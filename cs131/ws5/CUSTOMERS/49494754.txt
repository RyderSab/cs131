Very plainly, this volume is completely animated with theory--theories which are neither just to Virgil nor compatible to the Virgilian tradition.  This \\"companion\\" is ultra-modern in approach, so it is anachronistic in effect.  Virgil, his devotees, his commentators, his imitators, and his worthy translators, would not comprehend, nor desire to comprehend, the methods strewn through the pages of this volume.  Read Virgil in isolation from this book, and with the reverence that is his due; and if this is not sufficient, then seek the guidance of the ancients or that of their successors, the Humanists.	2005-04-24

While this book lacks the eloquence and depth of Gibbon, and reads more like reference material than pure history, it still must be regarded as the foremost authority upon the subjects it covers.  The only real negative about this immense work is the fact that rarely is anything said about culture.  Its hard to believe that a book illuminating the history of the provinces has almost entirely overlooked the cultural impact Rome had on the provinces and likewise that the provinces had on Rome.	2005-04-24

For his natural, straight-forward system of applied ethics made philosophy a way of living for the whole of the Roman populace.  Truly, it was not just the singular privilege of educated wealthy aristocrats and politicians to realize the Stoic ideal, but it was also within the power of uneducated slaves and lower-class-citizens to embody those virtues as well, as the example of Epictetus clearly shows.  Now, here presented in this piecemeal selection of Seneca's works, one may first come to meet this exemplar of Stoicism face-to-face in every genre he ever wrote in, with the exception of his Tragedies and his only extant Satire entitled, The God Claudius.  Furthermore, these short extractions from Seneca's relatively immense corpus of writings are rich in allusion and anecdote, and they are packed with profoundly helpful advice on how to endure life's hardships and how to enjoys life's benefits to the fullest as well.  This little volume will be a great introductory source for Roman Stoicism and it will compel readers to pursue the greater portions of Seneca's superb works.  One may discover the complete surviving body of Seneca's writings in text and translation within the invaluable editions of the Loeb Classical Library (Harvard).	2005-04-10

To begin, Father Ramsey offers us a finely written fifty-page intro that will acquaint readers with all the essentials of Ambrose's life and times; he also hands us helpful chapter headings for every text available with exhaustive footnotes for further aid; and at last, he furnishes a complete critical catalogue of all St Ambrose's works, listing those reasoned to be genuine, doubtful, or utterly spurious.  Of St Ambrose's writings, three of his treatises will be discovered here: (1) On Naboth (2) On Virgins and (3) On the Mysteries.  One of his exegetical pamphlets is given, The Prologue to the Commentary on Luke, and four of his outstanding Hymns, are available in both the original Latin and the new English.  And finally, the famous Letters Concerning the Altar of Victory are present within this compact edition.  Yet on top of this, Father Ramsey places a valuable complement to this selection of works--he adds the very reliable account of the Life of St Ambrose written by Paulinus of Milan, a first-hand source for the time and an acquaintance of both Ambrose and Augustine.  Now the overall estimate for Father Ramsey's Ambrose is a good one, since it readily makes a portion of the saint's writings accessible to general readers, namely those less likely to encounter Ambrose in the original Latin or in the older rigorous English translations.  His choice of Ambrose's oeuvre, however, could certainly have been broadened a bit.  It would have been a mark in the positive direction to have seen excerpts from On the Duties of the Clergy or On the Holy Spirit provided as well.  But this might have proved too excessive for Father Ramsey's purpose--to display the many attributes of St Ambrose within a \\"limited number of pages.\\"  So in respect of the writings selected here and in the fashion they are presented, it would be an injustice to deem this book anything less than worthy of honor and good repute. For it should be regarded as priority seek and a privilege to possess.  (Other volumes printed concern Irenaeus of Lyons and St Maximus the Confessor.

(Loeb Classical Library, No. 151) (English and Latin Edition)	Books	4	8	8	N	Y	Ovid--A Master of Latin Exile Literature	In antique Latin literature, writings composed by great men in exile evolved, over time, into the consolation genre. In utilizing this method, the author usually addressed his far away loved ones with soft elegaic poems or epistles intended to be therapeutic to both the sender and recipient. At times, this genre could even take on a sarcastic and vituperative tone. Enemies, rivals, and unfaithful friends or lovers, were commonly exposed to the exiled author's wrath. Some major figures in this tradition were illustrious men like Cicero, Seneca and Boethius.  Within the scope of this epoch, Ovid plays no minor role. For the Tristia and the Pontic Epistles influenced many subsequent Latin authors, while continuing to be widely read and highly regarded throughout the Middle Ages. For certain, in the most unanimously favoured book of the Middle Ages, the Consolation of Philosophy, significant traces of Ovidian influence are quite apparent in the prose and poetry portions of Boethius' work. So the overall value of this collection of letters should not be taken lightly. But the high-standing of the Tristia and Ex Ponto within the tradition of Latin literature is not the works only claim to merit. From this volume, we learn much about Ovid's character, while we are left with a sufficient impression about his place of exile. Also, his short autobiography is invaluable: it furnishes much material about his life and family history that otherwise would have been lost. Other historical content will be of use to the historian. For the poet, there are some pointers on how poetry should be written, and there are some helpful first-hand allusions about great poets like Ennius Statius, Virgil, Tibullus and Propertius. The poems themselves are very good and enjoyable to read; the only draw-back to them is the subject-matter, which becomes redundant and almost pathetic if read in large doses. However, this was not a fault, but rather a matter of Ovid's condition. He adjusts his Muse to fit his situation. In exile, he writes consolatory poems. Ovid himself points this out many times in these epistles. This volume is highly recommended. The Tristia and the Pontic Epistles will help students of the liberal studies cultivate many virtues of character, taste, and literary style, which will later prove to be beneficial to all facets of society.fit his situation.

What one will encounter, then, while reading their works, is what may be perhaps the finest manifestation of Roman Love Poetry that has been passed over to us through the ages.  With the exception of Propertius or Ovid, Catullus and Tibullus have no rival when it comes to the art of love poetry; and one may argue that the former poets only surpass the later in their bulk of extant poems and in their depth of subject-matter. Also included in this volume, is the Vigil of Venus, a warm and colorful poem attributed to a certain Tiberianus, who belongs to much later time, likely during the reign of the Antonines.  As the introduction points out, the Vigil of Venus contains the first piece of Romanticism to be found in Western Poetry. It is a poem of exceptional merit, and it is not unworthy of the majesty of Catullus and Tibullus.  Taken as a whole, students of Latin Literature, and poets of our day, have much to learn and enjoy by reading these noble classics.	2005-01-14

Patrick Collison's Reformation: A History, is off the mark, for it fails to produce the overall effect that the title suggests.  It is not a history, in the true sense, for his subject matter is buried too far in obscure theory and it lacks precise modes of chronological sequencing (time-ordering of people, places, things, causes and effects) .  This work is more like a mixed bag of essays, which insufficiently treats subjects tied to the Reformation.  Also, Collison writes in distasteful, unbalanced, and unpolished prose, and so does not even add a rhetorical coloring to his already stale and humdrum work on the Reformation.  Of the hundreds of works to turn to for guidance to knowledge of the Reformation, Collison's is not even suggested among those.  Instead, consult Diarmaid MacCulloch, Will Durant, or Phillip Schaff, for authoritative works on the Reformation.	2004-12-26

His admirable efforts as a poet, politician, father and schoolman, won him the lofty title of consul and fame that echoed to the ends of the Empire.  As a poet, it would be safe to say that he fails to surpass his younger contemporary Claudian, although at times--for instance in his Moselle--Ausonius rises to Virgilan mastery.  The poems preserved in these two volumes are various and diverse in their versification and style; and their contents are a more valuable source for history than for their merit as pure Latin verse.  Nevertheless, occasional brilliance marks the elements of Ausonius' writings; his faults as a poet are to be dismissed due to the flaws of his age.  This volume is a definite recommendation for students of the Later Roman Empire.	2004-09-10

This Golden Age was the hallmark of Latin literature; it was an age where poets enjoyed idyllic leisure and generous funding for their works.  Propertius belonged to the elite class of poets who wrote at the behest, and under the patronage of, the magnanimous Maecenus.  Propertius thrived in this company of poets which comprised of masters like Horace and Virgil.  Others too of his time were Tibullus, Catallus, and Ovid.  For this reason, he is not as well known today as he should; he will always linger in their shadows, but majestically and with the piercing light of respect.  The Elegies of Propertius are divided into four books according to their subject matter.  Throughout the work, Propertius is primarily occupied with love poetry--with his more than likely fictitious mistress, Cynthia.  At times he moves to different themes but his muse invariably takes him back to the \\"service of Venus.\\"  It would be detrimental for anyone who enjoys Latin poetry to pass this gem-of-a-volume up.  Even for the lover of contemporary poetry, the Elegies contain strikingly modern elements agreeable to modern tastes; and this updated edition is rid of the linguistic archaisms found in the earlier Loeb editions.  This is a must have for all poetry lovers.	2004-08-27

In this genre, modes of interpretation are various and always open-ended; and it is usually the author's purpose to keep it as such.  The first text in this volume is Petronius' Satyricon, a Latin novel which closely resembles the later work of Apuleius, The Golden Ass.  The stage for the tales in the Satyricon are set in the rural south of Italy.  The stories in the Satyricon are bawdy and full of everything that a hedonist of the Neronian period would agree upon.  It would be somewhat unnecessary to lay out the plot line since the narrative is often times difficult to follow and the surviving text is fragmentary.  Petronius' merit as an author and poet, for the most part, lies in the effect his writings had on the generations to follow.  The second work in this volume is the great Seneca's Apocolocyntosis or Pumpkification of the Divine Claudius.  This short work is a biting satire--which is quite humorous--aimed at the shamefully deified emperor Claudius.  Essentially, it is a work which purports to \\"undiefy\\" the insane emperor and send him to Hades where he belongs.  Overall, these two works are moderately enjoyable.  For the poet or satirist there is a wealth of material to draw upon, for people like Erasmus and Rabelais found much to digest in them.	2004-08-27

On the surface it would seem to the general reader that many important writers of the age are left out.  Individuals like Jerome, Lactantius, Ambrose and Athanasius are not even treated and are rarely mentioned at all.  Although Glover has his reasons: instead of focusing on polemic and controversy within the Church, Glover chooses to survey the works of the grammarians, rhetoricians and philosophers in order to show their impact upon the literary and social circles of the late Roman world.  In other words, Glover wishes to paint portraits of the fourth centuries most progressive authors.  For instance, the Emperor Julian wrote to promote his new pagan program, the poet Prudentius broke through as being the first real Christian poet and Augustine provided the world with his unique and illuminating Confessions, which resembles the autobiographies of today.  With this said, Glover only goes as far as necessary to treat his subject, even though a dozen more prolific men of genius could be added.	2004-07-26

In this work, Horace gives modest moral and social instruction to his correspondents, while in his Odes and Epodes his lust for life and the beautiful give the reader something much more palatable to digest.  What one will find here that may be the of most value is his Ars Poetica, which hands the novice some well-gained advice on how to write good poetry.  This work also furnishes itself as an excellent historical source into the world of the Augustan Age.  Overall, it must be said that these poems are not quite as entertaining as his Odes and Epodes, yet the reader must consider Horace's purpose in writing them before making any rash judgements.

It is a playful satire containing the use of many different genres, much like one would find in the Mennepian satires of Petronius, Seneca, Fulgentius, or Macrobius.  It is a complex and enthralling work in which interpretation is always open-ended.  Apuleius' use of allegory, his exceptional talent for imagery, and his rhythmic and often poetic prose, make this text a challenge and a joy to read at the same time.  The Golden Ass is definitely a masterpiece of Latin literature and can also argue of being the world's first novel.	2004-07-08

In the second treatise, the Academica, which unfortunately only the second half survives, Cicero deals with the epistimological views of the Old and New Academy and demonstrates that their views are compatible rather than conflicting.

John Marenbon's Boethius (Great Medieval Thinkers) is a storehouse for the main principles of Boethius' Greek Neo-Platonism, Christian Theology, Aristotelian Logic, and Latin literature, all of which left there mark upon later thinkers.  In this work, Marenbon begins by reconstructing the historical aspects of Boethius' life, such as his rise to being elected Consul up to his tradgic fall on account of the trumped-up charges of treason placed upon him by the Gothic regime.  Also in this historical sketch, Marenbon vindicates the Christianity of Boethius while detailing the intricacies of his famous text the Consolation, which makes no outward mention of any alliance with Christianity.  Also detailed  summaries are given as to his musical, astrological, mathematical, logical, theological, and philosophical works.  Of these, particular attention is paid to Boethius' logical and philosophical writings, for the obvious reason that this is what consumed most of his time.  Despite this, Marenbon's is a study which is most comprehensive and well-rounded, one that is quite similar to Henry Chadwick's in scope and worth.  Overall, it should be said that this work should be used foremost as a model for the interpretation of the Consolation, in respect of the insights and suggestions he throws upon the text.  Also the reader will be impressed with a more than satisfactory understanding of Boethius' logical, theological and philosophical systems as well.

Migne entitled Patrologia Latina.  So this edition is ground-breaking to say the least.  In this much-needed work, Stump has provided philosophers, students and scholars with the first text translated outside the original Latin.  In part one, Stump presents a concise and insightful introduction with extensive notes covering points addressed by Boethius throughout the treatise.  Also, in part two, Stump provides a detailed analyses of Dialectic in Ancient and Medieval Logic, which ultimately proves the important role Boethius played in the transfer of knowledge from the ancient to the medieval period.  At last it must be noted that the reading found here is anything but elementary; it is not recommended for anyone who has no former experience with the study of logic.  Eleanore Stump herself explains in the intro that Boethius' work is highly advanced.  Students are recommended to either cultivate patience and perserverance in order to tackle the nature of this text, or else they should consult their mentor or professor for guidance.  Overall, this work is a treasure brought out from oblivion, which is now accessible for anyone seeking a greater understanding of the study of dialectic or in the influence of the great philosopher Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius.	2004-02-03

While On Nature, Contemplation and the One remain singularly important as a part of Plotinus' massive body of work, it still stands, nevertheless, that it is difficult to understand the whole of the Alexandrian philosophers thought with merely a portion of his writings.  This pamphlet only engenders injustice for both Plotinus and for Thomas Taylor, the worthy translator of this text.  For nearly the same price one may find Stephen MacKenna's much more scholarly edition of Plotinus' Enneads, which contains the following: a biographical sketch of Plotinus, an essay concerning the philosophers place in the history of thought, an insightful introduction, Porphyry's life of Plotinus, the preface and finally, The Enneads.	2004-02-03

In these two texts, the reader will find Cicero in all his eloquence artfully dicating the principles of what it means to be a good man and what it takes to create and consolidate states.  This book will leave a lasting impression upon anyone who pans through the pages of these two very important works of the great Marcus Tullius Cicero.

Of the works displayed here the reader will find Petrarch in all his refined literary grace and splendor; and the inquirer will no doubt be left impressed with his sharp exposition of suggestive ideas.  The great Lorenzo Valla also stands out in all his unique vigor, using the courteous method of the dialouge to impart his opinions on free will.  Giovanni Pico Della Mirandola, the youthful champion of liberal studies, is found here as well, spinning the artful web-of-a-work, Oration on the Dignity of Man.  A small portion of the giant corpus of Marsilio Ficino's works may also be digested: of the Latin scion of Plato's writings his Five Questions Concerning the Mind will only be discovered here.  At last, the Aristotelian Pompanazzi's essay concerning immortality and Juan Luis Vives short work, A Fable About a Man, will be found here as well.  Overall, the editors and translators should receive a gold-star for their efforts; the great men who wrote these treasured texts also deserve a place of precedence in the hall of histories men of literary and philosophical genius.  A lover of literature, classic or contemporary, should come to grips with this compendium of Renaissance texts.	2004-01-22

Stewart begins with the question of Boethius' Christianity-a question that has remained open-ended ever since Renaissance scholars, to a certain degree, began to differentiate between the Boethius of Christian tradition and the Boethius of history.  Our author then moves on to detail Boethius' life from his birth, to his duty as a Roman senator, up to his trial and shameful execution.  Then Stewart provides a clear and concise summary upon the five books of the \\"Consolation of Philosophy,\\" and ultimately brings to light the philosophical elements of the work, namely God, the universe, fortune, chance, evil, and free will and predestination.  Next he analyses the five theological tractates attributed to Boethius and surfaces their subject matter, while coming to logical conclusions as to their authenticity of authorship.  Also, H.F. Stewart surveys the multifarious editions of the \\"Consolatio\\" which were translated into the vernacular tongues of the Middle Ages, while stressing Boethius' influence on authors like Dante, Aquinas, and Chaucer.  Finally, the author discusses the rise of the schoolmen, whose existence is owned, to a great extent, to the learned doctor Boethius.  This work is essential for anyone wishing to study Boethius; it has provided itself as a model for Boethian scholarship since its publication; and after a hundred years, Stewart's work continues to rekindle interest in the great Boethius.	2003-02-14

In \\"An Exorcist Tells His Story,\\" Amorth's aim is to stress the crying demand for the Catholic Church to cultivate a greater awareness of the concrete reality of evil in our world today.  He emphasizes the need for the Church to further elaborate and clarify on its teachings about diabolic possession. He also provides useful information concerning exorcisms, based upon his own personal experience, from his contemporary correspondents, and from the testimonies of others.  This information contains rudiments of the Rite of Exorcism, personal prayers of deliverance, tips on how to avoid evil influences and how to discern the symptoms of possession, and on who or what may be afflicted by evil.

It may have been written in reaction to the rising tide of Christianity, in order to promote the pagan reforms of Julian.  Nevertheless, the reader will find here a compendium of the Platonic philosophy, as Sallust comprehended it through the works of his predecessor, Iamblichus.  The student of Plato will find several ideas to play with in this treatise; and the assiduous collector of Greeco-Roman literature could hardly go without this on the shelf.  Although Platonism during this time was becoming an esoteric sect full of commentators bent on orthodoxy rather than free thought, Sallust's work is still unique if taken into context.  \\"On the Nature of the Gods and the Universe,\\" is interesting as a piece of religious propaganda and enlightening as a brief compilation of Platonic thought.  Also included here in Thomas Taylor's volume are the wise sayings of Pythagoras as recorded by Demophilus, several hymns by the great Proclus, and five hymns by the scholar Thomas Taylor himself.  This is a definite piece of Hellenism for the philosophical and literary enthusiast, and it is thoroughly recommended.	2002-12-23

Along with Scripture, Hahn authoritatively cites from the works of the Church Fathers and the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  In reading this work a variety of new insights, with regard to the book of Revelation, will stand out to the reader and leave new and interesting impressions about the mysterious book; and these insights will no doubt compel further study.  Hahn also briefly overviews the order of the Mass and draws striking comparisons with elements found in the book of Revelation.

Lerer begins by explaining the historical context in which the \\"Consolation\\" was written, then moves on to discuss the major influences behind the writings of Boethius--namely Cicero, Augustine, Fulgentius, and Seneca--and finally analyses the contents of the philosophers' theological tractates and the \\"Consolation\\" itself.  In this study, Lerer ultimately demonstrates the methodological and thematic coherence of the \\"Consolation.\\"  He also plots out Boethius' work in terms of the narrative's progress, which is written in prose and verse, and displays how he consistently rewrites earlier portions of the text into new contexts along the way to measure out the text's progress.  In a word, Lerer reveals the teacher student relationship between the personified Lady Philosophy and the learner Boethius, while demonstrating how the student progresses as the narrative proceeds.  This is a valuable piece of literary theory, and it will be warmly welcomed by anyone interested in the literature of the classical world.	2002-10-31

In this first volume, which covers Christianity during the Apostolic Age (AD 1-100), Schaff provides some excellent background information upon the Judeo-Pagan world that Christ was born into.  Then Schaff attempts to reconstruct the life of Christ, while he refutes the many theories posed by the skeptics of his time. He then moves on to the missionary work of the Apostles and provides a detailed sketch of each of their personalities; and he also summarizes the basic tenets of their writings and teachings.  Early Church doctrine, practice, and morality are other points that Schaff briefly overviews.  At last, the author analyzes the four Gospels, the Acts, the epistles, and the Apocalypse, and surfaces the literary content of the works along with the life and personality of the individuals who wrote them.  This is a great history, although some points of it are outdated.  Also, it must be related that Phillip Schaff saw the history of Christianity as a process of revelation which reached its goal during the reformation.  So he does have an agenda.  He holds a particular contempt for Catholicism; terms like \\"Romanist,\\" and \\"papist\\" are often used in a derogatory, vehement tone.  However, he is not altogether harsh towards Catholic Christianity.  Schaff's apparently espoused several views, favorable to Roman Catholicism, which caused him to be cited for heresy at the Church of Mercersburg in Pennsylvania. However, Schaff was eventually exonerated.  Overall, the contents of this work will be fulfilling and any library would be missing out not to have this collection of writings on its shelf.	2002-10-17

First off, Chadwick provides a fairly extensive sketch of the religious and political milieu of the declining west that Boethius was born into: the relations between Romans and Goths, Catholics and Arians, between Church and State, Platonism and Christianity, are all laid out in a clear and concise fashion.  This overview, while treating the aspects of Boethius rearing, education, and career, leads all the way to his tragic death.  From here, Chadwick begins his artful analysis of Boethius works: his exploits in the fields of music, arithmetic, geometry and astronomy are dealt with briefly.  Then Chadwick handles the efforts of Boethius within the fields of logic and rhetoric; he surveys the scholar's writings and commentaries upon the works of Aristotle and many of the preeminent adherents of the school of Neoplatonism.  Next, the Christian Theology of Boethius is surfaced through Chadwick's exposition upon the five theological tractates of the scholar.  And finally, Boethius' masterwork, The Consolation of Philosophy, is given a fairly extensive analysis which brings to light the religion and philosophy of the Saint [feast of St Boethius Oct. 23].  Overall, this is a comprehensive study of the last of the Romans, and first of the scholastics [as Lorenza Valla put it], which touches upon everything of primary significance in this great man's life and labor.  Possibly the most commendable feature of this work, is the fact that Henry Chadwick respectively placed Boethius in a seat of importance within the framework of the Early Church.  Here, the Legend of Boethius is turned into a concrete fact.  For Boethian studies, Chadwick's work may be the most resourceful and enduring.  It is to be considered the standard text for Boethius.to be considered the standard text for Boethius.	2002-10-17

The bold harangues of Greek and Trojan warriors and the artful intrigues of the gods, still resound within the imagination of the reader nearly twenty-eight hundred years after its composition. The Illiad is a definite recommendation for anyone; but for those not especially fond of the war-like, masculine tone, which underlies this work, then the Odyssey will be a much more rewarding read.

Perhaps this is true; but more truth may lie in the statement that he is the greatest moralizer of the Greco-Roman world.  Nevertheless, his voluminous collection of essays, dealing with moral philosophy, are deeply rooted in the Platonic tradition, with occasional seasonings of the school of Aristotle.  Plutarch draws from his encyclopedic knowledge of the mythological and philosophical lore of his time, along with his own personal experiences, in order to present and convey a moral through his straightforward prose and use of both Aristotelian and Platonic dialogue form.  These essays, much like Cicero's dialogues, are an attempt to layout a practical code of ethics for the aspiring student or sage.  Although, Plutarch differs from Cicero in the fact that nothing suggests that these essays were directed for popular use by the masses.  Already, only after a hundred years or so following the Republic's collapse, learning was being pulled away from public use and was being dragged into the schoolroom to be savored only by the well to do of the Empire.  Anyway, these essays make for an entertaining and edifying read.  Also the editor, Ian Kidd, furnishes comprehensive introductions, which throw significant light on the text.  The only drawback to this work is the absence of the greater part of Plutarch's essays; barely a third are given here.  These works should not be ignored; they are constantly overshadowed by his &#34;Parallel Lives&#34; but renewed interest in his moral writings are bringing these essays back to the fore of classical education.  They are a definite read for anyone interested in philosophy or classical literature.	2002-10-17

Of the poems he wrote in his native Italian, 366 have survived under the name \\"Canzoniere\\" (short-song).  Roughly 45 of the 366 poems are provided here in an excellent, faithful translation which steers clear of that cancerous and faulty element in poetry--the rhyme.  They were carefully selected for their content, so the discouraging number of 45 poems seems bigger when the editor's subtle discretion is taken into account.  The basis of these poems--like Dante's Beatrice and Catallus' Lesbia--rests mostly upon Petrach's undying love for Laura, but at times his verse resounds with political and religious themes, and with praises of Rome's past and the Italy of his own time.  Every poem will be an enjoyable read; they are always profound and inspiring in their glorification of feminine beauty; and the vivid and picturesque allusions to nature are always soothing and edifying.  One may easily see, after reading Petrach's \\"Canzoniere,\\" Horace handing Petrach his pen and Virgil his laurel crown, for they were as real to him as the lines of his poetry.  They guided him through the fields of Italy and lent him breaths of inspiration along the way.  Petrarch was anything but a mean and vulgar poet; he deservedly stands out as great amongst the greatest.  Also included are some short prose works (letters) which throw some significant light upon the life and character of Petrach.  This conveniently sized collection of the poet laureate's works is thoroughly recommended.	2002-09-24

He appears to have lived in Rome for nearly thirty-four years, under the patronage of the great Spaniard Senaca the Younger. He belonged to a class of intellectuals who were in resolute opposition to the emperor Domitian, so many times figures like Cicero, Brutus, and Pompey are used as literary devices against the crazed tyrant. Martial's poems are definitely modeled off of Catullus' epigrams and elegiac verses, although they are different in meaning and theme. These poems are hilarious and audacious, cruel, lewd, charming, spiteful, and creative; and they bring to life the social and political milieu of Rome. Martial's poems make for great bedtime reading and they are at their best when read in small doses. Michie's Anglo-cized translation, with a parallel Latin text, is good, however the rhyming couplet certainly does Martial's epigrams a grave injustice. The poems are excellent, although another translation is recommended; but another one will be hard to find which remains faithful to the original. The Loeb editions are always great, but the translators nearly always kill the original poetic song with dry early-twentieth-century prose.	2002-09-20

His bold and skillful invective, summed up in witty epigrams, and his gallant love/hate relationship with the famous Lesbia all bring forth sharp reflections upon human emotions and ultimately surface Catullus' own personality.  In these 116 poems, the reader will undoubtedly find something to relate to, even though they were written just over two thousand years ago.  Many of the themes found here are relevant to the modern mind and condition, and seldom are boring and obscure archaisms found in the text.

Then he moves into the Far East, where he handles Indian, Chinese, and Japanese civilization to the contemporary world of Will Durant.

And at times--mostly in the prologues to each of the calendars' months--Ovid takes his poetry to a level of creativity and depth that rivals his other poems; but unfortunately these are only short-lived.  Another setback to the \\"Fasti\\" is the fact only six months out of the calendar year remain (January to June).  It is up to question whether or not they were ever finished or simply didn't survive through the centuries; but nonetheless this misfortune is yet another hard knock for the \\"Fasti.\\"  It is certainly difficult to give Rome's most profound poet such a low rating, but when this is sized up with his other works, it doesn't stand a chance.	2002-09-19

Durant's primary focus is to furnish the reader with all the pertinent aspects of life in Renaissance Italy.  He accomplishes this with his customary talent for providing the reader with a lively narrative that brings the characters and the stage of history to life.  Durant's critiques of renaissance art and architecture, his overviews of the manners and morals of the time, his summaries and comments upon the principle pieces of humanist literature, philosophy, and poetry, are all carried with remarkable brilliance.

Pico mixes Platonic theology with Ciceronian eloquence and presents a piece of work that challenges the medieval view of human nature, while championing and embodying the \\"spirit of the Renaissance.\\"  With rhetorical genius, execution of style, and philosophical sublimity, this renaissance scholar, at the age of twenty-four, prepared this work as a preface to the startling number of nine-hundred theses, covering metaphysics, logic, ethics, theology, mathematics, magic, and physics.  The young Pico delivered this oration in the presence of well-educated men twice his age in order to convince them into a philosophical tournament, in which he would defend the principles of his nine hundred theses.  Sadly enough, his expectations were sapped since no one wished to accept his challenge; some of his theses brought forth papal condemnation; and a brief period of imprisonment followed.  His death at a young age certainly did not mean that his fame died with him.  Men like Erasmus and Politian admired him; and his influence on the modern world has been profound to say the least.

While several scholars have regarded this work as one of the best Latin poems ever, it must be taken into account that it is, nevertheless, far less entertaining than his famous \\"Aenied,\\" and much more difficult to read.  At times, in the \\"Georgics,\\" Virgil echoes with that same brilliance many people have come to love in the \\"Aenied.\\" But for the most part, this poem may be rigorous for anyone not serious about Roman poetry, so it is not recommended for everyone.  In context of Virgil's time, this poem easily gets five stars, but the many archaisms found in it tend to alienate modern readers, and so, with much hesitation, the poem receives only three.	2002-09-05

The \\"Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" may be said to rival and even surpass \\"Les Miserables.\\"  However, the depth, the insight, the idea of providence, progress, and revolution, all contrasted with the young and the old, the beautiful and the ugly, the happy and the miserable, makes for an invigorating, engrossing, and sometimes, disturbing read.

Monti's treatment of More's oeuvre is skillfully researched, comprehensive, informative, and pleasing to read.  St Thomas More's defense of Church unity and the Sacraments against Tyndale and the rising tide of the Reformation, is finely commented upon in a clear and concise fashion.  His devotional writings and correspondence with family in the waning days of his life on earth, are given an exceptional touch of intimacy, which will no doubt compel readers to seek out works such as the \\"Treatise upon the Passion\\" and the \\"Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation\\" (as one of our fellow reviews has pointed out as well).  As for More's life, Monti pays particular attention to his early years and his final days, with brief expositions in between on his rise in the King's court and his later relations with Henry VIII as tensions began to swell between the English monarch and the Papacy.  Overall, Monti presents a noble sketch of the Christian scholar and family man, graced with charm and good humor, conscientiousness and candor, who was devoted to his friends and family, and to the salvation of souls and Christ's Church.  This book offers much material for in-depth study and further reading, and it is a definite recommendation.	2002-08-05

Luckily, the author wastes no time presenting his prejudices in the foreword, so the reader may decide for himself whether or not to continue reading.  The basis of this work is James Reston's idea that the Christians were nothing but cruel, savage barbarians, who fought the Crusades under the guise of piety, while committing atrocities on a level second only to the Holocaust.  The Arabs, on the other hand, were enlightened, peaceful, and innocent peoples, guarding their land against European opposition.  However, Reston fails to point out that those lands were Christian three hundred years before the first Arab ever set foot in Jerusalem; and, furthermore, since 70 BC, Jerusalem had been annexed into the Roman empire by Pompey as property of the Western world. So their claims to the land certainly lack substance when the whole picture is looked at.  Anyway, the author's black and white portrait of the Crusades is outrageous and vexing: the Christians are bad and the Muslims are good; Richard the Lionheart is a homosexual and Saladin is a noble prince.  This analysis is enough to make someone sick.  Perhaps James Reston Jr. failed to mention he wrote this history in Baghdad under the patronage of Saddam Hussein.

Starr's comprehensive volume of ancient history from the early achievements of man to the decline of the Roman Empire, is remarkable in scope, charming in its clarity, and as a whole, impressive; but it is not to be compared with the work of Will Durant.  Like Durant, Starr focuses on the revolutions of history--which is the evolution of civilization--and completes his treatment of it in one 700-pg. volume.  If we are to compare the span of time handled in Starr's work with that of Durant's renowned \\"Story of Civilization,\\" then it may rightly be said that Durant took three-and-a-half volumes to cover the same period that Starr completed in one.  This makes Starr's work more accessible to students looking for summaries, while Durant's is more appealing to accomplished readers, seeking more in-depth research upon their desired subject.  Durant's always has a deeper feel for his subject and comments upon it with engaging philosophical insights, while Starr's narrative remains sketchy, and for the most part, humdrum.  However, this does not take away from the fact that Starr's \\"A History of the Ancient World\\" is one of the most noble of its kind, for its consolidation of such a broad period has been seldom matched.  The comparison with Will Durant is not to down play the worth of Starr's work; rather, it is to prove his worth, for every American historian looks to Durant as a source for inspiration, and as a model to attempt to emulate.  It is an honor to be placed in the company with someone of the likes of Will Durant, much in the same way that every English historian is indebted to Edward Gibbon and Winston Churchill.  His work is well worth its weight and renders itself as a carry-it-anywhere reference source for ancient history.  The contents cover the Paleolithic and Neolithic times, to the early civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, and the Indus Valley, Minoan, Assyrian, and Hebrew, into the classical times of the Greco-Roman world, all the way until the fall of Rome and the dawn of the Middle Ages.  The work also holds an abundance of maps, charts, and pictures, which make reading it all the more entertaining and fulfilling.

First off, D' Souza compares America to the Athens of old and explains just how with our fight against the Islamic fundamentalists, we are facing a new kind of Sparta.  He succinctly and sincerely delineates all the reasons why the fundamentalist factions within Islam hate us so much, and ultimately creates an eye-opening perspective, since the author places you in the shoes of the Easterner and allows you to see our situation in a different light.  Since the author is a native Easterner himself, it is interesting to see how he sizes America up culturally with the countries of his native land.  Dinesh D' Souza, moreover, discusses some aspects of America's past such as slavery, colonialism, and racism, in order to refute leftist intellectual groups, which believe that America has been nothing but an oppressive society, forcing its western ideals and values upon other peoples just to make a dollar.  He shows how, in comparison with civilizations in the past, that America is the only society which stamped out slavery, attempts to silence racism and bigotry, and which overall has done more to benefit third world countries through colonialism than hurt them.  Also, he faces arguments from both cultural conservatives like Pat Buchanon and also the Islamic fundamentalists, who claim that America is an immoral society.  In the end, D' Souza presents a reasonable defense for these well-grounded arguments and for the most part leaves the reader with a more optimistic view of American moral standards.  And at last, the author discusses the war on terror and just how we should go about fighting it and also asks us Americans to know what we are fighting for.  Overall, it is a work that will certainly implant a new perspective of what our country really is and what it needs to be.  It is a work that should be standard reading in our colleges and universities.ould be standard reading in our colleges and universities.	2002-06-27

In it, a wealth of background information will be found which ultimately and thoroughly lays the foundation for his treatment of the Bible's formation, completion, and rise to triumph.  But this work is certainly not a one-sided approach, merely telling the story of a bible.  McGrath's detailed coverage of the religious, political, and economical factors, from Gutenberg's press to the Colonization of America, sheds enormous light upon how the King James Bible actually \\"changed a nation, a language, and a culture.\\"  The reader will find, on top of this, an artful and detailed analysis of the King James Bible as a literary text.  And in dissecting the text, the author blends impartial criticism with will well grounded praise and gives the reader all the ups and downs of the text as a translation and as English prose.  Overall, it may be said that McGrath presents his information in an equitable fashion and charms the reader with his well-researched narrative and flowing prose.  The only argument contrary to the point addressed above is that he failed to rise above religious bigotry; he denies the fact that the Douay Rheims version of the Bible had any influence upon the KJV; he has nothing good to say about St Jerome's Latin Vulgate; and he reduces St Thomas More to nothing more than a foul-mouthed heretic hunter.  With that said, it must be noted that McGrath's work is most likely the best study of its kind.  Also included in this work is a bevy of illustrations, helpful charts, and an appendix, which provides a comparison of all the historical English translations.

Although, as may be seen from some of the people listed above, Durant not only treats Western Civilization but briefly touches on Eastern Civilization as well, making this work magnificent in its scope.

The epic meter, from which all the Latin poets modeled themselves off of, is discarded and the rhyming couplet is tragically substituted.  Peter Washington's reason for this is that the epic meter is only fit for longer poems.  Tell that to Horace, to Claudian, or to Virgil--tell that to any of the Roman poets and they would simply look at you with overwhelming disgust.  All of them wrote in iambic and daclyctic hexameter, that is, Greek heroic verse, or in basic Greek lyrical form, as may be found in the works of Catullus or Horace.  The rhyming couplet, then, was a fault all the ancient Greeks and Romans avoided both in poetry and good oratory; therefore it was completely alien to them.  The great John Milton realizing this said that it was \\"the invention of a barbarous age, to set of lame meter and wretched matter,\\" which inaugurated this tradition in English poetry, and therefore effected all their translations of the Roman poets' works.  Sadly enough, this volume was not spared from \\"the troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming.\\"  However, this volume does have its bright spots.  The editor's selection of Roman poets shows that he made a noble attempt to popularize some of the more obscure poets of antiquity, such as minor ones like Petronius Arbiter, Tibullus, Claudian, and Ausonius.  Also, what better way is there to make Roman poetry known than by placing it into the context of modern English poetry, in a small, pocket sized volume, under the label of one of the most prominent publishers to be found, Everyman's library.  Furthermore, the rhyming couplet at times--and the editor's minimal selection of lyrical verse--can be pleasant and bring forth deeper meaning out of the poetry.  And at last, the detailed and vibrant illustrations, relevant to the poet and theme of their poetry, make flipping through these pages and reading aimlessly an engaging effort, worthy of leisure.  In this anthology the Roman poets are Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius, Ovid, Seneca, Petronius Arbiter, Martial, Juvenal, Claudian, and Ausonius.  This volume may come as a disappointment to those seeking to find these poets' works translated to the fullest degree in their original genre, but it still remains a good anthology, noble in scope, and charming in its simplicity.And at last, the detailed and vibrant illustrations, relevant to the poet and theme of their poetry, make flipping through these pages and reading aimlessly an engaging effort, worthy of leisure.

These poems, collected here in David West's translation of Horace's \\"Odes and Epodes,\\" are some of the most charming, warm, lovable, and humorous works to be found among the Roman poets of the Augustan Age, even though they may be equally full of both piercing sarcasm and fierce invective.  In the Epodes Horace brings forth, through his unprecedented use of the Greek iambic meter in Latin form, the praise due to his patron Maecenas, the mild reflections upon the pastoral life, the pangs of love and war, and the personal sorrows of the defeat suffered at Phillipi.  In the Odes, Horace moves on from the iambic meter to the early Greek genre of lyric poetry such as may be found in the works of poets like Alchaeus and Sappho.  Furthermore, in the Odes, Horace muses upon friendship and relations with women, offers hymns to the gods and honor to Augustus, and at the same time reveals the typical Epicurean's \\"love for the moment.\\"  With the addition of Suetonius' brief but very important \\"Life of Horace\\" and the noble \\"Secular Hymn\\" dedicated to the dignity of the Augustus' new state, David West's translation will be a welcoming edition for everyone.	2002-05-10

Cicero, furthermore, attempts to use these virtues to the direct benefit of the individual citizen and ultimately to the dignity of the Commonwealth.

He attempted this not only by acting as the primary mover of the Florentine academy, but also through his magnanimous patron Cosimo de' Medici who apportioned Ficino the leisure to commence his monumental work, \\"The Platonic Theology,\\" which is offered here for the first time in a long-awaited English translation. Marsilio Ficino's work--from what may be seen from the first of five anticipated volumes--is an artful, straightforward representation of the divine philosophy of Plato, magnificently garbed under a brilliant and definitive medieval synthesis. Of the work itself Ficino says, \\"the Platonic mysteries are set forth as clearly as possible...so that...we may reveal the Platonic teaching, which is in complete accord with the divine law.\\" Like all Christian-Platonists, Ficino used Augustine as a model for his orthodox amalgamation of the teachings of Plato and Christ, and believed so strongly in it that he said, \\"the Platonic teaching...is related to the divine law of both Moses and Christ as the moon is to the sun.\\" With this in mind, it may be said that the vision of Marsilio Ficino, so clearly manifested in this work, will come as a relief to anyone ardently devoted to the school of Plato and the religion of Christ. The translated works of Ficino are certainly a great benefit to those confined to the English speaking world, and the other up-and-coming volumes in new I Tatti Renaissance Library (Harvard) are likely to produce the same effects. The value of these newly translated masterpieces of western culture cannot be described.	2002-04-25

Many documents and decrees, early church liturgies and hymns, along with an abundance of letters and tracts from the most illustrious and prolific authors of our Christian past are preserved here as well in a complete and clear turn of the century English prose translation. Moreover, this 38 volume set includes the principle writers of the Church from St Clement of Rome, a contemporary of St Paul, to St John Damascene, the last of the Eastern fathers who wrote during the 8th century AD.  In the West, Pope Gregory the Great's works are the last included in this series, since the end of his pontificate essentially marks the West's shift from the world of late antiquity into the dawn of the Dark Ages. Arguably, some works by Latin authors like St Benedict, Isidore of Seville, Prudentius, Sidonius, and Rufinus of Aquiliea should have joined the ranks with other Western fathers, since the editors saw it necessary to place in the works of John Damascene, who wrote well over a century later than Isidore, the latest of the authors listed above.  However, the editors judgement to place St Gregory the Great as the last of the Western fathers may be vindicated, although to leave authors like Prudentius, Rufinus, Sidonius, and Benedict out, who all wrote and thrived before Gregory's birth, may be open for scrutiny.  Also, these works are all translated and edited by Protestant scholars and divines, so the footnotes, prefaces, and profiles of these Church Fathers and their works tend to be shrouded with Protestant leanings.

It may be said that he was by birth an Egyptian and by manner a Greek.  Much like Manetho, Berossos was a priest who thrived during the Hellenistic world's apogee. He also sought to reconcile his Chaldean herritage under the guise of contemporary Hellenistic forms.  Furthermore, he too wrote his history in Greek, documenting the annals of ancient Mesopotamia to his current time.  Despite the fact that our knowledge of Egyptian and Babylonian antiquity would be far less extensive without these ancient writers' works, it should be noted that on the whole these works are anything but the delicate merging of eloquence and history customarily found in the Greek writings of his time. They are, on the other hand, a loose fragmentary compilation of documents concerning religious rites and reign by reign accounts of the great kings and pharaohs of Egyptian and Babylonian antiquity.

The many personalities that marked the spirit of the Renaissance are covered here as well with charm and uncanny brevity.  Through Johnson's clear and compelling narrative, figures like Petrarch and Erasmus, Leonardo and Donatello, are all brought to life and resound with the insights and achievements that were the sole mark of their character.  Paul Johnson's work is, on the other hand, recommended for individuals more inclined to the artistic rather than the literary side of the Renaissance.  For he pays no attention at all to poets like Tasso and overall fails to provide any single illuminating analysis of the Renaissance authors' works-to even say that his treatment of their works is a summary would be a complete injustice.  However, he does manage to paint a good picture of their lives and accomplishments, which will suffice for anyone not seeking to obtain an in-depth grasp of the literary milieu of the age.

This work will be a highly informative, quick read, which will be of profound interest for anyone enthralled by the world of classical antiquity.	2002-04-15

Then, moving into the Gnostic texts, Jonas discusses the meaning of \\"gnosis\\", as the ancient man understood it, along with other terms pervasive throughout Gnostic literature.  At last, in part one, Jonas describes the extent of the Gnostic movement, and ultimately sets the stage for his in-depth analysis of the various schools and Gnostic systems of thought in part two, namely those of Simon Magus, Marcion, Valentinian, Hermes Trismegistus, and the infamous Manes.  In part three, Jonas deals with the Gnostic cosmology and morality, with some of the new discoveries in the field, and finally, in the epilogue, he closes with a dissertation on Gnosticism, Existentialism, and Nihilism.  Hans Jonas' work, overall is an excellent, comprehensive study of the multifaceted belief systems of the Mediterranean World.  While his treatment may exhaust even the most concentrated of readers, it nevertheless will furnish such a wealth of knowledge that it will act as a superb reference tool and will be a valuable source for religious, cultural, or philosophical studies.	2002-04-11

It also fails to furnish itself as a comprehensive, scholarly overview of the spectacles, which caught a hold of the everyday passions and imagination of Roman civilization.  Instead, this work is something in between.  It is neither impressive or, on the whole, disappointing.  In this work, Auguet briefly touches on the nature and origin of the Circus Maximus, the gladiatorial combats, the hunts, and the patrons and factions which provided funds and fueled the populace to back these extravagant and brutal events.  The process of recruiting men and beasts, is a subject in Auguet's work, which carries significant merit in interest and depth.  Just how the gladiators, who were notoriously born of humble origins, rose to the status of superstars by the arts of the sword, is another aspect of this work deserving of recommendation.  The prose style used in this work, on the other hand, is at times fluid and completely in tune, however other times it is difficult to follow, awkward, and is distasteful to read.  Again, there are many terms the author uses that will be difficult for anyone seeking for an introduction to the games to discern.  The short glossary in the back does some justice to this minor setback though.  Overall this work should not be discounted; but it is not a recommendation.  Instead try Michael Grant's \\"Gladiators.\\"	2002-04-06

The crux of this work lies in Angus' erudite analysis of the various factors which facilitated the spread and subsequent decline of the Mystery-Religions, and likewise the factors that ultimately aided the spread and triumph of Christianity.  He is clear in his presentation of key points and sincere with the information he provides.  Angus' deep familiarity with both the ancient texts and the current modern scholarship of his times, on the whole, presents a well-researched work valuable for students and scholars alike.  This work is an enduring masterpiece, which offers readers a complete and useful tool for understanding the multifaceted belief systems of the Mystery-Religions.	2002-03-21

Butterworth	Books	5	50	50	N	N	&quot; A Sublime Masterwork&quot;	Of all the great Origen's works, his \\"On First Principles\\" was the most monumental.  It was the first attempt to formulate a coherent system of Christian philosophy, and it also is the best expression of the theologian's general opinions.  The work is divided into four parts: book one essentially deals with God and creation, book two with creation (rational and irrational natures), providence, and redemption, and book four with the interpretation of Holy Scripture.  Origen's views are based upon the authority of the Scriptures and Church tradition, and his theology is grounded upon the tenets of Neoplatonism.  In \\"On First Principles\\" many erudite and sublime maxims are given as to the nature of the Trinity, the person of Christ, and man's free will under the hand of Providence, most of which are considered Orthodox teachings.  On the other hand, the principles found in this work, which engendered controversy and were later condemned (Fifth Ecumenical Council 553), are the pre-existence and transmigration of souls, and universal salvation at the consummation of the world.  So, it will be safe to say that this Christian, the most original and influential thinker until St Augustine, is always sincere in his faith and strictly orthodox wherever reason and curiosity failed to take him too far.  This edition, being Koetschau's English text translated from Rufinus' definitive Latin volume, contains selected fragments of St Jerome's rendition and the meager remains of the original Greek texts in order furnish a more comprehensive view of Origen's writings.  Also included are in-depth introductions to Origin's life and works by the scholar G. W. Butterworth and the eminent Henri Cardinal de Lubac, the French Jesuit theologian and Church historian.  This work is highly recommended for anyone interested in patristic studies	2002-03-18

These letters are indispensable for historians of the period; they display the religious conflicts of the time, between warring Christian sects in North Africa and between the pagans who were in revolt due to Theodosius' all out ban on pagan sacrifice.  These letters provide significant secular information too, on issues such as the insurrection of Count Boniface and the Vandal's gradual occupation of N. Africa.  Furthermore, these letters paint a very good picture of the times, of Augustine's life and character, along with other eminent men in the Later Roman Empire.  Contained here as well, is an excellent, more antiquated English translation of his \\"Confessions,\\" which has endured among the multifarious modern versions today.  The in-depth chapter headings and annotations place this particular version above the many abridged editions today, making it more comprehensive and fulfilling to students and scholars alike. This edition also has, preceding the \\"Confessions\\" narrative, Augustine's own \\"Retractations,\\"which were written soon before his death in order to criticize and summarize all his works.  Phillip Schaff's sketch of the \\"Life and Works of Augustine\\" as an introduction to this volume adds all the more to this brilliant collection of the Great Saint's works.  This is a must have for anyone serious about St Augustine or Patristic studies.	2002-02-27

The works contained here are divided into six categories: dogmatic, exegetic, moral, sermons, letters, and hymns.  Since there are so many works, both minor and major, it is only necessary that Ambrose's most significant ones should be listed.  His \\"On the Duties of the Clergy\\" represents, in a way, that of Cicero's work four and a half centuries earlier.  Also, \\"On the Holy Spirit\\" and \\"The Catholic Faith\\" are preserved here, and they were apparently written, at the behest of the emperor Gratian, to the general public in order to define, defend, and justify the Divinity of Christ in the face of the swelling Arian party in Northern Italy.  Of his moral works, \\"Concerning Virgins and Widows\\" and \\"On Repentance,\\" will be found here as well.  In a word, St Ambrose's letters reveal some of his famous conflicts with the pagan Prefect of Rome, Symmachus, who wished to install the Altar of Victory back into the senate-house of Rome, after it had been taken out under the command of Gratian.  And again, his letters reveal the conflict between the bishop of Milan and the emperor Theodosius over the massacre at Thessalonica, which, after the Emperor was excommunicated for this deed, ended up prostrate at the Bishop's feet, ultimately depicting the first triumph of Church over State.  All in all this volume is great for the study of the Early Church both historically and dogmatically.	2002-02-26

MacMullen systematically renders an insightful overview of the different transitions in the process of Christianization as follows: first the period from New Testament evangelism (as found in the Epistles and the Acts) to Constantine's conversion, and the period following after the emperor's conversion all the way to AD 407.  MacMullen does not discount the more customary viewpoints held by scholars such as Edward Gibbon and J.B. Bury, or, for that matter, traditional ecclesiastical interpretation as well; he does add to them though; and this is his most remarkable feat.  He manages to maintain a balance between the secular and the ecclesiastical, in turn offering food-for-thought for all readers.  Ramsey MacMullen's work deserves praise and possible precedence even over the renowned scholar Peter Brown's works, which bear a similarity to R.M.'s but lack the same objectivity.  While his style of prose is a bit unseasonable and skewed at times, the work, overall, will undoubtedly come as a relief and reward to anyone yet to be familiar with it.	2002-02-26

Just how Theodosius reacted to these conditions and the subsequent affect they later had on the empire is the basis of this work.  His diplomatic feats and failures, his military maneuvers and achievements, and his religious swing from tolerance to universal bigotry are fully covered here with clarity and unified scholarly ingenuity.  A very clear account of the complex web of power between the East and the West, the emperors and their ministers, during the reigns of the indolent and feeble emperors Honorius and Arcadius, will be found here as well.  To find a more substantial and lucid account elsewhere of the principle policies during Theodosius' reign, of the German migrations and relations with Rome, the ambitions and downfall of Stilicho, and the final disintegration of the Western empire, will be a difficult task to say the least.

Claudian himself was very likely a heathen, since his poems obviously reveal pagan beliefs, while Christianity was only paid minimal lip-service; but perhaps his paganism was only a ploy to win senatorial favor.  Claudian was raised to a state of prominence in the court of the emperor Honorius by writing panegyrics and propagandist poems on his behalf; also, Claudian wrote several poems eulogizing the Germanic general Stilicho and the consuls Probinus, Olybrius, and Manilus.  Claudian's praise of the great general Stilicho and the emperor Theodosius may be totally justifiable, however, he never blushes to praise the degenerate weakling of an emperor Honorius, whose absolute lack of traditional Roman virtue, proved costly to the Empire.  On the other end, Claudian is just as extreme.  His satires on Rufinus, the corrupt \\"magister militia\\" of the East, and the eunuch consul Eutropius are hilarious and witty; he certainly had a talent for blending simple humor with sharp invective.  Of Claudain's many genre, the epic is another one he employs, for he wrote, in this particular volume, a short and unfinished work on the war and defeat of Gildo, the usurper in Africa.  On the whole, this Roman poet, originally a Greek author from Alexandria, shows great signs of the same skill, precision, and mythological lore found in many of the poets from the Silver Age.  Despite his shameless praise of Honorius, Claudian is a great poet, and his work is important for historians of the time and entertaining for anyone enamored with good Latin poetry.	2002-02-19

Caesar's first-hand account of his campaigns is very sincere and to the point, yet strikingly authoritative and deep at the same time.  Not a hint of arrogance or prejudice is found in his narrative as well.  His prose is eloquent, and certainly rivals some of the greater Latin authors of his age.  Of his ten commentaries extant, seven are contained here in his account of the Gallic Wars.  An additional eighth book was written by Aulus Hirtius in order to bridge the gap between the pacification of Gaul, through the Civil Wars, until finally Caesar himself resumes his narrative with his last three commentaries on the Alexandian, African, and Spanish Wars.  The work itself, of course, deals with Caesar's campaigns and relations with the Celtic and German tribes, the Celts in Gaul, and the German's east of the Rhine.  Although war is not the only issue Caesar records.  His interest in Celtic and Germanic culture is apparent since he provides much important evidence about the diverse tribes' way of life.  This information is treasured since the Celts, though literate, were forbidden by the druids to write, and also the Germans provided no single indigenous historian until Jordanes in the middle of the sixth century.  Overall, the commentaries of the Gallic Wars are a valuable source for the times and a definite work of profound literary merit.	2002-02-17

Brown ignores the inevitable vicissitudes of recorded history and offers a much more personal, subjective, and systematic account of the triumph of Christianity.  To Professor Brown, Christianity gradually emerged and ascended amongst a world deeply rooted in traditional Pagan \\"common sense\\" belief systems.  This process involved a shift in how upper-class Roman society conducted religious and political institutions; these institutions were in turn viewed by the general public, and at last Christianity was accepted and validated by the consensus of both stratums of society.  Brown concludes and confirms his view by pointing out the profound effect that the holy men of the fifth and sixth centuries had upon people of all walks of life.  This, from Brown's perspective, proves that Christianity needed to have a firm hold upon the psyche of the late Roman world and not merely upon the social and cultural levels.  In other words, Constantine's revolution was only half the story.  This work is clear and concise, and definitely has something to offer to both scholars and general readers alike.	2002-02-12

His deep knowledge contemporary archaeological lore, modern Celtic scholarship, and the original Greek and Roman sources, makes this work a reliable and trustworthy account of a nation often clouded by the mist of Mythology and obscured by the stigma barbarity.  Ellis begins his study of the Celtic peoples during the Bronze Age at approximately 1000 BC and concludes it at the conquest of Britain under the regiments of the emperor Claudius in AD 51.  Also, the epilogue covers some fascinating theories propounded concerning Celtic relations with the American Indians around 800 BC, and also about possible ties of kinship with the Etruscans - Ellis discounts these theories, but they are worth checking out nevertheless.  In general, the history focuses on the Celts struggle for freedom and identity against the pressure of an expanding Roman Empire.  So, what will be found here is a very good, in-depth overview of Roman and Celtic military history.  Little will be found here on Celtic law, philosophy, religion, and art, although it does contain much useful information on the Celt's language, achievements and contributions to Greco-Roman civilization and culture from Asia Minor to Ireland.  The only flaw to this history is Ellis' obvious contempt for anything Roman, branding them as ambitious, greedy, and cruel; this estimate of the Roman's may to a certain extent be justified, however, Ellis' over-emphasis grows a bit bothersome early in the work.  Apparently, to Ellis, anything that was good in Roman culture was inherited from the Celts.  Overall, an eager reader will find a peaceful medium between the impressions left from the original Greco-Roman sources and Ellis' Celtic bias.  This work should not be overlooked.	2002-02-11

This volume begins with Theodoret, the bishop of Cyprus' \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" which, much like the church histories of his younger contemporaries Socrates and Sozomen, opens during the rise of Arianism under the emperor Constantius and closes abruptly at the death of Theodore of Mopsuestia in AD 429.  Theodoret's history appears to have been written in order to fill the gaps and correct the errors where Socrates and Sozomen's efforts proved insufficient; he adds more original documents and decrees than them, but seems to care less for chronological accuracy.  Theodoret does surpass his contemporaries in eloquence, religious zeal, and invective; in this he resembles the later church historian Evagrius Scholasticus, whose works brim with orthodox fervor.  Of Theodoret's works his \\"Dialogues and Letters\\" are preserved here as well, and they are possibly more important than his church history for the fact that they provide significant knowledge on key persons and surface much information about the Bishop of Cyprus himself.  Some minor works also comprise this volume, namely Gennadius of Marseilles and St Jerome's \\"Live of Illustrious Men,\\" which are merely short documentaries on some of the primary influences in the Church from St Peter on; even a few non-Christians joined the ranks: Seneca, Philo, and Josephus.  Finally, a collection of works by Rufinus of Aquilea, who is best known for his correspondence with the saintly scholar Jerome, are presented here as well.  His commentary on the Apostles Creed, which is the first to have been written by a western cleric, is very important and interesting.  Also, his apologetic works, defending the orthodoxy of the sublime Christian philosopher Origen, are contained in this volume; these were written in reply to Jerome's anti-Origenist sentiments.  Rufinus' prefaces concerning his translations of Eusebius' \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" and some of Origens theological writings, show the motives of a man who rendered much of the Greek Church's storehouse of knowledge to the Latin Church. This accomplishment is much more significant and influential than his infamous controversy with St Jerome; it is just a shame that he is known most for a petty argument than for his translations.  The only thing lacking in this volume of Rufinus' works is his own \\"Ecclesiastical History,\\" which is comprised of two books.  His history should have been included here, but that is the only apparent flaw in the entire volume.  With the late nineteenth century English translations rendered here, these works are certainly not bedtime reading, or to say the least, easy to read.  Only the most concentrated and zealous church history readers should own and attempt to make use of it; others should remain content with more modern secondary sources.  This series is important since it boasts of more English translations of the Church Fathers than any other series, and many of the works here will not be found elsewhere.  Although, the Catholic University of America has a series much like the Nicene and P-Nicene Fathers, which is more modern and definitely worth checking out.' \\"Ecclesiastical History\\" and some of Origens theological writings, show the motives of a man who rendered much of the Greek Church's storehouse of knowledge to the Latin Church.

With the late nineteenth century English translations rendered here, these works are certainly not bedtime reading, or to say the least, easy to read.  Only the most concentrated and zealous church history readers should own and attempt to make use of it; others should remain content with more modern secondary sources.  This series is important since it boasts of more English translations of the Church Fathers than any other series, and many of the works here will not be found elsewhere.  Although, the Catholic University of America has a series much like the Nicene and P-Nicene Fathers, which is more modern and definitely worth checking out.	2002-02-08

From the Goths early migrations, incursions, and relations with Rome, all the way to transient dominance under Theodoric the Great and his lesser successors, Burns, the accomplished scholar, artfully blends his deep knowledge of the original sources with contemporary archaeological lore.  In doing so, he pieces together fragments of a civilization often clouded by obscurity and presents a work that grasps with clarity all aspects of Ostrogothic society: religion, warfare, art, administration, and the Goths social adaptations within the confines of the Imperial borders to name a few.  This work is likely to be the best study of its kind; Thomas Burns has much to offer.	2002-02-05

From Lucius Accius to Zosimus the historian, this reference work covers the general milieu of Greco-Roman civilization.  The detailed maps and timelines are an excellent study-aid, and also make up for the lack of illustrations throughout its duration.  This is an easily accessible and convenient reference tool, and for this reason it stands out above its counter-part, \\"The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization,\\" which is more bulky, expensive, and less appealing to anyone simply ready to deal with real people and real events.  However, this edition does to a certain extent deal with the many Mythological gods and heroes, with its in-depth analysis of Greek and Roman authors and their literature; for this, everyone will be satisfied.  Despite the absence of a few influential people, the five hundred people excellently portrayed here will suffice.  This reference work is thoroughly recommended.	2002-02-05

Chesterton's works are always witty and insightful, and his work here on St Thomas Aquinas, though lacking depth, is unique to say the least.  Throughout the work, the early twentieth century author presents light biological information with mere summaries and introductions to Aquinas' philosophy, which, for someone more enlightened might seem a bit jejune.  Also, instead of penetrating directly into the marrow of the Angelic Doctor's life and thought, Chesterton runs off the subject and is a bit too verbose; instead of two-hundred pages this work should have only been about fifty.  However, on the whole, Chesterton's work should not be discounted, since the information he does present paints and exceptional portrait of Aquinas' character, inside and out.  For the simple uniqueness and driving wit of this work, St Thomas Aquinas, \\"The Dumb Ox,\\" is a reluctant suggestion for anyone well-informed of the Saint's philosophy; but this work will be a rewarding read for anyone looking for a good introduction to his life (personality) and thought.  For those who have touched a higher stratum of Aquinas' thought, Ralph McInerny's solid and exhaustive work is a definite recommendation.	2002-02-01

His legacy is so great that his ideas are thought to permeate most of the philosophical tradition, from his era on.  Now the great philosopher's life and teachings, as represented by Thomas Stanley, the first English historian of philosophy, is thorough and excellently researched.  The only drawbacks to the work are this: that it was written in the middle of the seventeenth century, so the English is a bit obscure (the letter \\"S\\" is represented with the modern lowercase \\"f\\" without the crossbar); and finally, the text is also difficult to read at times since it is photocopied from the original.  Overall, with the helpful introductory essay and the invaluable information Thomas Stanley provides, this work is rewarding, and will be a great boon to anyone zealous about collecting rare books or for anyone simply interested in philosophy.	2002-01-25

He addressed the \\"Mediations\\"--which are written in Greek--to himself, and so the text has suffered at times due to careless composition; at times this causes his writings to appear awkward and grammatically flawed, though for the most part they are eloquent, poetic and full of wise sayings. To stress Aurelius deep knowledge of Greek philosophy, it most be noted that while he himself was committed the tenets of Stoic philosophy, his \\"Mediations\\" still contain elements of Platonism, and even Epicureanism as well.

This work has stood for so long as a classic monument of Latin poetry not only since it contains such a bounty of sweet verse and song, but also for the simple fact that Lucretius' work was the most modern for its time. This furthermore allowed \\"On the Nature of the Universe\\" to hold the reins of superiority--with regards to its modernity of course--for many subsequent generations. Lucretius' stark conviction that the world is not controlled by the gods, that man is solely in control of his destiny on earth, and that the soul perishes with the body, no doubt aroused the conservative sentiments of the time; and for this reason the work endures due to the epic and timeless battle between Science and Religion. For anyone interested in the Greco-Roman Classics, poetry, or just good literature, Lucretius' masterpiece will be an excellent choice.	2002-01-24

The epic was written during the reign of Nero in the first century AD, and it is characterized by its vehement condemnation of civil war and imperialistic sentiments--this possibly caused Lucan's later fall out of Nero's favor. The primary characters in the epic are Julius Caesar, who is portrayed as a destructive warmonger, and Pompey (Magnus), who is described as ambitious and over his prime. The vivid descriptions of the wars in this work are exciting and at the same time sobering since Lucan's narrative never fails to reveal those attributes of civil war which invoke the most disturbing of feelings. For all this, Lucan's \\"Civil War\\" is recommended, and also because the Oxford World Classics always present reliable translations, and this particular edition retains Lucan's charming and long-winded verse that courses so smoothly through the hearts and minds reader's who are fortunate enough to come into contact with it.	2002-01-24

The Consolation of Philosophy (Loeb Classical Library)	Books	5	14	18	N	N	&quot;A Collection of Masterworks&quot;	Boethius was certainly a bright spot in the midst of a darkening world flooded by barbarians and intellectually on the decline. Boethius was among the few commentators and compilers of his age who endeavored to preserve the tenets of Greek Philosophy. His commentaries and translations of the original Greek texts of Aristotle were the only Latin translations known to the Western world until the renaissance and ultimately paved the way for Aquinas' &quot;Summa Theologia.&quot; So, with this in mind, Boethius' works made a very significant impact upon the later scholastic philosophers, and to the whole of Catholic tradition as well. Italy, during Boethius' time, was under the rule of Theoderic the Ostrogoth, who unjustly imprisoned the statesman/philosopher, falsely accusing him of treason. While waiting for his execution, Boethius wrote his &quot;Consolation of Philosophy.&quot; The book itself is among the masterpieces of all time, and the only thing as tragic as Boethius' untimely death is the fact that we were not able to obtain anymore works from this genius with the golden pen. Had he remained alive, it is very likely that we would have seen a sublime synthesis, in Latin, of Plato and Aristotle, not contradicting each other but complimenting one another. However, in short, this book is a small manifestation of what may have happened if he lived longer. What is interesting about this book is that it handles several different perspectives, namely that of the sorrowful Boethius and the consoling wisdom of Lady Philosophy, written both in eloquent prose and dazzling verse, which together ultimately culminates into a one of the most moving, inspiring, and thought provoking philosophical works of all time. The book is indefatigable, in that it never seems to quit opening new corridors of thought; and it is essential, because it is the philosopher's ideal breviary. It is interesting to note - and this is certainly not a negation to his Christian convictions - that while this Saint was awaiting his execution he remembered Athens, not Calvary.  The other works contained in the volume are some minor Theological tractates: namely, &quot;De Trinitate,&quot; &quot;Utrem Pater Et Filius,&quot; &quot;De Fide Catholica,&quot; &quot;Quomodo Substanitiae,&quot; and &quot;Contra Eutychen.&quot;  While many individuals attempt to downplay Boethius' Christianity since &quot;The Consolation&quot; makes no direct mention of Christ, it nevertheless cannot be denied that many Christian elements underlay the theme of the work; and also it must be noted that when Boethius writes philosophy he is strictly writing philosophy and he writes theology he is strictly writing theology.

Through his efforts, the West was furnished with some of the greater works of Greek speaking ecclesiastics, such as the intelligent and infamous Origen's &quot;First Principles&quot; and the Semi-Arian bishop Eusebius of Caesarea's ground-breaking &quot;Ecclesiastical History.&quot;  Rufinus is also famous for writing the first commentary on the Apostle's Creed in Latin, and for his friendship with St Jerome, which tradgically ended in controversy due to their conflicting views on Origen's orthodoxy.  Of all Rufinus' works, he is most well known for his own &quot;Ecclesiastical History,&quot; which again was the first church history written in Latin.  Rufinus intended this history to be a continuation of Eusebius' narrative, which covered the principle events of the Church from Christ's ascension to Constantine's victory over Maxentius in 312 AD at Milvian Bridge.  Rufinus picks up his during the Council of Nicea in 325 AD and carries it all the way to 395 with the death of Theodosius the Great.  Much like Eusebius, Rufinus intends to display the truth and triumph of Christianity through the exploits of emperors, martyrs, confessors, theologians, and holy men; their tone and means of doing this, however, is slightly different since Rufinus was a Catholic and Eusebius was a Semi-Arian.  As history, Rufinus' narrative is chronologically flawed, but at the same time his work was used as a primary source in the later ecclesiastical histories of Socrates and Sozomen.  For information on the lives of SS Athanasius, Basil, and Gregory Nazianzus, little information is given as a whole; but when their accomplishments served to convey Rufinus' point concerning the triumph of Orthodoxy, some colorful and rich allusions are given.  It must be noted, also, that in the two short books of this history much of the narrative is soaked with tales of miracles, which are no doubt eloquent, entertaining, and necessary for Rufinus' purpose, but which are also disappointing for anyone looking for a treasure-trove of ecclesiastical events.  In other words, the history is merely two short books treated as a summary of events, containing more saintly legends than useful historical content.  Although, this does not totally demerit Rufinus' work, for the reasons addressed above, and for the fact that this is a rare find and a major recommendation for anyone seeking a deeper perceptive of the Early Church.  Moreover, Philip R. Amidon's first English translation of Rufinus' history is excellent because it preserves the Latin author's antique style in a modern translation, which makes it a quick and compelling read, while at the same time retaining the brilliant Latinate form of prose.  Rufinus' history should be brought out of oblivion and placed on the shelves of aspiring students and collectors of original historical works as well.d with tales of miracles, which are no doubt eloquent, entertaining, and necessary for Rufinus' purpose, but which are also disappointing for anyone looking for a treasure-trove of ecclesiastical events.

This history, which is divided into three volumes, traditionally is believed to have been written by six different authors under the supervision of Diocletian and Constantine; so the authors undoubtedly were not contemporaries of the events treated throughout this work.  Overall, since these biographies have sufficient historical content, and as a whole comprise one of the three other primary sources drawn upon for our knowledge of the times, it may be deduced with reasonable certainty that these biographies, though many times lacking connection and transition, correct chronology and overall cohesion, are a little more than what the editors have called &quot;literary monstrosities.&quot;  It is true, also, that nearly every letter and speech is fraudulent, and that several times the narrative is tragically doctored with fragmentary interpolations; however, in spite of this, these biographies are extremely important, and throw light upon an age that otherwise would have fallen into near oblivion.

So, from this first-hand source of More's life comes an intimate, unique and fascinating narrative of the principle events of his life; but mostly, the events described begin shortly before his elevation to Lord Chancellor, so for anyone looking for insight on More's early life, this work is not the one.  Although, on the other hand, for anyone seeking to find a dramatic account of More's tragic but heroic fate, or for anyone just looking to find a collective bevy of More's wise old sayings, Roper's work will be of inestimable value.  The only drawbacks to Roper's biography is that it is short, lacks scholarship, and fails in general to surface a clear portrayal of Thomas More's life and overall character.  Furthermore, with this in mind, it can easily be imagined how much more we would know of him if someone with much more depth and perspective as an author sought to comprise biography of Sir Thomas More instead.  However, had Roper not written at all, it may equally be envisaged how much we would have lost More's life.  So, in the end, Roper's work pays off for the details he provides, and for the fact that his familiarity with More engenders a certain level of confidence and reasonable reliability as a whole.  William Roper's work is indispensable for anyone serious about the study of Sir Thomas More.	2002-01-01

Cicero presents his thesis by opening a dialogue between three distinguished philosophers from the major schools of the first century BC: namely the Stoics, Epicureans, and Academics. Velleius, in book one, expounds upon the general tenets of the Epicureans; in book two, Balbus the Stoic in turn attempts to refute the claims made by Velleius; and finally, in book three, Cotta takes the position of the Academics, which should be understood as Cicero's opinions himself. If judged correctly, Cicero's opinions are quite clear, but they should be left for the reader to discover on his own. As pure philosophy, this book obviously lacks merit; but as for creativity and sheer eloquence Cicero's work will make for an entertaining and insightful read, especially as an introductory to the philosophical maxims during the decay of the Roman Republic. Despite the works lack of philosophical ingenuity, its influence may possibly be greater than what is customarily maintained, since it is likely that &quot;De Naturae Deorum&quot; impacted Boethius in writing his &quot;Consolation of Philosophy.&quot; First of all, both works address many of the same issues, and secondly in their literary style they both use prose and verse to convey meaning. Overall, this work will make for a comforting, and at times insightful read; this will be an essential addition to the classical library.	2001-12-31

Bertrand Russell's thorough account of the history western philosophy is divided most properly into three books: the first dealing with Ancient, the second with Catholic, and the final with Modern Philosophy. Russell's work begins with the condition of Hellenic civilization at the time of Thales of Miletus and ends during the time of Russell's own distinguished contemporaries.  Instead of dedicating a chapter soley to Thales, Russell deemed it more appropriate to deal singularly with Pythagoras first, simply because his influence was much more profound than Thales and others of the Milesian school. Likewise, while Russell suggests that Spinoza was a much greater philosopher than Locke, he nevertheless maintains that Locke's influence was far greater than Spinoza's, and that most appropriately more time should be dedicated to Locke instead. Although the basis of this work lies upon a particular philosopher's impact upon social and political sphere of life, Russell never fails to surface individuals with deep philosophical merit. In other words, Russell treats every principle philosopher from Pythagoras to Aquinas, all the way to his own contemporaries, despite how influential they may have been; but these individuals, though they may have been exemplary thinkers, are just dealt with much more briefly in regards to their lack of major influence. So, keeping this in mind, anyone looking to find a history of western philosophy that contains an abundance of great thinkers, with detailed summaries of their systems of thought and their influence upon the world, along with some very good general history, Russell's work should not be avoided.	2001-12-30

Detailed civil, administrative, topographical, and military analysis' underlay a significant portion at the start of this work; and they provide important information concerning the Empire's indelible shift and mutual balance of power between the two great cities, Rome and Constantinople.  Bury concentrates on the barbarian tribes that eventually made claims to independent sovreignty within, and on the fringes, of Imperial territory; and also on the emperors who ignominously ceeded it to them.  Bury also delves on the theological disputes, Church and State relations, and the Pagan and Christian sentiments towards the Roman world in transition and decline.  While this work is exhaustive and full of valuable research material, it still remains eloquent and interesting, containing an engrossing storyline througout its duration.

Plotinus was one of the originators of the philosophical discipline Neoplatonism, as it has been so-called by modern scholars; and his philosophical ingenuity has impacted the intellectual and spiritual world significantly.  Without taking any overt notice of Christianity himself, Plotinus' ideas still amazingly reflect numerous doctrines of the Church, such as the Trinity just not in terms of equality of divine persons but moreso in terms of subordinating deities from the One, to the Intellect, to the Soul.  Moreover, Plotinus' philosophical monism helped to repudiate the dualism of the Gnostics, nameley, the Manichaeans who were a common nemesis with the Platonic and Christian schools in Alexandria.  Now the beginning of this volume contains several dissertations on the life and thought of Plotinus, which provides excellent background information that will act as a helpful prelude to reading the Enneads.  As the Enneads were originally a collection of chatty essays and short articles compiled after his death, it interesting to note how clearly and intelligibly the translator Stephen Mackenna rendered this text.  Overall, it is a good volume, and should be on the shelves of anyone enamored with good philosophy.	2001-11-30

The work begins with a succint backround of Britain under Roman dominion, up to a more detailed account of Britain under the rule of Kentish and Anglo-Saxon kings; it ends nearly around Bede's own times(early 700's).  Some important letters are preserved within from Gregory the Great, which show how the young church in England corrisponded with the Church of Rome, and how many ethical and doctrinal matters were solved during the young Church's growth.  Unlike many of Bede's contemporaries, his narrative is never dull; and although he remains quite uncritical, the stories he tells are always charming and eloquent.  This is a great source to understand the Christianization of Europe...it is a must have.	2001-11-28

Also included is a short definition of the word apocrypha, which Kimball insists orginally meant &quot;one too sacred and secret to be in everyone's hands.&quot;  However, its etymoligical derivative, which is rendered into apocrypha by joining apo-(away)+kryptein(to hide)=Greek apocryphos, does not suggest Kimball's definition.  The stories found here are very interesting, and are full of tales not only of the young Messiah's life and deeds, but of the lives of Mary and Joseph, and the rest of Jesus' family as well.  While these hidden stories may seem a bit jejune to the sceptic, they will still nevertheless be a fascinating collection of extra-biblical stories for the individual seeking knowledge on the early life of Christ; and they will also be a fair study companion for the search of the historical Jesus.	2001-11-28

He did, however, visit Rome; and judging from his writings he new the Eternal City well.  Among the classic poets, Prudentius, as a Catholic Christian from the Later Roman Empire, may certainly be placed in a class with the greatest of his predecessors.  Like Virgil, Prudentius understood in great detail the Divine mission of Rome; instead of Virgil's Aeneas, Prudentius upholds Christ as the figure-head of Rome, and sees the empire's shift from paganism to Christianity as the ultimate fulfillment of the City's calling.  Prudentius is a poet, rather than a theologian, but this is quite difficult to tell, for the reason that he seems well informed of the theological maxims of his day, and for the fact that he incorporates them into his work in so much depth.  Prudentius uses his knowledge and eloquent verse to teach the Catholic faith, thwart heresy, and tell the many stories of the traditional figures in the Bible.  The first volume is comprised of the following: &quot;The Daily Round&quot;(a collection of pleasant hymns), &quot;The Divinity of Christ,&quot; &quot;The Origin of Sin,&quot; &quot;The Fight fo Mansoul,&quot; and &quot;A Reply to Address of Symmachus.&quot;	2001-11-28

His works are the best continuous account during these times and are chiefly important for the information they provide concerning the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, and the Eutychian and Nestorian heresies; and they also contain priceless letters of bishops and popes, supplications to emperors, original documents and decrees, which are essential for acquiring knowledge for the events described above.  Evagrius' orthodoxy becomes strikingly apparent throughout his writings; his eagerness to repudiate heresy and uplift the decretals of the Holy Synod's bears witness to this.  Some interesting stories of saints and miracles are preserved here as well, along with the first known record of the Holy Shroud of Turin.  Evagrius, as a source for secular events, is fairly reputable for the fact that he contributes much of his last two books to  the study its affairs.  As a historian, his enthusiastic spirit, often eloquent prose, and general accuracy for the events of his times, make him a conerstone to Church history, and an enduring figure in its two thousand year legacy.	2001-11-20

With this in mind, it would appear that Procopius' intimate relations with Belisarius, his wife Antonia, the Empress Theodora, and the Emperor Justinian, would keep his treatment of them within the bounds of believability, remaining free from both partialty and the general gossip of the times. Indeed, in certain aspects this is true; however, many times his hightened exaggerations seem a bit fictitious and superfluous. Procopius constantly hurls insults upon these Byzantine dignitaries as if he was the sole judge of their character; and he rarely ever has anything good to say about anybody or anything. In order to test the reliability of Procopius' &quot;Secret History,&quot; it must be compared with other chronicles of his time, which are quite scanty, and many times erroneous and misleading. Despite all this, it must be noted that the great Edward Gibbon, a fair judge himself, said that Procopius was &quot;the gravest historian of the times.&quot; The book is interesting, and at the same time a bit too personal. A wise suggestion would be to pick up his other works first; they will prove much more useful.	2001-11-18

It is a work brimming with insightful logic and religious lore; and it by far surpasses many works of its kind in the twentieth century...possibly since Augustine's &quot;City of God.&quot;  The book begins upon a paradox: a history of the prehistory of man.  Chesterton explains the very genesis of humankind as being strictly human.  He expounds upon man's earliest religions from the cave all the way to the Incarnation, which is the central theme to this work.  Chesterton also elaborates upon some of the prevalent heresies of the Early Church, shows how the Catholic Church was the church that Christ founded, and ends the book with captavating irony - the five deaths of the Faith...just look for yourself.

Montaigne's writings played a considerable role in setting the stage for later philosophers, like Descartes, to establish a new system of knowledge independent of the sense perception.

The main doctrinal treatises in this volume are the \\"Enchiridion\\"(handbook)and the \\"Holy Trinity.\\" The \\"Enchiridion\\" expounds the basics of Christianity to a learned Roman layman with a threefold division of faith, hope, and love. And the \\"Holy Trinity\\" is a work which Augustine devoted most of his time and effort to - besides the \\"City of God\\" - and is significant for its relation to the \\"filioque,\\" which says that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son - a doctrine which Eastern Orthodoxy does not accept.  The smaller portion of this volume contains Augustine's moral treatisies, which deal mostly with asceticism, marriage, and proper teaching. The only drawback to this volume is the translation, which first appeared in 1873; however, for the most part, it has kept with the times. All in all this is a pretty good collection of Augustine's works, and the Post-Nicene Fathers series is the only collection where you may obtain nearly all of his works.	2001-11-06

Though he did not know them, it cannot be doubted that the Jewish philosopher made a significant impact on the early Christian world.  He has been styled the first theologian on account of his hellenized Judaism, and for the fact that he espoused the concept of God's creating force - the Logos - as found in the Gospel of John, which was written nearly a half-century later.  Philo's works may be divided into two groups: works that deal directly with the biblical texts, and those that do not.  In the former works Philo links philosophy to the Pentateuch by the use of allegory, which uncovers how the Stoic concept of the Logos, and the Platonistic World of Forms are already present in the Old Testament; and in the later he describes the monastic order of the Therapeutae - mystics who claimed they saw the vision of God - the Essenes, and also defends the Jews against anti-Jewish acts by Gaius Caligula in an apologetic work &quot;Embassy to Gaius.&quot;  These works are a culmination of many divergent areas of thought; and to discover these works will be to discover the general milieu of Hellenistic ideas so pervasive in the Mediterranean world of the 1st century.	2001-11-05

To the Newly Baptized (fragment) (Loeb Classical Library)	Books	4	14	14	N	N	From the School of Alexandria	Clement of Alexandria was born tentatively in A.D. 150, and was more than likely raised a non-Christian; but he was destined nevertheless to become one the most influential teachers of the early Church.  Among his pupils were the sublime Origen and the Bishop of Jerusalem, Alexander.  Clement's mastery of Hellenistic philosophy, Greek mythological lore and the New and Old Testaments becomes strikingly apparent throughout his treatisies.  What will be found in this volume are three works: \\"Exhortation to the Greeks,\\" the \\"Rich Man's Salvation,\\" and a short catechetical address \\"To the Newly Baptized.\\"  All are full of a driving wit and a rhetorical polish common to the age.  In Clement we find the beginnings of that magnificent synthesis which began forming between the new emerging systemized Platonism and the pious speculations of the Alexandrian Church.  It must be noted that while Clement of Alexandria is duly revered among the Church Fathers, he is not recognized as one of her saints due to some views he espoused concerning Church orginization and for suspicions arising from some of his novel teachings, which we find resurfacing in his famed pupil Origen.  One must keep in mind, though, that the Church was not yet a fully organized unit, even though it was drastically moving toward that stage at that time.  Nor did she have a definitive and absolute system of theology to date, even though the apostle's creed is what made her universal, until the fully defined Nicene Creed settled the theology debate.  So it will be hard to condemn Clement if we take into consideration the historical context and the intellectual tendencies which thrived during his day.  One need not pass this little volume away; it holds some of the first masterpieces of nascent Christianity.	2001-11-03

Waite's work on the first two centuries of Christianity is a rare find - there is only five-hundred in print - and his unique scrutiny of study makes this work a broadening and rewarding read.  The perspective of this work is definately more objective than dogmatic; and it is more a careful documentary of raw facts than it is a panorama of historical changes. This book was printed in the early twentieth century, but on many points Waite's scholarship has endured, and still continues to influence the way we look at the formation of Christianity in the first two centuries. There seems to be no exact agenda or theme to this work, except for Waite's apparent intention to furnish aspects of the early Christian age divorced from the common traditions and doctrines of the Church. It will be a simple task to mold an individual conception of Christianity during the &quot;Apostolic Age&quot; with this book; but it is also a matter of individual conscience to decide whether that is a good thing or not. Overall this &quot;history&quot; will posit a significant amount of information that will not be found elsewhere.

It is an epitome of the entire age in general, rather than a mere focus on particulars.  One third of the book lapses before a singal mention of Martin Luther is made, but this is certainly not a flaw, Durant just shows how calls to reform happened centuries before him.  Most histories simply focus on Luther, Calvin, and Henry the 8th, and fail to cover the whole age of the Reformation.  This is not the case here. Durant begins with the condition of the Roman Catholic Church during the Papal Schism, moves to Wycliffe, shifts to Huss, and merges them with Zwingli, Luther,etc.  Some forgivable digressions are made, but they end up serving their purpose well.  Will Durant, a Catholic, judges the full scope of the Reformation with impartialty, revealing the pro's and con's of both institutions with sagacity.

This book is complete,concise, and very time saving for busy students...highly recommended.	2001-10-04

These selections are but a mere fragment of Jerome's extant letters; the selections made provide us with important historical content, while at the same time manifesting the personality of the saint - his concern for people, rather than doctrine, is the focus of these letters.	2001-09-21

Durant's history is the most impressive out of any single volume concerning the roots of Roman civilization, its growth, granduer, and decline, its art, literature, law, religion, social, economical, domestic, military, and everyday living spirit. Durant displays the rise of Christianity as a battle between Caesar and Christ - a battle which Christ won. Durant shows how the Roman spirit lives inside of us one-thousand times a day, which is a further testimony to the eternal legacy of Rome.  This is an enduring consolidation of facts, scholarship, and Roman history in general...certainly a rewarding read.	2001-09-19

Misopogon (Loeb Classical Library No. 29)	Books	5	12	12	N	Y	&quot;A Collection of Genius, Wit, and Good History&quot;	Volume two of the Emperor Julian's works collects several orations and satires which exhibit the keen sense of Julian's Pagan convictions and sentiments while at the same time imparting historical facts that otherwise would have been forgotten. Julian is the primary source for our understanding of &quot;his&quot; Paganism so it gives us a great impression of the declining Pagan age in general; through his orations we find him admonishing his fellow pagan philosophers to imbib a more puritanical Paganism, he exhorts the Athenians to rededicate themselves and their cities to the gods of their forefathers, and as &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; we find him at last teaching to the priesthood the principles of correct priestly conduct. Julian's satires - the &quot;Misopogon&quot;(Beard-Hater), and the &quot;Caesars&quot; - are intelligently hilarious and even enlightening...altogether Julian's works are a monumental contribution to the prose of late antiquity.	2001-09-05

Brown also looks to the &quot;East Roman Empire&quot; where a more harmonized Christianity boldly sustained the invasions and dominion of the Muslims, and triumphantly struggled for orthodoxy under the Iconoclasts, Nestorians, and Monophysites to eventually convert the Russians, Bulgars, and Slavs.  This work is definately a one of a kind, and an interesting and contributing effort to explain the rise of Christendom.	2001-08-16

Important and detailed original documents, letters, and decrees from the emperors and bishops who attended the great councils of Nicaea, Chalcedon, etc. are accessible here for students and scholars alike in a pristine and comprehensive fashion.  Miracles and monks, the inroads of the Goths, the Persian war, the Church's rise to a spiritual and temporal order, the often harmful and sometimes bloody disputes of the Christian factions, and the deeds of bishops, emperors, and saints underline the indispensable worth of this history.  However, the magnificence of this work is not fully unscathed: there are a few aspects which confuse the lives of Gregory, Basil, and Athanasius; after the sixth book limited chronological errors are made; and the scope of this work is centered on the East and virtually ignorant of affairs in the West; but these are nearly invisible and are fully corrected by the in-depth commentary provided.  It seems that Socrates was the leading man between the two chroniclers...Sozomen apparently borrowed, or rather, stole directly from Socrates; so it is best to start with Socrates' account.  In general this work is a follow up of Eusebius' history, and begins with Constantine's conversion, and ends roughly arround the reigns of Theodosius the Great's degenerate sons.  An excellent addiditon to the Christian library.	2001-08-14

He is not unfamiliar to those who study the ancient world of late antiquity because of the priceless information he provides and the fact that he is one of the few to actually encounter and document facts as they occurred either through personal experience or by the testimonies of his contemporaries.  Ammianus was a Greek by descent yet born in Syria, and later became somewhat of an influence in the Roman military.  His account of the incursions with the barbarians and persians is very detailed, elaborate, and laced with irony - traits that the great historians were all accustomed to.  Ammianus' treatment of the Caesar's: Gallus, Constantius, Julian, Jovian, Valentinian, and Valen's is fair and nearly free from partialty - there is speculation as to whether or not he came in contact with any of the Caesar's.  He was a pagan and of course an admirer of the pagan Emperor Julian - this left an impression upon the great historian Edward Gibbon whose prose and sentiments complement Ammianus' in so many fashions.  Ammianus never penetrates into the intestinal matters of ecclesiastical affairs, but only mentions Christianity a few times, and this is practically free from bias.  Overall as a source to gain a better understanding of the later Roman world with its valiant emperors, frequent internal disasters, military prowess and defeat, and decaying social strata in general, Ammianus Marcellinus' history is the most reliable...the value of this history must not be underestimated.	2001-06-28

Other biographers are a bit more anachronistic in dealing with More's world and end up conjuring a sixteenth century &quot;they&quot; understand instead...Akroyd is far from this.  Akroyd gives a vivid account of More's surroundings - his schools, were he lived, the churches and charter houses he frequented, and Catholic England in general.  This doesn't suprise me since Akroyd is a Londoner himself.  He also paints a wonderful picture of the piety pre-reformation England was akin to and describes the &quot;common faith&quot; all Londoner's held without trying to stigmatize anything and everything possible as other authors who write their histories out a reformation lense tend to do.  So I found a More properly placed in his time and surroundings free from unecessary predjudice and critical pomp with a certain twist that surfaces More's personality and conscience in an age of importance and transition.	2001-06-26

Saunders abridged edition of the &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; enhances the already elucidating and comprehensive full volume set sketched by Gibbon, and adds a precise tone to make this edition a quick and fulfilling read.  At proscribed intervals throughout this work, Saunders summarizes portions of Gibbon's original volume, and successfully renders a &quot;magnum opus&quot; accessible for busy students and readers in general.  The latter half of Gibbon's original work - after the sack of Rome - is composed of excerpts deemed necessary for a better understanding of the Empire's condition after the fall; and consists of: the age of Justinian, the rise of Islam, the fall of Constantinople, the ruins of Rome, and Gibbon's conclusion to the work as a whole.  The breadth of this work brims with irony and a captivating charm that pervasively treats the vicissitudes of the Roman Empire with a witty candor.  This is a timeless classic and a must have for anyone intersted in late Roman and Christian antiquity.  It took a bit of courage on my part to give this excellent book four stars, but a few things must be considered.  First of all, Gibbon wrote this history through a reformation lense and shamelessly exhibits his sentiments towards a history that was strictly catholic.  Constantine is looked at with disregard and even indiffernce, while latter Julian the Apostate - the enemy of Christianity - is praised for his intelligence and valor.  Hardly something I would expect from a christian historian.  Also, as I said earlier, this edition is made accessible for busy students and readers; not historians and scholars.  So for those who wish for a more in-depth and comprehensive approach to Gibbon's work, I would suggest the whole set.  But for anyone who wishes to find a precise edition with all the essentials, undoubtedly Dero A. Saunders is the best.	2001-05-21

In a sense this book shouldn't really be considered a &quot;history&quot; due to Kung's one-sided and totally impartial approach to reveal the Church's short-comings as a result of its own ideological failures.  Kung never acknowledges the Church's abiltity and authority to exercise sound decisions pertaining to political and ecclesiosocial matters except for the segment on Pope John-23rd and Vatican-2; and this luadatory measure is of course is short lived.  He also never entertains the idea that the Church's immovable solidarity concerning present-day morals is due to the fact that present-day morals are at the &quot;summa&quot; of decay.  Kung obviously doesn't think it's necessary to show the dark side of society; instead he enjoys showing the Church's.  It's a wonder why his authority to teach within the Church was revoked? However, in the face of all the unecessary critical pomp, there lies a whole lot of historical truth.  Kung just doesn't apply it in an equitable fashion.  This book is recommended for individuals with a keen sense of history, and is not a recommended first read for those beginning church history, or for those inquiring into the catholic faith.  Instead, I suggest Thomas Bokenkotter's &quot;Concise History of the Catholic Church.&quot;  It is a definite recommendation for people of all convictions.	2001-05-17

Arnold begins with a comprehensive introduction to shed light upon the social aspects of church society contrasted with its remarkable spread throughout the Pagan world.  In other words, Arnold does a good job describing the initial steps of primative Christianity that would eventually leed to the well-structured and ecclesiastical institution that has prevailed to this very day.  The testimonies recorded of these champions of faith, are composed with skill, and fit the criteria for which they were purposed in this work and in their time.  Unfortunately, early christians didn't write that much, so we are indebted to work with what has existed from either oral tradition or scholarly manuscripts.  There are no 'real' drawbacks to this work except the fact that the actual testimonies are few and emanate only from the scholarly retinue of the sencond century.  Overall, this book gets four stars; the benefits range from quick reference to quotes(etc.), and to a broad spectrum of the personality and character of the early church itself.	2001-05-02

Augustine necessitated nearly all the creedal professions and beliefs of the Nicene Fathers with an uncanny brievity.  As intended, then, for an educated Roman layman, the &quot;Enchiridion,&quot; now, raises interest in those who come in contact with it today.<br />The three-fold division of faith, hope and love, at times, seems a bit obscure and difficult to detect.  In other words, I had some trouble identifying Augustine's thesis as a whole(as the translators did also).  However, this was mearly a work that was quickly thrown together(Augustine makes this apparent at the opening),and is to be highly respected for its in-depth learning.  I doubt that Augustine intened his &quot;handbook&quot; to become some sort of &quot;magnum opus&quot;...it's strictly a handbook.<br />Augustine also deals with grace, original sin, repentance, and predestination with a scholars lore.  This work conveys an image of Augustine's thought in relation to the Orthodox beliefs of Christianity then and now, and continues to stand as not his greatest, but yet, one of his most unique works.	2001-04-24

Hall compressed nearly five hundred years of Church history and doctrine into a small but definitive volume that's very readable and thorough.  The up-to-date scholarship sheds new light upon several questions that have gathered dust over the years.  From Nero's onslaught of the primative Church, to Leo's &quot;Tome&quot; and subsequent edicts of Chalcedon, Hall's consistency and brilliance stabilizes the vicissitudes of the churches struggle to rise to the summit of Orthodoxy.  Through the Theological dissent and schismatic atmosphere of the &quot;Arian Contreversy&quot;, to the new era of Monastism and settled popular piety, I found Hall's representation to far surpass others in getting down to the nitty-gritty of Church Doctrine and History.  Hall's characterization manifests a picturesque quality of each individual that impacted the Early Church.  From Tertullian, Irenaeus, Clement, and Ignatius, to Augustine, Jerome and the Cappadocian Brothers, I found once again precision and composure that's unparrelled when compared with other works.

A gentleman caught between the priesthood and matrimony.  A scholar who spent myriads of time defending the faith he held to be sacred and unchangeable.<br />He also portrays Thomas More as a lawman with a particular zeal for purging away heresy.  A nobleman raised to the hieghts of loyalism, and to the depths of imprisionment.  A martyr who chose the sword as a symbol of pure faith to the Roman Church.<br />Richard Marius' exhaustive research reflects his genius in encapsulating history.  He does an excellent job of filling the gaps and obscurities that linger around the life and times of Thomas More.  I found this book to be consistent, in-depth, and highly informative.  This book is pleasent to read, and never hits any dull or bumpy spots.  Highly recommended; I also recommend Marius' biograhpy on Martin Luther, &quot;A Christian Between God and Death.&quot;	2001-03-28

This book acts many times as a supplement to the bible in filling important gaps that biblical history failed to provide.<br />The benefits of this work are inumerable and unweighable when contrasted with the abundance of historical resources and the give-away price offered.<br />The &quot;New Complete Works of Josephus&quot; Translated by William Whiston and the commentary by Paul L.

I found no self-proposed inclinations towards any position that Marius held in relation to Luther, but rather, saw a lucid potrait of a sixteenth century reformer caught in the midst of a corrupt world burning to make the truth of the gospel known.<br />In paying no homage to either the Catholics or Luther, you as the reader will be left to formulate your own ideals concerning the case for Christian Europe.  This I find to be a respectable trait in a biographer since many times the truth of history is left in scrupples due to egocentric bias rubb-offs.  Marius does not confuse history with  opinionative-literature, like many have often done before.  He simply makes the facts known, and when the sources are meager and minutely reliable, he uses the analysis of others to compile a sound explanation for the blank spots history leaves us at times.<br />Overall I was very impressed with Marius' exhaustive research, which reveals the mysterious, incessantly tempermental, and paradoxical man who faced all the odds at all ends;the man Martin Luther.  After reading this I felt compelled to purchase &quot;The Life of Thomas More,&quot; by Richard Marius, which I am now enjoying whole-heartedly.	2001-03-12

He did so in a fashion that reflects not only the inevitable scandles of the Caesars, but also, Suetonius depicts the softer side of these notorius rulers.  Amidst all the vice that enveloped the lives of the \\"Twelve Caesars\\", Suetonius showed that there still remained a remnant of clemency within the confines of their ruthless souls.  I enjoyed the fact that these stories were not at all one-sided, but manifested the ups and downs with a colorful continuity.<br /><br />The profiles of their countance and stature are described as well, which convey a more picturesque feel while reading.  However, most all of their profiles lie at the end of each book, after their deaths are finally announced, so I would encourage anyone who reads this book to become familiar with the posterior attributes of each individual Caeser. It will prove very beneficial in familiarizing yourself with the character at hand.<br /><br />All in all I was impressed with the work of Seutonius.  The vivid and ammusing accounts that he portrayed brightened my understanding of these fortunante yet not so lucky Roman Emperors (For Christians who seek this work as a possible reference to early Christianity, I must make mention that in only three instances is the religion mentioned and it is only labled as a mischievious sect second to that of the Jews).  So this book is very helpful and defintive tool to the life and times of the \\"Twelve Caesars\\", and it must be highly recommended to anyone interested in history or good old Latin literature.	2001-02-23

Another point of interest is the section on definitions, which is a dictionary of 185 important philosophical terms that developed throughout the Socratic era.

In this section, Timothy Ware discusses the principles behind Orthodox Liturgy, the Sacraments, and God's relations with the individuals that constitute the invisible body of the Church.  As a reader I discovered the the little things that engendered big friction between the East and the West.  Also I found valuable information about the rise of communist Russia, the internal and external dissent between Orthodox Churches during this period, and the prevalence of a faith that has remained nearly unchanged throughout the ups and downs of its long history.<br />So I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Church History, or for someone who simply wishes to look at the Orthodox Church from the pen of an Orthodox writter.	2001-02-09

Anselm quotes from (Psalms 14:1) which says that &quot;the fool hath said in his heart, there is no God&quot;.  So to Anselm the one who does not believe is the one who will never gain understanding, and to the believer, he says that, &quot;they set straight the path to all wisdom and understanding.&quot;  Thus, an incomprehensible Being, reveals what he wills to the ones who seek Him diligently.  This is the scope of his work in rudiments, but Anselm expounds with clarity on each and every subject at hand that he works with.  So as the reader you never feel that you are getting to little, or to much information.  Also you will invariably receive new insights (which is the bread and butter of the Ontological Argument)no matter how well read and learned you are on the subject.<br />The introduction to this book proves itself to be invaluable by summarizing the basic philosophy of Anselm.  It also contains refutations and defenses to the Ontological Argument by some of the most reknowed philosophers of all time such as Kant, Hegel, Locke, Spinoza, and Descartes', to name a few.  This way you can gain a better perspective of the way you will deal with the subject matter will reading.  Despite reading a few of these counter-arguments I found that none of them could add to, or take away from the sheer purity of Anslem's argument.<br />Deemed as the second Augustine , Anselm kept an extreme adherrence to the Holy Sriptures, the edicts promulgated by the Nicene Fathers, and an emphasis rooted deeply in the power of pure reason, which rightly has acredited him such an honorable  title.<br />So I would strongly suggest purchasing this book.  It has been a rewarding and valuable asset to have on my shelf and I hope it makes its way to yours.m kept an extreme adherrence to the Holy Sriptures, the edicts promulgated by the Nicene Fathers, and an emphasis rooted deeply in the power of pure reason, which rightly has acredited him such an honorable  title.<br />So I would strongly suggest purchasing this book.

Certainly, the editors and contributers of this translation achieved what was necessary for producing such an excellent Bible.<br />The foreward proves itself very welcoming by concisely exerting the main features as a helpful tool in studying the Word of God.  The preface explains the history of the NKJV, the precision and accurracy of the translation, the devotional style for the reader,  and the general format for the Old and New Tesaments as a whole.<br />Some aspects that will be beneficial and enjoyable while reading this Bible are the in-depth prolouges that describe who the author was, when it was wrote, and for what purpose the author served in writting the book.  On top of all of this are finely arranged outlines and timelines to further your aquiantance with the general themes of that particular time in antiquity.  There are 350 words held equivocal in this translation, so the scholars  provived a section for these terms and called it 'word focus.'  The words are discussed with regard to the context in which they are used, and their meanings and biblical usage are explained wonderfully.  Also the scholarly commentary, the vast array of maps, pictures, charts, graphs, and cross-references add all the more radiance to this edition.  To cap it off, there lies in the back a subject index to the annotations and special features provided in this Bible.  Following that I found the Concordance and colorful maps in the back to further add prestige to the Nelson Study Bible.<br />So for the overall quality of this Bible I would highly recommend  this work to anyone who wishes to grasp ahold of a great study bible.  For the evangelist, pastor, and lay person alike, the Nelson Study Bible will be a tool to refine yourself as a Christian, and to bring those who are less familiar with the faith to reconciliation with God.yourself as a Christian, and to bring those who are less familiar with the faith to reconciliation with God.	2001-01-17

Like any modern philosophical textbook, its contents are strictly modern and very little attention is paid to the ancient Greek/Hellenistic tradition or to the Medieval/Renaissance tradition.  As an introductory guide, shouldn't students become well-acquainted with the origins of Philosophy?  Nonetheless, brief lip-service is rendered to the progenitors of western thought; and this might suffice for anyone not deeply concerned with Classical/Medieval/Renaissance philosophy.  Now the textual apparatus includes detailed and well organized chapters, with pithy quotes from renowned philosophers, from both the Occidental and Oriental traditions.  On top of all of this, on nearly every page lies colorful, and many times humourous cartoons, that relate to humanity and man's quest for wisdom.  At the end of every chapter are detailed biographies of the many philosophers who have left their mark upon the world thought.  At the end rests an intricate and definitive glossary, which proves very useful while studying this text.  Overall, this textbook is a fantastic primer for Modern/Contemporary philosophy, while it nearly disregards the twenty-three hundred years of thought that formed it.	2001-01-05

The contents of this book includes twelve great thinkers, within the span of two-hundred and fifty years, and their ideals of the world around them.<br />The author has selected these individuals due to the diversity of their philisophical world-views.  Just look at the likes of Rene`  Descartes in comparison with the eccentricity of Mr. Friedrich Nietzsche.  One of course, would see that these two are extreme contraries, thus engendering an induction of pure thought from these contrary opinions, which in turn you as the reader may attain new insights resulting in a possible thesis or anti-thesis of your own.  Then their are those who share simalar ideas such as Kant, Hegel, and Descsartes.  They all hold that innate thought is to be venerated as the sole good of the world.  Whereas an Empericist or Materialist would rather adhere to the product of nature to find the meaning of this chaotic earth.  Any way you look at it all of their views are to be reverred and worthy of thought.<br />With the absence of a few great philosophers of that period, I was left just a little dissapointed, but the intuitiveness and profoundity of this work has left me invigorated.

Bokenkotter begins with the history of Jesus, explaining of all the factual aspects we know to be true about His actual life.  Then Thomas proceeds to expound upon the sources of data in which  constituted the contents of the four gospels.  Next, he journeys into the time of our church fathers (I especially favored the chapters dedicated to Augustine and Jerome).  He tells of the Nicene, and Anti-Nicene Creeds, and just how they impacted the doctrines of today.  Then Bokenkotter does a fine job of sifting through all of the strife, heretical conflicts, and persecutions of that time and conglomerates a clear picture of antiquity.<br />Later in this work, as the church's roots were settled, Thomas then related the relationship of church and state.  He does this throughout the rest of the book with no confusion or digression from the subject-matter whatsoever.  I found that to be very impressive, seeing as the vicissitudes of those relations engendered a plethora of variations in the church's history.<br />Finally, Bokenkotter elaborates on the movements that proved detrimental to the church's prominence.  Of course, he explains the Protestant movement, the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; of the seveteenth century, and some issues that the church is dealing with today.  Although, through all of the turmoil of that time he never plays the pessimist, but rather acredits many great things that occurred to keep the church's well-being in stable condition.  I found it to be very respectable to coincide the &quot;ups and the downs&quot; of the history in such a prudential manner.<br />Overall I found an abundance of useful information, and never found myself left uninterested.  So I would suggest this book to anyone who wishes to expand their knowledge of our church's long history and providence on this earth.knowledge of our church's long history and providence on this earth.	2000-10-17

Boethius was among the many commentators and compilers of his age who endeavored to preserve the tenets of Greek Philosophy.  His commentaries on the original Greek texts of Aristotle helped to pave the way for Aquinas' &quot;Summa Theologia.&quot;  So Boethius' works, though lacking originality, nevertheless made a very significant impact upon the later scholastic philosophers, and to the whole of Catholic tradition as well.  Italy, during Boethius' time, was under the rule of Theoderic the Ostrogoth, who unjustly imprisoned the statesman/philosopher, falsely accussing him of treason.  While waiting for his execution, Boethius wrote his &quot;Consolation of Philosophy.&quot; The book itself is among the masterpieces of all time, and the only thing as tradgic as Boethius' untimely death is the fact that we were not able to obtain anymore works from this genius with the golden pen.  Had he remained alive, it is very likely that we would have seen a sublime synthesis, in Latin, of Plato and Aristotle, not contradicting each other but complimenting one another.  However, in short, this book is a small manifestation of what may have happened if he lived longer.  What is interesting about this book is that it handles several different perspectives, namely that of the sorrowful Boethius and the consoling wisdom of Lady Philosophy, written both in eloquent prose and dazzling verse, which together ultimately culminates into a one of the most moving, inspiring, and thought provoking philosophical works of all time. The book is indefatigable, in that it never seems to quit opening new corridors of thought; and it is essential, because it is the philosopher's ideal breviary.  It is interesting to note - and this is certainly not a negation to his Christian convictions - that while this Saint was awaiting his execution he remebered Athens, not Calvary..	2000-09-29

Although Strathern does not reflect on the concepts and work of Plato to an extent of understanding his actual Philosophy, but he rather briefly gives quotes and hints as to provide a basic overview of his outlook on the world in general.  If Strathern was in fact to give a more comprehensive account of the ideas and work of Plato the whole point of compacting Plato's life into a &quot;90 minute&quot; book would be gone.  I myself had a very minute understanding of the man Plato.  But from reading this book I found a lot of useful information that broadened my knowledge of the life and times of Plato.  In reading this book you will meet some people that changed Plato's life, aswell as the treasured wisdom Plato handed to many individuals and to the whole of society.  So for the amount of time it takes to read the book in contrast with the valuable information accessible, I give this book four stars.	2000-09-25

The way  that he has interwoven his thoughts, feelings, and personal experiences  with the humble eloquence of repentance will have you as the reader very  exuberant.  In reading this work you will learn more of Augustine's life,  the spiritual turmoil he faced, and how he came to knowledge of the truth  in a most triumphant manner.  Although, that's not all that you will find  interesting in the Confessions.  In fact once Augustine converts to  Catholicism and discovers the mystery of the faith, he then proceeds to  fill in the blanks philisophically were he had once been left in error.  Finally Augustine ponders on the book of Genesis and discourses a  respectable point of view on the creation of heaven and earth.  Oh Yeah! I  forgot to explain how Augustine corresponds the subject matter of this book  with a profound emphasis on the Holy Scriptures.  So I recommend this  masterpiece to anyo ne who has a love for great Latin literature, or to all  that wish to read the prestige of Christian writings.	2000-09-06

Augustine  begins with a refutation of pagan worship, thus proving the ignorance that  reflected in their system of delusive beliefs.  Later on in this work he  explains many prophecies that were fulfilled in relation to Christ and the  Church.  After laying a sound foundation based on scriptural facts and  Theological truths, he then incorporates a splendid picture of heaven and  hell along with the resurrection of the body adjoined in felicity with the  spirit for eternity with God the Father.	2000-07-20

US	49494754	RO4NX8BD3F90C	0140445358	514751038	The History of the Church: From Christ to Constantine (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	24	27	N	N	An Early Christian Work of Vast Importance	Eusebius Pamphilius [AD 260-339], the prolific and learned Bishop of Caesarea, has left us the first piece of early Christian historiography, which is a kind of follow up to the sacred history meted out in the NT books.  The work itself is of vast and enduring importance.  For much valuable information regarding exceedingly influential figures like Origen and Constantine would have certainly been lost if this volume would not have survived to passage of time.  Other key facets of this work are:(1) Eusebius' admirable effort to catalogue the vicissitudes of Apostolic Succession (2) his devotion to exposing the multifarious heretical sects of the infant Church (3) his detailed accounts of the great persections and martyrdoms (4) and his provision of secular and imperial historical data in addition to the sacred.  Eusebius' natural ability for rhetorical flare and his proficiency as a chronicler, make this late-classic/early christian work a highly compelling and informative read.  This will be an outstanding place to start for anyone desiring to begin researching Christianity after the time of the Apostles proper.	2000-04-03
