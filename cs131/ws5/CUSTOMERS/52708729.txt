The most used word I here spoken today by many teenagers and many adults for that matter, is the word boring. I would be a millionaire if I could get a dollar every time I hear high school students use that word. We have  become a society where we are bringing up our children on TV shows like  90210, movies like &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;, and cartoon  shows like &quot;South Park&quot;. The philosophy has become, &quot;Hey,  I'm bored, what are you going to do about it?&quot; A classic book like The  Great Gatsby is just too advanced for many people.	1999-09-12

I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn  and get bored too easily if &quot;forced&quot; to read a classic book like  Great Expectations. Many high school students would rather be doing  something else than reading so it doesn't surprise me when I see all the  reviews by teenagers who said they hated the book. I recommend that they  read it again in 20 years after seeing the world.	1999-09-12

In looking over the reviews that people have written, I have seen the word boring being used quite often when describing a book including this one. What is most  upsetting is that it is often stated by high school students. Why do we  continue to require high school students to read books that are obviously  over their heads? Not all teenagers fit into this category, but when we  raise our children on mega doses of television, and bombard them with  advertising, what do we expect? Reviewing books is such a subjective task,  and everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, the word boring says  more about the person using it than the book being reviewed. Read The  Adventures of Tom Sawyer with an open mind, come up with YOUR OWN opinion,  like it, dislike it, but please don't use the word boring.	1999-09-12

Philip McGraw helps one understand  that unless you get out of that victim mentality, life will never get  better. It has to do with real life strategies to help one change their  life for the better. Many won't like what he says because it is easier to  stay in a comfort zone than to go out and take risks.
