The standouts this year:  Steve Rasnic Tem's &quot;Heat&quot; and Elizabeth Birmingham's &quot;Falling Away&quot;.  Excellent stories, both.  Low points: &quot;Welcome&quot;, by Michael Marshall Smith -- well meaning, but awkwardly written; &quot;The Pathos of the Genre&quot;, by Douglas E Winter -- a rather condescending essay about the state of horror writing and publishing, aimed at writers; and, &quot;The Beast&quot; and &quot;The Hedge&quot; by Bill Lewis [poetry is always Datlow and Windling's weakest point.. though this is probably a reflection of the state of poetry in general].  Terri Windling's Recommended Top 20 books in fantasy is an indespensable guide, as always.<br />Complete listing of included authors and works:  &quot;Darkrose and Diamond&quot; - Ursula K LeGuin; &quot;The Chop Girl&quot; - Ian R MacLeod; &quot;The Girl Detective&quot; - Kelly Link; &quot;The Transformation&quot; - N Scott Momaday; &quot;Carabosse&quot; - Delia Sherman; &quot;Harlequin Valentine&quot; - Neil Gaiman; &quot;Toad&quot; - Patricia A McKillip; &quot;Washed in the River&quot; - Beckian Fritz Goldberg; &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; - Robert Girardi; &quot;Heat&quot; - Steve Rasnic Tem; &quot;The Wedding at Esperanza&quot; - Linnet Taylor; &quot;Redescending&quot; - Ursula K LeGuin; &quot;You Don't Have to Be Mad...&quot; - Kim Newman; &quot;The Paper-thin Garden&quot; - Thomas Wharton; &quot;The Anatomy of a Mermaid&quot; - Mary Sharratt; &quot;The Grammarian's Five Daughters&quot; - Eleanor Arnason; &quot;The Tree is My Hat&quot; - Gene Wolfe; &quot;Welcome&quot; - Michael Marshall Smith; &quot;The Pathos of the Genre&quot; - Douglas E Winter; &quot;Shatsi&quot; - Peter Crowther; &quot;Keepsakes and Treasures: A Love Story&quot; - Neil Gaiman; &quot;What You Make It&quot; - Michael Marshall Smith; &quot;The Parwat Ruby&quot; - Delia Sherman; &quot;Odysseus Old&quot; - Geoffrey Brock; &quot;The Smell of Deer&quot; - Kent Meyers; &quot;Chorion and the Pleiades&quot;; &quot;Crosley&quot; - Elizabeth Engstrom; &quot;Naming the Dead&quot; - Paul J McAuley; &quot;The Stork-men&quot; - Juan Goytisolo; &quot;The Disappearance of Elaine Coleman&quot; - Steven Millhauser; &quot;White&quot; - Tim Lebbon; &quot;Dear Floods of her Hair&quot; - James Sallis; &quot;Mrs. Santa Decides to Move to Florida&quot; - April Selley; &quot;Tanuki&quot; - Jan Hodgman; &quot;At Reparata&quot; - Jeffrey Ford; &quot;Skin So Green and Fine&quot; - Wendy Wheeler; &quot;Old Merlin Dancing on the Sands of Time&quot; - Jane Yolen; &quot;Sailing the Painted Ocean&quot; - Denise Lee; &quot;Grandmother&quot; - Laurence Snydal; &quot;Small Song&quot; - Gary A Braunbeck; &quot;The Emperor's Old Bones&quot; - Gemma Files; &quot;The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse&quot; - Susanna Clarke; &quot;Halloween Street&quot; - Steve Rasnic Tem; &quot;The Kiss&quot; - Tia V Travis; &quot;The Beast&quot; - Bill Lewis; &quot;The Hedge&quot; - Bill Lewis; &quot;Pixel Pixies&quot; - Charles deLint; &quot;Falling Away&quot; - Elizabeth Birmingham.- Delia Sherman; &quot;Odysseus Old&quot; - Geoffrey Brock; &quot;The Smell of Deer&quot; - Kent Meyers; &quot;Chorion and the Pleiades&quot;; &quot;Crosley&quot; - Elizabeth Engstrom; &quot;Naming the Dead&quot; - Paul J McAuley; &quot;The Stork-men&quot; - Juan Goytisolo; &quot;The Disappearance of Elaine Coleman&quot; - Steven Millhauser; &quot;White&quot; - Tim Lebbon; &quot;Dear Floods of her Hair&quot; - James Sallis; &quot;Mrs. Santa Decides to Move to Florida&quot; - April Selley; &quot;Tanuki&quot; - Jan Hodgman; &quot;At Reparata&quot; - Jeffrey Ford; &quot;Skin So Green and Fine&quot; - Wendy Wheeler; &quot;Old Merlin Dancing on the Sands of Time&quot; - Jane Yolen; &quot;Sailing the Painted Ocean&quot; - Denise Lee; &quot;Grandmother&quot; - Laurence Snydal; &quot;Small Song&quot; - Gary A Braunbeck; &quot;The Emperor's Old Bones&quot; - Gemma Files; &quot;The Duke of Wellington Misplaces His Horse&quot; - Susanna Clarke; &quot;Halloween Street&quot; - Steve Rasnic Tem; &quot;The Kiss&quot; - Tia V Travis; &quot;The Beast&quot; - Bill Lewis; &quot;The Hedge&quot; - Bill Lewis; &quot;Pixel Pixies&quot; - Charles deLint; &quot;Falling Away&quot; - Elizabeth Birmingham.	2001-02-02

I found this book to be by far the more entertaining of the three, and the better written.  The characterisation is delightful, though some plot elements toward the end seemed rushed and merely tacked on to give the book it's shape.. as if Tarr had created her characters first, and her plot was merely secondary -- something I felt even more keenly in the next two books.  As Alfred leaves his cloister to send an urgent message to the King's Bishop, he discovers the world, and struggles to find his place in it.  Highly recommended to fans of Lisa Goldstein and Gael Baudino, et al.	2001-01-05

Alfred begins to reconcile body and mind, and continues to grow as a person, while questioning his own and his Kinsmen's part in his religion.  After reading The Isle of Glass, I found the Golden Horn something of a disappointment.  Everything about it seemed rushed, unfinished.  The writing is only a little better than average for a fantasy novel, and I craved more of the rich characterization and dialogue that I found in the first book.  Still, entertaining enough.	2001-01-05
US	51207378	R20G4OEB4821JY	0812556054	306131057	The Hounds of God (The Hound and Falcon Trilogy, Volume 3)	Books	3	3	4	N	N	entertaining, if sometimes tiring, fantasy	In the third and final book of Tarr's trilogy, The Hounds of God [c. 1223], Alfred, priest and elf, runs afoul of the Paulines and their Inquisitors.  He continues to question his place in the world and his religion as he becomes even less human.  Look for the cameo by [not yet Saint] Francis of Assissi.  My complaint about the previous book holds true to this one as well: rushed, unfinished, and not precisely ill-thought-out.  I suppose I've never found the main love interest very convincing, but that could be simply personal taste and not any lack of characterization on Tarr's part.  Also, by this time, I was completely tired of all repetition in the text and in the characters [how many times must one gape, or fall to their knees in exhaustion?].  There's also something about describing psychic powers in action that's become cliche', and I think one has to be an incredibly good writer to pull it off without sounding silly.  I was ready for it all to end, though when it came it was more touching than I expected.  Entertaining, if a little tiresome at times.	2001-01-05

Her language is beautiful and the story well-crafted.  I can't say how many times I've been frustrated with other writers who try to write &quot;prettily&quot; without giving a story, ideas, or emotion; I compare them to Renault, and they all fall embarrassingly short.  Her heroes are strong, human, and have a real sense of honor; you can see her already thinking of Alexander, whom her Theseus resembles &quot;in his precocious competence, gift of leadership, and romantic sense of destiny.&quot;<br />I wonder at the other readers who weren't able to empathize or care for any of the characters, but to each his own taste, I suppose.  I can see where the style and language of the story might be off-putting: it's different, and has a rhythm of its own which takes getting used to.  Where others find it to be &quot;cooly intellectualized&quot;, I find it speaks to me, and I'm drawn in.	2000-11-29

An archaeologist travels around the world, snapping photographs of &quot;real&quot; faeries: bright, slick, colorful photos of beautiful girls and young women in wings and paint, and not much more.  Like I said, the photos are a real treat, but I wouldn't bother with any of the superfluous and unimpressive text: it attempts the whimsy of Brian Froud's faerie manuals, without any of the wry humor and irony that make his books fun to read.  As a consequence, it seems to appeal to those readers who like to gush about &quot;believing&quot; in &quot;real faeries&quot;.  I do hope that they realize that this book is fantasy, not a field guide.  <br />For those interested in seeing more of her work...	2000-11-22

I wasn't entirely impressed.  There wasn't enough whimsy for my taste, and I found the travails of the Baudelaire children not amusing but truly *depressing*.  One horrible thing after another happens to the children, and it's really not as amusing or as charming as you'd think.  As Mr. &quot;Snicket&quot; says, in the opening line of the book, &quot;If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book.&quot;  And he's not kidding.  Another reviewer remarked on the similarity of this book to the part in Harry Potter where he lives under the stairs &quot;before the happy bit&quot;.  I have to disagree.  That was a good kind of melancholy - this is just plain awful.  I also found the vocabulary lessons on every other page to be irritating.  It was almost cute the first couple of times, but after a while, you just want to bludgeon Mr. &quot;Snicket&quot; to death with a dictionary.  I also couldn't figure out if this book was intended for children or for adults.  If it was written for children, I might question Mr. Snicket's taste - most of the adults are grotesque pedophilic monsters who constantly leer and drool over the children.  Is he writing these books as proscribed therapy as a sex-offender?  If it was written for adults, it comes off entirely too condescending and simple.  Still, it has a certain.. je ne sais quoi.  I would recommend that most people borrow this first book from a friend or the library before deciding to buy the series.  However, if you are a truly mean-spirited, black-hearted, lecherous, leering villain, I recommend you run out and buy them all today: this series was made for you!	2000-11-14

I felt like I was sleepwalking through her &quot;prose opera&quot; [as another reviewer rather saccharinely put it].  I didn't care about any of her characters, because she never gave me the chance.  While they were whisping somnabulently through the vague and self-consciously pretty prose, I was just trying hard not to fall asleep.  The sad thing is, none of her writing really wowwed me; had she spent more time on craft and less on art, she could have given us a good yarn, instead of a big yawn.<br />There are many who are going to just eat this up: it has a vague artificiality that many people seem to love.  I, however, didn't even think it was worth my time to finish.  Terri Windling, in the Year's Best Fantasy and Horror for 1998 [jointly edited with Ellen Datlow] recommended this as one of the top 20 &quot;must read&quot; books for that year.  Some of you are going to read this no matter what I say for just that reason: I ignored the poor and ambiguous reviews given here and read it anyway.  I have to say, though, that while her recommendations are an excellent guide, she's not infallible [or maybe there was just a real lack of good fiction in the fantasy genre that year].	2000-11-09

She continues with her familiar themes: the flexibility of human love and sexual attraction, and the necessity of force to bring and maintain peace.  It's as competently written as the other two, though the pacing seems much slower [and it could be that I simply wasn't as interested in the story].  I'm not sorry I read it, but I don't think I'll ever re-read it.<br />A note: It's not necessary to read the first two books to understand this one; all of them can be read out-of-turn.	2000-11-07

As to the criticism that Schiller chose to leave many things out of his encyclopedia: any other 320 page encylopedia on pop culture that spanned fifty years would be much the same.  As Schiller says himself in the Introduction, &quot;The book could easily have contained twice as many articles, but I tried to put more emphasis on depth than breadth of coverage ...&quot;  I feel I now have a better understanding of Japanese 20th century pop culture, not just of the quirky, fringe, or subcultural elements that happen to make their way to other countries or have a large presence on the internet.	2000-10-27

What's particularly telling is that he mentions several times that he had previously been a &quot;sucker&quot; for numerous pseudoscientific claims, new age nonsense, and the like.  He describes his change to skepticism as occuring suddenly, on a single day in 1983.  Whether or not this is &quot;artistic license&quot;, I couldn't say, but it certainly didn't encourage me to think highly of his capacity for logical thinking.  It seems to me that he has simply exchanged other faiths for a new one: Science [as much as he protests that science isn't a subject but a method; it certainly should be only a method, but is unfortunately deified by many -- apparently Shemer included].<br />The book should more appropriately be titled &quot;Weird Things People Believe&quot;, since there is very little information about the psychological, historical, sociological and socio-economic factors that cause or facilitate the belief or need for religion, myth/fairy tale, urban legend, etc.  In fact, he seems more to gloat over his imagined intellectually superior position than to offer any useful information -- and in the case of Holocaust deniers, any actual evidence.  He produces no references [though he does include a bibliography], and leans heavily on emotive words and a congratulatory &quot;aren't you so smart not to believe this bunk?&quot; attitude.<br />I did enjoy several anecdotal passages, and the explanation of ESP and the law of averages was very educational.  His &quot;I Was Abducted By Aliens&quot; anecdote in particular is quite funny and certainly worth a read.  I find myself quite skeptical of many things, and having an interest in sociology I was hoping for something a little more scholarly and thought-out.  &quot;Why People Believe..&quot; just didn't deliver.  I quit reading about 2/3 the way through, after I decided the frustration I was experiencing and the lack of any real substance didn't warrant completion of the book.	2000-10-13

However, as I continued reading the story turned from interesting social commentary to something right out of an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel.  The story started to feel like an incomplete, immature rough draft, and was full of inconsistencies and holes.  Delany mentions in the preface that &quot;They Fly at Ciron&quot; is a re-worked version of one of his earliest stories.  It rather seems to me he should have worked on it a little bit more.  There's the skeleton of a good story, but it doesn't quite seem finished yet.  I gave up half-way through.	2000-10-10
US	51207378	R36DFZPKIQFC9G	0312867034	114418677	The Essential Bordertown (Borderlands)	Books	3	2	6	N	N	enjoyable teen fiction	Most of the short stories in this collection have been written for teens, and older readers might find many of the stories a little trying.<br />Bordertown is a shared universe created for those people young enough or naive enough to imagine that being a homeless, unwashed, aspiring Artist automatically makes someone interesting.  Nearly everyone in Bordertown, it seems, is a runaway, a musician, a member of the SCA, an elf, or [dear me] all of the above.  Still, the stories are fun, and most of them are readable.  &quot;Argentine&quot;, by Ellen Steiber, I thought the best of the bunch: a wonderful love and redemption story set in Bordertown's El Barrio.  Other notables include: &quot;How Shannaro Tolkinson Lost and Found His Heart&quot; by Felicity Savage, an amusing story that makes it known that B-Town and Faerie may not really be all they're cracked up to be; &quot;When the Bow Breaks&quot; by Steven Brust, which takes place not in Bordertown at all, but on the Mad River; and &quot;Rag&quot; by Caroline Stevermer, whose writing style quite reminded me of Tim Powers.  If you can't stomach any of the other stories, at least give those four a try.	2000-10-03

After reading  Sweetman's biography, I am now very much an admirer of Renault herself:  intelligent, talented, courageous and strong.  Once she wrote to a friend,  speaking about feminists and women in general [she had a lifelong distaste  for women, a point on which I now find myself differing]: &quot;..the truth  obviously is that [they] do seem to have, as men, some extra reserve of  neural strength, some capacity for sustained intensity and inner drive,  which women do not possess.

Maybe  someday I'll go back to the book and see what kind of wacky and  off-the-cuff espionage that dashing Duke is up to for the rest of the  story, but I doubt it.. maybe if I'm in the mood for a little Duke from  UNCLE, or a good chuckle..	2000-08-04

Their dialogues only start to shine when they stop talking about folktales, and  start talking about themselves, their daughters, mothers, and  grandmothers.<br />Stories are grouped into thirteen &quot;themes&quot;:  Cinderella, Good Girls/Bad Girls, Bad Seeds, Sex and..., Persephone, Really  Good Mothers, Hero Mothers, Grandmother, Rapunzel, Caring Daughters,  Mothers-in-Law, Snow White, and Mixed Messages.	2000-06-22

Good collection of stories, though there seems to be a bit more horror than usual, and the inclusion of a couple of stories in which I was hard-pressed to find any fantastic or horrific elements at all.  As usual,  the poetry selections are the weakest in the bunch, with the delightful  exception of Marisa de los Santos' &quot;Wiglaf&quot;.  My favorites from  this collection: &quot;That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in  French&quot; by Stephen King [I'm not a big King fan, but i was pleasantly  surprised by this excellent little tale]; &quot;The Faerie  Cony-catcher&quot; by Delia Sherman [its ending was not unexpected, but  delightful all the same]; and &quot;Cold&quot; by A.S. Byatt [typical  Byatt.  for those unaquainted with A.S. Byatt, I can only say.. beautiful].   Terri Windling's Fantasy Summation for 1998 is useful as always.<br />The  following is a complete listing of authors and their included works: Kelly  Link, &quot;Travels with the Snow Queen; Steve Duffy, &quot;Running  Dogs&quot;; Marisa de los Santos, &quot;Wiglaf&quot;; Susanna Clarke,  &quot;Mrs Mabb&quot;; Rick Kennett, &quot;Due West&quot;; Catharine Savage  Brosman, &quot;Kokopelli&quot;; Bruce Glassco, &quot;Taking Loup&quot;;  Sara Douglass, &quot;The Evil Within&quot;; Larry Fontenot, &quot;Wile E.

But many things, i suppose, can be forgiven as long as they are interesting.<br />Swordspoint is an nearly-dreadful story about young, attractive, wealthy, well-dressed, horrible people scheming, conniving, blackmailing and intriguing; all the while giving fabulous  parties and drinking hot coacoa.  yeek.  well, almost.  at first i wasn't  quite sure i was supposed to be rooting for anybody -- every character  seemed incredibly unpleasant.  but i eventually grew attached to a few of  them, and i imagine that's what made this read worthwhile -- it certainly  wasn't the writing!  awful, misplaced, hackneyed metaphors abound.  and the  sex scenes.. don't get me started.  it's like reading a really bad romance  novel.<br />overall, though, it was pleasant enough.  if you're interested in  reading a *good* fantasy/sf novel dealing with intrigue and politics,  though, i'd reccommend something by Valerie Freireich in her &quot;Polite  Harmony of Worlds&quot; universe.	2000-03-24

The story seems to have been influenced somewhat by LeGuin's &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, and perhaps Tolkien, but is different enough from either of those to be interesting in  its own right.  The writing is capable, but not superb; the story and  characters are what hooked me.  <br />Average, but enjoyable.	2000-03-15

There are some good stories though (some of them previously unpublished) --  LeGuin's &quot;Unchosen Love&quot;; Mary Rosenblum's &quot;The  Gardener&quot;; Pat Cadigan's &quot;She's Not There&quot;; Maureen F.  McHugh's funny and touching &quot;In The Air&quot;; and Michael Stanwick's  &quot;North of Diddy-Wah-Diddy&quot;, about a train ride to hell.	2000-03-15

Though  not as good as her first novel [ Becoming Human, to which Testament is an  unofficial &quot;sequel&quot; ], Freireich has a skill for plot that makes  all of her stories a real joy to read.	2000-02-12

Ugh.  If I'd had to read one more pointless description of a building, or read  any more of what can most generously be described as &quot;intuitive&quot;  dialogue, or listen to one more of the main character's purse-lipped,  prudish opinions, I'd have gone insane.  The &quot;characters&quot; are  pretty much interchangable props [Dean's idea of character development  apparently involves rattling off lists of their favorite books] who  blithely accept anything posited to them [ghosts? duh.. okay].  I managed  to stomach half of the book before I realised nothing was going to get any  better.  I picked it up on recommendation from the Alternative Sexualities  in SF and Fantasy [compiled online], but boy is this a real stinker.	2000-02-06

I bought the book because it was listed as  recommended in the Alternative Sexualities in Science Fiction and Fantasy  online compendium; and it was a good read, but Marlowe is something of a  minor character.. in fact, I'm not sure why he's in the book at all: any  character could have played his part [ though it did make for flavor and  fun reading ].	2000-01-20

Valerie Freireich is a lawyer as well as a writer, and  it shows in her skillful depictions of conspiracies, secrets, political  machinations, and diplomatic relations.  Something of a Pinocchio /  Frankenstein story set in a future where cloning and genetic manipulation  are realities, Becoming Human is an exploration into the nature of  humanity, loyalty, individuality, and love.  It's been quite a while since  I've enjoyed reading a SF novel so much as I've enjoyed this one.	2000-01-17

The Carnivorous Lamb unfolds itself like a particularly lovely, intricate, and satisfying dream.  Things that at first appear to be matter-of-fact reveal themselves to be larger metaphors for politics, philosophy, social  atmospheres, and religion, in prose both decadent and surreal.  At heart  this is a love story: love between brothers, literally and  figuratively.<br />One of my favorites. :)	1999-10-08

Gaiman and Pratchett don't fall into the trap, like most writers in this genre, of relying on [too many] bad jokes and puns to hold up their story.  The characters are enjoyable,  though some of end up being a little underdeveloped.  The story kind of  flops about a bit at the end; what it needed, i think, is just a bit more  time and care.  <br />All in all, though, rather enjoyable fluff.	1999-10-04
