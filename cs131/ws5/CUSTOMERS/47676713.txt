Its strength is it covers the basic knowledge essential to working in the Neuro ICU.  The chapter on Head Trauma is excellent and integrates knowledge on the polytrauma victim as well as the patient in multiorgan failure.  Unlike some other books, it does not describe Intensive Neurosurgery isolated in a vacuum.  It reads 1000pgs so it is a good first book to consult on the subject.  The specialist and researcher will need additional monographs and books such as Head Injury by Bullock and Reilly, Bullock's Monitoring in Neurotrauma, Neurochemical Monitoring ca: 1998, Advances in Brain Resuscitation by Siesjo which is an older book ca: 1993, and have a reference like Youman's and Batjer ready to look up some specifics on the Neurosurgical side of things.  Brian Andrews has written 3 books on neurosurgical intensive care including one on Peds Neuro ICU.  His are more concise and about 400 pgs.  You just have to pick up certain pearls of wisdom from each.  Layton's book is the place to start in my opinion and you cannot go wrong there.  Not much is mentioned on research with jugular venous oximetry and CO2 monitoring and microdialysis techniques.  Pressure waves are better described by Andrews books.  He takes a distinctly neurosurgical perspective on topics.	2005-10-10

He was a complex personality & figure.  Brief central ideas of his in the logic realm are set forward.  This book is very helpful to have if you are just beginning the study of Wittgenstein and his works.  Wittgenstein was a staunch intellectual with an introverted, torn personal background.  Initially from a well to do German family with plenty of money he later led life almost as a hermit becoming isolated and depressed much of the time.  He received some recognition from Bertrand Russell at Cambridge who promoted his Tractatus, helping him later to obtain a position at Cambridge as a Lecturer in Philosophy.  Because of unhappiness and personality differences he prematurely resigned that position in the UK.  He worked for a while in building and construction, as well as in architecture.  The sad news really is he did not receive the well deserved praise and success of his works. Nor did Wittgenstein become a successful academic in his lifetime.  Perhaps to put his work in perspective, one should have Russell's books, volume 1 of Principia Mathematica by Whitehead, and Frege's Introduction to Logic to begin to tackle the complex thought laced throughout Tractatus Logico Philosophicus.  On Certainty is useful to look at for Wittgenstein's viewpoints on propositions and truth.  This book is definitely helpful for the Philosophy student.	2005-09-06

There are over 300 chapters on topics from basic cellular neurophysiology, pediatric spine trauma, neuromuscular disorders, pathology of neurosurgical lesions, clinical pathophysiology, anesthetic and neuroICU drugs, basilar aneurysms, development and biomechanics of the spine, functional & stereotactic neurosurgery, OR electrophysiology, etc., etc., etc.  The publishers were very cheap in printing these nice volumes on poor quality paper.  For 850.00 USD it should have been printed on archival paper which does detract from the appeal of buying them.  Some of the chapter editors are very obscure individuals who do not have any expertise in what they are writing about.  Residents themselves have probably written many of the chapters under supervision from their bosses.  Operative approaches and techniques are covered but you will not get the same detail as in Operative Microneurosurgery atlases currently available.  The books are fun to look at if you are a neurophysiologist or clinician.  The chapters on trauma are sufficient, but are not detailed like other books: Head Injury by Bullock & Reilly or Head Trauma by Miller.  For research, this book will seldom be used unless you are in the clinical setting most of the time.  For academic neurosurgeons, like myself, the research tools in the books are almost nonexistent.  This book is meant to be a Neurosurgery Residency Program Text as a clinical reference.	2005-08-06

Highlights in my opinion were Frameless Stereotaxy, Acoustic Neuromas, Photodynamic Therapy for Brain Tumors, Perioperative Care, Lumbar Spine surgery, atlantoaxial approaches to the base of the occiput.  The only problem with the book is the very cheap paper that the publishers chose for printing it on.  Apuzzo's Brain Surgery: Complication Avoidance and Management is higher quality from the paper point of view and from the operative standpoint.  Apuzzo's book does not cover spine procedures however.  Therefore, you are going to need both of these high quality textbooks.	2005-08-06

The concept of Neuroeconomics as developed in the book Behavioral Game Theory by Colin Camerer is developed somewhat by Glimcher, but I think he realizes we are at the beginning of the role of uncertainty and probability in brain function.  Certainly digital EEGs and brain waves show randomness, even though Llinas and others claim that 40 Hz. is the frequency of binding.  I think there are going to be other binding frequencies as well.  Multielectrode arrays will allow us to look not only at frequency maps, but spatial, color, and other probability maps through redundancy and repetition of brain symbols in adjacent microanatomical regions of the brain, like in V1 in the primate.  Glimcher begins his glorious ride and tour through Neuroscience by describing its History: DesCartes, John Stuart Mill, Sherrington, and so on.  This book is written for the specialist and the novice; the writing style is simple and lucid.  Paul models probabilistically LIP neurons by looking at receptive field paradigms.  Near the end of the book, Glimcher ties everything together in a cohesive theory of Neuroeconomics.  This will prove to be a valid and interesting approach to neurophysiological function.  Another book to look at exploring similar issues is Probabilistic Models of the Brain by Rao.	2005-04-18

The book covers the minute details of cerebral ischemia mechanisms discussing glutamate excitotoxicity, calcium, IEG, c-fos, c-jun, hypothermia, LTP, LTD, spreading depression, steroids, free radicals and scavengers, ZN-SOD, NO and NO Synthase, and many other topics.  There are over 50 chapters, making this a comprehensive coverage.  The material is dated so that one must not rely on this book for everything.  Wolfgang Walz wrote a more recent volume entitled Cerebral Ischemia by Humana which is worth looking at.  Bo Siesjo and T. Wieloch are the editors so you know it is going to be good with excellent commentaries at the end of each chapter & section. Bo apparently moved from Lund so that contacting him could be difficult.	2005-04-16

Anyone doing research on that small area will find an enormous wealth of information here.  It is good as a reference text on cable equation derivations.

This text does not cover neuroanatomy or systems neurophysiology. That is probably a weakness for those students hoping to have a comprehensive review book such as Principles of Neural Science by Kandel & Schwartz. Strengths of the book include discussion of Hodgkin-Huxley equations, ion channel kinetics equations, entropy equations, pearls of wisdom related to different aquatic species, etc.  LTP and LTD are covered well.  Receptor physiology is discussed better in this book than any other with the exception of Handbook of Physiology Receptors Springer by Lowenstein.  Cortical neurophysiology is weak here.  If you had to choose between this book and other cellular neurophysiology books, you cannot go wrong with this one.  Cellular Biophysics: Electrical Phenomenon by Weiss and Foundations of Cellular Neurophysiology by Wu & Johnston are two others to look at that are more complex than Aidley's book.  It is a shame that David Aidley died in 2001 so that a 5th edition of this outstanding textbook will not be available.	2005-04-16

Word on the street is snatch it if you see a copy. Greenblatt et al. write a very interesting well illustrated comprehensive book on the History of Neurosurgery highlighting famous personalities in the field.  For a more recent rendition of the last 50 years go to Fifty Years in Neurosurgery by Barrow. It portrays the historical accuracies behind Egas Moniz usurping the Nobel Prize for Frontal Lobotomy.  It was a political decision and he apparently was the only neurosurgeon to have one the award in modern times.  I will keep this book in my library for a very long time.  It is well crafted in a green hardcover with ornate gold gilded artistry and lettering.  For 99 USD, I would say it is worth it.	2005-04-16

It is suitable for a pocket reference.  The text focuses carefully on neurosurgical management.  It does not have many color or black and white illustrations. You really would have liked to see more CTs and MRIs in the book.  Much of clinical neurosurgery involves fast and accurate radiological diagnosis. The book will not teach you any of that.  It is succinct with an easy reading style.  Kempe's Operative Neurosurgery or Fundamental Techniques in Operative Neurosurgery Thieme should also be used in the first neurosurgery rotation and more advanced books read as experience on the wards and in the OR is obtained.  Peter Black could serve a larger audience by writing a succinct Operative Neurosurgery volume for the medical student.  He did author Operative Neurosurgery, a large 2 Volume Set which unfortunately has gone out of print.  Good luck with it all.	2005-04-15

What it lacks in pictures, it makes up for in pearls of wisdom such as \\"elevated levels of calcium in cytosol results in multimeric transformation of proteins in mitochondrial outer membrane and formation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore MPTP.  MPTP allows abnormal concentrations of calcium in the mitochondrial matrix, disturbance of electron transport, formation of reactic oxygen species and activation of lipases, proteases and endonucleases, hence enhanced cell necrosis\\"  Also clinically, the TRISS Probability of Survival Formula: Ps = 1/(1 + e-b), where b = b0 +b1(RTS) + b2(ISS) +b3(Age Index).

Dietrich has authored another Springer book in 2005 called Hypothermia for Acute Brain Damage which is more research based and more uptodate.  The books are still quite different.

It compares and contrasts the different genetic models of epilepsy in addition to many other facets of the field.  It discusses the GABA ion channel model, aberrant synaptic neurobiology, rodent and primate models, pharmacology of agents inducing and treating the various syndromes.  I used this as helpful background to a Grant I wrote on the Strasbourg rat and absence epilepsy.  For 2005, the book still remains relevant and useful as a tool even though it was written several years ago.  Additional areas of exploration included kindling (chemical and electrical), neurotransmitter chemistry, the differences in the developing and immature brain.  It goes into c-fos, c-myb, c-jun and transcriptional regulation of the epileptic state.	2005-04-15

This is not easily digested and understood.  You have to read the book in sections to obtain the greatest insights.  The book is better on theory and the physics of synchronization processes.  The end of the book discusses the chance for a electrical defibrillator.  We are presently at a very preliminary stage of development even though a vagal nerve stimulator has been found effective in certain refractory cases of uncontrolled seizures.  This book firmly places Epilepsy as a dynamic illness with chaotic, often unpredictable characteristics and sets in motion ideas for a cortical integrated defibrillatory device.  Let's hope we innovate and obtain one soon for clinical trials.	2005-04-15

The second is the one this review is based upon.  The book discusses regulation, comparative physiology, psychophysics, timing, bioengineering, psychology, and perception to some extent. Carpenter covers the period 1930s-1985 and makes a good effort to be comprehensive in coverage.  I think the book functions best as a research tool and reference for the advanced postgraduate.  In my earlier review I indicated my frustration with it, but think that this is one amongst many books to study in oculomotor physiology.  The other one is Eye Movements MacMillan editors by Carpenter.  Grossberg wrote one which is out of print by now.  This is a tough field to tackle and this should be kept in mind when reading about it.  Principles of Neural Science has one chapter which gives a nice overview of the topic. This text is a decade out of date, but I thought a reasonable starting point to obtain a solid body of knowledge concerning oculomotor neurophysiology. For an expert who knows the field well already, this may be a good text. The writing style is convoluted and tedious to follow some of the time.  Roger Carpenter's Neurophysiology 4th ed. is very clearly and simply written.  This book is just not the same.  He is one of the world's foremost experts in the field and I expected more from him.  Instead I referred to Hung's Models of Oculomotor Control as well as Carpenter's edited Eye Movements.  These other two books were easier to read.  The present text assumes a vast acquaintance with oculomotor literature dating back to the late 1950's through the 1980s. Roger Carpenter should write another book on Oculomotor Physiology well before he retires to update the information in his other two books on the subject which are about 10 years dated.	2004-08-24

Calculus and probability theory are introduced at a basic level and the book progresses onto advanced concepts of statistical modeling.  It has an A to Z format which makes it useful for looking up topics easily.  The book starts out with fundamental techniques but explores complicated topics in greater detail toward the end of the single volume.  I really like it as an MPH Student interested in epidemiology and plan on using it alot more in my career.  Five Hundred dollars is alot, but probably worth it.  This book is possibly not an absolute necessity, but I am glad I purchased it when I did, in the first year of the MPH Program.	2004-08-24

It is one of the very best books available on operative technique for intracranial aneurysms and AVMs.  It highlights patient & head positioning, scalp flap design, step by step technique for anterior, middle, and posterior lesions, with beautiful artistic rendering of complex anatomy with landmarks.  The layer by layer exposure is diagramed well.  All the diagrams have succinct captions, which clarify major points and junctures of the operative plans.

There are a plethora of 'end of chapter' problems with derivations &amp; applications to solve. The book is going to be confusing and tedious, even for computationally trained neuroscientists. For me, this book is a reference only. The format is similar to Thomas Weiss' Cellular Biophysics 2 Volume Set.  There is too much on the Hodgkin-Huxley Model which is very important historically, but of less interest today than it was in the 1960s.

It's comprehensive and covers most of the topics. The physiology, neuroanatomy, psychology, and imaging (i.e. fMRI, EEG, VEPs) of Vision are covered.  There is a large section of 200 pages devoted exclusively to Visual Psychophysics. Very well respected authors contribute to these to volumes, giving it an international flavor.  The book is meant as a reference text.  There is a very extensive bibliography at the end of each chapter. It is a reference work so you can look up the chapter on MST (heading perception), V1 (primary visual cortex), MT (motion perception), ganglion cell recordings, retinal dark current & ion channels, illusions, and others.  It will go into good depth in most areas.  If you're in Vision Research, it is not enough, you will need more specialized books and journals (i.e. Machine Vision, Vision Research, Eye Movements).  The format reminds me of the journal format for Nature Reviews Neuroscience. You better believe I am going to keep it in my library.  The weakness of this set of books is that it does not cover Machine Vision, robotics, electronics, new technologies in vision, and it does not have an experimental methods section.  Once reading, it can overwhelm you, so write down a list of 2 topics to look up each time you set-up to read it.  This will easily be a standard reference for 7-10 years.	2004-06-10

Ullman looks at both reductionist &amp; holist views of Vision, i.e. bottom-up processing, and top-down processing.  There are many equations and formulae spread throughout the text.  Great book for the serious Vision physiologist.	2004-06-10

Carpenter has illustrations reinforcing the major points and concepts of functional neurophysiology.  His expertise in Oculomotor Anatomy & Electrophysiology is a strength of this title, making the chapters on Motor Control, and Vision very well done indeed. Roger has end of chapter sections on the History of Neurophysiology with descriptions of key historical figures who have made a contribution to the field, chiefly from the English tradition, i.e. a European approach.  Roger summarizes and paraphrases many interesting books on journal references with nice succinct commentaries at the end of each chapter as well. Dr. Carpenter has written an entire chapter on engineering concepts in neuroscience such as feedback control and how it applies to neural network theory.  The chapter on balance & postural control (the vestibular system) is excellent.  Neurophysiology reads like a student's textbook, but serves a wider purpose in my opinion.  The CDROM contains a full text version, has a brain atlas of structures, highlights many clever experiments with electrophysiological parameters, and so on.  The 4th edition of the book is longer by about 80-100 pages than the 1996 3rd edition.  The 5th edition should prove to be even longer and better.  This book is aimed for medical students in their first year, but will prove useful to the first year graduate student in a PhD Program.  To review the essentials is one of the tasks I do find myself doing on occasion by referring to Roger's lucid prose.  He makes you feel comfortable and at home with some of the global issues. Summing up Marr's computational view of the cerebellum succinctly and running Sir John Eccles functional modules and cross-talk into this text, makes it a good read.  For more advanced computational models, one should really also have Michael Arbib's Handbook of Brain and Neural Network Theory (2nd edition) on your desk at the same time.  He taught me albedo which is the visual quality of white light, not illuminance, a measure of brightness, i.e. intensity.	2004-06-10

You need to know advanced engineering mathematics & probability theory to be able to understand this book. Dayan & Abbott model primary visual cortical, MT, LIP, and Motor cortical neurons as single units, but also as populations (clusters) of firing cells. They discuss Bayes Theorem, probability theory as it applies to the brain, and parietal lobe function as well.  They derive all the equations associated with these models for the student so that more advanced parts of the book are comprehensible.  The book is not meant to be a general Neuroscience book, but rather a course book about neuronal modeling, computational neurobiology, and neural engineering.  It serves these three purposes well.  In my opinion, this is the best written account of neuron modeling out there for the graduate student and researcher.  Methods in Neuronal Modeling by Christof Koch is the other great book on this subject.  If you own these two books you should be able to advance in high level neural modelling.  There are numerous equations and formulae of interest throughout each chapter in these two volumes.  The price of 39.00 USD for the hardcover is really quite a bargain.	2004-06-10

Very well known chapter editors create a 'Scientific American-like' view of the Basic Neurosciences. This book is grossly inadequate if you want to pass medical and graduate school exams. It's like a &quot;candy-coated&quot; atlas of neuroscience. There are not many rigorous equations to learn in the book. For that you will need From Neuron to Brain or even a higher book such as Theoretical Neuroscience. The strength of this book is the beautiful color illustrations. Its weakness is that it does not cover &quot;hard-core&quot; electrophysiology. Ohm's Law and the cable theory of the squid giant axon are covered, but where is Heisenberg-James' Theory of the quantum vesicle exocytosis, 'HJ' Theory of the Mind, and Boolean algebra. No mention of these ideas. You would have to go to Sir John Eccles' The Self & Control of its Brain, as well as Henry Stapps Mind, Brain, & Quantum Mechanics for further expansion on such theories. Also, where is Bayes Theorem and a discussion of probabilistic Populations of Neurons. Entropy is not discussed. A useful reference is Information Theory & the Brain by Baddeley for this. Ballistic, and Biofeedback are not discussed. Refer to Roger Carpenters' Movements of the Eyes & Neurophysiology 4th ed. Magnetic Stimulation and fMRI are alluded to but not incorporated as valid tools in the study of the Nervous System. Alan Kingstone with UBC, Vancouver, Canada has written a good reference on this. I have not really used this book since graduate school. This text is a very good overview of Neuroscience ranging from cell biology of neurons, ion channel physiology, to Movement Control, to Cognition & Memory. Phenomena like LTP & LTD have their own individual chapters. I still own this book and will keep it as a nice reference even though I do not refer much to it in my daily work.	2004-06-10

Its well organized and written.  It is suitable as a reference &amp; text for those beginning and advancing to higher levels in Vision Science. The pictures, diagrams, graphs, charts, photos, and outlines are well placed and explained in the body of the text. Because Dr. Palmer is first a Neuropsychologist, the approach is more geared toward psychological mechanisms &amp; psychophysics. The emphasis is less on Biological Approaches to Visual Function. This &amp; Chalupa's 2 Volume Set should get novice to intermediate scientists going further in Vision Science!	2004-06-10

Plenty of theory & rigor here! Professor Koch, with CalTech, models single ion channel function, dendrite, dendrite tree function, cable theory, stocastic theories, integrate-fire model, the Poisson model, and discusses how single neurons work together inside the brain. It is worth owning both as a reference book and to use in the laboratory. Dr. Koch has written many other books, but I think this stands out as his best. Methods in Neuronal Modeling 2nd edition is also very good. Koch's writings are complementary, but are not redundant. One can read this book without a problem if you know Calculus.	2004-06-10

There are quite a few equations in the book, but the authors have written the text so well, that an advanced undergraduate or graduate student in the Neurosciences can understand it. One of my favorate sections discusses the Entropy of information, and the entropy of neural code patterns.  This concept will likely shape the future of many neurophysiological investigations.	2004-06-10

The book is mostly devoted to the evolution of the Hominid Brain and Skull.  There is a good discussion and overview of CNS neurophysiology.  This book is the main book to start with on the subject of Brain Evolution.  The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution goes into more detail on the Primate Brain.  The Encyclopedia should be used as a reference book alongside Eccles book. Eccles understanding of the nervous system was better than most other scientists at the time this book was written.  Falk wrote a book worth looking at.  Primate Brain Evolution is out of print, but can also complement the approaches in the other texts.	2004-04-08

Some of the contents of the book are speculative, but the insights portray what the evolution of neurosciences will be in the 1990s-2000s. Eccles deals with the neuronal physiology of the cortex, cerebellum, spinal cord, and brainstem. He goes beyond this to look at neuronal networks in detail. Synaptic plasticity, including LTP and LTD are discussed also. Our understanding of these phenomena has advanced since that time. Eccles then goes on to introduce World 1-World 3, his conceptual framework to describe the Mind and the Environment as complex Black Boxes. As such, the mind needs the brain activity to gain an aperture or window into the black box of the environment or surroundings. It is by neuronal activity and network activity spreading across the surface of the neocortex that a person becomes aware of what is in the black box of the environment itself. These separate worlds have two way communication with each other, allowing meaningful actions and thoughts to occur. Cortical modules are activated by other modules & subcortical command centers, resulting in brief, 5-100 msec., interspersed, & continuous activity, composing an active &quot;orchestra&quot; of responses. Towards the end of the book he discusses Neurophilosophy and reminds us of Sir Charles Sherrington's work, who was his supervisor at Cambridge University. Eccles was not a reductionist. He was more of a dualist who felt that the Mind was going to be far more complex than most Neuroscientists had thought at that time. Eccles could have very well let his laurels rest on motor neuron physiology, but he did not, thus naming the book appropriately, Facing Reality. Sir John had his own personal crises throughout his career which made him question the validity of his own workand the direction of the scientific field. This is one of the reasons why he was such a great innovator and prolific writer.	2004-04-08

Study Week, September 28 to October 4, 1964, of the Pontificia Academia Scientiarum; [papers and discussions]	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Consciousness is more than a state of awareness	This is a conference proceedings published in 1965.  Although the material contained is dated by now, the core and details show the superior command of the authors in understanding and explaining consiousness.  The reticular formation, the centromedian thalamus, the brainstem core, and the neocortex all have complex neuronal ensemble and single unit patterns of activity which the authors present lectures about and have enlightened discussions in panels contained at the end of each chapter.  Some of the participants include Wilder Penfield, who mapped the human cortex from 1930-1970 at the MNI in Montreal, Herbert Jasper an epilepsy specialist, Sir Edgar Adrian who defined the neural code and the action potential all or none response in the 1920s-1950s, and other distinguished neurophysiologists.  This book is very well written and a good starting point for anyone interested in the history of neuroscience or the study of sleep, epilepsy, and conscious states.	2004-04-08

He decided to turn the notes into a concise paperback book.  This is a paperback book by Sir John Eccles describing the early neuronal physiology of both sensory &amp; motor neurons, with a mention and discussion of interneurons.  There is a discussion of motoneuron loops involving muscle spindles.  The writing is largely predicated on Eccles own work and innovations on motor control and physiology.  This is the strongest aspect of the book.  He discusses the Hodgkin-Huxley Models, the action potential, EPSPs, IPSPs, and other aspects of cellular neurobiology.  His writing is dry in this book so the reader must sit down and read sections or blocks of the book at different times to obtain the full benefit.  The discussion of ionic fluxes and neural homeostasis is outstanding.  This is a very good book for students of neurobiology to own.	2004-04-08

This manual has several chapters focusing on the most up-to-date neurophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques used commonly and uncommonly. The book discusses the full gamut of techniques and how they are applied to hypotheses on neural function.  Fluorescent photolysis of caged neurotransmitters, optical imaging using laser scanning, multi-photon laser confocal microscopy, and fMRI are all covered in depth.  The best feature of this book is that it is written concisely with several pertinent references at the conclusion of each chapter for easy reference.  It does not deal directly with the fabrication and usage of intracellular recording pipettes which is adequately covered in books like R.D. Purves.	2001-09-21
