The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that the HIV story line should have been brought earlier in the book.	2005-01-23

This books picks-up three months after the first book as Tracey is still looking for love in the big city. As usual, Ms. Markham delivers sassy characters, who each should get their own book. Quick dialogue that holds the readers interest and makes them wanting for more.<br />This is a great book for any fan of &quot;Chick-lit&quot; and I hope in the future we get more of both Tracey and Wendy Markham.	2004-01-28

I have to admitt that I had never read a Christian Fiction book before I read &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; by Judith Pella. The main reason that I bought it was that it was set during World War 2. But after starting the book, I was very sorry that it me so long to read it. Ms. Pella is truly a great writer that is able bring the characters to life. She is also is able to show that during war-time faith is something that is needed for survival. This is a book that should not be missed and I look foward to read the other books in the &quot;Daughters of Fortune&quot; series!	2004-01-22

After reading the review in Romantic Times, I was looking forward to &quot;The Top Gun's Return&quot; by Kathleen Creighton. But after reading it I was a little disappointed. I found the actions of Tristan, the fighter pilot, that had be held captive in Iraq very belivible. He clearly was having many problems relating to coming home. But it was the actions of Jessi(main female character) that I didn't like. To me, she seem someone who was cold and was in fact not that interested that her husband was found alive. Also another reason that that I rated the book low, was the fact that &quot;The Top Gun's Return&quot; was already part of an on going series and I was missing something by not reading the other books in the series.	2004-01-19

This books starts right before Judgement Day though years of battling the Skynet. While this might have be good idea for the third teminator movie, it just didn't work well for this series. The writer left many details that would have explain the action of his characters. I believe that Mr. Stirling could have given the characters more emotions, like he did in the first two books. Also since the book had alot on jumping in the future, its clear that the reader lost alot that could have made the book better. As I said before, this have been better if it was a movie and not a book.	2004-01-10

As a fan of Chick-lit I knew that I really like &quot;Good in Bed&quot; and I did or maybe I should say that I enjoyed the first half of the book.  I don't know what it is with some of Chick-lit books there seem to a part of the story that is pure fanasty and you know that it could never happen in real life. In &quot;Good in Bed&quot; case its Cannie meeting famous actress and going to Hollywood. Why can't these writers, keep there storyline in the area of real life.	2003-04-09

I was very disappointed in this book. The first thing that really bug me was I don't think that Ms. Dunmore has ever been to Leningrad (now St. Petersburg).  When I read a book I like to be able to picture myself right the middle of the action and with this book I just couldn't. The second that I didn't like was the fact that I couldn't connect with any of the characters.  I believe that this is very important as a reader.<br />Overall, &quot;The Siege&quot; is a bad book.

One would think with Angela's history that she would might be scared of men. But no, she has a past that might make some men of the day blush. The love scenes did live up to the erotic genre.

The authors give us characters from every different social group and how the diaster effect them. The books is dated in some parts the reader is easiler able to over look this.

I was not 40 pages into the book, when I realized that Ryan (The main male character) was perfect. I mean he was rich, handsome, and the most understanding male on the whole planet. Ms Anderson seem to make light of the fact that Bethany(main female character) was in a wheelchair. We didn't see any deep emotions either of the two characters. In fact, at on point I did stop reading the book and the only reason that I went back to it, was I paid 6.99 for it.

It was an okay read, but Lili character seem a bit unbelievible to me. As a reader, I couldn't relate the character and I think that is important in order for the reader to enjoy a book. I read Her Bodyguard but its not a book that I will be keeping.	2002-09-01

By half way through the book, I have admitt that I was disappointed in the book.  The beginning started out well, but ending of the book seemed a bit unrealistic. Neither of the main characters ever showed deep emotions to the situration that brought them together. Also it seem that the writer wanted to end the book without finishing up the storyline. Overall, &quot;Those Baby Blues&quot; is a decent book if you are looking light read.	2002-08-14

I discoved Lilian Harry last summer, since that time I have read most of earlier works and I can say that her lastest release &quot;Girl called Thursday&quot; lives up to the author's great standards.  Ms. Harry takes the reader back to Portsmounth during the beginning of world war 2 and the tell the story of a young girl named Thursday, who has joined the VADs.  As with her other books Ms. Harry give the reader many details of both the setting and characters. Another great book by Lilian Harry.	2002-08-13
