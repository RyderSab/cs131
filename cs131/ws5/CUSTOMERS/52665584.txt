Walker Winslow, done by LangMarc Publishing, was insightful to me. I'm sure it will be to others as well. <br /> <br />Conrad, known as Connie to his friends and family, though born in Illinois came from a Scandinavian background. With a strong line of Norwegians in his family it is obvious that he came from that same bloodline. During his school years he played football and became a boxer. He fell in love with and married a very special woman-Ann. Eventually they had several children. Connie had entered Lutheran Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota and became a Lutheran minister. Then he \\"joined the Minnesota Army National Guard as a chaplain in the Viking Division.\\" He also became an active member with his local volunteer fire department. BUT he felt he had a higher calling! <br /> <br />Connie requested a switch to join the active Army and it was approved. He and his family were soon at Fort Campbell, Kentucky in September 1962. Being assigned to the 101st Airborne Division also meant Connie had to attend Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia to become jump qualified. He was soon known as the \\"Leapin' Deacon\\" paratrooper chaplain. <br /> <br />Shortly after the Gulf of Tonkin incident Connie was reassigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade. In April 1966 he was enroute to Bien Hoa, Vietnam with his new unit. During the course of the year he was in-country he made visits to the 93rd EVAC and the 3rd Surgical Hospital. He also came under fire several while traveling with or ministering to the troops and yes he was wounded at least once. He was also awarded the Silver Star. <br /> <br />With his combat tour over Connie's next assignment was at Ft Benning. Following that he was sent to Fort Hamilton, New York and that was followed by a tour in Thailand. From there he went to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1973 Connie was assigned to Fort Hood, Texas, then Carlisle Barracks in Pennsylvania. In 1978 he was off to Korea followed by Fort Sill, Oklahoma in 1980. Connie was then sent to Kaiserslauten, Germany with a brief stopover in Washington, DC. In 1987 Connie was stateside at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, TX. He retired from the Army in October 1990. <br /> <br />He took over as minister of the MacArthur Park Lutheran Church in San Antonio. He retired from the ministry in 1995. Connie and Ann now enjoy the simple life of retirees and have frequent visits of their children and grandchildren. <br /> <br />Throughout this book Connie interjects some of the people and incidents he encountered along his path. He certainly had an amazing career and he shows how his religious background and training helped him through it all. His strong background, his loving family by his side and their continued involvement in the church have all made an impact on their lives as well as the men and women they came to know. <br /> <br />If you served in any of the units that Connie ministered to you might want to read this book. If you didn't serve don't worry-you might still want to read this book. If you have, or even if you don't have, a religious background read this book-it is filled with spiritual passages throughout. It might just help you! <br />	2005-08-23

Carol Barkalow was raised about 25 miles from where I live. She became one of the first women to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1976 and graduate from there in 1980. <br /> <br />As I began reading \\"In The Men's House\\" I wondered how in depth Carol would go with the things I wanted to learn about West Point and her military career. <br /> <br />She wrote about Beast Barracks, the summer session held before classes actually began in the fall, I soon learned the terminology used for the four classes of cadets. The freshmen are called Plebes, sometimes referred to as Fourth Class men. As sophomores in their second year at the academy they were called Yearlings or Third Class. The third year at the academy is when the cadet is really in his/her second year which is called Cow. Their senior year, the last year they are at West Point, these young men and women are called a Firstie-go figure! <br /> <br />Carol wrote about her Reception Day and how \\"dehumanizing\\" it was. She covered how the new cadets were treated that day-the first time 119 women were allowed into West Point. At the end of her Plebe Year she looked forward to Recognition Day. This was when upperclassmen finally addressed them by their first names! <br /> <br />Carol wrote about her second summer's communications training along with Infantry-Recondo training. She wrote about the good and bad things that she experienced during that year as well as the remaining two years at West Point. <br /> <br />Her third summer she went south to Fort Benning, Georgia for Jump School. Carol wrote about the tower, the jumps and the cake presented to the female cadets from their lieutenant, which was marked \\"Congratulations Whiskeys\\" with the \\"W\\" meaning women. <br /> <br />By the time Carol entered her Firstie Year there were only sixty-two women left in her class out of the original \\"119 who entered, each of us had fought her own dragons.\\" In January 1980 the cadets chose their future branches. They were given two choices and then the assignments were based on academic rank. Carol requested Transportation Corp first then Air Defense Artillery. While her request was filled it was her second choice that she was assigned. By February she found out that following graduation she was headed for Germany. <br /> <br />Her first assignment was with Charlie Battery, 3rd Battalion, 71st Air Defense Artillery that was headquartered in Stuttgart, Germany. Carol stated that she \\"looked to her platoon sergeant...to be my teacher.\\" Some things don't change. <br /> <br />Her next duty station was Fort Lee, Virginia. She had requested a branch transfer from ADA to Transportation and received it. She was headed for the 57th Transportation Company. <br /> <br />Throughout her book Carol pointed out many things that affected her time in West Point, Germany and Virginia. She wrote of things that I knew nothing about so I learned from reading this book. She wrote of things that I had forgotten with time so it was nice to be reminded once again of my own service and some of the things I went through. <br /> <br />I have two wishes though. One that Carol had written a little more about her time at West Point. Also that she would write another book that shows her accomplishments since 1990. She is now a retired lieutenant colonel with a wonderful career behind her and that career should be in print! <br />	2005-07-08

It is actually written as letters between the author and her granddaughter Jennifer. It opens with Jennifer asking about a piece of jewelry she found in a jewelry box. Dorinda proceeded to write back about the \\"Remember Pearl Harbor\\" pin and what it stood for. She told Jennifer about the bombing on 7 December 1941 that she herself witnessed as a child. <br /> <br />She told Jennifer about Richard Fiske, a young Marine bugler, who was aboard the USS West Virginia that morning. As he was preparing to blow his bugle he spotted the planes coming towards the ships and saw the bombs dropping. He couldn't believe his eyes as his ship was struck along with so many others. He saw many sailors and Marines die before he was told to abandon ship. Richard soon hated the Japanese. <br /> <br />Dorinda also told Jennifer about one of the many Japanese pilots who flew on that mission. Zenji Abe was in the second wave of planes following orders to drop bombs on Pearl Harbor. He soon found himself being shot at by the Americans-something that didn't happen very much during the first wave. <br /> <br />This Hawaiian born and raised grandmother told her granddaughter about other things such as the role women played during this time of war, the events that took place in Hawaii following that terrible morning, how the war came to an end and so much more. <br /> <br />Jennifer was excited by the information Dorinda had shared. She told her schoolmates. But she wanted to know more about Richard and Zenji. <br /> <br />Dorinda wrote back telling her as much as she could about the two men from different sides of the world. She told Jennifer what they did with the rest of their lives and how they eventually became friends. Dorinda told her granddaughter that she would soon be receiving something special in the mail-and that she did. Jennifer got letters from both of these men. They wanted \\"to share their friendship story with the children of America and Japan.\\" <br /> <br />I think Dorinda did a marvelous job passing along this little history lesson to Jennifer and so many others who have read this book. <br />	2004-09-24

As a young girl living on the Pearl City Peninsula, also known as Pearl Harbor, the author witnessed the bombing on 7 December 1941. She could see the burning ships that were anchored near her family's home. She recalls all too well that horrible morning and the days, weeks and months that followed. She wanted to share her story with the world. She has managed to do just that and very well I might add. <br /> <br />The author wrote about hearing the planes coming in flying low-then her family heard the explosions. They went outside and watched the attack. The family got into their car and tried to get to a safer area. They stopped long enough to see the battleships burning-then they hid in the sugarcane fields. The military police found them hiding and told them they could not go home. Instead they were sent to the recreation hall of a sugar mill where many other families joined Dorinda's family. It was almost a week later before the families in the sugar mill were allowed back to their homes. Dorinda's parents found shrapnel and bullets embedded in their walls. \\"Pearl Harbor Child\\" made me stop and really think about other people on the islands and what they must have gone through. <br /> <br />She wrote about expecting another invasion by the Japanese. She was the beaches lined with barbed wire. Everyone had to be fingerprinted and carry identification. Food became scarce. Soldiers were everywhere with bayonets on their rifles. Everyone was issued gas masks. Money had to be exchanged. Blackouts and curfews were strictly enforced. Mail was censored. The Japanese-Americans and other foreigners were placed in internment camps. <br /> <br />So much more can be found in this incredible book written in a simple manner to help others understand a little of what the Hawaiian people went through during the war. I credit the author with doing an excellent job. I was very impressed with \\"Pearl Harbor Child.\\" This is truly a book for people of all agesto read! <br />	2004-09-21

As I read one portion of the book I could sense the love of one father for his children. Though Dennis had a loving relationship with his wife and three children everything seemed to fall apart at once. But through the author's wonderful pen he shows the reader just how this young man's life is altered. As I sat in a doctor's waiting room wiping my eyes reading the portion titled \\"The Three Shoeboxes\\" people around me wondered why I was weeping. This segment brought me to tears several times. It was written that well! <br /> <br />The next portion of the book took you from God's home to \\"Gooseberry Island\\" on earth and back. It was quite thought provoking to say the least! David came to find his one true love in Lindsey. Then came their child and more love. And my tears flowed once again. The faith of this couple and their child is tested beyond human belief. The author makes you wonder about your own faith and what lies ahead for each of us here on earth and in the thereafter. <br /> <br />As I stated before-I think this is Steven Manchester's best book so far and I've read several of his books. I hope he continues to write books of this caliber! <br />	2004-08-21

I thought I knew them all. Well, I was wrong! This woman was taken as a prisoner. But should we consider someone placed in jail as a POW?<br />This is a small book, which could be read in about an hour. The author states \\"This is not an autobiography...but an account of an incident that should not have happened to anyone.\\" And for that I have to agree.<br />Ms. Harrison, a singer, went to Vietnam in 1966 to entertain our troops with her husband's blessing. After singing in Japan and Hong Kong she was headed for Saigon. Her booking agent told her all the Do's and Don'ts of going in-country. She followed his instructions carefully.<br />The author described her first night in Vietnam comparing it to the 7.0 earthquake that hit the Los Angeles area in January 1994. She wrote about her first journey with a driver and five soldiers \\"riding shotgun\\" out of Saigon the next day to entertain soldiers.<br />In Saigon she stayed in a villa operated by George Albrecht, of the World Wide Talent Agency, with other entertainers. She did shows for the 3rd Field and 17th Field Hospitals. She also went to DaNang with only six more days left in Vietnam.<br />Her final show was for a group of officers who \\"were not as nice and polite as the enlisted men...rude, yelling, `Take it off.\\" Mildred \\"stopped the music and told them if they wanted a `stripper', they should have hired one.\\" That night the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the Army visited George's office and confiscated Mildred's \\"passport, plane ticket and health card\\" with no explanation. Her papers were returned to George the next morning.<br />On 26 December as Mildred began going through Customs she \\"was stopped and searched-everything, including all of my sheet music.\\" They took her passport. She demanded to know why. She could see a note on the Customs agent pad \\"that said to hold Mildred Harrison `as long as necessary'.\\" Her flight left with her luggage but not her.<br />She was detained and all she was told was \\"they had orders from higher up, meaning the CID, even though they had no jurisdiction over any civilian.\\" The Customs agent took her envelope with the checks from George and her original Travelers check in it. \\"We got something! She had money on her.\\" She \\"was interrogated for two more days\\" then allowed to return to the villa but she had no clothing. George helped her find an attorney who said, \\"Oh, no, no, not another American in trouble over your money.\\" She soon learned \\"Once you were arrested and the prosecutor got hold of your case, they just put you in prison `without a trial, a hearing, or arraignment.' And you could be there for up to five years, before your case even came up.\\"<br />\\"On the third day the attorney had taken me every place that he possibly could, but he could not get it settled. The prosecutor's office was last.\\" She soon found herself headed to the `Women's prison at TuDuc' until I went to trial.\\"<br />The author described the conditions at TuDuc: a large room, about two hundred women and some children, many were sick, a straw mat, the restroom area, the \\"very large RATS,\\" the food, and some of the women interned there. Many of those sick inmates had tuberculosis and they were all around her.<br />She was imprisoned at TuDuc for three days. After a lot of controversy she was released but she still couldn't leave the country. She returned to George's villa and good cooking. Three weeks later she still wanted to return home but still confined to the country without her papers.<br />\\"After the fifth day of February, the Customs agent came to the villa and brought my passport, with news the `charges and fines had been reduced'.\\" George took care of everything and finally she was on her way stateside.<br />Mildred Harrison received a lot of publicity about this event when it happened although I don't recall any of it. BUT due to that publicity other American's, being held in Vietnamese prisons, were also released. And yet she couldn't get booked on any shows upon her return to the USA. Several people attempted to investigate how this situation occurred but one by one they either died mysteriously or suddenly dropped their investigation.<br />Many questions arose. Why was she stopped and searched? What about that group of officers who were rude? Did they have something to do with it? Did the CID have anything to do with it? Why was she imprisoned? There has to be more to this story than Mildred shared in this book. I can only hope that she writes more or that someone else addresses this issue. Although she was not a POW in the strict sense of the word she was indeed imprisoned wrongfully in a country we were there helping to defend!hen it happened although I don't recall any of it.

Carey was trained as a combat medic and X-ray technician. He served in Vietnam March 1967 to May 1968. He wrote his book Vietnam Veterans' Homecoming: Crossing the Line as \\"a straightforward but diverse account of one man's post-war journey toward homecoming and healing.\\" AND it is just that!<br />This amazing book has not only helped Carey heal himself from the war but I believe it has helped other Vets who read it already. AND I think it will continue to help others in the future. I'd like to share some of Carey's passages with you so you can get a feel for what his book is like.<br />One that grabbed me actually made me think about all the people affected by one individuals life and death. \\"No one in Nam ever died alone. Someone always hurt for them....You don't know how many people loved him on his way home, or how many people mourned for him before you even knew he was dead. There are a lot more people in that coffin than you know.\\"<br />For those Vets who have not yet been able to find a way to make it back to their families in one way or another Carey wrote \\"we have made ourselves prisoners of Vietnam here and are locked in by an open door.\\" That's a profound statement.<br />He had memories of his family while he was in Vietnam and they came into his head at one point. He wrote \\"when I was small, my grandmother and mother would hold me when I was hurting and scared. It seemed to take the pain away....My grandmother and mother had put me in touch with my female side.\\" Carey tried to do the same thing for his patients in Vietnam but he realized that \\"my grandmother and mother did not make the pain go away. They absorbed it. By them holding or touching me...I was not alone.\\" While with his patients they \\"knew they were not alone. We took in so much pain. We hurt so much inside....There wasn't a patient that I touched who was not touched by the both of you [his grandmother andmother].\\"<br />Carey has found a way to express himself and help others as well as him on the road to recovery from the war. He wrote that \\"vets say, they live for their families....I haven't heard too many vets say they live with their families.\\" So in writing this profound book of statements and thoughts he is hopefully helping other Vets with their own emotions and feelings.<br />He knows all too well about PTSD. He wrote, \\"I just want to live life. So I will stay just a little bit outside of your normal life, so I can have some control.\\"<br />He realizes how families too are affected by the war and their loved ones serving. He commented \\"I want to tell you how much I am hurting but when I start to look into your eyes and see the fear, I don't want to hurt you, but I do want you to know that part of my life. I watch you shy away from me....I feel like I am in a glass bubble....I don't want to remain in here but the only way out for me is to talk about what I went through and let some of the pain out....Stay close to my bubble. As long as I can see you out there, I know there is a way out for me.\\" He knows he can reach out to someone for help as long as he can see them and this works for others as well.<br />One of the more important statements Carey made is \\"We are Missing in America (MIA). Maybe the next time we hug as vets, along with saying, `Welcome home,' we should add, `thanks for what you did then, and what you are trying to do now.' If we don't recognize what we have done over all of these years, no one else will.\\" Isn't it sad that the general public doesn't welcome home Vets the way we welcome home each other?<br />In the Prologue was written that Carey' book \\"delivers an honest treatment of the personal side of a controversial war. It provides people who have no military experience or knowledge with glimpses of military life during wartime, and inside views of the emotional struggles soldiers endure during their post-war lives.\\" That it does and more!AND I too look forward to Volume II.<br />This is a book for all to read. Perhaps then everyone can understand what at least one Vet has gone through in his life dealing with his wartime service to our country. This is a must read book and should be in Vet Centers, libraries and bookstores around the country.	2004-01-28

Boyd is an amazing yet heart-wrenching book. It chronicles the life of a family and their trials and tribulations of dealing with the after effects of the Vietnam War. The author began up front saying she didn't use her real name or one of her children's but that everything else in the book was \\"true as I remember.\\"<br />Having been previously married and with three children the author was surprised later on when she met her \\"true love\\" soldier. Once married they had three more children and the family blended well together.<br />The book begins with her new husband departing for Vietnam but then back tracks showing how Jack and Alicia met. Their first couple of duty stations together including a tour overseas. Then it was Jack's training for helicopters to get his wings and warrant officer bars. Shortly thereafter he received his orders \\"to report to the 1st Air Cavalry in Vietnam\\" in May 1966.<br />\\"The year seemed like an eternity.\\" The family waited daily for his letters. When they arrived they were light and airy not delving into what was really happening. Likewise Alicia didn't report everything happening at home to Jack either. The family watched the news every night and worried about his safety knowing his unit was flying in very dangerous conditions.<br />When Jack arrived back in The World was when their problems began. The man they knew before his tour of duty in Vietnam was not the same man who returned to them. \\"Alcohol became his protector from the awful memories.\\" At that time according to the author she \\"was aware of no counseling nor classes that the army offered to these returning soldiers or their families.\\" Although he was now assigned as an instructor pilot he drank more and more. He finally turned to civilian life instead of chancing having to return to Vietnam.<br />Thus Alicia, Jack and their family began their journey of moving from place to place. They both held various jobs in different places. While there were good times, there seemed to be more bad ones. There were times when they \\"had no money, no jobs and no work prospects.\\" Jack would go in and out of treatment programs. The children were affected, as was the marriage.<br />When really important things happened such as when one of their daughters was burned Jack was able to control himself and deal with the situations at hand. He finally got involved with the Post Traumatic Stress Clinic and that seemed to help-when he attended their sessions.<br />Throughout the book I kept waiting to read where Alicia and/or the children sought help for their own anguish. Unless I missed it, none of them ever went to an AL-ANON meeting. And while they weren't providing Jack with his alcohol they also didn't seem to be doing anything to make him stop other than take him to the VA Hospital occasionally.<br />This is a book that must be read. I know that many Veterans and their families have gone through similar events. AND sadly most everyone is too proud or afraid to ask for help. This family needed it. Had they gotten it right away perhaps their relationships wouldn't have fallen apart the way they did. I kept wishing that the author used her real name just because I know folks that might be able to help her and her family even now-years after the Vietnam War ended.	2004-01-28

I'm glad I had the opportunity to actually meet Pauline before I read her story. It's hard to believe she has had so much sorrow in her life and yet she keeps an upbeat attitude. This excellent book shows Pauline's struggle to deal with the loss of her husband, the birth of her child, her pain for more than 20 years and how she coped.    This book showed what this one woman went through and I'm sure so many others did too. BUT Pauline has had the courage to write about how Howard's life and death affected her and her child. It is a well-done book and should be read by everyone. I sincerely hope that it helps other widows heal also especially now that we have another generation of young widows among our population. Pauline should be proud of this book.	2004-01-28

Some of what she has shared in this book is her own feelings while other parts are those from some of the people she came to know while stationed at the 24th Evacuation Hospital in Long Binh, Vietnam.<br />Mary interviewed seven other individuals for A World of Hurt besides including her own personal stories of what it was like for her in-country and upon her return to the states. Stephanie Genthon Kilpatrick, John Miller, Frank Chamberlin, Son Dinh Nguyen, Chris Slavsky, Terry Corneil, Doug Powell and Mary shared so much in this interesting perspective 171-page book.<br />These individuals shared a lot with Mary who has now shared it with her readers. Their stories will amaze you as they all came from different lives as well as parts of the country. They all had feelings about the war before and after they served their country.<br />Retired Army Colonel David Hackworth wrote in his Foreword \\"Mary Reynolds Powell's powerful book is the perfect antidote to blow the revisionists out of the water-with the facts eloquently presented....Frequently...I found tears running down my face.\\" I could tell that he had read this book and was as deeply moved as I had been.<br />In 1965 Mary \\"marched in a New York City parade backing the war.\\" By 1969 she \\"wore a black armband in support of the national peace moratorium.\\" After being \\"a registered nurse for only twelve months\\" in 1970 Mary found herself in Vietnam at the 24th Evac with the US Army Nurse Corps.<br />Mary recalled her stopover in Hawaii enroute to Vietnam walking past a group of Marines headed stateside \\"staring into the oldest eyes we had ever seen....their eyes were ancient, their faces blank.\\" She quickly realized what she was getting into. She described her first night in-country as \\"Artillery hammered in the distance, mosquitoes feasted on me, and diarrhea induced by the malaria pills...kept me running to the latrine all night. Sleep came in brief, restless spurts.\\"<br />The hospital's chief nurse asked Mary where she would like to work. When Mary said that she had done most of her work in internal medicine the chief nurse said there was an opening there and she was to start right away. I think this is one of the first books I've read where the author then tells the reader everything you'd ever want to know about the 24th Evac including a map of the area. I found it most interesting.<br />One of the items she described was the amphitheater where shows were put on. She pointed out something I was well aware of already. The site was where the \\"annual Bob Hope Show\\" was put on every \\"Christmas afternoon....You want to know something? Bob Hope has never spent a night in Vietnam. He flies to Thailand after every show.\\" I'm so glad I wasn't the only one to point this fact out.<br />Mary explained the first day at Wards 7 &amp; 8. She wrote of her name being added to the DEROS chart \\"in Vietnam, Marines stayed for thirteen months while Army and Navy tours were twelve-`364 days and a wake-up.'\\" She now had \\"359 days left.\\" Mary took the time to describe several patients who stuck in her brain all these years. She also remembered \\"running...smiles....olive drab fatigues....endless IVs....gecko lizards....the proud, smiling face of a young soldier as I pin on the Purple Heart medal he earned with his body.\\"<br />Mary's wrote \\"As a nation, it is time for us to take the burden from the kids who fought our war. All of us were part of the lie that wasted an American generation and devastated an ancient culture half a world away. Until we acknowledge the wrong that we did in arrogance, we will not have learned. And if we have not learned, we will do it again.\\" And sadly I see that happening as I write this with our invasion of Iraq. I only pray our troops will come home quicker than they did when they were sent to Vietnam a generation ago.<br />This is a book well worth investing in. Mary's interweaving of stories and memories from her friends make it special. It should get more attention than it does but then again it's about an unpopular war and the people who served during it.	2004-01-28

They knew women had to be there but yet the media didn't cover them. So they went in search of them. People forget that women are also members of the fire, police and medical departments around the country. They didn't \\"want the women...to fade into the background of American History\\" nor \\"future generations of children...believing that only men are strong, brave and heroic.\\"<br />They interviewed women from the NYPD, FDNY, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department (PAPD), and other women who were there that fateful day and many days thereafter. Each chapter tells another woman's story so be prepared to read 30 gut-wrenching stories. They also interviewed women who were at the scene in other capacities. AND something very few people know about-three women died that day while in the service of saving others: Captain Kathy Mazza (PAPD), Moira Smith (NYPD), and Yamel Merino (EMT). There are chapters about those women as well.<br />These women and so many others saw crushed vehicles, dead bodies and body parts, along with airplane parts. They witnessed more in a short period of time then most people do in a lifetime. Some of their stories are very graphic while others brushed over that part. They talked about what they experienced and saw, their injuries, feelings and more. Its no wonder they continue to have problems BUT more importantly-most of them have all returned to the jobs they held on 11 September 2001. They continue to serve their community. They are all heroines and definitely role models for young girls to follow in years to come.<br />This is a book well worth reading though if you are like me it may take you awhile to get through it. I admit I had a hard time reading each chapter. With my background I felt everything these women went through without actually having been there. Be prepared for your own emotions to run the gamut. Be prepared to relive that day and the days that followed over again through these women's eyes. But take the time to read \\"Women At Ground Zero\\".	2003-07-10

John Burnam's \\"Dog Tags of Courage\\" is a must read book! It not only chronicles his service to our country but also shows just how these dogs impacted his life and the \\"approximately 10,000 war dog handlers and 4,000 war dogs\\" that served during the Vietnam War.<br />He described the different types of K-9 units used by all branches of the military. John wrote it in simple language that children could read and understand what he was saying. AND yet this book was intense at times.<br />John wrote that when dog handlers were wounded, killed or returned stateside that the dogs were turned over to new handlers. He explained also that the dogs were left behind when the war ended. Our government felt they were military surplus and expendable just like our men and women in uniform.<br />John wrote this so children could also read it and learn. One of the nice things I noticed was that he took the time to explain some of the equipment he carried or had to use while in the Army. Although you may see these things in the movies they are never really explained the way John did in his book. For example he explained what came in a box of C-rations as well as the \\"dark brown plastic bag full of goodies.\\"<br />He wrote of his own encounters with the enemy and explained various aspects of a battle. John explained how it felt while bombs were being dropped all around his unit. \\"The aircraft was so close, that we could see the pilot in the cockpit.\\" His writing made you feel like you were there with him.<br />After he was wounded John was sent to Okinawa where he operated forklifts and trucks until he noticed a \\"possible opportunity\\" working with sentry dogs. He was soon assigned to handle Hans. John explained their extensive training for this position. \\"Sentry dogs were trained that their primary functions were to guard and attack on command.\\" And they were guarding \\"a stockpile of chemical warfare weapons.\\" John wasn't completely satisfied. He had something calling him back to Vietnam.<br />He was headed for another infantry position but jumped at the opportunity to work with the dogs and soon was assigned to the 44th Infantry Platoon Scout Dogs. More training was in store for John. Scout \\"dogs alerted on things like booby traps, VC in foxholes, and even other animals.\\" He was first paired up with Timber who was \\"high strung, had a mean streak, and didn't like to be disciplined.\\" John and Timber trained on the obstacle course built for the dogs. \\"Dog training was all about repetition and consistency.\\"<br />John learned \\"to keep your eyes on the dog at all times. A dog's natural instinct will tell you what he smells, sees, and hears, and when danger is near.\\" John would have to learn to \\"translate his dog language into English.\\" When he and Timber were wounded though John recovered quickly \\"Timber didn't respond to commands....Timber wasn't going to be ready for any missions in the near future....Although he recovered physically, he never fully recovered mentally.\\"<br />John had to select another dog to work with. \\"I felt excited the first time I saw this dog, and he took to me as if we'd worked together before....Clipper responded to me as no other dog had.\\" He and Clipper became a team and began training together. Clipper could alert John at least \\"one hundred yards\\" from a decoy. John could only imagine how well he would do if the enemy were out there in the bush. \\"Clipper was like a walking radar beam. I learned to trust him more than my rifle.\\"<br />John and Clipper were soon out on patrols. Once again there was enemy contact. \\"Clipper raised his head and alerted up into the trees. I didn't give it a second thought, because there was too much activity all around us.\\" Later when John saw a dead VC \\"hanging from the tree....I remembered that...this was the tree that Clipper had alerted on....Clipper had sensed danger in that tree and he'd been right.\\"<br />John \\"found the scout dog business to be a never-ending learning experience.\\" On yet another patrol Clipper gave several alerts and began a zigzagging motion. Later John would learn that he was deliberately going around tripwires and booby traps. The lieutenant that John and Clipper were leading \\"knelt and gave Clipper a hug and told him what a great dog he was.\\"<br />As I read each and every page of this amazing book I could feel the love John had developed for his fellow soldiers and the dogs they each worked with. John knew that his time in Vietnam was coming to a close. By March of 1968 he would be going home. BUT he also knew that Clipper wouldn't be allowed to go with him. His heart began breaking when doctors told him that his knee would have to be operated on again, that he wouldn't be able to see Clipper or work with him any longer.<br />John's struggle to get back to Clipper became evident. \\"When Clipper recognized me, he went crazy....Words can't begin to describe the emotions that poured out of me for this dog. He was my best friend.\\" Clipper \\"was a real American hero, but he'd never get to go home and receive the hero's welcome he deserved.\\" Clipper and other scout dogs weren't allowed back in the US.<br />I've only scratched the surface of this wonderful book. You need to read it from cover to cover as I did. Be prepared to cry as you read it because it is written that well. My heart goes out to John, the dogs and all the other dog handlers that John introduced in this book. They all did an amazing job.	2003-03-08

Here's a book to round out your information. With heroes on every page, \\"Women At Risk\\" by Noonie Fortin, rolls out an engrossing panorama of brave women who have served their country faithfully, shedding their blood, giving their lives, using their talents, fighting beside and saving their fellows. Covering American history from before WW II to present day, chapter by chapter you meet these brave, resourceful women, including: Jean Hayes, following family tradition as she joined the Coast Guard in WW II; Laura Dunlop, cryptologist during the Korean War; Bernice Whiteside, volunteer Army nurse in Vietnam; Pam Waterston, an Army Heavy Equipment Operator serving in the Persian Gulf, watched, wished, hoped and prayed as she served with her fellow soldiers on ammunition guard duty at the Port of Al Jubayl.<br />Having given twenty-two years of service, Vietnam Era veteran, First Sergeant Noonie Fortin knows her subject intimately. Fortin interviewed each women personally before including them in this book. Written in simple, potent language, with appealing detail and many photographs, \\"Women At Risk\\", provides interesting reading for a wide age spread, middle school through adult. Libraries, schools and individuals will find it a useful reference book. Several practical appendices add to the convenience of this book: bibliography; listing of service organizations; roll call of women looking for military buddies; glossary; an exhaustive index; suggested activities for students.	2002-12-12

I've not found any book that gives such a detailed yet wide ranging picture of women in all branches of the United States military as this one does. I came to it with the mind-set of a WW II veteran, a woman who served in the Women's Army Corps attached to the Air Force. I was convinced our way was best-women living in a separate area with female officers, serving in limited jobs such as file clerks, stenographers, dental technicians, librarians, and postal clerks. We could say yes or no to overseas duty, and many of us stayed on the same military post the entire enlistment period. A common complaint was lack of promotions, and few of us had the opportunity to attend a training school. When six of us WACs qualified as airplane engine mechanics, many obstacles had to be overcome before we were allowed to work on the flight line, the first WACs in our service command to do so. We never handled weapons and did not teach males nor command them.<br />That is not true of the women who came after us, and how tame our lives seem in contrast. As this book shows, these later women were stationed around this country and all over the world as well as aboard ship. They were trained for a variety of jobs vital to our national security, attended many different schools, and attained high ranks. Among other subjects, they taught weaponry to male soldiers. Some of them served in more than one branch of the military. They've won many medals, ribbons, and awards. They've coped with problems we never dreamed of, at least at my airfield: discharges because of suspected lesbianism, rapes, sexual harassment, actual hatred for being a service woman, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Agent Orange.<br />Though Women At Risk gives a summary of women who served prior to 1945, the emphasis is on women who have served during peace and war after WWII. Those of us who preceded 1945 are credited with being pioneers, of paving the way for the women who served during Korea,Vietnam, Desert Storm. But I refuse the accolade. These young women sketched in Women At Risk are a different breed and I applaud them. They took control of their lives, their careers. They earned college degrees by correspondence courses, they studied for advancement in the service by correspondence courses. They served in Reserve units. Though some of them made mistakes, instead of meekly accepting the discharge decreed for them, they took action to correct their mistakes and insisted on being given a second chance. When the military reneged on promises made to them, did these women accept it? No! They either wrote their Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, or lodged a Congressional complaint. In either case, they got the justice due them.<br />Women At Risk provides a fascinating look at these take-charge women who speak with unusual frankness of their lives in the armed forces. It is a long book, but it is set up so that it can be kept within handy reach for reading when only a short span of time is available. Besides, these stories are so strong they are best-appreciated in small segments. I recommend Women At Risk to anyone who doubts the contributions of women in the military, and to everyone who is interested in women's history.<br />The book is indexed, and has a helpful glossary. The author, a veteran herself, works tirelessly for the welfare of veterans, but especially \\"the silent veterans\\" (women), and Gold Star Mothers...	2002-10-04

She wrote of how his father \\"based all his decisions about family matters and the family business solely on the return of his son\\" and that his mother \\"greeted every morning with thoughts of her son...embraced every night as one less they would be without him.\\" His sister \\"counted the days until she could finally share all the growing up she had done during his absence.\\"<br />She interviewed each family member and some of Dick's friends. She read the many written letters and listened to the tape recordings between Brenda and Dick. She pieced together all their lives to write this amazing story of love and devotion between two young people and the heartbreak that war brought to their entire families. She brought everything together magnificently!<br />Dick and Brenda's love grew from the first day they met in February 1965. From then on they were almost inseparable. Whenever they were apart they wrote, called or tape recorded messages to each other daily. They married in 1967. They vowed to stay together but the Vietnam War was about to separate them.<br />After being classified 1-A for the draft Dick joined the New Hampshire National Guard believing the Guard would never leave the state or at least not the country. But he was wrong.<br />Neither Dick nor Brenda believed in this undeclared war. He was at Fort Bragg undergoing field training in June 1968 when his son was born. He managed to get home for a week.<br />After learning his unit was in fact going to Vietnam he went back home for two weeks in August and spent countless hours holding Brenda and cradling the baby \\"then he was gone.\\"<br />By mid-September 1968 Dick was in Vietnam. For the next year hewrote letters home daily telling Brenda how he felt about the war, how much he missed her and Dickie and how he couldn't wait to return home.<br />On 25 August 1969 he wrote his last letter home \\"I cannot wait to wrap my arms around you....You are my life.\\" His unit was pulling out the next morning. Dick was going home. But it was not to be.<br />The Genest and Cavanuagh family helped Jami Janes with this book as a tribute to Dick Genest and to help Dickie learn more about his late father. It was also in many ways a healing tool for Brenda. This was indeed Brenda's story as much as it was Dick's and well worth the box of Kleenex to get through it.	2002-09-29

Some of it was excerpts from her daily diary. Some were letters that went back and forth between family and friends. But Aileen was able to weave them all together to make an interesting story of what it was like being in the Women's Army Corps during World War II.<br /> She started with a look at her birth home, family, jobs, and a desire to serve our country while in her early twenties. The Army almost didn't take her because she was underweight but on 3 February 1944 Private Aileen Kilgore was on her way from Palos, Alabama to Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia for Basic Training.<br /> Aileen made entries to her diary almost every day for the next month. She also found time to write letters home and to her friends. I wondered when she found time to write so much having been in the Army myself but perhaps it was our generation's differences.<br /> Her interactions with fellow and sister Veterans helped to make the book very interesting. The letters from her friends who were sent overseas helped to show the differences of the training and day to day life between being stateside and overseas. She showed how friendships here and there made the difference to these women and kept them going when they were ready to give up at times.<br /> Aileen included twenty-four photographs in the book and an Epilogue where she pointed out what became of some of the folks she met so long ago. I would recommend this book for students and adults of all ages. It should be part of our women's studies programs in colleges as well as our military history collections. And it should be included in gift shops of military/Veterans museum as well as on Army installations for all to see. Aileen Kilgore Henderson and the University of South Carolina Press should be proud of this book published in 2001.	2002-07-11

When Roy Benavidez entered the Army he had no idea what was to become of him for the rest of his life.<br />Roy's second war covers his time in the military. His training is explained in this book. His tours of duty are also explained. His courage under fire is really covered very well. He wasn't suppose to be on board a chopper when it went to rescue some fellow soldiers but he jumped on at the last minute to help in any way he could. He soon found himself embroiled in a battle for life--his life. <br />He was one of a very few survivors that fateful day. His struggle to live makes this book. BUT his third war was that of fighting the US Government for recognition of what he had done--and yet it wasn't he who was doing the fighting--it was those others who survived who wanted him honored. It took more than a decade but he finally received the Medal of Honor.<br />As a footnote to this review--a ship was named for him and christened on 21 July 2001. The USNS Roy P Benavidez will no doubt see action in a war just like its namesake.	2002-07-11

It's not often that I pick up a book about something other than the Vietnam War but I'm so glad I did. The Unexpected Storm: The Gulf War Legacy by Steven Manchester is amazing! It's not that the war was amazing but rather the way the author has depicted it and perhaps amazing is still not the right word to use.<br />     As I opened Chapter One for the first time Steve was talking about being onboard the C-5A Galaxy plane that was taking his National Guard unit off to the Middle East. He wrote candidly of his feelings toward the war and his fellow soldiers. He was open and honest throughout the entire book.<br />     This was the first time the American public watched as members of the National Guard and various Reserve units around the United States were being deployed along with their active duty counterpart troops to serve their country. No it's not the first time units of that nature were deployed but this time was different. Everything was aired on television and the country quickly became aware of the sacrifices our men and women in uniform were making. Many were leaving spouses, children and jobs behind. In some instances both parents of children were being deployed and their children were being left with grandparents or other family members.<br />     Steven's group was no different. Many members of his Military Police (MP) Company from Massachusetts were married and had families. Throughout the chapters he reflected on some of them. He spoke of how he and \\"his comrades have come to heal their nation from a ghost that has haunted them for two decades: the poltergeist of Vietnam.\\" He wrote of seeing \\"the after-effects of 41 days of uninterrupted bombing.\\" AND how \\"The Arabian Desert has been used as a testing ground for every new weapon in the American arsenal.\\" He held nothing back including his feelings and emotions.<br />     The war itself ended on 28 February 1991 but that's when Steve's group was really put to work. However, Steve's war began earlier when he was first injected with the many shots required of the soldiers before they could deploy. They were already getting ill from those shots and the pills they were forced to swallow frequently that were supposed to protect them from various known nerve agents. Now \\"Steve's body is invaded with its own ghost of torment.\\" He and his fellow soldier's have been \\"brutally introduced to `The Mystery Illness'\\" better known to the American public as Persian Gulf Syndrome.<br />     As Steve sat onboard that C-5A he reflected on his life, family, friends, and how he got to that point in his life. He realized he was 23 years old and now responsible for ten other lives in his squad. His wife was being left behind, out of work due to a back injury, to handle everything that he normally did.<br />     He wrote about growing up in a loving household in New England-an area that I'm very familiar with-of his school years, and his best friend. Steve spoke of their very special friendship. His friend wanted to go in the Marine Corps but Steve thought that joining the Army and being trained as an MP would help him in his ultimate goal of working in Law Enforcement. They chose the Army National Guard. He wrote about their Basic Training, the first MP Company they were assigned to, and the company that Steve transferred into that eventually went to Saudi Arabia.<br />     Steve wrote of his parents and siblings. He spoke of his uncle who served in Vietnam and how that war affected him. This author readily shared the love of his life, his girlfriend who became his wife, with his readers. They had a story book romance which went bad in large part due to the after effects of the war.<br />     Steve wrote about finally getting the word that his group was returning home. They attempted to smuggle some souvenirs out. They were on their way to the most glorious homecoming scene in decades in the US. Steve had seen and experienced so much. He wrote \\"the Army had broken him down....He was affected physically, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually.\\"<br />     The soldiers were whisked through out-processing-nothing like what they went through when they were in-processed. \\"The Army wasn't even pretending to care. Like their Vietnam War predecessors, Uncle Sam just wanted them off his menial payroll.\\" They soon learned \\"It was going to be a long fight.\\" This was going to effect his relationship with his wife too.<br />     His book went onto explain what was done to him, how it effected his relationship with his wife, and what he ultimately did. When his wife became pregnant he worried the whole nine months that he would have passed on his illness to his son. Steve spoke of deciding to change jobs and how he came to realize what would make him feel better.<br />     As I said at the beginning this was an amazing book. This is one book that needs to be read in its entirety by everyone. Go through his life with him, journey to a foreign land, and pray for him as he goes. This is truly an inspirational story even though the author has changed the names of the people and units to protect them and wrote it in third person. I highly recommend it.	2001-07-25

The author is good and writing about the area she knows so well-downtown Albany was great. Being familiar with this area myself-I felt like I was right on Madison Avenue and witnessing the accident.<br />The author takes you through an agonizing accident that nearly kills someone. The driver falls in love with the victim as she goes through her own family problems. The story interweaves personal feelings, romance, and intrigue throughout the book. <br />This love between the two main characters grows but is not spoken about for some time. The author keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for one of them to come out and say something to the other. The romance builds without really being put in the written word. I have to say this is one of the best lesbian novels I've read.	2001-04-28

Having already had a copy of Olga Gruhzit-Hoyt's book about the women who served during World War II, I was anxious to read her latest book A Time Remembered: American Women in the Vietnam War (Presidio Press, ISBN 0891416692, 272 pages). What made it even more interesting for me was that I knew some of the women mentioned in her new book.  Knowing how hard of a time I have had getting some women Veterans to open up, I was interested to see how the author collected her information and put it together. I quickly realized that she laid out her book by branches of the military and then the civilians who also served.  She started quickly by stating, \\"Estimates of the number of women who served in Vietnam vary, ranging from 7,500 to 11,000 military women, with the greatest number being nurses. Add to this arbitrary figure the hundreds and hundreds of women sponsored by civilian organizations, and the figure could be near thirty thousand.\\"  As I opened the front cover I soon realized that I have already met or been in touch with some of the women the author interviewed. That helped to make this book even more interesting to me. Each chapter was about another woman and what she did during the Vietnam War. Each was powerful in its own right.  The first eleven chapters were about the women who served as nurses in Vietnam. The author had five members of the Army Nurse Corps (ANC), two who were in the Navy Nurse Corps (NNC) and four women from the Air Force Nurse Corps (AFNC).<br /> Naturally having served in the Army myself I was more familiar with the terminology used by the five women who were in the ANC as well as the three women who were in the Women's Army Corps (WAC).  The nurses had been with the 36th Evacuation (EVAC) Hospital, 67th EVAC, 91st EVAC, and 24th EVAC. They were in Vung Tau, Qui Nhon, Tuy Hoa, and Long Binh respectively. The events they described were amazing. The WACs had been in Saigon and Long Binh.  Other chapters included stories from civilians. Thosewomen were in Vietnam with the Special Services, United Service Organization (USO), American Red Cross (ARC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID).  Some of the chapters were actually written by the women themselves. Others were put together following interviews and emails between the author and the women. Regardless of how they were done-they showed the various aspects of how these women's lives were affected both in-country and since returning to The World.  This book is a tribute to the women who volunteered to put themselves in harm's way. It should be required reading for students, as well as military members and families of those who have served. This book will help many others to understand that it is not just the male Veterans who suffer from various maladies of war.  Our women's history is very important and sadly there is not enough books written about what our women have done to serve our country. I was glad to see this one on the book shelf at my local bookstore.	2001-02-02

Last Man Out: A Personal Account of the Vietnam War by James E. Parker, Jr. is the best book I've read in a long time. If this author didn't have a tape recorder or a diary that he wrote in everyday then I have to say he has a most remarkable memory.  James takes the reader back to his home in North Carolina and introduces his family and friends. He continues as he makes the decision to enlist in the Army at a time when others were already doing everything they could to avoid serving their country.  The reader goes through Basic Training with James and his buddies at Fort Gordon, Georgia in February 1964. Two months later after being named \\"Outstanding Trainee\\" James reiterates some of his time while at his Advanced Infantry Training. You are there when he signs up for Officer Candidate School and while he waited to be selected. You go through that six-month course with him too beginning in November at Fort Benning, Georgia. Upon graduation James goes to Jump School. From there the book gets even better.  James first Permanent Party duty station was at Fort Riley, Kansas with the 1st Infantry Division. Then through his Tour of Duty in Vietnam. James told about an encounter with General William Westmoreland following a mission. The general flew in to review the troops, present medals and then was gone. It was a mere media event. When the general departed, another officer walked the line and took back the medals.  After Nam James next assignment took him to Fort Ord in Monterey, California. He became the Officer-in-Charge of the 6th Army Area Drill Sergeant School. It was a great assignment. BUT James was thinking about leaving the Army but he \\"felt guilty about forsaking my duty, abandoning my obligation to country at a time of war.\\"  Unable to find a job that suited him he applied for and was accepted as a member of the Central Intelligence Agency. By September 1971 James was headed back to Southeast Asia \\"as a case officer in the Lao program, the CIA's largest covert operation.\\" James was involved with several operations before heading stateside in 1973. He spoke openly about them.  By January 1975 James was the only American left in Vi Thanh province. At that point he secured himself a \\"bodyguard.\\" James wrote of the fall of Ban Me Thout, Hue, Da Nang, and Saigon. He took part in the evacuation of the Vietnamese who worked as agents for the CIA. He spoke of the problems encountered onboard the USS Vancouver and the transfer to the USNS Pioneer Contender.  James Parker Jr. wrote an incredible account of his military and civilian service to our country and the people of South Vietnam. It is a book well worth reading. I'm glad I had the opportunity to meet the author in person in 1998. AND I'm glad I took the time to read his book. You will be also.	2001-02-02

It is better than his first--if that it possible. This book will have the Young Adult audience begging to read more. The author's description of the African wilderness and wildlife is wonderful. The suspense he has added to it throughout the book made it a marvelous read. The MacGregor family adventures continued in this action book. I wondered how long it would take the three teenagers to get to safety. The intrigue of animal poachers, high tech equipment, and helicopters galore keep me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to see where the next book takes this family of adventurers.	2000-10-22

It's not often that I read books that are primarily for young adults but I'm so glad I received a copy of Cayman Gold: Lost Treasure of Devils Grotto by Richard Trout. This is the first book of a series that Richard is doing for LangMarc Publishing in San Antonio, Texas.<br />He started the book with historical information about lost treasure ships from 1622. Then delves into this family visiting the Cayman Islands. I had heard about these islands before but had no idea where they were. Now I know.<br />I'm not a skin-diver but this book really caught my interest. Richard took three young people and put them right in the middle of a mystery underwater. As he wrote and as I read I could feel myself swimming with scuba gear right along with the kids. He described their adventure to a tee and kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />From his description of the reef, diving equipment, mini-subs, and hurricanes-it's obvious that Richard knows what he's talking about. AND he even threw in a little romance.<br />This is a must read book! Its not only a good story but also has a glossary of new words for young adults as well as a suggested activities list. I highly recommend Cayman Gold and look forward to reading Richard's second book Elephant Tears: Mask of the Elephant.	2000-09-24

It brought forth more women than I was even  aware of who did so much for their country during the Civil War. Elizabeth  D. Leonard should be proud of the work she put into her research and  writing. This book should be a welcomed item to anyone's collection but  especially for students to learn more women's history.<br />I only have one  complaint. There was no mention of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker who also served  during the Civil War and was ultimately the only woman to date to receive  the Congressional Medal of Honor for her actions during the war. I hope  this was just an oversight on the author's part.<br />BUT believe the rest of  this book is wonderful!	1999-06-10

However I was quite surprised to read that she had been smuggled into  Leghorn (a very special outpost) in 1970. The rest of this book was just as  amazing and I was surprised to read about some of the people whom I've had  the pleasure to meet in the past few years. This is a book which every  student and adult should read. This is the best book I've read about the  Special Operations personnel and what they did.	1998-10-07

His manner of writing is extremely good and easy to understand.  While the book is thick--it is full of information that took him years to uncover.  I'm so glad I had the opportunity to meet the author, get an autographed copy, and then sat back to read it cover to cover.  This is not a book you want to skip around in reading, although you could easily do it.  He has included a glossary and an index to make it easier for some to find things and define them.  There should be more books like this one for our historians as well as students to read.  I'm sure glad I did.  Thanks Mr. Bows for keeping the memories of so many Veterans alive!	1998-06-28

However, I was not prepared for the emotions I felt when I read the first chapter. The author's husband of twenty-nine years walked out on her the day after Christmas. Without an explaination, no less! How dare he? It's no wonder she was in disbelief, angry, frustrated and fearful. Those same emotions shared by others who are suddenly widowed, seperated, or divorced.      Turning to her church, praying to her deceased brother, and talking to friends helped. Redecorating their bedroom to her bedroom helped. Learning to relax, eliminating caffeine, reading, and watching television helped.      Like the seasons change, everything changes--slowly life goes on and confidence returns. The author's explaination of touch deprevation was so true. Her comments regarding her emotional pain showed how it lasted nearly two years. She shared her experience at church the first time she attended alone and how she felt ashamed even though she was the one left behind. Her emotions impacted on her grown children. She showed how her pastors, friends, and family helped her to regain her confidence and sense of belonging.      When I was First Alone: A Journey from Hurt to Healing is a book for anyone who has suffered a loss due to death, separation, or divorce. It is inspiring and moving. I highly recommend this book and wish it was available when my own family suffered losses.	1997-12-22

Ron Birk's book St. Murphy's Commandments is one of those books you laugh at while reading it. Murphy's Laws says &quot;If anything can go wrong--it will&quot; and we know there are no saints called Murphy.      Minister, writer, and speaker the author pokes fun at the church, ministers, lay people, and parishioners. The &quot;commandments&quot; are anecdotes about every aspect of the church accompanied by illustrations by David Espurvoa.      An example is &quot;Eve's Tenet of Temptation: Each of us has our forbidden fruit.&quot; This is shown with a drawing of a woman ready to dig into a large ice cream sunday. Another is &quot;The Don't-Print-Them--and-They-Will-Come Code: The fewer bulletins printed, the more people will attend worship that Sunday.&quot;      This is a cute book for any church going individual or minister. The author and publisher have given permission to reproduce the cartoons for church publications provided proper credit is given on each cartoon or &quot;commandment.&quot;	1997-12-22
