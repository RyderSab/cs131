Calvin's many adventures with girls, teachers, bullies, and, of course, his parents, chronicle that ephemeral stage of life when the world remains at bay and we live in the present. Best of all, the author kept Calvin frozen in time, so that we never had to confront the sad fate of Puff the Magic Dragon when Jackie Paper no longer believed.<br /><br />In a sense, the memories conjured here are part of the collective consciousness of our culture, and their expression reminds us of the power of humor, friendship, and daydreaming.	2005-10-04

The story that spirals out from this moment relies more on character development than action. Propelled by vision or prayer, their widower father Jeremiah, a man who indeed does have the Lord's ear; his younger sister Swede, who lugs around a typewriter and composes verse and story; and Rube, who sets more things in motion than he intended, leave on a quest to find Davy before the law does.<br /><br />Author Leif Enger proves a dazzling story teller, interweaving Old Testament stories, tales of Butch Cassidy and other western outlaws, the agony of asthma, and the bleak beauty of winter in the Badlands. Dashes of romance, mysticism, and judicial misfirings add to this odd but palpable mix.<br /><br />Mr. Enger writes in a nearly unfiltered prose---as though he is barely there---and the narrative tends to unfold at a natural pace save for a few intrusive segues when God and religious conviction alter the natural order and pace. Still I like this novel for all the same reasons I dislike John Irving's writings: readers certainly must suspend their disbelief, but they do not have to distend it to unheard of levels.	2005-08-29

Those interested in citing or referencing classic quotes will find plenty from the expected sources of the Bible, Shakespeare, Milton, Dr. Johnson, Boswell, Swift, and Tennyson, for example. Euclid, Buddha, Emerson, and Dostoyevsky make appearances, along with a vast array of others who have multiple citations. Yet many others luminaries, such as Jane Elliot, Galileo, and Caligula, have but a single utterance cataloged.<br /><br />One third of the book is given over to the indices, an indispensable utility that really serves as the engine, allowing users to search by name and more importantly by key words and topics, which serve to propel most quotation seekers on their quests.<br /><br />The typeface used for the quotations is quite small but readable, but the even smaller point size employed for the index may push one's trifocals to the limit.<br /><br />Now that many of these quotes are available on the Internet from various sources (not all are entirely accurate and many are specialized), books of quotations seem quaint and musty, no doubt. Still I would rather delve into a tome such as this, knowing that its author cared deeply about their work and less about conveniences.	2005-06-07

The photos are quite good, and the selected text was chosen with care and thought.<br /><br />I'm not, however, able to make the required leap and see any real link between the words and images in this book. Perhaps I'm being way too literal here in wondering if dogs possess the sort of consciousness prone to contemplation, but I've never thought that Zen was prone to cuteness. Also, the typography used for some of the text pages is jarring, even irritating, when a simpler, cleaner arrangement would have sufficed.<br /><br />I appreciate the merits of Zen and of dogs but yoking the two together does not yield a compelling message or insights.

This bold scheme pays off for author Susanna Clarke, allowing her plenty of room to blend history and fiction in a manner that is convincing and entertaining. Anchored by many, many pithy footnotes, the book's version of the history of English magic become believable and compelling, much live H.P. Lovecraft's Miskatonic University and environs begin to take on a life of their own.<br /><br />The characters at the heart of the book, Mr. Norrell, a bookish, boorish loner, and Jonathan Strange, a brooding, brilliant romantic, are opposites bound together by their singular skills at wielding and interpreting magic. A host of supporting characters, some historical transplants and other fictional archetypes, populate the sprawling tale and numerous subplots. Indeed, two of these, John Childermass and Stephen Black are the most vital, engaging characters in the novel, and arguably they upstage the main characters much like Flay and Swelter do for a time in the first two Gormenghast novels. Could one or both take center stage in an encore?<br /><br />Ms. Clarke chooses her words carefully, employing her poetic license fully in using a hybrid dialect to add another level of verisimilitude to the story. Admittedly, sometimes this literary device is a bit grating, but anyone who makes it past the first few chapters likely won't mind.<br /><br />I have one point of contention, not with Ms. Clarke, per se, but with reviewers and critics who mistakenly categorize this novel as fantasy. It's not. The fantasy novel has a distinct set of characteristics, and other than magic being an everyday sort of occurrence, \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\\" has little in common with the initial forays into fantasy by William Morris or the form's finest expression in Professor J.R.R. Tolkien's works.	2005-04-15

The editor Elise Lufkin and photographer Diana Walker document these success stories with pithy narratives that capture the human perspective and revealing black and white photos that say more about the dogs than the people. Taken together, the text and images reveal convey the strength of the bond between humans and dogs and vice versa.<br /><br />The book runs the gamut from small to large, pure bred to mutt dogs, and, likewise, captures a good portion of the human spectrum from blue collar workers to celebrities, from young to old, and from those already savvy about canines to neophyte owners.<br /><br />A trend that recurs in many of the tales is that bringing a new dog home requires work, patience, and understanding (those same qualities these dogs' previous humans lacked). The author provides a number of resources in the appendices for those who want to rescue or adopt a dog or learn more about training and recreation.<br /><br />Certainly, Ms. Lufkin and Ms. Walker are preaching to the choir in a sense, but one hopes that anyone thinking of adding a dog to his or her family will perhaps check out a book like this one first to obtain a better sense of the rewards and effort that are the inherent, intertwined realities of responsible dog ownership.	2005-04-15

This book is actually a compendium of articles previously published when \\"Brown's Guide to Georgia\\" existed as a magazine. Hence, these descriptions of outdoor activities were lifted from articles that were originally published from the 1970s through the mid 1980s. Here they were repackaged and grouped by the geographic regions of Georgia.<br /><br />Consequently, the information about landmarks, amenities such as local lodging and eateries, roads and routes, property owners, and so on will be of minimal value at this point. Some of the descriptions of hikes, rivers, land forms, and parks may still be largely accurate and will at least be historically interesting.<br /><br />The format of the book works against easy reading, for its cut and paste look appears jumbled and tired by any standards.

First, people not organizations are the doers. Does \\"however good or poor\\" modify the existing plan or the organizations? Can there exist a nonexistent plan? Can a \\"ground up revision\\" be used for mulching the perennial garden? Can you actually preface and update, plus be upfront, in the same sentence?

This collection of stories written or dictated by parents of children with disabilities offers information, insights, anecdotes, and snippets from their lives and experiences.<br /><br />Many of the chapters are indeed sobering and deliver a welcomed jolt of optimism and hope. Some recount the efforts required to get the medical professionals to get off their high horse and focus on the evidence they either cannot grasp or discount. Many recount the work, progress, and advocacy that are required as parents have to become social, educational, legal, and even medical icebreakers that plow through the morass of societal obstacles imposed on anyone outside the narrow confines of what is deemed \\"normal.\\" Some of the best advice here is that parents let go of guilt and blame about unchangeable events---advice that mirrors some of the Buddhists texts I've read as well.<br /><br />A few stories fail to convince me that those involved are not still legitimately in denial, particularly those that convey sentiments such as \\"we would not change anything,\\" or \\"we would not be given anything we could not handle.\\" I'm also bothered a bit by assertions of gratitude toward a disabled child for helping a parent gain insight, strength, or wisdom because all children potentially should provide these opportunities.<br /><br />Overall, this is quite valuable book for families who are coming to terms with the death of their dreams while new dreams are being fomented. The sage advice to focus on abilities not disabilities rings true, again, as much for \\"normal\\" children as for those without a disability. In that regard, this book should probably be required reading for anyone who plans to have a family and who is naïve about the way the genetic lottery works<br /><br />Moreover, without delving too deeply into this subject, the focus of this book, in my opinion, is not to diminish the lives, experiences, or contributions of anyone who has any sort of disability, but to convey the idea that matters beyond anyone's control do affect and transform others. No judgment should be implied or inferred by such recognition about the intrinsic value of any person.<br /><br />So do I dream new dreams? Sometimes, at some levels, I do when I'm awake.

Themes include how the common man suffers at the whims of politicians, the joys of public drinking, existing on the fringes or polite society, and antiracial tirades.<br /><br />Mr. Lunchbox infused his writing with strong verbs and stark phrasing and favored energy over imagery. This body of work is best read out loud or even set to song. (Big Fish Ensemble, who were friends and fellow performers, turned his poem Hummingbird into a raucous, cacophonous melding of drums, horns, guitars, and vocals.)<br /><br />Mr. Lunchbox, despite his outwardly crazed demeanor---imagine a six-foot-four man dressed in bib overalls, wearing bug-eye glasses, wielding a chainsaw or carrying a sign that declared \\"Will work for drugs,\\" and sporting a bra---was quite a gentleman whose tragic passing in a van accident robbed us of a unique voice.	2004-12-02

He seizes on several themes, honor, rebellion, alienation, love, nationalism, and responsibility to forge these links.<br /><br />The results are decidedly mixed for Mr. Williamson sometimes seems to omit detail for conjecture without justifying his viewpoint. The author may make too much of some of the linked themes here, for sometimes he seems to be straining to force circumstances in Borges' life to correspond to a story or poem. That is not to deny the clearly articulated autobiographical nature of Mr. Borges' writing. But Borges favored the aforementioned themes and a well-known and oft-used set of symbols---tigers, mirrors, daggers, books, and so on---throughout his career and did not necessarily employ a specific theme because of a particular event.<br /><br />Borges' political philosophies and missteps are crucial elements as are his early artistic leanings toward the avant garde. His boldness in those areas contrasts harshly with his sometimes weak personality, most notably demonstrated by his nearly lifelong deference to his mother (who lived to be 99) and his repeated failing at establishing and maintaining a meaningful, normal long-term romantic relationship until he was elderly.<br /><br />Whether one quibbles with Mr. Williamson's presentation, one has to admire the attention to detail and the effort he has poured into \\"Borges: A Life.\\"  Mr. Williamson has consulted with an array of sources, reviewed myriad documents, and perhaps more crucially, interviewed many who knew Borges, especially Maria Kodoma, his companion and eventually his wife. Yet while he often seems to leave no stone unturned, he otherwise glosses over other significant events such as Borges' estrangement from his remaining family after his mother died or his separation from literary compatriots and collaborators.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer here noted---and I agree---there is some degree of repetition employed in this biography, perhaps a tad too much. At times the book drags a bit and in other spots it does compel one to stay up a bit too late. All in all, this biography meets its stated goal of examining Borges' literary output in context of his life. But the result of applying this lens is that Borges the person does not fully come into view and the characterizations may make him appear more ineffectual and enigmatic that he actually was.<br /><br />I support the notion that this work will remain an important but imperfect distillation of Borges' life but suspect that some scholarly missive will one day supplant \\"Borges: A Life\\" as the definitive biography of Borges.s and collaborators.  <br /> <br />As a previous reviewer here noted---and I agree---there is some degree of repetition employed in this biography, perhaps a tad too much.

The artwork and testimonies pitch an impression that the author offers solutions and distills the wisdom of real-life experience. Moreover, the fact that this book does not focus on physical disabilities was not clearly articulated in the editorial reviews.<br /><br />This book is more of a case study that details Dr. Straub's three-year study of seven pairs of children, a \\"normal\\" child and a developmentally disabled child. Despite the many interesting observations chronicled during this case study, the author too often, in my opinion, falls back on vague postulates such as \\"Between parental influences and all the complexities of cultural influences, understanding the influences on children's friendships can be an unpredictable process.\\"<br /><br />The author's conclusions are topical but often general, and the omission of children with physical disabilities---who often also have developmental disabilities placing them in double jeopardy for isolation---puzzles me.<br /><br />Also, the striking lack of current research from the experts---most of the sources cited in this book are from the '80s and many are from the '70s---in the field proves again that the real experts are the parents of special needs children, and the wisdom of such parents (not just the comments from parents of the children in the case study) would have complimented and expanded the author's observations.<br /><br />Despite such lapses, the author does address the topic with respect and sensitivity, noting that \\"It is the withdrawn, isolated child who is easily overlooked who becomes invisible.\\" Her ideas for improving the social support for children with special needs are commendable but I suspect rarely employed in schools where the unruly rule and the disabled often languish.	2004-09-23

We have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions, therapy dogs, even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world.<br /><br />The notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new, but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of \\"the greatest generation\\" is new (at least to me).<br /><br />Mr. Katz visits with many dogs and their owners of various social economic strata who inhabit the enclaves of Montclair, New Jersey.  More often than not, he found that dogs are being used as emotional surrogate, a classic situation noted in attachment theory but hitherto mostly applied to other people. Many of these dogs are pampered, untrained, and confused. Others are abused to some extent, whether through deliberate actions or through negligence.<br /><br />The stories are alarming and informing. I see many of the mistakes I made with previous dogs laid out before me and wonder if my two Australian shepherds are as well-adjusted as they seem.<br /><br />Many reviewers have commented, and correctly, that anyone planning to own a dog needs to read this book. Sadly, I think Mr. Katz will largely reach those people who already possess a great deal of knowledge about dogs---those who train their dogs, who buy or adopt breeds suitable for their living conditions or schedules, and who treat their dogs with consistent, loving authority.<br /><br />Mr. Katz does not make harsh judgments on any of the circumstances he depicts but instead concludes by noting how many dogs are dumped in shelters where they languish or die.

The format of the book itself hinders the reader: the type is too small and relentlessly the same; the examples that follow the rules are set in even smaller type; no visual guides or aids link paired columns of text, making one's eyes climb up and down; and the chapters lack any internal navigational devices to help the reader find his or her way.<br />The author's explanations lack the authority required for this book to find a spot on my desk. For instance, we are told that a comma may be used to separate the month from the year when the date is omitted, but that current usage permits writing the month and year without a comma between them. I prefer the definitive advice in &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style,&quot; which indicates no comma is needed when a month and year appear without the date.<br />In discussing the use of colons to introduce a list, the author allows a colon to follow a verb, bringing the sentence to a dead stop and interrupting the connection of verb and object or complement.<br />References to the Government Printing Office Style Manual do not help her case. That style manual is hopelessly outdated and insular<br />In fairness, Ms. Shertzer delivers a no-frills, somewhat taciturn overview to grammar and usage and one could do much worse than to follow most of the advice here.

And in that case, this book's usefulness would be minimal. Seasoned editors and writers would not find this book that useful and many no doubt have nearly new, little used copies of this book wedged into their reference shelves.	2004-06-01

On the other hand, Dr. Pallandino has rounded up plenty of good information and strategies for motivating children to complete tasks, pay attention in school, and essentially get their heads out of the clouds.<br />Part of the problem here is that this book essentially categorizes children as either having an Edison-trait---that is being very smart, imaginative, and free-spirited---or not. While I think most parents would like to associate their children with Edison, the roles of self-discipline, focus, and, extra effort in improving learning and performance are downplayed. And most parents already know that those ingredients have to be part of the mix.<br />But there are enough positives here to make this book worth a read. Learning how to teach children how to break down tasks into components, striving to improve one's patience, working as a team, and remembering to reward achievements are all good things. Although such advice is certainly valuable for helping any child, not just those who have this Edison-trait.<br />The dichotomy between convergent thinking and divergent thinking, a core idea in this book, seems a bit artificial and a bit too clear-cut to me (true, I'm only a parent and former teacher) but I find most real-life issues a bit more blurry. But this model does illustrate to a good degree the serious \\"dumbing down\\" problems inherent in our education systems.<br />The sections on therapy, ADD, and professional diagnosis were the least intriguing and least inspiring.<br />Realizing that there are different ways to approach a situation has its value, and the author's greatest success here is reminding readers to step back and consider the options.	2004-04-11

This modern day, more or less adaptation of Aesops Fables delights the eyes with bizarre artwork and tickles the brain with weirdly pitched morality tales.<br />It's hard to convey what the dialogue between a duckbilled platypus and a Beefsnakstick might sound like, but underneath the wackiness is a message about what makes someone, or something, special. Ditto the tale about the competition between a piece of toast and a bowl of Fruit Loops, which shows the pitfalls of vanity.<br />The illustrations and text work together here, with the layers of humor ricocheting from one to the other.<br />Some will scratch their heads and shun this book.

Despite attempts by many pundits to displace this venerable guide, it remains solidly perched at the top of the heap of texts on writing and editing.<br />This book endures for many reasons, including the clear, concise prose that strikes to the heart of the matter; splendid examples that do not try to be cute; and short imperatives that codify the essence of good writing.<br />No copy editor can go forth unless armed with this book, and any writer striving to deliver an understandable message likely has a dog-eared copy lying about.<br />These precepts about clarity, correctness, and conciseness cut across all disciplines. Hence, this vigorous defense of clear writing is needed more than ever as a tidal wave of information, most of it ill-conceived, openly manipulative, and poorly written, floods our consciousness.<br />Having an enduring touchstone such as The Elements of Style available helps one write better and dismiss boorish drivel more easily.	2004-02-11

Finding the right tone for these comments has also proved hard. The book does provide a good but incomplete cross-section about how being the father of a disabled child affects one's life.<br />The editor, Donald Meyer, allows a number of fathers, most of whom are well-educated and from the higher socioeconomic strata, to share their experiences. Some are moving accounts that clearly depict the frustration, isolation, and sometimes enlightenment associated with parenting a child who is disabled.<br />Some are down-right irritating laments about a father's broken dreams or lost opportunities.<br />Regardless, the stories here are important, for they offer insights to parts of the human experience that, unless you are a member of this fraternity, most folks will never understand. Somehow, I wish that there could be both a wider audience for this book so that those in the mainstream might have an inkling of what happens to a family that includes a disabled individual.<br />I also wish that there were more stories from the blue-collar dads who struggle not only to survive financially but emotionally when their lives are also involuntarily altered by the flaws in our collective gene pool.<br />I wish also that the reflections here included more advice about how to cope with emotional issues, financial concerns, and long-term planning. My expectations were that those types of topics might be addressed more directly.<br />Still, the sketches in this book are valuable for anyone because they confirm both how fragile and resilient life really is.	2004-01-16

The author, Walter A. McDougall, spent untold hours researching and organizing minutia then interweaving vast history replete with sensory details; human and political failings, dreams, and successes; meteorological and geographic facts; and overlooked, obscure bits of history.<br />Consequently, the book itself is somewhat overwhelming for it is nearly impossible to absorb this level of detail or maintain a clear understanding of the myriad relationships and ideologies.<br />Of course, having too much detail is better than not enough in any book of this sort, and Mr. McDougall is never shy about throwing in what may be a touch of conjecture. One cannot really know what some of the many people profiled here might have been thinking, but ultimately the scope of the book prevails, and one must admire the tenacity and effort funneled in to this book.<br />Be prepared to invest some time reading this history but be forewarned that you may have to put the book down from time to time to let the facts and information swamp you like a big wave.	2004-01-16

That Arthur Koestler turned his keen intellect on these topics is not as surprising as some of the postulates he made, many of which stand still as neither disproved or confirmed.<br />He chronicles much of the research done to confirm E.S.P. and discusses both the flaws and results, results that tend to favor the existence of psychic abilities despite the fact that rigid scientific methods demotivate participants and suppress such abilities. Mr. Koestler makes the point repeatedly that coincidence, synchronicity, and parapsychology cannot necessarily be bottled up or tapped on demand, but that sometimes precipitating events will trigger such events. (I've experienced such things first-hand and concur with this view.)<br />Mr. Koestler---like other divergent thinkers such as Robert Anton Wilson, Fritjof Capra, Karl Pilbram and others---turned to physics for explanations for these phenomena, believing that an intrinsic link must exist between these two seemingly disparate disciplines. His writing on this subject is fairly strait-forward, though because this book is more than 30 years old, much of what was then state of the art now seems quaintly misdirected (sort of like the depiction of the giant HAL artificial intelligence in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\").<br />An essential point, for me, are that Mr. Koestler takes great pains to show that learned, prestigious persons---e.g., Jung, Rhine, Kammerer, Eddington---have been delving into this research for centuries, often at great personal cost to their careers or images.<br />Rereading this book now, I tend to side with Jung's view of refusing \\"to commit the fashionable stupidity of regarding everything I cannot explain as a fraud.\\" In other words, I'm not sold on everything here, but I think this well-articulated treatise on parapsychology that well-worth the time. Or put another way (with apologies to Lennon): All we are saying is give E.S.P. a chance.at well-worth the time.

She offers plenty of examples and checklists as well.<br />Unfortunately, because this book (my signed copy at least) was published in 1986, some of the appendices, such as a list of addresses for various scientific and medical associations, will no longer have any value.

Writers, researchers, indexers, proofreaders, editors, publishers, archivists, and educators will all find common ground in the collective wisdom found here.<br />Those already familiar with other incarnations of this guide will find that is still the authority on a multitude of topics. Most of my initial forays have been in the fifth chapter on grammar and usage, a chapter that exhaustively covers all the parts of speech and provides an excellent guide to word usage. A separate chapter covers all aspects of spelling and the distinctive treatment accorded many works, including compounds. If only the eighth chapter on terms and names could be passed into law, then maybe some of the nonsensical and false capitalization that is applied so rampantly to military, political, scientific, religious, geographic, and government names could be controlled. Still, this information provides those willing to take on the fight with plenty of ammo to do it unreservedly. Likewise, the sixth chapter on punctuation will vindicate language purists who insist (as I do) that we have to uphold our standards and rules for punctuation to avoid anarchy in our writing.<br />A chapter on numbers jumps right into the common fray about whether to use numerals or words, providing myriad examples and not displacing the use of common sense in certain instances. There are plenty of nitty-gritty details here: when to use the en dash with inclusive numbers; how to form plurals of numbers (no apostrophes need apply); what is the correct way to express currency. Chapter 14, which is one of the many sections that reflects how technology has advanced our options and choices regarding printed communications, is essential reading for those in the scientific and technology fields and offers details likely not found in other guides of this sort, such as listing fonts frequently used for mathematical symbols.<br />The chapters on references, documentation, manuscript preparation, and indexing will likely be touchstones for the next decade. In these chapters, as throughout this guide, the articulate discussions of principals, guidelines, and rules are augmented with examples. The examples reflect a wide mode of communications, from print to the Internet. A chapter on rights and permissions ought to be mandatory reading for all college students. It pretty much covers what is and is not legal without smothering one with legalese.<br />Appendix A: Design and Production is not for everyone, but I've always be intrigued by the whole process of making books from the first scribbled outline to the binding process, so I find it an interesting read. And if you need more information, a generous 15-page bibliography offers more resources.<br />This edition is easy to search and use. The typography is more modern and less tiring on the eyes though the light blue type can be hard to read. (Was this \\"nonrepro blue\\" used as a countermeasure against photocopying and scanning?)

The presentation works by showing the various regions or sections of the body at various angles and at posterior, medial, and lateral viewpoints.<br />Instead of relying solely on illustrations (as the venerable &quot;Gray's Anatomy&quot; does), this atlas also employs superb photographs from cadavers and selected radiographs. But let's go back to the illustrations. These detailed, finely rendered color illustrations set this atlas apart. Pairing these with the photographs allows one to clearly see structures, tissues, and organs.<br />A brief but thorough user's guide clearly explains how to effectively use this atlas. Armed with an understanding of how of how the images are labeled, what nomenclature is used, and which abbreviations have been appropriated, even a lay person can set off to explore the inner structures of the human body.<br />Note that, as the preface states, this test &quot;is foremost a visual guide and interactive learning resource to be used in conjunction with a clinical anatomy book.&quot; Hence, one must not expect this book to explain the role and function of the body's various systems and structures.	2003-09-17

The problem is not her writing---which is clear, thorough, abundant---but my own lack of knowledge about the history, culture, and people who shaped Buddhism.<br />To find those answers first-hand, Ms. David-Neel spent several years in Tibet, interviewing monks, abbots, spiritual leaders, and philosophers. The amount of material she must have collected is staggering, given that one assumes this book represents a distillation of that body of research.<br />Though I'm not sure what effect, if any, the following fact had in shaping the book, Ms. David-Neel was in effect undercover, dressing as man, to gain access to places and audiences with people off limits to women in Tibet at that time (and they may still be to some degree).	2003-08-28

In a remarkable series of insightful short prose selections, the reader learns a great deal about Einstein's views on morality and ethics; religion, particularly Judaism; government; the arts, literature, and higher education; philosophy; and government. His personal letters to and observations about other key persons of his time including Shaw, Freud, Gandhi, and Lorentz illustrate what a fully integrated individual Einstein truly was, a view that may counter some of the extreme depictions that render him a genius incapable of focusing beyond his science.<br />Having some many thoughts from this astounding intellect pulled into one volume makes this book a worthwhile addition to the stack of rainy day books.  It's a book to be consumed in fits and starts, with a cup of coffee on the screened porch in the rain, a treat for inquiring minds.<br />The prose, perhaps a tad stilted by modern standards, is lucid. And seeing Einstein turn his attention on the topic everyone wrangles with forges a new link to him and his work. As he stated, \\" The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.\\"	2003-08-22

Reviving the tree serves as a balm to their imaginations, as they fantasize about the tree growing up, out, and below their apartment. Hence, the title, The Tree that Grew to the Moon.<br />Each fantasy scenario is excellently illustrated and the story moves briskly to the point the girl decides it would be better to plant the tree outdoors. This decision conjures up a new wave of imaginary depictions about how the tree will bring joy to the neighborhood.<br />Eugenie Fernandes, who is both author and illustrator, crafts a sweet tale that is not condescending or cloaked in some sort of lesson.

Tufte again raises the bar both on his scholarly treatment of how we portray visual information and on how books of value ought to me made.<br />His third book on information design, Visual Explanation: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative is, in his words, \\"about pictures of verbs, the representation of mechanism and motion, process and dynamics, causes and effects, explanation and narrative.\\"<br />Within this book, Mr. Tufte first tackles tough, fundamental issues related to quantity, scale, and magnitude. Determining if a visual representation is honest or accurate may, at first, not seem a vital skill, but Mr. Tufte clearly shows how data and information can be distorted or manipulated and offers sharp observations to help one see more clearly what is presented.<br />He addresses methods of presenting and analyzing data, using the now classic medical investigative work of John Snow and the fatal flawed decision making that resulting in the Challenger tragedy, to build a steady, compelling argument that there are right and wrong ways to show data.<br />A chapter on magic and designing disinformation is full of anecdotes, examples, and illustrations about the how's and why's of masking content and diverting attention.<br />Perhaps my favorite chapter is The Smallest Effective Difference, a challenging but insightful primer on using subtle but effective visual distinctions to create compelling visual information.<br />The long chapter about visual parallelism treats a complex subject by offering a plethora of examples, all explained with a terse elegance. Students of typography will take a special interest in Mr. Tufte's treatment of letterforms.<br />How we use and react to multiple images and how to effectively use multiples to evoke repetition, change, pattern, and surprise form the basis of the next chapter. Mr. Tufte again reminds readers that good design must take into account how, when, and even where information will be used.<br />The final chapter covers what Mr. Tufte has termed visual confections, that is an assembly of myriad visual events to convey a story, make comparisons, merge the real and imaginary. Digital artists should switch off their Macintosh computers until they have studied carefully this chapter, replete with superb illustrations and laser-intense commentary.<br />Mr. Tufte self-publishes his books because no commercial press would indulge his demands for perfection. His books are wonderful not just because of the information he presents but also because they represent the craft of bookmaking. The printing, binding, the acid-free paper, inks, the arrangement of words and images---these books are to treasure when so much is disposable and fleeting.final chapter covers what Mr. Tufte has termed visual confections, that is an assembly of myriad visual events to convey a story, make comparisons, merge the real and imaginary.

Buchanan, a multilingual scholar who was educated in Western schools but lived and studied in Japan, renders superbly transparent translations of the hundred haiku he has selected and offers insightful annotations that guide but do not limit one's interpretation of the poems.<br />The poems also appear in Japanese characters and in romaji, which is a Romanized version of the original Japanese. A number of the poems are shown in calligraphic versions, utterly unreadable to the untrained, but strikingly beautiful nonetheless.  Those pages are, in my view, the most fulfilling within this book.<br />... This printing of \\"One Hundred Famous Haiku\\" is well-made. The covers are strong, durable, and striking. The pair of deep green pages at the front and back of the book (four pages at each juncture) have a calming effect.<br />I highly recommend that you seek a copy if you do not have one.	2003-07-17

Or so the very understated text would have you believing.<br />Mr. Clement pairs the seemingly mundane depiction of Amanda' routine with madcap illustrations that wildly play upon the notion of ordinariness. Her alarm clock is a fat, shirtless genie; she hitches a ride to school with her old neighbor (who happens to be a dinosaur); she bathes at the base of a waterfall with an elephant that happens to be the family's version of an SUV.<br />The vivid illustrations not only run counter to the blas&eacute; tone of the text, they also have subtle sublayers that may not be obvious during the first pass. His attention to facial expressions is also worth noting.  I liked how Mr. Clements allows generous amounts of white space to surround the illustrations, something that makes the book seem visually cooler and uncluttered despite the many details (in contrast to fellow Australian author and illustrator Graeme Base, who packs more details onto a page than almost anyone).	2003-03-20

She presents in clear, readable English, discussions about each step involved from receipt of a manuscript until publication and distinguishes key differences between books and journals and how editors and authors should approach these distinct forms of publication.<br />Ms. O'Connor tackles matters ranging from which verb tense is correct in which context, to the distinction between \\"en\\" and \\"em\\" dashes, to the rarely discussed issue of floating hyphens. She offers plenty of examples and checklists as well.<br />Unfortunately, because this book (my signed copy at least) was published in 1986, some of the appendices, such as a list of addresses for various scientific and medical associations, will no longer have any value.

Regardless, the core information about copyediting and the steps inherent in this process is neither out of style or outdated.	2003-03-12

It's fun to read about all the oddball items Prudy gathers and keeps, but without these first-rate illustrations, this might be just an average book. With them, you and your kids will find a pleasant diversion just checking out all the objects, drawings, animals, plants, etc. the spill all over the pages.<br />Prudy's collecting is way out of hand, driving her parents crazy. And when her little sister starts her own collections, things look dire.

Her crisp duotone images are honest, natural, real moments, unlike the contrived artifices other animal photographers such as William Wegman employ.<br />Hence, Ms. LeVine presents a deep yet subtle vision of how these dogs experience the world and interact with other dogs and with their humans. (If you have never owned an Aussie, it's possible you may not fully appreciate the genius of her photographs and her subjects.) Sometimes the \\"truth\\" shines in the dog's eyes or reveals itself in an image of a dog unabashedly having fun. I'm not sure if there are any high-minded lessons here, but something of the exuberance and intensity these dogs experience transcends the pages.<br />Poet Joseph Duemer contributes extraordinary, insightful phrasing that melds seamlessly with the mood of each photograph and the combination celebrates fully the Zen of dogs. He offers just enough detail and form without trying to manipulate or dictate emotions and perceptions.<br />Folks who do not share their lives with canines will find this book entertaining. Those who do will find it magical, and, among this group, those who have Aussies of their own will keep this well-crafted and well-designed book within easy reach.	2003-02-10

This clever and engaging childrens book balances nuance, detail, and wit into a series of clever portraits depicting the quest of a nose (one equipped with legs wearing trousers and a great sense of self-irony, no less) trying to find its place in the world. Consequently, the nose savors all sorts of experiences from a trip to the library, an excursion to the market, a turn on the stage, a stop by a restaurant, and so on till, tired of not fitting in, the nose lands on the couch of a therapist who gently suggests that the nose is never out of place for the whole world fits perfectly around you. . . .<br />Each setting depicts the nose against a different backdrop, and the nose is the only constant amidst the changing scenery where, and this is the really fun part, different objects form a pair of eyes and a mouth. Hence, the nose is never really out of place even though it never quite figures this out.<br />The writing strikes the right cord, and Ms. Schwarz delivers uncluttered prose that conveys the yearning to fit it and how a nose might go about assessing the world (in a restaurant, the nose suggest that \\"this is a place for mouths\\"). Mr. Stewart conjures up superb and somewhat surreal illustrations layered with details that go beyond those needed to frame the nose with the accidental features that complete the face. Those extras provide the texture that underlies the quest: discarded rail tickets, glimpses of menus, book pages. Each page is like a tapestry of sorts with lots of images held in place by, what else, the nose.<br />I would not recommend this book for youngsters who cannot yet read on their own, even though the book is so much fun you will want to read it with them. Rather, wait until your children are about seven so that they will be able to appreciate the rich detail, contextual puns, and ironic humor blended in this initial collaboration between a talented husband-wife team.	2002-11-26

And this utility is, in fact, the strength of this publication. One should not purchase it instead of, but in addition to, an atlas.

Tracing the steps of Morris' formal education, he documents how Morris was deeply affected by his studies of medieval art and literature and deeply influenced by the writings of both Carlyle and Ruskin, influences that had repercussions for the direction of Morris's artistic and political life.<br />Thompson worked from a treasure trove of material: letters, public documents, articles about William Morris, and, of course, the vast collection of literary works and political articles and speeches that Morris published.<br />He shows Morris as being at odds with Victorian sensibilities, both as an artist and political reformer, all tempered to some degree, by his illusory yearning for an ideal love, a yearning that doomed any hope of true happiness in his marriage to Jane Burden but made him an ardent reformer striving to bring about more equality for his fellow man.<br />Thompson chronicles specific incidents, such as Morris infamous arrest under false charges, with reams of details and viewpoints. This technique, while thorough, does not make for easy or quick reading. This biography is heavily weighted toward Morris's activities as a socialist reformer, and at times Thompson's commentary on Morris's literary output seems unduly colored by these socialist beliefs. This argument may be valid, as Thompson notes about Morris: \\"He looked upon the history of arts, not---as did many of his contemporaries---as the record of individual geniuses, each \\"inspired\\" and each influencing each other, but as part of wider social processes.\\"<br />Likewise, he quotes Morris as saying \\"I never set up for a critic,\\" by which me means that art is a \\"solace,\\" an expression of \\"pleasure,\\" thus, in some measure, confirming that Morris trivialized both the creative process and the role of art in society.<br />There is, in my view, not enough balanced information on the myriad contributions Morris made to literature---especially The Wood beyond the World, The Well at the World's End, and The Water of the Wondrous Isles---and other novels he wrote during the final decade of his life. Those works are worth more scrutiny, if for no other reason, because they clearly and firmly are the seminal works in what is now the genre of fantasy, in which Tolkien, deservedly so, reigns supreme. Yet without Morris, who was the first to combine elements from classical epic and medieval romance with conventions of the novel, this genre may not have taken form until much later.<br />I would also have expected more about the magnificent work from the Kelmscott Press, especially the much-revered Kelmscott Chaucer (if you are a book-lover, you owe it to yourself to see if a library near you has a facsimile) instead of a detailed footnote citing the various works of other experts.<br />More could have been done with the vast accomplishments Morris was responsible for in the visual arts, in his design of wallpapers, chintzes, and tapestries, as well as his furniture designs (the Morris chair indeed comes from this William Morris).<br />One other shortcoming, in my view, is that one gleans little about what Morris experienced as a child or adolescent. Also, surprisingly, there is much less detail about his marriage, his wife's affair, and his children than one would expect from a book of this scope.<br />Still, this biography is an excellent reference for the, I suspect, ever-dwindling number of scholars reviewing William Morris and his life. Bibliophiles who love biographies will not, I also suspect, readily enjoy Thompson's writing style, in which passages sometimes seem welded together with multiple colons, and who writes much more like a reporter than in the biographical style elevated by writers such as Walter Jackson Bate or David McCullough. Thompson had a daunting task before him in attempting to distill, to a single volume, the life of William Morris, of whom, upon hearing of Morris' death, remarked, \\"I consider the case is this: the disease is simply being William Morris, and having done more work than most ten men.\\"<br />Thompson no doubt did much of his research in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as the first copyright date for this book is 1955, and his writing style may seem at times harsh if compared with current biographical writing. Still, this volume is a virtual warehouse crammed with facts, accounts, details, and remembrances.efore him in attempting to distill, to a single volume, the life of William Morris, of whom, upon hearing of Morris' death, remarked, \\"I consider the case is this: the disease is simply being William Morris, and having done more work than most ten men.\\"<br />Thompson no doubt did much of his research in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as the first copyright date for this book is 1955, and his writing style may seem at times harsh if compared with current biographical writing.

It gets looser. Family members offer to help him pull it, but his friends have warned him to resist any assistance.<br />Toward the end of the book, his scary-looking weird Grandmother comes to his school to make taffy. While he is eating taffy, his tooth falls out. So his Grandmother grabs a giant piece of taffy and pulls out her false upper teeth.<br />Yep, that's the plot. And the illustrations are, if anything, well, just plain bad, culminating in the scenes when the children are eating taffy at school. It looks more like they are being attacked by alien life forms or odd sea creatures. The style is so bizarre, that one wonders if the artist used human models at all.<br />I figured this book for a mid-80s publication date, but once I finished reading it with my daughter found it was actually published in the late 90s, proving that someone will publish almost everything.<br />There are more than a hundred other kid's books out there about losing teeth. I suspect most are better than this one. And less scary.	2002-08-20

When her vinegary attitude gets her, and by implication one of her brothers, grounded while her family is out for a Saturday night of eating and dancing and music, trouble seems inevitable. Warned against a Cajun werewolf, known as D'Loup Garou, Feliciana huddles under her covers after hearing something strange outside the house.<br />But once Feliciana has convinced herself that the howling she heard was only her brother trying to get back at her, she fearlessly chases after whatever it is running through the swamp.<br />D'Loup Garou springs out, ready for a nice meal, but Feliciana has more than a few things to say until this seemingly mismatched pair learn that they are more alike than either suspected.<br />The illustrations are delightfully rendered, and the Cajun dialect is fun to tackle, even if you feel like your tongue has suddenly swollen as you try, perhaps in vain, to sound the part.	2002-08-20

There is simply little joy to be had from reciting names from an ever-growing list.<br />Moreover, the irresponsible way many of the characters treat a library book ought to strike a chord to the book lovers out there. Who would really leave a book lying on the counter of a diner, grab a book from someone's porch, put it on a park bench?<br />OK, I know this is a children's book, but the cascading series of incidents wears thin---especially after repeated readings.<br />The illustrations are engaging and well done, and the message that books are important is certainly a good one. Having each member of the parade of characters check out library books is a positive message.  But all of the repetition finally just wears me out. I really hope I don't have to read this book aloud again.	2002-08-15

He painstakingly chronicles all facets of life during the nine weeks spent traversing from Boston to the Arctic Ocean, recounting sights, sounds, encounters, and experiences at sea and on shore in various ports from Newfoundland to Greenland and back again.<br />The result is not one of those irritating \\"look, look at me\\" travel books or the ramblings of a self-absorbed trekker who intimidated his editor into leaving in the most boring of details but a refreshing recap of life at sea, warts and all..<br />Mr. Oxenhorn, motivated by a journey of spiritual discovery, soon finds his preconceived notions of life at sea challenged not only by the mundane, repetitive tasks that consume most hours, but also by his inexperience and fears that he must confront whether scaling the vertical matrix of ropes and sails or keeping watch in the middle of the night in all kinds of weather and knowing that his decisions and observation will affect the well-being of the crew and ship.<br />As the story unfolds-and more so as a novel than travelogue-Mr. Oxenhorn constantly finds surprising aspects about his crew mates that force him to reconsider them, and himself, in the context of this expedition and extrapolates from these experiences a growing sense of self-mastery and awareness of interdependence.<br />As he recounts late in the book, \\"But again, the main point wasn't the rules themselves. Nor was it to demonstrate someone's authority. . . Rather, it was to break down the habit of mind that makes exceptions and desires special treatment. To replace it with a heart called unity.\\"<br />Though this notion may sound a bit like the process used to mold soldiers in boot camp, his ruminations regarding interdependence reach a deeper resonance when he argues, both convincingly and cogently, that \\"We have made ourselves responsible for the life that ours depends on, from copepods to whales. To think differently about these animals is to think differently about ourselves as well. From now on, we must all stand watch. One tribe. One family. One crew.\\"<br />Mr. Oxenhorn takes great pains to present his facts and details with care, clearly having spent many hours researching and documenting his observations about everything from various seabirds, to the construction and operation of tall sailing ships, to traditional navigational methods involving sextant and compass and stars. His narrative jumps to life as he describes what it is like to be sailing on a wooden ship among \\"tabular icebergs twice the length of football fields and seven stories high.\\"<br />The point of the expedition was to study whale populations, and the author provides enough information about whales, their place and role in the marine environment, and how humans have affected (almost always badly) the balance of nature. He provides just enough details about how the research is conducted, what key findings are made, and what sort of future might be in store for the whale populations. Mr. Oxenhorn does not come off sounding like a overzealous, gung-ho Greenpeacer hunkered down in a Zodiac; rather he applies the same sort of calm logic to why we must carefully manage the oceans as agrarian essayist Wendell Berry proffers.<br />Likewise he captures both the ugly and shining sides of human behavior and interactions aboard ship and shore, pulling no punches even from his characterizations of Captain George Nichols, with whom Mr. Oxenhorn butted heads----and came away chastised more than once----the mates, or his peer crewmates. More than once, I cringed at some of these depictions, wondering if the author might be overstepping his rights, but he never fails to reveal the good, sometimes surprising, qualities of his shipmates.<br />If I had been Mr. Oxenhorn's editor, I might have asked for more explanation of some of the nautical and sailingterms that pepper the chronicle, maybe a glossary for those of us who will never experience firsthand such an adventure. The map inside the front cover is useful, but not nearly detailed enough, and without including the longitude and latitude lines, a puzzling lapse I would attribute to the publisher, it's not easy to track the voyage sequentially. (Most chapter titles follow this convention, for example, \\"17 July. 63&#9702;N/54&#9702;W.\\"<br />Those minor points aside, \\"Tuning the Rig\\" is the kind of book that causes you to postpone your own chores while you read about the myriad tasks of \\"field day\\" or the duties of the \\"galley slave.\\" I cannot say that I now have the urge to spend two months at sea on a tall ship, but I am grateful to Mr. Oxenhorn for his splendid account. Had he not been the faultless victim of an automobile crash, Mr. Oxenhorn, who is also a published poet, might have made quite a name for himself.ailing terms that pepper the chronicle, maybe a glossary for those of us who will never experience firsthand such an adventure.

How about oafs, churls, and louts? Did your liberal arts education not cover which part of a castle wall is properly called a merlon or a crenel? Or perhaps your science background failed to equip you with the knowledge needed to distinguish fat from tallow or parchment from vellum? Are you unsure if a particular wizard is trustworthy?<br />Then you clearly need a copy of the splendid reference by called the Book of Weird, a venerable stockpile of arcane knowledge.  The author, Barbara Ninde Byfield, has termed her work, with both modesty and accuracy, as \\"Being a most Desirable Lexicon of the Fantastical. . .\\"<br />The often tongue-in-cheek entries are truly both informative and often hilarious. For instance, we learn not only that are churls \\"ill bred, and very likely low born\\"  but also are provided with  the insight that \\"If they serve beer, they slop it: if they drink beer, they belch.\\"<br />Byfield even provides an appendix of sorts of \\"Useful Information\\" wherein you can learn about weights and measures (of course, you may already know that a firkin = 56 pounds and that an ell spans 4 feet), a list of legal holidays (including various Sabbats), and some medicinal advice that may not be for the squeamish.<br />This is the sort of book that will improve one's spirits. It's clever, smart, and fun. My only regret is that my large format copy of the 1973 edition finally fell apart because of continued use. Still, this smaller format version is worth finding and hanging onto. Also, you might find an even earlier edition published under the somewhat confusing and less descriptive title The Glass Harmonica.<br />Gotta go perform some rites. . .	2002-07-31

Helmer weaves a tale of Hannah, her Grandfather, and elusive cat they spot on the seashore one day. Through persistence and patience, Hannah slowly wins the confidence of this feral cat, drawing her at last into the home she has come to share with her Grandfather. The day-to-day simple lives of this trio, bound together by love and necessity, is revealed not only by Helmer's choice verbal depictions but also by Mombourquette wonderful illustrations. His delivers exactly the right tone for the story, matching image to words seamlessly, capturing the warmth of the home and the rugged misty beauty of the seascape.<br />The story ends with Fog Cat's unexplained disappearance, but Hannah does have left the sole surviving kitten from a litter. Helmer neatly bookends the beginning and ending of her story, neither explaining why Hannah has come to live with her Grandfather, what happened to her parents or her Grandmother at the start or resolving what happens to Fog Cat.	2002-06-21

It also delves into the steps to develop a successful laser surgery program and the legal and regulatory issues involved. Chapters on clinical applications covered the various specialties, from ophthalmology to podiatry to plastic surgery that had incorporated laser treatment techniques.<br />Now the book is quite dated. Many of the manufacturers noted in the appendix are no longer in business or were consolidated.

Mr. Katz is, by nature, a story teller, and in this compact book, he weaves together observations and anecdotes during the course of a dog year, a year he pretty much devoted to his four dogs, a pair of aging labs and a pair of young border collies.<br />The striking differences in the dispositions of the labs and Devon, a troubled border collie he adopts sight unseen constitute much of the book's premise. Mr. Katz must come to terms with Devon, a dog that is totally different from his beloved, mellow labs---so different, that he soon earns the nickname \\"Helldog.\\" In learning to train and love this high-strung, very intelligent new addition, he must confront his own notions of discipline, commitment, and duty. He does not always make the right decisions, but he willing lays out the consequences, right or wrong, for readers.<br />Though there may be lessons here for dog owners, and especially for potential dog owners, the book ultimately is a musing, and a good one, on looking honestly on life and death, seeing into one's own dark corners, and rejoicing on the primal bond between human and canine.<br />If nothing else, I would hope that Katz opens up some eyes about how much work and joy are intertwined in being a dutiful dog owner.	2002-05-28

The last novel of the late Walker Percy, this often harrowing, sometimes humorous (darkly, at least) tale should set off alarms bells as you read through this thriller. The notion of Walker Percy penning a thriller is, of itself, something odd, and a point that apparently raises the ire of many academics and even many dyed-in-the-wool Percy readers.<br /><br />And this book is different from say, The Moviegoer, in which the inward musings and vexations of the protagonist are fairly insulated from the outside world and its views, opinions, influences. Moreover, Dr. More does not act as the prototypical loner characteristic of some of Percy's other protagonists. Percy's decision to write this novel as more of a fast-paced thriller, the central story occurs over just three days, must have been his attempt to shoot a flare that would draw attention to the dehumanization that started coalescing with more fervor some 15 years ago. (Now civility may be a lost cause: people consider it proper to conduct public arguments with unseen opponents by blathering all manner of nonsense into their cell phones.)<br /><br />And so the flawed hero, the same disheveled, womanizing, fallen Catholic psychiatrist Thomas More, practically stumbles upon a scheme to control human behavior by adding radioisotopes to the water supply. After all, the perpetuators of the scheme remind him, look what fluoride has done for oral health. What if we can eliminate depression, crime, disease, and enhance learning, cognition, and memory at the same time? Relying on his beloved bourbon to keep him grounded, Dr. More, fresh out of prison for supplying truckers with uppers, finds his wife and children swept up in the scheme.<br /><br />He plays some hunches, and together with his cousin Lucy, a skilled epidemiologist who employs what was the Internet before any of us ever thought about it, discovers a scheme that is both more far-reaching and nefarious than anything since the heyday of Nazi Germany. Dr. More also allies with Vergil Bon, Jr., whose moral center and keen intellect prove pivotal in discovering the physical means of dosing the population and in confronting the horrors of pedophilia lurking under the surface.<br /><br />Both Lucy's and Bon's clearcut, strong character fly in the face of those critics who harangue Percy for creating weak or unfocused female or black characters.<br /><br />Dr. More is the moral and intellectual center of the story, and, typical of many of Percy's leading characters, he struggles to reinvent himself, to get things right, to make the correct decisions. He is not awed by authority, swayed by power, or tempted by riches. Instead, he considers himself to be ''an old-fashioned physician of the soul.''<br /><br />The parallels between this modern plot to make life better and to terminate anyone whose quality of life doesn't meet the \\"norm\\" are clearly drawn by Father Simon Rinaldo Smith, an alcoholic Catholic priest who has retreated to a fire tower where he scans the countryside for smoke and regards himself as a modern version of St. Simeon Stylites. Percy uses this character as a mouthpiece for much of his own philosophy, using a long confession from Father Smith to lay out his thesis about how evil festers and manifests under the guise of perceived goodness.<br /><br />The first half of the novel carefully unfolds the plot, as Dr. More first suspects things are amiss, then begins connecting the dots, all the while being watched and wooed by the project's architects, who try to recruit Dr. More by challenging him to show what's inherently wrong with a macro-solution to society's woes. The second half of the book moves rapidly, surging ahead like the nail-biting pirogue trip downriver to rescue the children. The action continues as Dr. More shoots down (figuratively) the various arguments presented by Dr. Comeaux or Van Dorn.<br /><br />Ultimately, Walker Percy has forged here a strikingly unconventional means for debating the philosophical ramifications of meddling with free will, the individual's right to make good or bad choices, to live in happiness or in depression, to succeed or fail on one's own merits. We need to fight for our own happiness and our own rights, he might argue, to enable us to keep at bay the darker tendencies of human nature.<br /><br />Walker Percy's prose is, as always, fine, rich, precise. Percy rarely embellishes beyond what is needed, yet he can render a dead-on depiction of how people really talk, think, even move. His minor characters are not jolting or decorative, though many are eccentric, and his love of the Louisiana landscape permeates the outdoor settings.<br /><br />One reading will not suffice to coax the ideas and observations from \\"The Thanatos Syndrome.\\" Perhaps here, though, are some of the questions we need to ask in a time when genetic customization, \\"me-first\\" socialization, and symbolism dominate the cultural landscape; when mercy killing is legal in two European countries (so far); and terrorists and fundamentalists vie for control of our free will and civil liberties.ramifications of meddling with free will, the individual's right to make good or bad choices, to live in happiness or in depression, to succeed or fail on one's own merits.

The more general goal, perhaps not stated, is to broaden the influence of those standards so they encompass more of the medical publishing community.<br />The book, developed by a committee of writers, editors, and publishers, is organized around five major categories, Preparing an Article for Publication, Style, Terminology, Measurement and Quantitation, and Technical Information. Each of these categories is, in turn, broken down into chapters that probe various aspects of each category. Finding information is easy, and the writers have used examples generously to make the points clear.<br />The first section, Preparing an Article for Publication, is, naturally slanted more toward authors and those who toil to prepare authors manuscripts for publication. There are many guidelines offering advice that ranges from preparing the abstract to preparing any of six different types of acknowledgments. Editors and copy editors would do well to review this chapter as well. The section on citing Web sites alone is crucial reading.<br />I suspect, but cannot prove, that many researchers will not read deeply beyond the opening chapter, feeling that the remaining sections are more the province of copy editors and journal editors. Perhaps there is some merit to that line of thinking, but all authors in the medical sciences would benefit from the copious advice here, and the better writers, Im sure, do follow the principles of grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and usage set forth in the section on style. Common mistakes, such as confusing case and patient, redundancies, and the ever so ticklish topic of race/ethnicity are some of the many points discussed thoroughly.<br />The section on terminology is so mind-bogglingly detailed that all one can hope to do is remember that the AMA Style Guide will almost always have the answer if you have a question about an abbreviation (how many times is something mistakenly called an acronym instead of an initialism?), medical nomenclature (a huge chapter that is the heart of the book), or eponyms (which, thanks to this guide may now be a topic we can quit haggling over).<br />Measurement and Quantitation continue to be a bane for many writers and editors, though without delving too much into specifics, lets say that this section will answer most questions but not without careful reading and perhaps a look at the Chicago Manual of Style for a bit clearer presentation on this topic. The chapter on statistics, unique to this guide, notes how to express confidence intervals, confirms that the word Student in Student t test is capitalized (sorry, but this text editor on Amazon.com does not display the italic t), provides a list of statistical symbols and abbreviations, and offers valuable tips about displaying equations. And those examples barely hint at the wealth of information here.<br />A final section on technical information provides a thumbnail guide to good layout and design of printed materials, worthy sets both of copyediting marks and proofreading marks (which are no doubt often photocopied and posted in a visible location), an excellent primer on how to edit hard copy, and a glossary of publishing terms.<br />If you are a medical writer or editor, odds are that you already either have a copy of this guide or you borrow one from a colleague. If you are an aspiring medical communicator, you will need your own copy so you can mark in it, attach tabs, and leave open on your desk.ogy is so mind-bogglingly detailed that all one can hope to do is remember that the AMA Style Guide will almost always have the answer if you have a question about an abbreviation (how many times is something mistakenly called an acronym instead of an initialism?), medical nomenclature (a huge chapter that is the heart of the book), or eponyms (which, thanks to this guide may now be a topic we can quit haggling over).<br />Measurement and Quantitation continue to be a bane for many writers and editors, though without delving too much into specifics, lets say that this section will answer most questions but not without careful reading and perhaps a look at the Chicago Manual of Style for a bit clearer presentation on this topic.

This venerable, thorough guide to editing and writing may be getting a bit dated, yet it remains an indispensable reference for serious editors and writers in nearly all disciplines.<br />Two main attributes---its organization and its completeness---make this reference so valuable. For example, chapter 5, a treatise on the pleasure and pain of punctuation, starts with the various forms of terminal punctuation before moving into a substantial discussion on the comma (there are more than 20 subpoints discussed on the uses of the comma) and concluding with a roundup of the remaining commonly used marks of punctuation. It's easy to find out the distinction between, say an en-dash and an em-dash, or get a definitive answer about why we need to include serial commas (despite the outdated advice offered by the badly out-of-step AP Style Manual).<br />The advice about names and terms found in chapter 7 seems daunting at first, but the presentation is, again, so well-organized and complete, that, after some study, you will start catching all the errors that make their way into too much printed material these days. The advice here about when to capitalize words such as \\"federal,\\" \\"government,\\" or \\"state\\" trumps the misleading, confusing dictums of other outmoded texts such as the United States Government Printing Office Style Manual.<br />One more example of why the Chicago Manual of Style is a beacon of calm authority can be found in the common sense approach to the difficult issue of being consistent in the use of numbers. Nothing drives me crazier than fighting with a manager, copy editor, or researcher about the use of numbers. Here the emphasis is on laying on the general principles not as absolute rules but as guidelines followed by a generous overview about the myriad exception and variations to these principles. Numerous examples cover virtually all the situations one might encounter.<br />Any new copy editor worth his or her salt will have highlighted practically the whole second chapter on copyediting; veterans will return here frequently, too. Both will likely have, at some point, thumb tacked or taped a photocopy of Figure 3.1 Proofreaders' Marks within easy viewing distance.<br />Detailed discussions about references and bibliographies, indexing, marking manuscripts, and copyright law (though this is one place where the book is beginning to show its age, for the impact of the Internet on copyright matters was not foreseen when this book was published) round out this reference. Sections on foreign languages, scientific terms, and mathematics in type illustrate further why this book anchors the writer-editor's reference collection.<br />I eagerly wait for the 15th edition to be published.e myriad exception and variations to these principles.

Books	3	1	1	N	N	"Nothing ever goes away"	Apparently this quote from Barry Commmoner was correct. Where on earth did Byrne find some of this stuff?<br />There are dozens of well-known compilations of quotations, and hundreds of lesser known ones. This book tends more toward the humorous or cynical side than the more serious collections such as Bartlett's or the Penguin Dictionary of Quotations. And though those two volumes belong on any professional writer's collection, it's a toss up whether you need these 1,911 quotes, especially given how mean-spirited many of these quotes are.<br />For instance, we have Bhagwhan Shree Rajneesh noting, \\"Jesus was a crackpot.\\" Or Leo Tolstoy opining \\"Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal,\\" a quote the author was so fond of that he included it on at least four different pages. Of course, there are those moments when material of this ilk fits the bill.<br />One big strike is that the book is not that easy to use. You have to rely on the indices to find quotes by either the person's name or by topic. Then, the topics sometimes do not seem, in my estimation, to match the quotes. The author also saw fit to cram a bunch of his own quotes throughout the text. Oddly, he didn't bother checking with you or me to see what wit we might have dispensed.<br />If you run across this book used, find one in the remainders section, or see a discarded copy on a city bus, you may wish to snare it. Otherwise, you can do just as well with some of the Web sites that provide quotes. (Incidentally, I think 2 and a half stars might be a more accurate rating.)	2002-03-26

The author, Stefan Gabanyi, spent two, no doubt wonderful years researching this excellent guide to the various brands and types of the world's great whisk(e)y.<br />He explains the spelling by noting that the Scots, Canadians, and Japanese prefer whisky, the rest insert the \\"e\\" into whiskey.  Gabanyi arrays the information alphabetically from A to Y---it seems no whisk(e)y begins with the letter \\"z\\"---and offers a concise but thorough distillation about the history, quality, and related information on the brands. He offers enough details about how the number, and to some extent the quality, of the various brands has diminished through the inevitable predatory consolidation, the bane to all things distinct and original.<br />Reproductions of the labels and other clever illustrations round out the guide and add to the pleasure from pursuing these page. I especially liked the quotations that precede each section, too.<br />This is truly a book to \\"sip.\\" You will not read it in one or even several sittings, but you will enjoy pulling in out as you relax by the fireplace or back porch, a glass of your own favorite whisk(e)y within easy reach.	2002-03-20

Rather Spengler grasps the tiger by the tail, so to speak, revealing the myriad therapies he sought, often in vain, to quell his sometimes nearly crippling back pain. He interweaves these experiences with biting, funny depictions of how this new Lord rules his life, affecting his work, recreation, family, and love life.<br />Spengler eschews self-pity for irony and insight, and when he finally hits upon a \\"therapy\\" in---of all places, a Texas honky-tonk---that helps his low back pain,  his nearly deadpan delivery of the culture clash he experiences will have you howling with laughter.<br />Tapping into vignettes that offer insights history, art, medicine, philosophy, politics, language, and whatever else he targets in his laser beam of dense, moving prose, Spengler informs and entertains.<br />I would offer a tip of the hat to his excellent translator, Philip Boehm, who rendered this English version, all the while remaining transparent and detached, as a true translator should.	2002-03-20

The histories, guides, and lists that span the opening section should not be regarded merely as the arcane turf of lexicographers and linguists. For the most part, these are great resources worth your attention. Likewise, there are appendices that delve into such varied subject matter as foreign words and phrases, chemical element, geographical names, and a style guide.<br />Do not be misled by the fact this volume is called a collegiate dictionary. It is also the dictionary favored by legions of copy editors charged with maintaining consistency and correctness in myriad publications of all sorts, from newspapers to newsletters. This dictionary has always been the most responsive to changes in the language, and each new edition swells by thousands of new entries. The standard features are all here of course: bold-face entries, pronunciation, economical but precise definitions and usage examples, and all the other details you need. In addition to the small, inset line drawings that grace every few pages, there are occasional half-page illustrations that expand certain terms.<br />Sure there are going to be some errors that pundits and nitpickers will gleefully cite, but it you consider the how much information is packed into this hardback edition (I would never buy a paperback dictionary)...you can do no better.	2002-02-27

This tenuous link to a much earlier time, the time of the tobacco wars that rocked rural Kentucky and Tennessee just before WWII, provided me with just a sliver of insight to the hard times Robert Penn Warren depicts in his first novel, Night Rider.<br />The protagonist, Percy Munn, is an affable but pliable young lawyer, happily married with a growing law practice when he is drawn into supporting \\"The Association,\\" an ardent band of tobacco farmers, including doctors, politicians, and other men whom \\"Perse\\" admires and who in turn admire him for his oratory skills, leadership, and status. Percy, himself a tobacco farmer, and the association work to break the economic monopoly exerted by the big tobacco companies (those bastards were evil well before they started lying to the public about the addictive nature of their deadly products). But when legal and ethical means are not enough, the collective leadership starts down a slippery slope of coercing nonassociation members to join or else face the consequences. Bands of \\"night riders\\" fan out across countryside, first destroying the crops of those who refused their entreaties to join up, then property, until even the taking of human life is justified as a means to their end once they have made the decision to torch the tobacco warehouses in Bardsville and the other towns in the vicinity.<br />Percy Munn finds himself at the center, and as other men whom he admired peel off from The Association because their moral bearing will not allow their continued participation, Percy eventually finds himself cut off from his wife; men such as Capt. Todd whom he greatly admired; Lucille Christian, the woman who tries to save him from himself; and eventually the leaders of The Association who let him take a fall for something he did not do.<br />The story is properly characterized as a tragedy even though Percy Munn is not as noble a central figure as one might expect. His great weakness is that he attaches himself to causes without much thought of the consequences. In other words, he is an idealist, but a flawed one. Though Percy's fall is in part caused by his flaws, a series of betrayals---sometimes he is the betrayer and other times he is betrayed---also conspire against him. When loyalty becomes more a currency than a principal, tragedy is inevitable.<br />Robert Penn Warren captures the speech and mannerisms of this main characters effectively, but he does not develop three-dimensional characters, with the exception of Willie Proudfit, the hard-scrabble, nearly destitute farmer who is something of a mystic who lives life fully and with a fervor Perse cannot experience as he continues his spiral inward. The landscape and settings seem more like those rendered by wood cuttings rather than a photograph. Some of Robert Penn Warren's digressions meander for pages without bolstering the story, and at times the allegorical and naturalistic elements of the novel seem at war with one another.<br />If permitted, I might rate this novel three and a half stars. Reading Night Rider is a worthwhile book for wintertime reading, butit is not the finest work by the author who was to become the first Poet Laureate of the United States.; and eventually the leaders of The Association who let him take a fall for something he did not do. <br />The story is properly characterized as a tragedy even though Percy Munn is not as noble a central figure as one might expect.

This text purports to offer expert advice on letters, proposals, presentations, and more. It does deliver average tried and true tricks but whether this advice is \\"expert\\" is debatable. The information on writing memos and letters provides generally useful advice about white space, headings, and using simpler words.<br />But the advice provided on more in-depth issues, such as cutting the length of sentences, is limited. For instance, to cut the length of sentences, one is to look for compound sentences (find the conjunctions), and break the sentences into components. More useful advice about collapsing ideas into dependent clauses or eliminating redundancy is not discussed in detail or illustrated.<br />The advice about using a variety of fonts and boxes could cause inexperienced writers to go astray and litter documents with visual clutter that will distract from the message. Worse is the lack of any real solid advice on using graphs and charts. The examples are cluttered and offer some of the worst elements of visual design such as hard-to-follow legends, pie charts that consume paper and ink but yield little information, and a hopelessly confusing figure.  A suggestion to use \\"a strategically placed red bar\\" runs counter to business etiquette of remembering that quite a few people suffer from some degree of color blindness.<br />One of the better parts of the book, Enlightening Letters, does provide easy to adapt examples of simple business letters intended to help solve simple problems. Likewise the chapters on proposals and reports will help the neophyte up to a point.<br />Still, there is enough OK advice scattered through the book to make it a useful low-level introduction to business writing. Keep in mind that all corporate cultures vary, too, and assessing what is acceptable in your workplace will still be essential. My advice is to keep this book in your desk drawer when needed or read it at home. You'll learn more by examining the work of the seasoned pros down the hall and picking their brains over lunch (and consider picking up the tab).more by examining the work of the seasoned pros down the hall and picking their brains over lunch (and consider picking up the tab).	2002-02-11

By the time the third novel ends, with a somewhat unsatisfactory fast forward jump across nearly five decades, one's nerves and emotions are practically wrung out.<br />These two young men, each traveling through the Southwest on quests that conjure up perils matching those Odysseus faced, are forced into choices with graver consequences than either can foresee. Their independent quests, which form the basis of All the Pretty Horses and The Crossing, intertwine in Cities of the Plain. Death is no stranger in any of the three books, but by the end of Cities on the Plain, it is irrelevant.<br />Though much has been written about the two central characters and their fates, in my view, McCarthy tends to amplify his characters more than he develops them for there is a sameness to each from start to end more in keeping with archetypes than real people.<br />McCarthy will build the tension to an almost maddening level at times, relying on vivid, detailed depictions of the now lost Southwest to slow the momentum. At times I felt like I was waiting for an iceberg to scuttle my ship: I could see its slow approach but could not forestall the inevitable. The layers and layers of description finely permeate your consciousness so that the clouds of dust, the smell of sweaty horses, the ache from a knife puncture, cold rain sliding under the collar down the spine take on the vividness usually imparted more powerfully by poetry than prose.<br />Sometimes, I must confess, the clipped style of the conversations and stacks of similes bothered me a bit because of what was not being said or shown but what lurked unstated like those half-formed thoughts we all harbor.<br />Yet writing with this level of detail about the land, the weather, the loneliness of souls on a quest, can take its toll and for all the pleasure these books bring, I must confess that I was not sorry to close the cover and shelve this book. Maybe I'll revisit it in 20 years; regardless, these characters are forever seared in my consciousness.nfess that I was not sorry to close the cover and shelve this book.

He identifies the attributes of effective communication of information and then illustrates what works and why in very understandable terms.<br />For instance, in his chapter &quot;Layering and Separation,&quot; Tufte dissects the problems with array of marshaling signals then reworks the presentation and provides a step-by-step explanation of his process. His coining of the wonderful notion of an &quot;information prison&quot; shows that his cleverness extends from the visual to the written.<br />As Tufte writes in his introduction, &quot;The principles of information design are universal-like mathematics-and are not tied to unique features of a particular language or culture.&quot; He proves this point amply by drawing on myriad sources and examples.<br />His comments and insights of the power of color are especially enlightening, and if you have ever been subjected to a particularly hideous PowerPoint slide show where the presenter got more than a bit carried away with the technology, you will be agreeing more than disagreeing with the ideas here.<br />Finally, I acknowledge there is bound to be some sticker shock associated with Edward Tufte's books. But if you consider the amount and quality of color (which requires special press runs), the quality of the paper, the amount of press time (Tufte oversees and approves the printing), and the vast scope of timeless information contained in each book, then these books are a deal.	2001-12-18

That problem would make him smile no doubt. Philosopher, physician, scientist, and moralist, he brings remarkable depth to this parable of clinical depression set in a time when America has lost its greatness, perhaps from internal decay or perhaps external attack. There are passages here that strike home with too much realism since the horrors of September 11.<br />The protagonist, Dr. Tom More, sets out to restore balance to the human soul through his remarkable invention, the Ontological Lapsometer. But is this the quest of a madman or a savior?<br />There is an altogether too eerie prescience in the opening pages, and while one should not expect Nostradamus, consider these lines:<br />&quot;These are bad times.<br />&quot;Principalities and powers are everywhere victorious. Wickedness flourishes in high places.<br />&quot;There is a clearer and more present danger, however. for I have reason to believe that within the next two hours an unprecedented fallout of noxious particles will settle hereabouts and perhaps in other places as well.&quot;<br />Grab this book and fill your glass to the brim with crushed ice and whatever distilled spirit you favor.

The point is that Mr. Thompson drills deep into our collective gray matter with this potent account of the clash of the perception of what consensus American culture should be and the reality of that culture as seen through a drug-induced prism. The superb opening to this books has become a twisted Lord's Prayer for many of my generation, and the book serves as a crude psalmody for those on a crusade to ferret out the weirdness lurking just below the surface.<br />Sure some of this stuff is dated. It's 30 years old, for crying out loud. But it resonants because it is the real deal, a thrill ride that rivets you to the page as you fumble around for your next beer unwilling to break your gaze from the account of mayhem unleashed on Las Vegas.<br />Get the original cover if you can.

No longer did I have to sort through my various paperbacks to find a story I wished to reread. The convenience of having this material in one volume is a compelling reason to own this text.<br />Borges familiar themes of life, death, labyrinths, religion and mythology, mirrors, knife fights, South American revolutionary events and characters, libraries and art, epiphanies versus ignorance wind their way throughout these stories. Often you will begin in media res, which is well enough, but Borges will just as often end a story without resolving matters. His tribute to H.P. Lovecraft, \\"There Are Many Things,\\" leaves you wondering, for example.<br />Borges uses detail precisely, not excessively, and if, to borrow from Ezra Pound's comment on what makes for good poetry, the pace of these works is sometimes slow their density is undisputed. (If you want details, lots of details, then try Cormac McCarthy's novels. At times, they are exhausting to read-like running through knee-deep water.)<br /><br />I find that reading two or three stories at a time (excepting, of course, the extremely brief sketches) suffices, for you need time to linger, to ponder, and, if time allows, to reread passages, if not entire stories.<br />The excellent footnotes Andrew Hurley provides are, to me, another reason to own this work. This body of contextual, historical, and biographical information was elucidating, even fun, to read. (I used two bookmarks, one for the stories, one for the footnotes.)<br />Many reviewers quibble with the translation, and I leave that debate to those with much more knowledge about the merits of original Spanish version of these stories than I possess. I do, however, still wonder how the Nobel committees that snubbed Borges were able to rationalize their oversight.	2001-10-10

Some may quibble at Bate's occasional forays into speculation, particularly when he writes about Johnson's troubled childhood and how its events shaped his later life. Because Bate imposes such detail and rigor in his scholarship, however, it would be foolhardy not to think his depictions, even the speculative ones, as pretty accurate.<br />The physiological analysis of Johnson's character may strike some readers as heavy-handed, yet it ultimately illuminates the full character of Johnson, helping the modern reader to understand more clearly the time and culture that produced a character as complex and powerful as Dr. Johnson.<br />As I neared the end of this wonderful volume, I felt the same pangs one feels toward the conclusion of an excellent novel. Bate writes with such power, clarity, and insight that I cannot foresee any other biography of Johnson dislodging this one as the definitive rendering of his epic life.	2001-09-25
US	51067124	R6BXJUOYB0BSS	0805065016	900494208	Susan Laughs	Books	5	26	27	N	N	Charming Reality Check about Disabled Children	The author and illustrator have done a wonderful job with this show-and-tell story that details all the ways Susan is just like anyone else---until her \\"difference\\" is confirmed at the very end.<br />Obviously aimed at the younger readers, the book's subtle message could be lost on some of the small fry unless an adult spends a moment explaining to them what the real message of the story. I would love to know, too, how many adults can guess the ending. I suspect that unless they are the parents or caretakers of a disabled child, that they too may be surprised. I especially liked the pages showing Susan dancing with her granddad, getting in trouble, and playing with other kids.<br />Though concepts such as diversity and inclusion are relentlessly idolized today, the truth is children---and adults---with physical disabilities remain needlessly excluded through both physical and social barriers. In that regard, this gentle book, which can only help open doors for the disabled, is recommended reading for every person with a heart and mind. The best part is that it may change how you react next time you meet a child in a wheelchair.	2001-09-24

I rarely acknowledge any involvement of a publication from those dark BT days.<br />Tufte's masterful and dead-on takes about how to communicate statistical and quantitative data challenges standard assumptions about developing graphical information and reveals, though it is not his stated intention, the weakness of so many graphics software packages. Just look at his collection of chartjunk and &quot;ducks&quot; (his term for hideous graphics) to see how all the whistles and bells available to us via computer graphics programs actually obfuscate the interpretation of visual information. By the time you read how much ink and paper are wasted by created bad graphics, you should be a convert.<br />And if you are ever lucky enough to have the chance to attend one of Tufte's seminars, pawn your PC if that's what it takes.	2001-09-24
US	51067124	R4JF47ROWXGGH	188320531X	569812902	Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Read carefully	This text is the testament for the new creed of \\"light exercise\\" being heralded as the bringer of health and longevity. The idea is that \\"bouts\\" of exercise, accumulated throughout the day, will help engender improved health. Thate notion, on the surface, makes sense, but there is debate among the pundits in this field about the validity of this notion. Each chapter discusses in great detail the effects of physical activity on health.<br />Chapter 4, the core of the book, focuses on how exercise affects specific diseases, including heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, and mental health. The book also offers overviews an historical perspective, a look at patterns and trends of physical activity in chapter 4 (which may be the most lucid part of this part), and some great tables that are full of data. The sixth chapter lapses into the fuzzy, esoteric realm of health promotion, a somewhat dubious field full of pompous notions such as the \\"transtheoretical model,\\" the \\"relapse prevention model,\\" and the \\"theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior\\"---all of which are just mumbo jumbo for getting people off their butts and out exercising. One oversight is the lack of any information about how physical activity can benefit people with disabilities.<br />This book will not help PE teachers or gym rats in any way, but it is supposed to influence policy makers.<br />The layout is easy to read and each chapter is fully supported by lots of references. Most of the writing, save the chapter on promoting exercise, is clearly written, a testament, no doubt, to the work of the editors.	2001-09-12

He created a fantastic, exotic universe by mining the realms of possibility in &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep, then tried the same formula on &quot;A Deepness in the Sky.&quot; This prequel, though, never quite rises to the levels one expects. Some early clues of trouble include his having his protagonist Sherkaner Underhill, the main &quot;spider-like&quot; creature, driving a car around what sounds like highway 101 in California. The image does not strike one as realistic, even in this speculative setting. He also creates villians who remain just cardboard cutouts, never achieving the stature one expects. The only character---including the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; ones---whom I can still recall with much clarity a few months after reading this work, is Pham Nuwen, and I suspect we have not heard the last of him.<br />The plot struggles against conflicting goals: Vinge wants to present an epic tale encompassing decades of time yet infuse the book with enough action to keep the reader engaged. Those among the legions of Vinge's fans will no doubt disagree with this assessment. Those new to his writing be warned: this book gets tedious and the payoff is not all that satisfying.	2001-09-12

There is not enough detail or practical advice on rewarding or motivating your dog, understanding individual temperments, or picking a trainer to work with. Indeed, much of the book reads like a template where the primary difference, besides the photos and breed history, between this book and any other dog-training guide would be the words \\"insert breed name here.\\"<br />If you are interested in owning and training an Aussie, please first review the material at Aussierescue.org. Aussie are clever, playful, and engaging. If you own one, you know what it is like to have your dog watch you and to have an silent furry shadow underfoot.	2001-08-29
