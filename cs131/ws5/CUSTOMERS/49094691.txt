In \\"Notes from a Small Island,\\" he captures the experience of Great Britain, his own unique journey through it, and his own personality equally well.  He doesn't infuse the book with so much of himself that it becomes annoying, but just enough to give it character and an honest-to-goodness perspective.<br /><br />Bryson writes with a sharp wit that is seldom absent, and it's hard to read this book without wanting to laugh out loud and annoy those around you by reading short passages of it to them.  He points out some of the absurdities of Great Britain and its people, but is equally unafraid to turn that razor wit against himself and point out that he is no less absurd at times.  It's Bryson's sense of humour that makes this book so eminenetly entertaining, the sort of wit that most writers wish they could attain.<br /><br />Even so, Bryson has his serious moments too, and he uses them to showcase the Britain he knows and loves in all its understated glory. He's got an admirable eye for detail and an obvious love for the history of the British Isles, and these things exude from every chapter of the book.  In his travels across the United Kingdom, Bryson seems to prefer the small places, the places nobody goes much or talks about, places like Weston-super-Mare and Durham and John o'Groats and Bournemouth, and he gives we the readers a delightful look into some of the nooks and crannies in each of these places.  To be sure, he visits some of the big cities as well, like Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London of course...but his affections clearly lie in the out-of-the-way places, the ones that maintain a sense of their history and their character.<br /><br />It seems to me that \\"Notes from a Small Island\\" is an ideal book for both those who have lived in Great Britain and those who have never even been there.  For the former, Bryson provides a unique perspective and a clear love for the country, which any resident should be able to appreciate.  For the latter, his salient and funny points will help steer you in surprising directions, one which your average tour book wouldn't be able to recommend.<br /><br />I myself purchased \\"Notes from a Small Island\\" while in London, on a two-week holiday in Great Britain with my family.  I waited a while after I got back to read it, and when I finally did pick it up I found that it made me yearn to go back even more than I already was.  Bryson's descriptions of the land and the people, all the idiosyncracies that makes Great Britain what it is, and his sense of humour throughout the book, made me miss that place mightily.<br /><br />It makes me want to go back and see it all again...but this time, like he did.he former, Bryson provides a unique perspective and a clear love for the country, which any resident should be able to appreciate.

Both authors are funny, irreverent, often shocking, intelligent, sharp as a tack and with the same sting. Their books are original, addictive and challenging, their imaginations are fertile and always active, and their signature style gives them away every time.<br /><br />\\"Haunted\\" is a book that cemented this idea for me, the idea that our dear Chuck is really Kurt Vonnegut in modern clothes.<br /><br />\\"Haunted\\" is a framing story, several stories wrapped in one larger story, which all tie together at the end. If you've been paying attention at all lately, there are lots of stories like this around. Quentin Tarantino does it in most of his movies, and Neil Gaiman does it in comics, most notably the Sandman series. The concept isn't original, but the way it's done in \\"Haunted\\" is pure Chuck, and I don't think anyone could have pulled it off like he did.<br /><br />The main premise of \\"Haunted\\" is a \\"writer's retreat,\\" where several self-proclaimed writers agree to abandon their lives for three months and spend that time locked in a theatre, away from the world, to let them focus on their work and write their masterpiece. While at the retreat, they go by sort of code-names, like Miss America or Agent Tattletale or Saint Gut-Free. The only way we get hints of their true names, as well as the nature of their code names, is when they tell their stories.<br /><br />The stories of each character comprise a large portion of the book. Each character gets at least one story and one poem, and a couple characters get more than that. The stories themselves represent a wide range of experiences, from the quirky to the downright nasty. The famous story \\"Guts\\" is here, the one Chuck reads aloud at his signings while his audience members leave the room to be sick, and at least a few others that might engender similar reactions. Each one is great fun to read, and each one ties in quite nicely, in its own way, with the overall story that continues in parallel to the short character vignettes.<br /><br />Perhaps the only weakness of the book is that the voice of each story is essentially the same. For the most part, each story reads like the same person wrote it. Not to put too fine a point on it, but they all read like a Chuck Palahniuk story -- he just can't seem to get away from his own style. To really make this concept fly, giving each story its own voice would have been the icing on the cake. Still, it's a minor issue, and with tales as brilliant as \\"Civil Twilight\\" and \\"Product Placement,\\" it's hard to care much about the voice because the stories are just that good.<br /><br />\\"Haunted\\" is also a work of metafiction, it's a story about storytelling and the process of spinning tales. You're never really sure, while reading, whether the stories told by the characters are meant to be life histories or total invention (or, as I suspect, some of each). Part of the fun of the story is seeing how some stories seem to leak into the larger narrative, and vice versa. Even the last story, clearly a flight of fancy in many ways, has something to tell us about how the framing story ends. With \\"Haunted,\\" more clearly than in any of his other books, Chuck seems to be dealing directly with his own craft, and exploring just what it means to tell the kinds of stories he tells.<br /><br />When I bought \\"Haunted,\\" it was at a reading Chuck gave in downtown Seattle. He did not read \\"Guts\\" but he did read an equally nasty piece of work from the book, \\"Hot Potting.\\" He gave out large mats shaped like pieces of meat, and near the end he threw out dismembered hands and feet and arms and legs (latex, of course!) to the audience. He told delightfully wicked stories of people he'd met on the road and things they told him. Who knows if these were true, but who cares? The point is, what was clear at the reading is equally clear in the pages of \\"Haunted\\": here is a man wholoves what he does for a living. He writes what he wants to write, and people like me can't get enough of it. He has something to say, and again like Kurt Vonnegut, he's not going to flinch away from saying it his way.<br /><br />As for me, I find it delightful, refreshing, and great fun to read.is a man who loves what he does for a living.

Unfortunately, that's pretty much what reading \\"The Phoenix Egg\\" was like for me -- not a bad idea, but I couldn't help but find better ways to explore the premise of the book as I read. Word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, I found myself fixing spelling, puncuation, and phrasing to improve on the story overall. Too bad they didn't do this work before publishing it, to save me the trouble and let me enjoy the novel.<br /><br />It's not just misspellings, either -- though there are many of those throughout the book (you don't put airplanes in a \\"hanger,\\" for example), that's at least somewhat expected for a small publisher like this. The bad puncuation, while distracting, could also be forgiven somewhat. What really got to me, though, was the poor sentence structure and paragraph construction. On nearly every page, I found ways to rephrase a sentence or two to make it stronger, or to convey the idea better. Somehow, Bamberg finds ways to make even the most high-octane action seem bland and flavorless, and the love scenes, which are supposed to be revelatory, come off as trite and predictable. It's a problem of how he phrases things -- using too many adjectives when simplicity is called for, then hedging his words when more depth is needed. It almost seemed like he was working against the ideas he was trying to express, limiting his palette to only a few word constructions.<br /><br />I give him credit for a good idea, though. Even if it takes a while (almost half the book) to get there, the concept behind \\"The Phoenix Egg\\" is an interesting one, and could have been really enjoyable in the hands of a different writer. The plot, too, was fairly well structured, if imperfectly so. The book starts out at a running gallop and never really lets up much, with a great deal of action and suspense strung out before we even have an idea of what's going on. It works for the most part, though it did seem a bit far-fetched and frustrating to me how little there was to learn about the impetus behind all the action until much later. And by then, it was a little bit anti-climactic.<br /><br />It starts out fairly simply...Caitlin Maxwell's husband is killed and her life is also in danger, because of something he was working on that she doesn't know about. She enlists the aid of an old flame, John Blalock, to help her survive and find out just what her husband's secret was before the folks chasing her, organizations from all over the world, find it. Blalock, in the years he and Maxwell were separated, has become something of an expert in black ops and investigation...all very convenient for Caitlin, who has need of all of his talents before their adventures are over.<br /><br />The characters in \\"The Phoenix Egg\\" are on the thin side -- not as transparent as those from \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but pretty cardboard nonetheless. The plot runs fast and hard but doesn't really establish a good steady pace. And someone really needed to go through the book with a fine tooth comb and pick out all the mistakes and things that could have been done better. This is a book with a great deal of potential. It was frustrating, and more than a little disappointing, to see much of that potential squandered. I usually think that saying a book needed a better editor is something of a cop-out when rating a book's quality, but in this case, it really fits the bill.<br /><br />This could have been such a better book. As it stands, it reads more like a term paper, and I felt like the unfortunate grad student grading it.t works for the most part, though it did seem a bit far-fetched and frustrating to me how little there was to learn about the impetus behind all the action until much later.

Rowling's Harry Potter series, and for those who've read the previous five books, both her strengths and weaknesses as an author should be familiar territory. In general terms, not much is different about this book, so diehard fans will likely be pleased while critics will still have much to say against it.<br /><br />I find myself somewhere in the middle. Though I think \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" was my favorite, I've enjoyed each of the Harry Potter books, including this one. I really appreciate how Rowling creates characters that you can identify with and feel for. Most of her characters aren't cardboard cutouts, but careful portraits with depth and a sense of someone who could almost leap off the page. Her stories are increasingly intricate, involving more and more of the world outside Hogwarts (though she did seem to pull back from that a little in this book) and sub-plots abound. Her sense of humour is as present here as it ever was, with lots of little details that, while not adding much to the overall story, are very amusing in themselves. And her imagination, as always, is in high evidence here, suffusing the book with a sense of wonder that's good for all ages.<br /><br />Oddly enough, some of these strengths also lead to the weaknesses, when overplayed or used poorly. Her usually-strong characters make it easier to see the ones she has put there just to cast away again...these are the people who we don't get to know as well, whose motivations don't matter because they won't be around for too long, for one reason or another. The intricacy of the story has led to a lot of dead ends, and this is the case more and more as the series continues. If it's intentional, then it means Rowling is throwing out a lot of red herrings, and if it's not, it means she's going down a lot of blind alleys and we're following blithely along, the blind leading the blind. I started feeling this way about the fourth book, \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,\\" where the plots started to feel a bit too thick, the sidetracks many and without much point. The fifth book had even more times like this, whole chapters it seemed, so much so that I had a hard time getting through the book. And the same is true of this book. There are 200 pages or so right in the middle where some things are happening, but much of it is repititious of what has come before and not at all needed to further the story. Rowling still hasn't learned the lesson that, often, less is more. Quite the opposite, she seems to be packing each succeeding volume with more and more needless detail, while I'd rather she skipped the third or fourth description of two characters snogging in the common room and moved on with the story. It's funny, but it does get tiresome, and it doesn't serve the overall plot thread at all.<br /><br />Still, there's much here to enjoy, and the last 200 pages (where everything starts to happen in all of her books) make me want to keep reading. In this book, Harry learns a lot more about Voldemort, as he and Dumbledore join forces more than they ever have to get to the bottom of the Dark Lord's rise to power and to try to discover a weakness. Mysteries abound; a new and surprising Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is chosen, Harry learns the effect of strange new spells like Sectumsempra and Levicorpus, the discovery of what a Horcrux is leads Dumbledore and Harry closer to Voldemort's nature, and of course, the identity of the Half-Blood Prince is sought. By the end of this book, some things are resolved but much work remains for Harry, the future of Hogwarts is hazy, and clearly things are drawing to a close, one way or another.<br /><br />Another thing Rowling does well: she really knows how to leave her readers wanting more. At the end of each book, I am anxious to read the next one, and \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is no exception. Obviously, much of the sixth book exists to set things up for the seventh, and final, book in ther series. It should be, to say the least, interesting.things up for the seventh, and final, book in ther series. It should be, to say the least, interesting.	2005-08-27

The story lives on in the minds of those who have read and treasured it, long after the book itself is dust.<br /><br />\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a rich novel, in every sense of the word.  It is peopled with passionate characters, filled with the lush landscapes of a Barcelona and Paris overshadowed by war, carried by a plot overflowing with intricacies, and suffused with the full, rich language of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a story about books, about a particular book but also about the magic that books can evoke, as here: \\"I leafed through the pages, inhaling the enchanted scent of promise that comes with all new books.\\"  Only a true book lover can recognize and write about the scent of books that way, and this is very much a story by a lover of good books, for other lovers of good books.<br /><br />The story concerns a singular book; \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Julian Carax, and how it captures the attention of the narrator, Daniel, when he is only ten, after he discovers it in the mazelize haven of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  After falling in love with the book, he soon learns how a mysterious figure has stalked the streets and bookshops of Barcelona for years, burning any books by Carax that he can find.  Daniel makes it his mission, as he grows, to not only preserve the book that he loves, but to also find and read any other Carax novels he can uncover. The story that follows is full of dark twists and turns, family secrets are revealed and histories thought long-dead come to terrifying life once again. David's own story, as he searches for meaning in the story he is uncovering, becomes just as important, and his story and the story of Carax are told in parallel.  The conclusion of all of this is as satisfying as could be hoped for, dramatic and frightening and full of hidden danger.<br /><br />If \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" has any fault, it is that it may be a little too intricate.  While most of the side-stories told along the way fit in nicely with the main plot, there are a few that seem to meander a bit too long without much point.  Zafon tells these tangential tales with the same loving hand, and for the most part they are not a big distraction.  But for the concept of \\"stories within stories\\" to really work well, each layer should have meaning for the other layers, and that was not true all the way through here.<br /><br />Still, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a wonderful novel, tailor-made for those who treasure their books and the worlds the invite us into.  If it says anything to us, then it reminds us that words sometimes have a spirit, beyond the printed page, in the hearts and minds of those who love to read.  This is an important novel, for those of us who believe that words can have a life of their own.

US	49094691	R3KS146VOI8219	1932234039	597658856	Strangers	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Haunted Strangers	It seems like everyone in Hideo Harada's life is a stranger. His ex-wife, who agreed to a divorce because of the growing distance between them. His estranged son, who sides with his mother and barely speaks to Harada anymore. His colleague, with whom he works well but doesn't really know.<br /><br />And then there are his new acquaintances. The fragile, mysterious Kei, who lives in the same building he does and shows up at his door late one evening.  And the man he meets in a darkened theatre near where he grew up, the man who bears a striking resemblance to Harada's father, dead since Harada was twelve.<br /><br />When I first bought \\"Strangers,\\" I saw that it was touted as a ghost story on the cover, and I was concerned that it would ruin the surprise in the story.  Fortunately, I was mostly wrong.  It's not an obvious ghost story at the beginning, but from the first few pages, when screenwriter Harada becomes aware that he is alone in his apartment building at night, it has the feel of a good ghost story. This is a feeling which is built upon as the story progresses, gradually and subtly.  There are no \\"gotcha\\" moments, nothing which jumps out and declares itself as That Spooky Thing.  This isn't a book about shambling zombies or ghosts coming to attack you out of the television.  This is a story about creeping dread and the growing feeling that something, somewhere you can't quite see it, is just a little bit off.<br /><br />In terms of execution, overall it comes off very well.  Some of the dialogue may seem a little clunky (I suspect that this may be to do with the translation), but most of it works just fine.  The prose is spare and efficient, enough to convey the essentials and leave much up to the reader's imagination, which I prefer for a story like this one -- nothing is so frightening or poignant as that we we can imagine for ourselves. The story develops steadily and smoothly, with no real lags or rushed points.<br /><br />And as it develops, as Harada learns more about the things he is experiencing, we also come to see that it is a story about the distances we create between us.  This is a very modern Japanese ghost story, with modern themes and ideas that aren't just scary...they're more than a little bit sad, too.  The central tragedy of the book is that all of Harada's experiences are brought about by his own choices, and the consequences they have on the people around him.<br /><br />So, when you see the words \\"ghost story\\" used to describe this novel, don't think of shock-value scares or easy, predictable conclusions.  This is very much a book of building tension and ever-increasing unease, and very well done.  It may just make you look twice at the strangers you see around you, every day.Harada learns more about the things he is experiencing, we also come to see that it is a story about the distances we create between us.

It is more of a collection of vignettes encompassing about 13 years in the life of a modern family, snapshots of moments in which we come to know each family member, then see how they change as their story progresses.<br /><br />The most astonishing thing about the book is how Minot ties each piece together. For the most part, the \\"big\\" events in the life of the family happen outside the narrative itself, in the space between the snapshots we are given. We may experience these moments as a part of their memories, but we come to understand what they were and what their effect has been in a fractured flow of story.<br /><br />Minot's prose, as in all her books, is expressive but spare, an economy of words that leaves much up to the reader's interpretation.  She tells us just enough to know the family, to understand their quiet successes and their obvious failures, to see both the shape of the mask and what lies underneath it. She gives us the same kind of knowledge that we might have if they lived in a house down the street, a neighborly knowledge, not an intimate one.<br /><br />For the most part, this is a strong point in the book, but at a few points, Minot's style puts the reader at a distance when we might prefer a closer understanding of the feelings of each family member.  In a way, it's the same frustration one experiences when we know something has happened to a neighbor, but we don't know how to ask without seeming nosy or pushy.  Perhaps this was a deliberate choice on Minot's part, this enforced distance from her characters, but intentional or not, it was frustrating at times.<br /><br />Still, despite the occasional frustration, \\"Monkeys\\" is a well-rendered series of portraits of a modern American family, the foibles and wrinkles and soft tragedies that make up so much of the family landscape, and shape the people in it.  Minot's writing is a delightful and refreshing change from the self-indulgent, overwrought prose most modern novelists love to employ, and in these brief vignettes, and the implication of events occurring between one and the next, we are given the chance to observe the quiet act of disintegration that goes on around us every day.dulgent, overwrought prose most modern novelists love to employ, and in these brief vignettes, and the implication of events occurring between one and the next, we are given the chance to observe the quiet act of disintegration that goes on around us every day.	2005-06-25

It is well-written, in a simple, uncluttered style that  I found quite refreshing. It is one of the rare books in which an unremarkable, sometimes even unlikable character is given life and breath by the author in such a subtle way that you barely even see it happening...but by the end of the book you may just come to love \\"Smithy\\" Ide. It is an inspiring story, but in an understated way -- it doesn't (I think) seek to inspire, but it inspires anyway. It's not a \\"feel-good\\" story in the usual sense of the word, but it is a story that makes you feel good while you're reading it, and while you're thinking about it after you're done reading...which you will.<br /><br />Within the first 60 pages of \\"The Memory of Running\\" Smithy Ide's parents are both killed in a car accident, we learn that Smithy himself is overweight, an alcoholic, and not exactly a people person, and his sister Bethany, who he has not seen for many years, has also died in California.  Smithy is confused, depressed, and begins to really lose himself (as he has done before) in beer and screwdrivers, when he finds his old Raleigh bicycle in his parents' garage. The tires are flat, the headlight on the front has no batteries, and he's outgrown it in more ways than one...but he gets on and starts riding.  He leaves behind only the detritus of his parents' lives, a job he doesn't like, and the regrets that have piled up all his life.<br /><br />The journey that Smithy embarks on isn't a particularly exciting one. The most excitement to be found in these pages is early on, when Smithy is coasting down a huge series of hills and his brakes fail, and he careens out of control through a baseball field. We spend much of the time with Smithy in his head, reliving memories of his mother and father and his troubled sister Bethany, and we slowly learn why Smithy is the way he is.<br /><br />Smithy's journey is marked not so much by the places he passes through, but by the people he meets along the way.  We see all of them through Smithy's eyes, through the simple face-value understanding he applies to everything he experiences.  We also see, as the novel progresses, how he changes and how those changes affect his outlook. There are no trite \\"ah-ha!\\" moments of revelation in the book, because they aren't necessary.  Smithy's changes are gradual and natural, an extension of the journey he is taking and the life he has lived.  All of these elements are handled with a deft and subtle hand, making it look easy (although I'm sure it wasn't).<br /><br />What Ron McLarty his given us in \\"The Memory of Running\\" is nothing short of an American original. Smithson Ide is a uniquely American character, both in his failings and in his successes. He is expressed in simple terms, modern but universal.  You may not like Smithy much as the book opens, but chances are pretty good that you know him, or someone very much like him. Similarly, the book itself is uniquely American.  The story is one where place matters, because such a story could probably only happen in the wide open spaces of modern America -- tarnished, imperfect, jaded, but still essentially good.<br /><br />\\"The Memory of Running\\" is not a flashy book, and Smithy Ide is not a charming or intelligent or witty character, but both the book and the character win me over because they are honest. This is a novel that finds the truth at the heart of the fiction, and expresses it in terms anyone can grasp. Along Smithy's path through the heart of America, we find that the same path gives us an understanding of an American soul -- as the twists and turns and dead ends thrown in the path shape who we are and who we might become.<br /><br />A fine, extraordinary novel indeed.rstanding of an American soul -- as the twists and turns and dead ends thrown in the path shape who we are and who we might become. <br /> <br />A fine, extraordinary novel indeed.	2005-06-18

Unfortunately, it's also a book in which the details get lost in a confusing, and sometimes contradictory, set of occurrences.<br /><br />The book opens promisingly enough, in the heat of battle in World War II. The reader is promised a cross between \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"The Relic,\\" and here it is in the first 50 pages. Astute readers will also notice a strong similarity between this early part and the film \\"Predator\\" -- other than the setting, the two could almost be the same story.  Later in the book, the author throws in some of our other favorite movies, like smatterings of \\"Aliens\\" or hints of \\"Jurassic Park,\\" just to keep us guessing.<br /><br />The plot moves along briskly enough, but it never really engaged me on the right level. I never found myself anxious to get back to its pages to see what happened next, and in fact sort of dismissed the book when people asked me about it.  It has a fairly strong beginning, a frayed and disjointed middle, and an end which, while rushed and overly reliant on happy coincidence, does manage to tie together most of the loose plot points in a relatively satisfying manner.  Like I said, all the correct elements for a good book are in place, but \\"Jinn\\" still misses the mark.<br /><br />It might have been the cardboard cutouts for characters that did it for me, or the one-too-many contrivances used to carry the plot along, or the leaps of sudden insight that led the characters to just the right place at just the right time...but really, I think it was just the obvious way Delaney telegraphed his story.  Though I'm sure the ending was intended as a twist, I pretty much had it figured out from midpoint in the book, and my predictions nearly all came true.<br /><br />\\"Jinn\\" is one of those books with a great deal of potential, which only winds up realizing a small fraction of it. It's an OK book, a decent lazy summer read when everything else has been read and you're looking for some brain-candy. However...original, it's not.

A small, little-known book of a little over 200 pages, a book that can be read fairly easily in a single rainy afternoon, if one is so inclined.<br /><br />\\"The Pushcart War\\" is the story of a \\"little\\" war on the streets of New York, a war that begins between the old-fashioned pushcart peddlers selling their wares at the sides of the street, and the oversized trucks which are bullying their way into more and more of the available space on the road. It starts with the destruction of a single pushcart by an angry truck driver, but escalates into multiple campaigns, strategies, and political countermeasures as the story goes on. The memorable Pea-Shooter campaign, the Peanut-Butter Speech, the Tacks Tax, the Raid on Maxie Hammerman's, the Portlette Papers, the Capture of the Bulletproof Italian Car, the Truce, the Peace March, the War of Words, and the Battle of Bleecker Street are only a few of the notable moments of the progression of the war, which eventually involves most of the citizens of the city, and becomes known by national and even international figures, including a movie star and the President of the United States.<br /><br />So many books for children have a tendency to take themselves and the morals they espouse so seriously, but fortunately \\"The Pushcart War\\" is not one of those books. While it does have a point to make, it makes it with light heart and always with a good sense of humor. The story of the struggling pushcart peddlers and the bullying trucks becomes a miniature view for all conflicts between an oppressive groups and their chosen victims, and the lesson is that anyone can find a way to fight back, no matter how the odds are stacked against them. The ideas of civil disobedience and equal rights, as well as the essentially silly but potentially harmful nature of politics, are all expressed here.<br /><br />However, these themes are only the backdrop of the story, which is above all else infectiously entertaining and irresistible. Despite a gap of nearly 20 years between my original reading of it and my recent one, I find it is a story which has stuck with me through the years, one which I cannot forget. The characters (Frank the Flower, Harry the Hot Dog, and General Anna among them) are quickly but not hastily drawn, and live and breathe as though plucked off the very streets of New York City. The situations presented are ridiculous in their way, but compelling and funny. And of course, the story of the little guy's fight against the big guy is appealing to every child, and to most adults.<br /><br />\\"Don't be a truck.\\" Take a few hours and allow yourself to be drawn into \\"The Pushcart War.\\"  I don't know if you'll treasure it the way I have come to, but I'm sure you'll find it a rewarding experience. This story of crackpots and campaigns, of trucks and tacks, of politics and pea-shooters and pushcarts, is a charming, light-hearted story which never lets the message overshadow the telling of the tale. This is a story children and adults can read and both will get something special from it.

US	49094691	R3DY9M8XP6OYLF	0399150978	476868297	Idlewild	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Sharp, original, and fun	The first 20 or 30 pages of \\"Idlewild\\" frankly had me wondering if I should bother reading the rest of the book. The characters and situations seemed just a bit fake, and the early premise seemed trite. Now, having stuck it out and read the whole book, I think that was intentional. The odd beginning sets up expectations for the reader early on, and then the story carries on to improve upon itself almost constantly. By the end, I was left fairly impressed and pleased with a book I hadn't been sure I wanted to finish at all.<br /><br />\\"Idlewild\\" is a story of some gifted kids living a mostly virtual existence, a world they can shape to meet their own needs and whims, and in which they can't ever really be hurt.  It is in this virtual world where they receive their education and are protected.  That is, until one of them is hurt in a power surge and loses all of his memory.  The rest of the book consists of Halloween, the protagonist, rediscovering who he is through his interactions with the other students, his parents, his virtual Nanny, and the virtual instructor Maestro. As he discovers more about himself, he also discovers more than he ever knew about the world in which he exists, and why he's there.<br /><br />Sagan does a nice job of creating different worlds in \\"Idlewild,\\" peeling back each layer of reality like the layers of an onion, keeping the readers always a little uncertain about the meaning of what's going on. While the story of Halloween and the other students is the main focus of the novel, there is another story that runs parallel to it, one which doesn't really become clear until halfway through the book. By the time I understood what was going on, I was hooked into the story and anxious to see how it came out.<br /><br />Sagan's writing isn't great, but it is serviceable with moments of true talent. The characters, seeming a little flat early on, are given life and depth as the story progresses, and evolve beyond their stereotypes. The prose is mostly transparent and unpretentious, allowing the story to spin out naturally, a style which works nicely.<br /><br />When I read that Nick Sagan was the son of the late astronomer and writer Carl Sagan, I wasn't sure what to think.  I was pleased to find that Nick has at least made the attempt to forge ahead in some original territory, unlike what his father wrote of in his fiction or scientific work. Even better, Nick's  attempt was laregly successful, and has resulted in a fun book that's an easy read but not a shallow one.  The ideas are thought-provoking and original, the story is entertaining and will keep you turning the pages.  Not bad at all for a first-timer.is mostly transparent and unpretentious, allowing the story to spin out naturally, a style which works nicely. <br /> <br />When I read that Nick Sagan was the son of the late astronomer and writer Carl Sagan, I wasn't sure what to think.

US	49094691	R3DUXFY1PPXSXK	B0002D6CMU	289512427	The Cave	Books	5	6	8	N	Y	Form and function, light and shadow, reality and illusion	\\"The Cave\\" opens with an excerpt from Plato's Republic, specifically from what is usually known as The Allegory of the Cave: \\"What a strange scene you describe, and what strange prisoners. They are just like us.\\"<br /><br />Though it is hard to see as the novel opens, this quote sets the stage for everything that is to come.  Deceptively simple and straightforward at the beginning, by the time I reached the end I found \\"The Cave\\" to be an immensely rewarding novel, very thought-provoking and as rich in original ideas as any of Saramago's other books.<br /><br />In terms of story, \\"The Cave\\" is about an aging potter named Cipriano Algor, his daughter Marta, and her husband Marcal. Early on in the book Cipriano receives the news that the Center, where he has been selling his earthenware plates and jugs, is no longer interested in purchasing his goods. He is told that consumers now prefer plastic wares, and the work of his hands is no longer profitable. Cipriano takes this news understandably hard, but he and his daughter Marta decide to try making clay figurines to sell, an idea which the Center is willing to test. They order over a thousand of the small figurines, and suddenly Cipriano's life sems to have purpose again. As the story continues, a lost dog is found, new love begins to blossom, and a new life begins to grow.<br /><br />As simple as this story seems at the beginning, I should have known better. I've read Saramago before, and I know that his stories are rich with ideas and imagination, and everything tends to mean something. In his other works, such as \\"Blindness\\" or \\"The Stone Raft,\\" the big idea behind the story was posed right up front, almost from the first page. In \\"The Cave,\\" the ideas of the story are under the surface until the very end, constantly present, but revealed in only tiny hints and suggestions, subtle wordplay and fragments of thought which must be assembled at the end. When we get there, despite the simplicity of the beginning, the conclusion is dramatic and inescapable...perhaps even revolutionary.  It is as near to a perfect ending as any I have ever read.<br /><br />While developing these ideas, Saramago keeps us interested with warm characters who we can truly understand and feel for. They have depth, charm, humor, and heart. Saramago's descriptions of their conversations are well-crafted, and he creates as much depth with what they do not say as with what they say.  Nobody is simple in this story, and even the dog is important. I came to care about them, their simple life, their everyday decisions. Though it is the ideas which impressed me at the end of the book, it is the characters which made me want to continue reading.<br /><br />I've said it before, reading a Saramago novel should not be a light undertaking. A summer beach novel or light bedtime reading this is not. In both style and content, Saramago's books are challenging stuff. A page or more of text can pass with no paragraph breaks, dialogue lacks the usual markers like quotation marks and line breaks, punctuation is irregular. Somehow, despite these stylistic oddities, Saramago makes it all work, and a rich story comes together from the threads he weaves. As challenging as this book may be to read, like his other novels, in the end, the result is well worth the extra effort. Like a clay pot shaped by the rough, worn hands of a master craftsman, it is a piece to be admired and treasured.<br /><br />In the way Saramago has written \\"The Cave,\\" he clearly wants you to care about Cipriano and Marta and Marcal and all of the characters. And if you read it, so you shall. It is only through coming to know these people, their loves and annoyances, their fears and hopes, their limitations and their triumphs, that we can understand their story and why it is important. Pay attention to these simple people and their simple lives, because as you will see, it is important.

US	49094691	R8OW4ZWKJUY6A	0743267524	778315947	Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season	Books	4	4	4	N	N	By the Faithful, For the Faithful	Frankly, I read \\"Faithful\\" because I'm a diehard Stephen King fan, and I tend to follow all his work the way he follows the Red Sox. I trumpet his successes to anyone who will listen, and I look at his failures as an opportunity to do better next time. While I like the way King writes about baseball (most especially in his wonderful short story \\"Head Down\\"), I'm not particularly a baseball fan myself, and this is definitely a book by baseball fans, for baseball fans. More specifically, it's a book by Red Sox fans, for Red Sox fans.<br /><br />King pretty much nails the structure of this book in the early pages, when he describes the differences between his writing style and that of his partner, Stewart O'Nan. \\"Do I need to bother with all this in-game detail?\\" King asks himself at one point. \\"Probably not; O'Nan will have it.\\" And later, King expands a little bit on this: \\"Stewart's the brains of the operation, no doubt. He knows where all the fielders are playing at any given time, and who'll be covering second...in any given situation. I'm more of a from-the-gut kind of guy.\\"<br /><br />And indeed, King is absolutely right. Stewart O'Nan's contributions to \\"Faithful\\" outnumber King's (in a very rough estimate) by about two-to-one. O'Nan's portions often read like a play-by-play calling of key games, with a healthy dose of baseball stats thrown in for good measure. He definitely takes his baseball pretty seriously. He also is a huge fan, and he comes at this book from that perspective; that of a devoted fan who loves the game right down to the nitty-gritty of it.<br /><br />King is no less a devoted fan, but his contributions are less detailed.  His musings in the book can wander from the legendary \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" to the events of last night's nail-biter to the unfortunate treatment of the Red Sox by the press without much difficulty, and only rarely does King delve into the land of statistics.<br /><br />It makes for an interesting balance: two skilled writers, both looking at the same baseball team during the same season and keeping their fan diaries in their own way.  Neither contribution is less meaningful than the other; O'Nan's portions form the meat of the book, while King's provide much of the garnish. Both are key to expressing the fan's perspective.<br /><br />For myself, I enjoyed the personal touches more than I got into the play-by-play.  Some of this may be due to the fact that I already knew how the season ended (does anyone NOT know?), so I was less interested in the games themselves and more interested in the things that happened uniquely to O'Nan and King in their pursuit of capturing the fan's perspective. For example, O'Nan made a habit of going to batting practice prior to most of the home games, and in a few memorably funny passages he brought a big fishing net to help him catch the fly balls. I'm still uncertain whether this did him more harm than good, but the image sticks out in my mind. Another good moment for O'Nan was on the night when John Kerry (yes, that one) threw out the first pitch for a home game, and O'Nan was throwing balls back and forth with him, getting his signature for himself and another fan. These are the things that make baseball interesting to me -- the camaraderie, and the way it brings people together.<br /><br />King had some of those moments as well, though he had the distinction of being both a local celebrity and a devoted fan, and the book captures both sides. We get the absolutely thrilling description of King throwing out the first pitch of a game, and then getting blamed by a local paper after the Sox lose that game. A few pages later, there's the humbling description of King in a hotel room, in his underwear, wearing a David Ortiz t-shirt and a Red Sox ball cap, watching the latest game on television. Now that's a true fan. And when the last game of the ALCS was over and the Sox had beaten the Yankees in a record-breaking comeback, we get the sour, departing Yankee fans sniping at both King and the Sox: \\"Red Sox suck, and you suck too, Steve.\\" It didn't lessen his joy one bit...in fact, it probably magnified it. The burdens of celebrity.<br /><br />I bought \\"Faithful\\" expecting something different than what it is. I suppose I was hoping for a longer version of \\"Head Down,\\" that excellent King reflection on little-league baseball. Even so, I wasn't disappointed by the book at all. \\"Faithful\\" is just what it purports to be: an honest, personal account of two diehard fans during one season of one of the most infamous teams in baseball, a season that just happened to be the one where their faith and hope were finally rewarded. I came to understand the Red Sox and baseball in a way that I hadn't before, and while I don't think I'll ever appreciate it the way these guys do, I have certainly had my eyes opened a bit, and that's always a good thing. \\"Faithful\\" is a light, enjoyable read about one of America's most enduring pastimes, and what makes it so special for the devotees who stick with it year after year.<br /><br />Keep the faith, lads.  Because that's what you do.parting Yankee fans sniping at both King and the Sox: \\"Red Sox suck, and you suck too, Steve.\\" It didn't lessen his joy one bit...in fact, it probably magnified it.

It's called \\"Building Bridges\\" because King talk about bridges in his speech, specifically about the bridges that he believes can be built between popular fiction and so-called \\"literary\\" fiction.<br /><br />For King fans like myself, much of the material King discusses here will be familiar from his apocryphal history (the story of his wife retrieving the pages of \\"Carrie\\" from the trash is told here again), or from his book \\"On Writing.\\" Even so, hearing King talking about it in his own voice is charming and well worth the listen. He speaks with an open sincerity here, in loving words regarding his wife, and in proud words regarding his love for his chosen craft. There are funny moments that only King could pull off, like when he suggests to the audience that even though it isn't likely, the elevator they take to their hotel rooms might -- just might -- plummet down 30 floors. And there are disarmingly sweet moments, such as his explanation that while he didn't marry his wife Tabitha for her typewriter, he admits it was a factor.<br /><br />What comes through most strongly in this relatively short speech is King's love for the written word, and his respect for anyone who makes the effort to share in his craft. He gives credit to his fellow writers across the board, genre writers and literary writers alike, and he talks about good fiction being able to express the truth at the center of the lie.  If you're looking for a reason why King was given this award, look no further than this speech -- in King's simple, honest style, it eloquently expresses many of the reasons why King deserves the award, both in terms of his contribution to the world of words and his unabashed love for it.<br /><br />I may be a little biased, but I can't think of anyone who deserves the recognition more, and it made me smile to hear him talk about it.little biased, but I can't think of anyone who deserves the recognition more, and it made me smile to hear him talk about it.	2005-01-22

We've seen it recently in Harry Potter, but before that we saw it in Neil Gaiman's \\"Books of Magic,\\" in Susan Cooper's \\"Dark is Rising,\\" in C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles, and even earlier than that in Lewis Carroll's tales of Alice and her looking-glass world. It is perhaps to this last that Barker owes his greatest debt, but it is a common theme in literature, especially childrens' literature.<br /><br />What makes this story different is, quite simply, the fact that it's told by Clive Barker.<br /><br />Barker has long been a favorite writer of mine for the richness and depth of his imagination, and for the fantastic worlds he is capable of creating. From the horrors of \\"Weaveworld\\" to the depths of \\"Imajica\\" to the magic found in \\"The Thief of Always,\\" Barker is often a visionary without comparison. Some of his recent work does not live up to this potential, but his Abarat series is as bravely imagined as anything he's written.<br /><br />Just listen to the names he populates the world of the Abarat with: the people have names like Candy Quackenbush, Malingo, Christopher Carrion, Mater Motley, Finnegan Hob, and the Princess Boa. Places are named things like the Efreet and Babilonium and the Yebba Dim Day and the sea of Izabella. Creatures are named mantizacs and geshrats. Just Barker's names roll off the tongue in delightful combinations and spark the imagination.<br /><br />And the ideas -- if the names hint at a mystical world, the true magic lies in Barker's ideas. The Abarat itself is conceptually brilliant, a world in which time is place, and each hour of the day is represented by an island upon which it is always that time. The people of the islands go about their lives without experiencing time as we do, divided between day and night. For them, they always live at six o'clock in the evening, or at 10 in the morning, or at midnight. The only way to experience a different time is to brave the Izabella and visit another island. It's quite a concept to wrap your mind around, but it's incorporated into the story so well that it seems quite natural.<br /><br />And, oh, the illustrations. One mustn't ignore Barker's paintings in this book. He has spent years illustrating the books of the Abarat lovingly and profusely, and nearly every page has at least a morsel for the eyes to enjoy. Taken together, the illustrations of the Abarat are a visual feast, full-bodied, rich, and perfectly-suited to the depth of the story. Barker has long been a Rennaissance man of sorts, as both a writer and a painter, and it is a supreme pleasure to see both aspects of his work come together so brilliantly in the books of the Abarat.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this should be considered a very dark fantasy. While not nearly as graphic or brutal as Barker's \\"adult\\" fiction, the Abarat stories definitely have a dark edge and are probably a bit much for younger children. Older kids in their teens, though, should be able to fully enjoy the worlds of the Abarat without having nightmares about it later.<br /><br />Also, don't forget that this is the second book in the series. Candy's introduction to the Abarat and the chief players in this drama has already taken place in the first book, and what we see in this one are the further adventures as she learns more about this new world and its people, and how it all integrates with her own world -- our world, known to Abaratians as the Hereafter.<br /><br />Physically, \\"Abarat: Days of Magic, Nights of War\\" is a heavy, thick, weighty book, as befits its subject matter. Candy's journey -- like Harry Potter's and Will Stanton's and even young Alice's journey -- is one of discovery. As she discovers this new world and her place in it, she is also discovering things about herself that she never knew existed. It is the depth and courage of Barker's imagination that sets the book apart from others of this kind, giving readers of all ages a banquet of delights. This is no light fantasy fare to be nibbled and sampled, but a feast to be devoured fully, and savored for all the exotic flavors that it has to offer.<br /><br />Enjoy..

By contrast, Denny Martin Flinn packs his book with helpful, meaningful advice on what most budding screenwriters get wrong, and how to make it right. Within five minutes of looking at it, I found three things that were incorrect about how I had been formatting the screenplay I'm working on, and once I saw the problems, I could also completely see why doing it the right way made more sense for a potential reader.<br /><br />Flinn writes efficiently, with a no-nonsense style that I really found appealing. He's honest and he's clear, and he gets right to the point on why things work the way they do. Even better are the examples he's chosen: From \\"Alien\\" to \\"The Elephant Man\\" to \\"Lethal Weapon,\\" each of the script examples highlighted in the book is perfect for the point Flinn makes, and gives the reader a thorough grounding in what he is talking about.<br /><br />\\"How Not to Write a Screenplay\\" is divided into three main parts: \\"Form,\\" \\"Content,\\" and \\"Development.\\" \\"Form\\" is easily the longest and most in-depth section, taking up about two-thirds of the book, while \\"Development\\" (the stage which occurs after a screenplay is purchased and is being produced) is only a few pages in length. Clearly, Flinn wanted to emphasize the form of screenplay writing for this book, so readers looking for help with content or the development stage might do well to look to another book. Flinn himself makes no bones about what his book is about, as in the Introduction he states: \\"If you can avoid the faults I have collected here, you may not write a particularly good screenplay. But you won't write a bad one.  The rest is up to you.\\"<br /><br />In terms of the form of screenplay writing, this book is an invaluable resource to learn from. By showing the reader what not to do, he makes the resulting screenplay more readable to a potential producer, and thus more likely to garner the interest of the person reading it. In terms of content and development, the book is helpful in some ways, but the most helpful section is by far the first one. This book is ideal for a screenwriter who has a good idea and wants to have a go at it, but isn't sure how to get it right so that someone might actually read it. Flinn's advice will help that writer get it onto paper.<br /><br />Here's the skinny: this book gives its advice from the standpoint of a frequent reader of screenplays, and I already feel that it has made me a better writer of screenplays. I can't think of a better reason to give it a shot than that.e form of screenplay writing, this book is an invaluable resource to learn from.

US	49094691	RN6ALCPM64RF5	0446577081	734490734	Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia	Books	4	3	5	N	N	"For the Saudis...what is hidden does not exist."	You may have noticed this book because of the name of the author. To clear it up right away: yes, Carmen bin Ladin was once related to Osama bin Laden. She was married to Osama's brother Yeslam for many years, and met Osama several times, most of which are mentioned in this book.<br /><br />Carmen begins and ends with a reflection on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This changed her life as it did so many others, but it also had a unique effect of putting her in a spotlight, and in \\"Inside the Kingdom\\" she uses that spotlight to light the darkness of Saudi Arabian culture and its deplorable treatment of women. As a native of Western culture and a natural-born son of the freedoms we enjoy here, I found it hard to believe, at first, that a culture still exists that supports the subjugation of women so utterly. But in reading this book, I am forced to face the hard reality...and still, I am lucky. Carmen bin Laden had to live it.<br /><br />In this book, you will see what she saw, delivered in honest and open terms by her words. You will see what it's like to wear the abaya, the stifling black cloth that must cover everything, even the face, in public at all times. You will feel the frustration of being unable to talk to any man in public. You will understand the fear that comes from knowing that your husband could leave you childless and penniless at any time, even have you killed with impunity for some offenses. And finally, you will see the hypocrisy of a culture which pretends to hold itself to the highest standard of piety and holiness, but in truth hides the worst of its sins away in the dark and tries to convince the rest of the world that they don't exist.<br /><br />Carmen bin Laden is not a great writer, frankly. She tells her story in a fairly straightforward way, with no flourishes and very little stylistic flair. This is not a book to read for style or literary talent -- it is a book to read for substance and for educating oneself. Her lack of artifice in her writing gives the reader a chance to focus more on what she is saying, and this works to the book's benefit.<br /><br />If you're looking to learn something about Osama bin Laden specifically, then this book may be something of a disappointment. He makes appearances here and there and is certainly a major figure in the Bin Laden clan, but he's not a big part of Carmen's story, other than as a prime example of the worst of what Saudi Arabian culture has come to represent. The Osama we see in these pages, in brief glimpses, is a zealot who cares more about his beliefs than he does about the welfare of his own children, and believes firmly in the overall authority of the male over the female in all things. But here's the thing...in this book, you will see that Osama is not unique in this, and in fact that while many Saudi Arabian men are more moderate than Osama in their beliefs, many are not. When Carmen makes the conclusion that \\"The Saudis are the Taliban, in luxury,\\" she is not exaggerating in the least.<br /><br />Saudi Arabian culture is one in which children, when they are schooled at all, spend a great deal of time during the school day learning about religion. They are taught that things like birthday parties and dancing are \\"haram\\" (shameful), and always, that boys have ultimate authority over girls. While reading the book I found myself angry that this culture exists, but more than that, I became angry that my culture, my government supports these injustices. There are those in the United States who make a great deal of political hay out of \\"liberating\\" the women of Afghanistan or Iraq, but when those same people are making deals with and supporting the Saudi Arabian culture the hypocrisy of our own culture also becomes clear. If we are to truly say that we fight injustice, then we must do it everywhere, among our enemies and our allies alike. Our support of Saudi Arabia and its culture of exclusion is shameful in itself.<br /><br />What Carmen bin Ladin did in taking her daughters and herself out of Saudi Arabia was nothing short of courageous. What she has done in writing this book is equally brave. I hope that more people will read it so that the truth is no longer hidden, so that someday, the hypocrisy will end and freedom will become the way of life for all cultures -- not through war, but through understanding. Carmen bin Laden, with this book, contributes to that understanding and contributes to the process of making things better for all./>What Carmen bin Ladin did in taking her daughters and herself out of Saudi Arabia was nothing short of courageous.

US	49094691	R1W6BWR5VU5WXZ	015100692X	990216712	The Crimson Petal and the White	Books	5	7	9	N	N	The Subtle Art of Seduction	Having read Michel Faber's \\"Under the Skin\\" a few years ago, I was looking forward to reading \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" quite a bit.  Even so, I was thoroughly unprepared for just how completely the novel drew me in. In the first few pages of this hefty book (coming in at over 800 pages in hardcover), Faber had me utterly hooked and anxious to learn more about the characters and the story.<br /><br />Faber's technique in getting the reader to read on is simple -- he talks to us directly from the pages. At times he writes as though he is a tour guide, cajoling and nudging the reader to follow this character rather than that one, or even teasing the reader when he makes a slightly bawdy reference to something quite innocent. This idea of addressing the reader directly is most prevalent at the beginning and end of the book, and while it could easily get annoying in short order it's never overdone. I've seen this sort of device attempted before in modern fiction, but rarely has it been this effective. Faber's use of it is nothing short of a seduction of the reader.<br /><br />\\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" traces the stories of several people in Victorian England, from a simple prostitute to intellectual wastrels to captains of industry. Most prevalent in the story is Sugar (just \\"Sugar\\"), who begins the story as a prostitute known for her willingness to do anything for a coin and goes through many changes as the story progresses. Other main characters are William Rackham, a perfume magnate, his wife Agnes, who is ever so  slightly mad, their daughter Sophie, who lives hidden in the shadows of her parents, William's pious elder brother Henry, and his friend Emmeline Fox, whose only wish is to save \\"fallen\\" women through the Rescue Society. Each of these people have a unique perspective to give on their shared story. Some characters rise, some fall, some are changed irrevocably. Most of all, this is a tale of London in the Victorian era, and how these people make their lives in it.<br /><br />As in \\"Under the Skin,\\" Faber's use of language here is remarkable. As one might expect given the characters and the story, this is a book laden with eroticism, and not just in the obviously sexual scenes. Faber has a very sensual way of describing people and places that transcends sex and makes the reader aware of the repressed erotic nature of the Victorian era at nearly every point, especially through the first half of the book. Scents, sights, sounds, and textures are all described with a soft but insistent touch that makes the reader aware of the characters and the surroundings in a surprisingly intimate way. I found myself in the curious position of wanting to read quickly to find out what was going to happen, but wanting to savor it because of the quality of the writing itself.<br /><br />There is never a dull moment in this book, which was a bit surprising to me. Most novels about this era spend so much time on describing events and settings that everything starts to blur together, but that's never a problem here, for several reasons, starting with Faber's clever technique of drawing readers into the book. Once he's drawn you in and established his characters, he works descriptions very naturally into the perceptions of the characters. When you read a description of a place in this book, you don't just get a flat description, you get a feel for how a particular character is seeing something. And as in life, different characters can see the same place or the same event in vastly different ways.<br /><br />And I was delighted to see that, just as he did in \\"Under the Skin,\\" Faber takes what could have been a fairly straightforward story in \\"Crimson Petal\\" and does very surprising things with it. While reading this book, you may find yourself getting infuriated with one character one moment, then suddenly sympathetic for them. You may think you know where the story is going, then see it go in a completely different direction. Nothing in this book happens according to expectation, which is one of the things that makes it so wonderful. It has surprises in store right up to the very end.<br /><br />This is not a book of pat or easy conclusions. Some elements of the story are never fully explained, which will no doubt infuriate some readers. I found it refreshing, and with characters as rich as this and a story as deep as this one, entirely appropraite. We don't get all the answers in life -- we are limited by our perceptions, our fears, and our own self-imposed rules. Why should fiction be any different?<br /><br />I finished \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" with a similar feeling as I had after I read \\"Under the Skin\\" -- a quiet wonder and a deep appreciation for what this writer had done with what, at first, seemed to be a simple story. Faber seduces the reader into his world from the first page, and though the journey is long, he never disappoints. He shows us how our perceptions color everything we see and experience. Though the world the characters of this novel live in is unknown to us, their motivations and their actions become understandable. In coming to know these characters and this story, we come to understand something universal about ourselves.<br /><br />And that, my friends, makes for a great book indeed.rection.

US	49094691	RNYH5OOD2H0M2	0684853507	85988614	Bag of Bones	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Ghosts of the past	Sean Stewart, in his excellent novel \\"Perfect Circle,\\" says that \\"Ghosts don't do things to you. Ghosts make you do unspeakable things to yourself.\\" This is the essence of King's \\"Bag of Bones,\\" one of the finest novels in King's recent career.<br /><br />Right off the bat, King sets the reader up for a rough ride, as Mike Noonan's wife Jo dies in an accident. King writes about Noonan's grief with unparalleled honesty and frankness which touched me throughout, and as the story progresses we learn about their marriage and the secrets which lie behind even the best relationships.<br /><br />The story itself is quite gripping, peopled with King's usually strong characters, and moved along at a consistently brisk pace. Mike Noonan, a relatively popular writer (King does love to write about writers, doesn't he?), begins by struggling with his own grief and a strong case of writers block, but before long he is contending with the pettiness of small-town politics and with a growing sense of a presence, perhaps presences, in his vacation house in Maine. The house, known locally as Sara Laughs, is almost a character in itself, one which reappears later in a different context in King's Dark Tower series. The tale crescendos in a satisfying and chilling conclusion which manages to tie together all of the plot strands King has woven and incorporates all of the complex thematic elements at the same time.<br /><br />King's role as a horror novelist has evolved over the years, and while there are scares a-plenty to be had in \\"Bag of Bones,\\" they are not the sort of scares we found in \\"It\\" or in \\"'Salem's Lot.\\" These are not easy-to-digest monsters or vampires, but subtle fears which get under the skin and stay there to crawl around for a while. These are the shapeless fears that we hear in the dark, the worst conjurations of our imagination. Make no mistake, this is not a happy or comfortable story, but its chilling effects resonate in a way that others stories will not do.<br /><br />\\"Bag of Bones\\" is a story about grief, about loneliness, about secrets, and about the way that tragedy can echo through the years and affect lives far beyond expectations. It is about facing the past, even when the past seems to be beyond suffering. King has truly woven one of his finest and most complex tales here, a story of a haunting past which will not be denied, a ghost story in the best sense of the term. The ghosts which haunt this story are those which knock on the walls of darkened rooms, which move things while we're not looking, which whisper secret words on a breath of air... but more than that, the spirits in this book are those which haunt the very depths of the human heart.<br /> <br />\\"Bag of Bones\\" is a story about grief, about loneliness, about secrets, and about the way that tragedy can echo through the years and affect lives far beyond expectations.

I closed the book after turning the last page, and sat for a time, thinking.<br /><br />How can I possibly sum up what I was feeling at that moment? I've been reading about Roland and his companions for about 16 years -- just over half my life, do ye ken it -- and now it's finally done. King reached the ending to his long tale, and I came along for the ride with him, all the way to the very end. Though some moments were wondrous, some terrifying, and some sad beyond words, I saw it through. Because King saw it through. Because Roland saw it through. I owed them this much, after all they've given me. Having finished, I know I owe them more than that.<br /><br />This final volume, over 800 pages long, did not want me to put it down once I had opened it. Quite simply, it never lets up. Soon after beginning it, I found myself spending every spare moment reading it. Racing through it. Devouring it. I was compelled, by the power of the tale King was spinning and by the palpable presence of the Tower itself to reach the end of this long quest.<br /><br />Is it good? Oh my, Constant Reader... it is much more than that. \\"The Dark Tower\\" is a fitting conclusion to all that came before, and that is saying a great deal. In this book there are wonders to behold and terrors to chill the blood. Surprises abound within these pages, both good and ill. There is little here that is predictable, but there is much to satisfy. This is a book with much meat on its bones, and this reader will likely be digesting the rich banquet of the Gunslinger's tale for quite some time. In this book, Stephen King presents us with the final course in a meal for the imagination, and it is one which I will not forget. This is a tale which will remain with the reader long after the final page is turned. I will not give any of its substance away here, I will leave that for sai King to do in his own way, that the reader may enjoy it all the more.<br /><br />The ending, which I have been anticipating and dreading with equal fervor, comes with a touch of sadness, because as sai King himself has pointed out, endings are heartless. \\"An ending is a closed door no man can open,\\" and having walked through that door, I find it difficult to look back without sadness. King has brought this story and these characters to life for me, and frankly it breaks my heart to have reached this ending. I knew it had to come, and I would be drawn to it as Roland was drawn to the Tower, but having reached it my heart is shrouded.<br /><br />\\"Ending is just another word for goodbye,\\" and now it is time to say goodbye to this story, to these people who give it life. And to give my thanks for their story, which I have treasured unlike any other.<br /><br />Thankee-sai to Oy, of Mid-World.<br /><br />Thankee-sai to Jake, Gunslinger of New York.<br /><br />Thankee-sai to Eddie, Gunslinger of New York.<br /><br />Thankee-sai to Susannah, Gunslinger of New York.<br /><br />Thankee-sai to Roland, Gunslinger of Gilead.<br /><br />And most especially... thankee-sai to Stephen King, Wordslinger of Maine.<br /><br />We were well-met on this path, were we not?

US	49094691	R3LR056QOVSY89	B0002STNQ2	245555180	Prey	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Predictably Crichton -- 'Jurassic Park' Redux	A repeated theme in Michael Crichton's \\"Prey\\" goes something like this: \\"Things never turn out the way you think they will.\\" I find myself wishing that this were true of the novel itself. \\"Prey\\" is a novel that only Michael Crichton could have written, and that comes with both the good and the bad.<br /><br />Crichton's plot, timing, and his ability to keep a story clipping along at a brisk pace are all in evidence here. Michael Crichton books are sometimes better than others, but he rarely fails to entertain or to keep the reader engaged while they are reading. His book are usually fast reads because of this, but they also exhibit that Crichton researches his subjects well, and incorporates that background material into the story without sacrificing the pacing of it. \\"Prey\\" is par for the course by these standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's also par for the course in other ways as well. The characters are thin at best, the themes are ones we've seen before in Crichton's work (most obviously in \\"Jurassic Park\\"), and the ending is weak. The book also suffers from a rather poor development about halfway through -- it's something I shouldn't give away (even though it's telegraphed pretty obviously early on), but suffice it to say that Crichton had the opportunity for a really frightening antagonist in \\"Prey,\\" but sold that potential short in a rather unbelieveable way, and made for a rather bland conflict in the end. Again, all things we've seen before from Michael Crichton.<br /><br />Crichton likes to write about new technology trends, and in \\"Prey\\" he turns his attention to nanotechnology. More specifically, self-evolving artificially-intelligent nanotechnology which (of course) breaks free of its creators and threatens life as we know it. If it sounds familiar, that's because it is -- \\"Prey\\" is basically \\"Jurassic Park\\" warmed over, the same themes in a slightly more modern package. The dangers of science unchecked, the corporate world and the scientific one make poor bedfellows, human ingenuity can often outsmart itself, and so on. Yes, very familiar indeed... which I wouldn't have minded if these themes were expressed in a better book.<br /><br />\\"Prey\\" is a fair book. It's entertaining but light. The pacing is good but the characters are only crudely drawn. Its potential exceeds its execution. If we must compare it to other Crichton books (and in this case, I think such comparisons are inevitable), then \\"Jurassic Park\\" is a better book: more suspenseful and a more honest expression of the same themes.<br /><br />Read \\"Prey\\" for some light brain candy if you wish, but don't expect much more than that.one make poor bedfellows, human ingenuity can often outsmart itself, and so on.

Ghosts make you do unspeakable things to yourself.\\"<br /><br />Here's what Sean Stewart's newest novel is not: it is not predictable, it is not trite, and it is most definitely not boring. It is also, quite frankly, not quite like anything else I have ever read, from Sean Stewart's hand or anyone else's.<br /><br />On the other hand, \\"Perfect Circle\\" is one of the most remarkable and original novels I've read in some time, and of the three Stewart novels I have read, it is easily my favorite (which is saying something -- I enjoyed \\"Galveston\\" and \\"The Night Watch\\" quite a bit as well). \\"Perfect Circle\\" is clever, spooky, funny, sad, sharp, observant, honest, thoroughly modern yet somehow timeless, and very, VERY well-written.<br /><br />In the pages of this short novel, clocking in at fewer than 250 pages in total length, Sean Stewart accomplishes what most writers can't seem to do in a work twice as long. He tells an emotionally honest, unique, and gripping story, featuring characters that are accessible and full-bodied, expressing themes and ideas that resonate long after the reader has turned the last page and closed the book.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Circle\\" is a book about ghosts, about loss, about grief, about responsibility, about family, and about coming to terms with one's lot in life. It is a fantasy novel of sorts, in that it expresses ideas that fall outside the \\"natural\\" laws we accept today, but it is a fantasy novel bearing the dark edge of reality.  This is no escapist fantasy, but rather a strange sort of realist fantasy. It is a combination which Stewart had always danced with in his other work, but never more effectively than in this book.<br /><br />As always, Stewart's prose is a marvel in itself. In his other work I could always see the flair of a poet in his words, and it's here too, but more balanced than before by a succinct, efficient use of words and dialogue. Stewart tells us just enough, never too much, and lets the reader fill in many of the blanks. His use of dialogue is witty and very real, on a par with Quentin Tarantino's handling of dialogue in his films, or Nick Hornby's novels.<br /><br />Comparisons to other authors (Nick Hornby and Stephen King come to mind most readily) are somewhat apt but do not provide a whole picture. What Sean Stewart has really done in \\"Perfect Circle\\" is to establish himself as his own voice, mostly unlike anyone else's. The book could be applied to several genres but not firmly pegged in any of them, and the author is in a class all his own.<br /><br />To put it simply, this is one of the best books I've read in quite a while. Sean Stewart was already an excellent author in my eyes, but with \\"Perfect Circle\\" he has outdone himself. He has written that rarest of things: a truly unique story told in a truly unique way. It is not the story itself which stands out so much as how he tells it, and what it does to the reader. Like a great movie or a really effective piece of music, this little book will echo in your mind and in your heart long after you've put it down, and it will stay with you.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Circle\\" is, in the best sense of the word, haunting.ch, and lets the reader fill in many of the blanks.

You'll likely spend most of \\"Ilium\\" wondering how (or if) the individual stories that comprise it will come together. At least, that describes what happened to me as I was reading it.<br /><br />There are at least three distinct storylines in \\"Ilium\\" as it begins. One takes place on Earth, another on Mars, and still another begins on Jupiter. Each story arc includes some compelling characters, from \\"old-style\\" humans to intelligent robots obsessed with human literature to Ancient Greek heroes and even gods, there's a great deal of different personalities here to work with, and how they come to interact is at least one of the enthralling things about the book as a whole. Simmons spends a long time in establishing the characters and their stories, but it really pays off in the last hundred or so pages, when we see all the story threads start to get tied together into a relatively unified whole.<br /><br />Simmons has always had a talent for story and for character, no matter which genre he's chosing to work in, and it's as evident in \\"Ilium\\" as in any of his other books. The characters are interesting and have some depth to them, and the story hints at a great deal of history behind the story, without spending a lot of time on establishing it. The world Simmons creates for us in this book is alien in ways but has recognizable elements in it, as befits a story which takes places well over a thousand years from our time, but hearkens back to our history (and present) heavily. Along with heavy literary sources, you'll find in these pages oblique references to the tragedy on September 11 and the Holocaust, among many other \\"current\\" events. Simmons' world is one which explores imaginative places and ideas, but it is also one grounded in reality.<br /><br />The literary nods in \\"Ilium\\" are truly clever. In these pages we find not only the obvious source of Homer's \\"Iliad,\\" but also strong references to Shakespeare's sonnets, \\"The Tempest,\\" and some of the works of Marcel Proust. Simmons use of these works in combination flowed well, and I found a lot of enjoyment in how he incorporated some of these seemingly disparate ideas.  Also, more than once, I found myself wanting to go back and read (or, in many cases, re-read) some of the works he makes reference to. It is by no means a requirement to have read the works Simmons gives his nod to, but I believe that it does add to the enjoyment of the book as a whole.<br /><br />Perhaps my only complaint of \\"Ilium\\" is that it takes a while to get going, and Simmons risks losing the audience before really grabbing their attention. However, that is more than made up for as the book races towards its compelling end. I started reading it slowly, but I finished it at a breathless, breakneck pace, and as I turned the final page (with one of the finest cliffhanger hooks ever, to rival the end of King's \\"Waste Lands\\"), I found myself hungry for the second volume in the series, \\"Olympos.\\"<br /><br />Put simply: highly recommended!rcel Proust.

I'm sure that he's very proud.<br /><br />Second, I must point out to Mr. Franken that \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right,\\" is entirely too long of a title. But, Franken fought for the title (though he didn't have to fight very hard, a story he tells in the book), so I guess he earned it. Of course, such a long title must surely denote a serious book, and so \\"Lies\\" is indeed a very serious book.<br /><br />No, actually it isn't. For the most part, it's a very funny book. But  even when Franken is kidding, which is most of the time, he's \\"kidding on the square.\\"<br /><br />This concept, which Franken himself gives its name in the book, is the idea of making a joke about something, but not really joking. Making light of something, but with a serious intent. It's a concept I appreciate, and if I can assist Franken in getting the phrase \\"kidding on the square\\" into the popular lexicon, I will do my small part to give him a hand (hint: you're looking at it!).<br /><br />And that, friends, is exactly what Franken has done here. He moves easily from funny to somewhat serious to downright hilarious, leaving the reader to decide which is which. This is part of the fun of the book. However, a careful reader will note that even when he's making a joke, underneath it all he's serious about his subject matter. The majority of \\"Lies\\" is an exercise in kidding on the square.<br /><br />The book can be seen as a parody, of course, even before one opens it. Franken's chosen title, while a bit unwieldy, lampoons the books of Ann Coulter and the ironic slogan of Fox News in one fell swoop. And this isn't just for show -- Franken skewers Coulter, Fox, and Fox's poster-boy Bill O'Reilly quite thoroughly within these pages.  And the best part is, he often uses their own tactics to do it.<br /><br />\\"Lies\\" is a sharp, witty, observant statement on the complacency of the mainstream media and the opportunism of the right-wing media, and a fine dissection of the things that shape our perceptions today, but it does take a break from making jokes occasionally. The chapter on the death of senator Paul Wellstone is partially touching, when Franken talks about Wellstone's memorial, and also quite angry in places, as Franken pretty much eviscerates the right-wing pundits who spun a memorial service into political weaponry in a matter of days.<br /><br />Franken's conclusion regarding the modern state of the mainstream media is not that they are inherently biased one way or the other, but rather that they are so focused on sensationalist stories that they get lazy when it comes to the honest work of journalism. In the face of the standard \\"You're biased!\\" \\"Nuh-uh, YOU'RE biased!\\" sniping going on today, I find this perspective refreshing, and accurate.<br /><br />Franken's conclusion regarding the right-wing media sources (Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, etc.) is that they deliberately manipulate the facts of the news to affect people's opinions of it. And again, after reading the book and seeing the evidence in front of us, it's hard to argue with this.<br /><br />Franken's conclusions regarding the current leadership in America is that they, too, find ways to misrepresent and mislead in their dealings with the public. This is a conclusion that is hard to ignore, as more evidence for it mounts day after day.<br /><br />And Franken's conclusions about me can be summed up thusly: I'm a virile, handsome man who's a boon to everyone around me. Oh wait, he's never met me. Scratch that last bit. But I am.<br /><br />A final note: Though I typically prefer hardcover books, in this case I find that I'm glad to have read the paperback version of \\"Lies\\" -- not because it's easier to hide quickly (though it is), but because Franken has added some new material to the paperback which wasn't in the hardcover edition. Most of it's just some added tidbits, but the real prize is in the last chapter, entitled \\"I Win,\\" in which Franken details how Bill O'Reilly's and<br /><br />Fox Broadcasting's attempts to sue him and block the book's publication got literally (!) laughed out of court, and helped catapult \\"Lies\\" onto the bestseller lists. This chapter alone is well worth the price of the book, and explains why the paperback edition is dedicated (sort of) to Bill O'Reilly. It was the least Franken could do!<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"Lies\\" more than I expected I would, and got more out of it than I expected as well. I expected something funny, something light -- and those elements were there to be had. What I didn't expect is that the book would make me think as much as it did, and would help me apply a more critical eye to the media sources that surround us increasingly every day. Franken makes a lot of jokes, but he makes it clear that even when he's at his funniest, he's usually kidding on the square.<br /><br />Kind of makes you wonder who else is up to the same thing.dcover edition.

Nevertheless, upon reading the first few chapters of &quot;Carrie&quot; one can see what grabbed her attention. The reader is immediately involved in the story and irresistably drawn all the way to the end.<br />The story of Carrie White is that of someone who is essentially ordinary (almost painfully so), but with an extraordinary ability. How these two elements come together is the substance of the book, and there is a lot of substance here, both in terms of storytelling and thematic material. King's talent for strong character and capturing the feel of everyday life is already obvious in this book, and it is put to good use.<br />&quot;Carrie&quot; remains one of King's most compelling works, even 30 years after it was written. Thank goodness Mrs. King had the wherewithal to get him to finish it!	2004-07-18

Over 25 years after it was published, \\"The Shining\\" remains ones of King's best novels to date. It is not simply the story of a supernatural hotel, but also the all-too-normal corruption and degradation that can exist within the human heart.<br />Jack Torrance is a deeply-flawed man, both as a husband and a father, and when the evil presence in the Overlook Hotel finds him, it exploits his every weakness. \\"The Shining\\" is a gripping book, and it is one of the few books of King's that I would say is truly frightening. King captures his characters here with a sharp eye for detail, and tells a powerful story.<br />This book has suffered not one, but two adaptations to screen (one by King himself), but neither of them really captured what makes The Shining such a standout novel, not just in King's work, but in the field of American letters in general. When King is considered, in years to come, one of the 20th century's great novelists, this will be one of the books studied extensively.	2004-07-18

The trend in modern vampire literature is to make vampires somehow romantic or sexy (thank you Anne Rice), but it should be remembered that vampires did not always have such a refined image. Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" is the story of a sickening monster, and the classic German film \\"Nosferatu\\" certainly does little for the vampiric image.<br />Stephen King's stab at the vampire story hearkens back to these classics. His vampires generate disgust in those who see them; they look ill, and they smell bad. This is definitely not a book for those who think vampires are sexy.<br />That said, \\"'Salem's Lot\\" is a justifiable classic in the field of vampire literature. King is not apologetic or even romantic regarding the vampires, but rather treats them in the classic Stoker tradition, as foul monsters. However it is not his treatment of the vampires themselves that makes this a good book.<br />What makes King's book stand out is his talent for portraying ordinary people in extraordinary situations. The town of Jerusalem's Lot is full of the petty little conflicts and foibles that most small towns have, and King explores tham very well. The vampires find all of these weaknesses and exploit them to tear the town apart. The inevitable conclusion of the book is disturbing, not because of what it says about vampires, but because of what it says about how easily people are corrupted.<br />Also of note: this book marks the original appearance of Father Callahan, who has taken on a prominent role in the recent volumes of King's Dark Tower series.<br />This book has been adapted to the small screen twice (one of them very recently), but both attempts pretty much missed the mark. Though both adaptations have their good points, the book has more depth and more meaning than either TV-movie version managed to capture.<br />This is a great vampire novel (though not for the vampire apologist), and one of King's best books.	2004-07-18

I found myself really getting into Cooper's book as I read it.  He's an easy writer to read.  He keeps things interesting with all sorts of anecdotes and experiences, and he describes them with tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br /><br />That's not to say that he isn't serious about what he has to say... clearly, he is very serious.  In describing the difference between a Designer and a Developer, and even in more detail when contrasting a Visual Designer and an Interaction Designer, he makes clear just how important this subject is, and how the differences he is talking about can determine the process by which a piece of software or application comes together, and the success of the final product.  His obvious frustrations with the roadblocks to effective user-focused design should be understood by anyone involved in the design process.<br /><br />The pinnacle of the book, for me, came in the middle.  At the end of Part 3 (\\"Eating Soup with a Fork\\" -- great title), he discusses the relationship between humans and technology.  He says something so simple that it should have been obvious, but it's really a fairly major shift in perception from what many people think.  He talks about the assumption that technology is dehumanizing here:<br /><br />\\"It doesn't require sophisticated tools to dehumanize your fellow humans -- a glance or a kick does it as well.  It is not technology that is dehumanizing.  It is the technologists, or the processes that technologists use, that create dehumanizing products.\\"<br /><br />This is important to what Cooper is trying to say in \\"Inmates\\" in so many ways.  The theme of the book throughout seemed to be that interaction design is only as friendly, or as UN-friendly, as people make it.  Technology only does what we tell it to, as we design and implement its specific functions.<br /><br />The real revolution that this implies is the possibility that technology can be made to interact successfully with humans, and that it doesn't have to frustrate or debase the people who try to use it.  In fact, as a human creation, technology is as human as we want to make it.  As Cooper said in chapter 6, \\"For users to be happy and effective with software, it must be written in harmony with the demands of human nature.\\"<br /><br />But like anything, to make software effectively intereact with humans (i.e. more helpful, more usable, etc.) takes more work... one of the roadblocks.  Cooper talks, also, about the established culture of programmers.  He defines them as almost a seperate breed of humans, at least as far as their thought process and rationale... \\"Homo Logicus\\" as opposed to \\"Homo Sapiens.\\"  He talks about the rift that often appears between them, largely because of the cultural perception (mostly an obsolete view) that software is a solitary occupation, that programmers work in a vacuum and are the sole authors of their work.<br /><br />The book makes it clear that the software design process can no longer be one which belongs to a solitary person.  The creation of software works better as a collaborative effort than it does as a single-author process.  Product planners, interaction designers, usability experts, testers, and yes, programmers all have their part to play, and when it comes together, it can yield great results.<br /><br />Cooper's conclusion seems to be that the most fundamental changes to the software industry need to be made to the process.  The people who make the software are, by and large, talented at what they do, and willing to change for the better if they can.  It is when they are asked to do more than they should be that problems arise.  A change to the process will ensure that better, more usable products can be made.<br /><br />It seems that most of the people who do the work of making the software in question are willing to change the way they do things, but only need permission to do so.  Cooper's take on it, which I agree with, is that it has become not only advisable to moveon from the obsolete programming culture we have relied on in the past.  If we want to make a change towards more usable products that end-users feel comfortable interacting with, then a change to the process of software creation to a more collaborative effort of interaction design and development becomes an imperative, at the very least.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone involved in the software design process.

A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Excellent Introduction to Web Usability	If there's a book to use when introducing someone to the ideas of usability on the Web, I'd have to say that I think this is it. Not Nielsen, and not Cooper (at least not to start with). Steve Krug's &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; has the most no-nonsense and easy-to-follow approach I think I've ever seen, and best of all, he makes SENSE.<br /><br />First of all, Krug deconstructs some of the sites we all know and use often, and he does so to help us see what we should be doing, as well as what we should not.  I remember being especially impressed with his in-depth analysis of Amazon.com's navigation scheme (Chapter 6 - &quot;Street Signs and Breadcrumbs&quot;), from the use of tabs to the structure of the sub-navigation to color changes, he covers it all with a sense of humor, clear pictorial examples, a sharp eye for detail, and a clear concise explanation of what works and why.  The reader is left with a greater understanding of not only why Amazon has been so successful, but also what choices they made that helped them find this solution.<br /><br />The chapter on usability testing (Chapter 9 - &quot;Usability Testing on 10 cents a day&quot;) was another fine example of clear communication and great ideas.  Krug's breakdown of how the usability process should be conducted, and why it's needed in the first place, is concise and not preachy, as some usability authors are, and it really gives the reader an excellent idea of how they can fit usability into their process.  This is probably the best way to &quot;sell&quot; usability to someone, and he does a great job of it.<br /><br />The whole book is like that, really, but those chapters were highlights in the book for me.  His ideas on simplicity of presentation and home page design were also well-taken, both as a designer and as someone who uses the web.  Perhaps that is what makes his book so excellent, is that really, anyone could get something out of it.  Whether it's the person who surfs the web now and again or the one who designs the pages for it or the one who's paying for the person to design pages for it, anyone could read this book and benefit from it, without having to wade through piles of needless verbage or proselytizing.<br /><br />In the end, &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; seems to be an example of what it advises... it keeps things simple and accessible for a wide variety of people, and thereby makes itself useful as an excellent resource.  The next time someone asks me what Web usability is all about, this is the first book I'll be recommending to them.one who designs the pages for it or the one who's paying for the person to design pages for it, anyone could read this book and benefit from it, without having to wade through piles of needless verbage or proselytizing.<BR> <BR>In the end, &quot;Don't Make Me Think&quot; seems to be an example of what it advises... it keeps things simple and accessible for a wide variety of people, and thereby makes itself useful as an excellent resource.

At least, it was definitely an inspiration for me.<br /><br />I didn't expect to get much out of it when I started it, frankly.  Part of that feeling is attributable to the fact that I didn't know Rand's work as well as I should.  I had heard the name, but did not know what he had done.  As the book began, and I figured out that he is, in a large way, responsible for the corporate identity of some pretty big names (IBM, Westinghouse, and UPS among them), and is capable of working in multiple media, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional, I found myself respecting him.  As it continued and he showed himself to be not only a very creative designer, but also a thoughtful analyst and an excellent communicator, I found myself agreeing with most of what he had to say.  As the book concluded, I found myself inspired in my own work by what he pointed out.<br /><br />&quot;A Designer's Art&quot; is everything its title implies... it is about good design and it is about compelling art. The two, while not necessarily the same, are definitely fused together in many ways.  Artistic disciplines and methods and trends affect design work to a large extent, while principles of good design can also be applied to the basic creative process one goes through when making a more purely artistic endeavour.<br /><br />Particularly compelling in this regard was the chapter near the end of the book, about the benefits of the &quot;play instinct&quot; and how it applies to design.  By discussing several games and ways of playing with visual relationships, such as tangrams, tatami (the arranging of floor mats), Le Corbusier's &quot;Modulor,&quot; and the creation of Chinese characters, Rand discusses several games and how they can be used in the design process, either in the solution for a specific problem, or as tasks in and of themselves.  These &quot;games&quot; help to teach the designer to look at visual presentations in a different way, to see tired concepts in a new light, and to use originality to think their way around a problem.  Like directed play does for children, visual games help to discipline the mind to see through what is presented and into an original way of looking at the same thing. &quot;The student learns to conceptualize, to associate, to make analogies,&quot; he says. &quot;To see a sphere, for example, transformed into an orange, or a button into a letter, or a group of letters into a broad picture.&quot;<br /><br />Also very interesting was his discussion of the color black, reclaiming it for new audiences and new purposes, and his thoughts on including a sense of humor or wit in your designs.  His conclusion is where I really came to admire this book, though, as he relies on the words of one of his employers: &quot;Good design at heart is simply honesty. It is an ingredient of character. Good design helps to form in any one part of the business an influence that affects all part of the business. It sustains character and honesty in every part of the business. Good design, therefore, is very good business indeed.&quot;  It's a good thought to take away from this book, that a skilled designer's work is valued by those he or she works for, and a reminder of the burden that designers bear in their work.<br /><br />Reading Rand's &quot;A Designer's Art&quot; was something like the experience I had when reading Stephen King's &quot;On Writing.&quot;  Both men are (or were, in Rand's case) masters of their respective craft, and both have had their effect on our culture and our way of life, each in their own unique way.  More importantly, though, just as I was inspired to write as I was reading &quot;On Writing,&quot; so too was I inspired to make something new and original as I put down &quot;A Designer's Art.&quot;  Both books inspired me to create.  I can't think of any better motivation for reading them than that.n for reading them than that.	2004-06-23

At some point around the 11th Stanza (&quot;The Writer&quot;), &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; is, like the song says, guaranteed to blow your mind.<br />Picking up right where &quot;Wolves of the Calla&quot; left off, our heroes Roland, Eddie, Jake, and the relative newcomer Father Callahan prepare for yet another sojourn out of Roland's world and into ours. Right off the bat, though, things do not go quite as planned. A Beamquake shakes the foundations of all the worlds, and we learn that the Tower is in much greater jeopardy than we may have previously suspected. And as always, wherever Roland goes, gunplay is sure to follow, but this time, it's waiting for him...<br />King's further explorations into the rich world of the Dark Tower are as rewarding as they ever were. The characters, by now, have become as comfortable as old friends. Still, there are new facets to be seen yet, and we get a closer look at each of them as the story goes on.<br />It's very difficult to write about this latest installment without giving what makes it so different away completely. The events and revelations found in &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; are so central to the themes of the overall story, and yet revealing them here would entirely ruin the fun of discovering them as King has presented it. Some readers will doubtless dislike the road King has begun to travel as the story approaches its conclusion, but I am convinced that many more will absolutely love it. It is a credit to King's growth as a writer that he can even attempt this ambitious sort of storytelling, and more, that he can do it successfully... at least, so far.<br />One thing is certain: love it or hate it, &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; is King's riskiest and most surprising work yet. One the one hand, he is taking one of the most overused plot elements in fiction -- the baby of uncertain parentage -- and making something original and interesting out of it. On the other, he is attempting something seen in modern fiction only rarely... a self-relexive work that engages the reader on multiple levels.  By the end of &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; you may find yourself thinking about the realities that fiction creates, and the fictions that &quot;real&quot; life presents us with every day. And if you do, I believe that is entirely the point. King seems to be angling not only toward a conclusion to Roland's quest, but also toward a deeply personal statement about what it is to be a writer. It is an ambitious road to travel, but so far, King has not let us down. In fact, what he has begun with this book has the potential to exceed all the expectations I had for it.<br />'Ware, Constant Reader: &quot;Song of Susannah,&quot; like &quot;The Waste Lands,&quot; ends with a cliffhanger. In fact, there is not only one cliffhanger here, but two. The last pages of &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; should leave many readers, as it left me, powerfully hungry for the final book in the series. What lies in wait on the final page is, to say the least, quite a shock. It leaves the fate of Roland and his companions, as well as that of the Tower itself, enshrouded in doubt.<br />&quot;One more turn of the path, and then we reach the clearing.&quot;<br />I, for one, can't wait to get there.ng something original and interesting out of it.

In fact, there is not only one cliffhanger here, but two. The last pages of &quot;Song of Susannah&quot; should leave many readers, as it left me, powerfully hungry for the final book in the series. What lies in wait on the final page is, to say the least, quite a shock. It leaves the fate of Roland and his companions, as well as that of the Tower itself, enshrouded in doubt.<br />&quot;One more turn of the path, and then we reach the clearing.&quot;<br />I, for one, can't wait to get there.	2004-06-15
US	49094691	R2X32NSZV34CVN	0151327653	276635923	Foucault's Pendulum	Books	5	19	20	N	Y	Interpreting the language of connections	\\"...if there had to be a cosmic plot, we could invent the most cosmic of all.\\"<br />\\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" is a book rich in history and deep in mystery. Even when you reach the end, you may not be entirely sure what just happened. And of course, considering the subject matter, that is entirely the point.<br />The story centers around one Casaubon, a student writing a paper about the Knights Templar. By chance, he meets Jacopo Belbo, a book editor working for a small publisher in Milan. They strike up a fast friendship, and Casaubon shortly begins working for the same publisher, helping them to gather facts and imagery for a new series of books they are publishing.<br />Casaubon, Belbo, and another editor named Diotallevi take a morbid interest in the subject matter of the many books that are brought to them. The prospective authors, who they call \\"the Diabolicals,\\" present them with far-fetched ideas about global historical conspiracies and a centuries-old plot to somehow rule the world from the shadows. While each story is different, the three men can see common threads running through all of them, and on their own time they explore the idea further themselves, just for the fun of it.<br />Using an early model of a word processor (celverly named Abulafia, after the Hebrew Kabbalah scholar), they begin borrowing random concepts from the work of the Diabolicals and stringing them together. They include other sources as well, just to mix it up a bit. What they discover is what they call the Plan, and it could be the most important conspiracy theory in the history of the modern world, involving the Rosicrucians, the Jewish Kabbalah, Masonic rituals, Napoleon, the Nazis, and of course at the center of it all, the Knights Templar, spanning over 600 years of European history... or, it could just be a huge coincidence.<br />What makes \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" such a great novel is not just how it strings the different pieces of the puzzle together (which it does masterfully), nor simply how it makes it whole idea so compelling (which it also does well), but how, simulataneously, it makes you question everything you're reading. Right up until the end (and even beyond), Eco keeps you guessing as to what is \\"real\\" and what is not. Where other authors, covering similar subjects, make the conclusions predictable or melodramatic, Eco manages to find a place where the reader is never really sure if what they're reading about is fact, fiction, or something in between. The conclusion is subtle, and leaves nagging doubts in the reader's mind.<br />The history presented in the book is top-notch, and it's never presented in a way that is insulting or \\"dumbed down\\" for the reader. Many books like this tend to include long, painfully obvious passages of exposition, but with Eco one never feels like the information is being presented by sacrificing the story. He manages exposition quite well, and everything that is presented matches the needed context of story and the characters.<br />The characters themselves have depth, and their dialogue never fails to make them real for the reader. I particularly enjoyed one part, early on, when the three new friends discuss a School of Comparative Irrelevance, a course of studies for useless or impossible subjects, such as \\"Urban Planning for Gypsies,\\" \\"Morse Syntax,\\" and \\"The Phonetics of the Silent Film.\\" This passage served many purposes. On the surface level, it was extremely amusing. It also told the reader a great deal about each of the main characters in an efficient, transparent way. Finally, it serves as foreshadowing of the far broader and deeper invention these characters would soon be embarking upon. To accomplish so much in just a few pages of (primarily) dialogue is the mark of a gifted author.<br />Through the course of the book Casaubon has many different experiences, both mystical and mundane. Abulafia becomes more than a simple word processor, it becomes a source of truth and another veil of mystery to be pulled aside. Belbo tries to reconcile his sardonic nature with the mystery they seem to be uncovering, trying to maintain a scholarly distance while becoming more and more entranced with the story beneath the stories they hear. And Diotallevi ties everything they learn in with his own beliefs, and what truth means to him.<br />In the end, \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" is a story about faith, and both the wonderful and terrible things a powerful belief can accomplish. It is also about how different people can take the same facts and each will interpret them in their own way, often wildly different from one another. Eco conveys his ideas via a compelling, original story, and in so doing makes we, the readers, think about what he has to say. It is not the facts themselves that are important, but only the connections we make between them. Perhaps, in the end, it is the interpretations, not the facts themselves, which shape beliefs... and therefore shape the events of history.<br />\\"But I have come to believe that the whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth.\\"tery to be pulled aside.

After reading it I can say that, for me at least, it is both.<br />Anne's story has so many elements. It is largely the story of herself, a developing, maturing teenager, and the people she interacts with on a daily basis. But as the Nazis take over and she is forced to go into hiding with her family, there is a sharp feeling of change. It is still her story, a very personal story. And yet, permeating her story at every point is this sense of something very dangerous all around, constantly threatening to encroach. We already know most or all of what the Nazis did as they occupied much of Europe, but Anne's diary is a historical document in the sense that it provides a unique, deeply personal perspective on how that time effected a very few people. Some people wil say that history is mainly told in the big events, but I disagree. History means little if we can't see how it effects even the most unlikely, otherwise unknown people. In reading Anne's diary, I could see history's effect on the individual more clearly than ever before.<br />And yet her writing itself is quite good as well. It's fairly good when the diary begins, with her at age 13. It is even better when it ends, shortly after she turns 15. She had a talent for description and an eye for detail that is rare in any writer, and she was very honest in her feelings, opinions, and experiences. We get her impressions of the Germans and the occupation, of course, but we also get the stories of her squabbles with her family and with the other members of the \\"Secret Annex.\\" We get the stories of arrests and raids, but also the story of Anne's impending menstruation and developing sense of sexuality. We hear about food shortages, but also about what she learned during her stay in the Annex, academically and otherwise.<br />In the end, reading Anne's diary feels wrong in a way, because it is the very personal thoughts of a young girl who is struggling to express herself, and confiding in a receiver who was never meant to be a real person. And yet, now millions have read her thoughts. It is -- I can't stress this enough -- a story of a maturing teenager. In a sense, it could be the story of my babysitter, or even eventually of my own daughters a few years down the road. However, it is also a story told under circumstances that would make most teenagers (and adults) cower in fear. The fact that Anne had the presence of mind and the strength and the courage to write down this document makes this one of the most important diaries ever written.<br />I won't soon forget it.learned during her stay in the Annex, academically and otherwise.<br />In the end, reading Anne's diary feels wrong in a way, because it is the very personal thoughts of a young girl who is struggling to express herself, and confiding in a receiver who was never meant to be a real person.

Let's face it, your average science fiction/fantasy/horror/thriller novel may be entertaining, even meaningful, but rarely stands out as a craft of language and structure.<br />In &quot;The Night Watch&quot; I was pleased to find both a good story and an excellent example of literary craft. Some passages of the novel read like poetry, with a cadence and a cunning use of language that somehow moves the story along at the same time as it makes the reader pause and admire.<br />Chapter 12 was one part in particular, in which the bodyguard Jen is practicing his martial arts moves to distract himself and trying not to attract the attention of a local demon, and as he goes through his moves he remembers his past. The end of this chapter is both beautiful and deeply disturbing. This chapter by itself makes the book worth reading, to me. It is one of the best examples of Stewart's excellent use of language, but there are many others throughout the book.<br />I loved seeing how magic and technology were incorporated in the book, and how they sort of became one and the same in some instances. It reminded me of Tim Hunter's experience in the far future of Neil Gaiman's original &quot;Books of Magic&quot; miniseries, in which magic and technology have become so intertwined as to become indistinguishable. I remember something along the lines of &quot;computers made up of a net of spells.&quot; Think also of Arthur C. Clarke's line: &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; Sean's idea of combining the two may not be completely new, but he carries it off very well. Better than most, I would say.<br />For its craft and its excellent story, &quot;The Night Watch&quot; is well worth finding and reading, and Sean Stewart is certainly a writer to be watched.	2004-03-19

While there are clearly elements of science fiction (that's what the book is marketed as), there's also a strong sense of a good old-fashioned murder mystery within these pages. And the conclusion depends upon the successful fusion of both types of writing... the solution to the &quot;whodunit&quot; is something nobody but a hardcore sci-fi audience would get.<br />In Brin's story, humanity has made contact with other races throughout the Universe, and found that they are a rare breed: a race which seemed to have developed on its own. Most of the other races they have met can credit their evolution to another race helping them along, a process known as Uplift. Humanity, however, is something of an oddity: an &quot;orphaned&quot; race whose origins are unknown. That doesn't stop them from taking part in Uplift, however.  As we learn early on, the human race has undertaken the charge of Uplifting two other Earth races: dolphins and chimpanzees. In the course of the novel, the reader meets examples of both races which have been helped along by humans.<br />The story centers around a ship called &quot;Sundiver.&quot; As its name suggests, the ship's main purpose is to explore the sun. Early on we learn that it has discovered a form of life living within Sol's chromosphere, something which also seems to be previously undocumented elsewhere in the Universe. The question of humanity's Patrons is raised, and many anicent alien races seem at least a little chagrined that this upstart race is discovering more than their collected knowledge can reveal.<br />When a crew member of Sundiver is killed, however, the story picks up on a different angle, and it becomes critical to not only find out who killed him, but why. The fate of humanity's status among the stars is at risk, and the twists and turns of the story from that point are dramatic, to say the least.<br />I enjoyed Brin's imaginative story and what he did with it. By framing the mystery aspect of the story in a classic Agatha Christie format of a closed group of possible suspects (including several aliens), he opened up the possibilities of the science-fiction aspect of the story. The question of &quot;who?&quot; could only be answered by first answering the question of &quot;how?&quot; The path that leads to the final answer is long and winding, but in the end it is worth the journey. The final revelation is not shocking in a &quot;Usual Suspects&quot; sense, but it definitely makes the reader re-think some of the conclusions they mave have drawn early on about the characters and their motivations. As in any good murder mystery, all is not as it first appears.<br />The passages in &quot;Sundiver&quot; which describe the exploration of the Sun itself are worth mentioning as well. They are detailed but not overdone, expressive of majesty but not exaggerated. In short, I really got a sense for what it might be like to travel into that forbidden inferno, what it might look like and how it would feel. That in itself was an impressive acheivement.<br />&quot;Sundiver&quot; dragged briefly in a few places, but overall it was an entertaining book, and a pretty clever one to boot. A compelling beginning to an idea that has a lot of potential. It makes me curious to read the other books of the Uplift series.say the least.<br />I enjoyed Brin's imaginative story and what he did with it.

Is anything so pure? Or is love, by its nature, a reciprocity, like oceans and clouds, an evaporating of seawater and a replenishing by rain?&quot; - from &quot;Reunion,&quot; by Alan Lightman<br />Every few years, I get a little gift: a new novel from Alan Lightman. He doesn't publish fiction often, but when he does it is invariably worth reading. Best of all, each book is different from the others, while all are good.<br />Lightman's style is one of elegant language and a unique perspective. In each of his books, I find enjoyment simply in the words he uses, and how they flow together to form his narrative. In this, &quot;Reunion&quot; is no different -- Lightman's use of language is beautiful in and of itself.<br />In terms of the story itself, &quot;Reunion&quot; is about a man in his fifties who attends his 30th college graduation class reunion. In his own words, he lives a &quot;comfortable&quot; life -- he's divorced, with one child, and basically unremarkable, but &quot;comfortable&quot; nonetheless.  At his reunion, he sees some people he remembers from college and meets a few new people. However, the real &quot;reunion&quot; of the story is when the main character (Charles) confronts his memories of the intense love affair he shared with a ballet dancer in his last year of school.<br />To be honest, this is a story that most of us have read before. It is Lightman's perspective on the story, and his keen sense of observation, which elevate &quot;Reunion&quot; above the trite and pithy messages of other, similar, stories. Lightman offers ideas and viewpoints which are rare in modern fiction -- perhaps even unique to this novel. As such, &quot;Reunion&quot; is a rare and valuable book.<br />Particularly memorable about &quot;Reunion&quot; is the way Lightman conveys Charles experiencing his memories. In several instances, he sees and hears what happened in different ways -- the idealized version that is what he thought would happen at the time, and the more human version which is probably closer to what really happened. The reader is left to question whether either &quot;version&quot; of Charles' memories is what really happened, or if true events were some unknown mixture of both versions. The subjectivity of memory is one of the major topics of the novel.<br />&quot;Reunion&quot; is a story about love, to be sure... and a touchingly bittersweet one at that. However, it is also about the changes and compromises that come with age, about the natural fallacy that personal perspective brings to events, and about the fragility of our memories. While it may not be my favorite of Lightman's books (that label still belongs to &quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot;), it is ceratinly an example of why I always look forward to a new Alan Lightman novel.sion that is what he thought would happen at the time, and the more human version which is probably closer to what really happened.

The concept of the Well World, for example, is fairly original and has a lot of potential for easily delving into many different cultures and alien races. Unfortunately, the idea is not explored nearly as well as it could be, and is really only a superficial device to serve the plot... such as it is. The different alien cultures and races of the Well World are only explored thinly, with no sense of richness or history in it. The different races seem to be created for their wierdness factor than any actual examination of different cultures.<br />What's worse is the story itself isn't all that great. Remove the concept of the Well World, and you have a fairly standard quest framework. The main character has a \\"mysterious\\" (but rather predictable) origin, but his personality is still a carbon-copy hero from any swashbuckling space opera. Think Han Solo and you've pretty much nailed him. The other characters only seem to act as foils for how his story is told. Throw in some alien sex here and there, a standard \\"universal translator\\" device to get over the problem of different languages, and end with a very predictable conclusion, and what the story amounts to is... not much.<br />Without the concept behind the story, it's really pretty bland. The plot moves along sluggishly, with several blatantly obvious passages of exposition masked as character dialogue. I found a scene near the end, in which the characters are travelling down an extremely long moving walkway to their destination, especially annoying in this regard.  There was no good reason for the walkway to be there, and it had already established that such clunky transportation was unnecessary on the Well World. The only reason for it to be there was so the main characters (and the reader) could be told what was going on up to that point. This passage was perhaps the worst example of several similar parts of the novel, in which story exposition is dealt with in an exceptionally clumsy way.<br />Chalker's writing style leaves much to be desired as well. His use of language is minimal and not suggestive at all of the weight he attempted to give the subject matter. Dialogue was essentially the same from one character to another, with none of the usual language markers to differentiate different people or different groups (this goes to the lack of cultural depth in the book discussed earlier). The characters lacked any feeling of honest emotion, such that I didn't connect with any of them at all.<br />For an idea with so much potential, this book was really lacking in so many ways. It was vaguely entertaining in some parts, but overall felt poorly-written and trite. Chalker's treatment of a good idea ended up very broad but also very superficial, only scratching the surface of the story's potential. I would love to see an idea like the Well World given a proper treatment by a better writer, one with a talent for how to craft alien worlds and different cultures with some sense of validity and history. Without that, a book like this just falls flat.<br />I won't be keeping this one, and I do not recommend it, unless you're into shallow, poorly-written science fiction.ed that such clunky transportation was unnecessary on the Well World.

In &quot;Endless Nights,&quot; he provides yet more evidence as to why these comparisons are justified.<br />Like the rest of Gaiman's &quot;Sandman&quot; series, &quot;Endless Nights&quot; tells stories about beings of great power, which represent universal themes and truths. In addition to the Endless, the seven great beings embodying essential aspects of all living things (Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Despair, Delirium, and Desire), in &quot;Endless Nights&quot; we also find references to cosmic topics like the origins and personalities of the stars and planets, powerful stories in the tradition of the best folktales, and intensely personal stories of modern people.<br />The illustrations of this book are top-notch, truly some fantasy-pairings of visual stylists with Gaiman's unique style. Each story has a different illustrator, and while all are good, a few stand out. Milo Manara's vision of Desire is surely the best I have ever seen, Barron Storey's &quot;15 Portraits of Despair&quot; demands that each page be examined closely, Bill Sienkiewicz's take on Delirium is so perfect that one wonders why it wasn't done before, and Frank Quitely's short tale of Destiny is the perfect end to the book.<br />The only thing going against the book, I would say, is that it's billed as a &quot;Sandman&quot; graphic novel, but it really is not one. Its stories, while intriguing, do not fit in effectively with the rest of the Sandman stories. Rather, they are stand-alone stories about the Endless, which means that they're good stories, but they're not an integral part of the larger work of the &quot;Sandman&quot; series.  It has been almost ten years since the end of the original &quot;Sandman&quot; series, and it shows. The only other time since then that Gaiman has revisited these characters was in the excellent &quot;The Dream Hunters,&quot; which was more of an integral part of the &quot;Sandman&quot; story than &quot;Endless Nights&quot; is.<br />Still, other than the minor disappointment of not being a better fit for the &quot;Sandman&quot; story arc in general, &quot;Endless Nights&quot; is a fine piece of work in itself, and can be enjoyed many times. The art is beautiful, the stories rich and full of meaning and cultural reference. I would recommend it to just about anyone, but especially fans of Neil Gaiman's other work, fans of the Endless, and avid readers of fairytales and mythology.the &quot;Sandman&quot; story than &quot;Endless Nights&quot; is.<br />Still, other than the minor disappointment of not being a better fit for the &quot;Sandman&quot; story arc in general, &quot;Endless Nights&quot; is a fine piece of work in itself, and can be enjoyed many times.

Farther along the path of the Beam is a smallish town called Calla Bryn Sturgis. It hovers at the edge of Mid-World, the final step along the road to End-World, and so to the Dark Tower. It is a farming community, the people grow rice and corn there.<br />And once every generation, the Wolves come to steal their children.<br />It is to this place that Roland and his band of gunslingers have come. To some, they are a welcome salvation... to others, a dangerous change from the way things are.  In Calla Bryn Sturgis they meet many memorable new characters, and at least one that we may recognize from an even older story. As the story progresses, Roland will dance, Jake will make a new friend, a new life grows within Susannah, and the bond of ka-tet is threatened even as it gains a new member.<br />\\"Wolves of the Calla\\" continues King's tale of Roland's quest for the Dark Tower by strengthening the bonds between characters and offering up tantalizing new hints to what is to come. King's gift for portraying ordinary people in extraordinary situations is as strong as it ever was in this book, but what sets the \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" apart from King's other recent work is the power and breadth of his vision. King is telling an ambitious tale here, and this part of it is full of nobility, courage, and above all, simple human frailty.<br />The Dark Tower series is shaping up to be Stephen King's broadest tale in scope. The last 20 pages of \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" yield at least a couple serious shocks that may leave the reader wondering about what they've just read, and anxious to read it over again to pick up details they might have missed. But of course, like any skilled writer, King also leaves the reader wanting more. In a good way. In the best way.<br />If I'm right about where King is going with this long tale, the ending should be absolutely astounding. Even if I'm wrong, however, the rest of the story should be interesting, at the very least.	2003-11-22

Far from it; &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; quickly captures the reader with a unique and compelling voice. The difficulty is that the first part of the book is tragic beyond words... and yet Frank McCourt has found words which capture the tragedy of his early years with ruthless honesty.<br />In bone-clean prose, McCourt details the events of his early childhood, first in America and then in Ireland. His story is an interesting one, to be sure, but the most notable thing about it is the way he tells it. McCourt's straightforward style perfectly portrays how a child sees the world and his family. Especially early on, there is no moralizing or judgment; events simply happen, often for no discernible reason (although reasons are clear to the reader). As McCourt grows, so the prose becomes more complex, and his understanding of what is happening to his family crystallizes.<br />McCourt also does a great job capturing the rhythm and cadence of dialogue and regional accents, especially the Irish way of speaking English. While reading the book's dialogue sequences, a reader can hear the people speaking in their inner ear, can hear the thick Irish accents of some, the clear English of others. Simply put, Frank McCourt has one of the finest ears for dialogue of any writer I've ever read.<br />The imagery of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is simple but vibrant, the story moving and very, very real. It is, in many ways, a difficult book to read, but that is simply because it is so well-written, and portrays a difficult subject with honesty and clarity. One finishes the book wishing that more writers could write this clearly, but even more important, the reader understands what Frank McCourt went through as he grew to a young man. If that reader is anything like me, it will make them very thankful for what they have.	2003-11-10
US	49094691	R2HA5N8K9OITNE	0670030643	89209679	The Eyre Affair	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	A fun story, but tries a bit too hard to be clever	Imagine, if you will, a world in which literature receives the attention and following that spectator sports receives in our world today. Basically, the &quot;pop culture&quot; of our world is focused on classic literature in Fforde's world. Baconians and Marlovians get into fights about who actually wrote Shakespeare's plays, and vast numbers of John Milton imitators hold conventions. Intellectual property is taken so seriously that a division of the Special Operatives (SpecOps) is set aside just to sort out issues of whether or not original manuscripts are the real thing. These are the Literary Detectives, or the LiteraTecs, and the main character of the book is one of them.<br />&quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; is told from the perspective of Thursday Next, agent of SpecOps-27, working in London as the book begins. Thursday is a veteran of the Crimean War (which has gone on for over 100 years in this world, and continues still), and her father is an agent of the ChronoGuard.  He tries to maintain consistency in the time-stream, and is usually successful.<br />Early on in &quot;The Eyre Affair,&quot; the original manuscript of Dickens' &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; is stolen, and we discover that a device has been invented which allows a person to actually enter the world of a book and experience it directly. These two plot points, at first unrelated, we soon come to learn have everything to do with one another.<br />The villain of the book, a memorable character named Acheron Hades, has stolen the Chuzzlewit manuscript in order to wreak havoc on the story by altering it.  Hades is perfectly evil, almost indestructible, and one of the most fun villains I've read in some time. He's perfectly happy to make mischief just for its own sake.<br />The story works well overall, but what really made me want to read it were the details Fforde added to this word he created. Public Will-Speak kiosks which will perform quotes from Shakespeare when you put a coin in. A riot caused by Surrealists. And perhaps my favorite part of the whole book, a performance of &quot;Richard III&quot; performed by members of the audience, with full participation (and heckling) akin to what one finds with &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; in our world. This scene alone made the whole book worth reading for me. Literary references abound in &quot;The Eyre Affair,&quot; pretty much ensuring it as a fun read for any well-read individual.<br />Unfortunately, in parts Fforde tries a little too hard to be clever. For example, the naming of his characters got a bit annoying after a while, as it seemed that every character had to have a clever-sounding name. The main characters, Thursday Next and Acheron Hades, are prime examples, but far from the only ones. Secondary and tertiary characters with names like Braxton Hicks, Victor Analogy, and a vampire hunter named (you guessed it) Spike are only a few more. After a while, the &quot;clever&quot; character names became a bit much. Also, Fforde was more than willing to sacrifice a consistent story for his clever literary plays, as things which couldn't happen in a previous chapter suddenly did later, just to make some other clever jab at Dickens or Shakespeare. It was fun, but it didn't always make sense, even within the &quot;rules&quot; of its own world.<br />There was an almost self-reflexive quality to &quot;The Eyre Affair,&quot; as the book got near the end, as the reality of the story exists on several levels.  At one point, there is a character trapped inside a Wordsworth poem, the manuscript of which is inside the world of &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; which is inside the story of &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; itself. It almost makes the reader step back out of the novel for a moment and consider what they are reading and how they are interacting with it. Somoza's novel &quot;The Athenian Murders&quot; is the only book I've read to successfully pull off this sort of reader involvement, but &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; does come close to it at a couple points in the story.<br />I actually enjoyed &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; quite a bit, despite its minor annoyances. In taking us into the world of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; near the ending, it made me want to re-read the Bronte novel as we experienced characters in the context of their own world. Fforde's novel is clever and imaginative, even if it doesn't always make perfect sense. It's a book written with an old book-geek like me in mind.t; does come close to it at a couple points in the story.<br />I actually enjoyed &quot;The Eyre Affair&quot; quite a bit, despite its minor annoyances.

US	49094691	R3CBA1HLAZBKKL	0151002517	787923440	Blindness	Books	5	4	5	N	N	There is much to see in "Blindness"	\\"Blindness was spreading, not like a sudden tide flooding everything and carrying all before it, but like an insidious infiltration of a thousand and one turbulent rivulets which, having slowly drenched the earth, suddenly submerge it completely.\\" - from \\"Blindness\\" by Jos&eacute; Saramago<br />Look around you for a moment, take in your surroundings. Now imagine that you cannot see these words you're reading, or the page in front of you, or the people near you. Imagine, instead, that your vision has been blasted away by a field of white, as if your eyes had been immersed in a milky sea. Imagine further that the people around you, everyone else, is experiencing the same thing; their sight stripped away and replaced with only white. What would you do? How would your perceptions change? What would happen to the world around you if this came to pass?<br />This is the world of \\"Blindness,\\" Jos&eacute; Saramago's Nobel Prize-winning novel. It begins with one man, sitting in his car, stopped at a stoplight, waiting for the light to change. Suddenly, inexplicably, he goes blind. One moment he can see, the next, he sees only white. Over the course of the next day, everyone he comes in contact with -- his wife, his eye doctor, the other patients in the waiting room, the man who helped him home (and later stole his car) -- all go blind. Then the people they contact go blind, and so it spreads, and spreads, and spreads. Despite attempts by the government to contain the blind, the blindness spreads like wildfire throughout the nameless country.<br />In some ways, \\"Blindness\\" reminded me of the first part of Stephen King's \\"The Stand.\\"  In King's book, it is a deadly 'superflu' which spreads rapidly across the world, and we see some of the same traits in King's characters that we do in \\"Blindness,\\" the same base pettiness in some and the same selflessness in others. However, where King chose to tell a grand tale of Armageddon and good versus evil, Saramago took a very different route, telling a very personal, intimate story of only a few of those afflicted with the \\"white blindness.\\" And of course there is a dramatic difference in writing style between King and Saramago. Suffice it to say that the similarity of situation is where the similarities between \\"Blindness\\" and \\"The Stand\\" pretty much end... but it is worth noting that people who liked \\"The Stand\\" for its premise may well enjoy \\"Blindness.\\"<br />Pretty much anything by Jos&eacute; Saramago is a challenging read, and \\"Blindness\\" is no exception. His writing style is distinctive for its long, meandering sentences and its eschewing of standard grammatical conventions for dialogue and paragraph divisions. As in the other two Saramago books I have read, page-long passages of dialogue appear without line breaks or quotation marks. In any other writer's hands, it would quickly become a muddle, but Saramago makes it work for him, and for the story. In fact, the writing is of such overall quality that it really heightens the enjoyment of the book, rather than detracting from it. Saramago creates passages of incomparable beauty and clever wit and inexpressable degradation in \\"Blindness,\\" such that merit repeated readings, not because they aren't understood the first time, but just to fully appreciate them for what they are.<br />The characters in \\"Blindness\\" are unique and unforgettable. They, like the country and city they live in, go through the entire book without proper names. They are \\"the girl with dark glasses\\" and \\"the doctor\\" and \\"the woman on the first floor\\" and \\"the first blind man\\" (meaning the first man to go blind, at the beginning of the book). Somehow, the characters not having names brings them that much closer. We cannot separate then from us, because we don't have names to do it with. \\"Blindness\\" is a very personal portrait of these characters, dealing with every aspect of their lives and how they adapt to being stricken with the white blindness. From getting food to recognizing a loved one to their sex lives to what they now have to do in the bathroom, we come to know these people very well by the time \\"Blindness\\" is over. In a perfectly-maintained circle, we come to understand the larger story only through the perceptions of these few characters, and we come to understand the people in how they react to the events of the story. The events are extraordinary, but the characters experiencing them are very, very real.<br />When I finished \\"Blindness,\\" I closed the book, put it down slowly, looked up at what was around me at that moment. It was a beautiful day. Everything looked new and perfect, like it had been there since the beginning of time and would be there until the end. The book reminded me of just how much we all come to rely on the frail apparatus by which we experience the world, these senses we have, especially sight and how important it is -- not just so we can see where we're going but so we can see the people around us, see our lover's face when we wake up and when we go to sleep, see our childrens' eyes looking at us, see a beautiful blue sky arching over clear sparkling waters. \\"Blindness\\" reminds us to look, and more than that, to see clearly all those things around us that we hold dear.

The only thing that can stop it is a riddle... a riddle Blaine cannot solve.<br />There are many suspenseful and exciting moments in the fourth book of King's Dark Tower series, and the beginning is certainly one of them. However, the story we know of Roland so far really began somewhere in the middle. Much of the story in &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; is actually a story within a story, as Roland tells his companions the story of what happened to him in Mejis, one of the Outer Baronies of Mid-World, when he was fourteen. In this story we meet Cuthbert and Alain, two of Roland's dearest friends, and Susan, who he meets in Mejis and who will become the love of his life. We also hear a bit more about the rebel John Farson, and some of the events leading up to the downfall of Gilead and all Roland once held dear. At least two elements of the story presented before, in the first three volumes of the story, are resolved in this one, but new questions are raised, many strands remain, and many things remain to be resolved.<br />The main theme of this fourth book is the concept of fate, or destiny, or &quot;ka,&quot; as it is called in Roland's world. Through this story, we begin to see how Roland's ka intertwines with that of everyone around him, and how it has pushed him steadily and inexorably towards the Dark Tower, whether he likes it or not. Accepting his fate is a part of Roland's nature by now, but what we see in this story is that the choice has never really been his. Whatever his fate will be, he has little choice in the matter. Whether he chooses to accept it or not, his fate is what it is. Ka sweeps all before it, like a hurricane wind blowing through the lives of all. The role of ka in the lives of all of these people becomes more clear in &quot;Wizard and Glass,&quot; not as a vague concept but as a hard reality.<br />Something else that comes into play in &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; is something that King has observed himself: the world he has created for the Gunslinger really encompasses all the worlds he has created before. In this story, and in the Dark Tower stories to come, we can see obvious elements from a great deal of King's other work, such as &quot;The Stand,&quot; &quot;Eyes of the Dragon,&quot; &quot;The Talisman,&quot; and others. Even some of the fantasy worlds created by others are here, overlapping Roland's world. The hints we have received so far are intriguing clues to what is to come, and will likely send many readers (like me) back to other King books get more of the story.<br />This fourth volume of the Dark Tower is not my favorite part of the story (that would have to be the second part, &quot;Drawing of the Three&quot;), but it is a powerful continuation of the story so far, adding important elements and further filling out the characters. This series in general is some of the best writing King's ever done, and this book is consistently good.<br />A final note in particular about the illustrations... the illustrations for the Dark Tower series have been generally excellent, but Dave McKean's work for &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; seems particularly well-suited to the subject matter. Combining surreal elements with a unique style of presentation, McKean captures much of the depth and darkness of the story. In the pictures that accompany this part of the story, the reader can find the hard edges and strangeness that is needed to express Roland's world, but was missing from some of the previous books' illustrations. McKean's work here is illustrative in more than one sense of the word.<br />One thing is clear by the end of &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot;: whatever Roland's fate -- his ka -- is to be, he and his companions will meet it standing up. We don't know what that fate is going to be, but whatever it is they will stand, and they will be true.'t know what that fate is going to be, but whatever it is they will stand, and they will be true.	2003-09-16

The main conflict facing the small group in the beginning of this part of the story is twofold.  They are looking for clues as to how to best begin the next leg of their quest towards the Dark Tower, of course. More importantly, they are also forced to deal with how best to deal with the growing rift in Roland's mind, a doubling of memory caused by his travels in our world in the second book. In one track of time, the boy Jake was killed in New York and somehow brought into Roland's world. In the other track, Jake never died at all, thanks to Roland's actions in our world. Roland is aware of both timelines as real, and this conflict becomes the heart of the first act of the book.<br />Jake himself is also aware of the split.  Still alive in New York, he nevertheless remembers his death under the wheels of a Cadillac, and his subsequent time with the gunslinger in the Great Western Desert, as a parallel track of memories to his memories of spending the same time, after not being hit by a car in New York.  And just like Roland, the rift in his memory is driving Jake insane.<br />Resolving this disparity of time and memory causes great difficulty for Roland and Jake, of course, but also requires much of Eddie and Susannah, the two companions Roland drew from our world into his in &quot;The Drawing of the Three.&quot; Before facing this, however, the new companions must deal with Mir, the great bear, a relic of the world that has moved on. Mir is one of the Guardians of the Beam, and the Beam will eventually lead them to the Tower.<br />The second act of the book details Roland and his companions passing through Lud, a ruined city which has been further torn apart by the generations-long war of its inhabitants, the Grays and the Pubes. Run by ancient machinery, the city presents its own unique challenges for our heroes, and also provides them with the next step in their journey: Blaine the Mono. Blaine is a monorail train which runs along the path of the Beam, deep into Mid-World. Riding Blaine comes with its own price, though -- &quot;Blaine is a pain, and that is the truth.&quot;<br />&quot;The Waste Lands&quot; lives up to the quality King has established so far for the Dark Tower series. The story moves along at a brisk pace, making you want to keep reading to find out what happens next. &quot;The Drawing of the Three&quot; was a slightly better book, in my opinion, but only by a little. The characters which were built so well in the first two books are developed further here, and the new characters that are introduced (some only to tantalize for future developments, it seems) are equally well realized. All in all, this third book is a fitting continuation of an excellent series.  It answers a few questions for the reader, and poses many intriguing new ones.<br />A word of advice for the Constant Reader.

Even by King's own admission, however, the series doesn't start to really pick up steam until this book, &quot;The Drawing of the Three.&quot;<br />Without giving much away, I can say that the second book picks up very shortly after the first one left off, and right off the bat the reader gets a few surprises. Without sacrificing the essential nature of Roland as we have come to know him, King quickly begins to introduce elements of vulnerability and danger that were somewhat missing from the first installment. The gunslinger is just as powerful and skilled as ever, but we begin to get the sense now of the larger world around him, and the incalculable odds he faces in his quest.<br />Roland's task in this book is represented by three doors. They are doors standing on a beach of the Western Sea, seeming at first to open on nothing, but they actually open on a different world -- our world. From each of these doors, Roland must draw someone or something. As he progresses, he is fighting for his own life even as he fights to continue in the path his search has laid for him.<br />Most striking in this book is the theme that runs throughout of addiction. Each character in the book has their own addiction, something that gives them strength but also makes them weak, something they depend on perhaps a bit too much. The people he meets behind each of the three doors give us (and him, I suspect) further insight into the gunslinger's own addiction, his need to find the Tower, a need he will sacrifice anything to fulfill.  It is a compelling thread in every part of the story, and there is a strong suggestion that for every addiction, there is someone there willing to feed that addiction for the person suffering it. For every addict, there is a pusher. The question remains, who is feeding Roland's addiction for the Tower?  Is he feeding it to himself, or is it some other -- perhaps the Ageless Stranger mentioned in the first book? This remains unanswered as yet, though there are clues later in the series.<br />The character development in this book is much stronger than in the first. There, King laid the foundation for his characters, rough but strong. Here, in this book, is where he begins to truly build upon it, giving his characters shape and texture and color. Roland comes into much sharper focus in this book, and the new characters he introduces are classic King; everyday people plucked out of their everyday lives and thrust into extraordinary circumstances. How they rise to the new challenges they are presented are just as telling as how Roland rises to his own new challenges.<br />The end of this book is a solid conclusion to the story, but makes the reader hunger for the next chapter all the same. &quot;We are going to fight,&quot; Roland tells his new companions. &quot;We are going to be hurt. And in the end we will stand.&quot;<br />This is an impressive chapter in the ongoing story of the Dark Tower, and serves as proof positive to me that the series is destined to become a classic dark fantasy epic.eone there willing to feed that addiction for the person suffering it.

Now, in this new revised edition of the book, King has done the same thing once again. He has added tantalizing new hints of foreshadowing to the Dark Tower story, and has really brought the first book of the series more in line with the rest of the volumes, sharpening up the language and providing more insights into the world (worlds?) Roland is travelling.<br />In the new edition of &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; there are subtle twists in the story from the first page on. Readers already familiar with the world of the Dark Tower will find plenty of fresh meat to chew on here until the new books in the series are published. I believe that readers who are new to the series will begin with an even stronger sense of immersion into this story, as the expansions of plot King made will serve as a stronger bridge leading into the rest of the story.<br />It is a deceptively simple story: Roland, the last hero of a dead way of life, pursues a mysterious Man in Black across a great desert. Along the way, we learn about some of the hardships he has faced along the way, even as the story continues with new adventures. Through this simple device, King begins the arduous, painstaking work of building the most complex world he has ever developed, and populating it with many interesting characters.<br />Perhaps the most intriguing part of the revised edition is a new mystery which King presents us, in the form of the number 19. The number becomes a minor plot point in this revised edition, with strong hints that it will have significance later in the series. Apart from the mystery of 19, we have new insights into Roland's past, further explanation of who the Man in Black is and why Roland is pursuing him so resolutely, and more hints as to what lies ahead.<br />King's Dark Tower series is a fantasy epic on the same scale as Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and it is every bit as compelling. &quot;The Gunslinger,&quot; as the Man in Black reminds us in the final chapter of the book, is not really the beginning of the story.  It is, rather, the end of the beginning.

Susan Minot proves that it can be done in \\"Rapture.\\"<br />Let's be clear here: \\"Rapture\\" is not a book about sex.  At least, it's not only about sex, which seems to disappoint some readers, given the premise. It's also a book about relationships between men and women, about misunderstandings that can occur between them, about love and intimacy, about distance and disappointment. It's essentially about the things that can go right and wrong in a relationship, and about how very different one person's perspective can be from another's.<br />As \\"Rapture\\" opens, the reader observes a rendezvous between two former lovers, now together again unexpectedly, just beginning a sexual interlude. As it progresses, we are given insights into their past from the perspective of both the man and the woman, and we can see how each interprets the same events. Sometimes their take on their shared past is similar, but other times (more often), they see it in widely disparate ways.<br />As the act progresses towards its inevitable conclusion, the story takes surprising turns. While at least one aspect of the ending is somewhat predictable (how could it not be?), the tone and mood established by Minot's tale at that point give even that a new angle. What would likely be a trite and pithy conclusion in most authors' hands becomes refreshingly new again in Minot's treatment of it.<br />When all is said and done, \\"Rapture\\" is an insightful look at relationships and modern attitudes about love and intimacy, and at how sex can color one's view of these things in surprising ways. It is not intended to titillate its readers, but rather, to communicate to them. It's not a particularly happy book, nor is it sad. It is, however, a compelling story, elegantly told, and unremorsefully observant. Minot proves her skills here, both as a storyteller and as a canny observer of human nature.nny observer of human nature.	2003-07-31
US	49094691	R2CKINK9KNV6AK	0451176464	591143364	Gerald's Game (Signet)	Books	4	70	71	N	N	A Surprising Game	It was an old criticism of King's work, before \\"Gerald's Game\\" and \\"Dolores Claiborne\\" were published, that he couldn't write a convincing female character between the ages of 17 and 70. Given his penchant for writing about either young girls (Carrie White, for example, or the little girl Charlie from \\"Firestarter\\") or old women, it seemed to be a valid point for a long time.<br />This book, which is an excellent one for many reasons, seemed to be King's first direct response to that criticism.  In it, he proves once and for all that he can write a female lead character as compelling and believeable as any of his other characters, and can tell a fine yarn at the same time.<br />The book starts out in surprising territory for King: a sexual game being played by Gerald Burlingame, who has just handcuffed his wife Jessie to the bed. This is not the first time this game has been played -- it's an old routine at this point, one which Jessie never particularly liked and has now grown quite bored with, to the point of frustration. She tells her husband that she doesn't want to do it this time, but he presses on. In the ensuing struggle, he has a heart attack and dies, leaving her handcuffed to the bed, in the middle of nowhere.<br />That's when the story really starts. King's real strength in this story is not just in telling what happens to Jessie in her predicament, but King uses this device to tell the story of how she got there in the first place. What sort of woman is Jessie?  What events led her to this place, this man, this scenario? In the course of the story, as Jessie struggles to free herself from her bonds, we also find out why she is there.<br />Contrary to what some other reviewers have said, I found this book to be a page-turner. It kept me up very late finishing it, and once I was finished, I quite literally did not want to turn out the light. This does not happen to me often; in fact, this is the only King book that has had this effect on me. The effect is largely due to a very effective description, about halfway through the book, of something Jessie sees, or thinks she sees, in the corner of the darkened room in which she is trapped. The scene was so powerfully described that it bothered me for the next week, and inspired me to make a drawing called \\"Made of Moonlight,\\" which was an attempt to exorcise the scene from my imagination. Even re-reading it now, I find that part absolutely chilling. It's one of the high points in the book, and one of King's most frightening moments in any of his work.<br />Bear in mind, this is not a supernatural horror novel. Its only supernatural element is a slight tie-in with events in his other \\"eclipse\\" novel, \\"Dolores Claiborne.\\" \\"Gerald's Game\\" is mainly a character study, with elements of horror interspersed to keep the reader engaged. The fear, however, comes from a place that is all too real and believeable, and it comes because King has crafted such a powerful story, and such a sympathetic lead character in Jessie Burlingame.<br />In the end, \\"Gerald's Game\\" is not one of King's easier stories to read. It deals with some real issues, and its terrors are only too plausible. Unlike \\"The Shining\\" or \\"Cujo,\\" it's difficult to put this book down at the end and convince oneself that the same thing couldn't happen to you. It's not a book about the scary monster that comes from under the bed. No, in the final analysis \\"Gerald's Game\\" is about the monsters who sleep in the bed with you, cleverly disguised, and about those monsters who were there to shape your past.largely due to a very effective description, about halfway through the book, of something Jessie sees, or thinks she sees, in the corner of the darkened room in which she is trapped.

US	49094691	R2KMPLQ1K4INMP	0380977788	425362981	Coraline	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Gaiman's best book to date	\\"Coraline\\" is one of those rare young adult novels which works well for both children and adults. I read it first to myself and then to my kids, and I was surprised to find that they were as delighted by it as I was, even though they were not as disturbed by some of the imagery of the book that got to me. The Dave McKean illustrations throughout the book serve to enhance the story rather than distracting from it, and as with most Gaiman/McKean collaborations, the pictures are almost ideally suited to the printed words, and vice versa.<br />The story is simple, and at its basic level, it's one we've heard before. A young girl, bored and trapped inside on a rainy day, explores her house and finds a hidden passage into an alternate version of her house, in which things seem... different. Wrong, somehow. Though at first the differences are vague, they become more and more clear as the story progresses. When the inhabitants of the alternate house, specifically the twisted other-mother, somehow trap Coraline's parents, she finds that she must face the potential danger to get them back. Her companion for much of the resulting adventure is a cat, which can talk when it's of a mind to do so.<br />Lewis Carroll would be proud... \\"Coraline\\" is a book easily in the tradition of his Alice books, with all of the wonder and magic that he somehow captured, coupled with Gaiman's canny observations, witty dialogue, sprinklings of literary reference, and all-around good writing. There's plenty of story here to keep kids enchanted with the story, and plenty of meat for adults to chew on as well. \\"Coraline\\" is truly a book for children of all ages.<br />Perhaps it is only the perspective of an adult which makes some of \\"Coraline\\" so disturbing. Specific images from the book (long fingernails clicking against black-button eyes, for example) have stuck with me as both especially memorable and intensely chilling. Gaiman has a talent for such things, and I've come to admire him for it.<br />It is also Gaiman's best book to date, and this is coming from an avowed fan of Neil Gaiman. I enjoyed \\"Neverwhere\\" and adored \\"American Gods,\\" but \\"Coraline\\" is a novel of another caliber entirely. In it, Gaiman walks the fine line between children's fantasy and adult terror, and what emerges is a story which is capable of addressing both, while not diluting the wonder or the horror.<br />Truly, a great book to be treasured for everyone in the family.>It is also Gaiman's best book to date, and this is coming from an avowed fan of Neil Gaiman.

US	49094691	R1EO9IGI38HY15	0140861580	40528119	Rose Madder	Books	5	8	9	N	N	A Great Reading of a Great Book!	This was one of my favorite King books when I first read it the 'old-fashioned way,' page by page. It's a great story about a woman's newfound independence, and what she has to go through to acheive it. The story itself is worth the price.<br />When I listening to it as an audiobook, one finds that the reading can make or break the presentation. Fortunately, King teams up with Blair Brown, with Ms. Brown reading all of the parts told from Rose's perspective, and King reading the parts told from Rose's violent husband Norman's point of view.<br />Blair Brown is a wonderful reader for any book. I've gotten to the point where I'll listen to an audiobook just because she reads it, whether I'm really into the book or not. She brings an individual subtlety and life to each character, without making it corny or overdone. The fact that Rose, the main character, takes a job as a reader of audiobooks about midway in the novel makes it all the more fitting.<br />King has always read his own work well, and this is no exception. His parts, because they are the parts of the 'villain' are not always easy to listen to, but they are always well-performed. His reading style, surprisingly, works well with Brown's.<br />This is not an easy book. The subject matter is difficult, ranging from miscarriage to spousal abuse of the worst kind. The calculated nature of Norman's character makes it all the more disturbing. The plot has twists and turns like any of King's best novels, and despite a slight misstep at the end, still leaves the reader (or listener) pretty well-satisfied. The reading is as close to perfect as one could hope.<br />This is one of my favorite audiobooks, and a prize of my personal collection.	2003-07-21
US	49094691	R2CE4ADR56WLT9	006103018X	552239081	Coldheart Canyon	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not Barker at his best, but worth reading.	I wish I could say that I liked &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot; more than I actually did. Clive Barker is one of my favorite writers (and artists), and his more recent book &quot;Abarat&quot; really restored his status for me. However, &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot; is not a terrible book, it just isn't the top-quality work I often expect from Barker's pen.<br />The interesting thing about &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot; is that I could see in it his perspectives on Hollywood and California in general. I get the distinct feeling that much of what we see in the characters and the story of the book are sort of &quot;in-jokes,&quot; little jabs at people he's known or met since he's been in the United States. There are parodies of Hollywood producers and actors, as well as what seemed to be a somewhat self-conscious look at people who've moved to California from other places.<br />The story centers around a young man and his gradual seduction by a spirit in a haunted house. As the story progresses, we get more and more hints that the spirit in the house (the ghost of a classic Hollywood actress) led a much more scandalous life than anyone really knew about... or at least more than they talked about. Our hero experiences spiritual orgies and debaucheries, all done with Barker's usual flair for the graphic.<br />The feeling I get from &quot;Coldheart Canyon&quot; in the end is that it was trying to be something like a parody of the standard Hollywood expose. The problem with it is that it's taken to such extremes that the funny or wry elements get overshadowed by the more glamorous, dramatic, graphic parts. The ending, also, is somewhat unsatisfying.<br />Barker has definitely written better books than this, but for some hint of what he thinks of Hollywood and his fellow Californians, it still makes for an interesting read.	2003-06-07
US	49094691	R1M0LDDIBDSTDW	0671695185	318179539	Blue World	Books	5	36	36	N	N	One of McCammon's Best	Robert McCammon has (for the most part) stopped publishing his work. With the notable exception of the excellent &quot;Speaks the Nightbird,&quot; he hasn't published new work in 10 years. I can only say that this is a pity. Re-reading &quot;Blue World&quot; recently, I was reminded of why.<br />&quot;Blue World&quot; is a collection of 12 short stories spanning McCammon's career, and one novella. The stories are all worth reading, offering up a good variety of material, from the frightening (&quot;Yellowjacket Summer&quot;) to the disturbing (&quot;Pin&quot;) to the sublime (the novella, &quot;Blue World&quot;).<br />What this collection brings to mind most, however, is McCammon's skill at setting a mood. He tells a great story, but very few writers can set the stage better than McCammon. While reading &quot;Yellowjacket Summer&quot; the reader can't help but feel the oppressive heat prevalent throughout the story, and how the characters must have felt experiencing that same heat. In &quot;Blue World,&quot; he captures equally well the quiet of that soft twilight, just before full dark. In &quot;Night Calls the Green Falcon&quot; one can really feel and understand the frustration and the impotence of a young man's ambition trapped in an old man's body.<br />By so skillfully establishing the mood in each and every one of the stories in &quot;Blue World,&quot; McCammon makes the reader experience them as if they were there, inside the story itself. This is the magic of what great writing can do, bring the story home to the reader, and make it an experience.<br />Like my other McCammon favorites, &quot;Boy's Life&quot; and &quot;Speaks the Nightbird,&quot; &quot;Blue World&quot; is one of the books that I treasure, from an author who now writes far too infrequently.	2003-06-07

I can include it here, and even say that it is critical to understanding the nature of the idea behind this book, without giving anything specific about the book away. All of the things that it describes specifically happen in the first chapter or two. The book's themes, present troughout the story, are summed up elegantly above.<br /><br />\\"The Stone Raft\\" is an impressive novel, in many ways. It is the second of Saramago's books that I have read, \\"All the Names\\" being the first. While I found \\"All the Names\\" to be well-written, clever, and imaginative, \\"The Stone Raft\\" surpasses it easily. It tackles a difficult concept within the first few chapters, an event which changes the world dramatically. I've found that most writers, when beginning with such a concept, either pull their punches and fail to take their story as far as it could go, or they quickly devolve into trite reiterations of common morality and sentimentality. Saramago does neither. His story is one of fantasy, in many ways, but it is a fantasy based in the real world, and Saramago proves himself to be a remarkably gifted fantasist as he carries his story all the way to the end without faltering.<br />The premise of \\"The Stone Raft\\" lies in a seemingly cataclysmic event: the breaking away of the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain) from the rest of Continental Europe. The peninsula (now an island of sorts) simply fractures off and floats away across the ocean. While the larger story of this and its effect on the rest of the world is told as well, the majority of the book focuses on five people who live on the Peninsula, each of whom feel that they are somehow connected to the breakaway. The story follows their journey as they come together, and then of the relationships that develop between them. Through it all, Saramago remains constant to his purpose; whether telling the story of the floating island or detailing the lives of these five individuals on it, his themes and style are maintained.<br />Mind you, Saramago is not an easy author to read. His themes are challenging, to be sure, but his prose itself is equally so. He writes in long, meandering sentences, embedding key points of story in what might seem at first like a tangent. He eschews the standard grammatical use of quotes and paragraph divisions in his dialogue, so that conversations between characters are read as single paragraphs, with no quotes to tell you when one character stops talking and another starts. These are the ways that polite authors make it easy for their readers to understand their work, and I suppose that means that Saramago is not as polite as many writers. Said simply, \\"The Stone Raft\\" (and Saramago's work in general) is not for the light reader, looking for a bit of evening entertainment before they drift off. I'm risking sounding a bit elitist here, but to be perfectly honest, this is deeply challenging reading, and is probably not for just the casual reader. In defying many standard conventions of modern letters, Saramago is placing part of the burden on his readers to adjust to his style of writing.<br />What's amazing to me is that, despite these difficulties, which would probably be barriers for most writers, Saramago makes it work for him beautifully. He spends time actually establishing his characters, and so even though the standard puncuation of dialogue is absent, conversations can still be understood if read carefully. His sentences, seemingly endless at times, are constructed carefully. Like the partial sentence quoted above, they each hide buried treasure, small gems that collectively add to the value of the story as a whole. In these constructions, he often touches on philosophy, political commentary, history, whimsical humor, all while carrying the story forward. If you just graze over the prose, you'll most likely miss many of the bits of wisdom he plants here and there. \\"There are endless answers just waiting for questions,\\" is a sentence representative of the need to read this book carefully. Complexity does not necessarily mean skill, but in Saramago's case his complex prose leads to a work of rare beauty. It may well represent a challenge to many readers, but it is a book undeniably worth the effort. The more a reader puts into reading it, the more they are likely to get out of it.<br />This is not a book to be devoured quickly overnight. Time should be taken to read and re-read some of the passages in \\"The Stone Raft.\\" The spread of the phrase \\"We are Iberians too,\\" around Europe, in all its different languages; the elegant device of a blue thread, linking two characters perfectly; from the opening paragraphs to the final pages the book deserves a careful, studious reading. Some books seem to be written out of sheer love of crafting language, while others seem to exist simply to tell a story. \\"The Stone Raft\\" is that rare novel which accomplishes both goals admirably.<br />A line traced on the ground. A dog who does not bark. A flock of starlings. A man who can feel the earth trembling. A stone thrown into the sea. A peninsula that suddenly and inexplicably becomes an island. A blue woolen sock. How are these things connected? \\"The Stone Raft\\" does not answer these questions for you, but gives you enough that you might be able to find the answers for yourself. In its pages, while telling a story of an event that literally changes the world, Jos&eacute; Saramago explores the mysteries that we all are confronted with every day, and he does so with consummate skill.<br />\\"For even if my life's journey should lead me to a star, that has not excused me from travelling the roads of this earth.\\"less at times, are constructed carefully.

Here, Simmons gives us what we so rarely see in horror fiction - the psychological and emotional aftermath of a horrific experience.<br />Simmons also takes the standard genre elements and turns them on their collective head, all the while telling a good story that keeps you reading. \\"A Winter Haunting\\" is an admirable novel, and I can't imagine a more fitting continuation of its predecessor, \\"Summer of Night.\\"<br /><br />I re-read \\"Summer of Night\\" just prior to this book, to have the story fresh in my head. I don't think that it's strictly necessary to read the older book to appreciate \\"A Winter Haunting,\\" but I would have to say that knowing what happens in \\"Summer of Night\\" definitely adds several important perspectives to the events of the later book.<br />Dan Simmons has made a career out of writing excellent novels in multiple genres, and \\"Summer of Night\\" was no exception; one of the great modern horror novels. As in most such books, the story ends when the evil is defeated. \\"A Winter Haunting\\" reminds us that, in real life, the story never really ends there. Those who endure after suffering loss and trauma have to live with what has happened, have to deal with it as best they can.<br />Dale Stewart, in \\"A Winter Haunting,\\" has dealt with the horrific events of his childhood by not dealing with them - by shutting them out, by refusing to even remember them. A writer now, as well as a college professor, Dale is also the survivor of a failed marriage and a failed affair with one of his students. The books he has written thus far are formulaic adventure stories. He is visiting the town where he grew up, living in the house of his friend who died in the summer of 1960, in order to try and gain something intangible that he feels he has lost, and to write a new sort of story about that long-lost summer that he cannot remember.<br />In returning to Elm Haven, the town where he grew up, Dale confronts a few of his old childhood fears as well as many of his new, \\"adult,\\" ones. What is really interesting about this is that we come to see that many of the troubles he has suffered as an adult are at least partially a result of that terrible summer in 1960, which he has never faced and dealt with directly. In \\"A Winter Haunting\\" we get to see what most horror novels never show us: we see what happens to someone who confronts evil and lives to tell the tale. There are no pat conclusions or pithy observations in \\"A Winter Haunting\\" - just an implied truth that sometimes memories are too terrible to be relived, and that some stories take a long time to tell.<br />Though \\"A Winter Haunting\\" is a sequel to \\"Summer of Night,\\" as I read it I got more of a feeling of remembrance from the book. It builds upon the events of the earlier story, but it also deviates from them quite dramatically in tone and theme. It's not a nostalgic novel at all. In fact, it's almost anti-nostalgia. As Dale tries desperately hard to create memories of a summer he can't remember, even as he confronts new terrors both real and spiritual, we are led to the conclusion that some things simply cannot - or should not - be recalled with fondness.<br />In \\"A Winter Haunting\\" we are reminded that horrible events have consequences beyond the events themselves. They can exact a psychological toll that can take a lifetime or more to overcome. Once again Simmons has given me a pleasant surprise; not because he has written yet another fine novel (that's an expectation by now), but because he has explored original territory in the horror genre. And he has staked his claim well.e a new sort of story about that long-lost summer that he cannot remember.<br />In returning to Elm Haven, the town where he grew up, Dale confronts a few of his old childhood fears as well as many of his new, \\"adult,\\" ones.

There's very little that's predictable about &quot;Under the Skin.&quot; This is perhaps one of the strangest books I've read all year. Trying to pigeonhole this book in a genre is impossible, as it mixes thriller elements with horror, science fiction with a highly literary sensibility.<br />First and foremost, Faber's writing is wonderful. He tempers his language like a swordsmith, starting from raw story elements and gradually refining them, working in key concepts patiently, until the full shape of the story becomes clear. He doesn't rush, and he seems to love the act of wordsmithing itself. The book is a joy to read, even just from the standpoint of beautiful words.<br />In contrast to this is the story itself. It's a challenging story, one which is both disturbing and enlightening. The main character, Isserley, at first seems somewhat strange, but it's only as the tale progresses that you learn just how very strange she is, and how her circumstances are perhaps even stranger.  And yet, by the end, she becomes very real. This personality, who at the beginning seemed so distant, and then so impossibly different, becomes someone I can understand easily. Her motivations, her feelings, her pain... it all comes into clear focus.<br />The themes of the book challenge the meaning of what it is to be human. Is &quot;human being&quot; just a phrase, or does it mean something? Does it mean different things to different people? From an outside perspective, what are we, really? Which are all important questions... and perhaps what I liked best about the book is that these questions were implicit. They were never stated outright in the book, but were asked subtly, through the telling of a compelling story.<br />More than anything, the book reveals out own assumptions and prejudices by taking them and flipping them on their head. &quot;Under the Skin&quot; is not about what you think it might be about. By the simple persuasion of its elegant language, it made me question a great deal of what I believed to be real and reliable.<br />A highly recommended book, especially for people who like surprises.eat deal of what I believed to be real and reliable.<br />A highly recommended book, especially for people who like surprises.	2003-01-22

I suppose comparisons to &quot;Christine&quot; are inevitable. But really, is it so inconceivable that an author can write two book centering around cars and they be two completely different books?<br />&quot;From a Buick 8&quot; proves the point, for me. As far as I'm concerned, it couldn't be more different from &quot;Christine,&quot; despite the spooky car angle they both share. &quot;Christine&quot; isn't one of my favorite King books, really, though it's not one of his worst either. It's a pretty straight horror story, well-told but fairly typical of early King and the genre in general. Nigh-invulnerable killer car goes after a bunch of kids... Friday the 13th for the automotive set, gotcha.<br />&quot;From a Buick 8&quot; has very little in common with &quot;Christine,&quot; though, other than an old car with supernatural overtones. &quot;Buick 8&quot; is so much more about buildup and characterization. It's a story about people, and as a story which is told from the perspective of 5 or 6 different narrators (very convincingly, I might add), it's also a story about storytelling.<br />It's a story in which very little actually happens. There are very few cataclysmic events or shocking revelations. The spooky car in &quot;Buick 8&quot; never goes on a rampage or kills a bunch of people in increasingly nasty ways (at least, you're never sure that it does). It spends 95% of the story in a shed behind a rural police station, throwing off the occasional light show and spitting out the occasional oddity.. and at least one monster (and even that is left to interpretation). But the car itself does very little.<br />&quot;Buick 8&quot; is a mystery, but not in the Agatha Christie sense of the word, because it's not all wrapped up in a neat little bow at the end. It's a book that observes that there are very few concrete answers in life, especially for the &quot;big stuff.&quot; It's a story about how even the strangest events get incorporated into our everyday lives. We deal with them, we do what we have to, and we move on. It's not always the most dramatic or the most satisfying, but it's the way things are.<br />The message of the book seemed (to me) to be encapsulated near the end, when Sandy observes this: &quot;The world rarely finishes its conversations.&quot; It's a truth that King himself seemed to understand when writing the book, something absent from much of his earlier work.<br />&quot;From a Buick 8&quot; is worlds different from &quot;Christine,&quot; literally and figuratively. It's a far much more mature book, and it shows King's growth as a writer more clearly than anything other the the &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series. It deserves to be noticed as the work of a mature writer, independent of his previous work.the strangest events get incorporated into our everyday lives.

US	49094691	R10AP8FF6UVAUY	0374106770	252394770	The Athenian Murders	Books	5	5	7	N	N	A novel that simply defies description.	It's a story within a story, within another story. It's an eidetic novel. It's a philosophical progression. It's a self-reflexive text. It's a quest for truth. It's a mystery, in many senses of the word. It's &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but rendered in prose and about a thousand times better. It's pure poetry in parts. It's a novel about ideas and words, and whether one can exist without the other.<br />It's one of the best books I've read in years.<br />It's difficult to say anything specific about &quot;The Athenian Murders&quot; without spoiling the wonder of it completely, but I can safely give it my highest recommendation. About halfway in, I gave up trying to figure out how it would end and just let myself enjoy its twists and turns. I've rarely been more richly awarded by trying out a new novel.	2002-09-10
