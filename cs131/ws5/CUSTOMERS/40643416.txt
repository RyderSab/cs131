Candide is a naive young man who lives in paradise worshiping his one true love, a princess at the castle in which he resides.  The cruel world comes in and sends him on a trip of horrors that would make what Job went through seem like a blister. Fast moving, exciting and funny as a great novel can be.<br /><br />This book can be read as a fun tale of misfortune and woe, or it can be read as a deep philosophical tale.  Which is why the book is brilliant, it works on many different levels.  Actually, it works on every level, which is why I recommend it to everyone who claims that they love to read.  The humor is biting and hilarious, which is why it is the greatest satire ever written, even if the object of the satire has long since died.<br /><br />I do want to point out one thing, and it won't ruin the ending, because the ending isn't as important as the journey.  Many people see this novel as an unabashed, full on assault on optimism.  It isn't.  Read the ending again.  In the end things work out for the main characters, just not in the way they could have ever imagined in the beginning.  I think that this novel deals with the unreal expectations of youth and innocence than it does optimism.  READ FOR YOURSELF AND DECIDE!!	2004-10-02
US	40643416	R25VFAB6BUSHMJ	0805210407	377046405	The Trial	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Virtually Perfectly Written Novel	I do not as a rule review the plot of books because I don't want to give too much away and many other people do that in their reviews.  I will say what most people know, that a man is charged and later executed for a \\"crime\\" despite his innocence.  To add insult to fatal injury he is never told what his crime is, and is subjected to the twisted inner workings of a secret \\"justice\\" system.<br /><br />I want to give my personal thoughts on this excellent novel.  It is a shame that Kafka wrote this at one of his most self-critical stages.  He never fully completed the novel and that is most disappointing, but what he did leave behind is just remarkable.  It is a brilliant book that is chilling and some would say prophetic.  What I would like to point out, which hasn't been written in the reviews I have seen, is the brilliant and extremely subtle dark comedy.  It isn't throught the whole book and on every page, but it is there and when I read it the second and the third time you can see it very clearly. It is Kafka's exceptional mind at the height of creativity.  It is sprinkled through the book at the best moments and the perfect time. Often refreshing and disarming.  Wonderful!<br /><br />Read this book. You will not regret the time you spend, and like me you might find yourself reading it repeatedly.	2004-10-02

This book is an excellent and vert comprehensive overview of Pragmatism.  This is only one thing that needs to be pointed out that wasn't directly stated in the other reviews.  You have to be extremely interested in the subject matter and have a background in philosophy to firmly grasp the complex issues.  Some chapters are more accessible to the layman than others, while the slight majority of them are difficult reads for anyone.  I enjoyed the book and I absolutely loved some of the writings, especially William James's works, but it was not an easy read.<br /><br />Lastly, the book was a little too dry.  I have read other pragmatist works that were humorous and insightful while also being easily accessible to virtually all readers.  This volume had none of these and that is a shame.  Other than that the book was excellent and highly informative.	2004-10-02

It has taken me three days to sit down and figure out what it is that I wanted to write about this book.  I won't begin to recap the book because many others have done it, and I think that knowing too much about this book will handicap the reader.  Go into this raw, don't read too much about it.<br /><br />This book packs an emotional punch, but it is a punch that is strangely distant, and for me it faded rather quickly.  Perhaps it is because I guessed the plots twists before they happened, but I don't think so.  I think it is because there is a difference between American and German authors.  This work was translated into English and it came across a little too distant for me. I understand the events in the book forced the author to step back, but it was too much for me.  The lack of direct emotion was strangely oft-putting to me.<br /><br />The book is moving, but it is the Chinese food kind of moving.  You will be hungry for something emotional rather quickly.  It is well written and technically sound novel, but too sanitary.	2004-09-21

Also, I am sure others have and why do it again?<br /><br />What I will tell you is my impression and the tone of the book.  This book, like all of Ellroy's books the atmosphere practically jumps off the page.  Without being wordy like some authors he manages to set the scene, the emotion and the feel in just a few sentences.  This book is dark, it is fiery, but more than that is shockingly emotional.  It isn't overt, and it takes a second read to really feel it, but there is a subtext to the characters that most will lose in the action and the Ellroyisms.  There is good action, there is snappy dialogue and there are a few twists.<br /><br />I will say this as the only negative.  For some reason Ellroy telegraphs the ending, and that was bothersome.  I didn't mind too much because to read Ellroy is to appreciate the road not the destination.  Read this book, it is worth the time.	2004-08-18

I am just going to give you my opinion on this book I read about ten years ago.<br /><br />When I was in college I picked up this book completely as a fluke.  It looked interesting, I am big into history and the book jacket peaked my interest.  From the first moment I started to read I couldn't put it down.  I carried it to the kitchen five hours later while I threw together a sandwich and read while the bread toasted.  I read all night and into the next day. I blew off my classes.  I didn't do anything else but read.  When I was done that afternoon I was not exhausted as one would think.  I was exhilarated.  This book is so well written, so complex, so dark, so funny, so much more than the average book I was physically excited.<br /><br />Over the next few months my friends read it and each one read it with the same kind of fervor I did.  People who hated to read loved this book.<br /><br />READ IT!  BUY IT!  Do not hesitate.  If you love a good book then you will completely flip out over this one!  It is truly an amazing book and one of the best pieces of fiction ever.  I cannot tell you strong enough how wonderful this treasure is for someone who loves to read.  It is a perfectly written novel.	2004-08-18

It is also in introspective look at Howard Stern's formative years.  You want to know what constantly yelling at your kid and calling him stupid will do, read this book.<br />This book has at least three laughs per page.  When I first read this it was on a train back to college.  I had my headphones on and this book in my hands.  People must have thought I was insane because I was laughing hysterically almost constantly.  I couldn't help it!  I recently reread the book because it was on my bookshelf and I hadn't read it in so long.  I laughed AGAIN hysterically, this time on a long flight.  I have never laughed and smiled more at a book than this one.  It is perfect for what it is designed for...FUN!!<br />Lay back, relax and laugh.

The most interesting thing about this book is the immense difficulty he had selling his stories and the desperate poverty in which he lived for years as a struggling writer. I guess like all people I kind of thought that someone this brilliant was just embraced by literary circles, and any problems he had was because he was a drunken, drugged out, crazy freak who upset everyone who tried to help him. This was not the case.<br />Like many geniuses Hunter was so far ahead of everyone that he had to wait for them to catch up.<br />The humor is so funny that it almost impossible not to crack up on every page, even in the midst of terrible personal turmoil Hunter was one funny man.<br />ONE problem, I wish that there were more letters FROM the people he wrote to over the years. Some of the funniest moments were the letters he received from people over the years. More of those exchanges would have helped and made the book much more interesting. That is why it is not 5 stars. It is still worth reading. Especially if you want to be a writer.	2003-04-25

I can't say that I was bowled over by this book, but I think a beginner would find it very helpful. The only really good critique I can give of this book is that it is not for the intermediate to expert researcher. Most will find it a bit pedestrian and very basic.

I am a huge fan! I love his work and not just the Godfather. I think the Sicilian was a great book destroyed by a poor movie.<br />That being said, this is NOT a great Puzo novel, heck, it isn't a great novel for anyone. There are some classic Puzo moments, but it eventually falls flat and I even had a hard time finishing it.<br />I am not an elitist that thinks Puzo is trash literature, just the opposite, I am a fan, but this is just not good.

Thompson wrote more novels. This book races along at pace that would make a cop on a high speed pursuit look painfully slow. The most impressive aspect of this book is the great wit and laugh out loud humor that is routinely displayed on every page. Even events that you shouldn't be laughing at seem absolutely hilarious because of his writing style. The writing is so crisp, so condensed that every word actually means something, which is refreshing in modern novels. James Ellroy would not only be proud of this book, I think if he ever read it he might think he actually wrote it. The style is so much the same it is almost scary.<br />I love this book and I thinkeveryone should read it. Buried beneath 1000 gallons of cheap rum is a morality tale and good old fasioned tragedy, just with the typical Thompson tilt. It is a wonderful book and it will be something that you will take from the shelf and read every once in a while when you need to laugh at this sick and depraved world.	2003-03-25

Also, the story is so strange but decently written you keep thinking that it will get better eventually. Well, it doesn't. This is not to say that it is a terrible book, not at all, but it is not a great book. Hell, it is barely a good book, but it does have its moments.

This is the first book that I have recommended for the Pulitzer, and this book richly deserves the honor and many more to be heaped upon it.<br />This book is a fascinating and well researched book, but it is much more than that.  It is funny, smartly written and so entertaining that the book is actually a real page turner.  The book is a real eye opener to the inner workings of the Chicago mafia and their dealings with the upperworld and political figures spanning 50 years.  This book is shocking!  The Outfit describes in great detail the association between the mafia and Truman, Lyndon Johnson, The Kennedy's, and numerous state and federal officials.<br />The book also details the life of Curly Humphreys, the most important mob figure, Tony Accardo, Paul Ricca, Johnny Rosselli, Sam &quot;Momo&quot; Giancana, and Al Capone.  The book is rich in details of their lives, it tells of all their exploits and describes their murders, rackets, and other operations.  The book breaks down myths and realities regarding certain aspects of their businesses.  They talk about the control of unions, the fixing of the Kennedy election, Las Vegas, and various other well known mob exploits that are often surrounded in modern day folklore.<br />This book is absolutely excellent and it will give you straight facts, which is the most amazing aspect.  While entertaining, it is extensively researched which is the best part of the book.<br />I highly recommend this book, you will not be disappointed.	2002-08-02

I won't recap the book, that has been done repeatedly, I will just give my thoughts.<br />1) When did King and Straub become John Steinbeck?  Out of the first 100 pages at least half was dedicated to scenery.  It was way too much detail and it felt, and it was, completely unnecessary filler.<br />2) The bikers were good, but you could never really feel for them because you always learned about them not of them by them. We met everyone else in the town practically, but they couldn't have spent a chapter of raven flying in and out of their homes to give us a better feel of the people?  I couldn't understand that for the life of me, especially when Doc and Beezer are going to be major characters!<br />3) The book took over 590 pages of 624 to get into the Black House!!  They spent more time on scenery of places that we never visited, then they did in the finale of the book!<br />4) There should have been an extended chapter earlier on describing the Black House and the machinery, because when the machinery happens, you are not really sure what is going on. The Big Combination?  Where in the world did that come from?  The author mentions that seeing the house is like a dream so much is forgotten.  Nice try.  That is called Lazy.  Gorg could have shown us the house and not been affected, plus it would have given more clarity to the ending.<br />5) 400+ pages to have the name of Roland mentioned.  This combined with the weak, and I think commercially driven, tie in to the wonderful Dark Tower series seemed forced and in many places nonsensical.  I will reserve complete judgment on that until the 5th Dark Tower book comes out, and it better have Jack and Ty in it or I am re-rating this book a 2.  I only gave the 3rd star in the hope that this is leading to something pretty cool in the next Dark Tower installment.<br />6) There was not enough time in the Faraway/Territories, and the few, and I mean FEW pages should have been used better to explain the Black House further and give the book more depth.<br />7) The Fisherman needed more time spent on his background as well.<br />I could keep going but I only have limited time.  Overall, in my opinion, this book is severely lacking and extremely disappointing.  I wasn't thrilled with the 4th Dark Tower book, and I am outright bothered by this pitiful attempt, I am really hoping that King brings it all together for a fantastic book 5 of The Dark Tower.  That would make this book slightly better.  On it's own, or as a fan of the Talisman, I say stay away.  It is like being a fan of The Godfather and then seeing Godfather III, it takes something away from the first one.  Re-read the Talisman and forget about this book.  The only reason to read it is if you a Dark Tower fan like I am.There was not enough time in the Faraway/Territories, and the few, and I mean FEW pages should have been used better to explain the Black House further and give the book more depth.<BR>7) The Fisherman needed more time spent on his background as well.<br />I could keep going but I only have limited time.

I will say that as good as this book is, and it is very good, and as good as Ellroy is, and he is very good, this book fell short of my expectations.<br />I rather like his style of writing, but one thing bothered me.  this may sound trivial, but after a while it is down right annoying: everyone released bodily fluids or threatened too every time they got scared, and they got scared way too often.  Even the really hardcore, stone cold killers we have met before, they are always relieving themselves into their pants. why?

I won't recap the book, others have done that better than I would, I will only tell you my thoughts on this installment.<br />I think that 800 pages was excellent and all the books should be this long, but I think that the story of Roland's love and loss went on for way too long and the Wizard story was laughably too short.  King went on and on in the love story talking about everything, even if it was relevant or not, but the wizard section only received about 10 pages and that whole part felt unbelievably forced.<br />Which is really a shame because the first three books were really something special and the Drawling OF Three was particularly good.<br />Well not all books can be a winner, and I will be patiently waiting for the next book.

I have read the first 3 books in 5 days.  I am glad that I didn't read them when they came out because I just started the fourth one and I am already sad that there isn't another one (yet) that I can just run out and buy.<BR>That being said, and that I will not recap the story just give you my opinion, I loved this book but I felt a bit unsatisfied. The book definitely moved very quick, and had lots of action, but for me it moved too quickly.  Like King would be punished if the paperback version went over 600 pages.  I would have liked it if he stayed in the two towns, especially Lud, for a longer period of time.  It took 500 pages to get to Lud and less that fifty to get out, not including the train part.  For me this was not enough, and I would have appreciated some time in those towns.  Again, to me, I feel like since King pumps out so many books that this one got short shrift.  What was written was excellent and I enjoyed myself thoroughly, but I didn't feel the way I felt at the end of The Drawling of Three where I NEEDED to continue, I still want to, but it is not as complete a feeling.  On the plus side, Jake coming back was just what the story needed and his character is really a breath of fresh air to the story, and without him this installment would not be nearly as exciting or rich in its delivery. The action was rushed but well presented and made for some good reading. Some more time was deserved on Roland's attempts to find Jake in Lud, that part felt woefully incomplete, but other than that it was a good action story.<BR>All an all this is a very good series, and I am having a great reading experience, but this book just needed some more to it and I would have been much more satisfied.	2002-07-09

The Gunslinger was a nice beginning, raw and a little uneven, but The Drawling of Three more than compensated. I won't bother recapping the book, because others have and it would give too much away, but I will tell you that I read this book in a day and a half.  I couldn't put it down.  It was like the down slope of a roller coaster, once it took off there was no stopping it!  The characters truly come alive and the addition of the supporting cast really begins to add a much needed rich texture the story.  the reader will not know where or when this saga will end, but one this is for sure, when you read this installment you will be hooked.  I enjoyed the first book, The Gunslinger, but this book has totally and completely hooked me for good.  No matter how many books King writes in this legacy I will read them.	2002-07-07

I first discovered the work of Charles Bukowski approximately five years ago, and I was immediately impressed.  The more I read the more I enjoyed.  I had heard all the legendary tales, the horror stories and the millions of tales of drunken mania, but I purposely stayed away from reading anything ABOUT the man.  I didn't want to be disappointed when the reality is often times a far cry from the truth.<br />Eventually I broke down and bought this book, simply because the countless stories of his life were really becoming too much, and I wanted to know a little more about the man.  If at all possible, from an independent observer who was not a Bukowski crony.  I think this book accomplishes the task of being a reasonably detached look at the life of a complicated individual, with a few complaints.<br />First, the author obviously fell in love with Bukowski during this book (or perhaps before he even wrote it), and it shows constantly.  There are admitted mistakes in his life, but the real warts are brushed over rather quickly.<br />Second, the book felt rushed.  I think the book would have been much better if the author took his time and wrote a comprehensive 500-700 page book, which he obviously could have done.  There are more than enough things to write about.  Whole accounts of his womanizing and his time with the LA Free Press are just glanced over.  I think it cheated the reader<br />Lastly, the author quickly passes over the interpersonal relationships Bukowski formed and spoke almost exclusively of events.  Events don't tell us the whole story, and what he did write about the relationships was shallow at best.  Linda King was the only one who had any depth added.  The lack of interpersonal discussions really failed to bring out the third dimension in this book, and it fell a little flat.<br />The good thing for the author is that he writes well, and thankfully, Charles Bukowski is an interesting subject.  I find it hard to believe anyone could really make his life boring.  So the book is worth reading, especially if you are like me and don't know much about the man, but if you do I think the reader might find this a bit overly simplistic.<br />If I could have I would have rated this a 3.5 star book.

I think they will be fascinated to see the thought process behind the actions, and that is where this book really shines.<br />I do warn all casual readers, that I don't see this book as being something most will enjoy.  It is long, it is dry and sometimes it is down right boring, but that is the nature of politics.<br />For people who are extremely interested in Chinese Political Strategy, Cultural Political Strategy, Political Science or Governmental Procedures, this will be a real page turner.  Luckily, I enjoy these topics and make a living off of such ideas and subjects, but my friends who do not did not enjoy the book as much as I did.  Which is why I give it 4 stars, a five star book would have attempted to make this read more accessible to the masses, and add more commentary about what the readers were reading to increase their understanding.  To fully grasp all that is going on you must know a good deal of Post-Communist Chinese history.<br />If any of this sounds fun for you this book is a treasure, if not, I suggest waiting for a good program on the History Channel.	2002-06-28

In very plain, simple and easy to read language it makes a clear bridge between the art of business and the art of warfare.<br />Some will say that this book is too simplistic, but the real question is why would this book have to be difficult or too involved?  The Art of War is a simply written book, but it is the lessons that are hard to grasp and understand.  Plain language does not automatically denote simple thoughts.  The best authors and teachers in the world are the ones who can simplify the most difficult theories and make them accessible to everyone.<br />I think this book does just that and is an excellent beginning point for businessmen and their introduction to The Art of War and Chinese philosophy.	2002-06-24

Most books are simply the translation of the book, but no real explanation to go along with the text.  Some give some side notes or a long introduction, but the text itself can be difficult and little or no help is given.<br />This is not the case with this edition, and that is why it is head and shoulders above all others I have looked at.  It begins with a lengthy introduction to acquaint readers to the book and give some very necessary background information.  Next is the full translation, GREATLY helped by the recently discovered bamboo remains of the book dug up in China, and there is no commentary in this section of the book.  Which is excellent for people well acquainted with the work, people who want to read the work without the running commentary, students and scholars.  Next are three sections designed to help the read fully understand the text in which they have just read.  Not just the ideas about war, but it's applications in many other walks of life.  These chapters explain difficult Chinese concepts, the idea of a sage leader, and many, many, other relevant topics.<br />Lastly, is the commentary.  This is where the entire work is reviewed and detailed notes are given to help the reader understand the text LINE BY LINE!!  It is not judgmental, while there is a slight bias, it is mostly informative.  The bias does not distract from the educational part of the information, but it does need to be pointed out.  I will not go into greater detail, the reader can extrapolate from the commentary if they feel there is a slight tinge of bias.<br />Overall this is the one and only edition of the Art of War you will ever need to own, unless you are going to venture into more scholarly pursuits on the subject and you want to review other peoples ideas surrounding the text.  This book will be sufficient for 99.99% of the people in the general public.  It is an exceptional effort.general public.  It is an exceptional effort.	2002-06-24

I am not going to review all the information in the book, it has been reviews capably by others, I am just going to give my thoughts on the book.<br />First of all I would like to say that I am not Jewish or Catholic and I have no bias whatsoever against either group, and I am in a Ph.D. program for International Diplomacy so I am very familiar with many aspects covered in this book.  Still, I was stunned, deeply saddened and extremely angry when I was done reading this book, and I believe with good reason.<br />I had heard about the connection with the Catholic Church and the Nazis for years but I always thought of it as Oliver Stone type material, but no after reading this book.  This book was an extremely well researched, scholarly effort originally designed by the devout Catholic author to remove Pius from blame.  That intention being mentioned in the beginning of the book makes the rest of the book all the more shocking and respectable.  This is not a man with an axe to ground this is a person of faith struggling to come to grips with a despicable incident in the annals of his faith.<br />It is extremely well written and heartfelt.  It is moving and touch while at the same time being extremely informative.  There can be no dispute in anyone's mind that Pope Pius XII did not do anything of any substance to help the Jews, and why? He was scared. With good reason.  Pius isn't a villain, but he is no hero and no saint.  This book rips apart Catholic dogma about the infallibility of the Pope, etc.  It is a thorough expose, that if it was a boxing match the ref would have stopped the fight early on.  Still, chapter after chapter more and more evidence piles on top of the Catholic church and their denials become even more hollow.<br />I read an apologist book after this just to see what they could possibly say in defense of themselves and it was laughable.  This book stays with you. It educates you.  It should be read by everyone, but especially religious people in Politics as a warning.<br />Pius XII could have stood up and did the right thing, but fear and greed prevent him from doing so, and as a result millions died.  He might not have been able to stop it but we will never know because he NEVER tried.<br />READ THIS BOOK!!as a warning.<BR>Pius XII could have stood up and did the right thing, but fear and greed prevent him from doing so, and as a result millions died.

As usual with my reviews I will not try and recap the entire book because it has been done several times before, I will just give you my thoughts as a student of history.<br />The old saying that there are three sides to every story is played out in front of the readers eyes in Nanking.  For the novice this book will look like a well documented support for massacre, not a holocaust.  To the expert it will look like a capable by deeply flawed defense of the indefensible.  I happened to believe that it is somewhere in the middle.  I do not believe the Chinese estimate of 350,000 killed and 80,000 women raped, but I know enough from precious readings to realize that the numbers quoted here are much lower than what really happened, in all likelihood.<br />What I disliked about this, and what really makes me upset is the way the author sets about discounting \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" to an audience aimed at Japanese citizens around the world. In Japan \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" was not allowed to be published at the time this book came out.  I am not sure the book is allowed to be printed in Japan as of yet.  This author slanders the book, takes references out of context, omits facts that might undermined his case and is obviously biased against the book and it's findings.<br />It is revisionist history and it is dangerous because it is written well.  IF you read this please read \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" as well, then YOU can decide which side to take.  I also think you will take the third side, the middle ground. Just how far to each side of the middle you will swing is up to the reader.	2002-06-19

I won't bother reviewing the book extensively, because the other reviews and the Amazon summary does a great job, but I would like to add a few thoughts.<br /> When I was a child I heard about A Season In Hell. I first heard about in Rimbaud in an utterly forgettable movie, but now I must remember it because it introduced me to the greatest Poet who ever lived. I read the poem and I didn't understand much of it, but what I did understand is that it was hauntingly beautiful, and wonderfully depraved. Almost twenty years later I still don't understand all of the poem, and my opinion has not changed. Still I didn't know much about the man except that he faked his own death. I read bits of information, part of a biography that was poorly written, and I sadly gave up on this story for years. When a friend recommended this book, not for Rimbaud, he accidentally got it in a book of the month club and decided to read it, but because it was a great book. To which I wholeheartedly agree. It is more than just a book about a genius and a poet, but it is a wonderfully written book filled with dry humor and insightful commentary.<br />Best of all for the lovers of literature and fact, this book dispels many, many myths about Arthur Rimbaud while still keeping true to the demonic young man and his disreputable behavior and youth fueled fury. I will say that sometimes the book felt more like a love letter, and the author did hold back a bit, but only rarely and only in words not in thought...<br />Read this book because it is a great book about a great man.<br />*WARNING* This book will make you think, and may even make your life seem small in comparison! It is a great motivator for all of us with wandering spirits, fanciful dreams, but sedentary lives.	2002-06-04

The most amazing part is that you will be despised by your former friends for telling the truth and trying to help people realize the liberal bent in the news.<br />The most important thing about the book is that Mr. Goldberg relies on his 30+ years in the media to give some shocking and appalling examples of liberal media bias.  It is extensively researched, provides precise examples, charts, and graphs all leading to one inevitable conclusion.  Anyone who doesn't believe that should read his section on AIDS and the media and you will be amazed at the lack of so-called Liberal compassion when it came to the diverging viewpoints on aids.  The homelessness issue talks about how the media PURPOSELY reported on only white, formerly middle class, clean and sober people who were now homeless.  Instead of reporting fairly and accurately that this awful problem has more to do with race and mental stability than people would like to admit.  This book will stun people with its facts, figures and examples.<br />I am a liberal and I absolutely believe Mr. Goldberg and I think he writes a compelling book. Others have reviewed it extensively, so I will not do the same, but I will say that this book needs to be read.<br />Every American who reads magazines and newspapers, watches television news or reads theirs off the internet MUST read this book to help them gain a little perspective on their news content.<br />Mr. Goldberg did a courageous thing by writing this easy to read, fun well documented and well written book, the least we can do is read it. Anyone who wants to be part of the well informed populous will read this book. Others can bury their head in the sand and hope this question of bias goes away, but I don't think it will.	2002-05-28

His writing style is very dramatic and extremely vivid.  Most importantly since this book is about a REAL trial, he is about as fair and detached as one could be considering the subject and the despicable nature of David Irving.  Mr. Guttenplan goes out of his way, almost as if he doesn't want to be the next person hauled into court, to be very fair and give the pseudo-historian David Irving the benefit of the doubt. Make no mistake, he finds Irving repellant and his position on the holocaust abhorrent and unconvincing.  Despite this he tries to be fair, and he does a good job.<br />If people like history mixed with some flair, some drama, and some excellently written plot devices, you will love this book and actually LEARN something!!<br />I read it in 4 days, and I was thinking about it when I wasn't reading the book.  It will stay with you. Despite his misguided introduction on the nature of history and his questionable conclusion on the same subject, the trial part (over 90% of the book) is fabulous.	2002-05-28

Some will dismiss it as total and utter junk, other will believe every word of it. Most of us will be intrigued, enjoy the excellent writing and spectacular pictures, but be left unsure. I know at the end of this book I WANTED TO BELIEVE MORE THAN I WANTED TO BELIEVE ANYTHING ABOUT HISTORY!!<br />I want to believe that the human race could do all of these fantastic things in such an organized, precise way thousands of years before the great civilizations of the Romans and the Greeks. I really do! I want to believe that we are all tied together in a way that united us and makes up proud of the human race and its dizzying array of achievements. I want to believe that our ancestors tamed the seas, knew advanced calculus, astronomy, physics, building techniques, etc. I think this book gives great hope for mankind and demonstrates how special human beings are.<br />That being said, do I agree with all Hancock's theory? Answer: I don't know, but it made one hell of a read, and for that I thank him.<br />Trust me when I tell you that this book is worth reading, worth thinking about and important in a small way (possibly an extremely large way) about the history of humanity.

Now that should be known so any future readers who don't want to support this kind of propaganda or ultraconservative organization. It also lets you know what you are getting yourself into before you buy it.<br />That being said Jasper makes some interesting and provocative points, but they are lost in paranoid ramblings.  In my opinion the direct quotes he uses are chilling and deserve consideration for anyone who opposes the UN becoming THE global superpower.  Anyone who opposes a one world government can find some nuggets of useful information, but will be irritated by the writing.<br />Jasper is a terrible writer and repeats himself constantly. He also makes the cardinal mistake when it comes to propaganda, make it palatable for the middle of the road readers.  You have to be REALLY far gone to enjoy this book.<br />There HAS to be a better book about the UN than this one.  All this is a bunch of paranoid ramblings about a one world government.

This book is amazing on so many different levels I am not really sure where to begin. It is an amazingly well written, compelling, insightful, and utterly fascinating book on it's own. Fortunately, it is so much more than just a really well written book, it is TRUE story that everyone needs to read. It is book about a true hero, a courageous man who risked his life and his reputation to save tens of millions of lives. I don't really want to give too much away, but it answers a question that many World War 2 historians want to know: WHY didn't the Germans create the Atomic Bomb? Well, there is one word for why, Heisenberg. This man stayed in Germany and deliberately sabotaged the Nazi's attempts to make the bomb.<br />In a world where people struggle to find heroes and gather up courage it is a shame not many people know this story. I think many people would be amazed at the sacrafices one very proud man would endure to save the world. Please read this book, you will not be disappointed.	2002-02-13

It was a good history lesson, but not what I wanted.  There was as much on George Washington as there was on Cincinniatus.  It did a very good job of detailing the early period of the Roman city-state, and it did an excellent job of discussing the servant ideal, but there are some flaws.<br />This book could have easily been 90-120 pages and it would have garnished a higher rating in my review.  The author continuously said the same thing over and over again in three or four different ways, I presume only to add filler to the book.  It didn't do it in a way that you believed the author was trying to convey an important message and thus the reason for it's repetition.  It just seemed to be the same stories told several times to make the book longer.  That really irritated me after a while and made the book more difficult to stay attached to the material during the reading.<br />Also, the author says that the details of Cincinnatus's life are sketchy at best, but then makes wild conclusions about his thoughts and feelings base on little or no evidence.  It tended to feel like hero worship for the sake of hero worship.  I have NO doubt that Cincinnatus was a great man and it is truly a shame that most people don't know who he is, but this book while trying to convey his humanity tends to do the opposite.  It's constant reverence and idolization of him made it feel almost a like a fable, instead of a true and amazing story.  Something the author didn't want to do, and expressly said so many times in the book.<br />I do think people should read this book, I did read it in two days, I did enjoy parts of it tremendously, BUT it is far from perfect.  The author and the editor have a lot of work to do in perfecting their craft.  Don't let that stop you from reading this book, ESPECIALLY if you are a leader or wish to attain a leadership position one day.

Diplomacy is more detailed and filled with such insight that leaves every one of my textbooks or required readings in the dust.  The first half of this book talks about European politics and the evolution though World War II.  It is so richly detailed that I know every time I read it after this I will glean more useful information and facts.<br />the second half discusses the United States and it's emergence as a superpower until the end of the cold war and the first Bush administration.<br />Even if you disagree with his conclusions and ideas it is a fascinating read and great insight to American diplomats.  Kissinger does not pull many punches in this book.  The fault of the French in the 1800's, the fault of the Germans in the first half of the 1900's, the fault of the British and their detachment from Europe, the missteps of American foreign policy and it's times of isolation.

This is not to say that if you are a fan of these authors that you can't tell who's chapters are who's, I am just saying that it works.  Also reading the book and being able to tell who is writing the chapters makes the book that much more enjoyable to the true fan.<br />This book is good it doesn't deserve a lengthy review just a dramatic plea, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK! It is true brilliance unlike much else that has been written, especially in this genre.	2001-11-17
US	40643416	RZ2ZEO6GG9TKC	0671869205	680068737	Truman	Books	5	5	6	N	N	The Greatest President of All Time	This book is so much more than the tale of the united States greatest President, it is an example of a man who was not born to be great but nonetheless was exceptional. Harry Truman was born in a very simple town to very simple, but extremely hardworking parents. I don't mean to imply that they were stupid, because they most certainly were not, they we just not caught up in much more than farming. Harry was smart and funny and sweet as a child but was no push over. He grew to me a man of convictions and the willingness to fight for those principles even if it meant his life.<br />Harry Truman is an example for all of us in how to conduct ourselves and to never let our humble beginnings limit out desires or our potential. he worked hard, he read and he studied, but more than that he had a way of making up his mind and sticking with his gut feelings.<br />When I read this book I only admired Harry Truman the President of the United States, but after reading this book I learned to care for Harry S. Truman the man.<br />This book is a beautiful and uplifting biography of someone who truly deserves to have his story told, and their aren't man of those.<br />In this day and age where, and the political climate we are in now, this book, and more importantly this man, is essential to read.  Harry Truman, right or wrong, accepted responsibility and spoke plainly and honestly to the American public.  It is refreshing and exhilirating compared to the politicians of today, in both parties.  Reading this book actually made me believe, or want to believe, in the goodness of people who enter public service.  Nowadays I wonder how many politics see this as public service?  Harry Truman did.  That is what makes this man worth reading about.<br />Read this book and you will love life and respect the human potential just that much more.	2001-11-16

Imagine being asked to write the a book on one of the most difficult mathematical subjects...and to do it for the layman.  This is what Zero does and it does it well.  George Seife takes us through the history of zero and makes it come alive.<br />After a while you start to think of Zero as an underdog hero that needs to be saved and restored to it's rightful place.  Like a peasant king who needs to be restored to the throne.  You care for Zero, you want Zero to succeed and more than that you UNDERSTAND Zero and the long strange journey it has gone through.<br />I bought this book for family and friends after reading it because it is a real lesson un understanding something that may not seem that complex.  It is a history lesson, but more importantly it is a humanity lesson.  I though this book was outstanding.<br /><br />This book finds the way to do the remarkable, to make math interesting, accessible to everyone and EXCITING!  The long and winding history of Zero is one that everyone should read because it is a great story of intellectual advenacements and the dangers of having a closed mind.  It also provides a background no one would dream of when the word \\"Zero\\" is mentioned.  Remarkable.	2001-11-11
