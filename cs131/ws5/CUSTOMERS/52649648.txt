Its one of those books that you cannot put down.  Its like an addiction, so plan to stay up late.<br />A young boy learns who his family is for the first time.  He has many questions, and they only tell him a little bit at a time.  Confused, angry, and full of questions he continues to poke and prod his aunt and Mr. Wolf to try to figure out &quot;who he really is&quot;... and when he finds out, he wishes he could be that little boy in Aunt Pol's kitchen once again.  We've all been kids at one point in time, and this will make you remember the frustrations of being a teenager, and the confusions of your emotions.<br />Garion begins to learn and to grow as the story goes on.  Eddings creates a powerful world of colors and sounds, and mystical powers.  Everyone in this story is important, everyone must be there, and events take place for a reason.  It just happens to be a reason that Garion doesn't yet understand, and his family refuses to tell him &quot;until he gets older.&quot;<br />A great story.  Its like &quot;the wizard of oz&quot; of fantasy novels.  Its a must read, and must read again and again.	2004-01-09

The story (beginning in Vol 1) is your classic good vs. evil.  For those who have read the Belgaraid Vol 1. this is a must have.  For those that are reading the review, but have not read Vol 1. (or the three books that it comprises) then stop, find it, and buy them both!<br />Why?  Learn how a young immature boy, and a young spoiled girl grow up &quot;the hard way&quot; with conflicts, battles, and hard lessons learned.  They grow up fast, and become very memorable characters.  Eddings does an amazing job fleshing out the characters in the Novel.  Everyone has a personality, everyone has a reason to be there.  Even the story itself seems to speak to you as if it is a stand-alone character.<br />If you like fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings (JRR), Icewind Dale (Salvatore), The Magician (Feist), etc. then you'll love these books.	2004-01-08

The simple answer is yes.  I was also concerned based on some of the reviews I've read here about how the book didn't develop many of the other characters encountered in the book.  All I have to say is &quot;Talon of the Silver Hawk&quot; is the name of the book, and that's what its all about.  This book is a story about Talon, and everyone else is described from Talon's point of view.<br />The books storyline is very secretive and mysterious.  Talon knows very little of his new life after the incident with his tribe, and this book describes his confusion and lifestyle in the big wide world around him.  He must develop new skills, enhance old skills, and become a master of swordsmanship.  The question is &quot;why?&quot;.  After being taken under the wing of the Conclave his new life has many questions, and many unknown goals.  Lifes an open book for Talon, and its not all his choice on how that book is written.<br />This book got better when a few old characters are introduced.  Not because the story was mediocre, but because I feel more comfortable when a few old faces make their way into the weave of the story.  It helps give perspective.<br />The book seems to take place roughly 30 years after the fall of Krondor (and its rebuilding).  Many of the past wars have become tales and stories told around the fire.  To really feel comfortable with the storyline and the timeline I highly suggest starting from &quot;Magician: Apprentice&quot; and reading through all of Feist's books before moving into this book.  You will feel more like you're part of the story and have lived the life the historic tales.<br />I highly recommend this book for followers of Feist, even if you have not read the past books in awhile.  I'm not finished the book yet, but I was glad to see a few of my favorite mysterious wizards return.  Would you like an Orange? :-)	2003-09-28

A don't think I really cared for that part.  The book often seemed jumpy and characters were brought into the book, and others taken out far to quickly for me.  One chapter may be about one thing, and then near the end an entire different topic jumps into the picture.  Perhaps if I was more prepared for this it would have been easier.  Until page 250 or so I was easily lost, and didn't find it a very big &quot;page turner&quot;.<br />The second downfall for me was that I had not read book II in about a year.  Leaving me lost when certain characters were re-introduced.  Unlike R.A Salvatore who tends to go into a paragraph of re-introductions to help you along, Elaine leaves it up to you to figure it out.  I used to think the 'flashback' &quot;last we saw him...&quot; type effect was a waste of pages, now I believe its a good addition to fill the years gap from book to book.  Elaine could have used that method to keep me up-to-date, but she didn't.  So I recommend re-reading the last book to make this one a little more interesting and easier to read.<br />Now, on to the good stuff.  I was very happy to see the odd twists Elaine used for her wizard drow against her former godess Lolth.  The symbolic battle between three gods over a single human was a neat addition to the book.  Leaving you wondering &quot;what happens next&quot; with the god's struggle to get the favor of Liriel.  Her battle with her former priestess adversary ended in a suprising result.  Showing that the most intelligent drow can understand how easily they can fall prey to &quot;vengence&quot; -- the drows worse enemy (and usual cause for death).<br />Although the book shuffles fast through events, the last hundred pages or so are specific to what I think the story was all about.  How Liriel learns from those around her, what tasks she has in life, and where her friends really are.<br />Were too many great characters killed within this book?  No.  A good novel has great villans and great heros.  If they all were to survive what would we gain from the story?  Liriel doesn't live in a life of peace and harmony, and the death around her reflect that.  When the drow are involved there is always going to be a large death count.  That's just how it has to be.<br />....Sometimes your dreams of being a wizard are cut short by the knife in the back....s killed within this book?

It was more intellectual then many novels of today (esp. in the genre we're talking about here).  It was more beefy in content, dialect, language, and history.<br />I give it five stars for creative design and interaction.  I was able to &quot;believe&quot; this could have really happened.  Awesome.<br />If I may compare (although its a stretch) I compare this book to more of the intellectual level of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; where many others of its kind are at the &quot;Harry potter&quot; intellectual level.  If you love to read and like Forever Knight then this book is for you.  If you read just to pass the time... not a good pick.	2003-08-16

Salvatore's War of the Spider Queen, Book 3)	Books	4	16	16	N	N	A good story, and I can't complain	First off, for those that are reading this review to know if they should 'go on' in the series should stop right now and buy it.  No matter how good this book is, it is a *must have* to continue the saga.<br />Secondly, I enjoyed the book.  I was not bothered by anything in the style of writing such as the combat scenes, or character development.  I believe this author gave more life and humor to some of the characters.  Pharaun and Valas seemed to pickup a sense of humor in this book as compared to some of the prior books.  Although some characters did not develop to a high degree, they assisted in pushing the storyline and the author spent more time on group interaction between the main Drow party.  Overall a different author helps give you more experience with other writing styles.<br />It seems to me that each author does his best to make Quenthel more and more bitchy and &quot;drow priestess&quot; like. :)  Each book she gets on my nerves more and more.  Like a little spoiled girl with way to much power.  Pharaun seems to act more like a teasing brother during this story.<br />Two things I did not enjoy which keep me from adding that last star:<br />1. The paper book cover over the hardcover novel is way to small and it makes the book hard to open, and slides off easily.  Not a problem with Salvatores hardcover &quot;Demon War Series&quot;.  I just took it off while I read it (defeating the purpose of course).<br />2. Unless I am reading it wrong on page 315 the author writes: &quot; 'Save your magic', Quenthel decided.  'That strand will do.  Jeggred, Ryld, carry Valas and Danifae'&quot;  -- what?  Jeggred is not even in the group in this scene, but back on the material plane while they are in the outer planes.... type-o?  Pretty big inconsistency if I read that right...<br />Other then that, Its worth the money.  Buy it, read it, and enjoy every minute.	2003-08-16

By now you're probably feeling that you know Mara like a sister, and that you understand the pain she's going through.  This book doesn't make your pains go away :)<br />The hardest problem I've always had with these books is that Mara seems always to be given the shaft when it comes to problems.  I guess that's what a &quot;leader&quot; is all about, but still :)  Yes, she's lucky, yes she gets out of all kinds of jams, but not always without a scar.<br />This book explores areas of the world and expands on the &quot;other side of the rift&quot; by introducing a few new culters and sheding light on others.  We finally leave the little microcosim of the Acoma and the few cities that have been ventured, and move out beyond the boundaries.<br />What makes this book so powerful?  Maras battle with the wizards.  There is no book I've read from Feist thus far that really challenges the counsel of mages as this one does.  They're always looked upon as special, and god like.  Now we see exactly what they are capable of, cards on the table.  Now its time to put up or shut up.  Will they put up and destroy the lady?  Will the lady let their powerful ego's go unchecked?  Or shall she destroy them and put them in their rightful place after hundreds of years?  What is it that makes them so strong?  What secrets are they hiding from the people?<br />By the end, you will understand exactly what is going on in this odd &quot;japanese style&quot; world, and what a 'black robe' is all about.	2003-07-14

All your great heroes are in this book (that are still alive of course), so there isn't any excuse not to read it.<br />I believe that the fast pace action and build up finally exploded in the last 48 pages.  It was amazing, I continued reading and getting close to the end going &quot;um, how can Salvatore wrap this up in 48 pages?&quot; and believe it or not he did it.  Without giving  away anything I will describe it like this:<br />&quot;Imagine taking all the greatest heros of two wars, two generations, many powerful novels, and combining them into a tragic explosive conflict within only 48 pages of text&quot;<br />Its intense.  I was up till 3am &quot;just finishing the last 30 pages.&quot;  As the end gets closer I continue to ask myself &quot;Ok, now who's going to die?&quot; You never want to see a great Hero die, but with as many characters in a book its hard to keep them all alive without the reader starting to disbelieve :)<br />Expect to say goodbye to some, and hello to others.  Salvatore seems to make sure this war is really wrapped up this time.<br />However, the classic salvatore move is pulled.... leave out vital information when you finally hit that last page.  Asking what happens to [n] people?  Where does [y] go after that occurs?  Could [z] become who they have always wanted to be?  I have a feeling Salvatore left some room for growth with some of the characters to fit them into their own advantures.  Time will tell.	2003-07-14

Salvatore and you've followed the life of Drizzt then this is the next step in your existance.<br />I'd have to agree with Salvatore, though, that its time to give Drizzt and his group a rest.  They've lived life, they've run through adventures that would kill any other person (and has even brought people back from the Abyss!).  Come on, stop telling Salvatore to make Drizzt work harder.  He deserves to retire.<br />But...<br />The book is not nearly as great as The Dark Elf Trilogy, but starts a great tale that can lead to more great adventures.  Your old friends are back, along with some doo dads.  Oi oi!<br />Salvatore spends some time with the Orcish perspective, and follows the story of many different races with all their own preceived notions of the world.<br />I'll let you read it for yourself and decide, but I believe its a great addition to my library.  I'd give this book 4 stars, except for that fact that I want to read the next book now. :)  If it can draw me back into Drizzt world then that's worth another star.	2003-07-14

This book is a great follow-up to the &quot;Daughter of the Empire&quot;.  How can it get any better?  Add in an envious ally wishing revenge upon his dead brother, a blood pact with the Red God, sneaky enemies, and an intelligent plot to bring down the Lady's house around her feet.  If that's not enough, tie in the fact that the Lady finally finds that there is gentle men in the world... even if they might be a simple barbarian slave.  Or perhaps the barbarian isn't so simple minded after all?<br />This book continues where The Daughter of the Empire left off, and builds upon the empire of the Acoma and their still growing rise to power.  But we all know what happens if a house rises too fast in the eyes of the five most powerful houses...<br />My ownly complaint with this book is that the chapters are WAY TOO LONG.

It compares greatly to rest of the Feist collection (starting with the Magician Apprentice).  If you have read all other Fiests books then I suggest this one next.  Much of the story stands alone, although its story takes place in the \\"past\\" (around the time of the first Tsurani invasion force).  It works as a stand alone series and satisfies the folks who want to know more about the Tsurani culture.<br />Learning about the culture, and the dynamics of the empire was very exciting.  Reading of honor bound armies that would rather kill themselves in battle then be taken captured is an interesting concept (very asian in culture).<br />The \\"daughter of the empire\\" is just the start of a great story about a young lady who is forced to come to power and take over her fathers empire with very little experience and training.  If she fails, her honorable house becomes valueless \\"gray warriors\\" with no honor to roam the country side and perhaps die of disease or starvation.  She alone can hold her house in order, or die trying.	2003-03-22

I need a social group	I found book II to be much better then the first book of the set.  This book has more adventure with a complex yet easy to understand plotline.  We're introduced to a few new characters while revisting those from book I.<br />It is hard to adapt to the fact that this is *not* a book about an adventure group of friends... but a group of adventurers together by convention alone.  If things go bad you never know who may backstab who, and everyone is out to protect THEMSELVES.<br />And its about time someone worked a succubus into a storyline :)  I'm a big fan of odd character types, wizardry and magic, and deceit.  This book has all three wrapped up in a nice package of chaos.  And after its all said and done you still get to read about another city besides the ever popular Menzobaranzan!  A new culture with new houses to dominate!  Most excellent.<br />Admittingly, I have not yet finished the book but I'm having a hard time putting it down.  I can't say that about the first book, although it was good, it is not of this quality.  As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to grab some tea and sit down on my comfortable chair and read where I last left off...	2003-01-26

The main problem I had was the jumpy nature of the plots and subplots.  Until three quarters through the book I really couldn't tell you what it was &quot;about&quot; but I could tell you a lot about Drow society.<br />By the last quarter of the book it finally 'clicked' and I could tell you where the series was going to head.  There is a lot of information to absorb in this book, and some nice action scenes.  But overall I'd have to recommend this book soley on the fact that it gives you a great background into the next book (book II) which is an excellent read.<br />If your expecting a &quot;salvatore&quot; book this may not be exactly what  your expecting.  If your expecting a neat adventure into the twisted lives of the dark elf then pick it up or wait until soft cover.	2003-01-26

So rather then having a &quot;vampire&quot; monster they have a template system for turning ANY monster into a vampire in a few simple steps (and have an example of one as well).  Same for the lycanthrope's.<br />You'll find the dragons to be much more powerful in the new Monster Manual (as opposed to 2nd Edition), however they lack a spell list (so you have to look them up in the Players Handbook manually).<br />If your new to the D&amp;D gaming system, then lets just say that this is all you need to fill your dungeons with monsters!	2001-12-22

US	52649648	R2OKN0QAVIV927	1572316950	952707462	Programming Windows with MFC, Second Edition	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Excellent book for developers young and old!	This book covers a great deal of MFC development.  The book starts with a little work with how Win32 programming is done in standard C (see, Charles Petzold's Programming Windows for more).  The book clearly defines the  inner workings of the &quot;windows message pump&quot; and gives the reader  a sense of what environment they are heading into.<br />Warning: If you are  not good in Object Oriented Programming this book is not the first step.  First learn up on C++ and then think about jumping into MFC.<br />The writing  is made clear and understandable at a &quot;user level&quot;.  The code is  sometimes not fully completed (and can be obtained from the included  CDROM), but all examples are clearily described line by line on what is  going on in them.<br />The API's that are described throughout the book will  definatly get you on your way to writing a class A application.  The writer  covers the use of GDI for graphic drawing, Single and Multiple Document  interfaces, and works through almost every control that you have available  in Visual C++ including Rich Edit Controls and Rich Edit Views.  You can  learn to print, write to disk, and access the windows registry (and much  much more)<br />This books constantly gets passed between friends as they all  have begun learning the inner workings of MFC and have left the days of the  &quot;win32 console application&quot;.<br />The book also includes a nice  object oriented hierarchy diagram on the inside front cover of the  Foundation Classes at your disposal.<br />Drawbacks:  1. Some examples use  the Class Wizard, and other Visual C++ &quot;helpers&quot; which lead to  some odd comments in the code, and less &quot;handwritten&quot;  appeal.<br />2. The book is HUGE.  Pretty heavy, and not always easy to read  in a comfortable way.<br />3. Does not give you a 100% understanding of how MS  Windows works internally.  It has a good introduction, but if you want to  know how it all works using MFC to encapsulate the more difficult  functionality is probably not in your best interest.<br />-<br />I suggest both  this book and &quot;Programming Windows 5th Edition&quot; by Charles  Petzold for both C++ &quot;MFC&quot; and standard Win32 C programming.  However, with this book you can write quick and dirty applications in no  time flat!ore difficult  functionality is probably not in your best interest.<br />- <br />I suggest both  this book and &quot;Programming Windows 5th Edition&quot; by Charles  Petzold for both C++ &quot;MFC&quot; and standard Win32 C programming.

I cannot possible ask anyone to read any book more then the Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Hobbit.  No other books have entertained me as much and got my imagination going.  The great storyline, the talented poems and  songs, and all the rest.<br />The only problem is you either find it exciting  or you grow bored quickly.  I have seen both sides, argued my points, and  found it a moot discussion.  if you can get through Book I you're going to  love the rest!	1999-07-13

For those who need a little more detailed look at armor and how it was historically used, this is the book for you.  With illustrations, and information for most items, and a larger table then found in the PHB.  This book will give anyone that extra edge when describing there character.<br />If  your into the historical usage of weapons and armor, and your trying to fit  specific types of armor and weapons to a specific date or setting this will  assist you as the DM.<br />I will only give this 4 of 5 stars because it lacks  the extra knowledge I was seeking for new innovative items, a larger  magical item extension, and campaign examples.  Howerver, with all the  information I would like the book would be a few hundred pages larger, and  would sell for a much higher price.  For it's worth, it's worth it's  weight.	1999-07-12

This book is not the be all end all campaign creator.  I find this book, enjoyable to read (I admire the necromancer class) and a very  excellent addition to building mysterious and dangerous necromancer NPC's  (this book includes an suggested necromancer dragon!).<br />With this book you  can make an NPC to scare your players away, and show them just how powerful  the dark arts really can be.  The warned, this book is mainly for the DM  for creating NPC's.  It is not meant to be used as a Player  &quot;Class&quot; option.  However, I would possible let a player create  one of these unique necromancer kits in the right setting.<br />A must have  for magic user freaks, and a DM looking to add a twist to their adventure.	1999-07-12

I would reference this book as the &quot;bible&quot; of win32 programming.  This book covers many features of the Windows 95/98/NT features including printing, MDI, Mouse, Keyboard, and all the goodies.<br />This book sits upon  my desk as the #1 reference when writing win32 code (without MFC).  If your  new to programming and are thinking about MFC I would consider starting  with this non-object oriented approach so you understand what MFC is doing  behind all the objects.<br />Easy reading (compared to other programming  books) and a great deal of learning can be done.<br />To 4th edition  &quot;Programming Windows 95&quot; owners:<br />1. If you want to use  ToolBar's you better hold on to the last revision because it's missing in  this one.  I was very unhappy about that.<br />2. It's huge!  If you thought  carrying that last book was an issue, add a hard cover and a ton more pages  and you've better start working out before carrying this around.<br />3. More  usage of UNICODE and &quot;NT&quot; style information that is repeated in  each code segment so be prepared.<br />It's a revision, and it's good.  It's  the best out there right now, but will not solve every problem you'll  have.<br />Note:  If you like object oriented, and uses of all the enhanced  features of C++ you're not going to find it here.	1999-06-25
US	52649648	R2Y0NY1E6N5K3S	013260969X	797205826	3: Internetworking with TCP/IP Vol. III, Client-Server Programming and Applications--BSD Socket Version (2nd Edition)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Good mix of network theory &amp; actual code	This book had a good introduction to networking, and great explainations on the jargon used in network programming (TCP,Datagrams, OSI Model, etc).  The code snippets where nice, but many of the wrapper functions that they used were shuffled around from chapter to chapter.  This forced me to keep going back 20+ pages to search for some wrapper function that had been created.<br />It could have been better if the code built upon itself a little more.  Although theory on the &quot;do's and do not's on client/server programmer&quot; where very useful!<br />The end of the book got a little too indepth into tunneling and other features of networking which seemed to go beyond the scope of the subject for &quot;Programmers&quot;.	1998-05-21
