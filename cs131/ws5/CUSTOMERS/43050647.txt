Unlike many trades, finding good information on PV use and installation with the right amount of technical detail and handholding in book format is not easy. Few comprehensive guides on the subject exist to begin with and to make matters worse, alot of misinformation has been spread around by those with a stake in the game, leaving the consumer and property owner wondering what to do.<br /><br />The Solar Electric House appears to be designed to rescue one from such a quagmire. What makes The Solar Electric House such a unique title and moreover a valuable addition to the energy independent homeowner's library is the fact that it speaks to all audiences of all levels very well. Novices will enjoy the detailed step by step information and through background on the history of PV, while experienced PV technicians are provided with enough technical information to satisfy even the most demanding of the bunch.<br /><br />The Solar Electric House does not just tell you to do this and don't do that, rather it explains the underlying processes at play while pointing our pros and cons and permits the reader to draw his own conclusions as to what should or should not be done. The Solar Electric House goes far beyond history lessons and does a great deal of discussion on practical concerns the average user is likely to deal with at some point. It is this down to earth approach that makes this book such an enjoyable and informative read.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you are currently living in a home with a PV system, planning to buy a home with one, installing or just looking to expand your horizons and consider a new approach to solving the age-old problem of how to power a home, farm, ranch or business responsibly, reliably and economically, The Solar Electric House  should not be absent from your bookshelf.	2005-08-28

The level of detail presented herein was very helpful in giving the reader a complete picture of whats really involved in putting up, operating and using a wind-based Renewable Energy (RE) system. Very helpful are the many graphs and charts which provide organization and understanding of the numerous technical aspects of the subject.<br /><br />Some of the often overlooked but very important subjects covered in Wind Power are the: tower installation and tower types, location selection, mounting on RVs, wind turbine design, do-it-yourself wind turbines and how to select a prebuilt wind turbine. All of these subjects and many more are covered in great detail, usually with one or more color photographs to support and demonstrate the author's points.<br /><br />Wind Power is full of common sense safety tips for the homeowner and also points out some hazards that might not be so readily apparent to the untrained eye. Also included is loads of good advice from start to finish with regard to locating, selecting, purchasing, installing, operating and servicing your wind turbine.<br /><br />At nearly five hundred pages, Wind Power leaves no stones unturned in its quest to document all aspects of the booming industry of wind-based RE systems. As oil prices continue to soar and citizens continue to search for ways to increase their quality of life (and health of their pocketbook), wind-based RE systems will continue to grow in popularity. Wind Power provides the reader with the opportunity to get ahead of the curve and learn important information not readily available now.	2005-08-24

It also does an excellent job of acquainting readers with the major components of a Wind Renewable Energy (RE) system and the functions thereof. In the opinion of this reviewer, the book does what it is intended to do: provide an overview a wind-based RE system and give the reader a basic understanding of same.<br /><br />However, as other reviewers have noted that Wind Energy Basics is not for the technical mind. The title does lack the step by step, do it yourself instructions that one would need to put his own wind-based RE into operation.<br /><br />Those who are already familiar with wind-based RE systems and are in search of a complete nuts and volts guide will probably take little away from this title. A better choice would probably be the more complete, much larger \\"Wind Power: Renewable Energy for Home, Farm and Business\\", also by Paul Gipe. ISBN 1-931498-14-8. At nearly 500 pages, I have yet to come across a more complete reference on the subject of Wind Power.<br /><br />All in all, Gipe's Wind Energy Basics: A Guide to Small and Micro Wind Systems is a good starting point for the homeowner who is considering the possibility of buying or installing an RE system for the first time. If you are not extremely knowledgeable about RE systems and are in search of a book that will introduce you to the components and technologies, Wind Energy Basics will serve you well.	2005-08-14

Books	5	8	8	N	N	Makes the Case for Getting the FedGov Out of the Minting Biz	This slender volume is but a mere 119 pages, yet it is one of the most important books ever written on the subject of economics, freedom, corruption, politics and greed. One might wonder how such a  tiny publication could cover so many topics in such a through manner. The answer is simple: \\"money\\", as most people know the substance, truly is the root of all evil - especially when the government is allowed to get its hands in the mix.<br /><br />What Has Government Done to Our Money? by Murray N. Rothbard is the book that modern governments surly don't want their citizens to have. First the reader learns exactly what money is and how it came to be in relation to the history of many. Next we explore several different types of money, their pros and cons and several systems of accounting and banking. And finally, the reader proceeds to learn about banks, how they came into existence and the needs they fill in early as well as modern economies.<br /><br />But the author doesn't stop there. This well-written, extremely pointed title lays out the manner in which central banks are used by governments to control the populous and strangle the economy. Then, we explore the roles of the various players in any economy (bankers, mints, creditors, debtors, etc) and how these players leverage their positions. Finally, Rothbard provides historical examples of how governments have pulled off various swindles by manipulating the monetary supply and otherwise defrauding the public.<br /><br />You didn't read this stuff in your high school economics class and you probably never will read it anywhere else. This is one of the most informative books of its size or price that I have ever read. You are definitely getting your money's worth (no pun intended) out of this one.	2005-06-03

But as Al points out, good citizens with open minds welcome the opportunity to read about things they may not entirely agree with to help them make better, more informed decisions about topics that matter to them most. A book can still be a good book even if we dont agree with it entirely. Such is the case with Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.<br /><br />Al's masterpiece is a very engaging, witty title. Its line-by-line analysis of right-wing propaganda is nothing short of stellar. Part propaganda-debunking, part comedy and part activism, Lies is a shining example of literature written without spin. While Sweet n' Low may be a substitute for sugar in your morning coffee, there is no substitute for the truth and Al takes this concept to a whole new level.<br /><br />Especially entertaining was Al's several chapters devoted to exposing Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly's skeletons in the closet. These chapters would probably be even more humorous if the characters they discuss weren't so disgraceful. After reading the diabolical about how O'Reilly lost his cool with Al on a set, I had to remind myself that this is the guy that millions of conservatives worship.<br /><br />While I may not agree with every point Al makes (for instance, Al and I dont share the same view on Social Security), he does make each point very convincingly and puts up a good fight even for the ones that I dont agree with. Anyone can spew rhetoric, but those that actually go back to the source, pull the original news clippings, dig through the Internet and verify a story line by line before publishing it are the ones that deserve admiration.<br /><br />Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right is worth reading even if you aren't a hardcore \\"liberal\\" as that term is used. Even a radical, nutty Libertarian like myself can find things to agree with in this title.<br /><br />If nothing else, at the end of reading this title, you'll be holding in your hand, tangible proof the right is full of lying liars and you'll now know all of the lies they have told., nutty Libertarian like myself can find things to agree with in this title.  <br /> <br />If nothing else, at the end of reading this title, you'll be holding in your hand, tangible proof the right is full of lying liars and you'll now know all of the lies they have told.	2005-04-04

I was hoping to find a riveting tale of judicial misconduct and abuse of government power. Sadly, all I found was the same old propaganda spewed forth by the fans of tort reform, regurgitated with a new level of hostility.<br /><br />Men In Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America is another in a long line of works bashing the judiciary for making controversial decisions. Much like the others before it, it is short on verifiable facts and figures and plentiful with political bias, ideological thinking and socialism.<br /><br />This title is merely Republican Party propaganda disguised as a factual assessment of the situation. This title reeks of yellow journalism. Its value as a literary work is rather small, but its value as award-winning propaganda is quite great. If you are looking for a title that will tell you what the GOP wants you to hear, you've probably found a winner.<br /><br />But if you are after actual evidence of judicial misconduct and abuse of power, Men In Black: How the Supreme Court Is Destroying America should be fairly close to the bottom of your list.	2005-03-27

Oddly enough, the title was shelved in the humor section, which didn't make much sense to me as the book isn't particularly entertaining but takes a rather serious, right-to-the-point approach to the business of using questionable means to further your career.<br /><br />The Spy's Guide: Office Espionage will tech you how to: take an impression of a key for duplication, secure a hotel room, check your conference room for bugs, bug a conference room, reassemble shredded documents, copy documents without leaving a trace as to what copier was used, conceal objects in a bottle of water, sneak into a tradeshow without being noticed, use your cell phone to your advantage, make untraceable phone calls and faxes, keep your private conversations private and much more.<br /><br />As slim as this volume is, it is surprisingly through and complete. For your average working stiff, this will be more than adequate for taking your game to the next level.	2005-03-24

Many Pro Se litigants are not as fortunate as I have been. I have working relationships with several well-respected attorneys who allow me to borrow their templates and make my own from theirs. The attorneys actively practice in the area and are known for writing documents that win cases.<br /><br />Most litigants are forced to resort to grabbing another attorney's brief off the internet and format theirs in a similar manner. But this can be problematic. After all, how do you know that the attorney you grabbed the brief from is doing it correctly? You dont -- until you get into court and the judge and the opposing counsel both give you 'the look' which inaudibly says \\"What the heck is this piece of garbage and why is it in my courtroom?\\".<br /><br />Its often not just about what you say, but rather how you lay it out on paper. Presentation is very often just as important as what you actually say. That's why style guides like The Redbook are so important.	2005-02-12

While the title discusses numerous different parts of your body you can sell, it covers the process of selling some of them better than others.<br /><br />If you are looking to sell a kidney, this title will tell you little more than the fact that it is illegal in the United States, that a kidney is worth about $50,000 and that it can be done legally in other countries. A few examples of where one might start are provided. However, it leaves the reader to determine who would buy, how to market the goods and so on. If you are looking to sell your kidney, this title will probably not be helpful to this end.<br /><br />However, Sell Yourself to Science goes into sufficient detail on how to sell bone marrow, blood plasma, hair, breast milk and other byproducts. Perhaps the most interesting section is the part about how to sell small slices of your liver or spleen for big bucks before you die. You'll still be left with enough to survive and the organ does regenerate itself. This topic is covered briefly. Brief information is included on being a surrogate mom as well.<br /><br />Sell Yourself to Science goes into great detail on how to sell your sperm (for both impregnation and for research only purposes, those selling for research only will face almost no screening [you can even be HIV positive] where as those selling for impregnation will be very carefully screened and face many probing questions about past medical history and more) and even provides an extensive appendix listing places that will buy your baby batter.<br /><br />A substantial portion of Sell Yourself to Science (approximately 60%) is dedicated to the art of selling yourself to Phase One medical research studies. It includes information on working conditions, risks, things you should stay away from, how to learn about the studies going on in your area and using fellow guinea pigs to get inside information on the next study coming up. If you are looking to be shot up with the latest wonder drug for pay or otherwise used (or abused) to further science, this book will be invaluable to you.<br /><br />Author Jim Hogshire spends little time trying to convince the reader that its your body and you have the right to part it out as you will, but does touch briefly on the ethical concerns.

For years, Black's Law Dictionary has been a staple at firms large and small alike, serving as an invaluable reference when one needs a universally accepted and respected definition of a term.<br /><br />Cases are often made (or not made) based not on a cold, dry reading of the law itself but rather the efficiency with which the practitioner conveys his point and makes it stand on its own. A compelling brief is often short but makes extensive use of powerful language to grab the reader's attention and hold it. A well written pleading will have it's reader thinking about the points made therein long after the proceeding has concluded.<br /><br />This is a reference volume you will refer to time and time again, it is well worth the expense and no other product can compare. A mechanic is only as good as his tools, and a legal practitioner is only as good as the research materials he has access to.<br /><br />Black's Law Dictionary is the most concise, most complete collection of legal definitions ever assembled.	2004-12-23

The online registration was quick and painless. Amazon.com does not charge sales tax on orders shipped to Ohio. By purchasing this voucher with free super saver shipping, I ended up shaving just under $20 off the price of the exam. By joining the Amazon.com Associates program and clicking on the link on my website, I received about $4 in 'commission' for the 'sale'.<br /><br />The only way I can see this voucher approach being a problem is if you had to take the test on short notice, but those who plan ahead always stand to save and this is no exception. Buy the voucher with the exam guide and you'll have it in plenty of time.<br /><br />Watch the expiration dates, though. Be sure you can actually get to the testing center to take the exam before the voucher expires as they are not refundable and the expiration date cannot be extended, according to PearsonVUE.<br /><br />Also note that the voucher is good ONLY at PearsonVUE centers, but that is clearly stated in the product description, so the other reviewers complaining that other exam centers wouldn't accept it have a reading and/or comprehension problem, something that will be detrimental to them on the exam in more ways than one.	2004-12-14

I typically dislike narrated tapes because many narrators are overbearing and feel the need to explain every little event, usually resulting in my mumbling of various expletives at the tape player like \\"Shut up and let me decide for myself\\" and \\"I want to hear the justices, not you describing the paintings on the wall\\". May It Please the Court was different however, the narrator spoke no more than necessary and was unusually informative when he did speak.<br /><br />Every citizen who wants to learn how our legal system works should listen to these tapes. I have little doubt that these tapes would prove to be invaluable learning tools in the classrooms in both public high schools and in the collegiate setting.<br /><br />Whether you are a law student, pro se litigant, seasoned attorney or just an average citizen wanting to know more about how the system works, May It Please the Court is well worth the price and your time.	2004-11-21

The lessons are not organized and skip steps, apparently assuming that the reader has the ability to read the author's mind. There doesn't appear to be a logical progression from chapter to chapter, lesson to lesson. Or perhaps they expect you to already know the content, but then this begs the question: What is the point of a study guide? Just go test out.<br /><br />Out of the world's largest software company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars annually, I would have expected a top-notch title complete with though lessons and real-world information. I also would have expected a toll-free number where I could request a refund if I wasn't happy with the purchase. I have yet to locate the quality lessons a handful of reviewers speak of, and no telephone number to speak of - toll free or otherwise.<br /><br />Regardless, this title most definitely should not be considered to be the excellent study aid Microsoft has billed it as.

At the same time, a sense of realism and a sense of normalcy is maintained throughout. At several times the reader is startled by unexpected events to keep him going.<br />But perhaps the most startling event of all is the ending. In nearly all cases... the knowledgeable reader already has a good idea what the ending will be before reading 75% of the title and is rarely shocked by the ending. There are plenty of hairpin turns and sharp corners in this book, none are more abrupt than the ending which leave the reader both satisfied and puzzled.	2004-06-06

This book really was rather disappointing. After reading the back cover and Introduction, the reader is told to expect detailed insight into the details of this near north side Chicago house of horrors and the man who owned it.<br />While The Man Who Killed Boys offers to the reader a reasonably accurate chronicle of the events that were Gacy's twisted reality, it fails to dig deep below the surface to explore what made him tick. Moreover, it fails to probe Gacy's past as it glosses over his childhood years and spends the majority of the pages reciting murder after murder scene.<br />The back cover tells us that The Man Who Killed Boys recreates the drama of Gacy's trial... the book spends less precious few pages talking about the actual trial, while it consumes many a page discussing Gacy's jail conditions and other items related to his confinement.<br />If you want to read a story, this is probably an acceptable choice.

Traffic citations - especially seatbelt citations - are about money. And power. And stripping back the constitution. If it were about safety, they wouldn't put so much focus on citations so much, they would straighten dangerous curves, force property owners to cut back brush that causes blind intersections, install traffic control devices where needed and work harder to get the most dangerous class of drivers - those who drive while intoxicated - off the roads and into jails.<br />Instead, they choose to focus on the issuance of traffic citations.

This one is different. If you have read the others, you know they are written with the attitude that the system cares about innocence and guilt, right and wrong, fair and unfair. All you have to do is tell a good story (true or not) and you'll get off. It doesn't work that way. The system only cares about finding you guilty and getting your money. Other titles skip over very important legal terminology and civil procedure. This one doesn't.<br />This is the only book I have read on the topic that explains what a motion is, how to prepare and file one and when one should be filed.

While all of the arguments he makes are fundamentally correct and he does end up making the point he intended to, some of the things that he cites as fact are based on outdated laws and practices while others are simply incorrect. This reviewer found several of the aforementioned errors to extend beyond a mere typographical error or casual omission.<br />  For instance, the author attempts to make an argument against the popular Caller ID services offered by the vast majority of telephone companies today. He claims that because the service allows the number of the caller to be displayed, it can be misused and abused by business and others with less than honorable intentions. One example would be cross-referencing the number displayed by Caller ID to other databases to learn the customers' address and then using this information to pull up even more information about the customer such and spending habits, consumer profiles and other private information.<br />  For instance, on Page 40 Smith states &quot;Officials at high levels of government and business will not be able to make telephone calls without revealing their direct office numbers... whether they are listed or not&quot;. This is an untrue statement as most business and government offices use commercial telephone systems that are serviced by &quot;trunks&quot; of telephone lines. When those lines are ordered and the system installed, the telephone company provides the customer with option to 1. suppress the transmission of Caller ID information, 2. allow its transmission or 3. transmit another number (like the main switchboard number).<br />  While Smith does make compelling arguments against Caller ID, several United States Postal Service programs that disclose or misuse consumer information, important information is left out. He also does not state that telephone services and the privacy implications of each vary widely from state to state and even from phone company to phone company, leaving the reader with only half of the story. This book is riddled with many such omissions and inconsistencies, most of them in this Caller ID argument.<br />  By contrast, Smith's argument against Social Security Numbers and their use for purposes other than that of collecting Social Security is factually accurate and quite informative even to someone who keeps up on privacy related issues.<br />  Our Vanishing Privacy is by no means a 'bad book' and it should still be read. But it is important to keep in mind that details are missing and much of the information is outdated. However, the reader still does come away with valuable knowledgens of each vary widely from state to state and even from phone company to phone company, leaving the reader with only half of the story.

Casinos are in the business of taking people's money. They are not a charity and they don't have a 30 day money back guarantee. It's a fact and no matter what spin they try to put on it, it's your wallet that they have in their sights. It's operation drain pocketbook. And according to some estimates, as much as 80% of a given casino's revenues now come from slot machines.<br />They are easy to play and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure them out. Even the dumb kids can play them. Unlike table games which can be intimidating because of the interactions with other players and the complexities of the games themselves, you just put a couple of coins in and hit the little button or pull the magic lever. Who can't handle this?<br />It is because of this simplicity that slots generate the largest share of revenue for the gaming industry. In Blackjack, a player has lots of control over how much of an \\"edge\\" the house has. With a slot machine, it does what it is programmed to do and short of taking a sledge hammer to it - there is nothing you can do to change that - until now.<br />Frank begins with an excellent - but short and sweet - history of slot machines as they relate to the industry. He also describes how the machine actually works, which is of great importance to the player. Some of the most basic information he provided about today's \\"smart slots\\" dispels many myths: including the one of hot and cold machines and the infamious \\"it pays better when I don't use my [player's] card\\".<br />Not only is this title a learning experience, it helps the savvy slots player understand the forces at work behind the machines designed to take his money. Understanding how the machines work is half the battle - knowing how the casino works and why it works that way is the other half. And Frank does a remarkable job of quenching the readers' thirst for both.<br />Using Frank's techniques and information obtained from his interview with a casino slot executive who he refers to as \\"Mr. Handle\\", I have been able to locate the \\"loose\\" machines in even the tightest casinos. The information is not only on target, it makes perfect sense when one considers what is being said.<br />Frank's extremely revealing interview - quoted verbatim - has exposed so much about the placement of \\"loose\\" machines. And what's even more valuable is the fact that Frank has not only provided the locations but also the reasoning behind the locations.<br />Finally, the book contains a wealth of information that has been put into perspective about the slot player's long and short term prospects. Can you really come out ahead? According to Frank, yes - but only if you are careful and heed the warnings in this title.<br />For the few dollars you spend on this book, you may save yourself hundreds and maybe much more at the slots.fers to as \\"Mr. Handle\\", I have been able to locate the \\"loose\\" machines in even the tightest casinos.

This was one of several books I purchased on the topic and I have poured over 100s of internet articles on card counting, cheating and other issues related to the game.<br />While I have always known how to play Blackjack informally, I know that only a fool sits down at a table in a Casino and starts placing bets without knowing every nook and cranny of the rules. I knew that the object of the game was to get as close to 21 without going over. I was also aware of splits and other such maneuvers.<br />Mead's book taught me what I needed to know - filled in the blanks. I would have always thought that one should split two face cards and take the chance that one would get an ACE on one hand and another face or high card on the other. But Mead explains why statistically this is a newbie mistake.<br />Loaded with invaluable insider information, Beginner to Pro taught me what I needed to know without confusing me with loads of useless facts, figures, charts, statistics and rhetoric. The title takes a very straight-forward, no-bull approach and wastes no time getting to the point.<br />Putting Mead's advice into action, my first night was very successful and I was quite pleased with the swelling of my bank account as a direct result	2003-02-25

When Tony \\"Casper\\" Murry held a box cutter to Sue's neck one night this February, the fifth grade boy had to think quickly. He ran to an upstairs bedroom to grab a gun and then flew back down the stairs with a .45 in hand. The boy shot one round and hit Murry, 27, in the chest, even though the man was shielding himself with the grandmother.<br />I remember watching this story unfold in my home town. Every day, good hard-working Americans are saved by guns. Ordinary people who intervene to save themselves from those who place a very low value on human life.<br />Lets face it: If gun locks where such a great idea, we'd see officers using them on their beats. \\"If I'm a bad guy, I'm always gonna have a gun. Safety locks? You pull the trigger with a lock on, and I'll pull the trigger. We'll see who wins,\\" Sammy \\"the Bull\\" Gravano (an infamous gangster-turned-informant) says.<br />In Guns Save Lives, we see several true stories (without the drama, without the glorification) about people who are alive today because of guns.

I was wrong.<br />Mitnick's book is full of useful information that can [and should] be put to use in any organization. The advice provided is not only practical but detailed and logical. The stupidity or carelessness of one user on the corporate LAN can render millions of dollars in gee-wiz security gadgets useless, allowing hackers into sensitive severs housing customer contact lists, proprietary trade secrets and internal memorandums containing confidential and personal information.<br />For those of you who don't know, Mitnick breached the security of the largest corporations in America, including Motorola. After one of the most exhaustive manhunts in FBI history, and Mitnick's subsequent release from federal prison, he has been the most sought-after security consultant in the world.<br />Mitnick, who is probably the world's foremost expert in trickery to gain access to sensitive information (known as 'social engineering'), reveals exactly how vulnerable you and your companies' personal information is to someone posing as an IRS Agent or as a AT&T Customer Service Representative. You could say that Mitnick either had god's unlisted telephone number, or he could trick someone into giving it to him.<br />Full of information that any company can use to implement effective security practices and make sure they are followed, The Art of Deception is a book that every corporate security manager,  investigator and hacker alike should have on his or her desk.	2002-10-14

In &quot;Prison Killing Techniques: Blade, Bludgeon and Bomb&quot;, Ralf Dean Omar allows his readers to both prepare themselves with a working knowledge of prison survival, as well as bring insight to the failure at large of The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to make them safe.<br />If you are going to prison for the first time, you will want to read this book. Your survival will depend on your ability to escape and evade your foes, and without the information contained in the page-turner, you might be left behind... or left for dead.<br />As a reader turns pages, a mental image of what a prison must be like begins to develop in the mind of the un-initiated reader. For those who have a need to know, for those who will go to prison and for those interested in making prisons a safe place where rehabilitation can take place, this book should be high on the list of publications to read.	2001-12-01

I have seen several books that attempt to pick apart the advertising campaigns of Corporate America. \\"No Logo\\" is truly one of the best books I have read. As a book that dissects information to the most basic level, Naomi Klein does it like no other has done before.<br />If you don't believe everything you see on television, hear on the radio or printed in the newspapers, then this book will fit in perfectly with your mindset. As corporations turn the public into mindless buying machines, this book fights to expose all that is wrong with advertising today.<br />Being a business owner myself, I found the book to be a great handbook on ethical advertising techniques. While advertising in and of itself is a necessary evil, there are proper ways to do it. Naomi Klein has done a magician's job in displaying the do's and dont's of advertising.<br />America needs a wakeup call, and has needed one for some time. \\"No Logo\\" delivers just that, a firm, swift kick in the buttocks, and boy does Klein pack a killer punch.<br />I found this book to be an exhilarating read from cover to cover. If you would like a glimpse of what really goes in the boardrooms of Corporate America, this book should not only be on your 'to-read' list, it should be at the top...	2001-10-18

What can I say? Ragnor Benson delivers heart-stoping information again. Inside of a book with a plain cover, Ragnor proves that age-old theroy that you just cannot judge a book by it's cover.<br />Based upon the experinces of Washinton insiders, Benson debates that ever-controversial topic of warfare stratagy. As Benson puts the skin on the bones with information that can be found nowhere else, the reader is catapulted into a sea of informative, yet entertaining and thought-provoking.<br />In one word: Excellence!	2001-07-30

FakeID by Modem &amp; Mail is a book that is always a recommended read for my customers. The book is the perfect compliment to your already-exisiting library of similar titles for the hard times.<br />Jam packed with good, honest and useful information, the book is short, quick and to the point. However, the book is somewhat of an overview, and does not go as deeply as it could on some topics. That is the *only* reason this book is not deserving of a five, becuase it is somewhat shallow in its approach. None the less, the book is recommended reading, and most are sure to walk away knowing something more than they did before the picked up the title.	2001-07-26
US	43050647	R2174442GKQDCR	0615115144	654075771	How to Change Your Identity & Erase Bad Credit	Books	5	20	25	N	N	How to Change Your Identity &amp; Erase Bad Credit	Written and self-published by James Doolin, a three-time federal ex-con who was imprisoned for providing new identities to more than 1,100 illegal immigrants over 3 years, this is the book that not a single publisher would touch!<br />Section One details the many different ways to exploit the United States Identity System, and how to create false birth certificates, which are the foundation (and also the weakest layer) of the system. Sample documents, methods, instructions and practical advice is abundant throughout the publication, with Mr. Doolin drawing on his numerous experiences as he tells it all.<br />Section Two provides all the information you need to strike negative information from your credit record, including charge-offs, leases, loans, mortgages and just about anything else you can get stuck with on your credit record. Using the tried and true methods described in excruciating detail, and a little bit of effort, you can have an A-1 credit record within just a few months.<br />Co-authored by Denise Scott (an alias), an employee of the  major credit bureaus for over 10 years, the insider information available within is almost unbelievable. While the book is plain and bland in appearance, the information contained inside is more explosive than fireworks on the fourth of July. As both authors speak from experience, the information that only the insiders know spews forth in indispensable detail. We have seen alot of &quot;Fake ID&quot; and &quot;Credit Repair&quot; books in our day, but this one takes the cake!	2001-07-19
