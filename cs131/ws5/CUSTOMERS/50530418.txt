I knew Kerry was a goner as soon as I saw him in the first debate with Bush Jr., even though the vast majority of people thought he won it handily.  Kerry addresses the American people as if he was defending his thesis in front of a Harvard committee---full of technocratic step-by-step plans, promises of a/b/c if d/e/f is done, constantly making numbered lists and multi-part responses to even the most simple questions....absolute DISASTER with an electorate that has become so hopelessly dumbed-down, hysterical and simple-minded as ours.<br /><br />This book diagnoses the problem beautifully---namely that as earnest and wonkish Democrats keep trying to appeal to the BRAIN of Americans, the Republicans cleverly, systematically and ruthlessly exploit FEAR and ANGER of the electorate.  All too often, Democrats assume that everyone else has the same logical and rational thought process they have, instead of sussing out and appealing to the gut fears and emotions of the electorate.  Republicans keep their sights set squarely on Main Street---talking the talk so well and so loudly that Main Street never notices how they never walk the walk.	2005-07-14

Ron Hubbard's \\"Dianetics,\\" for example.  L<br /><br />This book at least has beautiful pictures, well-written prose, and is a pleasantly quick read.<br /><br />Moreover, this theory can only be beneficial, whether it's ever proven conclusively or not: that the universe is composed mostly of water, and that water is very much a porous and dynamic substance that is very intimately affected by its environment.  The inevitable corollary there is that a positive, gentle, and mindful approach to life is good not only for the subject but for all objects around the subject, because subject and object are ultimately one organic unity.  This is the foundation of much Eastern philosophy, and also of the more mature segments of Western thought---rather than the myopic, puerile and destructive Cartesian \\"rationalism\\" and \\"empiricism\\" on display in most of the negative Amazon reviews of this book.	2005-05-25

I loved the analysis of the film \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and also the profile of Robert Bly was very revealing if all true.<br /><br />Would also recommend her more recent book, \\"Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man\\" where she absolutely nails it: the chief oppressor of men is not women but other men, namely the ruthless and amoral men who currently run our corporations and by extension our government as well as popular mass culture and media.<br /><br />The long and short of it: It's not racism or sexism, reverse or otherwise, that's destroying this great country but plutocratic and oligarchic CORPORATISM which has exploded and entrenched itself exponentially during the Bush Jr. regime.<br /><br />Yes, that's an ECONOMIC CLASS analysis, precisely the one taboo subject in our allegedly \\"free\\" media and national discourse these days.  Anyone who tries to bring up that subject nowadays is inevitably (in an knee-jerk, Pavlovian manner) smeared as a pointy-headed Stalinist, but there's the ugly truth.<br /><br />Our nation desperately needs many more Susan Faludis to do the investigative and analytical work that our corporate media sold out on a long time ago.	2005-05-11

Yep, eating more meals but smaller and smarter meals each day does make a big difference.  This is hardly a new or revolutionary concept, heck I remember hearing this advice way back in the early 80s when I was doing high school athletics.<br /><br />Cruise however needs to sell books so he packages this simple truth with huge helpings of mass-appealing hype and pop psychology horse droppings, such as saying that you don't need to exercise if you're on this plan.  That's just an obvious craven marketing appeal to all the lazy TV-addicted flubberbutts this book is aimed at.<br /><br />The hard truth is, dieting without exercise can work, but it takes about ten times longer and will be nowhere as holistically beneficial.  Starting an exercise program on top of adopting these dietary changes will not only enable you to shed pounds much faster but will also provide cardiovascular health, greatly enhance your emotional/mental well-being, strengthen your immune system, make you more resistant to depression---the list goes on and on.  Come on people, get real!<br /><br />Gimmicky is as gimmicky does, I guess.

I was stuck at my wife's hair salon waiting for her to finish and it was either this or a dozen Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping magazines.<br /><br />First off I must say that I was a bit biased...I normally never watch TV anymore and get all my news online since both TV and TV news in the past 15 years have gone straight down the toilet called Idiot Culture of Celebrity and Tabloid Pseudo-Journalism.

The Republicans understand this very well and have exploited it ruthlessly and brilliantly to devastating effect ever since the time of Reagan.  Democrats have to get their heads out of the sand and start cultivating, rather than alienating, these grassroots voters...Clinton and Carter, the last two Democrats to get into the White House since JFK, did so in large part by directly appealing to that part of the electorate.<br /><br />This is not pandering or selling out---it is democracy in action: rule of the people just as they are, for better and worse, not rule of an insular elite that just talks to itself in a couple of major metropolitan centers on the east and west coast.<br /><br />Jim Wallis does an excellent job of analyzing those cultural and demographic realities, and showing how much the left needs to wake up, smell the coffee, and fight to reclaim the rightful place of religion in our national discourse.	2005-01-25

This book doesn't really say anything that's not painfully obvious to anyone who's spent anytime in Europe and compared it to middle America, but it might be very instructive to those who have not had that opportunity.<br /><br />The first thing you notice in Europe is just how few fat people there are.  Sure there are some stout/chunky people especially those over 40 but the kind of massive jiggling blobs (think Michael Moore) that are so common here, is extremely rare.  Now, some ignorant yee-haws might like to say that's because they can't afford as much food as we have here, and there might be a LITTLE economic truth in that, but not much.<br /><br />The main reason is that in general Europeans live much closer to nature not necessarily in the sense that they dance in meadows all the time, but more in the sense that their daily lives are  not as artificial and technologically-dependent as ours.<br /><br />For instance, they walk everywhere because they don't have the kind of urban sprawl we have and they have excellent and comprehensive mass transit, as well as environmentally friendly policies such as taxing the dickens out of gasoline to encourage people not to be so car-dependent as we are.  (We don't have those things because our corporations would never allow the politicians which they own to do it.)  On the whole they don't spend so much time vegetating in front of the TV or the PC so they do get out and get lots more exercise than we do.<br /><br />They also eat better food because their governments are not prostitutes to the agribusiness and processed-food corporations, so they have much tighter regulations which result in most of their meat and produce being organic and pesticide/hormone free.<br /><br />And lastly, whereas Europeans have a CULTURE which values *quality* rather than quantity when it comes to eating.  In contrast, we Americans basically have an ECONOMY more than a true culture...meaning that the economic interests of the corporate elites who truly pull the strings in America are what mainly shape American \\"culture\\" through its ownership and manipulation of the mass media, particularly television.  From childhood on we are bombarded and brainwashed by advertising for nutritionally catastrophic junk foods which we grow up to be addicted to, and are encouraged to eat in massive quantities.  As long as these dirt-cheap-to-mass-produce, hugely-profitable-sell junk foods continue to rake in gazillions of dollars for those corporations, we'll always have them.<br /><br />The result?  Gobble gobble gobble, shop shop shop, spend spend spend, work work work, worry worry worry, want want want---that is the true engine of our world-dominating economy!<br /><br />God bless capitalism, and God bless America.<br /><br />PS. As for the aesthetics of French women debated here, there are prettier women in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, but bottomline is, French women do tend to be thinner and dress more stylishly, than American women on the whole.  Also they don't feel the need to load themselves with ten pounds of makeup, silicone implants, and hair chemicals.

Of all the gutter-conservative pundits out there (as distinct from the REAL and intellectually respectable conservative pundits like William Buckley, George Will, and William Safire), Coulter has always been at the very bottom of that ignominous heap, right alongside the likes of Michael Savage, painkiller-addicted Rush Limbaugh, and vibrator-smitten Bill O'Reilly.  The difference between them and Coulter is that whereas they all sound like dumb blondes, Coulter actually IS one---very useful marketing tool as always.  Isn't that why there's always a full-length picture of her on the covers of her books?<br /><br />As one might expect from a dumb blonde, this book is more or less based on a 5-year old's cartoonish view of the world.  It's \\"us\\" (the reader is assumed to be also all for Mom and apple pie and waving the flag at the drop of a hat) against the laughable caricature of a Liberal with a capital \\"L\\" who is by turns mentally impaired, downright evil, in their early 20s and still sponging off of Mom and Dad.  Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy are just around the corner, coming back from the Republican convention.<br /><br />From beginning to end, there is no letup in this long tiresome whine.  Coulter obviously sees the world as a series of stereotypes, and here pretends to teach the reader how to not only do the same, but also to SPEAK *in* stereotypes *to* living breathing stereotypes.  And only IF we deign to, of course---as the title suggests, in Coulter's warped mind political monologue is always preferable to genuine dialogue.<br /><br />Reading this book would be far less excruciating if Coulter actually got a decent editor (all of her sentences seem to be contain at least half a dozen comically exaggerated and vitriolic adjectives, metaphors, or other useless blather) and tried to be less drearily predictable.<br /><br />If you want to read intelligent conservative writing, I'd recommend looking at Buckley, Safire, Will, hell even Pat Buchanan at least puts together sentences better than this.

Whereas Krugman makes a point of meticulous research and august professionalism in both his tone and content, Dowd specializes in what is basically pop political commentary in the McNews era.  Where Krugman uses statistics and verifiable facts, Dowd more often relies on improvised metaphors, puns, and quasi-hip pop-culture references.<br /><br />The result is that Dowd's work is easier to fly through, whereas Krugman's takes a little more effort but is ultimately more rewarding.  In her constant attempts at light-hearted and jaded humor, Dowd sometimes comes off as rather flaky...but where she doesn't hit the bullseye, she usually comes pretty close in the vicinity and that is her main credit.<br /><br />In \\"Bushworld,\\" she zeroes in on what most Americans already know or increasingly suspect: that Bush Jr. is a hopelessly provincial, empty-headed and simplistic straw man who likes to pose as the Marlboro Man while being manipulated by Machiavellian advisors like Karl Rove and the whole pathologically deluded entourage who got us into this Iraq quagmire, now known as the \\"neocons\\" as well as the extreme religous right who in exchange for electoral support now get to write 90% of Bush's social policy positions.<br /><br />It's a sad, mad, and dangerous situation which in some ways perfectly suits the often desperate attempts at humor and hip detachment to which Dowd, as a powerless spectator like most of us, resorts.<br /><br />For readers who would prefer a snappier, crackle-and-pop style of writing about this hijacked, half-elected White House, Dowd's book is a fine messenger.	2004-09-20

What's more interesting is how he goes through them, just like he goes from one bottle of alcohol to the next, from one from one to another, every time with the same sense of openness, zest and enjoyment from moment to moment.  This book is no manual on Relationships, and as long as you approach it in the same way that Bukowski approached his life---head-on, up-front, no illusions or expectations or preconceptions or preconditions---you may well enjoy the ride just as much as he did!	2003-04-03

I approached this book with a skeptical eye after reading a few samples of its prose, as I am usually very skeptical of overly trendy things.<br />Well, after taking it with me to New Orleans was pleasantly surprised to find that most of it is simply dead-on, and the layout/organization of the book as well as the straight-to-the-point writing made it the best travel book I've ever used!<br />My only complaint is that the low-end section of hotels and restaurants could be expanded a bit more, just for those of us who DON'T have oodles of dough to toss around.  Otherwise I would've given it 5 stars, easy.	2003-03-15

Hilarious, penetrating, and brilliant.  If you're thinking of going to move to the Czech Republic, this is like the BIBLE!  Even if you aren't, it's a great read, well worth it.	2003-02-25

I majored in English Lit at Princeton.  A couple of years later, I stumbled across Bukowski in a little expat bookstore in Prague and couldn't stop reading him.  It galls me to think that I was never ONCE exposed to his work during my four years at Princeton, supposedly one of the \\"cream of the crop\\" American universities!  What in the hell is up with THAT???<br /><br />This man is brilliant, simply brilliant.  Zero pretension and zero tediousness.  Truth flows effortlessly from his pen: simple, raw, real, horrible, hilarious, and beautiful all at the same time.  Yes he does miss almost as often as he hits home, and he could've used a more rigorous editor especially for his notoriously uneven poetry.  However, if you consider that in baseball, a good hitter gets on base at least 30% of the time, Buke definitely is no slouch...I'd guesstimate him to be around a .400 and caution you that sometimes when he swings and misses he can go down really really ugly (\\"The Fiend\\" is an undeniably repulsive fantasy-story about child rape) but when he connects he can blow that sucker out of the park (the first story with the book's title, or \\"The Copulating Mermaid\\" or \\"Six Inches\\").<br /><br />But maybe too politically incorrect for the ivory tower...	2003-02-21

This is the foundation, from which self-knowledge and thereafter self-guidance can grow.<br />It's not a quick or easy process, so those of you with your TV-lobotomized 15-second attention spans who are looking for a quick fix in career planning should probably look elsewhere.<br />This book excels mainly in helping you figure out how to *have a life,* rather than how-to-make-as-many-bucks-as-possible-in-today's-corporate-jungles-without-turning-yourself-into-a-hopelessly-miserable-wreck-of-a-human-being, which is unfortunately what most people hope for when they turn to a \\"career guidance\\" resource.  Which is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.	2002-12-10

The best and most valuable thing this book provides, like much of McYoung's writing, is insight into the psychology of people who provoke and/or engage in streetfights.  In this respect, his books fill a unique niche.  His actual self-defense instruction is sketchy, with very few clear illustrations.<br />The downside: you do have to plow through the author's testosterone-induced rambling and often blustering prose, which is usually entertaining but at times a little tiring.<br />Still not as good as Geoff Thompson's books on street survival, though.	2002-12-01

Closed fist punches to the head and chambered side kicks do not belong in a book that's supposedly geared for the general untrained public that just wants some basic basic self-defense ability.  I would've expected open-palm strikes, elbows and knees, perhaps some basic sweeps and low leg kicks instead.<br />My advice is, read this book for its psychological training, and get your hand-to-hand training from a self-defense or reality-based martial arts school.  (Meaning: avoid Tae Kwon Do and most schools of karate.  Wing Tsun, Muay Thai, Penjak silat, Brazilian jujitsu, or any form of Mixed Martial Arts would be more useful.)	2002-12-01

I was given this book to read by a Raw Foodist friend of mine, and began it with a huge truckload of salt poised behind me.  From the cover, the premise, and the author's pseudonym, I expected some flaky, ivory-tower bore.  Instead I found it to be at turns hilarious, thought-provoking, rivetingly surreal (see the passage where the author recounts killing a chicken with his bare hands and immediately eating the still pulsing meat), and consistently well-written, a delight to read.  And persuasive...I almost considered becoming an Instincto myself!<br />All in all it's definitely worth the exposure to a lifestyle and philosophy you would otherwise never come across anywhere else.  Fascinating to consider, much harder to actually turn your own life upside down and practice it.<br />I give it 4 stars only because the author doesn't spend as much time as he should addressing the concrete logistical barriers that most readers would find in adopting such a diet---Zephyr lives in what sounds like an Edenic commune of like-minded instinctos in Hawaii, and it shows at times.	2002-10-12
