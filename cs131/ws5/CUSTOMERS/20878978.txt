I was definitely surprised that DS lived quite a bit of tragedy and pain herself, perhaps part of her creativity in dealing with human interaction came from  her own insight gained from experience. I loved this book, most out of all of Ms Steel's prolific writings, because this was no artistic contrivance born of a writer's boredom, this was a very painful part of her life and her heart. His Bright Light gives the reader a view into mental illness, not only from its origins, but through the perspective of a familily as it struggles with this destructive illness. The story is not only heart rending but informative and interesting to read. Danielle Steel appears to be a very private person, this autobiographical account written in tribute to her son, will probably be the only in depth peek we may get into the life of the great Danielle Steel. I also suggest this as a therapeutic gift for any family suffering due to having a mentally ill loved one.	2005-04-02

Not only is this an interesting and mentally challenging book, it presents this great loss that we all suffered in the perspective of a determined and resilient child--this child could almost be symbolic of us all as a nation, as we each found ways and continue to find ways to cope with our great losses and our lessor ones... The writing syle, is what is most appealing about this book--it is brilliant, sarcastic, silly, thought provoking and at times, funny.	2005-04-02

The writing style of Helen Bonner is insightful, yet slightly detached as she tells of recovered memories surfacing as she taught literature as a college professor. Bonner veils her painful recollections within  the stories of literature and her world as a professor, becoming angered at the mores of the past and present social structure that can allow a woman's worth to go unnoticed...then as the story unfolds like a mystery, Bonner addresses the real dragons in her life, the painful truth about her incestuous past and her recovery. The tone of the book is intellectual, mentally stimulating and emotionally engaging.<br /><br />This is a profound book, for both victims and anyone who appreciates good literature.	2005-03-31

The powerful drives within Obama moves him to search out his roots (reminds me of the quest of Alex Haley, author of Roots)seeking to find himself through his past.

There are always root causes to depression (even if physiological) that the field of psychology has not dealt with as a whole until recently. This book deals with cognitive thought processes and patterns associated with people who have been depressed for extended periods of time , as well as the emotional and social aspects of depression.<br /><br />  Most people who suffer from depression that I have personally come in contact with, are resigned to be dependant upon medications and have lost faith in therapy. This book simplifies depression so that it makes 'sense' to laymen and it is useful for therapists as well. It also gives hope to depression sufferers.	2004-11-19

I like the simplicity of the book, although it does not deal indepth with treatment, it clearly identifies behavior. Some BPD's are relieved to find thier behaviors have a common name and some are discouraged by it...but most people who deal with the behavior of a loved one with BPD, who have spent years riding the roller coaster of emotions BPD's inflict upon you--are relieved to find they did not imagine things. BPD's make you feel as if YOU are the problem, simply because they have learned from their environments as children, that it was \\"safer for them to manipulate and 'control' the adults around them , than to trust them to 'do the driving' so to speak\\" (my quote of BPD)...<br /><br />GOOD book, but I would not give as a present to a BPD sufferer, they are indivuals, some are ready to heal and some are not..they book would only anger them.	2004-11-19

I read In Cold Blood more than once over the years, there is a depth and richness added to the telling of a horrible crime story, that goes well beyond reciting cold facts. Capote lends a special psychological insight to the reader, as one reads about not just the crime, the act, but the people that were involved. Capote makes it possible to reconstruct the lives of the dead innocents simply from the life residue they left behind and he allows us to venture safely into the dangerous animalistic minds of the killers. In Cold Blood impacts you not only intellectually, but emotionally---and that is what the great craft of writing is all about.	2004-11-15

Through the simple, innocent eyes of children, we see triumph of good over evil played out in a small town. Scout's father, Atticus, told her it is a sin to kill a mockingbird, for they only make music and harm no one. Two innocents, played a role in demonstating this fact: a black man, falsely accused and a mentally ill man by the name of Boo Radley, who does an amazing thing as the subplots unfold, within the major plot. There are several humanistic morals to this story, as Atticus Finch sets an example as a good father and defender of the innocents. To Kill a Mockingbird is not only fascinating reading for all ages, but holds moral lessons that never die for humanity, for all time.	2004-11-01

The author did not bother to buffer this raw reality. I have worked with many children who acted out in the ways portrayed in this book. The ugly act of abuse tends to get externalized by the child (the masterbating that turns some readers off). As for the family atmosphere Bone was raised in--it was ambivalent, just as is the case quite often in real life: a strong bonded family who fails to protect. The book stirs many feelings of conflict within the reader. This book is an education for those who have not got close enough to touch the horror of abuse.	2004-10-31

I have two copies now (people have a habit of borrowing it) and have reread the book more than once.<br /><br />The reviews, although old, are well worded and convey the crux and atmosphere of Angela's Ashes very effectively; I wanted to update the fact that all that is said in the reviews is still true today. The most striking thing about reading Angela's ashes is the in the moment and present voice of the author as he revisited his childhood with the childlike eyes, and feelings of a powerless and vulnerable child whose dysfunctional parents controlled his world. And what a tragic world they were all thrust into when the small impoverished family were back in Ireland living in the dark and dank slums during the rainy season. The only thing that rivaled the dark environment was the family dysfunction and abject killer-poverty.<br />The beauty of Angela's Ashes is that the  power of the human spirit comes through, despite the odds.	2004-10-31

This book is a social drama filled with moral conflict that tests societal attitudes and the barriers society establishes between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The American dream, so easily attained by some, will never be achieved by most, and the rules lived by are sometimes broken for reasons society does not accept (evident in the ending).<br /><br />The plot is very simple, two unlikely misfits become friends, George who dreams of a place to call his own and Lennie, a powerful simple minded giant, subject to delusions. Lennie is like a child and George assumes responsibility for him as they travel doing migrant work. In the course of their travels, they meet representative members of society, those accepted and those not and although Lennie and George try to mind their own business, Lennie commits a terrible 'crime' and George must 'help' his child like friend the only way he knows how.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the details, but the story ends in a moral dilema. Powerful book for literary discussions, social lessons as well as moral discussion---and wonderful to read.	2004-10-28

It is such a healing to laugh about pain, while feeling for the person simultaneously---Burrroughs elicits that response, continually. He has the gift of 'healing' via his writing.

Invisible Man is cleary a classic. When I first read it, I was engrossed by the depth of psychological insight built into the writing style. It was as if the writer, through his 'narrator', delved into his own deepest hurts and fears, caused by an unjust society and a socially naive protagonist. The 'invisible' man only wanted justice and acceptance in a world that would not accept him and in his quest, he almost lost himself in his internal wonderings. Fyodor Doestoevsky wrote Crime and Punishment as if the whole plot took place inside the head of his agonized protagonist--there is a powerful resemblance between Ellison's and Doestoevsky's style. It takes a master author to narrate subjective thoughts into art, Ellison was indeed one of the great writers of our day.	2004-10-26

I was raised, less than 75 miles from where Maya Angelou was born, so I recognize 'mother-wit' when I hear it. I Know Why the Caged Bird sings, is filled with the deep philosophical phrases and ideas common to wise old women of the south. Hardship, sharpens one's view, produces an economy of words that cut straight to the truth of a matter as does Caged Bird, in its flowing prose wrapped in 'mother-wit'.<br /><br />The tragedy of child neglect, racism and child rape are presented in Caged Bird against the strengh of Maya's family upbringing by her proud Grandmother. You can feel that family strength rise up and save Maya, when she became mute after the mysterious 'sudden death' of her rapist. Maya felt the words of her own mouth killed a man, so she resolved to never speak again. Within this powerful decision of a small child, the beginnings of a great poet developed, as she wrote words on a  tablet that she carried with her, instead of speaking. As our Maya turned in to herself for comfort, something was triggered within her, an awareness and insight into the beauty of words.<br /><br /> Reading Caged Bird gives you more than a story, it gives you insight into the birth of one of the greatest poets of our time: Maya Angelou.	2004-10-24

The crime itself was perpetrated by white men, upon a little black girl living in a racist town. Although racism is a powerful force in the plot, the most compelling conflict enacted in this human drama, is that of the heartwrenching dilema the father of this child finds himself in when the court system fails him and his wounded family. It becomes 'A Time to Kill'.<br /><br />  Although this was one of Grisholm's earlier books, I feel it is his best, simply because of the rawness of human emotion revealed in his writing. A Time to Kill is human drama at its finest.	2004-10-24

The book is an excellent awareness tool, for subtle abuse and for those conditioned to it. Of course the book is not perfect, telling an abuser to stop it, usually doesn't work.

Reading this book is like a personal interview with someone who not only lived 'child abuse' but had the insight to understand the dynamics of the perpetrators as well.<br /><br />  Although this book is not literary, it is written well: emotionally powerful, educational and entertaining (definitely holds your interest) to read.<br /><br />  I have read a lot in the field of child abuse, first hand accounts, clinical studies, etc., and this is one of the best books on the subject besides a Child Called It .<br /><br />  Commendation is due for the narrator's voice and tone: not a poor me tone, but a factual, 'I have suvived' tone, actually laced with an underlying sarcastic humor (I actually cracked up in places, because the humor reveals the ridiculousness of adults bullying a small child). This book can be therapeutic to those who are in the proper healing stages of recovery.	2004-10-17

I remember when this book first came out, we even attended an 'upscale violence' training as a result of this book, some were scoffing at the idea of upscale violence. The abusive behaviors and victim coping strategies are almost identical across all socioeconomic spectors, however there are two things that stand out in my experience that make this book a needed tool: the power difference. All abusers wield power over victims: Physical force, emotional blackmail, threats, finances and resources..etc...but the amount of power held by the abuser and the lack of power held by the victim are both crucial elements to consider. In a poor household, if the woman flees in the middle of the night with nothing but the clothes on her back, it is extremely difficult for her because she has nothing, no resources. Society has falsely assumed that rich women should be able to leave easily because they have so much 'power', so many resources.....not necessarily so when the abuser is both powerful and ruthless...he can find you anyplace you go, he can hire attorneys and fight endlessly to take your children away, to discredit you, and he can destroy your career if you have one......so the assumption that a rich woman can easily end her abuse and just walk away is not accurate. Some rich and powerful abusers, resort to murder too.  The poor woman is limited by her lack of power, so is the rich woman, but in a different way. I appreciate the fact that the book deals with the social stigma associated with the affluent revealing that 'all is not well' in their houses, in fact, it may be quite savage and barbaric within their home. One of the worst DV(domestic violence) murders was recorded via a photo (media): a very rich and powerful, well respected doctor killed his wife by burning her alive in the living room of their mansion. And we all remember the O.J. Simpson case. Upscale violence is alive and well, scaring generations of children who appear to 'have it all'....all except a safe home.ing room of their mansion.

Simply put, don't ACT like you don't care, when you do (all men are not ego maniacs in needly little boy clothing), some are honest and secure and expect honest secure behavior in return. This book is perfect for selfish, ego maniacs who do not appreciate being lavished with attention. I will lavish with attention if I feel like it, but only because that is what I choose to do....not to manipulate a man...if he doesn't appreciate me, I will dump him in a minute....honestly.... but ACTING like I don't care, when I really do....nope.  The advice on laying yourself out like a doormat is right on target...that should never happen anyway. No man or woman should sacrifice his or her dignity to buy a crumb of attention.<br /><br />I read many of the posts and I think the reason for the disparity in opinions is that 'one size does not fit all'...for example, one very famous woman was dating a man (she is Still with him...name starts with an O) and she tried playing not interested when she really was....he told her 'look, I sent you roses and I asked you out twice, I won't do it again...do you want to go out with me or not'??....keep it honest.	2004-09-29

The characters are mellow, gracious and strong in a quiet way; for example, when Wang Lung and his family are faced with starvation, men from town come to take advantage of him by offering to buy his land for nearly nothing. Wang Lung angrily refuses and with the quiet support of his wife O-lan, they become determined to not only survive, but to survive from the sweat of their brow and the produce of the good earth.<br />  The Good Earth is filled with conflict, struggle and quiet resolve. You can feel the culture in the characters as well.<br />Pearl Buck won the Nobel prize in 1938, of course the prize is for a 'body' of work--there is no doubt the Good Earth is the strongest work in her collection.<br />This is a great book for all readers	2004-09-17

Good Writing (KIng of course), 3.There are several conflicts going on within the story, societal, mother-daughter, internal conflict within Delores and a moral conflict for the reader; and the third reason this is a good choice for a domestic violence read is 4. the dynamics are there, a layer beneath the surface at times.	2004-08-28

The story is told by fish from a child's perspective, therefore many of the details become almost humorous as we picture the behavior of adults as they hypocritically abuse Fish and his brother while professing a transparent reverence to God. The sprit of Finding Fish is similar to a Tree Grows in Brooklyn: the protagonists were both resilient children, who survived abuse.	2004-08-26

Great books and authors are much like children, each one is both different and special, with different flaws and strenghs. To truly appreciate the unique beauty of Gatsby, you have to look in the right place.<br /><br />  The tone of Gatsby is that of a man who is filled with a longing for a woman and a dream that he is driven to pursue. Gatsby is torn by his knowlege of the transparency of his illusive dream and his his obsessive need to conquer it.<br /><br /> I do not admire chasing illusive dreams,I admire the courage to dream and the incredible drive it takes to chase the dream -- the power of his spirit and the courage that he shows when he holds nothing back in his quest, risking everything. It takes a brave hearted man to soar to remarkable heights only to crash to the ground, when the common man hugs the ground instead. We admire them when they soar and we admire them when they fall and manage to get up again.<br /><br />Great story, great writing, great book.	2004-08-25

I think this is a good definition of what intense and prolonged trauma can do to a human. Even the best of us can snap in a situation like that. Lenore Walker used the idea of learned helplessness and the battered woman syndrome to explain such behavior and Francine, unfortunately, demonstrated it. I can praise the spirit of survival of Francine, but we must continue to work hard to elimate the climate that would entrap victims into seeking their own solutions because the system did not provide them. Francine did the only thing she could rationally believe would work at that time. I hope and I do feel today, we all have more options.<br /><br />  The book should be used as a continous tool as a warning of what extreme relentless trauma can do to a rational person.<br /><br />  Torn From the Inside Out is a memoir that is similar in many ways.	2004-08-12

We know now that children like Francie Nolan would be called resilient children, because they bounce back like the fabled tree growing thrugh the harsh concrete jungles of the brooklyn 'ghetto'. Unfortunately, we have way too many children who can survive such hardship with a resilient spirit.<br /><br />  It isn't merely the storyline that is engrossing, it is the tone and voice, the narrative nuances captured by the writer, Betty Smith, that allow you to see with your mind, but identify with Francie and her plight with your heart.<br /><br />  Even more inspiring is the triumphant spirit of this little girl under duress. It makes one proud to be human. I work in domestic violence field and I have given this gift as an inspiration to particularly challenged children and even ten and twelve year olds can appreciate A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, it becomes emotional meat for their bones and soul.	2004-08-05

I have noticed Clinton and his book both hold true to that concept. Some people try to please everyone, so they are well liked, some don't do much--so they hardly evoke any emotion from anyone---but a person who stirs controversy, is not afraid to tread on feet if need be, will get a lot more good accomplished in the long run---although he will be loved by half and hated by half. I read most of the book (only a bit left to finish) and it is great!! Of course I think the Clintons were too.<br /><br />  The book itself does not appear to be designed to appeal to literary fans so much as historical fans, patriots and those curious enought to want to know the inner makings of one of the most controversial presidents of our day. The story flows well, details of both history, and historical personages are there. I loved What Nelson Mandella said when asked how he felt about 27 years of his life being taken from him when he was imprisoned. I loved the details of the Inaguaral ball,the college years, meeting Hilary and the birth of Chelsea. Oh yes, the Lewinsky/Star account was addressed, even the admission of why he said what he did and lied to the world. Okay, so Clinton was not perfect, most people aren't.<br /><br />  I have found most 1000 page political memoir types boring, but this was really good.	2004-07-22

I found it in his Four Season's book after having seen the movie, and I was flabbergasted at the literary style and psychological insight of Shawshank. I told everyone: 'this one will be a classic' a hundred years from now. I still believe that to be true. I have read almost all of the classics of many countries, so I think I know the feel of one when I read it.<br />  I salute you Stephen King! ........and just think...King was rejected so many times as a new author that he almost gave up, we almost got cheated out of pure genius by the over-cautionary gatekeepers of the literary markets.	2004-07-17

There is of course, a lot of abuse perpetrated by mothers on children and women upon partners. Abuse is abuse, no matter what the gender, and all abuse harms children.<br />  Lundy Bancroft deals primarily with the behaviors, patterns and impact of abuse. When anyone becomes a hardened habitual abuser who uses his or her power to intimidate, manipulate or terrify his or her victims into submission and control: he OR she is considered an 'abuser'. When they phsically hit, break bones and kill, he OR she is a 'batterer'. I work with a domestic violence agency and we have quite a few court ordered women in our program, albeit not as many as men (90%  or more of the MOST serious battering is done by men the country over). I have read much of Bancroft's work and he is on target.	2004-07-16

I have read King's work for years, but I must say, the Shawshank Redemtion proves that King can pull together his creative writing talents into pure literary art.<br />  The Psychological insight into the character's minds actually comes through and the style itself borders on artistic emotional prose at times. This book is full of rich plot, twists, tragedy and trauma and most importantly, the powerful spirit of the innocent victim, explodes in triumph. This story of King is well crafted. I always knew Stephen King was a great author, but until Shawshank Redemption, I didn't know he was a great one. My reading appetite is broad, but I favor the classis such as Crime and Punishment, Grapes of Wrath, To Kill a Mockingbird......Shawshank Redemtion. I salute you Stephen King.  And just think---the agents and big book publishers all rejected King at first! What a genius of a mind we almost missed.	2004-07-16

If you are looking for action, there are tragedies and dramatic events but the focus is not action oriented but the insightful psychological views into the characters' pain and lonliness instead. The title is most fitting.<br />  The timbre of the book reminds me of the Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway), Crime and Punishment (Doestoevsky) and is somewhat similar to To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee).<br />  The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is definitely a classic that is eternally useful as it depicts human nature, pain and dysfunction just as accurately today as in the 1940's.<br />  I also recommend a new book Torn From the Inside Out.	2004-07-13
