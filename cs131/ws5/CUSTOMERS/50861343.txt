His Kirinyaga series is essentially tedious, politically correct, and frequently inane. It tells the story of a tribe that revolts against modern ways. Its witch doctor delivers simplistic homilies and everyone who thinks progress should go beyond the 15th century is evidently a fool and a knave. Don't waste your time on this tedious, rather inane series.	2005-07-03

She goes so far so often that some of her books seem like little more than soft core porn. She seems to have invented Merry Gentry, an Anita Blake clone, mostly to avoid the necessity of having to explain all the sex. In this series, sex IS the plot--Merry is ordered to have lots of it, indiscriminately. For all of that, Hamilton is a page-turning prose stylist. You just can't stop reading. You fly through the book. When she pays attention to something other than sex and bothers to set out a plot, she is quite compelling. Unfortunately her conceits are often in full display, and she is diverted too often. This is mediocre, and the Gentry series is a step back from Blake, literally amounting to nothing more than incessant and routine sex talk and scenes. It COULD be so much more. There are germs of ideas here and there. It is quite interesting occasionally. But it always falls off the cliff, with every page, seemingly, containing Gentry ogling some half-nude bodyguard in lurid and repetitive detail. It would be nice if someone woke Hamilton up. SHe is a talented writer, and soft core porn does not stretch her talent enough.	2005-05-26

In this series, Turtledove does some things right, some wrong. But I confess I am largely weary of his limited technique. This series is much better at alternate history than things like his WorldWar series with aliens. There is actually a feel here for how things might've gone had X happened. But Turtledove always writes in these jagged snippets. His only technique seems to be to tell 20 different stories at once, each in 3-6 page slices. After awhile, this can become tedious, especially if many of the characters are less than compelling, as here. Plus, the momentum of each saga is too often halted. Further,  the sense of a  &quot;whole&quot; is constantly lost. There are no grand moments or strategies. It is perplexing how major characters like Theodore Roosevelt drift into minor roles. TR could've been the central focal point from which to tell the story, to make it all make sense. Ultimately, Turtledove's trite technique renders this too episodic, too disconnected. You care less and less as it wears on. The minor characters do not serve the whole--they become it. That is not always a good thing, yet every Turtledove book seems to turn out this way. There ARE other ways to tell a story....	2004-05-15

They say this will be a movie, and it does at times remind one of the next Harry Potter. But I wonder how they will make a politically correct movie out of a trilogy whose central theme is the effort to destroy God and tear down the gates of Heaven, and whose ending involves young teens (13? or less..) evidently having sex. Its complexity and daring in both regards will have more meaning to adults than kids or teens. The first book in the trilogy (introducing Lyra's endearing character) is superb. The middle book (as middle books and movies often do...) lags a bit as the complexities of the plot are interwoven, but no conclusions or resolutions are reached. I think the first book is vastly superior to anything that follows, but perhaps the single best part of the entire series is the truly heartrending conclusion, as the heroes battle with their obligations and hearts. The conclusion, again, has overtones and layers that adults may appreciate more than kids. On the whole, the series is very well done, even if the plot complexities seem sometimes meandering, unexplained and/or often unnecessary (the Mulefa? Mary?).	2004-04-13

I like this continuation better, actually. It deals with more complex issues, and it actually HAS a little of that alternate history Turtledove fans brag so much about. Too often, in Turtledove's books, the Worldwar series being an excellent example, there is very little alternate history in the sense that we have no feel for the forces that shape history, for the decisions that different people had to make, and so one. In \\"Worldwar\\" we find that FDR, Hitler, et al have to join together, but there is little effort or detail regarding those problems. It's mostly a shoot-em-up war book with lotsa combat. Fair enough--but lets not oooh and aaah over the barely existent \\"alternate history.\\" This book does a bit better, and is more pointed than the first series. It also deals with more complex issues, for example whether someone is a traitor or hero. (...) This series is again an improvement. IN WORLDWAR it sometimes seemed as if each character would be reintroduced with every last motivation they held every last time. We could never meet Atvar for instance without being told how he regretted that Earth was an industrial power and not the primitive society he thought his probes showed. So maybe Turtledove got an editor in this series? If so it helps--although the problem is not entirely cured.	2004-03-29

The books are long winded and repetitive. If you've waded through Robert Jordan's long, never ending Wheel of Time series, you can appreciate an occasional recap to remind you of who the characters are and what their motivations are. But Turtledove not only does that from book to book, but does it constantly, mind numbingly, throughout each book. Wehrmacht Col. Jager for instance tells you almost every time you meet him of how he didn't realize Jews were being killed. Each character seems to redundantly trot out their pet themes every time they are introduced. Given that Turtledove uses the technique cut-aways to deal with competing subplots, that means this happens a lot--just about every time he returns to a particular character. How many times can we read about Ludmilla and her reaction to the attempted rape? Over and over again, evidently. They say and think the same things constantly. It is beyond tedious--it begins to be padding, a sign of an author who badly needed an editor. This series could've been brilliant as a trilogy. It's still fun as a four parter--but not perfect.	2004-03-09

Of Weber's series with Steve White, I thought this was by far the best--straight ahead, linear action, with multiple groups of aliens and cultures. The beginning of the exploration of the Orion culture was a nice touch. It is the ultimate Space Opera. What I do wonder though is what Steve White contributed to this series. Weber's fingerprints are all over this--it seems just like part of the Honor Harrington world, with similar descriptions of space battles, many similar terms (superdreadnaughts, for instance). This series seems to be an excuse for Weber to do something without Harrington and in a different political circumstance--but the military action is very familiar, and well done.	2004-02-16

Following up on the soporific &quot;Echoes of Honor,&quot; this book shows Honor back in action, and also has entertaining and detailed looks at political intrigue and military strategy. The world of Real Politik according to Weber is deliciously sinful and it is voyeuristic fun to sneak a peek. As is typical, Weber's ending is fairly abrupt. He'll spend chapters on the details, nuts and bolts of a variety of things, major to minor, but when it comes time for that ultimate battle, he wraps things up in a few pages and moves along. There are pros and cons to this.....and in this book it's partly a device to set the stage for the next sequel.<br />It's good to see Weber on track with this series again.

In this book, though, Weber gets a bit side tracked. I wouldn't go quite so far as to say he becomes Robert Jordan-ized (\\"Wheel of time\\" series--caught in molasses), but some 400 pages go by in this 635 page book with little happening. The first part of the book, you feel, was what might've ended the prior book. Ok. Take a little time. Weep and regroup. Honor's home. Then the slow pace continues for several hundred more pages. For instance, there's a good bit of a chapter devoted to Honor interviewing her lawyer! Well, that's exciting. And others on how she sets up her new house, etc. Characterization is one thing, but this is a bit of overkill. Not that all the bits are bad or boring--it's just that there are too many of them, to the point where they dominate the book rather than provide a subplot or interesting sideline. A little editing would've gone down good here. Still, a lot to like. You'll still want to read it if you're a Harrington fan. And like I say---the Robert Jordan analogy occurred to me (he, the author who became full of himself and starting writing a never-ending series that moved like molasses and angered original fans), but it's nowhere near that bad.	2004-01-16

The books do not always take the easy way out. The endings are not always as happy as they could be, and the answers are not as easy as you might think. That adds spice to the straight-line plots, which, along with the fine characterization of the heroine (if few others) make these books a &quot;can't miss, can't put down.&quot; They are potboilers in the finest sense of the word, the way Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars were.

But this series is ending with a whimper, not a bang. This once great series has become a tedious, boring mess. I promised, given all the time I invested here, to give it one more book. This was it. I'm off the train. You CAN say that this book is a little better than tedious, rambling three or so that preceded it, although that is certainly faint praise. I can't remember any more exactly where the series went off track. It seems so long ago. But at a certain point, what was the finest Sci Fantasy series ever written (exceeding Goodkind's Sword of Truth, making even Stephen Donaldson and Tolkein look to their laurels) has come crashing down into nothingness. It is now simply horrible. It commits the worst of all offenses: it is utterly boring. As it became clear no ending would occur here, I found it harder and harder to finish this. At least this time the subplots are major ones, which helps. But as before, they ramble and there is far too much irrelevant and boring discourse. In addition, this has two major flaws. One, as has been the case, and as a major reason why the series has been crippled, Rand fades into irrelevance in this book yet again. In the last few books, he hardly appears, which seems frankly amazing, a monumental misjudgment.  He does not even appear here until it is 75% done; and then only briefly. That means by definition that all the plots are subplots. It's what derails the linear plotting in the books. The most charismatic and important character never appears. On the other hand, the women, who are surely the most annoying group in the history of fiction, get more and more space andtime. (Could the series end by having all Aes Sedai killed?) So, biggest problem here: Eliminating your main character--and therefore your main plot. It is a critical error that this series has not survived, turning the last few books into boring, tedious works that have no discernible plot anddwell too much on lesser characters, and details. The second critical error is that it seems fairly obvious what happens next. Want to know what the next book will do? Rand will conclude the alliance with the Seanchan. The price of sealing it will be Matt's marriage to Tuon, and Matt will be royalty of the Seanchan. Together, the Seanchan and Rand will take out the Shaido. The White Tower and Black will align and mutually bond each other, after a battle in which Taim is defeated. Thus united, the forces will eventually head to the final battle. I may not have it all right---but there are some awfully big clues here that aren't so subtle. And there's not a whole lot of suspense. The final problem with this tedious book and the derailing of the series is that Jordan seems incapable of ever using the device of the scene cut-away. He has to spend page after tedious page going through every tedious explanation of how THIS happens or THAT occurs, or THIS is explained. This is frankly literary incompetence, nothing less. By a competent author, this series could have been concluded in 6 books--and would be vastly better for it. It now stands as a total disaster, one of the great disappointments in fiction. If you haven't started it...don't. It will break your heart. If you have---give up now. No point lining Jordan's pockets while he milks this series that is going nowhere. BTW, according to the end flap, Jordan's next book will be a Wheel PREQUEL--meaning there will be a long wait for the next book that plays back into the series plotlines or actually finishes things up (if EVER). What another monumental misjudgment. A prequel. Just what we needed.	2004-01-01

It's hard to think of a genre book I've enjoyed as much as 1632 and its sequel 1633 of late. This is a &quot;what if&quot; history---what if a small American village, ordinary folks, no experts--were suddenly transplanted to Europe in the middle of the infamous 30 Years' War...  The book wisely wastes no time on how or why it happens, but deals with the consequences from the outset. The first problem is survival, both in terms of defense from rampaging soldiers and material things in life. The second is acclimating. The third is finding allies. All are compelling, but it is with the story of King Gustav of Sweden, and the alliances undertaken against Richlieu and others, that the book really becomes special. The Americans are now forced to deal with the &quot;game of thrones,&quot; the political manipulations of the day. This carries through more strongly in fact, in the sequel. Entertaining, and written in a page turner style that makes it hard to put down. You always want to find out what happens next. And whether this little group will suceed in becoming a shining light to nations, or be swallowed up by the factions and brutalities of the time.	2003-12-01

I've generally loved Chesbro's books, but in this one and in the Language of Cannibals, he prefers to launch political diatribes rather than worry about telling a story. Whether you agree or not with his left wing tirades that turn aging hippies and former communists into heroes (as in Cannibals), if you're fair and objective, you'll agree that his eagerness to make a point interferes with his normal storytelling prowess, and his paranoia becomes a Johnny-one-note theme.

When Mongo was a new creation, he had so much Mongo-ness to him. It was so much fun reading about the determined dwarf and seeing him overcome obstacles, as Chesbro mixes in little touches of the supernatural from time to time. As the series wore on, many of the later books were great (Archangel, Sacred Stone), but the mongo-ness lessened. It was possible to forget that he was  a unique character, tho the books were good. We needed more books like &quot;Rings&quot; exploring his past. As the series continued, we started getting political tirades passing for profound understanding of the universe. Books like Language of Cannibals, and Dreams, were particularly scarred by Chesbro's paranoia. When the political tirades got trotted out--and in later books, right-wingers and the CIA are to blame for everything--the story had a way of getting lost. No surprise a lot of the paperbacks look like they're self-published in later years. So, revel in early Mongo--one of the most amusing creations ever.	2003-08-17

Chesbro goes off on some tirade to validate his political views and spends much of the book having fun yanking the right wing's chain. Inadvertently, in his book they are right actually---the KGB really has infiltrated the country. Whether you're right or left, this mindless claptrap gets in the way of the story, and is a bizarre diversion that often makes no sense. As the series  progresses, the Mongo-isms are reduced. The quirky books with a dwarf detective dabbling in the supernatural become standardized and they become routine. This is the series' nadir, though, lacking in charm, filled with irrelevant tirades. I'm working my way through the newer ones now--hope this isn't a sign of what is to come.	2003-08-07

Laurell Hamilton, if you haven't heard, has created a new heroine, so she can write about something besides Anita Blake and vamps. Of course, Merry Gentry pretty much IS Anita Blake. She talks tough. SHe's short. She's cold-hearted, so they say. She even uses the EXACT same lines like \\"Never ask anyone to do anything you wouldn't do yourself.\\" The focus is just a bit more on magic.<br />Oh yeah--she also has this obsession with kinky and rather incessant, promiscuous sex, just like Anita.  While Anita came slowly into sleeping around, Hamilton solves this problem for Gentry by a simple device: Her Queen orders Gentry to sleep around. Therefore, the whole book becomes Gentry's amorous adventures. And it has to be deemed plot related because the whole plot is basically how many studs she can sleep with. Oh, yeah. As with Anita, all the studs are very studly, with washboard abs, incredibly handsome and, um, well hung, which Hamilton usually makes graphically clear.<br />The shame of it is that Hamilton is a compelling, page turning prose stylist. She's never boring. Yet, sometimes you look up and wonder, \\"Hmmm. Did I really want porn today?\\" Her books are increasingly kinky and non-stop, rather graphic, blow-by-blow sex. Not romance. Sex.<br />I'm no prude. I'd even enjoy one or two such scenes. But when they dominate the whole book, they cause the book to lose focus. They become the book--somewhere in here, there was the makings of a plot. It gets kinda derailed. I hope Laura isn't too frustrated at home. :)	2002-06-10

I'm a big fan of this series, but Hamilton does seem to have gotten carried away with herself lately in some respects. What was a fascinating sci-fi series--an alternate world in which vamps have civil rights--and an interesting action series, and an occasionally erotic series, had begun to swerve into, well, porn, and kinky porn at that. Every monster seemed to wear skin tight leather pants with no underwear, and drop them rather randomly. Sex was their way of saying \\"Hi,\\" the kinkier the better, evidently. The sex scenes, esp. the first with Richard, got more and more graphic.  Now, I'm not a prude. This is more a practical observation: are we writing porn here, or erotically tinged Sci-Fi? I can get better porn. The plot lines sagged as Hamilton tried to write soft, and sometimes pretty close to hard, core porn, and it sometimes felt like she was losing her way. Blake went from chaste prude to wanton hussy in a hurry, all described in fairly minute detail.<br />Obsidian Butterfly takes a welcome step back.  It's not that I want the erotic nuance eliminated. Let's just remember what we're doing here. In Ob. Butterfly, Anita still ogles guys' butts, but not much else. She still projects occasionally tiresome and strident feminism (does anyone else really care if the door is held for them these days?), but backs off occasionally, too, and shows some balance. Mostly....there is good clean plotting, and the type of witty repartee fans have come to know and love. The series was almost in a rut--even though the books were well written and the dialog and inner thoughts cleverly wrought. It needed this turn, and it's very well done.	2002-03-31

The reality is that Hubris treads ground that is not as familiar. Nemesis treads ground that everyone knows from every sketcy book, movie and newspaper retrospective. It is harder to make it new and thrilling.

Still,the research is great,the issues addressed are interesting. It is worth reading, though it may put you to sleep at times.  There are certainly large portions that will be of interest to no one but a descendant (as the author is), and the prose is dense and not conducive to page-turning at times. You'll wade through this if you're a real geek--but not otherwise.	2001-10-17

There were 2 indispensable Americans in 1770s--Franklin and Washington. Both were the glue that held the revolution together. Adams may've started it; but to get beyond the New England firebrands required the Virginia gentlemen and America's most famous citizen. <br />Today his reputation is dimmed somewhat because he was a generation (or two) older than all of the others, and never became president. No one contributed more,though, as this exceptionally well researched, and even better written book demonstrates. If you're interested in history--this is hard to put down, virtually a page turner. It's rather a shame that in the fad to reevaluate Revolutionary heroes, the recent Adams bio seems to be the one that has taken off. Franklin is more important--he provided the revolutionaries with national and international credibility. He negotiated with the foreigners. He was the person even Washington was willing to defer to. Read this great book and learn about the most famous early American.	2001-10-17

Still, there is in fact precious little it has to say, and some of the chapters are simply tedious. I wish I could care about the child and the park ...<br />The little set pieces offer relatively few insights on France, although they are well written. It sometimes seems like the obligatory &quot;I was there, now read this....!&quot;  book. Nonetheless, it is a good beach read--but not deserving of its fame. It has none of the flair of Peter Mayle, for instance.	2001-10-17

It's way different--most importantly, here, the supernatural IS generally debunked, not real.<br />There's not much science in these short, prose driven novels. What the author does do well is write hilarious prose. These novels are so funny that you laugh out loud. He's got a turn of the phrase, a feel for the absurd. By the time you are done, you feel guilty for having had so much fun considering how light the plots are....!  Ps. I liked Vampires of Vermont better.	2001-10-17

Leon Adams' seminal work was becoming badly dated. Here is the update and the replacement. Every word moves the story along, and every fact is fascinating. Geeks will love it, but so will beginners. Concise, yet covers the important stuff, provides new insights, and scintillating prose.	2001-10-17

I suppose that is true, but it is much more, also.  It is easy enough to write histories of Bordeaux, and many are very entertaining, such as D. Markham's work on the 1855 Classification. But when most of us pick up a recent Bordeaux work, isn't it more helpful to hear more than &quot;Chateau Lafite is a first growth and has produced good to excellent wine in x, y and z vintages, and many others.&quot;  This is a book that takes a stand. And quite frankly, Parker's Bordeaux palate is as good as anyone's in the world. You don't have to agree with everything he says on every wine to recognize a master at work.	2000-10-05

If you are looking for a guide, you should not just examine Parker's book.  There are many wine viewpoints that are helpful in the world. But it is also hard to think of anyone that does such a comprehensive job with such talent and integrity. You don't have to agree with every opinion or every review to appreciate this unique resource.	2000-10-05

I originally thought the Sword was a more traditional, not as enriching  series, but Robert Jordan has sure begun to get annoying as the series  meanders and the characters do often incomprehensible things that seem to  relate only to male-bashing. This latest Sword episode is also a step back  from the quality of the rest of the series, but on ly a small step, unlike  Jordan's fiasco. I still enjoyed all of this book, and in fact, I wanted it  to continue longer. my only complaint is that very little of the plot lines  were resolved. It is very much an &quot;interim&quot; book.<br />I will say  one more thing: these guys need to resolve these series SOON.	2000-09-07
