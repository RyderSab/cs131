Though God created something out of nothing, the artist uses that which already exists, and shapes it into a new form. This purely aesthetic creative function is one of the central attributes that separates man from other living creatures, and when the new forms are used to glorify God, a special union takes place between the artist and his Creator. It is this particular form of imagery that Pope John Paul II addresses, giving this slim booklet special meaning for those whose endeavors are in the religious art genre.<br /><br />Some of the finest art known to mankind was inspired by faith (and much of it sponsored by the Catholic Church). These masterpieces are a far cry from what sometimes passes for art in our present age of quick fortune and fame, and that receives attention from the media and galleries, where \\"being outrageous\\" has often replaced skill and true inspiration, as well as beauty that has transforming power. He writes that an artist must not have a \\"craving for cheap popularity\\", but labor for something much greater, and \\"enrich the cultural heritage\\" of the nations and humanity. As Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot, \\"Beauty will save the world.\\"<br /><br />Pope John Paul II speaks of how the Church needs art, to bring the invisible mystery of the Gospels into form and color, as well as how artists need the Church, which offers \\"a horizon especially rich in inspiration.\\" Christian artists will appreciate this essay on the relationship between faith and beauty, and their responsibility to achieve their highest goals. Veni, Creator Spiritus...\\"Come O Creator Spirit, visit our minds, fill with your grace the hearts you have created.\\"	2005-10-12

It was also the rigorous training she put herself through, and as this wonderful book describes, she was one to arrive early and leave late, even when she was an operatic superstar.<br /><br />Written in an almost poetic style, French music critic Andr&eacute; Tubeuf talks briefly about her youth, when she was considered an \\"ugly duckling\\" and her older sister (ironically named Jackie) was the pretty one. Maria was myopic, and \\"stuffed herself with sweets,\\" which led to her having a \\"substantial figure.\\" One can hardly imagine this, as the vision in our minds of Callas is of a svelte and fashionable woman, but there are 2 gorgeous photographs in this book that prove that in her early days she was quite Rubinesque, and quite a beauty.<br /><br />Callas was at her peak in the 1950s, when her best recordings were made, making music that is treasured today, and for all time. Tubeauf covers this period, and then tells of how her fame, and her long relationship with Ari Onassis (who cast her aside for a bigger trophy, the widow of a president), led to her final years of isolation. Tubeauf compares her stardom that rose to mythical proportions to Garbo and Monroe, and says, \\"Callas was first devoured by art and then the woman was destroyed by the fires of celebrity.\\"<br /><br />There are only 14 pages of text in this book, the bulk of it consists of fabulous photos, in and out of costume, with some that are most unusual, like one of her conversing with Winston Churchill, aboard Onassis' yacht. There is always sadness behind the glamour in these images of an \\"ugly duckling\\" that became one of the world's most famous swans. The photographs are not interrupted by descriptions, these come at the end of the book, next to thumbnails of them, and there is also a chronology that is helpful for those wanting to learn more about La Divina Callas. This is a small book, but it has the quality of a coffee table volume, with thick, glossy pages, and sturdy construction, and is a must for opera and Callas fans.also a chronology that is helpful for those wanting to learn more about La Divina Callas.

Klimt's dazzling paintings were innovative, and would often shock the academicians, but are now some of the most reproduced works in the world, and what we often associate with that era of Viennese society. Elizabeth Hickey, in her debut novel, captures the atmosphere of the city, and gives us glimpses from her imagination of the lives of many of the great artistic forces of the time, such as Gustav Mahler, and Josef Hoffmann.<br /><br />The book begins in October of 1944, as an elderly Emilie leaves her beloved Vienna, now under Nazi occupation, for the safety of her house in Attersee, familiar to us because of the lovely landscapes Klimt painted there. Emilie in the following chapters retraces her memories, starting with her 12th birthday, when she first met Klimt. There are short chapters that are specifically about certain paintings, and are fascinating, and show Klimt as an artist at work. Hickey has a deep understanding of art, and the inventive spirit, and how the true artist will guard his gift jealously, and keep it free from extraneous entanglements. Klimt embodies these characteristics, and though he loved women, the most they could expect from him was a likeness in the permanence of paint on canvas. This is what Klimt did for Emilie, in the magnificent portrait that can be seen on the cover.<br /><br />Hickey's style is elegant and graceful, with the ability to describe nature and humanity in exquisite detail, without ever crossing the fine line into over-embellishment. Like an artist who instinctively knows when the last brush stroke has completed a painting, her paragraphs and chapters seem perfectly balanced and sized. This book is not a \\"page turner\\" full of thrills and lusty scenes, so popular in today's fiction, it is instead one to savor for its insight, its beautifully written story, and a visual quality in its use of language that is so appropriate to its subject matter. As an artist, I have always felt a kinship with Klimt's work, and his persona, and this book reveals much of his soul, as seen through the eyes of a woman who loved him, but knew she could never posses him. It is a book of serene passion, a combination that takes a rare talent. I look forward to reading more from Ms. Hickey, who has much of this uncommon gift.pular in today's fiction, it is instead one to savor for its insight, its beautifully written story, and a visual quality in its use of language that is so appropriate to its subject matter.

It has many quotes from theologians like Francis Schaeffer and John Knox, and expresses thoughts on marriage, as well as the church accepting new teachings \\"for the sake of private human interests,\\" \\"faith vs. works,\\" and whether the commands of Jesus are an \\"obligation or option.\\" The introduction also has the \\"criteria for inclusion\\" the author used when choosing the commands that are part of the 125 in the book, explained with graphics, and includes a list of the commands that were excluded.<br /><br />The 125 commands of Jesus are written in bold type (the New Revised Standard Version Bible is used), often with a Greek translation for better understanding, and then analyzed with great clarity by Peter Wittstock. His knowledge is equaled by his insight, and I was inspired as well as illuminated by his penetrating wisdom. There are many books on the market that analyze Scripture, but I found this one to be exceptional in its lucidity and purpose. Whether one simply reads one of the commands and meditates upon its meaning, or takes in several at one sitting, one will invariably gain discernment, and more invaluable than anything, the commands will bring one into a closer relationship with the Lord. The writing is profound, yet simple and easy to understand, and the book itself is of fine quality, with a nice large font size.<br /><br />There is much of value in the back of the book, with a glossary, bibliography, command category index, and much more. Of very special interest is appendix A, a poetic revelation received by the author on the morning of September 11, 2001. It is intensely moving, with a searing reality that some would rather not face. I applaud the author for his courage, and for putting a lamp of truth in a dark place.g reality that some would rather not face.

This miraculous \\"sun\\" was with her for forty-seven years, until her death at age sixty-eight. People of all strata of society came to her for advice and healing, from the poverty stricken, to nobility, to the leaders of the church.<br /><br />She was a humble woman born in Sienna in 1769 \\"to a world in chaos\\". During her lifetime, Europe was in a state of constant upheaval, the church under siege, with some of the events during her lifetime being the French Revolution, Rome under oppressive French Directoire, and the imprisonment of Pope Pius VI.<br /><br />Anna Maria led an austere, simple life, with her seven children and husband Domenico, whose boisterous temperament contrasted with hers, and who was a servant at the Chigi palace. Domenico, as well as her daughter Sophie, are quoted extensively from their depositions after her death in this book.<br /><br />She renounced the ways of the world, and searched out the will of the Lord, and followed the advice to \\"always pull against the stream and never cease to resist one's own will\\".<br /><br />Her visions covered a wide span of time (she saw \\"black airships traversing the skies\\") though the book does not dwell on her future revelations, but mostly describes her day to day life, and how she helped the many who would ask for her healing and help.  The book also has little insights into her personality, as when a domestic broke a bottle, Anna Maria consoled her by saying \\"It is nothing. We must, after all, feed the crockery-makers\\".<br /><br />Translated from the French, the book is also an interesting glimpse into life during a turbulent era, and important time in the history of the Catholic Church.	2005-06-15

The illustrations in this fabulous little book are a delight, with rich colors, expressive animals, and marvelous details. The dancing bears float across the sky like a Chagall painting, play instruments, and drive a nifty little orange car; There are also many other lovable creatures, and sometimes you have to look carefully to find all the rabbits and squirrels hidden in the foliage.<br /><br />The human element is a sweet brown haired girl in a blue dress and floppy flowered hat, and who is afraid of the storm. Her mother introduces her to the bears, and she starts to see the storm as a friendly, magical event.<br /><br />The highlight for me is the big cat trio with the lion playing the violin, and the verse for this is:<br /><br />\\"Then the lions and leopards and lynx play the strings.<br /><br />Hear them howling and yowling the way the wind sings\\".<br /><br />All the verses are simple but well written, and have an imaginative charm that goes well with the pictures.<br /><br />As an artist/illustrator, I take my hat off to the award winning Phoebe Stone, for her unique and exquisite work in this book. Stone also has made a name for herself as a fine artist, and \\"When the Wind Bears Go Dancing\\" was the first children's book she both wrote and illustrated. Art pieces from this book have been exhibited at the Boston area DeCordova Museum, and at The Society of Illustrators in New York City, and my favorite \\"lion and violin\\" illustration graced the cover of Booklist Magazine.<br /><br />If you have a child who is afraid of nature's wilder moments, this book will help to calm their negative feelings, and bring a sense of adventure to scary elements like lightning, wind and rain.<br /><br />The paper is of nice quality, with a semi gloss sheen, and the color reproduction is superb.	2005-05-25

Wigmore was a vibrant 76 when she wrote this book in 1985, with her weight the same as it was in her youth, and her hair returned to its natural brown. She explains everything you need to know about wheatgrass, and there is a lot to know about this most basic of all plants.<br /><br />In the early chapters she notes the scientific data, Chapter 6 is about what wheatgrass can do for you, including weight control by \\"speeding up blood circulation and metabolic rate\\". Chapter 7 has instructions on how to grow it and juice it, and in Chapter 8, the many uses, including some nice mixtures to juice up a tasty and nutritious \\"green drink\\".<br /><br />Wigmore explains \\"free radicals\\", and the damage they do to our cells, enzymes, and the power of chlorophyll, which is plentiful in wheatgrass. It is also an excellent source of Vitamin C, Vitamin A (in the form of carotene), B Complex, Vitamin E, and minerals like calcium and zinc.<br /><br />Wigmore describes how to set up an indoor growing area, but for those of us who live in all-year-around temperate climates like Southern California, can like me set up a growing corner on a patio. I use roasting pans, buy my wheat at the local health food store (the red wheat is delicious, and very inexpensive), and use good soil.<br /><br />Wheatgrass is powerful, so it's good to know all you can about it before using it, and adhere to the warnings to start with small quantities.<br /><br />An invaluable book for anyone interested in joining \\"The Green Revolution\\", to improve their health, need less sleep, and enjoy the many other advantages of wheatgrass, and if you have cats, they'll like to nibble on it too.	2005-05-25

The photographs are usually in profile (except for the owls), with good color reproduction, for ease of identification.<br /><br />Published in the U.K., the paper quality is a nice semi-gloss heavy stock, and there is one index in the back of common names, and another for Latin names.<br /><br />Written by Michael Vanner, whose mini bio says is \\"an enthusiastic birder who has spent many years studying the wild life of Northern America\\", the text is concise and clear, and the only thing I find missing is any description of the bird's song, but for the casual birdwatcher, who enjoys identifying our feathered friends by sight, this is a good book to have in one's library.	2005-05-10

There is also a section about a predicted comet, and another on the quatrains of Nostradamus, which are made understandable by Dupont's analysis.<br />Dupont brilliantly puts together all these pieces to make a coherent whole in this small, readable volume. It is also interesting to compare these prophecies with their non-Catholic Christian kin (as in the \\"Left Behind\\" series), which are remarkably similar, but with some distinctive differences in interpretation.<br /><br />Dupont's last update for this book was in 1973; I'm sure he would be amazed at how the world has progressed toward the visions he has presented in this volume.  Some examples:<br />Dupont wonders how one man could rule Europe (the coming \\"Great King\\"), not knowing about the EU, that makes this seem quite reasonable now.<br />The rise of warring \\"Mohammedans\\" is a central focus of most of these prophecies. Today this sounds like the daily newscast.

The only thing missing from this volume is a map, and I do recommend looking at an atlas before delving into this terrific book to see how vast this country is, and where it lies in relation to its neighbors.<br /><br />There is an epilogue that updates us to the present time, with the many changes, normalization, and improvements, and even a change of capitals, from Almaty to Astana (formerly known as Aknola).<br />This is one of the very best books I have read in this genre, and I hope it is just the beginning of Rosten's career as a writer. I await further intriguing tales of far-off lands, and many more laughs from this skilled and very entertaining author.	2005-04-11

It is a brilliant section of the book, and very thought provoking.<br /> This small volume is sturdy and has a solid, weighty feel. The layout is lovely and each chapter is prefaced with a Bible verse and a flag, and the font size is very easy to read; because it is attractive as well as illuminating, this book would make a wonderful gift, a gift that will be treasured, and will connect the reader with this great prayer.<br />Mike Jeffress has given America a gift from his heart, his knowledge, and his love for country and God, and it is much appreciated.iven America a gift from his heart, his knowledge, and his love for country and God, and it is much appreciated.	2005-03-29

Any plan that could do better than the current status quo should be given consideration, and Sheryl's plan would certainly have less recidivism than what we have now, with so many who, if they experience well-being after treatment at all, find it short-lived.<br /><br />Is it too expensive ?<br />Not if you consider what we are paying now for a system that is not producing results, and not if you consider that if people are made well and productive, how they would enhance our economy.<br />Sheryl's vision has a strong spiritual heart, and the acknowledgement of a Creator, something certain sectors in our society are trying to eradicate, as judges who endorse and further the agenda of radical groups make laws that are systematically tearing God out of the fabric of our lives. It is my hope that the tide of this often nihilistic secularism be stemmed, and The Manor of Eden has ideas that if implemented could help do this.<br /><br />In Part III, Sheryl writes about childhood memories, of the farm she grew up on, and the boarding school she was sent to at the age of 14; we all have different sensibilities, and what was good for other family members was not good for Sheryl, and what she experienced there would influence the rest of her life in negative ways, but also surely had a hand in her vision of \\"The Manor of Eden\\", making all things ultimately work for the best.

She writes as one would talk, about ordinary things, and what she values the most, without any gloss of pretension, and cuts through the superfluous to reach what is true and real; Ana writes of her children, her husband who suffered with Alzheimer's disease, her adorable dogs, and two choice poems are \\"tough love\\" pieces, \\"Dry and Cynical\\" (pg. 96), and \\"It Takes Two\\" (pg. 151).<br /><br />I was wondering how to rate this book, until I hit \\"Christmas Tree\\", and had a reaction to it that made this a five star volume...there was so much depth to its simplicity, as there is with many of the poems. A musician with equal talent should set some of these pieces to music; they would go well with a lovely melody.<br />The layout of the book is excellent, and in the back there are photos of the stunningly attractive Monnar family.<br />What a blessing to know that Ana is a teacher, guiding and having an impact on young minds that will perhaps influence generations after them.	2005-03-13

Beautiful as well as intelligent and strong, she's been the one that has kept the family of 3 boys and one girl (the stunning and talented Louise Dorsey) together, and \\"stood by her man\\" through thick and thin.

My favorite accompanies the initial verse:<br /><br />\\"I looked out my window a week ago,<br /><br />When a small Saw-Whet Owl...<br /><br />  told me things I should know\\".<br /><br />It has an old window in the foreground, the owl in a pine branch beyond it, and trees in the background, looking to be at least three layers deep and perhaps more, and gives a terrific effect.<br /><br />The final page gives data of this adorable creature, from the sound of his screech to his diet, habitat, and more.	2005-02-07

The text by Andrea Weber is minimal but excellent; it gives a sketch of Duccio's life (of which little is known) and times, his place in the artistic life of Siena, and the many commissions he received, the greatest which is the magnificent Maesta. Now surviving only in a fragmentary state, it is in this book \\"built up of reconstructions\\" in a \\"photographic montage\\" of how most of it must have looked, bringing together the many pieces that are now scattered world-wide. It also has a map of the \\"hypothetical reconstruction\\", showing where each piece would have been placed.<br /><br />The text gives an analysis of each piece, including several Madonnas, the most famous is the Rucellai Madonna (1285), which now resides in Florence's Uffizi, and the following eighty-five pages are given to the Maesta, which was commissioned in 1308. The enormity and complexity of what remains of this work is truly awesome, and the beauty of this book is that it is the closest that we will get to see it in its entirety.<br /><br />The last pages are of his \\"Late Works\\", and are of two triptyches and one polyptych.<br /><br />Duccio's colors are deep and rich, and his figures exquisitely expressive. Favorite pieces from the Maesta for me are the main panel, with a loving Madonna holding a Christ Child clothed in the most delicate, diaphanous garments, The Entry Into Jerusalem, with some marvelous perspective for the time in which this was painted, and The Crucifixion, with its agonized Christ figure gazing down on the almost fainting form of Mother Mary.<br /><br />A \\"must have\\" for anyone who likes iconic art or the superb work of the early Italian masters, the paper used in this book is thick and glossy, and it is a wonderful addition to any art lover's book collection.s a wonderful addition to any art lover's book collection. <br />	2005-02-02

This is a very well researched book, and if you check out his facts, you'll be horrified to find they are 100% correct. His chapter on the courts, and what is happening to the judicial system (Ch. 2, \\"Stench from the Bench\\") is a must read, to find out how our tax dollars are funding the absurdity of Leftist agendas, and perhaps the most important chapter is the one on the education system, (Ch. 8 and 9). He also disects the problems in health care, the media and the military, faith and morality, and \\"The Silenced Majority\\", a majority I spent far too many years in; it's time for us to stand up and be counted, and this book is one of the ways to help us strengthen those leg muscles for what may be a very long march against the tide of socialism.<br /><br />It is also very entertaining: Savage is a language maven and has thought up words that deserve their own dictionary, and has a way of describing things in a graphic, visual manner. His verbal picture of the map of America, when viewed as an animal (pg. 152-153), is one of the most hilarious passages I've ever encountered anywhere.<br /><br />Though Savage is a tough guy always ready with an insult, he is also a very deep and caring man, and like a cut diamond, brilliant and very sharp.<br /><br />I don't always agree with him, but I listen, because he makes me think, and break the silence kept for decades, a sheeple no more.	2005-01-08

Well researched and an easy read, this is a good portrait of President Bush and those who surround him, from the friends he made at Yale who are still the friends he holds dear and trusts, to those closest to him in the administration; especially interesting are sections on the two strong and brilliant women who are close to him, Condoleezza Rice and Karen Hughes.<br /><br />There is a section in Chapter 9 on the inner workings of the White house, and how it got to be the complex place it is now, with digital locators tracking every move of the First Family that is fascinating, as well as a rundown of things that happened behind the scenes on and immediately after 9/11, and the deterioration of the FBI under Louis Freeh (appointed in '93), who disdained technology and let the computer system in the department become totally inadequate for the needs of the time.<br />Mr. Kessler also covers incidents by the previous occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, terrible examples of how power corrupts, and what rudeness to those that serve in menial positions says about the state of a soul, as I believe one can tell more about a person from observing how they treat a waitress than by reading their personal journal.<br />Sixteen pages of b&w photographs, notes indicating Mr. Kessler's sources, and a bibliography complete the volume.<br /><br />If you are like some of my Liberal friends who have allowed hatred to close their minds to any rational view or open discussion about President Bush (and nothing obstructs the brain cells like hatred), this book will probably make you gag, not only because it presents a man who is intelligent, disciplined, immensely likable, but one who is able to laugh at his own foibles...and there are few more engaging traits than self-effacing humor.<br />As for myself, I admire and respect President Bush, for his convictions and his courage to implement them, and found this book if not a great book, very informative, and at times quite entertaining.	2004-11-05

This book, in conjunction with the Bible (Reimann recommends one to read this with one hand and the Bible in the other) are guideposts for a meaningful life.<br /><br />Not a \\"God loves you and all is well\\" type of book, there are many passages of tough love, that keep one on the right track, and I often have the experience of it answering a question that is on my mind. Each day under the header, is a relevant Bible quote, and underneath Chambers' teaching on the subject, in the 250 word range in length. There are various editions to chose from, and mine is a small leather-bound volume using the NKJV for its Bible quotes, with a foreword by Charles Stanley, who as Reimann's pastor, was the one who recommended the original Chambers work to him.<br />The back of the book has two useful sections, a Subject Index, and a Scripture Index.<br />As the end of the year approaches, I'm looking forward to reading this on a daily basis for the second time, and every year thereafter; its teachings are invaluable, and I believe this is a truly inspired work, that will guide and nurture all who read its truth.	2004-10-04

Editorial, September 12, 2001 (pg.17).<br /><br />The last 100 pages are about Afghanistan, and have a decidedly slanted feel to them; it is the U.S. bombs that are causing the problems, not the terror of the Taliban, who are being tortured and executed by the Northern Alliance soldiers (there is a play-by-play photographic study as the Alliance \\"drag a wounded Taliban soldier out of a ditch\\" and as the \\"terrified man begged for his life\\" brutally kill him).<br /><br />With sometimes subtle semantics, and sometimes not, this part of the book was definitely written by the \\"blame America first\\" crowd.<br /><br />The strength of this book is in the superb photography; from the moving, wrenching reminders of the planes going into the towers (with some spectacular aerial shots) and the heroism of the firefighters, to the regal  portrait of Hamid Karzai in its final pages, it is a reminder of a day that changed the world, and time we should never forget.<br /><br />With thick, semi-gloss pages and excellent photo reproduction, this is a well made, high quality publication.<br /><br />\\"These acts shattered steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve\\".

She sits in her brown woolen dress in the grand drawing room of Hathaway Hall, waiting to hear the reading of Sir Nigel Montfort's will, expecting to receive a small bequest. Seated in the front by the fire is Sir Nigel's tall, handsome nephew, in fashionable city attire, and a casual air. The rest of the story is predictable, and there are few surprises, but it's a light and sometimes amusing read.<br /><br />It is written in a crisp, clear style, with the utmost precision and correctness, and with a well integrated vocabulary. There are few repeated words, a trap some well-known authors have been known to fall into, and this would be an excellent book for women studying English as a second language. They would learn many new words, along with good grammar and punctuation, all in a pleasant and easily read book; and it's good clean fun, with very little in the way of steamy dialogue.<br /><br />This was Louise Bergin's first Regency style novel; it won the Royal Ascot contest, and went on to be a finalist in the prestigious Golden Heart Awards. The print is distinct and in a font size comfortable to the eyes, and the cover art is very well done, though I could not find credit given to the artist anywhere in the book.	2004-07-23

It is good to know from the source, instead of from the endless fountain of propaganda that spews forth from both sides of the aisle.<br />There is an introduction by editor Thomas M. Freiling, on how he went about compiling this collection of 34 speeches and talks that vary in tone and expression from formal to those with the cadence of a relaxed conversation, that read as though being spoken rather than written.<br />Each chapter is headed with the date of the speech, but not the place it was given, but some are obvious, as the one given in England in November, 2003, which is one of the longest, at 15 pages. Most of the chapters average 4-5 pages, and many touch on controversial subjects, like the rights of unborn children, and the current debate over stem cell research. &quot;On Respect for Life&quot; is a thoughtful analysis on the crucial questions that are a part of the complex issue of stem cells, and President Bush talks about both sides of subject, and why and how he came to his final decision, when he confronted the &quot;fundamental questions about the beginnings of life, and the ends of science&quot;.<br />&quot;On Cuba and Castro&quot; from May 20, 2002, is another chapter that is important to read.<br />&quot;On Justice&quot;, from July 2001, includes a welcoming address from Pope John Paul II, and is one of the eight chapters that pre-date the horror that changed our country, and President Bush's task in office. &quot;On Resolve&quot;, from September 14, 2001, is a profound and moving chapter on those events, that is also life-affirming, and full of hope for the future.<br />As it is written in Matthew 12:34, &quot;out of the overflow of the heart, a man speaks&quot;, and this is an essential book to read, if one wants to know the heart of George W. Bush, and the ideas that motivate him.otivate him.	2004-07-19

Marin also writes the insightful introduction, and there are excellent and informative essays by Max Benavidez, Constance Cortez, and Tere Romero, as well as mini bios of the 26 artists represented in the volume.<br /><br />Among the highlights for me are the 4 pictures by George Yepes, that include his \\"La Pistola y el Corazon,\\" which was the cover for the Los Lobos CD of the same title (pg. 144), the 10 pages of the glorious, impressionistic work of Carlos Almaraz, especially \\"Southwest Song,\\" with its horse and rider and splashy moonlit sky (pg. 53), and Leo Limon, starting with his \\"Frida and Palomas\\" through his complex  symbolic storytelling in \\"Los Muertos\\" (93-99). I recently had the opportunity to view Frank Romero's work at the Icaro Gallery in Long Beach, California, and was thrilled by his rich use of color, and his sense of humor, both aspects which are well illustrated on pages 108 through 117.<br /><br />The layout of the this book is excellent, and the color reproduction superb; on thick glossy pages, the work comes alive, excites and inspires, and will not be forgotten. This is work that will stand the test of time, and as Marin writes, the viewer is \\"...transported to a place both timeless and immediate, that provides the ultimate validation for this new movement in art.\\"	2004-06-27

One of my favorite comparisons is that of the widow who gave her two mites, all she had (Luke 21: 1-4), with Gateley's experience as a missionary in Africa and of being given three tiny eggs wrapped in banana leaves, as a gift of gratitude.<br />Each chapter begins with a portion of scripture that pertains to the woman in the painting, and continues with an average of ten pages of poetic text. The twelve portraits and  chapters are: Elizabeth, Anna the Prophetess, Mary, The Widow's Mite, Martha, The Infirm Woman, The Samaritan Woman, The Woman Caught in Adultery, The Woman with the Hemorrhage, The Daughter of Jairus (which is the lovely portrait on the cover), The Penitent Woman, Mary Magdalene, and there is a thirteenth portrait of a mother and child next to the preface page that is unidentified.<br />Perhaps my favorite is the one of Mary, with her large, luminous, wise and sad eyes, entirely clothed in white, set against a halo of golden tiles.<br />Louis Glanzman is an extraordinary artist, who has also painted twelve portraits of men of the Bible in a book titled &quot;Soul Brothers&quot;, and among his many accomplishments are eighty covers for Time Magazine, and the illustration of the &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; children's book series.<br />Edwina Gately has authored many books, among them &quot;A Mystical Heart&quot;, and is the founder of the Volunteer Missionary Movement.	2004-05-06

If you found inspiration and value in Gibson's &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, you will appreciate this book, which brings to light aspects one misses even after several viewings of the film.	2004-05-06

As author Richard Rohr says in his preface, &quot;Glanzman's art is to reveal the very soul of an individual&quot;, so from each piece, came a chapter on the biblical character that is insightful and instructive. Though the title indicates that this book is intended for Christian men, it will enlighten everyone who reads it and reflects on the portraits and the words. The chapters begin with a short excerpt of scripture that applies to the person, and the twelve portraits are: Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah, John the Baptist, Peter, Paul, Timothy, John the Evangelist, Elijah, Joseph, and Jesus.<br />It starts with Abraham, a profile of a sun-weathered man, fearless and confident that God will be his shield, with a little ram in a corner, his horns caught in a thicket. The text begins with portions of Genesis 15, and continues with the concept of sacrifice throughout the ages, and the true sacrifice which is the surrender of the ego.<br />Other favorites are David, pictured as youthful, tenderly looking after a lamb, who in turn has an air of peace and security; the text analyses the king, warrior, magician and lover archetypes.<br />Timothy is the only one pictured who does not show power and toughness; Timothy is depicted as a slight and frail young man, and the text points out his strength of character, despite his lack of physical vigor.<br />Elijah, the handsome, pensive profile that is on the cover, with the ravens who fed him flying through a deep blue sky.<br />The portrait of Jesus is the reason I bought this book. The beauty and majesty of it is riveting, with eyes that seem to look into one's soul. I am sure it is a depiction of the Lord that will become a classic image for all time.<br />Born in 1922, the art of Louis Glanzman has been shown with enormous success for many decades; I remember being so moved by his portrait of Bobby Kennedy in June of 1968,  which was one of his 80 covers for Time Magazine. He has illustrated children's books, and done a marvelous series on opera, but this is his latest work, and I think his greatest.which was one of his 80 covers for Time Magazine.

It made much sense to me, and this little volume will be very enlightening to anyone who has had a &quot;near-death&quot; type of experience, &quot;visitations&quot;, or anything that has given one a glimpse of another dimension, and needs insight into the mysteries of it.<br />It will also point out the urgent need for prayer, and Maria explains of her visitations from people of other religions, that &quot;anyone who lives his faith well is happy&quot;.<br />There is a  piety and goodness that shines from Maria Simma on these pages, and her testimony is most inspiring; she was 82 when this was written in 1997, living in a mountain village in Austria, and the way she relates her spiritual history is direct and with much humility; part of the praise must also go to Sister Emmanuel of Medjugorje, for asking Maria pertinent and intelligent questions. There is a tiny photograph of both of them, with radiant smiles, that is a joy to behold.<br />Full of wisdom and faith, this small book has greatly blessed me.	2004-04-24

Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824) stated repeatedly of her visions, which were recorded for this book during a seven week period in 1823 by her friend Clement Brentano, that there were details she could not remember, or &quot;what I have not forgotten I cannot find words to express&quot;, and in another, &quot;I saw nothing distinctly&quot;. I think this lends credibility to what she did say, in that she did not fabricate to &quot;fill in the holes&quot; of her visions. Another thing to remember is that it must have been as difficult to describe events 1800 years in the past, in ancient Judea, as it would have been to go 200 years into the future; how would she have explained a television or the Los Angeles freeway system ?<br />Sister Emmerich's visions give tremendous insight into the last hours of Jesus, especially the agony at Gethsemane. As Oswald Chambers would point out in his writings, that Gethsemane should be viewed &quot;in light of His earlier wilderness temptation-'...the devil...departed from Him until an opportune time' (Luke 4:13)&quot;. Here our Lord confronts Satan in the garden, and he also sees His future Church, &quot;They had weathercocks on their roofs, and their doctrines changed with the wind&quot; (pg.111).<br />Part I is a short biography of Sister Emmerich, of whom much calumny has been spread in recent months by professional hatemongers who crave the media spotlight, because these writings inspired a few scenes in Mel Gibson's film &quot;The Passion&quot;, but one should consider the source when listening to them.<br />Part II is the preparation for Passover and The Last Supper, and Part III, which is the bulk of the book, The Passion. There are three final chapters that deal with the Resurrection, and an appendix on Longinus (whose lance pierced the Lord's side), and Abenadar, the centurion who was later known as St. Ctesiphon.<br />Sister Emmerich had many rich descriptions of the central figures connected with the Passion; of Pilate she saw him as a weak, undecided and despicable character, who would do any unjust act &quot;provided it answered his ends&quot;...&quot;his sole desire was to entail no risk upon himself&quot;; she also not only saw into the past, but into other realms, like Satan taunting Judas, and the angels ministering to Jesus, and of corrupt Christians of the &quot;first and all succeeding ages, even to the end of the world&quot;.<br />I think these writings illuminate Bible study and one's walk with the Lord, and are of great value, but probably more to Christians already fairly well versed in scripture, otherwise they might create more confusion than clarity.rection, and an appendix on Longinus (whose lance pierced the Lord's side), and Abenadar, the centurion who was later known as St. Ctesiphon.<br />Sister Emmerich had many rich descriptions of the central figures connected with the Passion; of Pilate she saw him as a weak, undecided and despicable character, who would do any unjust act &quot;provided it answered his ends&quot;...&quot;his sole desire was to entail no risk upon himself&quot;; she also not only saw into the past, but into other realms, like Satan taunting Judas, and the angels ministering to Jesus, and of corrupt Christians of the &quot;first and all succeeding ages, even to the end of the world&quot;.<BR>I think these writings illuminate Bible study and one's walk with the Lord, and are of great value, but probably more to Christians already fairly well versed in scripture, otherwise they might create more confusion than clarity.	2004-04-12

Well constructed with an imitation leather look on the cover, the font size is not large, but it is in bold print, and very readable and easy on the eyes.<br />What it has:<br />A presentation page.<br />\\"Daily Bible Readings,\\" giving a table of three systems for reading the Bible in one year.<br />A seven page history of the Bible, and how the King James Version came to be. First published in 1611, there were several subsequent revisions, and the version we read today is most like the 1769 revision.<br />What it does not have that you would likely find in a better quality Bible:<br />It has no cross-references, making it a poor Bible for study.<br />The words of Jesus are not printed in red.<br />It has no concordance.<br />No maps.<br />No ribbon marker.<br /><br />Many people use a modern language Bible for study, enabling greater clarity and understanding (and I recommend the New King James Version, or the one I have used for years, the Amplified Bible), but the King James Version is nevertheless glorious in its language, should be read at least once in a lifetime, and is invaluable for comparison of texts, and though I feel it is a sadly short-sighted view, some consider the King James Version as simply great \\"literature,\\" comparing it to Shakespeare, and read it only for the beauty of its prose.<br />Due to this edition not having cross-references, it does not make a good primary Bible, but will be more than adequate as a secondary translation, and the King James Bible is a version one should definitely own.<br /><br />Psalm 66:19<br />King James Version: \\"But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.\\"<br />New King James Version: \\"But certainly God has heard me; He has attended to the voice of my prayer.\\"<br />Amplified Bible: \\"But certainly God has heard me; He has given heed to the voice of my prayer.\\"	2004-04-08

The cover is the finest, softest leather, with a flexibility that lets it mold into one's hand; it is a tactile delight. The size is ideal, making it not too heavy for long periods of reading, and also for taking to church.<br />The gold-edged pages are of an excellent paper quality, with print that is a comfortable font size for the eyes. Some of the other features include:<br />Several pages for family information, like marriages, etc., and for family trees.<br />9 maps.<br />A nice concordance.<br />The words of Jesus are in red.<br />It does not however, have a center reference column.<br /><br />A short history of the KJV: In 1604, the Bibles in use in England were The Geneva Bible, The Great Bible, and The Bishop's Bible, and the Puritans requested of King James I a new translation. He commisioned 47 translators who started in 1607, and the first version was released in 1611, with many revisions since. The version we see today is similar to the 1769 edition.<br />The language is exquisite, and everyone should have a copy of the KJV and read it at least once in their lifetime; however, for the most clarity and understanding in one's daily reading, many are recommending a newer translation; my personal preference is for both the New King James Version, and the Amplified Bible. The Nelson's Signature Series Bible that I am saving up for is their NKJV edition, which I can't resist looking at and touching every time I go to my local Christian bookstore; it is truly a dream Bible.<br /><br />Psalm 39:4<br />KJV: \\"Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am\\".<br />NKJV: \\"Lord, make me to know my end, and what is the measure of my days, that I may know how frail I am\\".<br />Amplified Bible: \\"Lord, make me to know my end and (to appreciate) the measure of my days-what it is; let me know and realize how frail I am (how transient is my stay here).	2004-03-26

The Prophetess is a very brave soul, and addresses subjects that most people dare not mention. We are enriched by her wisdom and her honesty, and there is a biblical basis to everything she says.<br />You will weep when you face your past and see the mistakes, but how the truth sets us free !<br />This book will shine a light into the dark corners of your heart, and shake off the emotional cobwebs, and it is all from The Word.<br />The Prophetess will guide you through &quot;The Process of Purification&quot;.

I find it a valuable source book to get clarity on the historical aspects of the Bible, especially the Old Testament; as an example, following the chronological order of the rulers once the kingdoms were divided can be very confusing, and this book has a marvelous chart (much better than some presented by other dictionaries of this type and price range) with a side-by-side comparison. Another good chart is &quot;The Parables of Jesus&quot;, telling where they appear, and in how many of the Gospels.<br />Heavily illustrated with black and white photos, with small but clear and easy to read print, this is not a &quot;quality production&quot;; the paper is thicker, but similar to what is used for phone books, but for the price, it is a tremendous value; it is fascinating just to peruse, with no particular aim in mind, through subjects like &quot;Plants of the Bible&quot;, and &quot;Occupations and Trades&quot;.<br />It has nine excellent maps at the back of the book, charted with an index and &quot;Area&quot; letters and numbers, which simplifies finding places, example: Masada, Map 6, Area B5.<br />It also has a &quot;Teaching Outline on Books of the Bible&quot;, which is useful if you are reading a Bible that does not include one at the beginning of each book<br />I find I refer to this dictionary daily; once purchased, it is one of those &quot;how did I get along without this ?&quot; type of book.

With this book we can remember this magnificent film, and the impact it has had on our lives.<br />The outline of the film, portions of the script (by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald), as well as the Biblical references to each scene, are alongside still photographs taken during the filming by Ken Duncan and Philippe Antonello.<br />The marvel of this book is that one can examine at leisure the extraordinary work that went into the production design by Francesco Frigeri, the set decoration by Carlo Gervasi...take note of the marvelous oil lamp &quot;tree&quot; on pg. 43, that is in the governor's quarters...and the amazing costume design by Maurizio Millenotti, which I can only assume must have had hand-loomed cloth made especially for them.<br />Jim Caviezel is in my opinion the most perfect depiction of Jesus on film, physically strong enough to be a first century carpenter, and with a face that reminds me of Masaccio's Lord.<br />The sublime photographs for me are the Jesus on pg. 25, in a flashback scene while at home with Mary working on a table; Mary, in an outstanding portrayal by Romanian actress Maia Morgenstern, with her face to the floor, as she senses Jesus below in an underground cell on pg. 38; Mary Magdalene, beautiful in every way as played by Monica Bellucci on pg. 73; and most astounding, on pg. 114, His feet. Nailed and red with blood, this photograph moves me to tears, a work of astonishing art as well as faith.<br />The final six pages contain photos from the production.

It is a blend of the dream world and reality, with Godfather Drosselmeier, who was &quot;small and thin, with a sea of wrinkles on his face&quot;, manipulating these fantastic fantasies. The story centers around little Marie, and The Nutcracker who comes to life, to battle the Mouse King.<br />There is no Santa Claus on Christmas Eve in this tale, but it is the Christ Child who visits children &quot;on his shining wings&quot; and brings them presents.<br />E.T.A. Hoffmann (1776-1822), who also wrote tales that inspired the Offenbach opera &quot;Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (which later became a film with wonderful dancing by Moira Shearer), wrote The Nutcracker in 1816, and this translation from the German by Major Alex Ewing was first published in 1886.<br />Hoffmann was one of the first writers to use the horror/fantasy genre to such great effect, and was an influence on Edgar Allan Poe, among others.<br />Roberto Innocenti's illustrations are perhaps the prime reason to purchase this book. A self-taught artist, Innocenti has worked in animation, and his artistic magic has graced several books.<br />Innocenti's work is extraordinary, most of it in a somber mood, with exquisite detail and sense of perspective. The people in them look wan and a little sad, and his color palette is subdued, primarily shades of brown, with slate blue and dusty rose accents. His mice are marvelous, and the piece on page 65, of two mice being captured in a cage, with his relatives bemoaning their fate, is brilliant. This is when &quot;Dame Mouselinks fled this scene of horror. Sorrow and rage filled her heart&quot;.<br />With thick semi-gloss pages, and a lovely layout with double-spaced print for easy reading, this is an interesting book for ballet enthusiasts, and fans of Innocenti's work, but might be too dark for young children, and those afflicted with musophobia (fear of mice) beware !ware !	2004-02-16

Many misunderstand it, thinking the blessings asked for are for one's own gratification, but this is not the case. The lesson of Jabez is in doing more for the Lord, as stated on pg. 54, &quot;God wants you to urgently desire a larger life with more opportunities to serve Him&quot;.<br />A well constructed and aesthetically pleasing little book, with light peachy-beige marbleized pages and dark brown easy-to-read print, reading this every morning for a month is time put to good use.

I am presently  almost at the end of my second cover-to-cover reading, and love this translation more than ever.<br />The heart and soul of this translation was the dedication and scholarship of Dr. Frances Siewert (1881-1967), a remarkable woman whose passion for the scriptures and knowledge of languages, along with the commitment of the Lockman Foundation and Zondervan Publishing House, gave us this marvelous translation, first published in one volume in 1965.<br />Among the many sources used were Rudolph Kittel's Biblia Hebraica, Wescott and Hort's Greek Text, the 23rd Edition of Nestle Greek New Testament, and Greek and Hebrew lexicons.<br />Each book has an introduction that I find extremely useful; it gives historical perspective, insights into the authorship, and more.<br />The back of the volume contains a fairly extensive concordance, several maps, and the leatherbound and hardback editions have a print size that is kind to the eyes.<br />For those like me who are &quot;non-academic&quot;, but want to understand and learn from the scriptures as much as we are capable of, I highly recommend reading this translation, at least once in a lifetime.<br />Psalm 46:1<br />Amplified: &quot;God is our Refuge and Strength (mighty and impenetrable to temptation), a very present and well-proved help in trouble&quot;.<br />KJV: &quot;God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&quot;.	2004-01-20

The pages are edged in gold, there is a ribbon marker, and the cover is bonded leather. What I especially like is the flap, that gives me just enough room to clip a pen on the inside, and goes over the cover to snap shut, protecting the pages from damage while in my purse.<br />The first Bible I ever purchased was published by Nelson, and after over twenty years of  use is still in one piece; this edition seems to be constructed with a similar level of quality, so I have high hopes for its durability.<br />I'm not a &quot;stuff and things&quot; person, but this little Bible is something I own that I truly delight in, definitely qualifying as a Top Ten purchase.	2004-01-13

This makes a good reference Bible if you do not have a NKJV translation, and want to compare passages for further understanding; the price makes it ideal for this purpose, as reading more than one version of a section that is hard to understand can be edifying.<br />My daily reading is with The Amplified Bible (which is the one used by popular author and TV preacher Joyce Meyer), and have been using the KJV for comparison. I bought this as a third translation, but the more I read it, the more I like it, and will probably upgrade this volume to one with larger print in the near future, so I am torn between recommending this as a second or third Bible, or advise buying a better quality NKJV.<br />This is called a &quot;Gift and Award&quot; Bible, but with the print being so small, it would be a mistake to give this to a young person if it is intended as their primary Bible...they will soon tire of it no matter how sharp their vision; though this translation would be ideal for that purpose, a bigger font size is definitely needed.<br />The words of Jesus are in red, and the back of the volume contains a &quot;Read Your Bible Through in a Year&quot; plan, dividing chapters in the New and Old Testaments on a daily basis; also included is a dictionary/concordance which has some line drawing illustrations, and this portion has a nice font size, and there are also two maps inside the back cover. &quot;Leather Bound&quot; means a single layer veneer, with cut edges.<br />In the final analysis, this edition is of a superb translation, but one that can be read only for a few passages at a time because of the print.<br /><br />Psalm 37:4<br />NKJV: &quot;Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He shall give you the desires of your heart&quot;.<br />KJV: &quot;Delight thyself also in the Lord; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart&quot;.<br />Amplified: &quot;Delight yourself also in the Lord, and He will give you the desires and secret petitions of your heart&quot;.	2004-01-10

Bush	Books	5	26	40	N	N	the mustard seed that grew deep roots	Carefuly researched and well written, this biography is refreshing in its unbiased, non-partisan portrait of our 43rd president. It talks about his forty years of aimless living, when he was a rowdy hard drinker and not much of a student, without condoning or condemning; his road to redemption starting in 1985, when George Bush would say Billy Graham &quot;planted a mustard seed in my soul&quot; is a fascinating &quot;prodigal son&quot; history, as is the theory (once suggested by Gail Sheehy) cited in Chapter Three, that Bush, like his hero Winston Churchill (who was also an academic disappointment, and lacking in reading skills), is an &quot;undiagnosed dyslexic&quot;. Churchill would practice his speeches for days for fear of making a mistake, and there seems to be a language disorder that makes Bush's opponents want to &quot;misunderestimate&quot; his intelligence.<br />Chapter Seven, which deals with 9/11, follows the timeline of those first agonizing days, and how we saw Bush become stronger in the midst of the turmoil, especially on the 14th, when after his powerful speech at the National Cathedral memorial service, he went to ground zero, and clambered onto a destroyed fire truck, with rescue worker and retired fireman Bill Beckwith. It was unrehearsed and unplanned, and pure Bush.<br />Also interesting and informative are the explanations in the final chapters of how we have gradually deviated from the intent of the Founding Fathers when they wrote the First Ammendment, and the reasons for the shift in policy.<br />Those who quote Bible passages and say that Christianity is not compatible with war, perhaps have not read the entire Bible; Jesus said that the time would come when we should sell our garments for a sword (Luke 22:36), and perhaps in this post 9/11 world we are in such a time.<br />The more I read about George Bush, and the more I listen and observe, the more I like, respect, and admire him, &quot;this flawed Everyman, indefinable commander in chief&quot;.ief&quot;.	2003-12-29

This thought is paraphrased again on page 98.<br />The subject of loneliness runs through the entire book, emphasizing the compassion needed towards those who have been cast aside from society; Mother Teresa speaks of loneliness being the most painful suffering: &quot;...the deepest poverty is not being loved&quot; (pg. 66).<br />Originally published as The Mother Teresa Reader, it has a lovely layout, with a lot of space to frame the thoughts, and has chapter opening quotes by Michael Collopy.<br />Though it is a book that could be read in an evening, perhaps it is better taken in small portions and given time and consideration. The level of humility and faith is deep, and deserves our attention.	2003-12-26

As an artist/illustrator, I am awed by the work that has gone into this volume, and find a great affinity with her style. The emotion she evokes in her beautiful faces is remarkable, and she uses rich colors and  graceful patterns; the perspectives are also of interest, some panoramic, seen from above, and the illustration of Jonah is pictured as a circle, as if he were caught in a whorl. Helen loves the ocean, and paints her seas with passion, and her depictions of Jesus are exquisite. My favorite picture is of Jesus and John the Baptist on page 226.<br />The satin-finish pages are thick, and the font size is large and easy on the eyes. The layout is exceptional with each page edged with a lovely design, and the illustrations are too numerous to count. The final two pages have a marvelous map of &quot;The Lands of the Bible&quot;. This book is a tremendous value, and one that will be treasured by all ages.	2003-12-19

There are many who disdain work that is embraced by \\"the common man\\", and work that is reproduced for a mass market. So be it, but I do not agree with this elitist viewpoint, and think that in many years to come, Kinkade's work will be far more valued than some of what is \\"fashionable\\" in art circles today.<br />This is a magnificent coffee table book, with thick glossy pages and excellent color reproduction, and a well written text by Rick Barnett. I pored over this volume with a magnifying glass, examining the details, the brushwork, and the evolution of Kinkade's work over the years.<br />Part I, \\"The Early Years\\": Born in 1958, Kinkade was drawing before he could walk, and his first mentor was the Bay Area artist of renown Glenn Wessels, who in 1974 moved to Thom's Placerville, California neighborhood. Later while studying at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, he painted \\"The Prince of Peace\\", which he saw in a vision, and it is a powerful piece.<br />Part II, \\"20 Years of Published Work\\":<br />\\"The Early Works, 1984-1989\\". Many of these pieces are massive scenic vistas and city street sceenes, and my one and only complaint of this book is that it does not give the dimensions of the original paintings.<br />\\"The Artist is Recognized, 1989-1993\\". On page 55, is a piece I find startling, \\"New York, Snow on Seventh Avenue, 1932\\", painted in 1989; with its extraordinary perspective, and skyscrapers bathed in the light of the setting sun, it captures the feeling of another era and there is a palpable sense of movement in it...and it is a painting I could look at for years and never tire of.<br />In 1990, during a family trip to England, the cottage paintings were born. The one that I find incredibly lovely is \\"Spring at Stonegate\\". The graceful slope of the roof, and the dappled sunlight are beautiful.<br />\\"Chasing the Horizon, 1993-1997\\". The Kinkade family moved to the South Bay area of San Francisco, and the plein air paintings took flight. My favorite of this genre is \\"Wailea Pool, Maui\\" (1996), with broad free strokes, the wind is ruffling the palm trees, and the clouds seem to be dancing.<br />There also seems to be a heightened idealism emerging during these years, which becomes even more evident in \\"The Golden Era, 1997-2000\\", where the landscapes take on a misty, eerie light. In the world of \\"Cobblestone Bridge\\" (2000), Kinkade says \\"man and nature live in God's perfect balance\\".<br />\\"Light of Freedom, 2000-2004\\". Inspired by a dream, Kinkade painted \\"The Light of Freedom\\" in 2002 as a tribute to 9/11, and from 2001, \\"San Francisco, Lombard Street\\", with an entire vista of the city, is a marvel; another treasure is \\"Desert Sunset\\" (2002), with its red sky and magical twinkling lights in the distance.<br />Motivated by his faith, and dreams and visions, Kinkade's gentle world of peace and light is sure to shine for many generations.Bay area of San Francisco, and the plein air paintings took flight.

Groberg.<br />Chapter 1, &quot;Choose&quot;, is one of the most important, as every moment of our lives we make choices, and with every choice add another brush-stroke to the portrait of our life. Here Mr. Hehn delineates the consequences of our choices, with our attitudes, habits, and relationships, and it is the latter that is illustrated with one of Larry's many clever cartoons, giving the reason we no longer have unicorns living among us.<br />Chapter 4, &quot;Commit&quot;, is also one of my favorites, with a very important point made on page 51: &quot;Often we place too much emphasis on the desired results, and not enough on the person we need to be to achieve and support those results&quot;.<br />There are many sports examples given, and how they directly relate to the &quot;game of life&quot;. Complacency and mediocrity won't win you any medals or satisfaction, on or off the playing field, and though it takes courage and determination to make these &quot;Nine Keys&quot;  work, the reward is mighty, and will lead to making the fullest use of your capabilities, and also to being a better human being.<br />More than just for adults, this would be a terrific book for a family to read and discuss together, and I highly recommend it for teenagers or for any adult who is mentoring a youngster. The language is simple enough for a young person to comprehend, and Larry tells many stories from his school days that a teen would relate to; it is never too soon to get started on the right path to success and the ethics of living a good, productive life.<br />It is never too late either, to make a commitment to excellence, and make the most of your God-given talents; this is a great motivational book, at any stage of your life.a teen would relate to; it is never too soon to get started on the right path to success and the ethics of living a good, productive life.<br />It is never too late either, to make a commitment to excellence, and make the most of your God-given talents; this is a great motivational book, at any stage of your life.	2003-12-12

Though these excerpts are not lengthy, they are simply and exquisitely written, and quite profound. Sometimes Lucado takes examples from his life, and sometimes from people of accomplishment like Leo Tolstoy, but mostly it is just good teaching, on getting a closer walk with Him, day by day.<br />The design of the book is lovely, small but with 398 pages rather weighty; it has a preface and 3 marvelous pages on reasons for choosing &quot;love, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control&quot;. Each month starts with a sepia toned photograph of trees or leaves, which is subtly reproduced on the following pages of the month. The font size is not large, but very clear and easy to read. It is an aesthetically pleasing layout and this devotional makes a perfect gift for Christmas, to keep on one's desk or prayer corner, and to be cherished for years to come.	2003-12-10

If anyone thinks this book might be about material abundance, it is not...far from it ! In fact, it shows how as part of the pruning process, one might have to let go of those possessions we &quot;hold too tightly&quot;.<br />When the Vinedresser gets out his sharp shears, it feels like tough love, but if we submit, it is a liberating love that brings us the joy of being closer to Him. Chapter 3, &quot;The Best Good News (You Didn't Want to Hear)&quot;, outlines the steps of discipline, and Chapter 4, &quot;Love by Degrees&quot;, talks about repentance, and much of the following chapters are on that daunting word, &quot;pruning&quot;.<br />&quot;Pruning is how God answers your prayers that your life will please Him more and have a greater impact for eternity&quot; (pg. 60).<br />In Chapter 5, &quot;A Country Awakening&quot;, there is a very useful chart that helps discern whether one is being disciplined or pruned; as often both can be painful, they are sometimes confused, but their purpose and consequence are quite different.<br />In Chapter 6, &quot;Flourishing Under the Shears&quot;, Dr. Wilkinson talks about how we have to submit to the tests of faith, and might have to give up things dear to you, in order to have personal transformation, and a bigger harvest for God.<br />Chapter 8, &quot;Living in the Presence&quot;, is exquisite, and gives the simple steps to the &quot;promise and practice of abiding&quot;, an abiding that brings peace and happiness to every day, no matter what the circumstances.<br />It is a well-made volume with nice quality paper, and nine line drawings of vineyard themes by Vicki Shuck that are lovely, and represent much more than vines and grapes.<br />Small but very mighty, this book is one of the most important I have read ( I have underlined so many passages, it has almost as much of my ink as print); it has been a powerful blessing in my life, and if you are looking for a &quot;breakthrough&quot; book, this may well be it.the most important I have read ( I have underlined so many passages, it has almost as much of my ink as print); it has been a powerful blessing in my life, and if you are looking for a &quot;breakthrough&quot; book, this may well be it.	2003-12-05

It also has the jacket cover and three double-page illustrations for her award winning &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1972).<br />Born in Colorado, Burkert moved to Wisconsin in her youth, where she has lived, created and exhibited her art for many years. Published in 1977, this book has a lengthy introduction by Michael Danoff, with an outline of Burkert's life and describes her technique, which is a complicated process. There are many of her pencil and brush and ink sketches in this section. It is printed on good quality paper, with a semi-gloss finish.<br />The detail in Burkert's work will keep children of all ages fascinated for many hours, and every piece has a gentle grace and spirit that is enchanting.	2003-12-04

The month of August is the longest section, and it includes a fascinating narrative of her adventurous trip to Africa. Each month is interspersed with poems, and essays on dreams, memories, and thoughts on the passing years. My favorite is \\"The Story of a Birth\\", going back to her youth and the bearing of her first child.<br />The photography is also lovely; I especially like the birds, and the rather Churchillian (as in Winston) cat on page 30.<br />Ms. Fordyce's use of language is mellifluous, and her detailed, graceful descriptions will delight many, and though this is not my usual fare (I tend to read the \\"no-frills\\" type of book), I give it a high rating; the quality is excellent, with thick, satin-finish pages, an easy to read font size, and a well designed layout. Because of its themes, it would no doubt be classified as a \\"woman's book\\", but will also be enjoyed by those who like to read about nature.	2003-12-04

It has a nice dedication page and its 30 chapters are arranged in themes, starting with &quot;Assurance&quot;, and ending with &quot;Wisdom&quot;.<br />Most chapters start with a poem or saying from selected sources, and a few of them are heartfelt, beautiful prayers by Doris Rikkers, a writer of Christian children's books, and the compiler of this lovely volume; the rest of the content consists of Bible quotes, in the NIV translation.<br />Small enough to fit in a purse, I find it handy to keep in my car for times of waiting or a peaceful coffee break, and it is also good for anyone who needs some inspiration in doing intercessory prayer for those with specific needs. Under the short but mighty chapter for &quot;Protection&quot;, there is one of my favorite verses: &quot;The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms&quot; (Deut. 33:27).<br />Considering the limits of its size, I give this a high rating in the &quot;stocking stuffer&quot; category.	2003-11-27

There is also much insight given into the many parables of Jesus, which is most helpful.<br />In Chapter # 1, &quot;Keyhole to the Stars&quot;, the first subjects mentioned are the two keys that indicate the &quot;where and how&quot; of our Final Destination; the first is belief, and the second is behavior.<br />The following five chapters deal with the behavior part, and are about the purpose of life, and how our choices and &quot;works&quot; are so important, what is meant by &quot;repayment&quot; for works done, those opportunities for good actions that we might have passed by, and much more. Also discussed are our motives, and how well we steward what God has given us.<br />Chapter 7 brings us back to the essential key of belief, and the final chapter ends with a pledge of allegiance as a &quot;citizen of heaven&quot;;  the last six pages have quotes from Christian leaders, from Augustine to John Wesley, on the subject of eternal rewards.<br />Dr. Wilkinson gives us all a challenge, &quot;...to see your true calling today and to seize the opportunity that is right in front of you.

Perhaps one of the reasons this book has not  gained as large a readership as Dr. Wilkinson's other books (another reason would be that this is a much tougher read than his others) are the words on the cover; most of us want to &quot;join the crowd&quot; rather than be &quot;set apart&quot;, and holiness seems like such a lofty, unobtainable goal, but with the help of this book both ideals become accessible.<br />The chapters in this section delineate the different stages of holiness, and the preparation of consecrating one's life to the Lord.<br />Part Two is &quot;Victory Over Temptation&quot;, with Chapter 5 giving us &quot;straightforward, commonsense communication about daily living in holiness&quot;, Chapter 7, has &quot;Anti-Temptation Tools for Victory&quot;, and Chapter 8, &quot;The World's Toughest Temptation&quot;, which is of course, lust ! It has candid teaching on intimacy in marriage that might surprise some people, and should be required reading for anyone contemplating marriage or already wed.<br />Part Three, &quot;Habits of Holiness&quot;, is empowering and life-changing.

There is also more on prayer in this chapter, giving 14 categories to concentrate on, such as Spiritual Vision, Service, and Intercession. Dr. Wilkinson recommends  that four to six categories are enough to focus on for the first year.<br />The final chapter is on &quot;Praise and Fasting&quot;, and how fervent praise and joy help us in our quest for holiness, and gives examples of different fasts that many find to be a spiritual aid.<br />It pained me to reach the end of this book, because it nourished and taught me so much; however, it has many sections that I will be using for reference, and many passages that I have underlined, that will be re-read countless times for guidance and inspiration.<br />God bless Dr. Wilkinson, who truly has encouraged me in my &quot;personal pilgrimage towards holiness&quot;.ries are enough to focus on for the first year.<br />The final chapter is on &quot;Praise and Fasting&quot;, and how fervent praise and joy help us in our quest for holiness, and gives examples of different fasts that many find to be a spiritual aid.<BR>It pained me to reach the end of this book, because it nourished and taught me so much; however, it has many sections that I will be using for reference, and many passages that I have underlined, that will be re-read countless times for guidance and inspiration. <BR>God bless Dr. Wilkinson, who truly has encouraged me in my &quot;personal pilgrimage towards holiness&quot;.	2003-11-21

It provides food for thought, in subjects that range from mundane and practical to occasionally, some of remarkable spiritual depth.<br />Much is on ethics; we are constantly making choices, some that can affect the rest of our lives, and there are some sections here that might stir us to bring our choices into sharp perspective.<br />There is a lot about taking responsibility for one's actions, and on doing the right thing ( # 636: \\"Do the right thing, regardless of what others think\\"), and on respect and kindness to humanity and the environment.<br />There are two entries, on tape recording the laughter and memories of one's parents, which is a wonderful idea, and one I wish I had done (# 248 and # 440), and much useful advice on finances, getting a job, and a lot on having a fruitful and happy marriage (# 364: \\"Every day look for some small way to improve your marriage\\").<br />Being that this was written for a young man, it is an especially good book for the male of the species, but it would make a wonderful gift for all young people starting out in life, and for those of us who are in our later years, nice reminders to keep us sharp and on the right track.	2003-10-26

It will be of particular value to those who might feel that they have lost their way in the WasteLand.<br />The first part of this book is in the form of a parable; it is as wise as it is charming, and is an almost Tolkienesque tale of Ordinary, who lived in the Land of Familiar, and who one day leaves his Usual Job, and his Comfort Zone, to persue his Dream. There are many trials and tribulations in his path, and Giants to slay (Giants like Moneyless), but his faith gets stronger, as he learns his lessons.<br />In Chapter Nine, &quot;Living Past the Edge&quot;, Mr. Wikinson describes his fear of public speaking, and the steps he took to overcome it. I recently had the good fortune to be at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California, where Mr. Wilkinson spoke not only to the vast crowd in attendance, but to millions on televison, and he is a truly gifted speaker; it is hard to envision that at one time he had felt inadequate in front of an audience. With this book he will help you conquer your own fears, and get past the feeling of being Unworthy and Unable.<br />In Chapter Twelve, he talks about the Dream that has not been surrendered to God, and the pitfalls that can bring; how &quot;Your Dream will become your idol&quot;, and how that can &quot;make people 'successful' but not fulfilled&quot; (pg. 133) and further, to face the areas in our lives that need cleansing, where we may be making compromises and have &quot;unfinished business&quot;.<br />In the final chapter, Mr. Wilkinson describes how his Dream has led him to South Africa, to help the millions of children who have lost their parents to AIDS, and it is an example of how once you have reached one Dream, it can lead to another, with God continually working through you. &quot;You are meant to be a river of blessing, not a puddle drying in the sun&quot;.<br />The layout is lovely, with small but beautiful images by Steve Gardiner, good quality paper, and a readable font size.

If you appreciate presidential history, you are guaranteed to love this book.<br />Make sure to purchase the Seventeenth Edition, which was printed in 2003, and includes our 43rd president.<br />As an added bonus, nine pages are devoted to Confederate President Jefferson Davis (term: 2-18-1861 / 4-9-1865).<br />Most presidents are given three or more pages, except for the last three, which have two apiece.<br />Each fact sheet includes when applicable:<br />Term dates<br />Party affiliation<br />Birth and zodiac sign<br />Ancestry<br />Pertinent dates for father, mother, siblings, wife, and children.<br />Education<br />Religion<br />Occupation before presidency and pre-presidential offices<br />Military service<br />Candidates for the presidential election and how many electoral votes they each received.<br />Age at inauguration<br />Administration<br />Occupation after presidency<br />Death and who was the president in office at the time of death<br />Cause of death<br />Place of burial<br />An excerpt from the Inaugural Address or other important speech..<br />There is a very brief biography, description of the photos (birthplace, adult residence, burial site, markers, etc.) and outline maps of states that show where the birth and burial places are located, as well as the actual street address when possible.<br />The black and white snapshots are captivating, even if sometimes a little fuzzy. There is something very personal about them, as if one were looking through a family photo album. Add to this the wealth of information about the sites, and the men behind them, and you have a marvelous book for history buffs. The paper is quite nice, with a matte finish and readable print. In the &quot;about the author&quot; piece,  it says Rachel hopes &quot;readers find as much enjoyment in these pages as she did in putting them together&quot;, to which I say &quot;yes !&quot;.quot;yes !&quot;.	2003-10-17

Most of the chapters alternate between Rhonda's life before deployment to Saudi Arabia, and her time in the Middle East and in captivity. It is a moving portrait of a woman who as well as being a loving mother and wife, had dedicated her life to medicine and serving her country as a flight surgeon, and it also gives civilians a glimpse into the day to day life of the military.<br />Major Cornum's eight days at the hands of her captors are a testament to the power of the human spirit. I love the chapter where alone in her cell, her body broken and bruised, she kept her spirits up by singing, from the rock songs of the '60s to her favorite, &quot;The Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;. At 5'5, and slender as a reed, Rhonda is a tower of strength. I first became familiar with her from a TV documentary on P.O.W.s, and what impressed me the most was her balance of sensitivity and personal empowerment, and honesty with herself as well as others, which can be the ultimate bravery; after seeing this film, I had to read her book.<br />One of the elements of survival is humor, and Rhonda relates some funny episodes, and the book also has a lot to say about the rapidly changing role of women in the military. It is &quot;as told to&quot; Peter Copeland, and he has done a great job; it is well written, and very hard to put down. There are many black and white photographs, which though they look like &quot;copies&quot; and are a little fuzzy, help one understand the story, and add a lot to the book. The print quality is good, with a very readable font size.<br />Rhonda is now Colonel Cornum, and presently commands the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. She is an example to us all, and I think this book should be read by every young person, as it will inspire them to aim high and succeed in every area of life.

He was the most influential choreographer of the 20th century, and his legacy is beyond measure.<br />The Foreword is written by Peter Martins, who took the leadership of the New York City Ballet when Balanchine passed this earthly plane in 1983 at the age of 79.<br />There is a wonderful photo of the two men on page 127; two profiles, one the aged master, the other, the youthful, handsome Dane, perfect danseur noble, who became Balanchine's lead male dancer during the '70s.<br />The twenty page Essay by Lincoln Kirstein I found to be totally confounding, written in a very convoluted style, and perhaps if one is a lot smarter than I am, it is understandable.<br />&quot;Two Talks with George Balanchine&quot;, by Jonathan Cott however, is very interesting. Mr. Cott's intelligent, probing questions elicit some insightful answers.<br />&quot;Three Sides of Agon&quot; by Edwin Derby is a piece on the great ballet, which was a magnificent collaboration between Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky. As a piece of music, Agon is one of my favorite Stravinsky compositions, and the stark, extraordinary choreography made this a groundbreaking ballet.<br />There is a section that describes the photographs, and then the heart of the book, the fascinating collection of images.<br />The first one is from 1904, the year of his birth, with his wet nurse.<br />Other remarkable photos are: from 1924, dancing with his first wife Tamara Geva (who said he was a mix of poet and a general); 1929, dancing with Felia Doubrovska, who was a beloved teacher of mine, and she looks exquisite here; on page 68, a lovely study of Balanchine playing the piano. He was an excellent pianist until he lost part of a finger in a lawnmower accident; 1937, with his second wife, Vera Zorina; 1948, an exotic posed photo by Irving Penn for Vogue Magazine of Mr. B. with his third wife, Maria Tallchief, and also from '48, the George Platt Lynes (who chronicled Balanchine's life) photo of a Symphony in C rehearsal with Tanaquil LeClercq (wife # 4) and Francisco Moncion; 1963, in rehearsal for Movements for Piano and Orchestra with the beautiful Diana Adams, and the terrific Jacques d'Amboise, by Martha Swope, a noted dance photographer who made many contributions to this book, and did my favorite image, of Mr. B. with his cat Mourka.<br />Published in 1984, this small book of 154 pages has 76 black and white photos, good quality paper in a matte finish, and for some of us, many memories.in a lawnmower accident; 1937, with his second wife, Vera Zorina; 1948, an exotic posed photo by Irving Penn for Vogue Magazine of Mr. B. with his third wife, Maria Tallchief, and also from '48, the George Platt Lynes (who chronicled Balanchine's life) photo of a Symphony in C rehearsal with Tanaquil LeClercq (wife # 4) and Francisco Moncion; 1963, in rehearsal for Movements for Piano and Orchestra with the beautiful Diana Adams, and the terrific Jacques d'Amboise, by Martha Swope, a noted dance photographer who made many contributions to this book, and did my favorite image, of Mr. B. with his cat Mourka.<br />Published in 1984, this small book of 154 pages has 76 black and white photos, good quality paper in a matte finish, and for some of us, many memories.	2003-09-20

As one would expect from Martha, the appearance is almost as important as the contents, with marvelous photography, and great use of vintage plates and Depression glassware<br />It is divided into seasons, and as I live in California, and primarily eat fruits and vegetables, the Spring and Summer sections are of most interest to me; they have novelties like &quot;Cool Jicama Slaw&quot; (pg. 77), which consists of julliened jicama, minced jalape&ntilde;o peppers and chopped cilantro, in a orange and lime juice dressing, and a fabulous &quot;Corn, Fava Bean and Cucumber Succotash&quot; which includes red bell pepper and white onion to make up this colorful and wholesome recipe.<br />For the colder climates, there are wonderful hearty soups and stews, roasted vegetables, and rice, quinoa, and couscous dishes. There is a lot of what Martha calls &quot;clean food&quot;, where &quot;the flavors are clear and straightforward&quot; and come from the &quot;quality of the ingredients rather than elaborate techniques&quot;.<br />There are some unique desserts, like &quot;Frozen Chai&quot; (pg. 126), which can be made without an ice cream maker, using a food processor instead, and a &quot;Ros&eacute; Gelatin with Blackberries&quot;, which I have not tried but looks lovely. Some of the desserts, like the rich chocolate sorbet pictured on page 193,  are served in teacups with saucers, making an attractive table setting.<br />This is a beautiful book to look at, and it is full of ideas on how to add interest to a health-conscious diet, with simplicity, and a lot of flavor.	2003-09-09

It is sometimes jarring, and that is its beauty. It will smash your sacred cows and make you think, so if you are constrained by political correctness, you may not appreciate Mr. Zubry's sharp insights and acerbic humor. And what humor ! Since most of my reading is done at an open air caf&eacute;, I must have appeared to be a jolly sort to passersby with my loud and hearty mirth while reading this book, but in fact, I rarely read or see much that I find genuinely funny, so Mr. Zubry's earthy, outrageous wit was a welcome change, and so good for the soul.<br />A collection of essays, poems, and a final chapter entitled &quot;Prosaic Thoughts&quot;, much has been taken from Mr. Zubry's adventurous life, and the sometimes bizarre events that have been a part of that journey. I relish the unique and unconventional satirical pieces, like &quot;Manifest: A secret conspiracy of the Bony People to take over the world and destroy tomatoes&quot; in which he inserts nuggets of wisdom like: &quot;Truth is demanding. Truth requires sacrifice from the ones who want to know it&quot; (pg. 101), and most hilarious of all is &quot;SGS &amp; S Co. Kettle&quot;, which is a take-off on those many manuals that now accompany most products we buy.<br />Born in the Soviet Union, his world travels have given him a unique perspective, and now, after many years of living in the U.S., shares his views of life in America; he has a sharp sense of the ludicrous, and few subjects escape his whetted pen.<br />If you can see the comedic side of the passing parade of humanity, without objection to ideas that may not agree with yours, this is a book that will make you reflect, might open some horizons, and you are guaranteed some hearty guffaws.<br />&quot;The road of life is not long but surely wide and bumpy&quot; (pg. 246), so why not have a big laugh along the way with this book as your companion.	2003-08-28

There are some choice photographs that include one of his companion of many years, Emile Floger, and her beauty was no doubt the model for many of his mythical pieces, as in his Judith I, and there is the well-known portrait of her shown, in lovely shades of blue, on page 45.<br />The reproductions are wonderful, with excellent color, on fine glossy paper. Many are details, where one can see his brush strokes, and though he is primarily known for his figuratives, several are of his landscapes. The final plates are of works from 1917-1918 that are unfinished, but still magical. For those who have seen his work in person, or remember the scene from the film &quot;Wings of the Dove&quot; that takes place at a Klimt exhibit, know that his paintings are large and spectacular, and the good quality printing in this book gives one a taste of the majesty of his work.<br />As any artist with a singular vision and a dedication to their art will echo, Klimt is quoted as saying &quot;Whoever wants to know about me...should study my pictures with care&quot;, and Klimt's paintings speak volumes for this complex man, who loved women and nature, and painted both so well.	2003-08-25

As one turns the pages, one enters the world of a true master, an artist who puts his entire being into each painting.<br />Born in 1946 with a lineage of extraordinary painters, Jamie has a familial style, but his work has has a personality that is all his own. The book is categorized into six themes, each with its own special magic.<br />&quot;Sitters&quot;: In this chapter, it states &quot;Jamie does not paint a portrait as much as he lives it&quot;, and notes how he spends months studying his subject before the final masterpiece emerges on canvas. Perhaps his most famous painting is the portrait of John F. Kennedy, which he did after watching hundreds of hours of film of the late president. His astonishing likeness of Lincoln Kirstein is backview, with a quarter view of Kirstein's face. Four pages are devoted to Rudolph Nureyev, who many decades ago would take the same dance class with me, and would inspire me with his dedication and intensity. These pictures, especially the &quot;Study # 25&quot;, capture the passion and determination I remember in this great dancer, better than any photograph I have seen.<br />&quot;Shapes&quot;: Chairs, haystacks, and pipes; taking simple objects, and revealing the beauty within them.<br />&quot;Pigs and Things&quot;: Wonderful images of pigs, barnyards, an exquisite horse, a stupendous little dog.<br />&quot;The Deep Gorge&quot;: A close-up look into a forest, brought to life with Jamie's unique vision.

It would be interesting for someone with a large family to prepare this from the Apple Salad to the Mincemeat and Custard Cornbread.<br />The paper quality is good, with a semi-matte finish, and the photographs by Alexandra Avakian capture the atmosphere and beauty of the rural locations, the houses, the creative and colorful quilts, and the people; the children are exquisite, and look so healthy.<br />This book represents a wonderful piece of Americana and a basic part of our heritage; it is lovely to look at, a pleasure to read, and full of wholesome, nutritious and delicious recipes to treasure for generations.	2003-08-24

Standouts include the gorgeous Damask stockings, made from vintage fabrics, the wonderful fruit wreath in warm pastels, and my favorite, the &quot;Ladies dancing and lords a-leaping&quot; strung across the fireplace.<br />The recipes are sumptuous and shown in elegant settings, and very special is the sheet music that has the look of antique reproductions, of many familiar carols.<br />In the back of the volume there are templates for the many craft objects in the book, making the construction of them simpler, though you will obviously need a scanner and printer if you want to vary the size of the items, and many look like one would want to enlarge them.<br />As one would expect from Martha, the photography and layout is excellent, with thick, glossy pages.

Gage. The paper is thick, and with a matte finish. Though there are books on this subject that are more eye-catching on the market, those who have a keen interest the marvelous arts and crafts of Mexico will appreciate it.	2003-07-29

The photos depict many types, from the &quot;mutt&quot; variety to pure bred, and you are sure to find one that looks just like your beloved fur friend. The adorably plump shorthair tricolor playing with a squirrel, on page 17, looks exactly like my buddy Liddy !<br />It has a nice layout for such a small book, and good quality glossy paper; it would make a fine stocking-stuffer for the Holidays, and as Leonardo da Vinci said, &quot;The smallest feline is a masterpiece&quot;.	2003-07-18

Also fascinating are the glimpses into the lives of the powerful and famous, like J.Paul Getty, Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson, Leonid Brezhnev, and many more.<br /><br />The early chapters will be interesting for those who like me, live in Southern California, as a snapshot of what life was like in the first half of the 20th century; the descriptions  show how much it has changed, and it is also significant to take note of  the growth of our government since the days when Nixon was vice president in the '50s. The recounting of the violence and unrest of the '60s in the middle chapters vividly brings to life that troubled time, which we tend to gloss over and forget. There is much history in this book, that provides a good perspective to the world conditions of the present era.<br />Mrs. Eisenhower does not shy away from the downward spiral of the Watergate crisis, and is very blunt about how it affected her family; she truly does tell us \\"The Untold Story,\\" and lays out many facts, succinctly and with candor. Written in 1986, it has many marvelous photographs, and clear, readable print. The editing is terrific; there are no dull passages, and no awkward phrases. I am in the habit of giving books away once read, but this is one I will keep.<br /><br />Mrs. Nixon passed on the 22nd of June, 1993, exactly ten months before her husband. They both rest side by side,  surrounded by aromatic roses, blue agapanthas, and the sound of birdsongs, in the garden of the extraordinary Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, California. The peace and beauty of this memorial site is overwhelming, and so fitting for this courageous, loving woman.with candor.

Originally published as a limited edition in France, in 1925, it has been translated from the French by Jessie Wood, with good reproductions of the brightly colored illustrations, which resemble illuminated manuscripts, and have much intricate detail.<br />It also includes a lengthy introduction by the noted dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who gives an overview of Pushkin's life, and his influence on the ballet, with many stories that became the basis for works performed by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes (like \\"The Golden Cockerel\\", or as it is better known, \\"Le Coq d'Or\\"), and of course opera, with the likes of Eugene Onegin, and Boris Godunov.<br />The first story is \\"The Golden Cockerel\\", about a magical creature who is given to the Tsar for protection, but has dire consequences; # 2 is \\"The Tale of the Tsar Sultan\\", and is the longest of the stories, about a simple peasant girl who marries the Tsar, her jealous relatives, and her hero son, who saves the life of a swan that later turns into a princess. # 3 is \\"The Dead Princess and the Seven Heros\\", which one will recognize as a version of \\"Snow White\\", and # 4 is \\"The Tale of the Golden Fish\\", about a man with an avaricious wife, and the fish that grants him many favors.<br />These stories all have a moral to them, and the evil ones get their dues; it is also written in a style that would take some maturity, so this would be recommended for a child old enough to appreciate Pushkin's language, and the complexity of Zvorykin's art.	2003-05-21

Even though this book has between its covers only 1% of the museum's gigantic collection, it has a dazzling assortment of work for those interested in art made in the U.S.A.<br />The Introduction is written by William Kloss, and has a history of the museum, with its many building revisions, now housed in the heart of downtown Washington, D.C.<br />Divided into 9 &quot;themes&quot;, it starts with &quot;Early America&quot;, with the work of John Singleton Copley (1738-1815). There is a quote from the artist, his portrait of Mrs. George Watson, and an explanation of the piece by contributor Richard Murray of the National Museum. Most of the artists/works displayed follow this format throughout the book. This first chapter also includes work by John James Audubon, Thomas Moran, and some of the remarkable artists who depicted American Indian culture, like George Catlin.<br />Chapter 2 is &quot;Tradition&quot;, which includes two of my favorite artists, Albert Pinkham Ryder, with his magical, visionary paintings, and the mastery of Winslow Homer.<br />Chapter 3: &quot;20th Century Life&quot;, starts with Maurice Prendegast, has a section of Southwestern art, &quot;Urban Views&quot;, and &quot;The New Deal&quot;. 5 pieces by William H. Johnson, brilliantly depicting African-American imagery, are the centerpiece of this chapter, which also includes the work of several photographers.<br />Chapter 4, &quot;People&quot;, spans many centuries, with portraits ranging from Charles Wilson Peale's &quot;Mrs. James Smith and Grandson&quot;, to Chicano artist Jesse Trevi&ntilde;o's &quot;Mis Hermanos&quot;.<br />Chapter 5: &quot;Spirit and Religion&quot;, is a short chapter that includes a stunning Andrew Wyeth piece, &quot;Dodge's Ridge&quot;, that I have not seen published elsewhere.<br />Chapter 6 is &quot;Folk Art&quot;, whimsical, brilliant work by &quot;untrained artists&quot;. The museum started to incorporate these pieces into their inventory in 1986, adding a marvelous dimension to their collection.<br />Chapter 7: &quot;Modern Art&quot;, starts with the sumptuous Max Webber &quot;Summer&quot;, and ends with the sculpture of Bryan Hunt.<br />Chapter 8: &quot;Craft Objects&quot;, includes an array of glass, wood, fiber, and mixed media, some of them useful, like George Nakashima's beautiful walnut and hickory &quot;Conoid Bench&quot;.<br />Chapter 9: &quot;Contemporary Voices&quot;, starting with the cover piece, Luis Jimenez's vibrant sculpture &quot;Vaquero&quot;, has a wide variety of styles and media, reflecting the art of the last three decades.<br />Though there are some notable omissions (Jackson Pollock, Milton Avery, and Mark Rothko come to mind), this is an excellent overview of some of America's greatest artists, with good color reproduction, and thick glossy pages, and truly does &quot;delight the reader's eye&quot;.'s Ridge&quot;, that I have not seen published elsewhere. <BR>Chapter 6 is &quot;Folk Art&quot;, whimsical, brilliant work by &quot;untrained artists&quot;.

Whether he imagines himself as an insect making a journey &quot;from your hips to your feet&quot;, traveling to distant places with his beloved by his side, or as a soldier who must leave but whose love will &quot;go on singing until the end of life&quot;, Neruda writes with exquisite simplicity, and great beauty.<br /><br />I find this to be the most accessible of Neruda's books that I have read, perhaps because its subject was a central part of his life. As explained in the introduction of the book, these poems are autobiographical, and written about his wife, Matilde Urrutia. First published anonymously in 1952, they were released in 1963 under his own name, but only after much thought, because of their &quot;intimate birth&quot;.<br />The translations by Donald D. Walsh are superb. He has captured the fluid rhythm, the emotion, and the fire.<br />He was fortunate to have had this remarkable relationship, as well as the ability to express his feelings with such uncommon depth, but for those men who lack Neruda's poetic genius, and who would like to melt the heart of the woman they love, this might be the perfect gift to go along with that bunch of flowers.	2003-04-12

He says he uses the verb \\"suffer\\", because he cannot find one that is more adequate. These tales are about life in Buenos Aires, a beautiful city in a country of abundant resources, that has been broken by decades of repression, corruption, and murderous regimes.<br />It is in 3 parts: 1. \\"De la violencia en la vida cotidiana\\", which has 6 stories, 2. \\"Del amor en la guerra cotidiana\\" (4 stories), 3. \\"La magia en la rutina cotidiana\\" (3 stories). The longest is 18 pages, the shortest 2 pages, and all of them are immediate, tragic without ever being dreary, and once started, hard to put down.<br />Gudi&ntilde;o Kieffer is one of my favorite authors, and perhaps the reason he has not been translated into English and gained a wider audience is because his work is so distinctly Argentine, using unique and colorful slang and inflection, so that though the story could be told, the flavor would be lost; the singular flavor of Buenos Aires, that in these \\"cuentos\\" comes to life with all the author's love and despair for his country, using his pen as a sword. \\"Uno no siempre hace lo que quiere. A veces lo que puede. Y a dura pena\\".	2003-04-04

The longest of the histories is on Catherine de Medici, with all its fascinating intrigue, and my favorite is the chapter on Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-1492), which also includes the short life of his brother Giuliano (1453-1478).<br />This has been a cherished book since childhood, when I loved it for its black and white illustrations; most of them are sublime portraits by artists like Bronzino and Raphael, and I fell in love with Botticelli's rendition of the above-mentioned Giuliano,  mesmerized by the beauty of this painting (Plate VI). Michelangelo  sculpted Giuliano for his tomb (Plate XXV), posed gracefully seated, wearing a breastplate, and also used his likeness for the famous statue of David. There is a difference in how Giuliano is represented by these two masters, but historians have noted that Michelangelo's interpretation is most like its subject.<br />It has copious notes, a wonderful fold-out Genealogical Tree, and a list of Authorities Consulted. For anyone interested in this era of history and the extraordinary Medici family, this book, though written many decades ago, tells its story in a fluid and riveting style, and is great reading.	2003-03-27

Bill Watterson's creation of Calvin and Hobbes is for my taste the ultimate adult comic strip; six year old Calvin, his stuffed tiger Hobbes, and his extensive and witty vocabulary, can be laugh-out-loud hilarious.<br />In this large, softcover book, you get all the usual suspects: The dreaded Miss Wormwood, Calvin's schoolteacher, who has to put up with his imaginitive but lame excuses, snowball fights with Susie, Spaceman Spiff, who gets stranded on distant planets, and of course, his stressed out parents.<br />Other characters include two marvelous one-eyed aliens, Galaxoid and Nebular, who buy the earth from Calvin for 50 leaves, but when it snows, claim they were overcharged, and demand that Calvin bring the planet up to code, and Calvin's musings on whether there is an Evil Santa, who gives to the bad girls and boys \\"the dangerous, annoying, and corrupting toys your parents won't allow\\", and best of all, when he decides to be a Suburban Post-Modernist artist, and claims that \\"art isn't about ideas, it's about style\\".<br />Hobbes is my favorite cartoon animal, drawn as a stuffed toy when seen from non-Calvin eyes, but a wise and playfull being in Calvin's magical world. There's a lot of love between them, and the hug on the back cover of this book says it all. Calvin and Hobbes will appeal to the rebel in us all, provide numerous laughs, and warm our hearts on cold days.	2003-03-18

It is also educational, with a clear and well written text by Philomon Sturges.<br />There is a short explanation of the great religions of the world: Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and 26 descriptions of the places depicted. A useful world map is on the final page, so one can see exactly where these Sacred Places are.<br />I have had the privilege of seeing Mr. Laroche's work in a gallery setting, and marveled at its intricacy and inventiveness; his skill in using paper as an art medium is unparalleled (he calls his technique \\"paper relief\\"), and as I  work with similar tools as a collage artist, I am in awe of his mastery.<br />The reproductions in this book are excellent, with good color (the tiles of the Dome of the Rock are gorgeous !), and Mr. Laroche's sense of perspective is also wonderful; I found the overview of the Kaaba spectacular and startling, as I never envisioned it as being in the midst of a city. The large vista of Jerusalem is also fabulous, but so are the smaller, simpler pieces, like the Wailing Wall and the Church of Agios Ioannis Theologos, which are two of my favorites.<br />Children of all ages will be enchanted with this book, for its instructive content, and its whimsical, exquisite art.	2003-03-15

In a very real sense, he is a painter, as he writes in a way that gives one a clear visual image of the locale and people who are a part of his stories; stories that come from a life of much travel, and a razor sharp view of the many twists and turns that living a life fearlessly, and open to its many risks, can provide.<br />He writes in a relaxed, conversational style, as if he was sitting at your kitchen table over a cup of coffee. Though this type of book is not my normal reading fare, I found it to be fascinating, and for the most part, very moving.<br />One of the most affecting of these tales is \\"Jewish Blood\\", about a young man of Jewish descent who is part of Hitler's invasion of Poland; it is poignant and tragic, and very memorable.<br />Unfortunately, the editor did a poor job of proofreading, and some of the stories are replete with typos, though it does not take away from the impact of the work, and hopefully, future editions will find this corrected.<br />Mr. Zubry starts each story with a poem, and even the acknowledgments are delightful and in rhyme; the volume is further enhanced by the simple yet extremely appealing illustrations of Zhanna Safro.<br />Another thing that makes me appreciate this book is Mr. Zubry's feeling for animals. Especially cats ! A man who likes cats has to have a little spot in his heart that is solid gold.	2003-02-15

The 150 posters included in this book came from the Agrasanchez Film Archive in Harlingen, Texas, which houses a vast private collection of approximately 2,000 posters, as well as 1,400 Mexican films, and much more.<br />Included in this book is an extensive history of this period of Mexican film, a bibliography, and short bios of some of the artists, although a few posters are not credited, and some of the artists that are credited have no biographical material.<br />The heart of the book is the artwork, which is colorful, humorous, and dramatic. The women are extremely curvaceous (some scantily clad, and on two occasions with nothing at all), and many of the men, like Jorge Negrete in &quot;El Fanfarron&quot;, looking dashing and &quot;muy macho&quot;.<br />It is divided into categories: 1: Comedy, 2: Cabaret Girls, 3: Cowboys and Folklore, 4: History and Religion, 5: Drama, and 6: Mystery and Adventure.<br />My favorite is &quot;Vuelven Los Garcia&quot;, by Juanino Renan Berenguer, with horses and riders in silhouette, against a magnificent sky, and two others painted by Juanino's brother Josep,  &quot;Cartas Marcadas&quot; with Pedro Infante and Marga Lopez, and Libertad Lamarque in &quot;Soledad&quot;; both show portraiture with a hint of cubism, and are quite remarkable.<br />Also recommended is the lovely set of 40 postcards, selected from this book, in an attractive, sturdy gift box. the cards are on a matte finish stock, and the plates of this book have a semi-gloss finish. Both will be appreciated by fans of Mexican film, and anyone who enjoys popular art forms.lovely set of 40 postcards, selected from this book, in an attractive, sturdy gift box. the cards are on a matte finish stock, and the plates of this book have a semi-gloss finish.

Among the others are Scottish-born John Kane (1860-1934) with his solemn figuratives, Edgar Alexander McKillop (1879-1950) with his whimsical sculptures in black walnut wood, the great Russian-born Morris Hirshfield (1872-1946) with his unusual female figures and lionine cats, the immensely popular Grandma Moses (1860-1961), the incredible wood carvings of Elijah Pierce (1892-1984), intricate mixed media on paper from Mexican-born Martin Ramirez (1895-1963), whose &quot;Untitled&quot; frontispiece for this book is terrific, the mystical mixed media work of Sister Gertrude Morgan (1900-1980), and the youngest artist included is Ken Grimes (b. 1947) who works with white lettering/designs on a black background.<br /> Perhaps my favorites are Horace Pippin (1888-1946), who is surely one of the greatest of African-American artists, and Joseph Yoakum (1890-1972) with his graceful, delicate drawings.<br />Each artist represented has an extensive biography, with examples of their work. This is a weighty volume with glossy pages and 140 full-color plates.

The way his work is an integral part of its surroundings is pure genius. The photograph on page 118 of the famous Fallingwater House, with the waterfall seeming to come from the structure is a perfect example of this.<br />The architect is quoted as saying &quot;Nature is all the body of God we will ever know&quot; (pg.26), and his creations reflect this reverence for the landscape.<br />Part Two is profusely illustrated in black and white and color, with only explanatory text. As magnificent as these photographs are, what I find the most thrilling are the drawings. They are reproduced in color, many are yellowed, torn and with little adhesive tape marks, but are of astounding beauty, and a glimpse into the mind of this unique and brilliant man.<br />Mr. Pfeiffer became Frank Lloyd Wright's student in the Taliesin Fellowship, and is the director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Archives in Scottsdale, Arizona. This is one of numerous books he has written on Wright's life and work, and it is a fitting tribute to one of America's creative giants.	2003-01-03

They both have  much knowledge on this subject, and with the exception of a typo on page 149 (reversed captions on photos), have given those of us who love and respect our four pawed friends a winner with this volume.	2002-12-30

His designs have a stark simplicity, with natural surfaces. His favorite material is concrete, and its weight contrasts with the brightness of his interior spaces. A disciple of Le Corbusier, like his teacher, he believes that &quot;Interiors exist only when they are flooded with light&quot;.<br />Born in 1926, his paintings and architectural pieces have had numerous exhibits, and he has won many prestigious awards.<br />Published in 1998, this large soft cover book has a preface by Gonzalez de Leon, a long introduction by Mario A. Arnaboldi, and a detailed explanation that accompanies the many color photos, floor plans, and cross sections of the works.<br />There are 16 buildings shown, with photos from many angles. Four of these have not been constructed, and are shown in model form. Two of my favorites are in Mexico City; the Fondo de Cultura Economica, with a bridge that spans and floats between the structures and extends beyond them, and the vast Arcos Bosques Corporativo, which is featured on the cover, and has the eerie suspension in the upper floors.	2002-12-21

It describes how the palaces and churches were built, the materials used, and  how its famous glass making was developed.<br />It has classified the arts of Venice into four categories:<br />&quot;Solid&quot; (stone, tiles, wellheads and chimneys).<br />&quot;Ductile&quot; or &quot;Malleable&quot; (wood and metals).<br />&quot;Fragile&quot; (glass, ceramics, stucco).<br />&quot;Soft&quot; (silk, tapestries, lace, embroidery, leather).<br />This is a wonderful book to read and learn from, but it is the work of Mark E. Smith, who with few exceptions did most of the photography, that makes it so spectacular. His close-up views of marble and wood inlays, ornate jewelry, brocades and laces, often in 2 page spreads, are breathtaking.<br />An all-color, profusely illustrated book, it will educate as well as delight the eye with its luxurious beauty.	2002-12-19

She also has much to say about the pandering of the &quot;Helpists&quot;, &quot;personality over character&quot;, her aversion to children, and more.<br />Being one myself, I thoroughly enjoyed Chapter 4, &quot;Spinsterhood is Powerful&quot;.  She says in this chapter: &quot;I am often accused of being an anti-feminist, and my name is mud at Ms. Magazine, but in truth my whole life has been a feminist statement. The conflict lies not in my outlook and attitudes but in the definition of feminism that has been foisted on America in the late twentieth century&quot;.<br />Chapter 16, about her foray into the lusty romance novel genre (which she wrote under the pseudonym of Laura Buchanan) is hilarious, as are her efforts to write a magazine piece on the work of John Updike.<br />This collection of 18 essays was originally published in '89, and is a good example of her cynical but humorous viewpoint.  Though dreadfully missed as a contributor to National Review Magazine, where she has recently taken her leave (her &quot;Misanthrope's Corner&quot; had graced the back page for decades), her books will continue to delight me, in their uniqueness and passionate spirit of independence.	2002-12-06

Born in 1401 at San Giovanni Valdarno, Masaccio moved to Florence when he was 16, and by 19 was already becoming known for his painting.<br />His first surviving known painting, from 1422, the San Giovenale Triptych, is shown as a whole, and in detail. The harmony between the figures, and the glorious colors, make this a spectacular Madonna and Child, flanked on each side by two saints and an angel.<br />Masaccio worked with Masolino and Filippino Lippi on the frescoes from the Brancacci Chapel, and the work of all three artists is shown in this book.<br />My favorite piece is part of the Pisa Polyptych, the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;. The delicacy and loveliness of the composition, especially the expressive beauty of the four horses, make this a piece for all to admire and for art students to study.<br />There is an emotional intensity in his figuratives; in the &quot;Expulsion from the Garden of Eden&quot; one can see Adam and Eve's agony and shame on their faces, and his Jesus in &quot;Tribute Money&quot; is strong and manly.<br />Masaccio died at the young age of 27, in Rome, as he had just started the Santa Maria Magiore Polyptych; the fresco was finished by his former collaborator, Masolino, and is the final full sized plate in the book.<br />Well written and researched (with many quotes from Vasari) by Ornella Casazza, this 1997 edition, printed in Italy on thick, glossy paper, has 35 full sized richly colored plates, and many more smaller ones. Great for Masaccio fans, and lovers of this magnificent era of Italian art.	2002-12-01

It's the cell starvation that results from years of ingesting processed and cooked foods&quot; (pg.42).<br />The causes and cures for many diseases are discussed, as well as depression and alcoholism, and the &quot;Mind/Body Connection&quot;.<br />There are numerous food lists, and show how to combine foods for the best nutritional results and ease of digestion.<br />Under &quot;Shopping for Recreational Foods&quot;, some cooked food is listed, so one can have a little &quot;fun with food&quot; from time to time.<br />There's a chapter on sprouts, and how to germinate them, and the value of doing so, as well as over 50 pages of recipes.

It will tell you how to deal with the stressful situations in a cat's life, like moving, travel, and the introduction of a new pet into the family.<br />Being a &quot;cat person&quot;, I much appreciate the care and research that went into this book.

The reproductions in this book are printed on good quality, glossy paper, with intense and rich hues. There are over 100 color reproductions, many of them in detail.<br />Because Duccio was rebellious, hot-headed, and mismanaged his money, more is known about him than other artists of his era, thanks to the many fines he was given that were recorded...but the town authorities who gave him the fines, were sometimes the same ones to give him commissions. It's presumed that he was born between 1255 and 1260, and died in late 1318 or in the early part of 1319.<br />His tender and majestic Madonna and Child panels are inspiring and of incredible beauty. The large \\"Madonna and Child Enthroned with Angels and Saints\\", which is the main panel from his \\"Maesta\\", is extraordinary in its symmetry, and its perfection, from the exquisite feet of the Christ Child, to each fold of embroidered cloth.<br />It's interesting to compare the \\"Annunciation\\" (pg. 26), with the \\"Announcement of Death\\" (pg. 74). Both with a strong angel, and a serene, all-knowing Mary.<br />Another glorious piece is \\"Entry into Jerusalem\\", from the \\"Stories of the Passion\\" panels. The composition, with its flowing lines, is Duccio at his most sublime.<br />Well written and extensively researched by Cecilia Jannella, this 1991 book is a treasure for anyone who loves the work of this Sienese master.	2002-10-06

It gives a tremendous amount of information on both these items, their many different types, and how to cook them to perfection.<br />The &quot;Dal-Based Dishes&quot; is a superb chapter, and one can even &quot;mix and match&quot; these recipes and come up with a delightful side dish.<br />Other good chapters are &quot;Snacks&quot; (oh ! those heavenly samosas !), and the many pages of veggie recipes...you'll also get a lot of info on spices and ingredients.<br />Most of the spices and ingredients are available in any good supermarket, although if you're lucky to live in an area with an Indian market, you'll find the same items, usually for a fraction of the cost.<br />I have the 1972 hardcover edition to this book, and though the chapters have been moved about, the contents in this edition are almost the same. With all my many moves, I don't have a lot of cookbooks, but this one will always be a keeper.	2002-10-03

The analogy of the ketchup packet is priceless, and I was very moved by the final chapter.<br />I'm giving this the highest rating, because I think Mr. Gividen succeeded nicely in his goals with this book, and I hope it reaches a large audience.<br />I'd highly recommend it as a family book to read and discuss together...it would make a great teaching tool, and though it helps to be familiar with the Bible, and have one handy for the notes at the end of each chapter, Christians and non-Christians alike can benefit and learn from Hannah's example, as it expresses universal truths.	2002-09-16

There is a mini bio of Botticelli, a 3 page introduction, and little more than 3 pages of &quot;An outline of the artist's critical history&quot;, with quotes dating back to c.1485 through 1965.<br />The large dimensions of the book allows for a special treat: details in the actual size, as in plate VI, a detail from &quot;The Adoration of the Magi&quot; that is extraordinarily lovely and gentle, and the final plate, of two angels embracing from &quot;The Mystical Nativity&quot; is perfection in it's simplicity and mastery of line.<br />On page 85, you get &quot;The Works&quot;. It includes and outline biography, and a complete catalogue of works, with dimensions, and symbol indicators for technique, support, whereabouts, etc. Each piece has a b&amp;w photo (3 x 2 or larger) of the picture and it's full history.<br />One of my two favorite works of art on this earth (the other being Rublev's &quot;Trinity&quot;), is the Botticelli's portrait of Giuliano de' Medici that hangs in the Staatliche Museen in Berlin. There are four versions of this portrait, including a gorgeous one from a private collection shown here I had not seen before...and each piece is compared as to age and execution.<br />On page 113, are &quot;Botticelli's other artistic activities&quot;, which include small reproductions of exquisite drawings, among them illustrations of Dante's &quot;Inferno&quot;. On the last two pages are door panels, inlay figures, and an embroidered cope cover.<br />One of the most unique visionaries in the history of art, Botticelli's magnificent, tranquil masterpieces are well showcased in this wonderful volume.	2002-09-13

There is a &quot;basic doll&quot;, who unfortunately looks a bit more like Barbie's Ken than Valentino, with Ken's &quot;perfect physique&quot;, and large &quot;manly jaw&quot;.<br />It has 21 costumes, mostly from his films, and also features some of his co-stars: Beatice Domingues dancing with him in &quot;The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;, Nazimova (&quot;Camille&quot;), Agnes Ayres (&quot;The Sheik&quot;), Gloria Swanson (&quot;Beyond the Rocks&quot;), Nita Naldi (&quot;Blood and Sand&quot;), Wanda Hawley (&quot;The Young Rajah&quot;), Bebe Daniels (&quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;), Louise Dresser (&quot;The Eagle&quot;), Vilma Banky (&quot;Son of the Sheik&quot;), and his wife Natasha Rambova, dressed for the dance tour they did together.<br />Rambova had much to do with some of his costumes, as she was &quot;artistic supervisor&quot; for many of his films. She hired Broadway designer Adrian for &quot;Monsieur Beaucaire&quot;, and he continued with a long and successful Hollywood career, doing designs for Valentino, and many others.<br />This is a curious piece of Valentino trivia for fans of the great silent film star...I'm giving it a fairly low rating because of it not looking more like Valentino...but if you don't mind him being &quot;Ken the Sheik of Araby&quot;, you'll find it amusing.	2002-09-12

There are four pages of excerpts from the writings of Dr. Catherine Roberts that are remarkable in their insight, and it's a section that should not be missed.<br />Animal rights is the subject closest and dearest to my heart, as I believe in the equality of all creatures, and appreciate the collected wisdom of this book.	2002-08-31

This live performance recorded at the Mencken Concert Hall in New York City is extraordinary.<br />Laurence Houseman (1865-1959), was a prolific writer and wrote several plays centered around Queen Victoria. This is an adaptation of two of them, &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot; (1933), and &quot;Victoria Regina&quot; (1934), and it also includes private and public writings of the queen and her prince consort.<br />Queen Victoria was a strong, temperamental character, and few men could have withstood being her consort with as much grace as Prince Albert. Being a sober and temperate man, he was a good balance for her, and of course, it was a rare and wonderful affection that flowed between them for 22 years.<br />The incredible wit in these readings will have you howling with laughter. One of the funnier parts concerns her dislike for small children. Albert was a much better &quot;mother&quot; to their nine offspring, and her descriptions of an infant are hilarious !<br />Julie Harris and Richard Kiley are totally brilliant. I can't imagine a more perfect performance, capturing all the love, humor, and strength of these two remarkable, complex people who changed the course of history.<br />I've always been fascinated by Victoria and Albert...I feel there is much more substance to them than what seems to be the current &quot;fashionable&quot; opinion, and for anyone who shares that interest, this tape is an absolute must to listen to.	2002-08-28

Though there's much beauty in the photographs, the book highlights the insanity of war, and the psychological damage done to its soldiers.<br />The translation may on occasion not be \\"perfect English\\", but I thought the writing was poignant and expressive.

To achieve it, we asked our children to paint or write about their Hawaii; what they understand about how Hawaii came to be&quot;. Compiled from more than six thousand entries, it's a warm and wonderful selection of stories, drawings and paintings.<br />The images are fresh and imaginitive, starting with a blazing pink and orange sun over a turbulent ocean...&quot;In the middle of the Pacific Ocean there was nothing. Hawaiian people were not born yet. If we were born, what would we stand on ?&quot;.<br />There are two fabulous paintings depicting the volcanic activity that was the beginning of the islands, describes how they became populated, its kings and queens, the missionaries, etc. In the last chapter, there is a rather gloomy prediction of &quot;what Hawaii will be like&quot; (in 2000), with highways, bridges, and &quot;super canoes&quot;.<br />There are two pages that list the names of the 253 children who contributed to this book, but the individual pictures and stories are not credited. Published nearly 30 years ago, it makes one wonder what happened to these creative children, and if they are still expressing themselves with as much color, wit, and sincerity.	2002-07-06

From Achatius to Zeno of Venice, it lists 300 saints and will give you information on their lives, the Feast-day, the legends, patronage, places of pilgrimage, and their representations in art.<br />On the minus side, there is no index, and the many black and white illustrations are not given credit, which on occasion, makes it hard to tell which saint they represent...but these are small quibbles when the rest of the book is so fine. The 82 color illustrations are gathered by theme (&quot;The Virgin Mary and the archangels&quot;, &quot;The Apostles&quot;, etc.), and are listed. My favorite is one I've not seen before, &quot;Translation of the Bones of St. Mark to Venice&quot; by Paolo Veneziano.<br />The book jacket states that the author, Clemens Joeckle, has studied both theology and art history, and says in his foreword that he has included all the saints in the 1969 Roman-Catholic General Calendar, as well as a number of others from the calendars of regional churches, and in a few rare cases, some that have been removed from official calendars, like St. Christopher, who is greatly venerated as a helper in time of need.<br />This is a lovely, informative book that I have not only enjoyed, but as an artist doing religious themes from time to time, found very useful.	2002-06-14

A great companion book for the Callanetics video tapes, it will give you a little background on Callan, and how she created her unique method of exercise.<br />The photos are astounding. Chapter 4, &quot;Portfolio of Proof&quot;, has untouched back and profile views of bikini clad women, as well a two men, as they progress from class to class. There is a sequence of photos from the 1st to the 19th class on one woman that shows an amazing transformation.<br />There is a smoothness to the body toning. Think Cyd Charisse, not Martina Navratilova. If you want that &quot;super athlete&quot; look, Callanetics is not for you. There is no bulk in the results, no accentuated muscles...just a longer, leaner line.<br />The book takes you through the entire 1-hour program, demonstrated by Callan's students. Chapter 16 is &quot;The 15 Minute Maintenance Plan&quot;, and there are chapters on &quot;Taking Care of Your Back&quot;, &quot;You're Never Too Old to Have a Fabulous Body&quot;, and more.<br />The final chapter is &quot;The Advanced Program&quot;, and it's demonstrated by Callan, with her remarkable strength, flexibility, and grace. The woman is a marvel.<br />Callanetics has been around for 2 decades, but I just heard about it recently. I've been doing the &quot;Quick Callanetics&quot; for a week, and already feel taller, stronger, and more agile, after only 20 minutes a day. Also, though the exercises are very hard and &quot;burn&quot;, one doesn't get muscle soreness afterwards, and more importantly, I haven't felt even a twinge of pain in my knees, which has always been a problem with other exercise programs...so Callanetics is (better late than never !) a thrilling find for me.	2002-06-08

There were passages where I marveled at the beauty of the language.<br />Author, poet, and playwright, Reverend Penelope Duckworth is the Episcopal Chaplain to Stanford University, and gives us an insightful and satisfying view on Christianity and its place in our daily life. The thoughts are clearly and simply expressed, and at times very moving. Chapter 9, &quot;Lord,...How Often...?&quot;, which is on forgiveness, and the final chapter, &quot;Salt and Light&quot;, affected me deeply.<br />I love this passage in Chapter 6, &quot;Requisite Virtue&quot;...speaking of charity, humility, and justice, Rev. Duckworth writes: &quot;In Jesus we see the perfection of these virtues, but not in a remote, otherworldly way. Jesus lived in the hurly-burly of life: the dusty roads, the pressing crowds, the surly challenges, and the endless demands. He does not tell us how to live from the serenity of a mountaintop; he shows us in a life replete with blood, sweat, and tears. As the prophets were the voice of God, so Jesus is the life of God seen under human conditions&quot; (pg. 46).<br />This is a book that made me think, and search my soul, and I'm all the better for it.	2002-06-02

Measuring not much more than 5 x 7, it would make the perfect stocking stuffer, or gift for someone who needs some encouragement and a few positive thoughts.<br />Wally has been an adventurous soul, and has a wonderful, easy and humorous way with words. He's had his ups and downs, but has known how to get by with a fearless zest for living.<br />The layout is excellent, and unlike some books of this type, has no wasted space. Its 9 chapters are separated by choice quotes from  wise folks like Confucius and Mark Twain, and a short &quot;Wallymelon Lesson&quot;, like: &quot;My experiences have shown me that life truly is a journey, and the less baggage we carry the easier the ride&quot; (pg. 38).<br />I particularly liked the chapter that deals with the loss of his mother, &quot;Gaining from Loss&quot;. It was tenderly written and quite moving. Though there's no new revelation in this book, it's an easy, refreshing read, like spoonfulls of cheer, with a lot of heart.<br />&quot;...we are all strands in the tapestry of life. Whatever we do to the tapestry, we do to ourselves&quot; (pg.83).	2002-05-26

It includes &quot;Where to get a cat&quot;, an interesting section on &quot;The cat's body: How it functions&quot;, &quot;Nutrition&quot;, and &quot;Care and training&quot;, where the only thing I disagree with is the option of declawing, which was done so frequently decades ago.<br />It ends with &quot;Your cat and the community&quot;, on laws, and your responsibilites as a cat owner.<br />Part Three: &quot;Your Cat's Health&quot;, details a wide range of ailments, first aid treatment, and home care for the sick or injured cat.<br />Part Four is &quot;Reproduction&quot;. Spaying/neutering, the care of a pregnant cat, and much more.<br />Part Five is &quot;Old Age&quot;. This is a small section, but covers all the important points.<br />J.J. McCoy was manager of the Bide-A-Wee Home for Animals in New York City, and chairman on the Board of Animal Regulation.

It gives a &quot;quick guide&quot; to 8 species of these beautiful birds, with lovely photos to help identification. It also shows how one can set up feeders specifically for orioles, and the sugar solution to use, which is slightly different from that of the hummer mixture.<br />Chapters on the &quot;Hummingbird Habitat&quot; and &quot;Gardening&quot;, give you a list of plants and flowers that hummers like the most, by geographical region. &quot;Amazing Facts&quot; truly is amazing. Among the many fascinating things you'll learn is that their heart can beat 1,260 times per minute, but can sometimes slow down to 50 beats per minute at night to conserve energy. There are other chapters on &quot;Myths&quot;, &quot;Baby Hummingbirds&quot;, and &quot;Photographing Hummingbirds&quot;.<br />Nearly half the book is devoted to the identification of the different species, with photos, maps, behaviour patterns, and much more.

Its 10 chapters are broken down into short pieces (93 in all), and when quoting from the Torah or a rabbinical saying, the original Hebrew is written below the quote.<br />This slim volume could easily be read in one day, but I don't think you would want to...it's a book to savor and reflect upon, because in its simplicity, there is much depth.<br />\\"The begining was seeing for even one moment<br />That there was something more to reality<br />Than meets the eye.<br />The end is seeing for even one moment<br />That the apparent multiplicity<br />Is in reality a unity\\"<br />...	2002-05-01

A lot of the information was gleaned from a book written by the First Mate, Owen Chase, and from a notebook (not found until 1960), belonging to Thomas Nickerson, who was all of 14 when he became cabin boy on the Essex.<br />The final chapter tells what happened to the survivors, and how the whaling industry, and life on Nantucket, changed in the following years...there is also an epilogue, that takes place in present day Nantucket.<br />This is one of the most riveting books I've read. An unforgettable true adventure, stranger and more exciting than any fiction.	2002-04-09

The book is 9 x 12, and its 128 pages are mostly devoted to Kahlo's art, so the biography of her is detailed with a minimum of text, but includes the essentials for one to get to know this great artist. She writes of her tumultuous relationship with Diego Rivera, as well as the many other events that made her life a full but tragic one, and in describing her pictures, manages to interpret them quite well.<br />Though so well known for her portraits, the two pictures that thrill me the most in this book are still lifes...one from 1942 on page 110 (there's an incredible, lush and vivid detail of it on pages 96-97), and &quot;Still Life with Parrot&quot; from '51 on page 113. The fruit and vegetables seem to dance with energy, and there are always a few cut open, exposing the insides, and their seeds.<br />The quality of this book is wonderful, with thick, glossy paper (making it feel heavy for its size), and the color reproduction is vibrant. For anyone interested in Kahlo's work, this is a lovely book to own and treasure.	2002-03-09

I wept, I felt the inner ache, and felt the beauty of it, and with the beauty came hope and healing. If the nightmare of war can bring about great works of poetry, then somehow there must be the seed for good in everything. Though this book is about Viet Nam, it's also about today. As long as hatred exists in the world, we will need poetry like this to restore our sanity.<br />Grady Harp writes with a simplicity that gets to the very core of his subject...in the face of horror, he tapped into his genius<br />Stephen Freedman's \\"Metaphors in Clay\\" are exquisite, with Grady's words on them, they provide the perfect visual balance and are three dimensional poems. There's a holiness to them. Their shapes have an aesthetic grace, and they seem to hold a spiritual energy that transmits even through the photographs.<br />I tried to pick a favorite poem/sculpture, but couldn't...# 4 ? # 10 ? 11 ? 13 ?. No, this work is a whole. There isn't a single word or piece of clay that doesn't fit or can be left out...a little masterpiece that doesn't take long to read, but will stay in your heart for keeps.

It gets dropped, laid open with other books on top of it, etc. I use it constantly. I must. I'm a terrible speller.<br /><br />Rarely do I look up a word that's not included (and I look up some obscure ones!), and it has lots of extras. The \\"New Words\\" section is funny. It has everything from \\"Abs\\" to \\"Yada-yada-yada\\"...\\"Guide for Writers\\" (I should read that someday!)...\\"Avoiding Insensitive and Offensive Language\\" for the politically correct out there...\\"Glossary of Business Terms\\" if you need to figure out the fine print on a document, and much more.<br /><br />The words entries are in a bold clear print, making them easy to find, and the quality of the paper is excellent and of a good thickness (I have many dictionaries with paper so thin the print on the reverse side is visible).<br />It's a sturdy little volume, ideal for daily use, and its bright red and yellow cover makes it a cheerful one too.<br />Update 2/2006: The cover is getting a little worn looking (there is a thin film of plastic that is peeling off), but the binding is still solid, after all these years of daily use!	2002-01-04

In the chapter titled &quot;How I Paint&quot;, she says: &quot; I noticed that the blue of my paints wasn't blue enough to get the intensity of that New Mexico sky. I painted the sky red instead. I painted Jazz yellow. He was a brown dog, but yellow expressed him better. Color became fluid&quot;.<br />There's a chapter on her father, with 7 paintings of him, the first from '78, the last, '98...wonderful portraits, with a sadness in them, despite the vivid colors.<br />Another chapter, &quot;A Deep Source of my Writing&quot;, is about how her writing and painting are interrelated.<br />She writes of her European travels, her visits to the Musee Matisse, Cezanne's studio, the Kafka Museum, and so much more...with an easy flow that makes reading a pleasure, but it's the paintings that captivate me.<br />Her interiors are incredible..ordinary places like bathrooms and kitchens, turned into playgrounds of glorious color...her buildings and outdoor scenes are also amazing (her sense of perspective is fabulous !), but I love her cars best of all. If I could own one painting, it would be the green Chevy truck on page 22. It seems to have a face, with a side window that's winking at me.<br />This is a very special book, so full of life and love. It makes me laugh, inspires me, gives me hope and warms my heart.	2002-01-01

I realize that is a Westernized viewpoint, and tastes vary...but these beautiful one-of-a-kind works of art were originaly intended to cover a tent floor...to the point of overlapping at times ! My preference is to see them in close proximity to each other, a glorious mosaic of rich color and design.<br />I also disagree with the statement that the rug has to &quot;match its surroundings&quot;, which is like buying a painting to match the sofa. To my way of thinking, a piece of art, whether a painting or rug, should give one an uplifting thrill, not &quot;match&quot; something.<br />The first 4 chapters are on everything from detailed descriptions of how rugs are made, where to buy them, their care and repair, and the ethnic groups worldwide that make them.<br />This is followed by brilliantly colored illustrations of 44 rugs and 3 bags, from the marvelous Belouch animal design that graces the cover to a Navaho pictorial flatweave.<br />Chapter 5 is about the designs, and how to identify them. Chapter 6 is on the regions (maps are included). 7 and 8 are on the tribal groups, from those in Adraskand, to the Yurks, and describes the patterns, colors, and quality produced by each group.<br />So though I don't agree with the decorating ideas, it's 5 stars for the research and remarkable detail that has been put into this volume. It's an excellent primer, as well as a good reference book.	2001-11-20

Most famous for his Stolichnaya ads, his art is totally unique, with a rich surface. His creations are of a fantasy world that delights the eye and uplifts the soul.<br /><br />This book has wonderful examples of his art, with glossy reproductions of this brilliantly colored work.

There is also a biographical essay, bibliography, chronology, collections, exhibits, and several photos of Yuri.<br /><br />His technique is unusual and lacquer recipe kept secret. Painted in oil, with gold, bronze and copper over canvas. Many of them are as large as 48 x 84 inches. As well as the 91 paintings illustrated there are 9 detail plates, which make me marvel at his skill. Yuri's art is enchanting, and to quote him: \\"I have to make people happy.

Profusely illustrated (mostly in color), the art is in every conceivable style from traditional landscapes to avant garde installations, the earliest is from 1898, and the most recent from 1995.<br />There aren't too many full page illustrations, usually 2 or 3 to a page, and I suspect the colors are quite muted compared to the originals...but it makes up for this in quantity and variety. It also includes a chapter on Chicano art, as well as an extensive bibliography by country.<br />Each chapter is by a writer familiar with the art of the country being discussed (most of them museum directors/curators or art history professors), and though the writing style may vary, it's informative...the print however, is painfully small, limiting its use for my eyes as a reference book, rather than one I could read cover to cover.<br />Three pieces I love are from Mexico: The incredible Rodolfo Morales' &quot;Juicio Final&quot; (pg. 15), from Cuba: Mariano Rodriguez' &quot;El Gallo Pintado&quot; (pg.91), and from Venezuela: Hector Poleo's &quot;Los Comisarios&quot; (pg. 142).	2001-08-18

Categorized into themes, chapter # 1 is &quot;The New World&quot;, with the fabulous wall paintings at Cacaxtla and Teotihuacan. # 2: &quot;People of the Sun&quot; focuses on some beautiful churches, as well as a few walls and doors. # 3: &quot;A Sky Blue Balcony&quot;, has close-ups of brilliantly hued walls, balconies and building details. # 4: &quot;The Brown Madonna&quot;, has everything from church niches to marketplace candies and more muli-colored walls. # 5: &quot;The Space of Light&quot;, on modern Mexican architecture, and the colors that bring so much warmth to its clean, stark lines...with some of my favorite combinations, like apple green and bright pink...and that deep yellow that contrasts so well with the blues and aquas.<br />The essays that are with these photographs are interesting and strangely poetic. At first I found the writing somewhat peculiar, then realized it's translated from the Spanish (by Aurora Camacho de Schmidt) in an almost literal manner...but once you get into the rhythm of it, is excellent.<br />This hardback edition seems bigger than 160 pages because of its weight, with good quality thick pages, it's a sturdy volume. This book is much more about color than it is about Mexico, and for those of us who love color, it's a satisfying volume.	2001-08-04

Her rich and imaginitive still life and landscape paintings have been a huge inspiration and an influence in my own art.<br />Her perspective on the ordinary objects of life, transforming them into pure beauty, and her amazing eye for composition make her work unique and immediately recognizable...and her use of color is dazzling.<br />On those rare occasions that I've had &quot;empty canvas syndrome&quot;, this is the book that I've taken refuge in...I come away from looking through its magical pages with a fresh vision and a renewed spirit.<br />The text is excellent, divided into chapters of her early work ('40's-'60's), later work ('72-'94), and a biographical section. It also has a list of her exhibits, 5 photos, 11 black and white drawings, and 59 paintings in full color...which get more radiant in the 1990's, when she was in her late 70's (she was born in 1915).<br />Some of my favorites are &quot;Red Still Life with Hopjes Tin&quot;, &quot;Mel's Bunch&quot;, which is a jug full of carnations with 3 onions on a table, and &quot;The Fierce Girl and her Roses&quot;. My only complaint would be that there are no sizes to the work, but taking a guess from the photos of her studio, they seem to be in the 20 to 30 inch range.<br />To quote the book: &quot;Mary Fedden's painting reflects her personality in its capacious love for the the objects of its attention&quot;...let Mary change how you view your universe with her joyous work...you'll find yourself looking at a mustard pot in a new way, and maybe wanting to paint it !	2001-08-02

Chapter 1 will open your eyes to just how much you've been &quot;domesticated&quot;...&quot;Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive and express what we really are&quot;.<br />Chapter 2: The power of language. &quot;If you make an agreement with yourself to be impeccable with your word, just with that intention, the truth will manifest through you and clean out all the emotional poison that exists within you&quot;.<br />Chapter 3: I love this chapter ! It's about not taking anything personally. &quot;Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves&quot;<br />Chapter 4 is about not making assumptions, and the chaos we create when we make them. Chapter 5 is about just doing your best...not trying to do more, or being lazy and doing less. &quot;If you do your best always, over and over, you will become the master of transformation&quot;.<br />Chapter 6: &quot;Breaking old agreements&quot;. Breaking free of &quot;domestication&quot;...another great chapter, one that will challenge and change you. Chapter 7 is about achieving &quot;Heaven on earth&quot;, and the book ends with 2 lovely prayers.<br />This little book of wisdom in the ancient Toltec tradition will help you find the path of the warrior, and the freedom to be &quot;Master of your own dream&quot;.	2001-05-02

I'm giving it 5 stars, because if it brings even one person to the full awareness of its meaning, it deserves 5 stars.<br />On my 5th reading of the Bible, over a year ago, this verse &quot;jumped&quot; out at me...overwhelmed me with its power, its direct connection to God the Source of All, and the reciprocal connection when living within His will. That of course, is the starting point, the willingness to live within His will. You can't take this verse out of the context of who Jabez was.<br />When you ask for your boundaries to be enlarged, they won't be enlarged the way you think, or have ever imagined. It will be much bigger...walls will be knocked down, new inner worlds visited.<br />Be willing to walk the path He has in store for you, and you'll be amazed. I have this prayer framed, and read it, think it, and &quot;feel it&quot; every day. It's not about &quot;things&quot;, or getting it &quot;your way&quot;, it's about the infinite, boundless and merciful love of God.	2001-04-28

If you like to turn on the TV and play &quot;guess the movie&quot;, you'll find it invaluable.<br />Though I don't always agree with the reviews, the 1030 pages of A-Z video descriptions are very complete, it includes many foreign films, and has a healthy sense of humor throughout the entire tome. The ratings are in &quot;dog talk&quot;, ranging from &quot;4 BONES&quot; for the likes of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, to &quot;WOOF !&quot; for Showgirls.<br />If you like trivia and lists, this is list heaven. It has an &quot;Alternate Title&quot; list, a &quot;Category&quot; list, &quot;Kibbles &amp; Series&quot;, &quot;Awards&quot; index, and the most complete cast, director, writer, cinematographer, and composer indexes you can get.<br />With each new issue, extras are added, so this is a good one to update at least every other year, besides...your copy will be worn out by then...<br />...and a meaty butcher's bone to editor Jim Craddock and this &quot;Cunning Canine Production&quot; for giving us a book I can't live without !	2001-04-21

Was it just media excess up to its usual tricks ? Could be, ya never know !<br />Or, was old Al just like those people &quot;near and dear&quot; to us, who will say anything, blame anyone, and re-write history if necessary, to justify their actions ? Yes, I have a feeling Mr. Wolf had a big weasel streak in him. It would be interesting to read this story with kids and point out these two viewpoints, and how good it feels to be able to say &quot;I did it, and I'm sorry&quot;.<br />The illustrations by Lane Smith are brilliant, expressive, and with a lot of wit...the &quot;protein&quot; in the giant cheeseburger is so funny !...there are details that will keep you entertained for several viewings, and the use of newspaper cuttings is great. This is a unique and imaginitve book for all ages...the adults I think will appreciate it the most, because old Al will remind us of a few people we know...	2001-03-31

It's well written, very detailed, and in three sections.<br />Part 1, &quot;The Mexican Folk Retablos&quot;: The origins of these small religious oil paintings, usually on tin, are described, as well as terminology, materials, the artists (mostly unknown), and much more. The chapter is completed with 28 images of the Holy Family, and each plate is described on the facing page. The wonderful piece depicted on the cover, &quot;La Inmaculada&quot;, is one of them.<br />Part 2, &quot;Saints as Subjects&quot;: This starts with the problem of identification, as finding out which saint is pictured is quite a feat. It goes into the function of these retablos, and their changing popularity as time progressed. It concludes with 36 images of saints, that are inspiring and beautifully executed. I find # 31, &quot;San Antonio de Padua&quot;, extraordinary.<br />Part 3, &quot;The Mexican Ex-Voto Painting&quot;: An ex-voto is a story painting, done as a commemoration to answered prayer. This chapter deals with the characteristics of these lovely pieces, their development and decline. It gives 17 examples of this unique art form, along with a description, as well as a legible printing of the writing on the painting, in Spanish and English. The back of the book has bibliography, notes, indexes, etc.<br />If you appreciate Mexican art, this will be a wonderful addition to your library, and if you like Russian icons, as I do, it makes a fascinating comparison, especially plate # 4, &quot;Nuestro Se&ntilde;or de los Trabajos&quot;, and plate # 62, &quot;Santiago&quot;, pictured with sword in hand and on horseback.<br />The author, Gloria Fraser Giffords, has done a marvelous work with this volume, bringing us an area of Mexican culture that doesn't get as much attention as it deserves.	2001-01-25

This is perhaps the most lavishly beautiful book of artifacts and design I've seen in recent years. It has 21 chapters, starting with &quot;The Painted Wall&quot;. Chapter 2 is the simply awesome &quot;Tiles&quot;, followed by &quot;La Cocina&quot;, with more exquisite tiles and fabulous cookware. I love the kitchen sink with the retablos and crosses on the wall above it !<br />Among the many chapters, there's one on &quot;Textiles&quot;, &quot;Folk Art&quot;, &quot;Ceramics&quot;, &quot;Wood&quot; (masks that are works of art and the whimsical carvings from Oaxaca). &quot;Metal&quot;: The loveliest door knockers you'll ever see, and my favorite of all (I have a small but glorious collection), the marvelous milagros.<br />There are also chapters on inns, homes along the coasts, the homes of 4 artists (to die for !), etc., and one on patios and gardens.<br />The photographs by Melba Levick are as good as it gets, a short (you wouldn't want any more...the focus is on the photography) but excellent text by Tony Cohan, which gives a brief history and description of the items shown, and the creative direction was done by Masako Takahashi. It's a good size soft cover at 10&quot; x 9 1/2 and the quality is great.<br />It's a book you can browse through over and over and discover new little details, and the beauty of it will gladden your heart and inspire you to add more color to your home, especially Mexican color, which is so full of life and soul.	2000-12-12

I read all of Marilyn's &quot;Fit for Life&quot; books, which were excellent, but a bit too dogmatic for my taste. Here she has a more &quot;No more food guilt&quot; and &quot;no more 'food cops'&quot; approach. She has taken the best of what she learnt from those years of her life, and with the help of Dr. Schnell, brought it up to a new level.<br />What she has to say about &quot;inner cleanliness&quot; in Chapter 3 I firmly believe is the secret to good health. For me, this is the most important chapter in the book, and a subject that is sadly neglected by many other health experts...as Marilyn says: &quot;This is not a chic topic. Legions of authors aren't lining up to give you a heart-to-heart talk on this subject&quot;. But Marilyn does, and Dr. Schnell gives you the medical low down. A must-read chapter.<br />This isn't about diets, it's about a way of life, put forth in a logical, easy to implement way, and also includes a great set of exercises and some excellent recipes.<br />Bravo Marilyn ! May you keep learning, keep changing, and keep teaching.	2000-10-19

York Membery closes the book by saying &quot;of course, nothing is  certain in the fickle world of the movies.

At the end of the book there is a  glossary of terms, a list of artistic movements, and a museum directory.  The reproductions are of very high quality and take up about half a page.  It's a great book just to look at, but for someone who wants to gain  knowledge of the subject, and for students, this marvelous little book  (it's only 5 + 6 1/2 but quite thick) is a must. Phaidon did a splendid  thing putting out this volume...you'll love it !	2000-08-02

From the psychology of selling to legal matters, it covers it all. The amount of information is overwhelming...I went through it with a highlighter checking off the  sections that were applicable to my needs, and then read those sections in  depth. Whether you are a beginner or a seasoned professional, you'll gain a  lot from this and will maximize your potential and earning power. Being an  artist today requires the kind of knowledge contained in this volume,  because the competition is fierce. Perhaps you have more talent than the  next guy, but if he has the marketing skills, the world will be looking at  his art instead of yours. Get this book and make the most of your artistic  gift !	2000-08-01

The listings are great and have details such as who to contact and what their terms are. Also, many companies have a web  site so you can see if your work would \\"Fit in\\" their catalog.  What I most like about this book are the articles. \\"Do's and Don'ts of  Art Licensing\\" is invaluable...read this before signing a contract..  please !  My favorite, however, are the \\"Success Stories\\". One of  them, by Jim Hunt, a terrific cartoonist, tells how to use your e-mail  & web site for maximum no-cost marketing. I tried it. It works.

Keanu Reeves , who at 23 gives the impression of being a bundle of  unsettled energy, with intelligence and a marvelous sense of humor...Brad  Pitt, hilarious and quite down to earth at 24, the same age as a profound  and thoughtful Johnny Depp. The exquisitely beautiful Alfre Woodard, so  wise at 33, a perplexing Robert Downey Jr. at 22. There's a total of 24  interviews, and the photographs are fabulous. The ones of Reeves, Depp, and  Jason Priestly are simply awesome ! This book is a glimpse into what makes  some actors break forth and get known, while so many others fail. A lot of  these future stars seem to have hard work (and the love of it) in common,  as well as quick minds and curiosity.	2000-07-25

It contains exquisite poetry, mostly written by his father, Arseniy Tarkovsky,  and detailed descriptions of the making of several of his films as well as  photos of them that are eerie, mystical, and incredibly beautiful.  Tarkovsky is the master of making us see the wonder of creation in the most  mundane subjects. He brings us one step closer in our journey towards the  light. From page 43: &quot;The allotted function of art is not, as is often  assumed, to put across ideas, to propagate thoughts, to serve as an  example. The aim of art is to prepare a person for death, to plough and  harrow his soul, rendering it capable of turning to good&quot;.	2000-07-17

No one is perfect, and Kerouac never claimed to be. This is a  record of his struggle and search for enlightenment. Should those who judge  his method and life ever attain 10% of what this man achieved, it will  surprise me. &quot;The Book of Pure Truth consists of a bunch of mirrors  bound in a volume&quot;.
