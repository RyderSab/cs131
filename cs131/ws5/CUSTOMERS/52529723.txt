After carefully going through one c# book on design patterns. I had anticipated that going through the lhotka c# business objects book would be a breeze but boy was I wrong. Mr. Lhotka uses OO to the extreme in his framework and outlines his reasons behind tailoring the OO to his base classes in his framework unlike other book. Design patterns are for small apps. Enterprise applications take advice from this book. I have yet to see another book with this kind of detail and quality. <br /> <br />This books is as good as his c# 1.1 book. <br />I have noticed that it helps to know his c# 1.1 business  <br />object book first since this 2005 book builds on top of  <br />the first so it's good to have both projects (1.1 and 2.0) <br />open side to see the improvements. <br /> <br />Covers improvement in architecture from the csla framework  <br />whilst taking advantage of the new c# 2.0 features.	2005-09-09

All examples were simple standard exe type.<br />For the price of the book, I expected a lot more for my money.<BR>By the way  chapter 1-10 could have been condensed to 2-3 chapters. It was very long winded and the climax wasn't there.<br />I did like the small section on sql error handling	2002-09-22

I was however <BR>disapointed in the poor explanations into how the <BR>program worked. This was cruicial since if the example <BR>did not work, i would have no idea how to debug it. <BR>In addition the lack of or poor explanation would make <BR>the book extremely difficult to finish off since the <BR> foundations of the technology was never explained.<BR>This is somewhat of an advanced book however, i did <BR>give it 3 stars due to working examples did work, even <BR>though I learnt v little in why.<br />As mentioned from a previous reviewer, the downloads are badly disorganised, its a very tough book to get through and there are <BR>already errors in chapter5 alongside missing downloadble examples	2002-09-18

Few things to note there are errors cropping up in his later chapters like the windows service installer excercises and asynchronous callback example, the update in edit data in datagrid. The last three chapters were very clumpsily put together in which someone with 7 years of exp cannot put together why they were even there when the explanation and example were of poor quality. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good dummies book, however after finishing the blueprint examples, a vb.net beginner wrox book would be the next book one should go for to fill in the gaps	2002-09-08

This was the only book I found in the market which removed most of the complexities of c++.net and left only the basics. It took me just 2 months on and off and typing every excersise and demo to understand and add c++.net to my skillset. Although this book is basic, I now have the ability to look at more advance books now which most C++.net books are written for.<br />There is however no database access code and no examples to show you how to distribute shared assemblies in the GAC. In addition no code to demonstrate interaction with web services.	2002-07-28
