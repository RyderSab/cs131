Thanks to Dr. Ken Thompson's work, we have the standard 5-piece (also some of other simple) endgame database. Based on Dr. Thompson's database, Dr. John Nunn prepared a 3-volumn book-set that covers \\"almost all\\" 5-piece endings. Rook and Pawn versus Rook is the first of the set. Using the symmetric property, they are able to cut the workload to 25%. By writing from the white's point-of-view, who has material advantage, the work is cut by half; then by mirroring the Q-side and K-side, only work for the P on the Q-side is sufficient (another 50% reduction). The final positions are: a) white can promote the P (win), b) white wins black R (win), c) black can eliminate white P (draw) (and force trading R's.) The study starts with the P on the 7th rank to see if it's a win or draw. Then the P retreats one step to 6th rank, and continues all the way to 2nd rank. <br />A few years ago, I know only one R and P ending (Lucena position) and about four general rules: <br />1) Rook on the seventh is worth one (or even two) P-sacrifice. <br />2) Active Rook is important in the endgame. <br />3) The side with material advantage has \\"more\\" chance to win if he can cuts off the defending K. <br />4) The defender should get his K in front of the P; otherwise he has \\"less\\" chance to draw. <br />\\"More or less\\" are relative terms here. In this book, Dr. Nunn provides the \\"absolute truth\\" about this type of endings. <br />His work in this book is outstanding (5 stars). I wonders who could remember most of the analysis he gives in the book. He mentions that even Kasparov might have trouble to play this with such precision. So, how practical is the book? I don't see how the average players can see the practicality of this book (I can't), except for the practical tips Nunn gives at the end of every section. That's a good place to start. If we want simpler study, then Averbakh's Essential Chess Endings is another good start. My C- and B-players don't care much for simple endings; they like toplay with pieces. This is where I have a little edge on them. The analysis from Nunn's ending set provides a good means for post-mortem discussion. <br />	2005-10-13

Don't let the old style and skinniness of the book fool us. <br />This book is a good instructional one. The author did not provide many examples, but gave the main brief principles and elaborated more with words. His explanation is clear and deep if we pay attention to the details. His 70 plus pages contain as much information as 300 pages in Silman's The Amateur's Mind. His book is to help the intermediate level to improve. <br />There are many principles still very applicable in the modern chess: <br />a) Do not believe all that you are told. Examine, verify, use your reason. <br />b) In war, topography dictates the operations. <br />c) Do not leave any pieces where it has no range of action... <br />d) Haste, the great enemy. <br />All great advises. <br /> <br />However, there are some that the intermediate level has problem with or makes the modern players think \\"hmm.\\" <br />a) Avoid mistakes. How? <br />I recall some GM's comment of the intermediate's move: \\"When the intermediate moves a piece, he makes a tactical mistake; when he moves a pawn, a positional mistake. Well? <br />b) Do not modify your plan. What? Any player knows that not all plans work out correctly, while both sides try to interfere with the other's plan. The battle plan has to adjust according to the situation. A rigid plan fails. <br /> <br />And there are some advices conflicting each other. On the blockade of the passed pawn, on page 81, he wrote, \\"If your opponent should have a passed pawn, your first and most urgent duty is 'mechanically' to stop its advance--blockade it.\\" <br />If the passed pawn is not mobile (or we have control of the square immediately in front of it) then the blockade is not that urgent (H.H.). He wrote, \\"Unless you analyze the position, you will achieve nothing\\" (on page 42) and \\"Do not play to quickly\\" (on page 48.) <br /> <br />The advices from this book are still very applicable in this modern time. But the offensive and defensive techniques have advanced significantly, some advices need adaptations. <br /> <br />	2005-03-14

At our local chess club, we have about 10 players, and we are at lower class C to class B. I am right in the middle of the pact. More than half of them have this book; I didn't have yet at the time. When I first saw the book title, I laughed so hard. We are \\"serious\\" chess players; we should read \\"Chess for the Pros.\\" What's going here?    One day I played against a strong C player, he was careless, so I traded my Bishop for his Knight in order to win a Pawn. I got the extra Pawn to d5 and my Knight to d4. For the whole time I was clueless about what to do, I just didn't know what to do next, where to attack. I spent lots of time to figure out how to use my material plus, and currently was worried that he would open the position and utilize his Bishop pair. In fact, he was trying to keep the position closed to minimize my \\"advantage\\", however he played very actively (He has many Silman's book.) Finally I could force trading my Knight for one of his Bishops, but in doing so, I doubled up my extra Pawn. Then I lost in time with the extra \\"precious\\" Pawn.    After the game, he asked me why I traded my Knight for his Bishop. I answered, \\"I was concerned about his B-pair.\\" He said I should have maneuvered the N to the 6th rank to attack in such position. So far through the teaching from Chernev's books, I only knew how to post the N on the 5th rank as a way to attack. Never heard of the N-posting at the 6th. He told me, \\"Silman says, the N on the 3rd is for the defensive purpose; on the 4th, as good as a B; on the 5th, stronger than a B for attacking; and on the 6th, a 'killer octopus' (especially protected). Opponent is willing to let go even a Rook for that N and the P protecting it.\\" Two other players agreed with him. No wonder I never passed the middle of the pact. I made up my mind, \\"in order to know your enemy... (Sun Tzu)\\" I must have the book.    After I got the book, I read the first four chapters (Imbalances, B vs. N, Center, and Pawn Structure) and scanned through to the rest of the book. There were a little bit of boredom, the repetition of \\"attacking where your Pawns pointing to\\", and some distractions of the amateurish thoughts of his students. However what else do I expect? The book is steering for this intermediate audience (including me.) Even with the stronger players, if we let them \\"think out loud\\", there would be some \\"amateurish\\" and \\"wandering\\" thoughts too, considering Silman had to listen and write these thoughts down (part of a paid 'therapeutic' job, I guess ;-)). If I pay less attention to the \\"ideas\\" of his students, then his book is sensible. Better yet, replacing his student's thoughts by my own then it seems like I am having some private lessons with IM Silman. Comparing the book's price and the class fee, this is a rather fair/good trade, I think.    As in Nimzovich's My System, Silman provides many good (and/or widely known) rules and give examples to illustrate them. The Key (darkened) Sentences in his book are a good checklist for us to recall for what to do during the game.    Another day, I asked my friend at the club about an adjourned position. In a minor piece ending, I had an extra P but facing my opponent's B-pair with B + N, pawns on both sides of the board. His first sentence after we set up the position is \\"Let's see what the IMBALANCES are\\"!    This book is a four star book after re-reading. One star is off because Nunn, Burgess, Yermo's books already take the 5-star spot. Anyway this book content and format (fonts, diagrams and paper quality, even a little too heavy) are much superior to those of Schiller and Pandolfini's books. I read from a friend \\"How to reassess your chess\\", and some reviews here said that the \\"how to\\" book is equivalent to Nimzovich's My System. Is it too ambitious idea? For the title of this book, The Amateur's Mind (I am too embarrassed to carry the book around, so I have to put a cover on it, ;-): Turning Chess Misconceptions Into Chess Mastery. (?!?!) Wow, Iguess this \\"pretty\\" little book is ALL I need to master chess! (Too ambitious for the supporting phrase.) A simple title like, \\"Silman's My System for his students.\\" (The word \\"My\\" now is always associated with the word \\"System\\" in chess-writing patterned after Nimzovich, like all chess programs after Deep Blue always have the word \\"Deep\\": Deep Fritz, Deep Junior, Deep ...  Just my one cent.)    PS: Also as in Nimzovich's idea of \\"Over-protection\\", which I disagree; Silman's idea on the Connected Passed Pawn is \\"not always strong\\" is not welcome (by me.) I'm working on some counter-examples.  The passed Pawn is good (a weapon), and when it is connected it is even better. How being together can they be bad? Two positives become a negative? YEAH, RIGHT. ;-)	2005-03-13

I agree with some reviewers that I didn't expect Pandolfini's books can be all good, but this book is the exception. It's good. I read this book about three times before and I felt it was so-so; the examples were so simple. Now, I read it again it seems much better, the more I read it the more it makes sense. (Maybe I see too many good class-C and B players do rather well in the openings and middle-games, but are faltered in the endgames. Therefore I try to capitalize in the endgame technique to compensate for when they outplay me in the other two phases of the games!) This book is for the beginner to intermediate. I could learn a lot from it. When I read the section about the King and Pawn endings I saw that Pandolfini gave many examples of the King's positions. When I read Averbakh's Essential Knowledge some time ago, he introduced the theory of key-squares and spent only 5 pages to explain this simple ending, while Pandolfini spent many times more pages to explain the same type of endings. When I get to the parts of Rook + Pawn and Minor Piece + Pawn endings, I realized that Pandolfini explained the same thing except changing the order, and getting more specific. This now becomes more apparent. The Endgame Theory, especially the simple one, is public domain; it depends on the author's interpretation of its significance. Pandolfini uses more words and diagrams to lead the beginner. For this effort, this book deserves three stars. It cannot be more stars because it fell short of Averbakh's work where he presented more practical examples from master-games. I already have Averbakh's book. I don't mind to have Pandolfini's book as extra, which can supply me with some \\"visual snap-shots\\" of the typical endgames when I prepare for some match games. This book is borrowed from a library because I didn't think it was a \\"good investment.\\" Used book at discount price is nice gift.	2005-03-12

I didn't realized how good the book is until recently. Nimzovich's \\"My System\\" is too long, while Evans' New Ideas is too short. Evans also wrote the (very) short introduction for each game in Fischer's My 60 Memorable Games. Likewise, for each example in this book, Evans provides a brief introduction. There is much to learn from these short paragraphs but we have to pay attention to keywords. <br />The four chapters (2, 3, 5, and 6) were devoted to the four topics (Pawn Structure, Force, Space and Time) that Evans thought important for his own \\"system\\". I think even players at 2000 rating can still draw some good lessons from this books, especially chapters about Pawn and Space. I feel the two chapters Space and Time described more about the Strategies and Tactics, and when and how to use them. But how much do I know about chess? Just a personal opinion. Evans knows much more than I. <br />The example's headings can be grouped together on a piece of paper as a checklist, for quick recollection for chess student to sort out for what to do at each stage during the game. <br />Evans didn't provide complete games but gave a quick snapshot at each critical position and explained from there on. Because the number of moves of each example is too few, it does not look that impressive. Actually, with careful look and following his explanation, we can see that the analysis is rather detailed. <br /> <br />PS: This book could be called \\"Evans' My System\\". I didn't see many \\"new ideas\\" in this book, maybe couples of them. But the rest of ideas could be found in the work of older chess masters and writers. Another title could be better match, \\"New Way to See (or Present) Chess Ideas\\". And again this is just another personal opinion. <br />	2005-03-11

Chess Endings are very important, as Lasker, Capablanca and modern chess teachers say.<br /><br />At my small local club, we are all at class C and sub-class B. They are very good tactical players, and prefer to play the middle-games where there are still many pieces left. Player A is the best tactician there, has been the number one for three straight years. (My tactics are not as good as most of theirs. Luckily, I learn a few tips from Chernev's writing.)<br /><br />a) One day (I witnessed), player A obtained a position in Rook Ending, and each side had a Rook. He got four Pawns on the K-side, his opponent (player B) had 2 on the Q-side; the Kings were on the rear of their own Pawns. So far so good. Player B had his K on second rank, while player A had his K on the back-rank! Player A kept giving useless checks and ignored advancing his un-opposed Pawns. Player B cleverly advanced his K and Pawns at every opportunity. To our horror, player B got his Pawn and R to the seventh and his K was right behind them. And we know the rest of the story.<br /><br />b) Weeks later same player A won a Knight for a Pawn from me in the opening. After that, he just moves aimlessly with the goal to win on the clock, while I used my active Rook to win another Pawn. Only then he tried to trade off our last Rooks, which I quickly calculated and complied. Besides his centralized Knight, he had one Pawn on c-file; I had 3 Ps on h-, c- and b-files (all of mine had reached mid-field). His K was on his own third, while mine was at fourth rank. I saw that I could at least have a draw. Because his K was unable to defend both sides simultaneously, I could force him to trade off his last P. To my surprise, he let my b-Pawn become connected passed pawn. And after my K entered his K-side, the game was over. He had to let go his Knight for my h-pawn.<br /><br />c) Another time I visited a cross-town chess club. In a tournament, an expert playing white had Bishop and 2 Pawns versus his sub-1700 opponent who had lone R. All white pieces had reached or passed mid-field with his Pawns on g5 and h6. It was about the adjournment time. The tournament director, also a chess master, came by to observe the game during the black piece player considered his sealed move. I waited for the master to study the position for 20-30 seconds, and then I pulled him aside and whispered to him that the game was a draw. He said, \\"No, white is winning.\\" I then answered that all black had to do was to give check to white K via the back-rank and trade his R for white g-Pawn (white could not block the check by his B!); white was left with the wrong colored B! That was the first and only time I could show-off my \\"computing prowess\\" to a master, ;-). The story didn't end here. While the sub-1700 player was working out his sealed move, the expert said, \\"It doesn't take much longer, let's play a few more moves.\\" I think, the expert felt regrettable for saying that so he immediately corrected, \\"Let's get together over the weekend and finish our game.\\" Now isn't it something? I just learned a lesson on how a chess player should treat an inferior opponent!<br /><br />Three examples above show that endgame experience can be really important and fun. Now let us go back to the book FCE. This book is masterwork. The cover is beautifully designed. The book is reasonable size and light. It is larger than The Amateur's Mind both in size and content, but is more comfortable to handle. The content table in front and the table of database on the back provide two quick ways to search for the positions of interest. The analysis is professionally deep. The explanation of each chapter and section is very clear and easy to follow. The font, the diagrams, and layout are very handsome. This book doesn't have as much examples as Fine's BCE, but the critical positions are all here, and the analysis is much deeper and more accurate. Almost all the positions are from actual games so they are very realistic. For correspondent games, I often search this book for the endgames like Q + Ps, R + Ps, Minor Piece endings. Before I have FCE, I used BCE mainly, but BCE doesn't have enough diagrams and is dated. It may take me at least 5 complete years to study this book; and Fine, at least 10 years. This book is classic (I hope the paper and spine will last long for at least 20 years), I don't mind to have an extra copy to write the experimental notes.I often search this book for the endgames like Q + Ps, R + Ps, Minor Piece endings.

US	43954135	R930WNUVU1RZ9	0812934938	979201219	Basic Chess Endings	Books	5	6	10	N	N	One of Fine's masterpieces.	I bought the '72 edition BCE from a flea-market 20 years ago for one (1) full buck! And it has helped me countless time until I have chess programs or Fundamental Chess Endings. Often after I played an interesting ending, I came back and check with the BCE to see why the game was lost or won, or where it can be improved. <br />Just take a close look on how conscientious Fine prepared his table of contents; we may know the quality of his labor. He did it before the age we have database, cross-reference tables. During his time this work is equivalent to a set of 10 CD-ROM in this present time, and he didn't have any computer to assist him to organize the notes. <br />The book has about: <br />a) 80 pages on K + P endings. <br />b) 30 pages on N + P endings. <br />c) 70 pages on B + P endings. <br />d) 70 papers on mixed minor piece endings. <br />e) 160 pages on R + P endings. <br />f) 80 pages on R + minor pieces <br />g) 50 pages on Q (+ pieces) endings. <br />It has 600 diagrams, that was a lot for the time when graphical work and printing cost expensively. I just estimate that for each position with enclosed diagram, there are 4 without. There must be about 3000 positions in his books. If a class C player, like myself, studies and understands one position per day, ten years must be invested. Now it's just for studying the book, how long does it take to research and write it? When I re-typed Chernev's Chessboard Magic (160 endgames) with computer verification for personal use, it took about two months. Retyping Averbakh's Essential Knowledge cost another one month. That was not even talking about original thinking and writing. <br />A few times I wanted to enter those positions in BCE to my CM8000 to see how accurate they are or how much they can be improved. But after trying with Chernev's and Averbakh's books I know this task is impossible. We must give credit to Benko for taking up this task. There will be some typos (during translation from Descriptive Notation) for the new algebraic edition, but I think it is acceptable. How do we plan to check for errors in the analysis? Chess program. What if chess program has errors? (See my review for CM8000.) <br />I think, if I can learn at least 1/2 of each of five sections (e, d, c, f, and b; my opinion of order of importance) and, say, 1/4 of all critical positions in other two sections, I can get to the expert level. If it's true, we can see what a wide range of audience BCE is written for. It's obvious that the first edition of BCE is in 1941, so we can't expect to see many examples from post WW II to the modern time. That's why FCE is a good compliment to Fine's BCE. <br />Fine's original work is a 5-star book. With Benko's improvement, I expect it can only get better (I don't have the new one yet). If there are some typos or errors in analysis (unintentionally), this is part of the evolution process. Comparing to many bad chess books in the market, this one is a good buy. <br />	2005-03-11
US	43954135	R2WLO71SMJKV28	081293475X	522576511	The Art of Positional Play	Books	4	4	6	N	N	welcome to "reality" chess, not all games are short & sweet	With the used titles: The Art of Defense and the Art of Attack, then why not the Art of Positional Play (TAoPP)? My first \\"chess teacher\\" of positional play is Chernev. His writing is interesting and instructive (and \\"short and sweet\\").  I bought this book (with descriptive notation, pub. by McKay) 20 years ago. I went over about half of the games and finally gave up. There were 3 problems (one with the publisher, two with the games) that made me give up. Interestingly, all 3 \\"problems\\" (all are correctable) are still applicable to the new edition somewhat. One \\"problem\\" indirectly caused the next one to appear. They are:  1) The book is in *descriptive notation*.  2) There are many long games. 27 games with 50 moves or more; 9 games with 70 moves or more. The shortest game is 26 moves; the longest one is 90.  3) There are \\"many\\" draws. 5; Wow! That many, huh? ;-)    Now, the corrective actions:  1) Actually, I was kidding about the descriptive notation. I have no problem with it. According to some reviewers, the new Algebraic Notation edition has too many errors; therefore the old Descriptive Notation is a \\"blessing\\". It was just the book was published that long ago, McKay Co. didn't bother to use a good binding technology, (as bad as the Mammoth Book of The World Greatest Chess Games, pub. by Carroll and Graf.) Except TAoPP used thicker papers (WORSE, about 3 times as thick as in Mammoth), and narrower width which make the book harder to open flat. The binding and glue on the spine are not good. The heat and dry weather make the glue crack by itself, and leaves much dust. The book spine was broken in four or five different places. All right, this is the publisher's fault.  2) Because the book is hard to open, I am nervous to use it (cumbersome to handle and don't want to damage it more and more), especially over the long games. I used to Chernev's writing where he often picked \\"short and sweet\\" games for his books. (For long games, more diagrams may be needed, andthen it would make the book even thicker. And problem continues.)  3) And I, chess-student, like a movie-goer; I want to see happy (or decided or won) endings. Draws are no good. For this book, in particular, after much effort to fight to save the book spine, going over 60 moves (plus some sub-variations) the game was not won. That's sad. (Chernev's selection is always decided.)    Having discussed the last two \\"problems\\", now I see that they are not \\"problems\\" at all. They are in fact the good \\"learning experiences\\". It's just my lack of patience for the long games and I used to short writing of Chernev (His selected games are about 35-40 moves in average). At sub-1700 and up, I begin to see the hard and long fighting the opponents are willing to throw in when they are down by 2 pawns or even a minor piece. Patience is mother-of-all-skills at this stage. I saw many games (including mine) lost after gaining substantial early advantages. And the drawn games are good examples for not giving up too soon. Down in position or about 1 or 2 pawns in material is not a total defeat; there are still some ways to save a lost game. Perseverance plays a major role in these situations.    In summary, a little knowledge of old descriptive notation is a good thing, it helps to come back and study the original classic writings. For this book, McKay should think on how to bind the book neatly and professionally, make it a permanent produce. The last two \\"concerns\\" (change of tone after many years of \\"enlightenment\\") long and drawn games are still important, necessary and the facts of chess-life. Prepare to face the long games from tough defensive players; and half a point is much better than no point at all.  The book deserves 4 stars. The categorization of the book is logical. It lacks of list of players (to search for favorite players). I'm not surprise to see that Reshevsky's win record in this book is 100% (and mostly he was on the white side). This makes Fischer's My 60 Memorable Games more subjective and valuable.    PS: As a side note, Reshevsky is a master of Queen Pawn Opening as this book shows. I don't recall how his games with King Pawn Opening were. But against the King Pawn Opening (vs. Smyslov, Keres or Fischer), his positions many times look rather clumsy. It's just my observation.	2005-03-10

In 1985 I bought this book (1975 ed., pub. by McKay.) I tried to read it and didn't understand much. Fifteen years later, I tried again and it was still. Now I need to read it before going to the next level with Watson's book.  Nimzovich's My System is a difficult book to write (and confusing at times to read.) He wrote it for both advanced players and beginners. For I'm a beginner, I only can reflect from this standpoint. There are a lot of confusions to me. There are 3 parts in My System: 1) The Elements, 2) Positional Play and 3) Illustrated games (I bought this book because his games inside were so impressive).  I just went quickly over the dated explanations (didn't go over the detail examples) because I want to start Watson soon.  So far with part 1 alone I observed these confusions.  ---(A.N.)  Chapter 1 section 2: A Pawn move must not in itself be regarded as a developing move, but merely as an aid to development. An important postulate for the beginner is the following:-If it were possible to develop the pieces without the aid of Pawn moves, the Pawn-less advance would be the correct one; for, as suggested, the Pawn is not a fighting unit in the sense that his crossing of the frontier is to be feared by the enemy, since obviously the attacking force of the Pawns is small compared with that of the pieces. However, the Pawn-less advance is in reality impossible of execution; since the enemy Pawn-center, thanks to its inherent aggressiveness, would drive back the pieces which we had developed. For this reason we should, in order to safeguard the development of our pieces, first build up a Pawn-center.  ---(H.H.)  a) In the old time, people played \\"brilliantly\\" mainly with pieces; they delivered \\"lightning\\" checkmates. With the advance defense the attack by pieces alone is easily and forcefully repulsed.  b) Without Pawn-moves, no Queen, Bishops or Rooks can be developed.  c) Here Nimzovich conceded that the enemy Pawns would repulse our Knights therefore we have to push the Pawns to challenge their Pawns for our piece development. So can the Pawns get \\"partial credit\\" for development points?  d) We develop pieces in order to attack opponent's camp. Against advance defense, any attack, no matter how small, even by a Pawn would snowball the attack. So a Pawn is worth the development goal.  e) If Pawn-move is non-developing move, then is there any game that the winner never develops any piece? In Chernev's \\"Wonders and Curiosities of Chess\\", Marshall (or Tarrasch? or Rubinstein?) made only a dozen or so of Pawn moves and won the game!  ---(A.N.)  In chapter 7 (The pin) he wrote: A pinned piece's defensive power is only imaginary. He only makes a gesture as if he would defense: in reality he is crippled and immobile. Hence we may confidently place our pieces en prise to a pinned piece, for he dare not lay hands on it.  ---(H.H.)  Really? The pinned piece still controls the squares within its attacking range. Therefore it can hold back the enemy King who tries to approach and help increasing the pressure on the defender (for example: in the endgame). A pinned Rook (or Bishop) can still pin an enemy Knight (or Pawn) from joining the battle, is it doing defensive task? How about the attacking power of a pinned piece? A pinned black Bishop at b7 still can support an attack of another piece at white Castle at g2-square.  A special case of pin and counter-pin is from the game of xxx-xxx in (maybe) Burgess's Mammoth's Greatest Chess Games. (Please wait. I try to recall the exact location.)  ---(A.N.)  Chapter 8 section 1 (Discovered Check): The degree of relationship between the pin and the discovered check is more closely defined. Where should the piece which discovers the check move to?  ---(H.H.)  Huh? The pinned piece can't move. The piece discovering the check can move freely to where it increases his side's attacking strength. The side X-rays the enemy King is in control of that sector of the board.  ---(A.N.)  Chapter 8 section 2: The see-saw. The long-range masking piece can move to any square in his line of motion without spending a tempo, that is to say, wholly gratis.  ---(H.H.)  I think now we can write: The Windmill check. The long-range piece (Rook or Bishop; why not the Queen? Guess) can give check and uncover check while killing all pieces along its attacking range and still maintain the right of move.  Nimzovich was so attached to the famous game between Torre-Lasker (Moscow, 1925) (Diagram 106) and Diagram 104, that he forgot in Diagram 103 (right-hand side) there is a mate in 4.  ---(A.N.)  Chapter 8 section 3: Double check. Is brought about by the masking piece also giving check. The effectiveness of a double check lies in the fact that of the three possible parries to a check, two are nugatory, namely the capture of the piece giving check and the interposition of a piece. Flight is the one and only resource.  ---(H.H.)  It's simpler like: The double check forces the enemy King to move because either simultaneously capturing both checking pieces or simultaneously blocking the checks on two directions is impossible. If one of the checks is from the Knight, this is self-evident.  ----------------  These are the confusions I have in part 1, I will continue with part 2.  This book is a five star book because many GMs and players recommend it. I need to read more and more to clear all these confusions.  It is the second scientific work in chess. The first is Steinitz' book. Lasker's and Capablanca's books are not comparable. I haven't read Tarrasch yet.  -----------------------------------------------------------  Part 2 (03/03/05):  I think I begin to understand Nimzovich's \\"My System\\". In this book, he contracted all the significant chess concepts into one volume, which he called his hyper-modern. Some ideas were discovered and/or invented by himself, some he credited to the teaching of other masters, Tarrasch for example. He incorporated all these into his hyper-modern strategy. The first part of the book has 7 chapters, which he called the Elements and used them to build his molecules, which he expressed in the Positional Play (part 2).  The first 3 chapters of part, Nimzovich explained about the Yin and Yang (strength and weakness) of: the center, the mobile center pawns, the double Pawns and the isolated Pawns.  In chapter 4, \\"I have arrived at the conclusion that the advantage of the two Bishops can be called neither an element nor a stratagem,\\" wrote Nimzovich. Now, that is more confusion that Confucius. Before him, Steinitz' school and after him, the Soviet school, the Bishop pair can be regarded as both; now he just went \\"to where no-man had gone before.\\"  Chapter 5 introduced the concept of over-protection. This word \\"over\\" causes me some discomfort. The fight between two equal armies, if you put too much force in one place, there will be somewhere you lack of protection (remember Sun Tzu.) I recalled at least in two books about Fischer's games, the authors praised on how economical Fischer used his pieces. Then if we come to study Kasparov's games, his chess \\"economy\\" is worth the classic.  Chapter 6 is to maneuver against the weakness. Naturally we won't attack an enemy's strong point. We have to use decoy, deception to outmaneuver him or induce him to make more weaknesses. (I think the modern \\"rule of two weaknesses\\" will prevail.)  I recall the modern chess books emphasize very much on the topic Exchange. Exchange in chess is positional. Nimzovich gave only 3 pages (in part 1) about this topic; maybe he didn't consider it as important.  In summary, many GMs and players praise his book. I think his \\"My System\\" is a collection of theories and discoveries he obtained and felt important during his time. He wrote it mainly for himself (for preparation), and in order to persuade sponsors so that he could get financial backup for the match of World Championship (like Alekhine's \\"My Best Games...\\").  We are fortunate that he released the book for publication, so we could learn something from him. But time has changed, and many generations have passed. Nimzovich's book is still a treasure.	2005-03-03

Three stars are for this book: <br />1) Good selection of games and clear diagrams. <br />2) Better analysis than those Schiller's books, (even the book is 15 years olds, I got '85 edition.) <br />3) Provide the complete games at the end of the book so we can see the turning points of the games. (Even so, if we want a complete collection of Fischer's games, Lou Hays' book is better, and then we would miss out the \\"expert\\" analysis, right? So this book is a good bridging stone.) <br />Most of Fischer's games in particular, and current and ex-champions and GMs in general, have some defining turn-points; especially when the players steer the games to the tactical aspects. Often than not, they prefer to keep the game in positional struggles, so the more patient and skillful players usually come out victorious after many long deep-thought moves. We don't see much \\"outrageous\\" moves in their (GM) games. However, when the combinations present, surely they grasp them and start the fireworks. That is what Pandolfini again wrote the book \\"One-Move Chess by the Champions\\". Fischer is a fearless attacker; therefore most of his games contain those \\"Outrageous\\" moves. Any 40-50 of Fischer's winning games from Hays' book can make some \\"Awesome Games of the Ultimate Chess Champion\\", or the like. With that abundance of impressive games, Fischer chose to write \\"My 60 Memorable Games\\", and he included some of his \\"memorable\\" losses too!!! <br />As we see, most books written about Fischer's games will have at least 1/3 of his games in \\"60 Memorable Games\\" (other 2/3 is to try avoid 'copycats'), and as we all know Fischer's analysis is always more superior. <br />Now, let's make some money, by buying Hays' book and using Fritz 8 (another small investment) to analyze Fischer's games. After that, with some good story-telling co-writers, we can produce \\"60 Winter Days in '64 U.S. Championship the Ultimate Chess Champion Created the Most Classical Game Record in the Most Prestigious Event of All Times\\", or something similar. <br />	2005-02-27

To be able to beat the champion in any category is a dream come true. Until the time Fischer forfeited his chess title, he had been considered the most fearsome player since Tal. With win/draw ratio of 2/1, he is the most dangerous player (as Mednis mentioned in the book, the ratio 1/1 is already very awesome.) Mednis took the 61 Fischer's losses since Fischer becoming the U.S. champion at fourteen, and grouped into four significant periods during Fischer's career. Then he created 8 tables to show the statistics on:<br /><br />1) How mush Fischer lost with White/Black pieces<br /><br />2) Who had better records on Fischer<br /><br />3) (Where) which countries had plus scores against Fischer<br /><br />4) Why Fischer lost<br /><br />5) What openings Fischer had problem with<br /><br />And on the last table, Mednis listed the games in chronological order (when) Fischer lost them.<br /><br />The stories begun of each part were insightful. The explanation begun and analysis during each game were good. The author now is a GM; he wrote the first edition (when he was an IM) after Fischer announced his retirement from chess (1974). Mednis is qualified to write the book and got fame when he beat Fischer one (1) game in 1962. This second edition from Dover, Mednis included an addition of the 1992 rematch between Fischer and Spassky. Fischer is still the better player, however comparing to the present tough competition Fischer would have to work really hard to maintain the expectation. Even so, he is still better than 95% of us (the chess mortals). (I guess, our chance to win is to wait until Fischer is 90 years old and he gives a 128 table simultaneous exhibition, and we remember to bring a portable Deep Jr. along.)	2005-02-27

Chernev's books are entertaining and well-prepared. Each book has a clear topic, Ex: \\"Logical Chess...\\", \\"Golden Dozen...\\" (now Twelve Great Chess Players), \\"Most Instructive...\\" (I failed to see the logical order of this book, however it's very educational to me). Chernev picked HIS twelve favorite chess masters and their masterpieces to compile this book. When we see the twelfth great is Nimzovich, we know this book is at a very high level. This book was written before Fischer became the World Champion; therefore other great players after him would not have a spot in this \\"platoon\\". (Sorry, Karpov, Kasparov, Anand.) I am surprised not to see some of brilliant players like Tarrasch, Schlechter, Reti and Keres in the book. Of course then we have to make the list of top 50. Even in the list of 50 best players of NBA and NFL, we could see some of our favorites omitted. The book biography shows how many collections Chernev had to sort through to pick his favorite games. Even so, the best game of Fischer and entire of his 11-0 \\"clean-sweep\\" of '64 tournament is not mentioned, not a single-one. Chernev's explanation often took the viewpoint of the victor. There are a few games not understandable (by me). In game 56, all Petrosian's pieces except the Queen are on the back rank, I wonder whether Pilnik could lose if he didn't make mistake by being overly aggressive. In the famous game 88 between Lasker and Capa, how could Lasker's Knights over power Capa's Bishops? Very strange. In the game 104, again Bernstein was trying too hard to win a Pawn from Capa, and then fell victim to a vulnerable back rank. And in the game 109, Chernev praised Capa's 10th move (un-developing the QB and locking it out for the next many moves) enthusiacally both in this book and in \\"The Most Instructive...\\" I don't understand it. Capa had 2 isolated and doubled Pawns on the Q-side. To compensate for this, Capa had two open files for his Rooks. With a packed center, I guessed Janowsky could play conservatively (of course, it's \\"un-sportmanship\\" for the player with the white pieces) and hold a draw. I tend to agree with GM Yermo in \\"The Road to Chess Improvement\\" that Janowsky eagerly played for the win and over-extended his position.  Anyway, Chernev cared very much about his books, and always made his books entertaining. Each player in this book had about 10 of his (where are the famous female champions?) typical games. It's good to have a collection for many famous players in one place, so we can compare their styles to others and through the time by themselves. The stories in the player introduction and game introduction are valuable and instructive.	2005-02-24

The Euler formular relating the integers and the prime numbers is so beautifully derived. How could some people be so genius? Then Reimann used his intuition to postulate and extend it to cover the complex variables. Since the pre-Euclidean era until the present time, the distribution of prime numbers always fascinates the researchers. The application of prime numbers is still very important in secured commmunication. The proof of Reimann Hypothesis (or dis-proof it) will reveal the secret of prime number distribution. So important is this hypothesis that 1 million-dollar reward has been offered for it. <br />Author's (first and) interesting analogy of the calculation of the over-hang of the playing cards and the harmonic series (which is divergent) trigged me to buy the book. I could not understand (only 5% so far) all his explanations, but the stories and discoveries associated with the RH are so beautiful. To understand the book requires lots of thinkings, however to enjoy the stories only requires a cup of warm tea, a sofa and a pillow (a blanket if you're in a cold weather.) <br />If you read this far, you must have loved math as much as I do... ;-)	2005-02-24

When Chernev chose 60 games to summarize Capa's endgame skills, they must be very clear and instructive. Many GMs agreed that Capa is a master of positional chess and an endgame artist. He made the games so \\"simple\\" (after we see how the games unfolded) that they look \\"magical\\". There were many endgames that he saw so deep (and intuitively) that during the transitional phase his opponents thought they got the upperhand. Then a few more actual moves into the endings, they realized that they had been outplayed (see the games of Marshall and Tartakover). His positional understanding was ahead of his opponents' time. He placed his pieces at the most optimal squares that when the game was transferred into the ending, either he had won some material, or his strong position could force a trade to his favor, or his attack was so strong that his opponent had to give up something. This gave us his masterful endgame technique. This book actually has Capa's full games. Chernev gave explanations for the whole games, however displayed a break or transition where the games entered the ending phases. <br />After many Chernev's books, it is obvious that Capa is his chess hero (from Golden Dozen, Most Instructive and Logical Chess...) Compared this book to his others, I noticed three improvements (actually 2 1/2, ;-)). First the book is organized in chronological order (Surprise!); so I could learn how progressively Capa's technique changed (of course, it also depended on how strong his opponents were.) Second, there is an index to show what types of endings his games were. It's good for reference. And last, finally Chernev used the algebraic notation! However, he still used the long algebraic way (Ng1-f3) instead of the short one (Nf3). (I guessed, evolution takes many steps to perfect, ;-). Excuse me, master Chernev, you're still one of my favorite authors.) <br />This book gave actual games, so it's very practical. It prepares and directs intermediate level (like myself) what to look for and how to drive the game into similar positions. This book is published by Dover, therefore the price is very reasonable. <br />	2005-02-24

Da Vinci Code and Manchurian Candidate in one.	I didn't buy the book because there is no chess game in it. I got one from a local library. The main and background stories are interesting. There were too much and too good details that made me suspicious. The progress from newborn Fischer to his trouble time in Japan are all in there. About half of the book is about the confrontation of the '72 championship match. Except the first chapter I read fully, I only scanned quickly to the part there was chess or interesting details. Then to the page 306 (5 pages before the end!), author dropped the bomb. Fischer's biological father was not his mom's ex-husband. All I knew about Fischer before were: he had a mom and a sister (who taught him chess), and his mom was a nurse and had more other skills. Here the author slightly mentioned that FBI having some investigation on Fischer's mom and suspecting her as Soviet agent! Wow, that's chess version of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code (I haven't read his book, but watched the DVD version and some documentation on History Channel.) <br />Then the author provided an Appendix, which gave the more detail about Fischer's parents plus a photocopy of FBI document. The government suspected there was some secretive plan that was why his mom kept pursuing for Fischer to become the world champion. Now, that's The Manchurian Candidate. They could not account for all her time (and his father's) during their stay in Moscow and other countries. <br />I don't know how much to believe, but the review title expresses how I feel. <br />Besides the 'exotic' details, I think the chess part is good. Because there is no chess game, I am willing to settle with a used book with 1/5 of the cover price.	2005-02-24

In this book, the author used a style similar to Sun Tzu's in The Art of War. Vukovic tried to summarize why some attacks work and some don't. He provided some concrete evidences where the attack is successful and some where the intuition takes a major role. Without intuition and imagination, I doubt we have many masterpieces from Tal, Fischer, Kasparov or Alekhine.  When we say \\"attack\\", the modern chess has two main goals: attacking the King and attacking a weakness (piece or square). Vukovic is all about the first goal. The modern chess somehow inter-connects the two goals, the attacker uses one goal to distract the defender's attention in order to start the other, and vice versa. The attack in the enemy King is more exciting, because checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess. A win is a win, but a direct attack on the King (together with some pretty sacrifice) seems like a slam-dunk while winning materially with a pawn promotion seems like a lay-up. Vukovic's writing was very detailed and authoritative. He gave some guidelines on how to attack an uncastled King as well as a castled King. With each King's position, he showed some weaknesses for where the attacker to aim at.  The chapter about the 'classic' bishop sacrifice saved me a game. I played with the black pieces against a strong player. I had two Knights on d7 and e7 in some French Defense. Suddenly I saw my opponent lifted his King Bishop from d3 and slammed hard into my h7 Pawn (I had castled King-side). I was careful to preserve my two Knights during the game (I was lucky to scan thru Vukovic's book before). However, I was shocked when I saw he did such a sacrifice. It took me 5 minutes to double-check my defense; I could not see the forced mate. Finally, I put my reputation on the line (often I resign when the situation is hopeless or checkmate is foreseeable) to play on, and planned to turn down the King when a mate-in-three or four became obvious. I just wanted him to show me the ($$$) checkmate. There was no mate. With a trade-up to my advantage, a Bishop for a pawn (lost at h7), my opponent lost in a late middle game when my major pieces coming down to his King-castle. A few weeks later, my opponent showed his recent game with the 'classic\\" bishop sacrifice, and this time his sacrifice worked!!! So the knowledge on this 'sac' helped me save our game and also helped my opponent to sharpen his tactics for the Kingside attack. The story didn't end here. About two years later, I did the same 'classic' bishop sac and due to my lack of calculation depth I messed up the order of the Queen, Bishop and Pawn moves I lost the game. When I got home, entering the move sequence back into my CM8000 and it showed me that the sac was sound, just I didn't follow thru correctly.  When I play a weaker player (about 200-point difference), when there is a decision about attacking a weakness or a King, no doubt that attacking the King is the chosen one. A few pawns sac or a piece sac to open his Castle is not a difficult choice. An attack on a weakness (square or piece), the opponent can ignore it; but an attack on his King always catches his attention, and the reply is almost forced. Often the persistent attack prevails.  One time my opponent, playing white, early in the opening, maneuvered his Queen to d2 (blocking his QB) and g5 in order to steal my g7 pawn; and he challenged me to give up that pawn. He made up his mind to win that pawn; therefore I swung my QN to prepare an attack on the Queenside (as a decoy). After capturing the g7-pawn, he retreated his Queen back to d2 and castled Kingside (naturally). As soon as he castled Kingside, I castled Queenside and brought both Rooks to the g-file and attacked his King, sacrificing another pawn along the way. His QB blocked by his Queen could not help. He gave up instead of exchanging his Queen for a Knight and a Rook.  This proves the above assumption that an attack on the King seems more powerful than an attack somewhere else. Vukovic's book shows how to conduct an exciting attack on the enemy King. So far, examples on the \\"classic' Bishop sac have given me some good experience. The attack on the castled King also works for me, and against me! There were quite a few times my opponents (at least two) know that I automatically castled Kingside, especially with black pieces. They prepared the attack with pawns to h4 and/or g4. As soon as I castled K-side, they castled Q-side or lifted the King to 2nd rank, and then the Q-Rook swung over to K-side to work in unison with other Rook. My King hit the dust soon afterward. And of course I too had been on either side of an \\"unbearable\\" attack on the uncastled King.  Vukovic gave many many more examples of the 'slam-dunk' King-attack.  P.S.: I can't depart if not mentioning: Yes, I have been also on either side of a \\"horrible\\" Dragon Sicilian, which Vukovic showed in chapter 'the attack on the fianchettoed castling position'. Chess is a game of give-and-take, however checkmate is better to give than to take... ;-)	2005-02-22

My first chess program was Sargon, running on Apple Computer. It was very impressive and beat me easily. My next two Sargon programs (II and III) were for Commodore 64. I guessed even my Fidelity Chess Computer ran on one of these versions of Sargon. I was always curious about the internal working mechanism of these programs. I tried to study the machine codes (6502 and 6510) of Sargon and Sargon III, but gave up about 10% into the process. I found this book from my school library, but at that time my programming experience was weak and had no tools to test the program in the book. Later, on the job, I found some discarded Z80 motherboards, and I was back to study this Sargon program. It is a very good way to understand how the internal program works. Now I have studied two more programs GNU Chess 5.00 and Phalanx, Sargon was still a \\"good-date\\" to remember. Sargon was written for micro-machine when memory was at the premium; therefore the code was in machine code. It took lots of efforts to go through it but it is worth it. With high-speed CPUs and plenty of memory newer computers provided, most programs are now in C or higher-level languages. These higher-level languages help a lot to speed through the programs. I have a copy of Sargon book. It is one of the historical documents of chess playing programs in particular and of artificial intelligence in general. <br />One more point, Sargon was the first program written for microcomputer to compete with other more dedicated and/or specialized chess engines, and Sargon had won some honorable prizes. If you can afford one for your chess program library, keep one. <br />	2005-02-22

For many decades after WW II, he was known as one of the leading chess theorists. For this set of books, there are: <br />Volume 1: about piece plays and exchanges. <br />Volume 2: about pawn structures and the center. <br />Volume 3: about attacking on the wings, where one has superior position like pawn majority or weakness and subjected to a minority attack. (How Yin-Yang can chess be?) <br />I found in a local library the first two volumes, and like them very much. For some time, I had a few chess books. In the openings, I have: Horowitz', Korn's and Fine's. For the endings, I have Fine's. I also have Tartakover's 500 master games. I could not find any GOOD books about theory in middle games. Then I got the books of Chernev (Most Instructive Chess Games...) and John Love's (Positional Ideas...). They teach about the middle games. Love's is good but not enough details, and I could not follow the logic (arrangement) of Chernev's. Finally I found this impressive work of Pachman. I know I must have Pachman's books in my collection. One day, I found at a local used chess bookstore these books. The curious thing was I here found only the last two volumes. I grasped them at once and knew that my collection was still incomplete. A few years ago, I found this compact version of Pachman. I got it, knowing that in this book the new editor dropped out lots of games. I agreed with other reviewers, Pachman took great care to select good games for his books. The new single volume book lost some of its value. It is still good enough to carry to a tournament as reference book, however to fully appreciate Pachman's effort, only the complete 3-volume set can do its justice. I plan to get the first volume to complete my collection, and the compact one is for reference. <br />The arrangement of Pachman's work makes lots of sense. For tactical (easiest) chess, the piece play has the dominant roles as we see sub-1500 players often do. At the super-1800 level, the players begins to play positionally (more difficult), work with pawn structure and center more. After that, if both players are at higher level, they will work on the dynamic elements (most difficult): space superiority, square weakness, development lead, positional sacrifice, etc. <br />Of course, this superficial opinion is from my only sub-1700 level, for sure the higher rank reader will think differently. <br />This book was written in the pre-Fischer and Tal era, so the games didn't have much the dynamical aspects of the late 20th century chess. Even so, the theory and application of Pachman's work still find its characteristics in Nunn, Burgess, Karpov, Kasparov's chess and writings. <br /> <br />	2005-02-22

First, the book is cheaper than the cost of a guitar lesson. <br />Second, the CD enclosed with the book is a wonderful tool to assist self-learner to follow the examples. <br /> <br />Here are a few points I observe: <br /> <br />Chapter 4 teaches strumming the 4/4 signatures, and also how to insert the up-strokes between the down-strokes to accompany different songs, then adding in some syncopation. There is a shortcoming with this book, the strumming playing over all strings, compared to the Idiot's Guide to guitar by Noad. In Noad's, the single-bass notes (in Rumba and Beguine) are the main characteristics to make the syncopation interesting. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 is the BEST one. It teaches the double-stop and playing in position techniques. For years, I only knew how to play the melody on the first four frets and open strings. (At that position I was only comfortably playing with two keys G and D.) I was so impressed to see the pros playing up the neck. I had no idea how they do that. This chapter gave me a VERY clear explanation on how each position is best suited for different key. Not only that, it explains how to transpose to a new key by moving the left hand to new position while fingering as if it was still at the old key. (If it's not clear, please re-read that chapter.) <br /> <br />Chapter 8 teaches about the power chords, which have been taken out the middle notes so they are neither major nor minor chords. When I practiced the songs \\"I can't stop loving you\\" of Ray Charles and \\"Always on my mind\\" of Willie Nelson, if I paid attention to the bass strings only, I actually used the power chords explained in this chapter. <br /> <br />The problem I have is in the part \\"bending\\" of chapter 9. The best I could bend is only 1/2 step. I have no idea how the authors could bend the whole step and mentioned that some 2-step bends are possible (?). Maybe I didn't practice enough to have stronger fingers, or the guitar I use of the classical one with nylon strings. I know the steel is easier to bend; and maybe the electric guitar is much easier to bend, right? I hope so, because the examples the authors included in the CD sound so beautiful. <br /> <br />The next two chapters (10 and 11) are those I'm not ready yet, but they sound very nice in the CD. The next chapter 12 is about folk style and I could follow somehow. The last useful (my favorite) chapter is about classical (13). It gives a short but good enough explanation of two different styles. Also in chapter about Rock, it provides many boxes for playing solo. The main box is the pentatonic minor scale. I recalled from some other music books mentioning that the pentatonic scale is used in many folk and Oriental songs. I tried it and found out it really works. The song I tried was \\"Sukiyaki.\\" <br /> <br />The rest of the book (6 chapters) is about how to buy and care for the guitar (which I feel no need for now) and top ten lists of guitarists and guitars. <br /> <br />Considering: the enclosed CD, playing in position lesson (plus transposing keys), basic strumming, classical and pentatonic scale, I think the book is worth the price. If you could save some money with the used book, then it's good too. This is a small book (350 pages) which covers a lot of topics, and for beginner. Yes, sometimes the lesson goes too fast. However, this book is for self-tutoring with many examples in the CD. You can work at your own pace, and with help from a friend is excellent. With more details and style (like jazz), the book could hit 500 pages easily, then how much is the book price? How comfortably is it to handle the book? I don't mind to replace the last six chapters by more details and examples, but the number of pages is reasonable enough. <br />	2005-02-16

They illustrated how to use each piece (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn) where and where most efficiently. Each stage of chess game (Opening, Middle game and Endgame) has its own set of maxims. There is a chapter about Exchange. And there are four more chapters about the topics that sometimes I feel I understand what they are and many times I just can't tell what they really are. Those topics are: Tactical Play, Positional Play, Combinations and Strategy. Each maxim in the book has a master game or endgame study to go with it for clarification. The final chapter is about a philosophy of chess, which has no games. The author had a wishful thinking that Fischer would come back and dominate chess again. The book was written in 1978. Fifteen years later, there comes another similar book, \\"The Tao of Chess.\\" Comparing \\"Tao\\" to \\"Maxims\\", the former is about fifteen percent as good as the latter. Maxims passes the test of time and is good enough for beginning to immediate level.	2005-02-01

The author collected about a hundred (I didn't really count them) of Fischer's games, together with some chess problems and some GM and master games to draw the parallel between Fischer's play and chess great players'. The author grouped the games in endgames, middle-games and openings. Fischer had many outstanding endgames, but also there were a few games he was lucky to draw it because his opponents missed the wins. There too were some games Fischer couldn't win because of lack of experience (the next time around he would win convincingly after reviewing the theory). The part of middle-games showed how much better and stronger-will he was compared to his opponents. About the openings we all know Fischer had a narrow repertoire, however his is deeper than anyone before and after his time. There had been some systems he was not lucky with, but he stuck to them throughout to prove his points. Then by his most important match, the championship match with Spassky, he sprung out the Queen Pawn opening, the Alekhine and some he seldom employed. And he won! There were not many drawn or lost games of Fischer's in this book, but they are instructive. (And it's good for us to know.)<br /><br />The games in the book were not deeply analyzed but there are many of them. With a computer programs it is easy to improve the analyses. As the title said, \\"The chess of Bobby Fischer.\\" It's all about the chess skills or the psychology that Fischer experienced during the games. For more of the personal aspect, the book by Gufeld is a good complement to this book.	2005-02-01

For almost half of a century, this book \\"Modern Chess Openings\\" is the bible for players in the U.S. Only the rare book of Horowitz, \\"Chess Openings: Theory and Practice\\" is more authoritative. The edition I have is the 12th one, by Walter Korn. It is divided into four chapters: King Pawn Opening, Queen Pawn Opening, Indian Defense and Flank Opening. <br />The King Pawn chapter has all known openings but the most covered are the three about Ruy Lopez, French and Sicilian. Even the less known Two Knight Defense also gave me much trouble when my opponents use it. This book is helpful when I need to come back and study. And how about the Evan Gambit where Kasparov used successfully against some GMs? About the Queen Pawn Openings, if we recall 32 out of 34 games in the famous Alekhine-Capablanca match used it. Then Botvinnik used Dutch and Slav; Kasparov, Catalan; Fischer, Benoni; etc. They are all here. The Indian Defense is a derivative from the Queen Pawn Opening, however it evolves so much and becomes so important that it starts another category. The last section is for any openings where White does not start with either King or Queen Pawn. And the English and Bird are Sicilian and Dutch with one extra move in hand. And the Reti's can transpose to almost anything. <br />This book is important for who wants to prepare for tournaments. It is a collective effort of many contributors. If I could understand and memorize 10% of all the important lines in the book, I would be in good shape for any tournament. <br />I looked in Borders/Amazon site for where to insert this review, for my edition is 12th. edition. Here I only found Walter Korn, editions: 9th, 11th, and 13th. Now, that's really odds [;-)]. So I chose to put this review here. Either I use to my 12th edition or something about the 14th ed. by De Firmian, but his book does not look as impressive as Korn 12th edition. Maybe there is too much blank space in the pages of the 14th ed. Just a cosmetic factor. I know the De Firmian's is more up-to-date and more materials. <br />	2005-01-30

This book is translated from Russian, so it must pass the test of time. Averbakh used very concise analysis. He gave us, immediate level, a tool to understand the endgames. <br />It is essential for players from beginning to intermediate levels. After a chapter about the basic mating the lone King with minimal force, it introduces the standard combats between various pieces. It explains where a forcible win is guaranteed where it's not. <br />Then come two chapters of piece fighting against Pawns: a Rook or a minor piece versus Pawn (it's hard to believe that in some positions a single Pawn can beat the Rook!) and the Royalty versus Pawn. <br />After that there are two important chapters. One is about the fighting between two minor pieces where one side has one or two extra Pawns. The part about the opposite color bishops is very instructive, some case is winnable and some not. There is so much to learn in the next chapter, which explains the Rook plus Pawn Ending. As Capablanca put it: Rook and Pawn Ending is one of the most important endings. When the Rooks join the battle, sometimes they are the last pieces, understanding this type ending can help to win or draw it. <br />In the second half of the book, Averbakh used practical endgames from master games to emphasize what he explained in the last three chapters: Royalty and Pawns, Minor Pieces and Pawns, and Rooks and Pawns. He analyzed where some masters failed to save or win the game. <br />I highly recommend this book at new or used price. I guarantee your endgame knowledge (same level as mine) will improve. <br />	2005-01-30

As mentioned in some of my other reviews, this Nunn's book seems like a combination of Chernev's two books: Logical Chess Move by Move and the Most Instructive Chess Games Ever Played. Nunn's book is better organized because it groups the games and strategies in game stages: opening, middle-game and ending. <br />The main principles of openings like: bring out the pieces, king-safety, center control, etc. are used to illustrate part 1. <br />Part 3 demonstrates the methods of handling the endings: advantage of the passed pawn, active king play, and active rook in the endgame. <br />The most exciting part is part 2: the middle-games. To play attack is easier than to play defense. First Nunn's provides us with many strategies to start and maintain the initiative and attack. Then he supplies us with some methods to defense and wait for the moment to take over the initiative to start our own counter-attack. Then if the position is not ready, Nunn shows us the positional play, placing the pieces and pawns at the most optimal positions so that when opportunity comes they can spring out for attack, or detect the weaknesses in opponent's position to start our attack there, or repair our weakness or sacrifice it and start our attack where the opponent is weaker. This last (positional) part is similar to Chernev's Most Instructive Games. <br />Nunn explains the idea behind move by move like Chernev's Logical Chess, except he did not bother to repeat or invent new ways to explain the same moves that he did before, very considerate he was. It saved our time and our esteem. <br />Like he wrote in the introduction, it is difficult to select games in 10 years span to illustrate modern chess strategy, which has more than 100 years history. In those games, the GMs know as much as his opponents. To successfully and completely carry the plan, they have to out-fox their opponents. They use all the experience, skills and sometimes deception to steer the game into the position that is favorable to their style. The games are in high quality. <br />Each game begins with a paragraph of introduction, which tells us what to look for during the game. During the game, there are lots of explanation and some important variations. At the end, there are summary and lessons we can draw from the game.	2005-01-30

I have 4 or 5 books about Fischer, but this one is different. It shows Fischer, the person. Seven contributors recalled their personal contacts with Fischer. Their encounters were first-hand, so their stories are truer. There are no deep chess analyses in this book, however they are the important games during Fischer's career. This is no problem, because I can find the analyses in other books or magazines, or even from chess programs. The interviews, stories, experience, observation that the authors shared enlighten me many points about Fischer. He is incredible, demanding bunch of money to play the championship with Spassky; then rejecting more money when having to defend his title. He turned down large sum of money when asked to write a book about the match. How could he rack up long strings of wins without allowing a single draw along? And these games were against the GMs. This book also has many good pictures along his exciting career. A nice article written by Unzicker near the end showed how fairly Fischer treated chess-fellows. This book could a short historical document illustrating the rise and fall of a chess titan.	2005-01-30

It sounds cool, however the details were not provided. The author gave a single line where he should have made or hope for, but in moment of excitement he played an incorrect move and his opponent outplayed him in different single-line variation. Some lost games were due to his lack of experience or preparation, he confessed. The analysis was single-minded. As other reviewers wrote: errors, typos, and faulty analysis are many. With word processor and chess program available, the book is not up to standard. 5-6 USD for a used book is a better investment if you want a collection of chess mistakes.	2005-01-25

I bought this book because of one of my constant opponents played the Dragon exclusively (only recently he began to increase his repetoire with Najdorf and other Sicilian.) Overall he got a plus score on me. I also read some games of Fischer beating the Dragon (I feel good), then Sierawan poked fun of the Dragon (feel better), and Karpov killed Korchnoi's Dragon (feel the best). Then Kasparov is successful with the Dragon. Now I have mixed feelings about the Dragon (together with bad experience in the Dragon, I lost many games with either color!!!). I hoped to find a book to improve my score, And this book is not a long term work. It could provide a list of plans to use when you play white or black, but not deep analysis, only good for quick fix when playing speed chess. Buy book from GM writers is better choice, they have their record to back it up. 7.50 USD is OK for this book.	2005-01-25

Caro-Kann is a solid defense. Against a dangerous attacking player like Tal, Botvinnik used almost exclusively Caro-Kann as black to combat Tal's king pawn opening. Botvinnik almost resorted all to French defense before the two matches with Tal. On the very first game of the first match, Botvinnk lost with his French defense, for the rest of the match he used Caro-Kann against all king pawn opening. The result was not in his favor (1 win, 2 loses and 3 draws), but better than the French. For the second match, in the first half, with Caro-Kann, Botvinnik got the score: 1 win, 2 loses, and 2 draws. He switched to the French and lost at once. Caro-Kann it was for the rest of the match, 1 win and 3 drawns.<br /><br />I played the Caro-Kann (before learning the statistics above) to avoid the troubled QB in the French, while the Sicilian requires lots of risks and fighting spirit. I got a good record against one player, he then researched and prepared some special line for me. Before I played him again, I played two other opponents whom the first player shared this special line with, they both beat me! The line was: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 Bf5 4 g4 Bg6 5 h4 h6 6 e6! To see the correct reply at moves 4 or 5, please use the chess database to look for games of Bronstein and Petrosian.<br /><br />When I saw \\"Complete Defense To King Pawn Openings\\" and on the very first page of chapter 1, it has the diagram of black reply to white's e4 with c6; I bought the book instantly. It \\"was\\" about Caro-Kann and \\"complete\\" (???). What else could I ask for more? I was disappointed, it has no mention of 3 ... Bf5. It's not worth the price. The book is just a collection of Caro-Kann games, with some well-thought and some not so well-thought ideas of the author. And your job is to sort them out. 7 USD for the book is reasonable price.<br /><br />Besides the Cardoza book's content is not high in quality, the format is not so good either. The two column format like Gambit book is much better. The font used in Cardoza book is hard too read, too large. I hope Cardoza will improve the book content and adjust some page format soon.<br /><br />As a departing gift, my shortest (lost) game in Caro-Kann was 6 moves.

He spent lots of time to research and write his books. This book shows how much he cares for and loves chess. Only with extreme love, anyone can take time to explain move by move of any game; he has to fight boredom and repetition. This book is good but not comparable to his \\"Golden Dozen\\" and \\"Most Instructive Games\\" due to the difficult task of clarifying every move. I planned to give this book 4 1/2 stars because his other books were so instructive. Then another factor (see point A below) reduces it to 4 stars. Chess plan and strategy require many moves to carry out. If we break a sequence of many related moves into many single moves and explain one by move, the idea may be lost or confusing. We are grateful that Chernev took the task. If every move has a paragraph of note, a normal length game may take up to 20 pages; this has a negative effect on intermediate level (such as me); we have short attention span. (Point A). Because of this Chernev chose short games to illustrate his book. His book has 3 parts: 1) King Attack (average length = 20 moves), 2) Queen pawn game (25 moves) and 3) Master games (35 moves.) As expected, a \\"successful\\" King-side attack would be over quickly. A queen pawn game take longer than the king pawn game. For player with lack of patience as myself, the short game examples hurt a lot. With time game, I often work hard to find good move, and sometimes gain minor advantage, from that on I try hard and look long for a quick win while burning out the clock, the opponent wisely uses his clock and keep the position complicated. The time pressure cost me the game. To combat this bad habit, hope to win short game, I sometimes come back to Alekhine, Petrosian, Botvinnik's games to prove to myself that even champions just could not ask for more than what the position could yield. <br />In summary, Chernev's love for chess is obvious. To write this book he spent lots of time and efforts. To avoid some difficultieshe chose not very representative games (short ones). As long as we can see some of this short-coming, this book is helpful. One more thing: due to lack of computer-aided analysis, it's not fair to compare this book to Nunn's \\"Move-by-move...\\"	2005-01-25

Kotov is exceptional trainer.  I read the book a few times, but recently the chapter about defending a difficult position stands out.

I read three of his, including this one.  The Pirc, for the benefit of the doubt, is so advanced that I could not understand.  The Rules of Thumb, so general that I could find from other books.  This book, only the first thin section is about Fischer, the rest is like a condensed version of chess magazines.  It takes only 10 minutes to read all about Fischer in this book. I recommend the Gufeld's book about Fischer, deeper, more stories and games of Fischer's.	2004-05-17

This is an impressive book, I think the size is equivalent to Polgar's book; but at a much better paper quality.<BR>a) The organization is excellent, very easy to follow.<BR>b) The explaination is rather clear.<BR>c) Benko is a master in endgame, so the section of endgame will improve players at least 250 points.<BR>d) Many many games of Benko's throughout his career so it helps to understand how a GM progresses.<BR>e) The part about openings is very good.<BR>f) Lots of pictures of quality prints show that Benko put much effort in it and cared for his product.<br />One complain, the retail price is 45 USD!  Are we chess-amateurs related to Donald Trump or what?  I didn't buy it yet, but read about 20 minutes at Borders.  Will include this book in my library by a used book at a better price.<br />Now back to the title, maybe I'm too unexperienced to follow Alburt's books. I read three of Alburt's books and could not understand clearly any one them.  (One about Pirc, one about Rule of Thumb, One about 3 days w/ Fischer; all three of them are comparable to Benko's, maybe 50 will do.  My limited experiece anyway.)  The last one sounds interesting, but after some tens pages, the subject seemed not relevant to the book's title.  I might try Alburt's books again.<BR>However, if you can (I can't) afford Benko's book, get it.  It's hard to find quality chessbooks nowadays.	2004-05-17

As Keene mentioned in his preface, this is a collection of his writing throughout the years, so the book has no clear title, just Keene on chess.  His work covers from the simple piece's moves, pieces' name to advance topic like: the positional chess, strategies and the debatable &quot;Who is the greatest chess player of all times?&quot;  This reminds me of many books of Chernev's, except Keene's is all about real chess, while Chernev's has quite a few fictonal stories.  Some sections in Keene's are very good: in the Indian Defenses, the attacking methods/targets, choosing a chess hereos, fighting against/for the IP, so on.<BR>Good book in immediate and advance level; the so basic chess for beginner takes away the four star rating.  I gave it a 3 1/2 stars.	2004-04-09

My chess tactics is weak; therefore I'm often banking on my experience with positional chess. Chernev's Most Instructive Chess Game ... is always my favorite. It taught me a lot about positional chess. One thing about Chernev's book, I could not understand its arrangement, not in chronological order, not in any particular themes, it's hard to remember (as a checklist during a game for: what can I do at this stage? what to do next if he exchanges his bishop for my outpost knight? etc.) Then I bought Nunn's Move-by-Move. Nunn's book is good and difficult. First his book is arranged in order of opening, middlegame and endgame; very nice. Second it's good because Nunn selected games of the \\"heavy-weight\\" players in the last 20 years or so. At this level the GMs try to carry out his plan while disrupting opponent's plan, so their plays are at very high level and sometimes very deceptive. That makes the book great and difficult (for my level).  Then one day I had to choose between Romero's Creative Chess Strategy and Marovic's Secrets of Positional Chess to buy. It's a hard choice because the words Secrets and Positional sounded so attractive. Now I am glad that I bought Romero's book. Together with other reviewers here and my own recollections, Marovic's book is more difficult and has many unfinished games. With comments like: +/=, =/=, -/=, at my level, it's like giving me the key (? ;-)) to space shuttle and ask me to fight around the earth a few rounds, bring it home safely and don't forget to look out the window to enjoy the view of the Grand Canyon and the Great Wall and Pyramid, and of course I have to pay for the trip and never have a flight training before. (I will buy Marovic's when I can understand it.)  Romero's theme arrangement is rather logical. The first three chapters are about Pawn structure, Space and Center; even it's hard to which order the Pawn Structure (more modern than other two) should appear. The next 4 chapters are about Bishop-pair, Blockade,IQP, and Control of Squares. Should the chapters about Blockade and IQP be chapters 4 and 5? Are they related to Pawn and Space? Not very clear because in the IQP chapter it mentions about the B-pair again and the Knight-pair (haven't read about this often since the games of Tchigorin and Reshevsky). And chapter 8 is about Attacking a Weak Center. Chapters 10 and 11 are about exchanging pieces and sacrifice. I think they should come after chapters 9 (Open and Semi-open files) and 12 (Knight-outpost and Rook-Knight Coordination). Exchange is when we want to improve our piece positions or to remove opponent's favorable pieces before or during an attack or defense; sacrifice is the last resort to achieve that goal, a minus in materials could spell disaster in a long run. Why doesn't chapter 13 (Dead Bishop) follow the B-pair chapter? Why is chapter 14 (Lack of Communication) away from chapters of Center and Blockade? Then after that is a chapter (15) about Attacking without Rules when a desperate win is needed or intuition suggests. At last, a chapter about positions where depending of taste, experience and skills, the GMs created. In those the normal considerations of mortal/low-level players like us fail to appreciate. Whichever side we take, we would lose to a player with 200-points higher.  Above is my personal opinion about Romero's book. He has very good reason to arrange it that way. I just hope I could create a checklist of what to do during the course of the game stage-by-stage.  Romero's is more logical than Chernev's, better for my level than Nunn's. It has lots of explanation which is very helpful, better than a bunch of variations and ended with +, -,  =, which are comprehensible to me.  Correction: it's a 5 star book.	2004-02-17

I was lucky that my school still has those old Chernev's chess books; strange that it has more old than new ones (???, butget cuts).  Anyway these Chernev's books are in high quality.  He and Reinfeld were the two most chess teachers and authors.  Reinfeld, as I recalled from memory, was a stronger player but Chernev's books are always better.  When they combined their work, we as benefitors have the best of both worlds.  This book has lots of facts, many valuable stoties, games, and puzzles.  At the time when annotation was not deliberately shared, this book was good.  Now we expect more from the authors to share their thoughts and secrets.  A little more work then it can get a 5-star rating.	2004-02-15

Yes, this book is good; and is a former incarnation of the Chess Companion.  Therefore it is given 4 stars, as 3 1/2 for the Chess Companion.  The games are good, even not as high standard as the games in the following decades later.  The chess endings are very helpful.  Many chess themes are very clear.  But the story part is not great if you have high expectation.  At least they are localized to one half of the book, imagine if those stories were inter-leaving with the real chess.  I still don't know how to organinze those stories in a book.  Like their current leading part of the book causes some distraction to the good chess to follow; however, if they were in the last half, then we or at least I would expect more exciting (and real-life) chess stories.  I just got some idea.  The book has two front covers and two halves and one is upside-down of other.  To read from one end, it's the real chess games; turn it up-side down, and read from the back, it's the fairy tale chess.  Let the publisher worry about how to print it.  We are just the chess audience...  ;-)	2004-02-14

I read it about 15 yrs ago, and have had quite a few fairy tales to tell friends.  But now looking back, I don't understand why those &quot;nice&quot; stories got into the books.  Don't get me wrong; those stories have great value, high quality, and very interesting; are very good for magazine.  But they are the leading sections for the real chess following?  However, if they don't get into this book or similar Chernev's books, then where would they be ever appeared in book forms?  How many chess books about the chess prodigy, chess computer, and chess stuff that we thought we could read some good games from those books and got none at all?  At least this one provided some games.  The real chess part is very very good.  The part about famous chess games, great endgame, chess problems, and more are very exceptional.  3 1/2 stars for this book:  2 1/2 for the chess part, 1 for the none-game part.  Sometimes we have to raise our expectation.	2004-02-14

It's the PUBLISHER's FAULT!  How could this nice work be packaged in such a lousy paperback format?  And the price is very cheap (or very reasonable too.)  I certainly MUST NOT complain about the price of the book here!  I wish the book had at least the paper and cover quality (maybe 15% more costly but worth it) like the book &quot;Tal-Botvinnik 1960.&quot;  As you see, the FORMAT and PRICE make me misjudge this book.<BR>I learned my things from the authors' store-telling and endnotes.  Two typical examples: Anand-Karpov (19??) (I can't recall the year but will fill it in when I remember.  See, I told you, I need the book for my collection badly), Anand made an &quot;in-between move&quot; and caught Karpov's supprise and won the game.  And second, the game between Kasparov-Anand (19??), after winning the game, Kasparov said, &quot;I used only 2 minutes for the first 20 moves, but had spent 24 hours for preparation the day before.&quot;  That says how Karparov is like; and serious players should take notice.<BR>For now, I can only read the book from a local library.	2003-12-07

Did Fine really work on this edition or someone else?<BR>The only improvement is the algebraic notation.  But the format is not so good and errors are plentiful.<BR>Format: I always prefer the two (narrow) columm page format over the one wide column.  (For example: Kotov's &quot;Think Like a Grandmaster&quot;)  It helps to focus to the main idea when the sentences are localized to a small area.  But this book &quot;The Idea ...&quot; can't use this format.  I can never remember the &quot;main&quot; &quot;ideas&quot; of those paragraphs even trying many times.  The 2nd ed. is better, it arranges the diagrams side-by-side, it makes it easier for the reader to compare the positions and ideas.<BR>Now, the errors.  EX: Diagrams 36B and 36F miss some pawns.  And the graphics look aweful, period.  Some move sequences in the 2nd ed. having numbers wrong are carried to the 3rd ed.<BR>Now, the consistency.  The new ed. uses the chess symbols to represent the pieces within the sentences; many times it uses the old style like B or N.  The old ed. used &quot;Defense&quot; and &quot;Center&quot;, the new one used &quot;Defence&quot; and &quot;Centre.&quot;  On page 51, the line 13 from the bottom of the left column, it used &quot;centre&quot;; and right on top of the word, it used &quot;center&quot;!<BR>How do I find these discrepancies?

The topic is interesting, the book title is impressive.  After the first two chapters, the rest looked like Greek to me.  The next three chapters are the \\"meat\\" of the book.  Finally last week, after 18 years of \\"soul-searching\\", it begins to make sense to me.  Between then and now, I revisited the book at least 5-6 more times.  Difficult book!  There are two reasons that this book threw me off.  Dr. Botvinnik used lots of Greek letters to represent his formulars: alpha, beta, psi, theta, sigma, tau, rho, phi, delta, pi, sigma, etc. (See what I meant.)  If that was not enough, he added in the \\"complex number representation\\" as a \\"bonus.\\"  That was the first reason.  The second was the way he wrote those expressions, I thought they were \\"well-known continuous functions\\" in math or science.  Most of them are NOT.  They are binary functions, either have values of 1 or 0; which now can be represented as Boolean math in standard programming language.<BR>The main way to use his evaluation expressions is with the assumption there is always an \\"attack\\" provided an material exchange.  This was applicable for tactical chess; while for state-of-the-art program, the positional evaluation is more involved.<BR>The first is about the historical match between the USA-USSR programs, which resulted in favor of the USSR's.  The second, a lot of theories and background which are useful in chess-playing technique, computer programming, management decision-making, human-reasoning, etc.  Chapter 3 has: the confussing math expressions with those beautiful Greek letters.  Chapter 4: using bit-map to represent attack-defense paths that the decisions and evaluations in chapter 3 will compute.  Chapter 5: using the his famous win over Capablanca as experiment to illustrate his math expression.  Chapter 6: a useless one; he spent 7 pages to list some of his own games as excercise.  (Why? If we want examples, Alekhine's, Capa's, Lasker's, Tal's or Fischer's are more typical.)  In addition, many diagrams are so large, while the whole book is only about 90 pages.  More than 10% of the pages goes wasted, killing at least 3 trees.  Chapter 7: the future of computer chess.  There are four chapters for the Appendices.<BR>In summary, it is good book at the time, too confussing (at least to a literacy-challenged reader like me), and some minuses mentioned above.  Four stars for your book, GM and many-time world chess champion Botvinnik!!!!   (****)	2003-11-19

The first book is Chernev's &quot;The most instructive chess games ever played.&quot;  This book explains the chess struggle as the battle of geometry.  It uses the terms: files, ranks, and diagonals to show how carry an attack from one part of the board to another place.  Then it explains how the pawn structures affect these routes.  Finally, it shows the color complex and minority attack.  The enclosed illustrated games are very clear.  Before the game, the author tells us what points we are looking for during the game.  The final game between Kasparov and Pribyl is very exciting; it shows how much a passed pawn is stronger than a piece.  And at the last step of its journey, Kasparov uses it to a great effect.  First he uses it as a blocker to cut communication between K-side and Q-side of black side; and at last, he throws it away to deflect black rook for a devastating attack.  After seeing that game, we could learn at least a little how to use the passed pawn, and how to play the Queen on a K-attack.<BR>Very good book indeed!	2003-11-11

I bought this book for two reasons: Brontein's name and sections 2 and 3.  Bronstein is famous for many unique characteristics: let the Champion, Botvinnik, escape with a draw; lost to Spassky by King Gambit in a Soviet Championship; a few year later beat Tal(!) in a KG (again) in a USSR team championship; meditating the first move as white for more than 30 min before making it!  He is the first is to use the KID, QID, and Gruenfeld extensively in his games.  Like Nimzowitsch, he never is afraid to test his innovation at the chessboard.  He plays the KID equally brilliantly in both color.  One thing that took a star from the book rating is he's NOT the author; the author uses him as a consultant and uses most games from Bronstein in the book.<BR>Now the second reason.  This is the first time, I saw a book, that explains the use of EVERY PIECE at EVERY LOCATION during the opening, section 2.  In reality, this is applicabale to most all openings.  Just the order is important in each, and timing is the most crucial one.  In section 3, the author 36 standard moves for black pieces, then 24 std moves for black pawns.  After that, white's turn with 36 std moves for pieces, and 24 moves for black.  How simple!  Not realy.  The correct sequence, and strategy must be experienced with; like playing for K-side, Q-side, or center thrust by experiment and personal style.<BR>Good book!  Wish Bronstein wrote some preface or introduction and some of his &quot;best kept secrets in the KID.&quot;<BR>Two more points for experimenting with the KID.  Fischer and Kasparov use them too!	2003-11-11
US	43954135	RKE7HASPY1620	0486206076	783320476	Chessboard Magic!	Books	5	5	8	N	N	They don't write book like this any more!	This is a wonderful book.  Actually, not all the positions in it are typical chess endings; some are middlegames, and some are very improbable (page 115.)  The tactics in it are quite useful (see my preface below.)  I have re-compiled, and re-organized the whole book for personal reference.  If all the legal issues are covered, a re-publication is quite possible.  Following is the first part of my preface:<BR>&quot;Chess is a form of war theory.  To win war the military operation must succeed.  The operation is the coordination of many different armed forces.   In chess, even the simplest checkmate (R+K vs K) requires the proper arrangement of the checking force and the restricting force on the opposite force.<BR> I read Chernev's chessboard magic about 15 years ago, and was amazed by many checkmate or game-saving patterns.  For example: the ladder theme of problem 131 and the criss-cross pattern of problem 15.  I felt that they were only compositions for entering contests; not having any pratical sense.  Yes, some of them are way outside the chess reality; however some are sensible enough.  <BR> We all know a well posted knight may decide a game.  But a knight alone can't do much; some other piece must join in the campaign to bring it to a conclusion.  Capablanca wrote, student must  learn the coordination between the queen and knight because it would be extremely helpful in tactical chess.  In my very recent game, after a wild opening the position looked rather bad for me.  If I decided to play defensively, I would lose a pawn for sure and the game eventually becuase I had only 5 minutes on the clock versus 15 minutes on my opponent's.  I saw that I could force trade my rook pair for his queen and pawn.  With the initiative was still at hand; if I could strategically post the knight, I would be able to force a draw by perpectually checking his K by my Q.  His rook pair and black square bishop could not help much; because I planned to play on the white sqaures only.  The diffence in the number of pawns did not contribute much to the outcome.  By trying to hard to win with the extra pawn, he let me checkmate him.  The draw was properly the better result.  So, the experience in the coordinate of pieces could win or draw games; especially when the clock is running down.  At this stage the tactics are the main weapons.<BR> Like Chernev's The Most Intructive Games of Chess Ever Played, this Chessboard Magic! is fantactic, very intertaining and has some pratical use.  The only complain, I have, is, like The Most Intructive, this book was not arranged in any particular theme.  It is very hard to recollect what the student learns.  Mr. Chernev and readers have very good reasons to like his arrangement.  I failed to understand the logic.  They are right when they think that if the readers like to see the theme; they can easily use chess endgame books.<BR>I would like to re-arrangement this a little bit differently.  First it is used as a tutorial note for me.  I could look up the theme when I need to; or when I know my opponents prefer some specific pieces I can watch out for those tactics and use some tactics when I have those pieces.  Second, if the book can be useful for some chess players to prepare for his/her match well, I feel that I have paid my due to the chess community.<BR>...&quot;	2003-11-11

Then I read the column Evans On Chess in Chess Life, issue Jan/Feb 2001, I agreed with them.  Many games in this books can hardly be the upsets.  GM lost to GM; Champion vs Challenger's games can't be graded as such.  Usually, a strong player losing to a much weaker player or the player with substantial advantage blowing the game (Reshevsky's own game, page 180) could be put in this catergory.  Anyway there are many good games in this book; and the lesson here is even the champions can make mistake too.<br />Reshevsky, Korchnoy and Larsen are in the book; but Nimzowitch, Euwe, Geller, and Bronstein (one of my mentor) are NOT!!!<br />Another interesting point GM Larry Evans showed was the game between Euwe-Alekhine on pages 78 and 91 are identical but with some slightly different notes.	2003-10-20

Originally I planned to give this book 5 stars, because it was the first one to teach me about the positional play: rook on seventh rank, knight outpost, bad/good bishop, bishop pair, etc...  Now if I can give it 4 1/2 stars... There are two reasons for this change of heart: one for technical, and one, personal.<br />1)Technical: when I saw those games were from Master and GMs, I thought it was all I need to learn and graded it at 2000+.  After seeing Nunn's book (Chess Move by Move), Nunn's is a better one (thanks to the time factors.)  I agreed that Chernev's book is about 1700.  Nunn's is 2100+.  Nunn's is a combinations of Chernev &quot;Most Instructive...&quot; and &quot;Logical chess...&quot;  Nunn's explained the battle as it fights back and forth.  Chernev's is simple-minded; mostly from the point-of-view of the victors.<br />2) Personal:  The most single line that cost me more than a dozen hard-fought games is the second paragraph (and some from the first parag.) of game 43 (Schlechter-Mason): &quot;The extra Pawn can be turned into a Queen, as the good player knows, and with a Queen ahead he can beat anybody in the world.&quot;  Well, many times I fought hard, even from a bad position, to gain the extra Pawn; then I sat idly on it, waiting for my opponents to give up while my clock running down; then in time trouble, I blundered a piece!  Well, it's over.  I hope Chernev had one game to illustrate the point &quot;Good position doesn't win game, good move does.&quot;<br />Anyhow, how good is Chernev's book?  I have 2 (TWO) copies: one I use too much that it becomes loose leaves, I have to put it in 3-ring binder for frequent review.  The other is for collector's item.  THIS BOOK IS A CLASSICS!!!!<br />PS: After reading back what Chernev wrote, I realized the keyword &quot;as the GOOD player knows...&quot;  That explained everything; I am NOT... ;)<br /><br />YOU ROCK, MASTER CHERNEV.

Since 1984 studied chess programs like: Sargon, GNU, and Phalanx; didn't know how to make hardware for chess playing machine.  Then Hsu's book gave very good lead, simplified it to 3 keys functions: move generator, position evaluation, and program comtrol, that's all.  Some reviewer wanted more details like how the evaluation works; some said it was too technical.  I think the book is excellent, maybe a little more in the author's specialty: chip design.  Anyway the book is for general readers, like a PG-13 movie; he keeps the technical parts enough both spectrum of audience (even though I like too read more about the technical part, I want the author to win more audience.)  After that match in 1997, I could not find more good computer chess books besides Newborn's Kasparov versus Deep Blue.  I guessed the researchers began to lose interests in it because Mission Accomplished.<BR>By the way, if you want to know more about how chess program works (for example: position evaluation); please study &quot;FREE&quot; GNUChess.  I learn very much from it.  It's worth the effort.	2003-05-05
