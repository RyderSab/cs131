I have said repeatedly that I was finished with DS, yet, like some other reviewers here, seem incapable of resisting.  I remember when a new DS novel was cause for celebration.  Now I look forward to seeing how much further she has slipped!<br /><br />This is by far the worst yet.  I also wonder if someone else is writing for her now.  I had a hard time reading this due to the poor grammar, total disregard for punctuation and repetition.  At least I didn't see any spelling errors.<br /><br />I am a writer myself, working on my first novel.  I read fiction as a break from my own writing as well as to continue to work on my writing skills.  I resent the fact that this author is able to get away with the kinds of errors that would cause my manuscript to be rejected by any publisher to whom I might submit it.<br /><br />One star is too good for this one.  Don't waste your time or money, or even your library rights!	2005-06-05

O'Nan does not embellish this story in any way, instead, chooses to relate the day-to-day struggle of a wife who spends most of her adult life waiting for the day her husband will once again be free.<br /><br />What impressed me the most about this book was the way that the author captured the mundanity of life in small-town American.  As the locale for this book, he chose the Southern Tier of New York, with the bulk of the story taking place in Owego.  He paints a picture of this rather dull, unexciting community that allows the reader to feel what it is like to live there.<br /><br />Patty, the \\"good wife,\\" travels around the state, visiting her husband when she can.  O'Nan describes the drive to Auburn and Clinton, NY with such detail, that the reader can \\"see\\" the summer camps and abandoned trailers.  As a resident of upstate New York, I have traveled to many of these areas, and as I read the book, was right there in the scene with Patty. I have also visited Auburn Correctional as part of an outreach program, and was impressed by his vivid depiction of not only the prison itself, but the essence of the community.<br /><br />O'Nan also offers a spot-on indictment of the New York State penal system.  Prisoners are moved around and their families play a constant guessing game as to where they will go next, and how their lives will once again be upended.  In one prison, there are overnight visits, in another there are none.  Patty and her husband Tommy learn how to make do with the hand that they have been dealt, and emerge from it all intact.<br /><br />I appreciate O'Nan's simplicity of style and ability to bring these characters to life.  All in all, it was a nourishing read, and I highly recommend this book.	2005-05-12

I too kept a diary and found myself completely captivated by this story of hope set in horror.  I knew little of the Holocaust at that time, but reading this book started me on a lifelong journey of discovery.  The more I learned, the more horrifying these events became to me.  Even now, decades later, I am still unable to grasp how this could have happened... and why.<br /><br />This book carries the story forward with the premise that Peter, the boy Anne loved, actually survived the war and settled in New Jersey to make a new life for himself.  Unable to escape the past, ultimately, he comes to terms with it.  But his journey is wrought with fear.  It is a fascinating tale, and although I already knew that this was totally fictionalized, I still held out a bit of hope that maybe, somehow he really had survived.<br /><br />I think one of the most salient points of this novel comes at the very end.  As those who experienced this ugly episode in history die off, memories will die with them.  Books such as this one are a way to honor those who died and to keep the events alive for generations who were not born when this occurred.  We owe it to those who perished to never forget.<br /><br />I applaud Ellen Feldman for her dedication to detail, and for bringing this story to the 21st century.  The book is well-written, fast-paced, and grips the reader to the very last page.  It is a keeper.	2005-04-11

Now, don't get me wrong, I like Clay's music and was impressed when I saw him perform live.  But a book?  Somehow, I just didn't think that a 25-year-old could have all that much to say at this point in his life. But when I stopped at the library the other day, there was the book on the shelf.  I picked it up, took it home, and read it in one sitting.<br /><br />I was wrong. Clay Aiken may be young but he has already learned some valuable lessons.  His voice is strong and clear in the narrative, and he is surprisingly frank about the traumas that he has already endured.  His pain is very close to the surface, and yet he approaches all of this with humor and clarity.<br /><br />I was drawn in immediately as he talked about being picked on as a child.  I too experienced the cruelty of other children and those scars run very deep.  And, like Clay, I learned that what other people think really doesn't matter, and eventually discovered my own \\"voice.\\"  That he has come to this conclusion so young is a blessing.  Many people, myself included, have spent years trying to get there.<br /><br />I was impressed by his dedication to teaching and his working with children with special needs.  His foundation is doing the very thing that he yearned to do as a student and I applaud him for that. Let's face it, Clay could have \\"taken the money and run\\" but he's chosen to do something positive with his fame.  I think that's what sets him apart from others.<br /><br />I feel as though I \\"know\\" this young man a little bit better after having read this book, and I am glad that I did.  I will look at him a little differently now.  Thanks Clay.	2005-02-28

Lights on Snow is a perfectly crafted story that isolates a particular period in a young girl's life and develops all the associated feelings that surround it.  Shreve is a master as creating vivid visual images and chillingly familiar emotional responses.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />I am surprised at the number of negative reviews on this site.  Perhaps those people prefer a more formulaic writer - someone who writes similar stories over and over.  Shreve certainly does not fall into that category.  I am constantly amazed by the flexibility of her imagination and the variety of stories that she has told.<br /><br />This book is beautifully written and extremely poignant.  The fact that there is no real closure might lead one to believe that Nicky may appear again, as an adult in a future Shreve novel.  That would certainly work for me!	2005-01-28

Susan Wiggs has developed into a fine writer and this one may well be her best to date.  Her character development is particularly good, and her depiction of a military family's life is right on point.  I like that she created real teenagers too, complete with all the angst that is typical of those years.  Anyone who has teenagers can certainly relate to the eye-rolling and high drama experienced by the two Bennett daughters.<br /><br />I was pleased to find a female character in her forties who was rediscovering herself.  Forty-something women need to be recognized in fiction and this is a good start.<br /><br />The introduction of the heretofore unknown son was a bit contrived, and may not have been altogether necessary.  The couple's problems were serious enough without adding him into the mix.  Otherwise, the book was satisfying and well-written.	2004-12-05

I have devoured previous Berg books and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one when it was released.  But then, I don't know, I just couldn't \\"get into\\" the storyline and the 200+ pages felt like 2000.  I thought maybe I was missing something, and kept going back to re-read passages.  Still, nothing.  I finally finished and shook my head.  What happened here?<br /><br />I am glad that I'm not the only one who didn't get this one!  I was thinking maybe I'd been reading too many Danielle Steel books and my mind had turned to mush or something. What happened to the writer whose beautifully crafted novels had me gripped from page one?  I agree with the reviewer who speculated that maybe she had a five book deal and just wrote this one to fulfill her contract.  It was just not up to her normal high standards.<br /><br />I like to be able to visualize characters in my mind as I read.  I had no picture of Laura whatsoever, in fact the only character I could \\"see\\" was her mother as a young woman.  And Caroline, please.  Talk about neurotic.<br /><br />I won't give up on Elizabeth Berg.  Hopefully, her next one will be better.	2004-12-05

I will not read another Danielle Steel book - or if I do, I won't review it.  \\"Second Chance\\" was the worst book I've read all year (and I read a lot of them).  Talk about contrived!  The plot was so flimsy and transparent that I was able to predict the ending before I was even a quarter of the way through.<br /><br />As has been the case in all of her recent books, the editing here was horrendous.  It was so poorly edited, in fact, that I was distracted by the lack of proper punctuation and fragmented sentences. Does anyone know how to say \\"comma?\\" And how many times did she have to describe the woman's closet?  Enough already, we know.  It is particularly hard to read when I am a copy-editor.  To some, this may seem picky, but a New York Times Best Seller should not have grammar errors.<br /><br />Ms. Steel's themes are tired and worn out.  It is almost as though she is writing to stereotypes. She must have repeated the description Fiona's houseboy eighteen times but I had no real good visual of Fiona herself, other than that she wears a lot of Manolo shoes.  Her characters are absolutely lifeless and lacking human qualitites. The storyline is just plain stupid!<br /><br />I will make a BOLD statement here and say that I could write a better novel than this one.  I'm a technical writer so what does that tell you!  Enough already.  Danielle Steel, get off the assembly line of novel production and start writing something worth reading again.  Until then, I am finished, done, finito!	2004-09-13

Naturally, I notice the writer's style and pay particular attention to detail.  Having said all that, one might wonder why in the world I would read Danielle Steel!  I have no logical explanation other than the fact that her books have become a habit with me that I can't seem to break.  Every time I read one of her books, I say that it is the last, but, when a new one is released, there I go again.<br />I will say that &quot;Ransom&quot; is not as bad as her last few.  At least the plot is different and presents a new twist to her normal themes.  There is actually some decent character developement in this one and it held my interest.  Hence, the three star rating.<br />What I did notice, though, is that the editing of this book is even worse than the last.  I am wondering if she might need a new editor - one who knows how to use punctuation correctly.  Are they teaching punctuation in college anymore?  Some of the sentences in this book have so many commas in them, I got dizzy reading them.  Steel also repeats the same words over and over again until the reader can almost anticipate their appearance.  I just don't understand how these books get published without going through the same editing process that most authors must endure.<br />As a writer, I know how painful it is to have my work dissected and rejected.  When I read a book by a respected author, I expect to learn something about the process.  But every time I read a book by this author, I get more frustrated with my own writing.  A reader should note have to edit a published novel.  Once again I ask the question - Danielle, do you need my help?  Please let me know.  I am ready and have &quot;Ransom&quot; marked up, ready for the presses!	2004-05-16

Is Danielle Steel so sacrosanct that her editors are not allowed to edit?<br />I agree with those who have written that this book was an improvement over the last few.  Sure, the main character is the same, weak, indecisive, codependent woman but at least this one has a little gumption and actually stands up for herself.  I am beginning to think that these characters have to be a reflection of Ms. Steel's own personality.  Why else would she continue to create these weak women?<br />Danielle Steel knows the pain of losing a child and offers some good suggestions for dealing with that pain.  But as many steps forward as Opehlie takes, she seems to take an equal number of steps back.  It is so frustrating.  At least she reacted correctly when faced with the &quot;ultimate betrayal.&quot;<br />With some heavy editing, this book might have been a three for me.  As it is, with all the run-on and incomplete sentences and constant repeating of phrases, I can only rate it a two.	2004-01-30

Now, while most people are loath to admit it, Americans are watching shows of this genre and the ratings prove it.  From \\"American Idol\\" to the Joes - Average and Schmo; we are lapping this stuff up!<br />The \\"Bachelorette\\" in this story is thirty-something wife, mother and freelance author, Sarah Holmes, who accepts an assignment to \\"infiltrate\\" a dating show called \\"The Stag.\\" Through the magic of a team of makeover artists, Sarah is transformed into a dewy hopeful and manages to bluff her way through to the top 24 contestants.<br />What makes this book compelling is that O'Connell uses the experience as a means for Sarah to take a hard look at her own insecurities.  Rather than turning into an expose on the genre, the real substance of the book is the author's exploration of a modern day marriage and how \\"self\\" fits into that picture.<br />As cheesy as these shows can be, this reader found herself rooting for the heroine as she progresses through each round of the competition.  We get to know the other young women and learn of their motivations as well.<br />\\"Bachelorette #1\\" is well-written, fast-paced and very readable.  As the voice of the author, Sarah has a nice combination of wit and sarcasm.  The conclusion is satisfying yet leaves the reader wanting more.<br />As a freelance writer who covers reality shows, I am more than a little bit familiar with this type of show. I looked for weak spots in the sequence of events and found none. And, while I question that someone in their 30s could actually pull this off, I had to set reason aside and accept that one crucial element.  That being done, I sat back and cruised through this book, enjoying every minute of the journey!	2004-01-18

Little did I know that this book would become a vacation in itself.  I couldn't put it down once I started and was sorry to come to the end.  That, for me, is the mark of a real good book.<br />I tend to get real involved in the storyline and with the characters when I read.  I enjoy a book that spans time and especially appreciate a story about older women.  Fielding addresses some issues that are all too familiar to today's woman - spousal abuse, obsession with aging, sexual identity and career vs. marriage.  But mostly she is looking at friendships and setting boundaries.  I envy these women their history together.<br />The only reason this book did not get top rating from me was because I felt that the murder and ensuing trial was just a little bit contrived.  I think the book could have been just as strong without this particular plotline and would have been a bit more credible.  I suppose this was a convenient way to address other issues but still.  It didn't really seem to fit with the flow of the rest of the novel.<br />I look forward to Ms. Fielding's next book.	2004-01-04

Her &quot;voice&quot; is clear and Jane is a well-developed character with whom the reader can relate.  However, the storyline bothered me almost from the start.  Why in the world would someone want to go through this?<br />The end is just too pat and there are many questions left unanswered.  What happened with Mona Shakespeare (the author from New York)?  If the author had concluded the book a little more satisfactorily, I would have given her another star.<br />Still, it was an enjoyable read and I guess that's what's important!	2003-12-28

Once I started, I could not put it down and I think in doing this, I was able to get into the flow of Boylan's writing.  The momentum seems to build, chapter by chapter and once the decision is made, it is clear that there is no going back.<br />I enjoyed the humor that the author interjects into the story. Sure, this is a touchy issue and certainly such a decision is, as the author points out, like an atomic bomb.  The fallout is far-reaching and continues for years after.  However, to me at least, the author seems to plunge forward, maintaining his/her sense of humor despite the personal pain.<br />I was particularly drawn in by the relationship between Jim/Jenny and Grace.  Boylan does not soft-pedal the impact of his/her decision on Grace.  Grace and Jenny are a new kind of couple, not husband and wife nor lesbian partnership - just two people who love each other in a new, yet not unique fashion.  I thought it particularly interesting that they remain legally married and yet if they chose to divorce, they could not legally chose to remarry.  I found myself hoping that they will be able to reconcile the change within the relationship and stay together.<br />My only criticsm was in the heavy use of correspondence within the text.  In some cases - the letter to NASA for example - this is a bit too cumbersome.  Otherwise, Boylan writes about an intensely personal experience with both humor and candor and really allows the reader to better understand the difficulties endured by people who find themselves to be in the same situation.<br />This book should be read by anyone who is faced with this problem as well as by those who will be affected by the decision. Of all the books that I have read on the subject, She's Not There is the first one that really helped me to understand the inner struggle.  I think this will help families and loved ones of others similarly afflicted to better understand and ultimately be more supportive throughout the process.hroughout the process.	2003-11-02

As I read it, I was tempted to pull out my red pencil and edit as I went along.  The repetition was more than I could bear and the writing was so elementary as to be insulting to the average reader.  I can't believe that a writer with the kind of experience that Danielle Steel has doesn't even use quotation marks correctly.  Unbelievable.<br />The sad thing is, this could have been a powerful story.  Ms. Steel lost her own son and certainly knows a mother's pain.  That is where the problem lies.  Her character Alice is strong and well developed.  But no one else is.  If she had spent more time on this book it might have been different.  But, as usual, she power-wrote yet another and it didn't click.	2003-10-12

I have read several of his books and frequently watch his show.  He inspires me and his words have definitely helped bring me closer to God.  I really didn't know what to expect but was impressed by his skill in this genre.  The book is well-written and he uses dialogue wisely and correctly.  There is a nice flow to his words and the characters are believable.<br />Bishop Jakes intertwines bible verses and references to his own books throughout the book.  I hear his words in the prayers and his stength in the wisdom of Miz Ida and Tonya.  It is a rather painless way to get the message out there to those who may not be receptive to the stronger version.<br />The story actually holds up well and kept me involved.  It is a little bit predictable but that's okay.  I liked it and read it in one sitting so he succeeded in that.<br />I have nothing but respecct and admiration for Bishop Jakes and if he writes another novel, I will read that one too.	2003-08-18

Having been through a similar experience myself, I recognized Griffin's pain and actions.  It doesn't matter whether you are male or female, this hurts and it hurts both genders equally.  There is nothing more demoralizing than finding out that your partner has fallen in love with someone else while at the same time you have been oblivious.  Hits you right in the gut, actually.<br />This is a very realistic portrayal of the pain of separation and it's affect on all those involved.  I remember well the sleepless nights and constant questioning and &quot;what ifs.&quot;  It is hard to believe that someone you have devoted years to could abandon your love.<br />I disagree with those who felt that Berg's male point of view is weak.  I think she did a fine job with this book and I certainly look forward to more of the same.  I think a sequel to this one might be in order.	2003-08-18

But Grisham couldn't have known this when he named his character.<br />Otherwise I enjoyed this book and read it in two days.  I learned a bit about tort law too.  Ironically,  I am part of a class action suit right now but the stakes are very low, probably with a settlement under $100.00 per person.  So it was interesting to me at this point in time.<br />I always look forward to the latest Grisham book and was not disappointed by this one.	2003-03-24

For some reason, I don't feel entitled to write a review here unless I have actually finished the book!  And so, I struggled through page after page of repetitive drivel wishing that I hadn't picked up this book in the first place.<br />This is the absolute worst Danielle Steel I have ever read - maybe even the worst book I have ever read period.  Her editor should be ashamed.  Steel repeats the same sentences over and over, beating the reader in the head with Faith's purity and Brad's ridiculous notion that he must stay with his miserable wife.  The author is so out of step with reality here, it is pathetic.<br />Unbelievable.  Alex, Faith's husband totally overreacts when she tells him she wants to go to law school.  One of these \\"no wife of mine will go to work\\" kinda guys!  But the thing is, turns out old Alex has been having an affair all along so why would have put up such a fuss over this?  He was going to leave her anyway.  Made no sense to me.  And the way Faith and her daughters interact is weird too.  The oldest is like 23 or something, living and working in London.  She calls to tell her mother that she would like to go skiing over Christmas rather than come home to New York to visit her family (the way they act, who could blame her).  Faith goes bonkers but ultimately gives her permission to go skiing.  Tell me, how many 23 year olds living away from home need permission to go skiing over a holiday?<br />The emails were incredibly dull and the platonic nature of Brad and Faith's relationship was stupid.  Oh how she fought against her feelings - even went to confession to confess having \\"feelings\\" for Brad.  Nice but rather unrealistic.  Personally, I would have to wonder about a man who would stay in such a hideous marriage simply for the sake of not getting divorced.<br />All in all - this was torture.  If there were a way to give it \\"0\\" stars, I would have.  I see she's got two more coming out this year,  Three books in a year!  No wonder they are so bad.  The thing is, I really liked her early stuff.  The Ring was pretty good.  What happened?ould have.  I see she's got two more coming out this year,  Three books in a year!

I hated Rachel and Linda's codependency.  I hated Jack's disappearing act.  I hated Grace's continuing to take her husband back after his affairs ended.  But the very things I hated are what made the book so true-to-life.<br />Let's face it, despit the fact that we are now living in the 21st century, many women lives still revolve around their men.  The opportunities available to women are limitless and yet, we are still functioning as if it were 1950 when it comes to our relationships.  Elaine Kagan understands this and her characters are maddening in their codependency.  When Jack leaves Linda for his monthly visits to LA, her life slows down almost to a halt.  She wanders aimlessly around the house, listening for the phone or his car in the driveway.  Yet when he returns, she says nothing about his disappearance and life goes on until his next &quot;trip&quot;.  At the other end of the journey is Rachel.  When Jack is scheduled for a visit her life stops as well.  Her every move centers on his arrival and everything else including her children, grandchildren and poor beleagured friend Grace becomes unimportant.  She thinks only of Jack and getting ready for him.<br />It is obvious, then, that when he disappears mid-trip, both women find their lives suspended.  Rachel takes to her bed.  Linda continues to wander around.  When they find out that he is dead, they are both shattered and their grief is equally overwhelming.<br />I liked that this book featured older women.  Personally, I am getting tired of reading books about 30-somethings and their problems.  The population is aging and it is about time writers begin to address the lives of those of us who are creeping up on the big FIVE OH.  Older women have a whole different set of life challenges and fiction needs to get with it.<br />The ending of this book was slightly dissatisfying to me.  I suppose Linda needed to believe that Jack was coming home to her but somehow I just don't quite buy it.  Otherwise, I felt that Kagan really got it right.  I have been in that place of pain when a relationship ends and her descriptions of those feelings reminded me just how far down the emotional slide I can get.<br />I look forward to reading more of Ms. Kagan's work.as coming home to her but somehow I just don't quite buy it.

US	42417034	R3K0KKW0BQ5FJE	0316341118	537841158	Forever: A Novel	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Couldn't put it down....	I have always loved a long novel.  I immerse myself in the story and always feel sad when the final pages appear. I miss the characters and the excitement of simply reading the book.  This book was no exception.  &quot;Forever&quot; combines all of the elements that I enjoy, history, romance, drama and pathos and well as introducing a new element, Irish lore.  I could not put it down.<br />Hamill moves us through the history of Manhattan in a way that is both informative and moving.  His descriptions are vivid and I was able to close my eyes and envision the scenes.  Cormac ages and yet physically he remains young.  The city ages and yet frequently renews itself.  Life goes on and on.  I was spellbound.<br />I don't feel that including the events of 9/11 are exploitive in any way.  That day is now history and, just like all the other tragic events of the story, is an important part of the life of the city.  That the characters experience 9/11 becomes a crucial and necessary part of the story - not just of Cormac but of New York itself.  The city will rebuild and go on, despite the losses just as it has since Cormac arrived.  I can't imagine it ending any other way.<br />The story ends with hope and love and life and that is why I awarded the book five stars.  It has been too long since I have read a novel that I felt deserved the highest rating.  This one surely does.  I finished the book feeling satisfied but still wanting more.  I think that is the mark of a truly great piece of fiction.	2003-02-16
US	42417034	R3TYDCEZ9RN2LW	0375502238	955709915	Blessings	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Quindlen Has Written Better	Regretfully, I have to agree with those reviewers who found this book boring.  I too just couldn't get &quot;into&quot; it.  I have read all of Ms. Quindlen's previous books and enjoyed them.<br />I think the problem is in the way she bounces back and forth between the past and the present, sometimes within a single sentence.  I think she was attempting to convey to the reader the way a person's mind really works - we may be listening to someone talk, but our mind is far away either in the past or the future.  But in print this method simply renders the reader more confused that the narrator is supposed to be.<br />Her descriptions were excellent.  She uses a lot of detail and the reader really can &quot;see&quot; Blessings and all the assorted characters.  I think this is what Quindlen is best at.  The storyline, however, was a bit weak and implausable.<br />Overall, I gave it a three because I felt that her writing is good enough to rescue the reader from the confusing time skips and rather uninspiring plot.	2003-01-29

He writes beautifully and I have been moved to tears by several of his previous novels.  However, I am beginning to tire of this pattern of tragic endings.  I realize the whole point of the story was to show empathy between the grieving daughter and her mother, but I yearned for a happy ending in this one.  In my head, I envisioned Adrienne telling her daughter that she was finally moving to Ecuador to be with Paul or something.  That for some reason she hadn't been able to go up until this point (maybe her father was still alive).  I just felt the ending was too predictable.<br />I will keep reading Sparks though...	2003-01-21
US	42417034	R2V3CBUUHIVV8D	0375413634	70225414	The Emperor of Ocean Park	Books	3	0	0	N	N	I wanted to like this book!	I wanted to like this book, I really did.  After reading the reader reviews here, I was even more determined.  After all, the Today show was impressed enough to offer this up as the first selection in their book club; John Grisham was confident enough to endorse this author - how could I go wrong?  As I read, I tried to ignore the other reviewers' almost unanimous appraisal that this thing was entirely too long.  I love long novels.  I get deep within the story and characters and hate to see the approach of the last page.<br />Well, I hate to admit it, but they were right.  This book needs another editing pass, big time.  Mr. Carter repeats himself!  I was amazed to find many of the same sentences, word for word scattered throughout the book.  I am no editor, but I could have certainly pared this down to a far more manageable level in short order.<br />The big mystery didn't seem anywhere near as earth shattering as promised by the 600-page build-up.  Or maybe, by the time Professor Garland revealed all the details, I was just so sick of him that I didn't feel any impact at all.  No wonder he didn't have any real friends to speak of.  He was a total wimp.  Kimmer (I hate that name) was equally distasteful.  And what, pray tell did \\"Dare you\\" mean?  Their son constantly says this but I never really did figure out what this meant.<br />Still, I read the whole thing, didn't even skim through sections as other reviewers wrote they did.  Mr. Carter writes well; it isn't his fault that he had a spineless editor - someone who should have insisted that tome be put on a serious diet.  It would have worked so much better.  The reader just gets tired reading it.  I don't think that was the intention!<br />I expect Mr. Carter will produce another novel and I will read that one too.  I think he has talent and hope that he is not discouraged by the negative reviews.  He just needs to learn a bit of \\"word economy\\".  That's all.	2002-08-05

She just keeps pumpin' out, doesn't she? Her earlier work seemed a lot better to me, like she put some thought into them.  Now it appears that she has a formula, perhaps a program in her computer.  She changes people and locations but everything else is the same.<br />The thing that always amazes me about Danielle Steele is that her books are such best sellers while they should have only been circulated amongst the \\"romance novel\\" set!  Every time I read one of her books I tell myself that this is the last one I am going to read.  But I continue to punish myself. Of course they are such fast reads that I really don't invest any time in them, but still...<br />This one is particularly grim.  The characters are so one-dimensional that I got thirsty!  They are so uninteresting as a group that they deserve each other.  Are there really people like these out there in the world?  I doubt it but, if there are, I certainly don't want to meet them.  One minute the guy whose wife died is so grief stricken you think he just might kill himself, the next he's frolicking around with a woman young enough to be his daughter and is in love with her.  One minute all the woman's friends snub the actress, the next they embrace her with open arms (of course she had to wow them with her movie star friends and save a life first).  One minute a character is so devastated by her husband's infidelity that she is going to divorce him, the next she's forgiven him (after having considered the words of advise from the actress).  All this in four weeks.  Amazing.<br />People will continue to buy and read Ms. Steele's books as long as she writes them.  Maybe having a hard cover book makes the reader feel more intelligent than carrying around a paperback.  But why bother?  Might as well just give in and read the \\"romance\\" books.  Same thing.  But, as I said, I still read them, so what does that say about me?	2002-08-05
US	42417034	R2NDWE0FNROWX	0312278586	244886090	The Nanny Diaries: A Novel	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Great Summer Read	I love a book that I can pick up on a sunny summer afternoon and read in one sitting!  The &quot;Nanny Diaries&quot; is that kind of book.  The fact that former nannies wrote the book gave it great credibility.  The sad truth is, women like Mrs. X really do exist (I have met them).  Self indulgent and spoiled, I think they have childern because they are &quot;supposed to&quot; and know that they can afford to have help raising them.<br />Nan in this story is great.  I understand why she stuck with it long after she should have quit this nightmare of a job.  Grayer was the one who would suffer her leaving and one has to wonder how he would have reacted when he found out she was gone.  No wonder these people have trouble forming relationships in life!<br />I too felt that the ending was a bit abrupt and found myself wanting to know if Nanny managed to find an apartment before she was tossed out by Mr. Hairy Pilot!  I was hoping HH would offer her a room in his.  There did seem to be a few too many loose ends here.  Perhaps a sequel is in the works.  I think that would be great.<br />These two have written a nice, light, very readable book.  I look forward to more from them in the future.	2002-07-15

Reading them became a daily habit almost a meditation for me. I would read the stories and then keep these people in my heart all day long.  Sometimes I will hear a name of someone and remember having read about them.<br />This book is overwhelming to me.  SO many lives interupted.  The scope of the loss of life that day is dramatically illustrated just by the shear size of this book.  But I get the same feeling reading the portraits again as I did when they were originally published.  We lost some really extraordinary people that day.	2002-06-17
