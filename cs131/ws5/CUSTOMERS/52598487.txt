US	52598487	ROUSSL4LPS7IL	0825424003	472784180	Unveiling Islam: An Insider's Look at Muslim Life and Beliefs	Books	4	197	263	N	N	Beautifully Written - and Acccurate !	What a refreshingly accurate book!<br />Too many books about Islam are so focused on a let's-not-hate-them-or-that-would-make-us-bigots attitude that they usually make blind omissions of the most important aspects of the Koran, including its explicit rules on how to treat non-Moslems.  (Take a look at \\"Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide\\" by Bat Yeor, for an eye-opening look at the way Islamic states treat their non-Islamic subjects.)<br />One of the most startling revelations I have come across in this process of discovery is the de-bunking of the myth that \\"Islam\\" means \\"Peace.\\"  It doesn't.  Arabic has a perfectly good word for peace: Salaam.  If they wanted to name their religion \\"peace\\" they would have used that word.  Instead, they used \\"Islam\\" - which means \\"submission.\\"  According to the Koran, Moslems must submit themselves to Allah; everyone else must submit themselves to the Moslems.<br />I have posed this issue to several Moslem acquaintances over the years, and I usually get a response along the lines of \\"in submission, one finds peace.\\"  Well, in my kitchen, one can find a table.  Does that make \\"kitchen\\" and \\"table\\" the same word?<br />The western world is starving for the truth; this book offers a feast of knowledge in a way that only a former Moslem could offer.  I highly recommend it.	2002-07-09

To call attention to herself.  To throw together a diatribe so outlandish that it will become an instant best seller (it has!) as soon as it comes to the public's attention.<br />How do you achieve this?  It's disarmingly simple.<br />You insult enough people in the media until they invite you onto their shows just so that they can argue with you.  Like she just did with Katie Couric,  whom she referred  to as \\"the affable Eva Braun of morning television\\" (formulated deliberately to start a fight),  resulting in the sudden skyrocketing of sales of this worthless book.<br />And she walks away with the money, smug in the knowledge that we're all just sheep, completely under her control.  The sales figures prove that she's right about this fact, even though she's so wrong about everything else.	2002-06-28

My copy is well highlighted, and I refer to it often.<br />But funny enough, with all of my other reference books, I keep turning back to this one to do a quick look-up when I want to make sure I'm approaching a project the right way, and it offers up my answers instantly, and in some cases has saved me from barking up the wrong tree and recommending a too-expensive solution for my clients.<br />Another thing I love about this book is its amazing structure: every single chapter begins with a clear \\"Here's what's in this chapter\\" clarification, and ends with a clear summary of the concepts covered, in a very usable form.  And something I've never seen anywhere else, it has margin comments next to every paragraph that state what's in the paragraph they accompany, such as \\"Variations in Fa√ßade: reduce the number of objects a client must work with\\" or \\"Indicating the number of things another object has\\" - what a timesaver!<br />It's a good thing the pages are printed on such high quality paper, because I thumb through it so much - and put it to so much use!	2002-06-21

It tears down the myths behind the &quot;quick&quot; approaches, gives frank accounting of the real cost of gruesome surgical methods and their horrible aftermath.  And points you in the right direction.<br />It's an easy read, but you'll want to read it more than once.	2002-06-17

I have rarely encountered a book that makes it so easy to get right to the subject you're trying to look up, get the facts/explanations you need... and get back to work. My pages are all dog-eared and highlighted. If you're a harried developer, I think you'll know the value of that.<br />The premise of the book is simple: combine the good parts of other books into one.  So Chapter 1, \\"The Microsoft Toolset\\" is lifted straight out of the \\"E-Commerce Developer's Guide\\" by Noel Jerke, Chapter 2 is \\"adapted\\" from \\"Visual Basic Developer's Guide to ASP and IIS\\" by A. Russell Jones, and so on.<br />The surprising effect of all of this is that it's like having a research assistant who slogged through a mountain of material (useful and otherwise) for you and then handed you the highlights with post-it notes so you can save time.  If one of those sources interests you, you can always read the book it came from.  Or cast it aside and move on to the next piece.<br />And as books go, it has a high percentage of lookup tables and code samples.  Why? Because that's part of the \\"good stuff\\" worth \\"adapting\\" from the other books.  This won't win any book awards, but it does get yanked off the shelf more often than most others.	2002-06-12

W O W !!!<br />. . .<br />Long before it became fashionable to love NYC, I have loved this town with every bone in my body. Luc Sante stands alone in his unique perspective on NYC's true origins, including the stuff that some people would rather gloss over in the re-telling of history.<br />But I find those very things to be part of what I love so much about it. Where else can you learn about historical nuggets like:<br />- McGurks's Suicide Saloon<br />- the waterfront sailor-kidnapping industry<br />- the entire city-wide network of child criminals with their own social structure and entertainment establishments<br />- the life of a cop on the beat who must choose between corruption and dire poverty<br />- the Irish immigrants in their mud huts<br />- the months-long, open-combat gang wars that would completely shut down entire portions of the city, burying their war-dead in the sewer system<br />- the hilarious antics of live theater (where patrons in the cheap seats upstairs would openly gnaw on meat, and then fling the bones down to bounce off the hats of the higher-paying patrons below)<br />- the draft riots<br />- the waist-high piles of cloaca that lined nearly every street the way parked cars do now<br />and all in the same book!<br />I read this book on the day it was published, and have re-read it repeatedly ever since, flipping back and forth to favorite parts. And it's the one book in my house that I refuse to lend! (especially since everybody who notices it asks to borrow it).<br />Lots of people \\"know\\" New York City, but they don't know it intimately.  I feel privileged to have gained that distinction from reading this book.  What a blast!	2002-05-27

The food industry is desperate to prevent the kind of backlash that's been visitng McDonald's in the wake of  the (easily verifiable) truths revealed by &quot;Fast Food Nation.&quot;  But they shouldn't.<br />This book is not one of those &quot;let me show you how yucky the kitchens are&quot; books whose only purpose is to shock you and not really do any good in the end.  What this book does is show you the &quot;man behind the curtain&quot; you're not supposed to see (remember the Wizard of Oz?) in terms we can all understand, and reveals the wide discrepancy between the way the food industry works and the way we all (want to) think it does.<br />Is this a struggle in vain?  It might seem so at first.  And yet, as mighty as the McDonalds &quot;Goliath&quot; seemed to be before FFN came out, they have quickly responded to the public's outcry, and they're doing wonderful things now that they realize that good citizenship can still be good for business.  Let's hope that the rest of the food industry can learn the same lesson as they did.<br />Read this book, and the food industry will start paying LOTS of attention to the lesson.<br />You'll be glad you read this book.	2002-04-22

It's the man on the street in Riyadh and Jakarta who scares me more than Saddam does.<br />Sure, Moslems are people, just like anyone else.
