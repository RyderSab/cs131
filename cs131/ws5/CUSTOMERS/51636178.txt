Any time you need potatoes for dinner or an apple for a snack, just open the door and walk inside. Anything you need is right there on the shelves.<br /><br />But a root cellar is more than a convenience. In addition to providing the security of having a year's supply of fruits and vegetables on hand, a root cellar offers sanctuary. In an emergency, it could shelter your family for a few hours, a few days, or even a few weeks, if necessary.<br /><br />A well-built root cellar can be a good investment. It will save you money for years to come, yet if you build the cellar yourself, the cost of materials is less than you would spend in one winter buying food at supermarket prices.	2005-06-18

DePonte opted to shoot in black and white to starkly depict the fragility of these lands, toning the prints cappuccino to further suggest these worlds are disappearing into memory.  Her pictures are accompanied by haunting poetic narratives by Berry, who joined DePonte on the trip.<br />There are images of great beauty - a tiny lemur, head in sharp focus, body blurred, depicting nature's fierce will to survive. A young woman floating in water through a track of sunlight, the reflection of a cottony cloud wafting towards her.  But there are also photos that echo the ecological alarms of the text, such as a rancher marching skinny-haunched cattle across a burned-out Amazon landscape.  Then there's DePonte's stylistic innovation - nudes who \\"are posed to blend into environment to show how small and vulnerable we are compared to Mother Nature, who will lash back at us.\\"  Women crouch in submission or emerge from the rocks.  A male nude grasps a huge tree like a newborn clinging to its mother, to the words \\"Embrace this miracle, grow strong within earth.\\"  Image and verse suggest we are one with nature and in losing nature we destroy ourselves.	2003-06-01

H. Lawrence to construct a historical overview of class and gender relations as reflected and refracted in the pages of the English novel. Though recent discussion and women's roles in literature and culture has centered on women's sexuality as the defining factor in the female character, Fasick focuses instead on ways that writers have depicted women as possessing nurturing qualities that distinguish them from men. Rigid adherence to this idealization of femininity constructs a standard difficult for women to achieve. Held to the ideal, Fasick asserts, women appear grossly culpable rather than simply human. Fasick begins with an analysis of Samuel Richardson's novels that examines three linked themes: sensibility, maternity, and anorexia. She continues with a discussion of Frances Burney's treatment of the expressive female body. She then analyzes novels by Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Charlotte Bronte in light of Victorian attitudes toward women and food and toward female invalidism. In conclusion, she returns to Richardson, pairing his novel Pamela with Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover for an examination of cross-class romance and the resulting implications for class and gender. Throughout, references to conduct books and periodical literature of the time provide contexts that illuminate the primary texts. Fasick's insights will interest students of the novel, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century fiction, women's studies and gender studies, and class relations in literature.	2002-05-18
