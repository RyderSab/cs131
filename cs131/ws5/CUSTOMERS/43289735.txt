I mean just look at the photo for his latest release \\" Surrounded by Idiots \\" Here he is all dressed up in his best suit, he's gone to the enormous trouble of losing 70 pounds, has quite possibly the silliest grin on his face ( perhaps its just gas ) yet no one is purchasing, much less reviewing, his new offering. A sad case of 'all dressed up and no place to go.' But whats a Conservative talk show host/neglected author to do? Well, for poor Mike the competition for that Conservative dollar is extremely difficult these days what with books being released what seems like every week from holier-then-thou Neocons. I mean, in the just the last two weeks we've seen \\" The Truth About Hillary \\" Ed Kleins remarkable hatchet-job released and Bernie Goldbergs \\" 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America \\" come slithering out of some dark forboding Conservative hole. Yes, its truly difficult getting noticed in an era where books such as these are descending upon us in such a rapid pace. Apparently even Conservatives/Republicans only have so much discrecinary spending on tabloid styled novellas such as this. I didn't think it possible but my poor bleeding Liberal heart feels a certain pang of sympathy for our forgotten, yearning author/radio host.      But Mike all is certainly not lost. Lets go over one or two key ingrediants found in releasing a popular Neocon work of non-fiction and what is required. First big guy, you have to get a flag on the cover of your book. This is very important as Conservatives love symbolism. You know, the flag, Statue of Liberty ( Sean used that one onhis latest offering and see how well he did! ) or even perhaps the vast American heartland. Some guy names Beck just used that so perhaps we ought to wait. Anyway, you get the idea. Big pictures of America the Beautiful get those manly Neocons all 'warm and fuzzy'. Um, but in a 'real American' he-man sort of way of course. Not any of that 'gay stuff' thank-you very much! The other thing is try to get photos of despised Americans ( ie. Democrats of course! ) on the cover. Get a picture of Bill or Hillary, any one will do, as Neocons really hate those dastardly Clintons so you can't go wrong! Oh and remember try to be as judgemental and vicious as you can be. Readers love it when you tear into one of those Democrats/Liberal media types and accuse them of everything thats wrong with this country since the Second World War. Whew! Boy Mike I certainly hoped all this has helped. I mean if you want your Conservative fan base to open up those thick wallets then you need to start honing your skills as a real muckracker!      Oh, as to the book. I really shouldn't bother if I was you. Clocking in at a rather slim 220 pages, and double-spaced to boot, Mike has precious little to add to the already screaming banshees that make up the Conservative mantra. If you've caught any portion of 'Fox & Friends' then you know where we're heading. Lets see if i can be succint about this...    1) Bill Clinton...Satan!    2) Hillary Clinton...see above remark     3) Michael Moore...Godless Communist    4) Al Franken...Neocons really hate this guy    5) Dixie Chicks...ungrateful musicians/females ( an ' oldie but goodie ' )      6) Liberals...hate Mom and probably apple pie as well    7) Liberal media...why do those darned New Yorkers hate decent, God-fearing Americans?    Well, dear reader. No doubt you get the idea. Its pretty much the same laundry list that we've seen dozens of times before from Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the \\" We Love America and They Don't \\" Conservative playbook. Ok Mike, so this is your first Amazon review for your new release. I understand you might be getting lost in the recent stampede of Conservative diatribes  so I'm doing my part to keep the dream alive! See...who loves you baby? P.S. Call Michael Savage's agent.	2005-07-09

Stands to reason, no?     Well, after having a little sit-down at my local booksellers with Bernies latest temper-tantrum ( I simply can't find it in myself to actually give money to any 'author' who releases one of these self-styled diatribes! ) I can only come to the conclusion that Goldie is as \\" mad as hell and he isn't going to take it anymore! \\" Yes, Mr. Goldberg has set his not so intellectual sights on many Americans who he feels is helping destroy our country and he's here to blow the whistle on this 'Lefties.' And what a motley group Bernard has captured. Their all here, conveniently put together for the far-Right winger in your family. Those Hollywood Commies i.e Barbara Streisand and Anna Nicole ( Yea, I'm still working on that one too! ), politicians ( Democrats of course! ) such as Ted Kennedy and Al Gore and even those darned liberal media types, Al Franken getting special notice. For that alone I will start listening to Air America every day! And of course academicians because everyone knows you can't trust those Ivy-League smart-alecks! Oh, and Mr. G., in a misguided attempt to show-off his knowledge of popular culture regales us with a couple of  mean-spirited essays concerning rapper Eminem and Ludicrous. Imagine folks, he doesn't care for rap music! Yes, Bernies definitely got it going on!    Yes, there all here folks so if you're sick and tired of these darned elitists tearing down our country, he even has a chapter entitled \\" America Hating Media \\" (Dan Rather is special enough to be worthy of his very own chapter. Way to go Dan! ), then Bernie has the goods on all of them, here for your enjoyment. Well, for a small fee of course. But wait...I'm confused. Where is Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and the rest of those fun-loving,mad-cap Neocons who spew hate and vitriolic language everyday on their very own  radio programs? Surely Mr. Goldberg is simply erroneous in getting the goods on far-Right intellects such as Govenor Ahhhnold of California and our favorite mini-skirted pit-bull Ann Coulter. Well, perhaps he simply ran out of room so he simply forgot Tom 'Cash and Carry'  DeLay. Perhaps in Mr. Goldbergs next witch-hunt he'll get around to these 'real Americans.' Well, we shouldn't hold our collective breaths I'm sure.     Now to give Mr. Goldberg some credit he does devote a singular chapter to uber-Neocon Michael Savage. Perhaps the far-Rights biggest nutjob unquestionably but I cannot tell for the life of me if he truly dislikes this rabid radio host ( and all he supposedly stands for! ) or is Goldberg just calculated enough to throw a Conservative into the mix so he can claim a certain amount of unbias (no pun) hatred toward one and all. If so then Bernard is a 'equal opportunity' crumudgeon. I guess that stands for something! But here's the real issue...Mr. Goldbergs slim chapters on each of these 'Americans'are generally short, brusque and lacking any real substanative thinking. Bernie simply scattershoots is way through his very own ' Most Wanted ' list without any empathy, understanding and an amazing lack of compassion. In other words while Mr. Goldberg seizes upon these folks with all the zeal of a Sunday morning televagelist he never brings much more to the table then a shallow, brief and extremely intellectualy lazy outlook on his victims.     Well, after reading this short but oh so vengeful nasty piece of work ( Ed Klein would be proud Bernie! ) I can only assume that Conservatives everywhere are running to their local bookstore, cash in hand, drooling at the thought of yet another Neocon ' We love America and they dont! ' novella. C'mon you Fox News loyalists, don't be coy, you know who you are!  Personally if Mr. Goldberg needs to find another person who truly hates this country he need do little more then look in his very own mirror.	2005-07-07

Apparently a woman whose very prescence brings some Americans to hysterics and loathing.    That being the case for the life of me I cannot imagine what would possess an author to resort to releasing an offering that amounts to little more then vitriolic language, innuendo and heresay. Mr. Klein, once a respected author/editor, must have spend the vast majority of his time while, researching this slim volume, knee-deep in the Clintons nearby trash receptacles, all in dire hopes of digging up whatever dirt he could on the former ' First Couple. ' Granted the rest of the time he spent talking to others who, while barely knowing the subject of this hatchet job, spoke not-so-eloquently of Ms. Clinton. Apparently no detail was too salicious for Mr. Klein to pass on so he merely throws everything into the hopper hoping that some of these juicy tidbits will be titillating/sensational enough to cause many misguided Americans out there to seperate themselves from their hard-earned dollar. Well, its all here...stories of Hillary's sexuality ( one can only wonder what Mr. Kleins sexual proclivities might be! ), her knowledge of Bill's affair with Monica Lewinsky ( thus giving our author an opportunity to climb his moral soapbox! ) and the piece de' resistance...the ugly rumour of Bill Clinton attacking Hillary thereby producing daughter Chelsea. Granted there's little here that is noteworthy but if you are one of the legions of Clinton-haters then no doubt you will soon be feasting on the all-you-can-eat character asassination! I will freely admit that after a life-time of putting up with lies, hurt-filled rumours and sordid dealings in the press that this is well beyond the bounds of just human decency. There are fewer things in life worse then deliberate cruelty but that is exactly what Ed Klein has wrought! Personally while many defenders of this piece of trash seem contnet that this is more then just your typical piece of Republican dirty tricks I find absolutely no comfort in that fact. Mr. Klein has simply sold his soul to the Neocon devil within and while he may reap some financial rewards he will ultimately pay with his self-respect and honor.     Well, my suspicions tell me that after this little hate-filled diatribe that our Mr. Klein should soon be working for the National Enquirer...or perhaps even Newsmax, that bastion of right-wing yellow journalism. God knows ( and I never thought I would say this... ) who else would be in need of a journalist who makes Geraldo Rivera look like Edward R. Murrow. In addition I must say isn't it smusing to read some of the previous reviews sent in by arm-chair psychologists who seem completely disturbed ( no pun! ) by Hillary's decision to stay with her husband. I had no idea there were so many prudish, upstanding Americans out there who seem completely baffled when others do not adhere to their own strict moral code. Let he who is without sin...	2005-06-21

While I had purchased Suze Ormans initial offering \\" Nine Steps To Financial Freedom \\" I tend to take her advice with a grain of salt and a sense of humour. Don't misunderstand me...Suze Orman has probably forgotten more about personal finance then I shall ever know but these days with books coming out every year, a weekly television program, radio show and other means of her getting her name out to regular guys/gals such as yours truly I'm slightly suspicious at this point.    Granted, Ms. Orman has a right to sell any product that carries her name as she so wishes but 'selling' financial advice as aggressively as she apparently does should make everyone here think, \\" what is the intent of this author/financial advisor? \\" There's far too much marketing going on here for me to believe that Suze is simply, out of the goodness of her heart, releasing these works so as to benefit her loyal following and little else. Ms. Orman has indeed become a cottage industry, to say nothing of a quasi-celebrity, in this genre and while many here will no doubt disagree with my concerns I  am getting rather dubious as to her real intentions. This review isn't necessarily being sent to slam her but shouldn't it concern anyone who is seeking important fiancial advice as to where the advice is coming from and does the advisor have our best interests at heart...not necessarily just to promote another of her products. Understand though that by promoting herself as shamelessly as she does it does indeed 'cheapen' her reputation in this field and might carry the odor of someone who is simply marketing another product. Much as one might sell a tube of toothpaste or an automobile! Sadly, the whole affair is beginning to come across as slightly opportunistic. Oddly enough Suze Orman is simply becoming the Martha Stewart of the personal finance world. And I'm just not sure if thats such a good thing or not. Nevertheless, she does offer some sound advice and if youare seeking financial info then you could do a lot worse. Granted, taken with that grain of salt.	2005-03-10
US	43289735	R2KR9SFNYBNB7Z	1400042127	100769891	French Women Don't Get Fat: The Secret of Eating for Pleasure	Books	4	8	18	N	N	Getting The Skinny On American Obesity	Here's my confession. Being a middle-aged male in the throes of a mid-life crisis ( though I've yet to purchase a hair piece or buy a red Corvette! ) I was curious as to Mireille Guiliano's \\" French Women Don't Get Fat \\" Plus after reading several venomous reviews from fellow Amazon enthusiasts I thought perhaps I could learn a thing or two about what makes the female mind obssess about weight, food and all its truly bizaare consequences. Of course downsizing the portions of your meals are important as well but instead of obssessing about 'putting on a few pounds' the French understand the importance of leaving the table before you are stuffed. Actually, having a few meals with real Parisians who consider a meal a true event that may require hours out of ones day and you may have a good idea as to how French women maintain a body shape that many Americans can only envy.     Now granted with my ever growing waistline ( I prefer to believe my pants are simply shrinking! ) I too am becoming concerned with my body fat and what I may do to decrease my ever increasing girth. Granted women have faced these obstacles for many generations and while many here seemed to have taken exception with Ms. Guiliano's release I found it remarkably helpful...if not necessarily revelatory. Food for thought if you please. Now all of this may conveniently be thought of as simply a ' French thing ' when we speak of eating habits, calorie intake and the like but I suspect theres is truly much more then that going on here. As Americans we are constantly being bombarded with ads for food, food and even more food. Add to the mix that we have ourselves believing that we are simply in far too much of a hurry, running hither and yon, to prepare proper nutritional meals ( my excuse is my state of being chronically single! ) for our family. Plus, with Americans firm, some might say over-zealous, belief that ' bigger is better ' we have simply supersized ourselves into obesity and all its dire consequences! I mean, does anyone here on God's green earth truly need any meal that includes a \\" Whopper \\" or a \\"Quarter Pounder!? \\" I don't know about your dear reader but simply by walking past McDonalds I'm prone to gain a pound or two! Sadly, its all come back to haunt a nation that misguidedly believes that our standard of living is simply the best and that other nations should follow our materialistic, inactive, 'keeping up with the Jones' life-style.     But as Ms. Guiliano wisely points out that life-style may be our very own downfall! In my trips to France I've noticed the women that I've encountered ( and fantasized about! ) have an almost nonchalant outlook concerning their appearance and how to maintain their weight. Not once in my travels did I ever meet a women who seemed even the least concerned about her dress size and seemed to almost take it for granted. Why? Simply due to, as the book states, their basic understanding ( an education that begins at a very young age ) that simple excercise such as walking is paramount, that drinking a glas of wine is extremely beneficial and mostly that slowing down your daily regiment is key to good overall mental health. Add to the mix the French habit of eating smaller portions in their meals and one may have an inkling of what keeps women in France ( at least Paris! ) disgustingly thin! Of course their habit of treating each meal as an event that may require two to three hours for each meal may hold its very own secrets as well. Wherever the mystery lies lets suffice to say that the French truly know how to enjoy a meal, are much more accepting of what constitutes a healthy diet and seem far less obssessed with the pitfalls that concern their American counterparts.     No, I will readily agree that \\" French Women Don't Get Fat \\" is not exactly relevatory. Many of the points the author makes are simply good ol' common sense but if thats true why as a great nation as we still so obssessed about our eating habits and if our dress size is reaching double digits? Enjoy \\" French Women.... \\" learn from it and accept it for what it is. And as the French are apt to say, \\" Joie De Vivre!! \\" As for me I'm pasting a picture of Catherine Deneuve on my refrigerator, digging out my old walking shoes and calling it a day.	2005-03-05
US	43289735	R999W7WBJ6GYX	0060784156	386956201	Because He Could	Books	2	16	55	N	N	Bruised Egos & Easy Money	I was recently at a bookseller in Wash. DC where Dick Morris was making an appearance, touting his newest release \\" Because He Could \\" Curious as to what he might say ( though it wouldn't take a degree to figure out which side Mr. Morris' opinions would fall ) I was surprised that the overall turnout for Mr. Morris included all of about 25 to 30 patrons. Some of who, no doubt, just happened to be in the store at the time he was scheduled to begin his, at this point in time, rather predictable diatribe against the Clintons. His appearance was short ( and if you're a Clinton-hater sweet as well! ) and filled with the usual brusque remarks concerning his former boss and, of course, Hillary also. Overall the entire episode felt rather sad with Dick Morris attempting ( and ultimately failing! ) to give the impression of an author who was 'fair and balanced' and had an important message to relay to Americans, one and all.  <br /> <br />Now, I convey this story ( sad but true! ) simply as a vehicle of explaining just how desperate Mr. Morris has truly become. Its pathetic enough that first he sets his not-so intellectual sights on Hillary Clinton in that all-you-can-eat character assasination \\" Rewriting History \\" but to keep the gravey train a-rolling he now adds insult to injury by throwing his latesst temper tantrum at Bill Clinton. Does this man have any shame? Apparently Mr. Morris has forsaken all attempts at serious journalism and has become a full-time journalistic bottom-feeder who seems content to live off the Clintons legacy. How typically sleazy for a born-again Neocon who, ina desperate attempt to save his buised ego, sells out everyone he's known in an obvious attempt to cash in. And boy has he ever!  <br /> <br />Granted Conservatives are generally riveted by anything that slanders the Clintons and, no doubt, consider Dick Morris to be a writer parellel with the likes of Theodore White or Robert Caro. Incredibly they continue to purchase Mr. Morris offeringsas though he were Moses descending Mt. Sinai with the Ten Commandments! Reading others reviews it seems as though many fun-loving Republicans still haven't had their fill of Clinton bashing. Of course the whole affair is predictably sleazy and vindictive but whats to be expected? Amusingly many reviewers stated that they found Mr. Morris' book objective and insightful. I can only imagine that these misguided readers must have been living in a cave somewhere where they had no access to Fox News or Right-wing talk radio! Good lord! A book that carries all the intellectual honesty of the simply unreadable local Washington Times or that journalistic beacon Newsmax. <br /> <br />All in all here's a litmus test for dear readers everywhere. The next time you feel compelled to hand over your hard-earned dollar for one of these Right-wing temper tantrums better you might give to your local charity. Mr. Morris won't mind. He, along with the proverbial angry Zell Miller, have already become the Neocons favorite turncoats.	2004-11-21
US	43289735	RW4I2B2MOH416	0399149325	994558302	Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper--Case Closed	Books	2	18	21	N	N	Histories Mysteries	Apparently congrats are in order! Yes, while British authorities and serial killer devotees have struggled for many years with the mystery of the true identity of Jack the Ripper one of America's favorite mystery writers takes time from her, no doubt, busy scheldule to solve this pesky little  'whodunnit.' Yes, while many of the worlds greatest minds have been baffled by who the true culprit was our author simply 'crosses the pond' takes a few notes, picks a worthy ( if not terribly convenient ) subject and voila!! Mystery solved. Splendid indeed...perhaps next Ms. Cornwell will help by solving that troublesome Middle East problem that keeps cropping up.<br />Excuse me? But surely the 'Jack the Ripper' case is truly solved. I mean, Patricia Cornwell and her publishing house have subtitled her work &quot; Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed &quot; All done up nice and tidy, no? Well, perhaps not. Actually for this author to be so presumptuous as to subtitle this novel with the smug &quot;Case Closed &quot; I find almost offensive in its arrogance and finality. As the Brits are fond of saying I believe Ms. Cornwell has indeed gotten hold of the &quot; wrong end of the stick. &quot; Not only is this misinformed book completely negligable of other factors involving the true identity of this madman but so heavy-handed and coarse that at several points during my read I almost had to sit back and wonder at the almost mind-numbing wrong-headedness of Ms. Cornwells beliefs. Yet, like the proverbial 'bull in the china shop' she prattles on ceaselessly, confident in her findings and, no doubt, sure that her loyal readers too will find her mystery-solving skills truly supreme. <br />Patricia Cornwell, who I assume, specializes in 'fictional' mysteries is most definitely out of her element here. Her lack of analytic thinking, lack of logic and her being far too focused on her one and only suspect belies a sense of being out of her depth. Her talents may lie in creating subjects that conveniently do as she writes them but sadly for our author true life is seldome that convenient. Yet, page after page, she attempts to pigeon-hole her characters into doing what she needs them to so they can fit her singular belief of who 'Jack the Ripper' truly was. One can assume that she almost viewed this offering as one of her fictional endeavors as well...happily coming to the conclusion that she had decided upon long before she ever sat down to put pen to paper. Presumptuous indeed!<br />And,sadly, to make matters far worse, playing the role of the 'tortured artist' she includes a chapter where she has a talk with her literary agent describing how fraught she is with this latest work. Even going so far as to state, &quot; I am suddenly in a position of judgement. &quot; Then adding true insult to injury our grieving author states that she has some misgivngs about being wrong as to her identity of the culpprit but after being asked by her agent concerning any misgivings she she boldly states that indeed &quot; No. Because I'm not wrong. &quot; Sadly, this smacks of a writer who simply has an almost religious zeal toward her own talents married with a pathological belief in her abilities to be the only human being worthy of solving this international mystery. At this point any reader should be in awe of this womans supreme arrogance and lack of sublty. And many Americans wonder why we're so dislike by the international community!<br />Well, in the end justice may previal. Ms. Cornwell's &quot; Portrait of a Killer.... &quot; was not exactly a rousing success for this author and today can be purchased as a 'remainder' for the paltry sum of $5.00. Fortunately Patricia will return to the genre that she does best, creating characters who dabble in fictional mysteries and quaint 'whodunnits.' As for real life atrocities I supect Ms. Cornwell should leave that to those much better equipped to deal with things here in the 'real world.'	2004-07-07

Where else can a once scandalized, and apparently easily bruised ego, Presidential aid turned author write a tell-all book about a former first lady, and still make a not so small fortune off of this temper tantrum. Yes here in America if for whatever reason ( and the more sensational the better! ) if you find yourself as fodder for late-night televison hosts then by simply running to  other end of the political spectrum, in an appaling attempt to save your very own extremely thin-skin, you too can be a best selling author. Just take a few potshots at any well-known Liberal and Conservatives simply will not be able to take their money out of their wallets fast enough! <br />That being the case Mr. Morris has written, at least what I consider to be, the atypical hatchet job on Hillary Clinton. No dummy is Dick Morris! Our author is more then aware that Neo-Cons in this country simply love to hate our former first-lady and anything that demonizes her is apparently far too juicy to pass up. Yes, those loonies on the far-Right, salivating at the notion of 'getting the goods' on Hillary have snapped up this little sleazy tell-all ( written in the best yellow journalistic prose of your local 'National Enquirer' ) and with fingers pointing directly at us Liberals are smirking to their hearts content. All the while content in the notion that they truly know what is best for America. Ah yes, that warm, fuzzy feeling of superiority that Conservatives achieve while reading diatribes such as this ( and of course by being spoon fed their  their daily dose of Rush Limbaugh! ) is simply far too delicious to pass up.<br />Yes Dick Morris, not unlike patriot Paul Revere, has come to warn America to the dangers of this one woman and how, if not immediately stopped, may destroy our great country and all she stands for. Thats right, its apprent by this authors writings, that Hillary has a scheme to take over America and simplyby purchasing this book ( and lining Dick Morris bank account! ) you can help prevent her dasterdly schemes. So lets any and all Neo-Cons reading this review please band together, purchase your very own copy of \\" Rewriting History \\" and help save America from....ummmm, well I guess Americans!	2004-07-05
US	43289735	RJ7VZN6MV38U6	0060763957	967480762	Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man	Books	3	9	29	N	N	Swing To The Right	Lets perhaps look at this from a different angle shall we. Here we have a release, not unlike Dick Morris latest effort demonizing Hillary Clinton in' \\"Rewriting History \\" from a Conservative author who apparently knows his audience extremely well. The very fact that filmaker/author Michael Moore has burrowed into the nerves of Republicans/Neo-Cons, as he apparently has, to the degree that entire books are being written about him simply states more then I ever could. Now simply by Conservatives screaming bloody murder whenever Mr.Moore releases anything via print or film tells me that indeed Conservatives are a sensitive lot indeed. Isn't it amusing how Neo-Cons wrap themselves in the Bill of Rights and the rock solid belief of freedom of speech but heaven forbid as Americans we should disagree or dispute their rather narrow view on all things political/social. Yes folks, just veer of that extremely rigid path that Neo-Cons hold near and dear and you too will soon be fair-game for the likes of such far-Right 'intellectuals' such as Bill O'Reilly, Laura Ingraham or even perhaps reaching the lofty heights of U:ber-Conservative Rush Limbaugh. <br />Well, with the recent release of 'Michael Moore Is A Stupid White Man \\" David T Hardy and Jason Clarke has proven once again that Conservatives have little, if any, true sense of humour. And sadly that may be one of the defining  differences between us Liberals and Neo-Cons such as Mr. Morris, Sean Hannity and others of the far-Right persuasion. While we enjoy books such as Al Frankens \\" Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them \\" mostly because authors such as Mr. Franken use humour, as well as solid facts, to help dispel the many lies/myths that Conservatives on a daily basis preach to the converted, staunch Neo-Cons, such as Ann Coulter ( the far-Rights mini-skirted pit bull! ) play fast and loose with the facts, come as across as extremely vindictive, sleazy and ultimately narrow minded in their almost pathological dislikefor Liberals such as Michael Moore or Eric Alterman. Sadly too though, their books therefore are filled with animosity, pettiness and no small amount of hatred for their subject. Apparently the life of a Conservative is never an easy one...what with keeping that flag constantly wrapped tight around their shoulders and all!<br />Ultimately while \\" Michael Moore Is.... \\" has its moments ( and I will agree that Mr. Moore certainly could use a degree of sublty in his work! ) sadly the book gives off the aroma of an author(s) who perhaps are guilty of the very same sins that they accuse their subject off. Overall, like Mr. Moore, the offering is the proverbial 'bull in the china shop'....heavy-handed, sloppy and by its end simply weighted down under its own narrow-mindedness. But not to worry....I understand that Bill O'Reilly is working on a brand new book himself. Mmmmm, can't wait!	2004-07-01

And though theres a divide the width of the Grand Canyon in each of their philosophical beliefs it cannot be denied that William Jefferson Clinton has reached a certain stratosphere of popularity that is generally reserved for film stars, rock musicians and the occassional television host, i.e. Oprah Winfry. So why should there be this constant outcry from Conservatives and others on the political right who consistently scream ( some may say 'whine' ) for this mans head? Well, as usual politics make for some very strange bed-fellows indeed and being the lightening rod that he always has been Bill Clintons autobiography \\" My Life \\" has actually fueled a debate over why this gentleman remains so incredibly popular...and most likely will forever remain so. Inquiring minds may want to know.<br />Uber Neo-Con Newt Gingrich tells the story of first meeting Cliton when he was Majority leader of the Senate and how after their initial sparring came away absolutley stunned at the then Presidents complete knowledge of detail, his command of dominating a room with his larger-then-life presence and how Clinton simply seemed more intelligent about every subject that was broached. Gringrich states that he walked out of the room awed with his opponenet and how he suspected that Clinton would make an extremely worthy political adversary. Well, while \\" My Life \\" certainly gives the rest of us insight into the childhood that formed this great man indeed it might be a case of far too much information as well. Just like the gentleman himself the book does tend to be slightly 'wordy' tending to give far too much detail about formative years that, while interesting, is simply much more then I cared to know. Nevertheless, overall the book does give a hint of what makes Bill Clinton such a dominating force in American politics today and whythere remains such a hue and cry from others regarding his larely controversial 8 years in office and how, to many of us, he was a subject of that infamous 'vast right-wing conspiracy.' <br />Indeed, what makes \\" My Life \\" so readable is simply that Clinton is indeed so utterly human. With a life that has been picked over as much as his, with a marriage that has been fodder for late-night television and right-wing radio wackos ala Rush Limbaugh ( by the way Rush, three divorces and you're out! ), many of us view Clinton has a man that we can truly identify with and commiserate with as well. His faults are ours as well and we understand is short-comings. And though many Americans view the Clintons with righteous indignation ( \\" Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\\" ) its truly ironic that they too may be held to the very same lofty standards that they punish the Clintons with. But...we won't go there! <br />Overall, this is a book that needs to be read. No William Jefferson Clinton is far from being a perfect man. And if you seek moral leadership from your Pres., or other politicians ( and God knows I cannot imagine why you would! ) then your opinion concerning this man may not change. Nevertheless, like him or not Bill Clinton remains the atypical 20th century politico. And that in itself is worthy of many more books.	2004-06-27

While, to one degree or another, Don &amp; Deidre Imus are doing a worthwhile venture in organizing and sustaining a ranch for kids with cancer, this couples recent release &quot; The Imus Ranch: Cooking for Kids and Cowboys &quot; does smack of not so little grandstanding by our authors. Why? Inquiring minds may want to know. <br />There's an old saying that goes &quot; no good deed goes unpunished &quot; and needless to say the Imus's seem to have taken this colloquial to heart. Turning to Mr. Imus's regular early morning MSNBC show one is barraged with the famous crumudgeons rants and raves about keeping up the ranch and how much trouble it seems to be for our favorite AARP talk-show host. One can only wonder why he would attempt such a huge venture if indeed it was the almost insumountable obstacle that he seems to constantly reminds his listeners that it really is. Nevertheless Mr. Imus, with no small religious  fervor, chronically regales us with all the trouble he understakes for these sick children and how, in his very own words, &quot; I simply don't need all this! &quot; All the while turning a rather unpleasant shade of red with eyes bulging, mumbling incoherently and looking for all intense purposes as if he may blow the proverbial gasket. Ah, apparently the life of a good-natured, though highly irrascible, talk show host is never an easy one! Or so one would think from listening to the &quot;Iman.&quot; Apparently our talk/radio show host has no qualms with letting the world know just what a truly outstanding samaritan he misguidedly believes he ctually believes he is. &quot;Don, me thinks you protest too much!&quot;<br />All this would be good and well but to release a cookbook that seems little more then another sad example of him and the Mrs. &quot; blowing their very own horn &quot; seems not only disingenuous but even a little unseemly as well. While hiding under the guise of 'do-gooders' the Imus's tend to ultimately come across as a couple who are seeking sainthood for their well-intended, if not intensely self-aggrandizing, purposes. The book, while offerng little in the way of respectable recipies, has our favorite cowboy couple in full Southwest overload with pictures of the ranch and of course with photos of their own son Wyatt as well. Sadly, nothing seems to be off limits for airwave's very own version of Roy and Dale Evans.  Again, a noble cause for kids with cancer but Don Imus just cannot seem to be able not to parade him and his wife's not so noble virtues for all the world to see. Sadly, the whole venture seems rather creepy and misguided in its heavy-handedness. Indeed, perhaps no good deed ever really does go unpunished.	2004-04-25

According to those mad-cap loonies on the far-Right ( and some truly bizarre e-mails yours truly has received concerning previous critiques here on Amazon ) I am officially a ' Christian-hating, ACLU loving, pro-Choice, Liberal media follower ( I subscribe to the N.Y.Times ), UN supporting, NRA opposing, anti-war peace nut, Socialist/Communist ( this person apparently believes the 'Cold War' rages on! ) and ultimately Godless 'elitist' who is subverting America and all she stands for. Not only that but many Neo-cons suspect that us Liberals secretly abhor Mom and apple pie! And to make matters worse I proudly possess the complete catalogue of Barbra Streisand cd's. Well, while being a Liberal/Democrat certainly has its pitfalls amongst the perennially peeved Conservative movement it does help to have books such as Al Frankens &quot; Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them &quot; around to add a much needed dose of humour/satire. Granted though, for Conservatives who subscribe to Ann Coulter's or Bill O'Reillys rather bizarre views on social criticism then you may have ( inadvertenly of course! ) located all the humour you may very well need. Enjoy Mr. Frankens offering...and in the words of our illustrious leader, &quot; Bring'em on! &quot; <br />All the very best,	2003-12-09

Books	2	19	33	N	N	Idiot Wind	So this must be what Republicans refer to as \\" Compassionate Conservatism. \\" Peering out from the cover of his latest offering \\" Who's Looking Out For You? \\" Mr. O'Reilly has adopted the appearance of everyone's kindly Uncle. Yes, that very same distant relative who seemingly insists on sharing his tiresome views and cliched opinions with anyone who is indeed unfortunate enough to have the extreme bad luck of sitting next to him during any given holiday dinner. That tiresome ( and talkative! ) curmudgeon that all family members tend to avoid but who, once or twice a year, is brought out of mothballs so he can be part of family gatherings and regale us with his own unique brand of social criticism. Well, perhaps this is a \\" kind and gentler \\" Gramps O'Reilly but I somehow sincerely doubt that. <br />When first browsing thru the pages of Mr. O'Reilly's latest book I had found myself thinking that perhaps this was a new and rather 'up close and personal' talk-show host whose new book amounted to little more then a quirky dose of self-help and cliche-ridden anectodes. That just maybe our author had gone through some grand metamorphosis and wished simply to share some age-old wisdom with the young 'uns! But apparently not for while this author, under the guise of being warm and cozy ( come sit on Grandpa O'Reilly's lap kiddies! ) he sadly resorts to the same arrogant and belligerant tone that those loonies on the Far-Right just cannot seem to get enough of. Well, there is something to be said of consistency...even if that consistency is, for the most part, sheer acrimony and language that is little more then vitriolic. Now granted, Bill does enjoy he very own rendition of 'tough love' ( thus being awarded the Far-Rights very own version of Dr. Phil ) with true kernals of wisdom but sadly they add up to little more then rehashed, time-honored cliches that one may hear on any given segment of \\" Oprah! \\" Yes, all the usual suspects make their appearance....self-reliace, thegov't., the liberal media and of course the old stand-by immigration ( Grandpa O'Reilly has some choice words for those darned illegals! ). Again, all written in such a simplistic manner that even those madcaps on the Far-Right should enjoy without the further assistance of pictures. Sadly, this offering from America's favorite hard-right gasbag amounts to little more then, I suspect, an opportunity to seperate those loyal listeners from their hard earned dollar. Never let it be said that Mr. O'Reilly wasn't adept at marketing his very own 'not-so-good' name.<BR> <br />Well, after digesting ' the wit and wisdom ' of Bill O'Reilly ( and with the help of spicing the egg nog! ) I think we can safely put our favorite cantankerous talk-show host to bed. The life of a long-winded talk show host/author is, sadly, not an easy one! No doubt soon enough he'll be spoon-feeding Conservatives even more bizarre tales of ' those darned Liberals ' and other frightingly dull and obvious witticisms that only Grandpa O'Reilly could conure up.	2003-11-24

Lets be perfectly frank about this incident shall we....this, sadly, was little more then a typical Rush Limbaugh/Far-Right radio bashing and personal attack on a child who was never in a position to defend herself. An incredibly juvenile act but one that we've come to expect from over-inflated gasbags such as Rush. Can anyone truly belive that Mr. Limbaugh and his cohorts made a 'harmless error' and then proceeded to feign innocence? How terribly convenient! Previous pro-Rush reviewers who expect us to buy into this 'innocent mistake' must also expect Americans to believe that this administrations policies in Iraq are all part of a grand scheme to bring Democracy to the Middle East. Please!! Now while this sad event should not be blown out of proportion it is unfortunately typical of far-Right 'talking heads' who seem to show an appalling lack of good judgement when whining ceaselessly as they do about Bill and Hillary Clinton.                         <br />Granted, many Conservative readers here ( and thanks for stopping by! ) will defend this far-Right bigot but how can any of us be surprised. God knows, we're talking about an individual who, two weeks ago, blamed the Clintons on his very own addiction to drugs. Yes, Rush Limbaugh, a man who apparently never met a Liberal he didn't hate, once again takes the 'high road' ( no pun! ) by absolving himself of any responsibility for his own pathetic behavior and blames Bill Clinton for his own weaknesses. Ya gotta love it! Mr. Limbaugh states that if it wasn't for the Clinton administrations lack of tackling the drug problem in this country head on our boy Rush would not be in the unenviable position he finds himself today. Apparently Mr. Limbaugh not only reveals himself to be a pathological liar ( something he shares in common with this White House ) but lacks any true back-bone and honesty. Again, raise your hands if you're really surprised by  these rather odorous turn of events. <br />Well, so  be it! No doubt Rush Limbaugh will soon return to the air-waves as a true martyr of the far-Right and he shall continue to bask in the extreme wealthy life-style that he has become accustomed to there in Palm Beach. God, who said this isn't a great country!?	2003-11-08
US	43289735	R9XMWJU20YM0S	0895261294	206337612	Legacy: Paying the Price for the Clinton Years	Books	2	20	69	N	N	The Great Pretender	Having recently caught Mr. Lowry on a Sunday morning CNN talk show, hosted by Howie Kurtz, our author stated that he felt that as President and Commander-In-Chief, William Clinton was a \\" montrously, earth-shaking failure. \\" Amusingly though, soon after one of Mr. Lowry's tirads concerning Bill Clinton Mr. Kurtz, obviously exasperated, asked him, \\" Did Pres. Clinton do anything right in your opinion!? \\" A telling moment indeed!  Now obviously <BR>its apparent that Rich Lowry will never be accused of understatement ( or any degree of sublety! ) I find his latest offering \\" Legacy: Paying The Price of the Clinton Years \\" to be almost laughable in his pretense to play the objective, fair-minded reporter/author who only wishes to release a in-depth and intellectual offering on the Clinton years.                   <br />Granted, many readers of this review will gladly shake their heads and condemn this critique as little more then the posturing of a life-time Liberal who is out ot defend our former Pres. but a book such as this does raise a valid question. Which, simply put is, with this authors obvious leanings/panderings toward the far-Right ( he does write for the ultra-Conservative National Review...not exactly a hotbed of fair and objective reporting mind you! ) does this Rich Lowry truly believe that he is capable of offering to the readers an honest, insightful account of the Clinton years...or his he simply throwing another log on the proverbial ' we hate Clinton ' bonfire that those on the far-Right have gladly participated in. Apparently Mr. Lowry is more then willing to roast the Clintons ( and gleefully so! ) but his pretending to do so under the guise of the (insert blaring trumpets here ) 'shirt-sleeves rolled up, hard working, balanced and virtue-minded reporter seeking truth and justice' is not only disingenous but little more then a bald-faced lie. Can anyone truly belive that Mr. Lowry began this book with even a modicum of moderation and respect for objectivity? Granted Conservative readers may not exactly be seeking anything short of the typical public-lynching that many of these far-Right authors are capable of ( i.e. Rush, Bill O'Reilly, Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter...you get the idea ) when discussing this former Pres. and, no doubt, this author is very well aware of that fact. But the idea of Mr. Lowry arguing his case on CNN, all the while casting himself as the next Robert Caro ( he of the excellent Lyndon Johnson biographical trilogy ) is almost absurd. If Rich Lowry was not so guilty of such pretense I would have much more respect for him and his work. Sadly though, while Rich Lowry makes, to a certain degree, a real case for many of Clintons inequaties and shortcomings, he seems so wrapped up in his tenacity to paint this former Pres. in the worst possible light that it detracts from his very message.  <br />Obviously this review won't be changing anyone's mind regarding \\" Legacy \\" and its dubious origins and that's fine as well. A release that retains all the so-called honesty and moderation of Bill O'Reilly's \\" No-Spin Zone. \\" should be read but as a whole taken with a large grain of salt...and a sense of humour. Alas, let me just state for the record though that I did find Mr. Lowry's release a \\" monstrous, earth-shaking failure. \\" With an offering that is so transparent and one-sided in this authors obvious hatred, some may say pathological, for his subject ( which again begs the question: then why even attempt such an undertaking? ) Mr. Lowry has done himself no small favors as an author of true merit and responsibility. Believe me, when you 'get into bed' with the Conservative loonies mentioned above you really may wish to do some serious soul searching! Perhaps in his next offering Rich will entertain us with his rather unique take on the U.N., higher education, the Middle East and even perhaps the liberal-tinged media. All done with his usual flair for impassioned objectivity of course.	2003-11-04

( and others of her far-right brethren ) are so perenially peeved. It must simply be due to the fact that our author has realized that her favorite entertainers are (gasp! ) Liberal. Ouch!! Yes, it must upset her to no end to find herself supporting these Hollywood artists/elitists such as Barbra Streisand, Susan Sarandon, Bruce Springsteen, etc. knowing full well they are the very antithesis of her rather bizarre o' world of politics and social criticism. But what's a poor girl to do? I mean, if Laura listened only to entertainers of the 'right persuasion' she would sadly suffer on a daily diet of music by Charlie Daniels and Toby Keith. Or, worse yet, only watch films by Charlton Heston or Mel Gibson. Well, perhaps thow in a couple of Ronald Reagans old movies ( \\" Bonzo Goes to College \\" anyone? ) but you get my drift. Perish the thought... so our Ms. Ingraham must resort to stamping her pretty little feet and shouting for her favorite singers to just \\" Shut Up and Sing. \\" Sadly, the life of a Conservative talk show host is not an easy one.                                  <br />Anyway, as far as \\" Shut Up and Sing ' goes I'm afraid its all rather predictable. Just the latest in the typical far-right ' all-you-can-eat character assasination ' that many of these so-called pieces of journalism end up being. ( just a thought...how many more of these must we suffer thru? ) In this latest offering Laura seems to have gotten her knickers in a twist over many subjects near and dear to this Liberals heart. Taking potshots at everything from higher education, Hollywood 'elitists' ( a term she resorts to on EVERY PAGE ), religion ( Godless Liberals that we are ), the music industry ( we may never see Laura at a Dixie Chicks concert ), and of course the old stand-by...Democrats. All written in such a manner that would have the reader believing that our author has 'formed these truths to beself evident.' But for the truly 'book challenged' Conservative she has generously provided photos of the entertainers who seem have the temerity to piss her off the most. No, our Ms. Ingraham doesn't miss a trick. The book ultimately is a rather odd cross between playing the proverbial finger-pointing 'blame game' and questioning anyone's patriotism that doesn't subscribe to this self-styled hate-fest.       <br />Ultimatly while Laura does have one or perhaps two points to make it sadly gets lost in the rather ham-fisted fashion that is passed off as journalism. In the end other then getting other Conservative readers all 'hot and heavy' with the many wildly accusations that she misguidedly thinks of as social criticism there isn't much here that is new or noteworthy. So the question remains...is there intelligent life in the world of the far-right radio talk show host? Sadly, we may never know.           <br />Fun facts: Who can guess how many times the word 'elitists' can be found in Laura's new book? Any ideas? Mmm, its kind of like how many jelly beans are in any given jar. Oh well, good luck!	2003-10-08

Any book that is released by Regnery Press ( the Fox News of the publishing world ) is suspect from the very outset. And obviously &quot; Losing Bin Laden &quot; is certainly no exception. Regnery specializes in releasing books that are always, and I do mean 'always', Conservative filled diatribes that are often vicious, mean-spirited and little more then extremely sad excuses to blame the worlds problems on former President Clinton and Liberals in general. All generally tacky and without much journalistic merit but there seems to be an audience so.... Anyway, with titles such as Mona Charens &quot; Useful Idiots &quot;, &quot; Dereliction of Duty &quot; by James Patterson &quot; and that truly insightful work of fiction &quot; Ain't No Rag &quot; by country musician turned author/social critic ( God save us! ) Charlie Daniels and you'll no doubt notice this is a far-right lovers dream library. Can't wait for Laura Ingrahams latest release from Regnery.           <br />As far as Richard Miniter's &quot; Losing Bin Laden &quot; is concerned one would think that the Clinton's not only conceived but are solely responsible for creating Osama Bin Laden. Not unlike Frankensteins monster Mr. Miniter would have the reader believing that Pres. Clinton was in a nearby labratory actually creating this monster and unleashing him upon an unsuspecting world. Ommiting former Pres. Reagans dubious hand in funding Bin Laden in the eighties. And of course ex-Pres. Bush's using this monster as well during his tenure as Commander-In-Chief. Oopps!, no doubt just a harmless indiscretion by our author. Nevertheless, how terribly convienenant for this author to play the 'blame game' and point his not so subtle finger at our former President all the while saying &quot; see, I told you so. &quot; I've seen this countless time in other Conservative books ( Rush, Hannity, Savage. The list goes on and on....and on! ) and actually done muchmore effectively. The book, sadly, is written rather clumsily and with comes across as almost child-like in his attempts to sound convincing. Yes, Mr. Miniter makes some accurate points in his release ( in his own ham-fisted fashion that is ) but, sadly, he seems so intent on 'getting' Pres. Clinton that he tends to take away a certain amount of validity from his argument simply due to no small amount of general dislike he obviously feels for the Clintons. Are any of us surprised?                                        <br />Lastly, I did catch Mr. Miniters appearance on C-Span the other morning and he did mention in his next release that he will focus on Pres. Bush's response to Bin Laden and how this administration has handled the search for Bin Laden and other terrorists. Something tells me this Republican Pres. will get much more of a objective and understanding outlook then Bill Clinton could ever hope for.	2003-09-12

Is it my imagination or do all of todays so-called Conservative authors ( and far-right radio talk show hosts ), i.e. Ann Coulter, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity and even Mona Charen seem perennially constipated? They always seem to have their knickers in a twist over something it seems. I mean with a Republican President... and a Congress that is ruled by the GOP you would think they would be in a constant state of political euphoria but alas those fun-loving far-right loonies ceaselessly drone  on about Liberals, the Clintons, the mainstream media and of course those Hollywood celebrities i.e. Barbra Sreisand and Sean Penn. I mean whats a God-fearing Conservative to do? Well, joining their ranks is, I predict, a new star on the far-right horizon.  ( Make way Mr. Limbaugh! ) And one who brings his own unique brand of ' Conservative crazy ' to the table.                                                    <br />Dick Morris ( yes the very same Mr. Morris who was once not only a top Clinton advisor but alas the very same who fell from grace in a rather, shall we say, graceless manner ) has seen the light and now has not only become a regular on the fair-minded Fox Network News ( official motto: \\"We slander, you decide \\" ) but is also a top Conservative beacon. His latest release \\" Off With Their Heads \\" ( no pun necessary, is there Mr. Morris? ) rewards the far-right reader with more vitrolic and hate-filled spew concerning the Conservatives 'usual suspects.' Such as the very ones mentioned above. Now granted Dick may not have anything new to add to the truck load of Conservative rubbish that has been fobbed off as serious, analytical thinking by other right-wing intellects but fellow Conservative reader please do not despair. For Mr. Morris does enlighten his reader with some true gems, i.e. placing this countries current problems with terrorists and 9/11 squarelly on the shoulders of his former employer Pres. Clinton ( he states that \\" Clinton just didn't get \\" the terrorist problem ). Mr. Morris has especially unkind things to say about France ( apparently convienently forgetting who helped forge this land into a nation ) and of course the old stand by Hollywood elitists. Apparently our author never owned a Barbra Streisand cd or watched a movie with Susan Sarandon. I suspect it must be the patriot in him. Yes, Mr. Morrs grants his readers ( in his own ham-fisted fashion ) his very own, though not very unique, perspective on these extremely tired cliches that has become the very embodiment of the Consevative mantra.                      <br />Overall, I was somewhat disappointed by \\" Off With Their Heads \\" In the pantheon of Conservative books ( and God knows we've had a glut of them recently ) I'm afraid Mr. Morris' offering adds little to the contemptuous feelings that Conservatives have for all Americans who veer from their rather narrow point of view. Although for many of those of the 'right-wing persuasion' it will keep stoked the \\"we hate all Liberals \\" fires ablazing until the imminent arrival of the next Conservative, partisan release. It seems as though those on the fringes on the far-right are happiest when their books deal only in innuendo, condescending finger-pointing and wildly escalating talk of how unpatriotic those darned Liberals/Democrats are. It does force one to wonder \\" What are Conservatives so afraid of? \\"	2003-07-30

Yes, they're all here in \\" Tales From the Left Coast \\"....beginning with Uber-Liberal Barbra Streisand ( Conservatives favorite whipping girl ), Susan Sarandon and hubby Tim Robbins ( two Hollywood malcontents who Conservatives wish would just shut-up and stick to films ) and of course those perennial Conservative favorites.... Bill and Hillary! Those wacky Democrats who Conservatives just love to hate. ( one would have thought be now that all these vitrolic feelings may have subsided but those loonies on the Right just can't get enough of our ex-President and Mrs. Clinton ) Yes, according to \\"Tales From the Left Coast \\" those Hollywood liberals ( and the liberal media too, of course ) are responsible for much thats wrong in this God-fearing country and they need to be taken to task for their own good. I mean, free speech is only good as long as we all agree with whatever those fun-loving Conservatives may have us believe. Right?           <br />Well, after having the veil lifted from my eyes I am going to proceed to bone up on my Conservative mantra by listening to Rush and Sean Hannity and of course the Rights favorite mini-skirted pit-bull Ann Coulter.

It seems as though our Ms. Coulter has finally succumbed and has become yet other victim of todays sadly disposable popular culture. In a world where it is simply the perogative to be larger, louder (brash?) and ultimately much more 'in your face'( thus pushing the ever popular intimidating factor ) it is simply a sad fact that to be noticed ( and thus be able to sell more of your product ) one needs to stretch not only the boundaries of good taste but offer to an ever increasingly hungry, perhaps at time rabid, consumer a product that offers them that ever needful notoriety that as consumers we seem to misguidedly have no small passion for. Films and the music industry have been guilty of this self-styled marketing scheme for many  years now and it seems as though it has been only very recent that the book industry has finally caught on that to sell a product in America one needs to have a certain amount of dangerous notoriety first and formost. And with \\" Treason \\" it seems as though our author is more then happy to feed that small part in many of us ( Conservatives and others of the far-right persuasion may wish to raise your hand! ) that simply adores having someone state these tawdry little vulgarities and mindless accusations that secretly many of us may harbor as well. Indeed \\" Treason \\" if its guilty of anything ( other then countless factual errors and mindless far-right bigotry ) may be that of 'selling the sizzle and not the steak.' But what's an author in todays marketing mad world to do? Is she simply giving the reading public what they may secretly desire...or indeed is Ann Coulter truly flipped her pretty blonde mane in an effort to justify her rather bizarre take on this countrys growing disillusionmnet with the far-right?                                                    <br />Make no mistake...Ann Coulter may be regarded as an extremist and a right-wing bigot ( yet oddly arrogant as well ) but no fool is she. Pandering largely to an audience who seems to foam at the mouth ( to say nothing of opening their pocketbooks with alarming speed ) whenever one of these self-styled hate-fests are released our Ms. Coulter knows exactly which buttons to push to achieve whatever desired response she deems appropriate and judging by many of the reviews here in Amazon-land she has once again hit Conservative ( and financial ) pay-dirt. Ka-Ching!! By virtue of being able to laud silly accusations ( making Joseph McCarthy seem a 'victim' to the Democrats demogoguery is priceless! ) and rewrite history ( Nixon losing the election due to his support of Sen. McCarthy is another whopper! ) so as to sound as though it comes directly from Conservative playbook is oddly entertaining enough but when our author apires to a certain amount of respectability by having copious footnotes ( which screams \\"See, I did my homework!\\" ) is really almost more then this Democrat can bear. Though we do need to understand that with the recent release and popularity of Michael Savages \\" Savage Nation \\" what choice did Ms. Coulter have but to simply lower the intellectual bar even lower so she could appeal to the knuckle draggers on the Right who subscribe to any acknowledgement that Liberals/Democrats are indeed the Devil incarnate. Sadly, not only is it all terribly predictable yet oddly fascinating ( as though one were driving past a mangled car wreck ) but ultimately ( to say nothing of obviously ) so laughable that our Ms. Coulter and her unique brand of Conservative witch-hunt may be beyond parody.                                   <br />Overall, Ann Coulter is simply doing little more then excercing her right of free speech and, at least for this Liberal ( Conservatives may now point your finger and shout \\"Aha! I knew it!\\" ), will always have a special place in this Democrats heart. I applaud this authors obvious histrionics and her talent for casting a bright shining light on the sometimes weird and oddly bizarreworld of the truly 'out there'Rush Limbaugh 'Dittohead'  Conservative. A world where all the complex issues in todays world are simply black and white, where Ronald Reagan is the one true messiah and lastly where our author is considered a real intellectual.  Thanks Ann.... a Liberal couldn't have a better friend.	2003-07-11

At last! For years I've been searching for an enlightened, political thinker who could show me the way out of the vast intellectual wasteland that ,sadly, America has become. Someone who was a gifted and brilliant socio-political dissector who could lead America back to its God-given right as the world's supreme power. Yes, along with the likes of Thomas Jefferson, John Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln we now have yet another icon to add to the list of great Americans who embody the virtues that this country stands for. One who has not only extremely keen observational skills but a man who, above all else, has given tirelessly for the greater good of this country with little regard for his own needs. And, not to keep you in suspense any longer, his name is ( drum roll please ).....Michael Savage! <br />Yes, after reading Michaels' \\" The Savage Nation \\" I have seen the light and I too have a new perspective on how our boarders and very culture are becoming weakened every day by the vast hoards that are invading this country simply due to the temerity of seeking a better life for themselves and their families. How dare they accept jobs that most Americans would never consider stooping to, that they pay taxes that only as Americans only we should have the right to fork over and, last but not least, the very thought of immigrants coming to this country and becoming honest, decent hardworking citizens when the rest of us had to be born here to be granted that luxury! Yes, Mr. Savage definitely is on to something here..let's close the boarders, batten down the hatches and essentially become isolationlists. Then, and only then, can we become free of the worlds pesky complicated problems. I mean, is this any way to run a country? <br />( \\" Umm, Doug. Wasn't the very origins of this country and its greatness built on the sweat of others who only wished to come here to begin a better life free from poltical and religious persecution and tyranny? \\" ) <br />Well, maybe but I can't be bothered with all that right now. After reading \\"The Savage Nation \\" my testosterone level is at an all time high and I feel like kicking a little third-world butt. You see Michael and I have to save America from itself and being God fearing Christians we know we have right on our side. And, any dear reader who also has been enlightened, I implore you to join Michaels army ( we also desperatly need a slogan!) and keep America free from anything that's not ummm....well, American! As for me I'm going to pick up my other bretherens books i e. Sean Hannity , Ann Coulter and the rights true messiah Rush Limbaugh and free my mind from all this pesky Liberal thinking that obviously I've been brainwashed into believing. Darn that Liberal media! Hey, we're not called 'Dittoheads' for nothing, thank-you! Who needs moderate thinking, empathy and true understanding. I've got Michael Savage. ( or just perhaps he has us! ) <br />Onward Christian soldiers!	2003-06-19
US	43289735	RFKN7PG2C52G9	0743222245	376327637	Living History	Books	4	6	19	N	N	Mrs. Clinton Goes To Washington	\\" Of all the animals, man is the only one that is cruel. He is the only one that inflicts pain for the pleasure of doing it. \\" So states author and perennial wise-acre Mark Twain. And judging from some of the incredibly harsh and mean spirited  reviews for Hillary Clinton's biography \\" Living History \\" I see that observation is as current today as the time that it was originally spoken. Nevertheless, hope being eternal I purchased my copy ( which I suspect is more then many previous reviewers did ) and, while not completely bowled over I am impressed.     <br />Beginning with who actually penned Hillary's book many so-called readers seems piqued at the notion that Ms. Clinton did not actually write the book herself but had a ghost-writer do the body of work and she merely proof-read and made the necessary changes. I can assure any reader of this review that if you truly believe that the vast majority of your favorite biographies ( be they political or other ) are actually written by the very subject of that biography then you are truly misinformed. It is simply SOP for many of these books to be authored by another free-lance writer and proof read for accuracies and cohesiveness. Simple fact.                       <br />As far as her book is concerned I am impressed with the contents found within. Ms. Clinton does touch upon uncomfortable subjects such as Whitewater, Monica Lewinsky and the Conservative led failed impeachment process. She delves into her beginnings and her early years in college where she met William Jefferson Clinton. All told in a fairly simple matter-of-fact style. It is an extremely personal account of her and her husbands days in the White House and how, as President and First Lady, you do lead life in a fish bowl. Granted I do wish she seemed slightly more genuine about some of the misdeeds that seemed to occure with alarming regularity but overall I do feel the book is an honest account of those turbulent times. It is obviously apparent that Mrs. Clinton is an extremely politically astute and complex woman ( which may explain why some seem so judgemental of her ) and while others seem to suspect her of using her book as a platform for greater things I honestly believe that by writing this account of her life before the U.S. Senate she is simply answering age-old questions that seem to continuously come up wherever she may appear. Personally with all the vast scruitiny that she has been under for the past ten years ( which she has handled, for the most part, with true grace and aplomb ) I think Hillary is due some of the respect that many critics seem to feel she is unworthy of.           <br />All that being the case, I did enjoy \\" Living History \\" and feel it's achieved its primary goal. That being giving the reader a slightly better and much more personal look at our former first lady and current Senator from N.Y. and how she may be judged in the future. Oscar Wilde once said, \\" One can live for years without living at all, and then all life comes crowding into one single hour. \\" This indeed is Hillary's hour.	2003-06-19

Though, all in a concerted effort to get as many differently faceted sides as possible concerning one of America's unarguably true lightening rods and a former first lady who seems to bring out an extremely passionate debate. Whether you care for Hillary or not ( long considered #1 on the Conservatives hit parade! ) she does bring out the best and worst instincts in America's voters. A fascinating subject indeed! <br />Now, with all that being said...Laura's book ( I promise to stay away from obvious hot button words such as 'screed' or 'diatribe' though they both may apply! ) is interestingly enough not about anything close to a political analysis or even a respectable biography but, oddly enough, it seems to written as a character study of our former first lady. It seems as though our author simply abhors Ms. Clinton though not just for her very politics ( though I'm certain she'll get around to that eventually ) but for how Ms. Ingraham feels Hillary has obtained her unique position in life and the temerity, Laura mistakingly feels, of actually having advanced to her position solely due to her marriage. Ms. Ingraham seems to lack a complete understanding of her subjects intellect ( or perhaps simply refuses to acknowledge Hillarys mental acumen. It's difficult to tell in this book ) Either way Laura makes the classic mistake of underestimating her opponent! Apparently no area is off hands for our Ms. Ingraham and I find this sad little book little more then an attempt at 'character assasination.' Laura ceaselessly warns the reader that Hillary epitomizes the very essence of evil and that young women should be extremely careful not to choose her as a role model. Right! And perhaps young women this country over should look upon Ms. Ingraham as an upstanding figure of virture and morals. <br />What Ms. Ingraham fails to recognize is simply by virtue of beating your subject verbally over the head as often as she seems to do ( and sadly seems to take great pleasure in ) she fails not only to bring a new and insightful understanding of Hillary but, in some cases, even evokes her as a martyr/victim when raked over the proverbial coals by this author. I was initially hoping for a book that delved into Hillary Clintons life and provided an intellectual source of understanding and empathy perhaps with just a little philosophizing. But, and again sadly, Laura simply 1) dislikes her subject so much that she simply cannot be bothered with any amount of empathy and true insight much less understanding or 2) I suspect our author does not possess the intellectual 'cajones' to do justice to this fascinating figure. Ms. Ingraham may be an extremely bright woman but she seems to be living in an intellectual vacuum when writing about Hillary Clinton. A clear cut case of Laura not being able to 'see the forest through the trees.'<br />Lastly, and this certainly puts Ms Ingraham's very own character in question, I find it ironic that Ms. Ingraham is able to greatly profit financially from a subject that she so obviously feels reprehensible about. If our author truly showed any real principle and integrity ( something she feels her subject lacks in spades ) about her loathing of Hillary Clinton how is it possible for her to accept money from a subject that she so readily admits having no respect for. Well, apparently it's fine for her to 'prostitute' her less then admirable writing talents and attempt to crucify Ms. Clinton... all the while raking in large amounts of cash. Obviously while she may severely dislike Hillary our author is far from being proud enough to use her as a source of income. Laura's nextbook may wish to concentrate on her very own psyche and character. A classic study in self-loathing.	2003-06-05

With the recent onslaught of books coming from the not-so radical Right ( where they never met a Liberal they didn't abhor! ) it is truly a pleasure to walk into my local bookseller and see Sidney Blumenthal's book \\" The Clinton Wars. \\" At last a work of non-fiction that didn't require that I take a long, hot shower after perusing it's pages and one where I gratefully was not subjected to some more of the typical Clinton bashing and finger-waging of our favorite seething Conservatives who apparently continue to work out some very serious issues regarding our former ( and still extremely popular! ) President. <br />Mr. Blumenthal enjoyed unlimited access to President Clinton during his second tenure and much of what happened during that, at times, scandalous and hectic period of our country's history. Blumenthal does touch upon the Lewinsky scandal, Whitewater, Kenneth Starr and the failed Republican led impeachment process. At times though there truly is simply far too much tedious information to be found within but that is a small gripe overall. Coming in at 800 pages the reader is diluged with a wealth of info that probably isn't necessary but I suspect anything less and the Clinton naysayers would be accusing Blumenthal of not being completely upfront regarding these turbulent years. It is apparent that Mr. Blumenthal does have an axe to grind with sleazy, journalistic bottom-feeder Matt Drudge, who falsely accused him of wife-beating, but I can hardly fault Sidney for wishing to set the story straight on that not-so-small issue and clear his good name. Make no mistake, Mr. Blumenthal was by all accounts an extremely difficult man to work with and obviously he wielded a powerful stick while attending to his duties for President and Mrs. Clinton but, I greatly suspect, being constantly barraged with duties that most of us would find far too over-whelming it is no small wonder as to why he, at times, comes across as slightly contemptible to many of those who he feels would do harm to the man who occupied the Oval Office. Friends and enemies alike ( and there are many on both sides! ) freely admit as to Sydney Blumenthal being more then capable regarding his duites in the White House. Quite a complement seeing how divisive are the occupants who run the White House as of this critique. Overall, the \\" Clinton Wars \\" reads like the excellent account of the Washington insider that it promises to be. Whether you're a fan of President Clinton or not ( and if not then you probably haven't read this far anyway! ) this is most definitley worth your time and effort.	2003-05-30

After years of watching Mona Charen on the Sunday morning talk shows I had, up to the release of her not-so subtle book \\"Useful Idiots \\", a modicum of respect for her as a thoughtful and concise journalist. She had always impressed me as a woman who was capable of understanding both sides of any given issue and thereby made intelligent and honest observations on complicated issues that face America today. Well, after sorting through her latest \\" attack \\" on all things Democrat/Left-Wing I now can only wonder at how appallingly wrong I was in awarding Mona that respect she obviously has yet to earn. <br />While fairly recently being subjected to a glut of books by so-called thinking Conservatives ( an oxy-moron? ) such as Michael Savage, Bill O'Reilly and the 'Queen of Mean' Ann Coulter I had come to the sad conclusion that many of these hate-filled, finger pointing diatribes were written not to necessarily inform what they felt was apparently an ill-advised American voter as to the evils of Liberalism but also, I deeply suspect, to make a name for oneself on the lecture circuit and perhaps even make a dollar or two. I mean, it is a free market society, is it not? Now, while I would never have put Ms. Charen in that grouping of 'intellectually challenged' die hard Conservatives<BR> ( vast right-wing conspiracy anyone? ) I sadly see Mona has jumped on the bandwagon in that ' go for the throat ' style of getting her not so subtle point across as to us Liberals. Including, it should be noted, having the temerity ( and an abundance of poor taste! ) of having the photographs of Peter Jennings, Hillary Clinton ( #1 on the Conservatives hit parade! ) Katie Couric and others, who apparently gotten on our author's bad side, on the cover of this so-called piece of journalistic lynching. A tasteless act indeed but done all in the name of selling a few more copies no doubt! And while, to be perfectly frank, she makes several fine points i.e. the Vietnam War, El Salvador and the Cold War ( which the Right still not surprisingly feels Reagan single handedly won on his very own! ) I will state that, as the saying goes \\" hindsight is 20/20 \\" and it certainly doesn't take a degree in foreign policy for this author to smugly point her finger, all the while saying, \\" See I told you so! \\" There's much of that to be found within the covers of her release and sadly Mona is so busy \\" attacking \\" the Left \\" she simply refuses ( or perhaps is unable ) to understand that writing devisive and narrow-minded books such as this doesn't necessarily better inform the American voter as much as simply catagorizes them into easy to understand allegiances....which I suspect is what Conservatives have desired all along. Personally, I've never subscribed to that ' are you with us or against us ' mentality when judging peoples political alliances but I suspect for some out there ( insert your favorite right-wing talking head here! ) it's a matter of convienence. I suspect I've had my fill of so-called right wing talk show hosts and commentators playing the ' blame game ' on anyone who has the nerve to disagree with their rather narrow view of what America stands for. <br />Well, I suspect in the long run that I probably should have waited before purchasing Mona's \\" Useful Iidiots. \\" Though to be honest she does mention in the beginning that she 'suspects ' that Commuinist dictator Lenin originated that phrase but she just isn't sure. So much for doing your homework! All in all I'm off to donate my copy to my local library....another bastian of Liberal thinking no doubt. And if you've failed to pick up your copy of her book, not to worry. I suspect it will soon be in remainders next to Sean Hannity's \\" Let Freedom Ring \\" which I noticed the other day at a bargain basement price. A shame indeed!	2003-05-24

An effect tool no doubt. Well, I find after picking through Tammy Bruce's self-contained Conservative screed, smugly titled \\" The Death of Right and Wrong \\" I, for once, find myself in agreement with Mr. Reagan. Is it my imagination or indeed has a cottage industry been born with Neo- Conservative authors cranking out these extremely sad excuses of hate-filled and finger pointing diatribes? Whether it be Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter ( the Rights favorite mini-skirted pitbull! ) or current flavor of the month Michael Savage they seem intent on saving America from itself. Of course the question that comes to mind simply is, \\" Who asked them? \\" <br />Ms. Bruce makes a point of trotting out, what at this point, has become the 'usual suspects' in attempting to defend her less-then-sterling thoughts on subjects such as feminism, moral values, our education system and of course the grandaddy of them all....the Left and how they are still the scourge of our nation. God knows tripe such as this has all been done so many times before so I can only assume that Ms. Bruce is simply pandering to a largely Conservative/Right-wing consumer who can't seem to get enough of this sort of heavy-handed, foaming-at-the mouth brand of politicizing. A brand of journalism that simply has little time for any genuine thoughtful, constructive analysis regarding todays complex issues. I simply must question ( as we all should ) as to what is the authors intent in releasing a book that largely ignores any semblance of honest, intuitive thinking and balanced reporting. Why does it seem as though writers of these self-stylized 'hate-fests' resort to pandering as though we as Americans are simply far too thick to understand todaysmoral questions and require these authors to show us the way. You would think Ms. Bruce was Moses himself descending Mt. Sinai with the Ten Commandments! I find that I generally don't enjoy books where the author is so obviously speaking down to his/her readers. And all the while, not unlike a television evangelist, becoming increasingly shrill. Though I must say that I was greatly entertained by Ms. Bruces idea of aged rocker Ozzy Osbourne as a \\" moral terrorist. \\" That in itself may give readers a small idea as to the desperate attempts this author will stoop to in trying to prove her not-so subtle point of view. It does make one wonder if Ms. Bruce checks her closets for Liberals before turning in each night. <br />Overall, I found \\" The Death of Right and Wrong \\" to be a thoroughly shallow and ultimately guilty of the proverbial \\" America, love it or leave it \\" mentality. Another unfortunate example of 'been there, done that' witch-hunt! Like so many Conservative writers before her Ms. Bruce wraps herself in the American flag and like the proverbial bully in the school yard dares any reader to disagree.	2003-04-23

While the author/editor may have their hearts in the right place ( and of that I'm not always certain either! ) they tend to be written, for the most part, from a slightly askew view-point. By that I simply mean seemingly to have been authored by someone who too is merely 'visiting' the city/region that I am reading about....and therefore long to aggressively explore and 'drink-in' the local culture. Again, a book being written from one is on the 'outside looking in' so to speak. And since I tend to wish to 'blend-in' when travelling ( I loathe actually looking like a tourist, don't you? ) I require a book from one who not only knows all the region's highlights but the cafe's, shops and little nooks and crannies that the 'locals' frequent as well. And when a travel book is written concerning the wonderful 'Lowcountry' of Georgia and South Carolina than I may be even more persnikity! But having lived in the South for a number of years ( I'm a transplanted Savannahnian! ) my critiques may be even more judgemental. Therein lies my dilemma!<br />The back cover of Cecily McMillan's &quot; The Charleston, Savannah &amp; Coastal Islands Book &quot; states that the author has lived in the 'Coastal Empire' since 1980 and it truly shows. The book itself is penned from one who not only truly knows the region well but from one who seemingly loves it as much as I do. Laid out for easy accessibility I had no problem using the book last summer when visiting Charleston and Kiawah Island. It even gave me much needed updated information on Savannah ( I've been gone far too long! ) such as smaller shops where I could spend my hard earned dollar, tucked away restaurants featuring delicious local cuisine and especially a vast amount of info on the surrounding islands ( Hilton Head I'm coming back to stay next time! Definitely! ) as well. The book also gave a sense of history for the region which I always find very helpful when attempting to 'get the feel' of any city/town and it's local population. Plus, there was an agreeable amount on local beach's that I didn't even know existed. Shame on me! Overall, a very well put together edition that guided me effortlessly through my travels.                      <br />Obviously this is a 'two-thumbs up' review of &quot; Charleston, Savannah &amp; Coastal Islands &quot; and why not? The Lowcountry is a marvelous region and one which possess's an abundance of beauty and a laid-back elegance which is undeniable. I found little wrong about this guide ( not much on local Golf courses but it did give badly needed info as to where I might find it! ) from the first-rate information that was easy to use and seemed fully up to date. And while I am no longer a 'local' ( for the moment! ) I am happy with my purchase and for Ms. McMillan in helping me enjoy my summer holiday. Perhaps you truly can go home again! Thank-You!!	2002-09-28

Well, my social life not being quite as adventurous as that I find it necessary ( and oddly fulfilling! ) to delve into the world of interior design and basic home management in an effort to put together a home that for me is not just a place to 'hang my hat' but also an enviroment where I can feel comfortable, secure and even, at times, feel strangely proud about the space that I've created. Obviously, by purchasing, and in using some of the theories found herein of \\" Feng Shui for Dummies \\" it's helped me tremendously in 'sorting out' my domestic priorities and in creating a home....not just a place where, as comedian George Carlin wittily observed ' we can put all of our stuff!' <br />Creating a home out of a vast, empty space can be challenging enough but for most single men, who may be considered 'domestically challenged', this is a task of herculean proportions that, sadly, many of us are simply not up to. Decor, lighting, colors ( swatches!? ) and other terms of design are some type of bizarre foreign language that have made more than one good man throw up his hands in exasperation ( and surrender! ) after just one afternoon of shopping for home-goods and the like. I mean, what is a 'valance' and why do I need one?  Well, what \\" Feng Shui for Dummies \\" has taught this aspiring home owner is a sense of self and how you can use that acute awareness to create surroundings that are unique to you as an individual.... yet also create an enviroment that 'works' in tandem with who you are, to promote self, prosperity and ultimately inner peace. And while I'm aware that some of this sounds slightly 'new age' it does, to some degree, actually work very well. I have been able to redesign every room in my flat to create a place that is fully functional, pleasant to the eye yet also ensure that each individual room works in accordance with the rest of my apartment. Obviously for any of the teaching's presented here they do require a certain degree of honesty and seriousness from the reader and myself being a life-long cynic I had initially questioned whether I could make that 'leap of faith' to give Feng Shui an honest try. But give it a solid chance and see what \\" Feng Shui for Dummies \\" can do for you, especially since few of us can actually afford an interior design specialist! <br />All being said and done, taking a certain amount of pride in your surroundings is simply, for me, one way of creating a sense of inner peace married with an honest feeling of accomplishment. My home makes up a large part of who I am ( and perhaps who I long to be! ) so I take much satisfaction in how it is presented. True that since we, as individuals, are constantly changing, therefore how I live will in some sense always be changing as well, but that's only half of the enjoyment of creating a small, unique place that will always be just that .... \\" MY HOME. \\" Thanks and good luck in creating your own small space in this world.	2002-05-19

Obviously that is there not so gentle way of informing me that I truly do need to, from time to time, make myself much better acquainted with that long neglected area. A room where I feel completely ill at ease and one in which feels as if I'm entering a dark, forboding dimension. And, unfortunately, one in which I am ill equipped at best. With that in mind I recently purchased a copy of \\" How To Be A Domestic Goddess: Baking and the Art of Comfort Cooking \\" in a sort of desperate plea to save myself from the clutches of fast food chains and frozen dinner entree's that is the closest thing that I, sadly admitting, have to 'home cooking'....other than being entertained at various friends homes and having them take pity on me by cooking an actually fully realized meal. For which I am extremely grateful! <br />With all that being said, Nigella Lawson's book has been, save for one or two minor 'accidents' that I've committed, an absolute 'Godsend' in helping me and my complete lack of baking talents. The recipes are done in painstaking detail and the photo's show the finished product in all it's glory. And while I will freely admit that the end result of my cooking doesn't always mirror the photograph's in her book at least it allows me something to strive toward.  <br />Nigella's prose is extremely chatty and very intimate in a comfortable, getting-to-know-you sort of way. Unlike some recent cook books I 've come across she has a wonderful way of putting the reader at ease when attempting something new i.e. breads, cakes, cookies and even jams ( which I may never muster up the courage to attempt! ). And while my none of my creations have come out looking quite as extroadinary as her's I suspect half the fun is in the trying! Ummm.....at least I do hope so! Obviously for the'culinary challenged' male, such as myself, a book such as this is not only an education but an entertaining way of getting more comfortable in an area where we once found ourselves 'visiting' if only for that morning cup of coffee!  Plus, of course, now instead of just entertaining friends with a wonderful cup of java I may have a wonderfully delicious surprise the next time someone comes over. And if that isn't comfort than I don't know what is. Thanks!	2002-04-27

On more than one occassion I've been accused of being ( gasp! ) Liberal so I now, throwing caution to the wind, wear the badge proudly....so to speak. It must be my Irish/Democrat upbringing! Nevertheless, although my sexual orientation may be considered 'straight' ( Gwynneth Paltrow please call me! ) I one day found myself in Lambda Rising, a gay bookstore here in Wash.D.C., browsing the racks ( and only the racks, thank-you! ). Being the odd man out has never truly bothered me.... plus where there are books, so there am I!<br />Without going into detail of the experiences of a 'straight' man finding himself in a gay bookstore ( a book in itself! ) I spied Michael Ford's novel and finding the title so engaging, and with my curiosity piqued, I started to read....and I read and read, all the while laughing, so hard that I thought they were going to physically throw me out of the store for vagrancy! Well, I succumbed and purchased a copy ( with little self-respect intact after embarrasing myself to no end! ) of \\"Alec Baldwin Doesn't Love Me....\\" and still after owning my copy for a little over a year I find myself still chuckling. <br />I won't pretend to truly understand anyone's else's lifestyle ( alternative? ) other than my own ( and who really understand's the opposite sex? ) but I must say that Mr. Ford's book of essay's not only left a smile on my face but perhaps gave me a little more of an understanding into the life of the average ( average? ) Gay individual. Can straight people say Queer...I'm really not sure what is PC here. Just curious! Anyway, upon hearing that even in humour some truth's abound I find Michael's book a compelling read, and not just for other's of the same sexual proclivity, but for other so called 'straight' guys as well, if nothing else than to help us all betterunderstand each other. Granted some of the book does seem rather like a cliche at times but that's a small point indeed. Michael makes some valid points about these little crisis that each of us face in our everday lives. Plus, I guess I was pleasantly surprised ( why I don't know ) to learn that after all is said and done that we all , to one degree or another, want basically the same thing.... love , security, a little happiness and secure in the knowledge that each of us, in some small way, is helping make the world perhaps just a little better than we found it. Fortunately, Michael finds humour in these everyday complexities and thank-goodness for that! Yes, I did laugh at Michael's book but I also found someone who was perhaps searching....and, like many of us, still is.<br />So whether you're gay, straight or 'somewhere in between' (I'm not sure what THAT means! ) pick up a copy, call up a friend, hopefully one of a diffrent sexual orientation, and laugh and learn at the same time. It's a start. I'm certainly glad I did! Now if I could only get Gwynneth's phone number!	2001-12-09

What a truly wonderful small book! <br />While it's true that I am a fan of Mr. Johnson's previous offerings I found this to be an indispensable guide due to it's size and &quot;off-the-cuff&quot; sense of humour that permeates the book. Obviously Hugh Johnson knows from which he speaks and is most comfortable in relaying information without seeming arrogant or smug. Something I haven't always been able to say regarding other &quot;so-called&quot; experts books on wine. <br />As to the book itself...very well done. Wonderful photographs, I especially enjoyed the section on corkscrews, and info that not only the layman could use but anyone who considers himself a fan of the Viticulture! Other chapters include the proper way of opening a bottle of wine, serving, tasting and judging.All pertinent information! Perhaps what I enjoyed most from this book is simply that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than a small serving of information that will help you enjoy that bottle of wine that you've just purchased and want to get the most of. No pretense here....just good,solid information at your fingertips. Bravo!<br />Overall, if you count yourself as one who doesn't wish to spend a lot of your hard earned dollars on a cumbersome, thick book on wines (Mr. Johnson has written those as well, and I have that also....and so should you!) than pick up a copy of &quot;Hugh Johnson's How To Enjoy Your Wine&quot; and while it may not have everything you may need to know it will get you through an evening out in your favorite restaurant. ENJOY!!	2001-11-11

The book is truly all encompassing and for those of you who are just starting out on the road to understanding wines and Viticulture you will no doubt find this book an indispensable guide! <br />As far as the book itself... it is layed out extremely well for quick and easy reference points and can be digested in small doses as the reader sees fit. There truly is a tremendous amount of knowledge encapsualted so you wish to take it oh so slowly.Plus, I found even the basic info i.e. serving temp.,wine-tasting,storage and even influence of soil to be helpful. Keeping your knowledge of the basics in this field current is still so important to all...not just the beginner. And, of course the photographs are very well done plus including the atlas was simply indispensable as well. Very well-done!! <br />And, just to nit-pick,I found the reproductions of older wine lables to be extremely interesting and helpful as well. I simply don't know where I could locate this much valuable information in any other single source. Altogether, a wonderful guide you'll find yourself turning to again...and again. Plus, it makes a wonderful gift! <br />So you may wish to pick up a copy,at a price, I feel,that is budget concious, seeing at how much useful information is contained between the covers.A guide for all those who truly love wines and the mysteries that surround them! Enjoy!!	2001-11-08

Being a fan of Peter Mayle's Provence series I was slightly apprehensive about his diving into the work of fiction but at the same time looking forward to his offerings. And, since after reading &quot;Hotel Pastis&quot; I was certain that he was still the author that I had come to enjoy so very much. With the addition of &quot;Anything Considered&quot; his literary skills, at least for me, remain intact! Thank goodness!                                  <br />This book simply catches all of the magic of his previous offerings. A mystery, love story and comedy I can think of fewer books that I enjoyed so much that I picked up a copy in hardbound to keep and read again...and again. Set, once again, in the French country-side plus  Monaco our protagonist Bennett, an English expatriate,lives out his meager existence until placing an ad in the Intl. Herald Tribune where he's offered the chance to live the &quot;high-life&quot; by providing services to Julian Poe, who delves into the illegal truffle trade. What ensues is truly high-comdey with a sprinkling of romance and French travelogue thrown in for good measure.                          <br />Overall, the characters are well-thought out and brought fully to life...plus, who could not enjoy a novel where the author is simply having such a wonderful time as Mr. Mayle obviously is! Highly recommended this is...and is there any chance of having this made into a film or BBC series?                            <br />A generous,delicious serving of Mr. Mayle!	2001-11-03

I'll begin this review by giving &quot;Hotel Pastis&quot; a total of SIX stars instead of the obligatory five. Stay with me and I'll explain why.<br />Being such an incredible fan of Mr. Mayle's previous books on Provence I was slighly apprehensive about his delving into the world of fiction. Untested waters to be sure but I held my breath and waited for &quot;Hotel Pastis &quot; to appear at my local book store. When it finally arrived I, without hesitation, picked up my copy and that evening sat down... ready to be disappointed.Obviously, quite the opposite has occured. Looking back over the past few years when I first read this novel I actually have to laugh at my apprehensiveness (ummm... is that a word?).<br />&quot;Hotel Pasts&quot; is, at least for me, one of the most enchanting, funny and in some small, strange way, romantic books I have read in many a year. Mr. Mayle simply makes you really care about the people that populate this book and you truly do want to see an &quot;happy-ending&quot;! The novel is written in an extremely fast-paced mode and moves along with the speed of sound! Never a dull moment! Without going into the plot of the novel, the main character Simon Shaw and his &quot;man Friday&quot; Ernest are both so cleverly drawn and fleshed out that I keep hopeing for a sequel to this work. Especially Ernest, part valet, part confidant, part friend and qualified Rolls-Royce mechanic is simply so fascinating that his character alone is worthy of a book.<br />Obviously,as in any Peter Mayle novel ( and in real life) things don't always go as intended for our &quot;heroes&quot; and that is where the fun truly begins. This book simply has it all...French comedy, romance, bumbling crooks, ex-wives, a malignant local journalist and, perhaps most important of all, the French country-side, in all it's glory. Perhaps, in some way, the villages of southern France are as much of the novel as the characters. Altogether an extemely well-rounded first novel that is as fruity and smooth as a bottle of pastis!<br />Do yourself a huge favor and run to your library or local book store and pick up your very own copy. I've bought countless copies as gifts and speaking for myself have read this wonderful book on 'six' seperate occassions. And while you're at it pick up a wonderful bottle of wine and an an Edith Piaf record. You may not be in France but...you certainly won't be home either!

US	43289735	R2WSIYL123UGNC	0679736042	161781952	Toujours Provence	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A Second Helping......Bon Appetit!	If you've ventured through my reviews previous to this you know of my deep seated love and enthusiasm for Mr. Mayle's first novel &quot; A Year In Provence&quot;. Being such a big fan I was more than slightly apprehensive when his second installment was released. I had prepared my self for a huge letdown!             <br />Fortunately, once again, I was wrong. Don't misunderstand me...while I enjoy this book immensely it simply doesn't match up to his first novel. The &quot;flow&quot; of the first novel isn't there and some pieces feel as though they've been plastered together. That being said...WHO CARES!                                    <br />Mr. Mayle's talent in story-telling is still with us and some of his chapters, such as hunting the elusive tuffle, attending a Pavorotti concert and digging up gold Naopoleon's in his own yard make for a wonderful adventure which I greatly enjoyed.     <br />Overall, the book has the same cozy, warm feeling that his first novel so vividly captured and I now have my own hardbound copy as well. But, than again, I'm biased! I tend to enjoy his novel's due to their naivete,innocence and of course his tendencies to expand upon French culture. What's not to like?    <br />So, if you enjoyed his first you will undoubtably like this as well. And if not....well, you wish to stay away. Overall, I think Peter Mayle has done us, and his bank account,a very big favor by letting us enjoy he and his wife's misadventure's in Provence and here's hopeing they'll be many more!	2001-10-28

I happened upon it when it first came out at my local library, thought it looked mildly amusing and took it home,expecting to be fairly entertained...but little more!<br />Since that fateful day I now have my own copy (hardbound, of course), have read this book, at last count, on five seperate occassions and have given away numerous copies to friends as gifts. Obviously, I am simply a HUGE fan of Mr. Mayle's novel. But it's difficult not to be!                 <br />Whether the book is accurate or not,and there's been some discussion of that, I 've found his &quot;innocent's abroad&quot; story funny and touching in many ways. It's a common dream that many of us have which is to run away to your own private paradise and simply live your life as you would wish. Only of course things are never that simple...especially with the Mayle's challenge of working with French beauracracy,builder's and the odd assortment of neighbor's and on-lookers. To say nothing of the occassional uninvited house guests!                                  <br />There's simply something here for everyone! And of course, an odd moral to their touching story, which I won't explain here...I'll let you discover on your own. So pick up a favorite bottle of wine, some Edith Piaf and sit down with this wonderful novel. Once you're hooked you'll be able to enjoy the sequel as well...&quot;Toujour's Provence&quot;! Bonjoir!!	2001-10-28
