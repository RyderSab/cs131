To me, he is the finest anglophone poet since Yeats.  Here is a beautiful collection of his complete poetry and his (admittedly, less interesting) prose works. Formidably difficult and elusive, Stevens' poetry also provides one of the most intense engagements with language that I know of.  This wonderful edition includes the early collection, &quot;Harmonium,&quot; with all of its colorful exoticism, the great &quot;Notes Towards a Supreme Fiction,&quot; and the profound late works such as &quot;Auroras of Autumn&quot; and &quot;The Rock.&quot;  These late poems in particular explore the unnameable, elusive quality of human experience (of time, the world, language, and being itself) in so many ways and with such brilliant use of poetic language that it leaves me, literally, speechless.  Granted, the poems are among the most challenging in English and are the very antithesis of the &quot;spontaneous&quot; writing of confessional and Beat poets.  They are studied and intricate, but they are also deeply, deeply great and moving.  As always, the Library of America edition is beautifully done and, unlike the paperback versions now available, will not yellow and decay in a matter of years.  It will take years to digest this work, so that's an enormous plus.	2004-06-28

Its technique is extremely subtle and overwhelmingly complex.  The novel is only partially &quot;plotted,&quot; but by this point in literary history, any reader who isn't prepared for this modernist playfulness shouldn't have picked up the novel in the first place.  There is an extraordinary ebb and flow of language that at times explores characters directly and at times is highly oblique and suggestive.  Perspectives are mixed; understandings (the narrator's, characters', and the readers') endlessly emerge, disappear, and return with great power.  More than anything, this fabulous work carries the reader through an intricate, extraordinarily nuanced journey of a world of deceivers and deceived.  The translation is a bit British for American readers, and it doens't always capture the very nuanced, elegant French Gide crafted so carefully.  But don't miss this radiant, highly challenging novel.	2002-11-18

It's absolutely terrific.  Unlike a lot a vegetarian recipes, these are very finely tuned, even subtle.  They aren't the easiest meals to put together, but the work is well worth it.  The recipes are constructed with a wonderful eye to fresh ingredients complexly combined, and it covers everything from breakfast to desserts.  The cornmeal pancakes remain the best I've ever had; salads are excellent; and the soups just as good. I really love this book and would never be without it.	2002-10-03

I find it fascinating reading,and if you're interested in learning about this (admittedly small) branch of Indian cooking, this is a good start.  Vedic cooking does not use onins, garlic, nightshade vegetables, and has some other restrictions.  In some ways, this does make for a blander product, and many of these recipes lack the initial &quot;punch&quot; so many of us are used to in Indian cooking.  But the author makes up for it with an extremely varied, almost dizzingyly broad array of ingredients and combinations that are both very exciting and very demanding.  The results, for me, have been very nice, but they come at a high price.  To put a meal together out of this book is a tremendous undertaking in time and ingredients, even for an experienced Indian cook.  The recipes can be extremely intricate and time consuming.  The result, however, is fresh, vibrant, and really quite unlike what you may be used to in Indian food.	2002-09-26

He was, after all, only five or six years old when it occured.  But the narrative is utterly absorbing.  Written by one of the greatest novelists of all time (he was Joyce's favorite English novelist), the narrative is vivid, moving, and sometimes hilarious.  It is also remarkably contemporary.  You meet quacks and prophets disturbingly similar to the no-nothings who dominate our own time.  The descriptions of behavior, disease, fear, and denial are as fresh today, and as relevant, as they were when Defoe wrote the Journal.  Don't miss it!	2002-03-28

As a law student, I was stunned by how few (and I mean FEW) people had put any thought at all into their decision to attend. I left my law practice to retain my sanity. For what it's worth, I urge anyone thinking of going to law school to read this book very carefully. There are very good reasons for becoming a lawyer, though making a lot of money is not one of them. Law school isn't that hard (try medical school . . .), but being a lawyer is very demanding indeed. It takes the right kind of person, and the right kind of motivation, to make it worthwhile. This book is an excellent start to deciding if you're one of those people.	2002-03-06

The study combines a careful reading of the cultural interactions that are so extraordinary in Melville's fiction before Pierre with a truly subtle attention to the text.  In my experience, this is an all too rare talent among contemporary critics, many of whom have lost all ability to handle the nuances of literary texts.  Melville's difficulties cannot be overstated.  This excellent reading brings these early texts to life in a startling, even exciting, way.  I highly recommend it.	2002-03-04

Her complete command of French cuisine makes most of today's media-crazed chefs look like amateurs.  This is a workable cookbook that is carefully laid out, with  many sauces that can be applied to a variety of dishes.  There is a wonderful range of dishes, from simple to complex.  You can start wherever you are comfortable and learn with this woman who probably knows more about food than anyone living. The techniques, which are at the forefront of everything Madeleine does, are straightforward and easily mastered.  Among the many, many pleasures of this spectacular book (in addition to the food, of course) is the sense of confidence it can give any aspiring cook to create extremely refined dishes without pretence or fear.  If you use this book, you really won't be able to look at most other books in the same way.  Fantastic!	2002-01-07

I seem to be somewhat less enthusiastic about this book than the other readers.  It's terrific, of course.  But I don't think it's as useful for a beginner as Morningstar's or some of the other ayurvedic cookbooks.  It can be challenging to determine what recipes are appropriate for your body type.  And, in frankness, Maharishi ayurved can be somewhat stricter in its definitions of balancing and aggravating foods than other forms of ayurveda.  That may be a positive, but it places greater burdens on the beginner.  Still, this is an inspiring and very beautiful book that I look forward to using for many years.	2001-04-09

Pagels shows how the gospels are embedded in their social and historical situations (especially the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans) and the ways in which the various gospels respond to the growing Jesus movement's strained relations with the Jewish community.  Although interesting, there is very little that is new here.  Indeed, much of the book is a basic rehashing of received ideas by scholars for some time.  Oddly, there is virtually nothing about Satan at all (other than a brief overview of the appearance of the name in the Hebrew Bible).  This is certainly not a scholarly investigation of the &quot;origin&quot; of the figure of Satan in the Bible or the culture(s) that produced it.  In that sense, it's extremely disappointing.  But for anyone unfamiliar with the ways in which the New Testament was written, this can be an easy and interesting introduction to Christian thought.	2000-10-17

Dramatically, most opera is essentially absurd.  Nineteenth century opera is largely based on dramatic forms that have not survived into this century and have primarily historical interest for scholars. No one, for example, would ever stage the kind of melodramas so popular in the preceding century with a serious expectation that an audience could enter into it in some dramatic sense. Neither can any kind of production, in itself, bring Il Trovatore (my favorite opera) &quot;alive&quot; for me or make me &quot;believe&quot; that the second act of Tristan and Isolde (my second favorite opera) is anything more than overblown romantic twaddle with a German transcendental twist.  Opera simply does not live in and through its silly plotting and narrative. Rather, it the the glory of the music, as it is realized through great voices, that makes these operas of real interest and gives them emotional power.  There is a wonderful video of Tebaldi and Corelli singing La Forza del Destino in Naples in front of a typical, old-style Italian set:  a painted curtain that looks like it's from a bad high school play.  Yet this video captures one of the most glorious moments of singing I've ever heard: huge, matchless voices singing Verdi's great music (and uttering the rather predictable words characteristic of melodrama).  It's the singing that brings this alive, and no production can have much of an effect without that as it's basis.  In an age where conductors are more intent on flying around the world rather than truly learning about voices, and few singers can even begin to match the great voices of the past, we might indeed look to the director to bring us relief from the second rate.  But Serafin didn't need a director to bring opera alive, and Callas didn't need a strange production to make us &quot;believe&quot; in opera.

And while many readers apparently find this refreshing and rewarding, I find it extremely frustrating.  There is little chronological coherence to the underlying &quot;narrative&quot; (such as it is) in this exceptionally selective retelling of Ottoman history.  Events and facts are frequently introduced as if the reader has long been familiar with them, when, in fact, they may be entirely new to her.  The book does give interesting insights to details of life, battle, etc. (to a degree), but I find it difficult to overvalue these when I can't really follow the underlying chain of events that make up the history of the Ottoman empire.  For me, this was a bit incoherent; for others with greater knowledge of these matters, it may be quite refershing and enlightenting.	2000-10-04

It  is extremely user-friendly.  The book lays out the fundamentals of the  planets, the constellations and all the major concepts required for someone  unfamiliar with jyotish to make sense out of a chart.  If there is a  problem here, I think it's because the book is not really very reflective  at all concerning the depth of meaning associated with the various aspects  of jyotish--but that's hardly a fair criticism given that it is designed as  a very general introduction.  I think it makes a useful reference for a  beginning student to look up general concepts, broad associations with  rashis, planet placement, etc., but it's very broadness makes it relatively  hard to use for more detailed analysis of charts.  \\"Light on  Life\\" remains my favorite introductory book, but, in all honesty, I  wish I had read this one first: it would have made reading \\"Light on  Life\\" a lot easier.

Although the setting is often the closed world of Poland's rural Jewish communities before the Nazi  invasion, these stories are replete with the most profound insights about  human nature that are universally applicable.  Told with dazzling skill,  and using a wonderful sense of realistic detail (including beautiful  descriptions of the natural world), these stories are rich, full and deeply  moving. Within the small communities Singer uses as his settings, he  explores faith, despair, love, longing, and above all else, loneliness, in  ways that are as moving as they are brilliant. Like Tolstoy, Singer is able  to explore these profound themes without the slightest pretension and  without writing &quot;philosophical&quot; prose.  Indeed, reading them is  like listening to a brilliant oral story teller who effortlessly draws you  into his tale--but then you realize you are, in fact, reading an  extraordinarily sophisticated text. This is some of the finest writing I've  read in many years and is one of those books I would take with me to that  desert island everyone talks about.	2000-07-10

Greatly ignored in its own day, and for much of ours, the  Confidence Man is central to an understanding of narrative history and the  evolution of this tortured genius who, after his novel Pierre, seems to  have transformed narrative conventions in a way that few readers have ever  grasped.

It  is almost inconceivable that Melivlle really believed that it would be  popular (which he did), for it shows the impossibility of writing as an  American author, the impossibility of originality, and the impossibility of  self-reliance.  Beware: it is not for the faint of heart.  It is demanding,  relentlessly challenging, and very rewarding.	2000-02-17

This work, however, revolutionized Melville studies by combining  historical, psychoanalytic and literary analysis in an exceptionally  illuminating manner.  It is without question the single best study of  Melville in the past thirty years.	2000-02-17

Like languages in India, it is impossible to make generalizations about Indian food because there are simply too many regional and ethnic variations.  This book presents a version of Indian food that is not as  familiar to an American audience as that presented in more mainstream  books.  That makes the recipes interesting and, at times, even startling.  My experience, however, is that it is more interesting to read than to use.  I frequently find the recipes not to be worth the (often considerable)  effort required.  But the recipes are intriguing and full of combinations I  would never have imagined.	1999-10-19

Even if you enjoy Alice Waters' predictable  discussions of eating what's locally available (has she ever had anything  else to say?), you might want more actual recipes before plunking down the  price of this tome.	1999-10-19

This is an extremely accessible and user-friendly vegetarian cookbook.  Unlike many others in it category--including most of the standard volumes--this book's recipes do not require elaborate preparations.  The  recipes are direct, workable, and excellent.  This wonderful book deserves  much greater name recognition than it seems to enjoy because, once it's  used, it will replace many of its better-known cousins.	1999-10-19

What can anyone really say about these fabuolous books? I've used these volumes since I was a college student in the 1970's.  Fashions have come and gone, and some trendy chefs like to call these recipes &quot;old  fashined.&quot;  That's amusing to me, because when today's (usually  idiotic) trends are forgotten, American cooks will still be using these  wonderful, wonderful books.  There really has never been anything like them  for an American cook.	1999-10-19

For anyone whose experience with cooking and food does not go back a few years, it is hard to imagine how inventive this book really is or how much it has changed cooking styles in this country.  I resisted my freinds'  enthusiasm for this book for several years, mistakenly imagining it to be  merely trendy or somehow not &quot;serious&quot; (although I never bothered  to read it).  But it is a truly imaginative and inventive book which is  striking even when it goes wrong.  Granted, some recipes are merely clever,  and some re-takes on classic standards are, frankly, not worth the effort.   But at its heart, the book has a consistent vision of food and cooking that  is interesting and often very, very good.  Even if you don't like the food,  the little annotations and comments are worth the price in themselves.	1999-10-19

I've been using this book for almost 20 years, and I can't imagine not having it for another 20 years.  It's a fantastic introduction to certain kinds of Indian food and is fully usuable by anyone not used to this  cuisine.  Be forewarned, however: if you cook from this book, you will have  a hard time being pleased by many Indian restaurants, few of which can  match the splended results even a novice Indian chef can accomplish using  this book.  I promise that if you make Madhur's tomato chutney, you will  never be able to eat anthing purchased in a jar again!	1999-10-19

This book purports to be a set of interviews with America's &quot;most important&quot; hatha yoga teachers, although many of the country's leading teachers are not included here.  The book could more properly be called  interviews with figures who have taken out the glossiest ads in the Yoga  Journal or who appear at the largest number of conferences.  Unfortunately,  the lack of discrimination in choosing teachers also spills over somewhat  in the interviews themselves.  The author repeatedly draws attention away  from the core issues of practice itself and allows the interviewees to  sidetrack him from a disciplined focus on yoga practice.  I keep getting  the sense of an interviewer who is not particularly experienced and is  somewhat &quot;star struck&quot; by talking with these figures.  However,  it's a valuable and interesting book; I just wish there was more real  substance to it.	1999-05-04
