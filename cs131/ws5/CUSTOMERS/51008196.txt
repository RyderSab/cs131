When I first picked up this book I thought, that since it was written by a woman to a woman audience, I would have little to no value reading it. BOY WAS I WRONG. Jennifer did an outstanding job showing us how chasing after traditional success (monetary success) eventually will leave us feeling very empty. And it so true, after we are able to pay all our bills and have a few dollars extra, what we really need to do is stop and think if chasing down another few bucks will bring us more happiness or not.  <br /> <br />There was a study I once read that stated: `to be happy you only need to make 40,000 a year' (yeah, it was written a little while ago... and I am sure we have to add a few dollars to make that more current, but the point is that as long as you are able to pay for a normal comfortable lifestyle, whether you are happy after that is completely unrelated to your income. Rather it all has to do with our attitude... and yet so many of us still think that more money will bring us more happiness! Why? Because we have been conditioned to think so.  <br /> <br />I urge you to read this book and see for yourself the powerful principles contained within. Jennifer has some talent... she inspires us to get in touch with our real self--our soul.

Vince Poscente has created a powerful little book that will propel you to be the best you can be.  Written as a quick read using an entertaining allegory between an ant and the elephant, the book contains strategic tools that you can use to create peak performers personally and personally.  <br /> <br />Vince also weaved in his great sense of humor that had me laughing out loud! The crux of the book is his five-step program that he calls the 5 C's. Here are the 5 C's that you will learn about in the Ant and the Elephant:  <br />      <br />1. Clarify your vision.  <br />Make fear your friend, not your master. You don't know what you don't know. Open your mind to discover possibilities that may not be obvious at the time. Zero in on a goal that has depth of meaning. The journey has to be worth taking. <br /> <br />2. Commit to cultivating positive dominant thoughts. <br />Shift beliefs, attitudes and truths so they are in alignment with your vision. Envision having the goal, rather than merely wanting the goal. <br /> <br />3. Consistently focus on performance. <br />Experience the goal as though it were happening right now. Show your gratitude consistently. <br /> <br />4. Strengthen confidence. <br />Frustration will lead to negative thoughts. Negative thoughts add fuel to more negativity. This negativity can be a pattern that destroys confidence. No two thoughts can occupy the mind at the same time. Replace negativity with positive, confident thoughts. <br /> <br />5. Control the response to any situation. <br />Unforeseen circumstances will arise. Expect the unexpected. Anticipate your response to challenges as well as your team's. <br /> <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works and founder of EmpoweringMessages.com <br />	2005-01-12

What I really like about this book, is that the authors do a wonderful job showing you how the super successful people had their starting points as well. They started with a dream, and then took action to follow though--to make their dream--their reality. <br /> <br />All too often we forget this simple truth.  <br /> <br />One of the greatest psychological discoveries of the twenty century was NLP. Anthony Robbins did a great job promoting its practical application for the masses. The essence of NLP is that if someone could do something, you could copy him and achieve the same results. <br /> <br />But beliefs need to start somewhere. That's where this awesome book comes in. it shows you in clear terms how other went from zero to stardom. Reading stories from the super successful will help you gain a strong belief in yourself. It will spark a flame of empowerment - that says \\"I too can be great!\\" Which reminds me of a great quote from Mark Twain that is very apropos: <br /> <br />\\"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.\\"  <br /> <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works <br />	2004-12-13

His tapes and audio programs bring empowerment to the young and old. I pray that someday I will be able to make a difference in the lives of other people the way that he did.<br /><br />In this book he outlines in clear terms what it takes to increase your salary, income and most important the quality of your life...to make you a well rounded success.

She illustrates her techniques in clear terms...leaving you with no room for doubt.  <br /> <br />As you already know, and most probably heard at some point in your life, that what we feed our minds becomes our reality. We can convince ourselves practically anything with enough verbal repletion of affirmations. <br /> <br />However how many of us actually act upon this? How many of us use this awesome power? And even when we do use this powerful technique, are we using it correctly? <br /> <br />For example if you want to quit your job because you can't stand it anymore, you should not say \\"I want to quit my job\\", because that is focusing on the negative. Rather you should state. \\"I look forward to successfully securing myself a position at another firm, in a job that I love!\\" <br /> <br />Also another powerful idea that is often overlooked that you got to be patient. As Wayne Dyer teaches: \\"Infinite patience produces immediate results.\\" <br /> <br />The bottom line is, we can submit any of our heart deepest desires to our Cosmic Chef (\\"our higher power\\") and He will process and answer all of our requests. <br /> <br />If you are unhappy with your life (which means your are producing negative results) its because at some level you are feeding this order into the cosmic chef. If your fear of not achieving your goal is greater and your faith of achieving it, then the winner will be the stronger emotion.

A book that quantifiably proves the power of positive thinking, in quantifiable, measurable psychological studies. <br /> <br />I really love this book. Wow, What a simple concept. When you're feeling high your invisible bucket is full, when your feeling low--your bucket is empty....and when you interact with others you are either filling your bucket and theirs OR you are emptying your bucket and theirs. Its amazing how simple and true this idea is. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I started rating my interactions with each person I dealt with throughout the day. I put a number on the amount of drops each person gave me (or took away from me) It was an amazing experience. Finally I understood why I felt so down after just saying hello to an extremely negative person. I would go into such a bad mood out of the blue.  <br /> <br />Let me give you an example. The other day when working through an issue with someone who was having difficulty with his system; I starting  helping him, but things weren't going fast enough for him, so he started to use all kinds of  swear words because his program wasn't working.  <br /> <br />I started to feel uncomfortable and my mind filled up with thoughts of negativity. Why? Because his negative energy! He was emptying my bucket! Yes, swearing is a form of negative energy. And when it's said in anger it very destructive too! <br /> <br />On the other hand, the other day when I met someone on the street whom I did not see in awhile...when she greeted me with a nice big friendly 'hello! How are you?' and began telling me how her day went, her positive energy literally filed my bucket. I felt really happy and motivated after talking to her. She was full of positive energy and her bucket was so overflowing that--she couldn't help but put me in a good mood. (By the way, come to think of it, I never heard her complain about anything--even when things weren't going very well for her. She is one of those extremely positive type of people. She must be filling buckets all day long!) <br /> <br />Another bucket filling example. When I was asked to provide feedback (work performance) on someone people I had to worked with on various projects, I put down some real positive stuff for a guy that really deserved it. He is also one of those happy, great attitude type kind of people. Anyways as a kind gesture I emailed him what I wrote. <br /> <br />A few days later, I met him in the hallway and he told me that he appreciated the kind words I wrote on behalf of him so much that he printed it out and brought it home to show his wife! I was amazed. I thought I was giving him a pat on the back--but he took it as if I was giving him a badge of honor! I felt so good that I went home and told my wife, who was so impressed by me that and she started filling my bucket!  <br /> <br />Yes, this book may be short, but don't confuse the amount of pages with value.

At a time where everyone wants equality for the sexes, it's vital to be aware of our naturally different temperaments.<br />In today's society, where we try to give everyone equal rights, equally chance, equal opportunities, we tend to forget that we are different. Books like this one by Dr Gray, remind us that no, you can't treat everyone the same. There is no total equality. Men will be men, and women will be woman.<br />And especially when it comes to intimate relationships between man and wife; how much more crucial it is--to be cognizant of one another's psychological differences and respect each other's natural needs, desires and wants. <BR>Highly recommended. <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated<br />PS here is a cheat sheet for reviewing the ideas in the book at a glace.<br />Differences men/women<br />Men Need:<BR>1.

A must read for any parent, teacher or coach.

Fulfilling his purpose on this world. I wish there were more like him. We need more teachers who are teaching out of love. That's why he is so effective.

They want the money too quickly<BR>2. They don't think like a business owner. Marketer. Salesperson.<br />For example, my motivational role model Jack Canfield, back in 1992 thought up an idea of compiling emotional stories about overcoming obstacles and living your dream, (that turned into chicken soup for the soul mega best-selling series). But what is most remarkable is that Mark V Hanson, who joined him, was the key to making the series into a MONEY MAKING PROPOSITION. You see I think that Jack was doing it for the love of helping people and then the money, while Mark was doing it for the money then the love. Don't get me wrong. Mark V Hanson is a great I guy. He is not at all a money hungry charlatan. He is interested in helping people change their lives. However compared to Jack, he is more interested in making money.<br />The bottom line is do what you love, but if then money is not following, get a partner, a salesperson, someone to market your skills. Hope that helps. <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated	2004-03-18

This book shows you how to improve your relationships. Even if you currently have a great relationship-you can still learn a thing or two from this neat little book on how to make it an even better relationship. Easy read. Highly recommended. <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated<br />PS here is a sample (Secret number 1)<br />The Mundane Is Heroic<br />Some tasks we think of as difficult and their achievement noteworthy. Others we think of as boring and their achievement insignificant. Of course, the tasks that are noteworthy are often built on a foundation of the mundane. Firefighters study lifesaving techniques and firefighting protocols for years on end, and then one day they are called on to use their skills and knowledge to save a building and the people in it. Without the years of mundane commitment, there would be no moment of great achievement. We recognize that having a long-standing healthy relationship is an achievement. If you are married long enough, the local newspaper will take your picture and write up your story. But that achievement is built on a nearly infinite series of actions, including a daily, hourly, moment-to-moment commitment to each other. It is certainly not always easy, and the rewards are not always immediately apparent, but sacrificing your immediate preferences and being committed to sharing, caring, and listening are mundane but heroic steps toward your lifetime relationship goal.<br />- - -<br />Even before they dated, Kathy and William began working out together. Later, after they married, their interest and success in running led them to set a goal of running together in the Boston Marathon. After training for three years together working toward that goal, Kathy's best time qualified her for the race and William's did not.<br />William could have reacted in a variety of ways, all of them perfectly normal, given human nature. He could have wallowed in self-pity, dragging bothhimself and his wife down and making her feel somehow guilty for his exclusion. He could have asked Kathy to wait until they could run together. He could have resented his wife's ability to achieve and tried to sabotage her.<br />&quot;A big part of me wished I was out there running the marathon, of course,&quot; admitted William. &quot;So what did I do on race day? I went out to five or six locations and cheered her on.&quot; William chose to encourage rather than discourage. &quot;I lived vicariously through her. Her success is my success.&quot;<br />William says that in working out together, as in life together, jealousy, envy, and other unpleasant emotions can visit relationships, but the most important thing to remember is that &quot;we're a team every day -- race day, too. We have to be able to give each other the freedom to be able to develop our own talents. To not stand in each other's way, but to stand with each other, helping if we can, watching if we can't.&quot;<br />- - -<br />The ability to maintain open, healthy communication in a relationship is associated with strong levels of such highly regarded personal qualities as self-restraint, courage, generosity, commitment to justice, and good judgment. --Fowers 2001	2004-03-16

Reading how the greatest motivational speakers motivate themselves--gets me motivated! <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated<br />PS I am a big fan of Jack Canfield. There is a lot of stuff from him and Mark V Hanson in this book. For example, here is a little excerpt from Jack:<br />\\"At my seminar I do a section on `discovering your life's purpose'. We start off by hitting it from the external, then we eventually approach it from the inside. We get them to answer questions like: Who are you envious of? <br />I was envious of Kenny Rogers, the singer. I had to ask myself, what is it I am envious of? One, he brings pro-athletes down to his ranch in Virginia. He's got a football field, a baseball diamond, a basketball court, tennis court, all built in. He brings in John McEnroe from the tennis world, Larry Byrd from the Pacers, football players. They divide up into teams and have a mini Olympics type event all week. They play all day, then at night they get massages and have gourmet meals. Kenny is also a great portrait photographer, so he takes pictures of everyone. I thought, what is it that I envy about that? I realized it is that I love hanging out with people who are the best at what they do. It helped me realize my passion is for information, for sharing, for generosity, for making a difference.<br />I start with the envy question, then I ask, 'Think back in your life, when did you feel most alive? When did you feel most happy? When did you feel most loved? What was your greatest success? What was it about that success that made it a success?' As they answer these, people start to see some patterns<BR>.<BR>Finally, we ask, 'Who do you admire most on the planet alive or dead? If you could be anyone on the planet, who would you be?' If someone says Tony Robbins, that is a real different statement than Mother Teresa. It helps define what they want to express.<br />With their eyes closed I havethem imagine they are climbing a mountain, they go into a temple, and this wise person comes and brings them a gift. As they open the gift, it will symbolically represent their life's purpose. People open it and get things like a children's book, this because they are supposed to write a children's book. Some get little poor kids looking up a them with hope, this because they are supposed to go empower those kids. People get in touch with their passion and their purpose.\\" --Jack Canfield	2004-03-16

This is a good book loaded with many great ideas on how to overcome your inner critic. Read it and apply it today!<br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works<br />PS here is a great story that is in the begining of this book: <br />What Is Your Inner Critic and Where Did It Come From?<br />On the journey of self-discovery, let us stop looking for what is wrong with us. Let us discover, instead, who we are and how we work! Let us put our judgment aside as we explore the amazing system Of selves within us and learn to live with ever-increasing honesty, choice, and freedom.<br />There was once a dreadfully wicked hobgoblin. One day he had a simply marvelous idea. He was going to make a looking glass that would reflect everything that was good and beautiful in such a way that it would look dreadful or at least not very important. When you looked in it, you would not be able to see any of the good or the beautiful in yourself or in the world. Instead, this looking glass would reflect everything that was bad or ugly and make it look very important. The most beautiful landscapes would look like heaps of garbage, and the best people would look repulsive or would seem stupid. People's faces would be so changed that they could not be recognized, and if there was anything that a person was ashamed of or wanted to hide, you could be sure that this would be just the thing that the looking glass emphasized.<br />The hobgoblin set about making this looking glass, and when he was finished, he was delighted with what he had done. Anyone who looked into it could only see the bad and the ugly, and all that was good and beautiful in the world was distorted beyond recognition.<br />One day the hobgoblin's assistants decided to carry the looking glass up to the heavens so that even the angels would look into it and see themselves as ugly and stupid. They hoped that perhaps even God himself would look into it! But, as they reached the heavens, a great invisible force stopped them and they dropped the dreadful looking glass. And as it fell, it broke into millions of pieces.<br />And now came the greatest misfortune of all. Each of the pieces was hardly as large as a grain of sand, and they flew about all over the world. If anyone got a bit of glass in his eye there it stayed, and then he would see everything as ugly or distressing. Everything good would look stupid. For every tiny splinter of the glass possessed the same power that the whole glass had!<br />Some people got a splinter in their hearts, and that was dreadful, too, for then their hearts turned into lumps of ice and could no longer feel love.<br />The hobgoblin watched all this and he laughed until his sides ached. And still the tiny bits of glass flew about, And now we will hear all about it....<br />Adapted from &quot;The Snow Queen,&quot;by Hans Christian Andersen<BR>The Inner Critic is like the bit of mirror that makes us see a distorted picture. It is that inner voice that criticizes us and speaks about us in a disparaging way. It makes everything look ugly. Most of us are not even aware that it is a voice or a self speaking inside of us because its constant judgments have been with us since early childhood and its running critical commentary feels like a natural part of ourselves. It develops early in our lives, absorbing the judgments of the people around us and the expectations of the society in which we live. When we talk about this critical voice, please keep in mind that this Inner Critic is the voice within us that criticizes us, whereas the Judge is the self within us that criticizes other people.	2004-03-16

WHY? Because the Government says so. (That's because it's a matter of life and death and the government wants to protect you)<br />When it comes to investing, it's not that way. While I am not proposing the government to tell you what to read, (I love the freedom that I am provided with in the USA) I must say that people should become more learned about investments before putting their hard earned money in stocks. <br />I watched too many people BET their life savings on the stock market during the late 1990's, only to be heartbroken and dead broke when the bubble crashed. Reading books like this one, and applying its principles--will help you become a winning stock market investor.

As a success coach people come to me for help on how to improve their lives. Often I hear people asking WHY. They complain and bemoan their current terrible financial state or the fact that they are 50 or 100 pounds overweight. I advise them to read this book and stop asking why and start asking how. This is the best book that I am currently aware of dealing with problem. <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated	2004-03-09

I love the story about the NYC train system. I grew up during the 1980's and I remember being afraid to ride the subways. I recall watching people jump the turnstiles like there was no tomorrow. Even people that were considered honest nice guys would jump, because everyone else was doing it. When the police first started cracking down on these guys, I couldn't believe it, little did I know that I was watching the tipping point of the whole quality of life for a NY straphanger commuter. Because once the police started doing this, many problems that were much bigger--went away on their own.<br />This is just one story, there are many more great stories like this-in this really great book. I highly recommended it. <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated	2004-03-09

Randy outlines in this book in clear terms what is takes to be success bound, successful.  What makes this book unique is that it's written by someone who really lives this stuff. If you contact Randy and talk to him for just a few minutes you will see exactly what I mean. <br />By the way, Randy is a devout Christian, and he uses many verses from the old and the new testament as references in his book.  I happen to like his spiritually and appreciate his dedication to his religious beliefs--even though I am not a Christian, I am a Jewish soul. <br />To achieve success, you need to read books like this one. I highly recommend you reading this book. <br />This book helped me become more proactive! <br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated	2004-03-08

In order to be successful you have to think positive, you got to believe in yourself. <br />What makes this book remarkable is that it was written way back in the early 1900's, way before the surge of motivational and positive thinking era that we live in today. <br />Being a life coach, it amazes me how many people easily believe that they will fail, and that they have no chance of being successful. This is baloney. You can succeed. You can improve your life and well-being. You too can achieve greatness. Books like this one show you exactly how to do just that.

The one good thing I learned from this book is that to be successful you have to live with the motto \\"it shall be done\\".<BR> <BR>While the author thinks this is a great motto to live by, I question if this is really a good motto for someone to live by.<br />For example if you want to make 10 sales each day, and you work 14 hours a day to make it happen every day for years on end - thereby forgetting about your family and relationships, you may have attained wealth, but you will not have a balanced life.<br />Ok. You get my point. It's good to be a go-getter, but you need a balance too.<br />I highly recommend you read Cheryl Richardson's book, Take Time For Your Life, together with this one.<br />Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated	2004-03-05
