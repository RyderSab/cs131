I picked up this book without any specific expectations of what it would be, and was splendidly suprised.  Unlike many of the others who have reviewed this book, I have to say that I thought the ending was perfect, and I would have been disappointed by any other ending; a happy ending would not suit everything that preceded it, and a sad ending would be too heartbreaking to bear.  What else was he to do?<BR>This story follows &quot;The Life &amp; Times of Sugar,&quot; a 19-year-old prostitute, as she transitions from a street prostitute to a &quot;kept&quot; woman, and finally, to a governess.  The cast of characters, and the subplots they are involved in, are somewhat complex.  But, Farber spends as much time fleshing out the secondary characters as he does the protagonist, which helps keep the reader engaged.  <BR>I love historical fiction, especially when it's so well-written that it draws the reader into the time and space being written about.  In The Crimson Petal &amp; The White, Michael Farber creates &amp; literally (via the narrator)invites the reader to step into Victorian London, painting a three dimensional scene that contains both the bright, embellished locales of the Upper class and the brutal and filthy streets of the Lower class.	2004-04-06

This was one of those books that, as soon as I finished, I wanted to turn right back to page one and start all over again.  Middlesex is a highly complex, carefully crafted story that can not be easily summarized on the dustjacket flap or the back of the book.  Such a summary makes it sound somewhat kinky or wierd.  Anything but!  All one has to do is get through the first couple of pages, and any hesitancy has evaporated.  In a story spanning three generations, Cal, the main character, delves into a detailed history of a very complex family.  Only through the exploration of his past can he, and the reader, accept and understand who he is.  This book is filled with strength and love, and, when you turn the last page, just like me, odds are you'll want to start all over again on page one.  A stunning and superb masterpiece of a book.  I can't wait to read more of Jeffrey Eugenides.  He will be a celebrated author for generations to come.	2004-03-05

The main character, Poppy is a woman that you will love to hate.  Uneducated, spoiled, and self-absorbed, she is also fun, impulsive, and hedonistic.  Born into an affluent family in the early 1900s, she experiences all of the highlights of the 20th century; the sinking of the Titanic, 2 World Wars, Vietnam.  She bounces through life with a carefree, unconcerned attitude, and, in spite of herself, everything always seems to work out in the end.  There were times when I found myself disliking Poppy so much, I wondered if I wanted to finish the book.  A few pages more, though, and I'd have forgotton all about how much she ticked me off and get caught up in her next adventure.  Now, don't we all know people just like that??<BR>Don't let yourself get too caught up in the historical details of this book.  After all, it is just fiction!  Let go a little, and, hopefully, you'll enjoy this as much as I do.	2004-03-05

In a boyhood moment of adventure, Macky and his brother accidentally commit murder one night and set off a series of events so violent that it changes life in this tiny backwater forever.  Tooch Bedsole, brother of the murdered politician/store owner, takes over the store and makes it a center of power for the gang that calls itself &quot;Hell at the Breech,&quot; and proclaims the townies the sworn enemy, killers of his brother, Arch.  Macky, in reparation for the debt his adoptive grandmother ran up at the general store under the previous owner, is assigned to work for Tooch until the debt is paid off, and is therefore caught up in the increasingly violent activities of the gang.  The story reaches a page-turning climax when over 40 men ride out to Mitcham Beat from town to put an end to the lawlessness in a brutal battle scene.<BR>The setting and characters in Hell at the Breech are mean, dismal, and poverty stricken, but Franklin's writing style so strikingly beautiful that the reader is entranced, caught between a world both beautiful &amp; ugly at the same time.  In prose-like sentences, Franklin weaves a tale based on actual events and gives the world a wonderfully complex and compelling novel.  This book is highly recommended!!	2004-01-27

Mary Boleyn, like her sister Anne and brother George, has spent virtually her entire life in the Royal Court, and the siblings are well educated on how to mask their inner emotions and desires with a courtiere's smile.  Dominated by an ambitious uncle, they are each directed to play roles that will advance the family's status.  After Mary's relatively brief affair with King Henry VIII, she is supplanted by her sister Anne, and Mary is reunited with the husband she had been married to, but separated from, since she was 12 years old.  After his sudden death from disease, she meets and falls in love with a man of whom her family would never approve.  Eventually, as things slowly start to disintegrate for her sister Anne, Mary finally finds the courage to separate herself from her family and leave the royal court behind to join the man she has married for love.  I love reading a good historical novel, and this book was no exception.  Philippa Gregory does a fantastic job of developing characters, setting, and plot to keep the reader engaged from beginning to end.	2004-01-14

A couple of years ago, a friend recommended Dan Brown's 'Angels &amp; Demons' to me, which I read and thoroughly enjoyed.  Because of that, 'Da Vinci Code' was a must read for me.<br />The story really gets started in the Louvre, with the mysterious and gruesome death of a curator, along with a secret post mortem message delivered via Mona Lisa. From here the adventure begins, and the reader is whisked on a whirlwind tour of Europe in an exciting quest to solve a mystery that has haunted generations.<br />I enjoyed the first half of the book tremendously.  The plot moves quickly, keeping the reader engaged, and the characters are fairly well developed.  The story line was, at times, a little over the top.  But, hey, this is fiction, so why not?<br />In the second half of the book, Dan Brown seemed to lose the momentum he had built up.  I didn't lose interest completely, but had definite moments of ennui.  He wrapped up the story just in the nick of time.  Overall, I really enjoyed the story, and definitely had developed a very strong interest in the history  and myster of Mary Magdalene.<br />On a fun little side note, some time after finishing the book, I found this website ([...]) which provided a great afternoon's entertainment of mystery solving.	2003-12-11

Although Lily witnessed her mother die, she was too young to remember it clearly, and is tortured by thoughts and seeming evidence that she is responsible for her mother's death.  Her search for the truth, for her mother's roots, and for herself, leads her to Tiburon, South Carolina, where she meets the women who will guide her on her inner journey to adulthood.<br />While the book is definitely peopled with some very stereotyped characters, the focus remains on Lily's struggle to free herself from her past, rise above the racial tensions of the time, and become her own person.<br />I picked up a copy of this book to take with me as beach reading during my recent honeymoon, and by midway through I couldn't put it down.  Luckily, my husband is an avid reader too, so he understood!  I really did enjoy this book, but would recommend that if you are considering reading it, be aware that there are definite racist stereotyping undertones in the development of some of the characters, placed there by the author, I believe, as a vehicle for the plot development.	2003-12-02

I was not mistaken!!  This book took me in from page one, where we are introduced to Mary as a little girl already troubled by visions.  The story is well developed in the early part of the book, keeping your interest &amp; developing strong characters that help you keep turning pages through the second half of the book.  This is important, because the second half of the book, which is yet another retelling of the passion of Jesus in which the reader could easily lose interest unless there's something to keep a focus. While George's character of Mary Magdalene is complete fiction, she does create a believable &amp; likeable woman whose faith leads her on an extraordinary path.

Following the tradition of book one, The Winter King, and book two, Enemy of God, the story teller, Derfel, picks up the tale where it left off at the end of book two.  Derfel is a Saxson slave who grew up in Merlin's compound and joined Arthur's warriors as a young man, worked his way up through the ranks to become a Lord, and became Arthur's friend and trusted companion. His loyalty to Arthur stretched through his whole life, and he may be the last living person who can tell the tale the way it really happened.  <BR>Now, late in his life, Derfel is living as a monk, and retelling the tale to Queen Igraine.  Unlike the songs of the bards, who have earned their livlihood by embellishing these ancient tales with glory and beauty, Derfel tells it like it happened.  When all is said and done, this proves to be even more fascinating than the bards retelling.  Filled with pagan magic, cunning kings, brave warriors, and strong and beautiful women, this gripping tale will keep you turning pages to the very end!  If you love Arthurian legend, then I would recommend that you buy the whole trilogy today.  An excellent read from beginning to end.	2002-12-06

The trilogy presents the entire Arthurian Legend from a unique perspective.  Erasing the images of a beautiful and pure Camelot, dashing, handsome knights gallant, and even the famous \\"Round Table\\", Cornwall tells the tale based on the reality of life in Medievil times.  It's a gritty but fascinating revisitation of an ancient legend.  <BR>I expected the Enemy of God would have the classic lull that many #2s in a trilogy suffer, but was pleased to find it as gripping as the first book.  In the Winter King, the tale is told by a slave[] warrior,[] lord,[] monk: Derfel, who, in his old age, is retelling the tale of old to Queen Igraine.  He picks up the tale in The Enemy of God, seamlessly weaving book one into book two.  Igraine, who has been steeped in the glorious Arthurian Legend, is sometimes at odds with Derfel's retelling, which gives him the opportunity to break through the embellishments of the bards over the years and tell her what really happened.  This was a fantastic tale, and a wonderful read.  If you enjoy Arthurian tales, this book is highly recommended.	2002-12-06

The main character, Ninah, lives in a restrictive cult society created by her Grandpa Herman, the patriarch of the family and self-proclaimed leader of the The Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind.  The rules laid down for living in this group go unchallenged by the family, despite the severity of the punishments.  As Ninah passes through adolesence, she is tortured by the conflict created between her growing feelings of sexuality and her fear of God.  When she is caught administering her own \\"punishment\\", in which she has put broken nut shells in her shoes to remind her of the suffering of Jesus, she is assigned to pair with a young man as her \\"Prayer Parnter.\\"  The consequences lead to chaos, and ultimately to the end of the cult.  <BR>Reynolds' incredibly complex characters are what make this story fascinating.  Their actions and the motivations behind them are so well written that the reader can develope an sympathy for each of the characters, even the dictatorial and almost irrational Grandpa Herman.<BR>I thought this was an amazing book.

Sibyl Danforth is a very experience midwife, but the combination of a winter storm that ices the roads and cuts phone service, and a mother in a labor that goes suddenly wrong leads Sibyl to make a very difficult choice.  Sure that the mother has died, Sibyl performs an emergency CSection, and in doing so, saves the baby.  However, it doesn't take long for questions to arise.  Was the mother truly dead?  The husband and Sibyl's apprentice think not.  The medical community would like nothing better than to discredit the practice of home birth once and for all, and the Danforth family soon find themselves struggling to deal with the possibility that Sibyl will be sent to prison. This is a very emotionally charged subject and was a fascinating look at the somewhat mysterious occupation of midwifery.  The author, Chris Bohjahlian, develops the plot and characters with a great deal of careful insight and sensitivity.  The perspective of the narrator, in her early teens, is a well chosen aspect from which to deliver this tale, and the closure given at the end of the book was realistic and well written.  I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it.	2002-09-10

Junger obviously put in a lot of research effort and, although there are long passages of the book that are \\"factoidal\\" and somewhat tiring, these segments do add to the reader's understanding of all the elements that make up this story--endless dissertations on weather patterns, the history of fishing and it's dangers and rewards in the Northeast, how it might feel to die of drowning, etc.  I found the most interest in the operations of the Coast Guard.  The training of the Jumper Pilots, the dedication to their work that drove them to risk (and in the case of one of them, lose) their lives in this storm is amazingly altruistic and humane.  It took me a while to get through this book, but it was worth the read.	2002-08-25

When a chain of grisly murders threaten to shut down the celebration scheduled to debut the exhibit, an intense investigation begins while Museum official pull strings to ensure that the party will go on.  Human mistakes lead to a disasterous failure of Museum security features, and the hunt is on.  These two authors have delivered many superb books, but this was heads and tales above the rest.  The plot is well put together, and endlessly suspensful.  The setting is perfectly creepy, from the long dusty back halls of the museum to the tunnels and sewers below that provide a haven for the museum beast and ultimately an escape for the unfortunate characters that are being ruthlessly hunted.

Carrie Bell is Mike's high-school sweetheart, and now, having finished college, the obvious next step is marriage.  Everyone expects it, and Carrie feels unsure and trapped as the book opens. Packer jumps right into the thick of the plot in the first chapter, when Mike suffers an injury in a freak accident diving from Claussen's Pier at a picnic.  The accident renders Mike a quadroplaegic, and Carrie wondering what to do.  Filled with guilt, desperately trying to meet everyone's expectations, Carrie eventually cracks and makes a midnight flight from Madison, WI to New York City in an effort to save herself.  Ann Packer has tackled a very tough topic, and her resulting story is a realistic and heart-wrenching tale.  Although at times I disagreed with the decisions the characters make at some points in the story, I thought the characters well-developed and very true to life.

The insight into Communist life behind the Iron Curtain is detailed and fascinating, and Clancy masterfully creates psychological suspense as the sub crew, moving steadily west, is led to believe that they have been exposed to a radiation leak.  <BR>The book stumbles in the middle when Clancy fragments the story in quick, two page sections between too many perspectives.  While the plot moves forward, it becomes difficult to keep track of the ever-growing cast of non-relevent characters.  In addition, Clancy becomes somewhat burdened by his love of sharing his technical knowledge of military equipment and strategy in general.  Although I understand that 50% of the population - men - may revel in the amount of detail he provides, I felt that it detracted from the overall story.<BR>It's difficult in this day and age to imagine what this period in (recent) history was like, since the world has changed so dramatically in such a short period of time.  This book draws a brilliant picture of the strained relationship that dominated diplomatic relations of this era.  <BR>Clancy offers a well thought out plot and lots of action.

Cromwell weaves a fascinating and highly detailed tale that blows the fairy tale of traditional Arthur to pieces. Arthur will not pull a sword from a stone.  Guinevere seduces Arthur away from his betrothed in a sudden elopement.  Lancelot is a selfish, narcissistic, spoiled prince. And don't be flipping through the pages looking for Camelot, it doesn't exist.  But don't despair!  The story unfolds as told through the eyes Derfel, a Saxson slave who rises to the rank of Lord through his service as a warrior.  Derfel's telling is earthy and detailed, bringing to life for the reader the gritty realities of day-to-day life as it must have been in this period of history, and this is the most engaging factor of this book.  The struggle between the newly emerging Christian religion and the established Druids is a fascinating sub-current throughout the book.  Cornwell includes a map of Ancient Britian at the back of the book, which I referred to often and was very helpful in keeping track of &quot;where&quot; the story is taking place, since the names are not familiar to modern day Britain.

Now, I wasn't able to find that edition of the book, but trust me, if you can find it, it is worth it!  Since I had already heard Amy's mom on NPR, I read the book superimposing her voice in my head as I as I read the messages, which made it WAY funnier.  I'm passing this book around to all my friends, it's a lot of fun!	2002-06-06

Based on a type-written account of a long oral history, written by a relative in the mid-70's, and augmented with her exhaustive research and rich imagination, she has created a novel of the south from a perspective rarely presented; the woman of color around the turn of the century.  Within the characters of this book (who are also the women of her family going back generations), she captures a range of emotions, hopes, prejudices, that sometimes appear to be at odds to each other, but nonetheless are not so extraordinary.  She deals with the topic of racism in a very straight forward way.  The characters are not necessarily forgiving, but neither are they outraged.  The focus is on making tomorrow better for the family, not to change the world.  Because of this, her telling of this story struck a chord in me, and I couldn't easily put the book down.  I especially liked the pictures, and wished that there had been more.  It was kind of neat, as you read about these people and got to know their characters, to flip to a picture of them and just examine it for a few minutes.	2002-05-24

It was amazing how well he recreated the days of our childhood in the 1970s (I'm guessing we're close in age), from the shag carpeting, record players, and flower power stickers, to how it felt to be the odd kid out while waiting for the day camp bus!  However, it is more than just his ability to set a scene--it's hi ability to capture the universality of being a boy struggling with the transition of becoming a man.  Being a female, cannot comment on it from personal experience, but as the mother of a 13 year old and a 9 year old son, I can say that I paused many times while reading this  book to reflect on my own sons and the turbulence that becoming a teenager has wreaked on all of our lives!!  What I enjoyed most about the book was that it wasn't really about Jeremy's father dying, it was about everybody else living.  Beautiful work, really I can't tell you how touching it was.  I will look forward to future works from Steinberg.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone!	2002-05-20
US	43020520	R1CIBNWYOFTT4W	0375724931	794119090	The Bridegroom: Stories	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Unusual Insight	Ha Jin's collection of short stories are each a fascinating little slices of life from a society that is completely foreign to our own Western society.  The combination of the Chinese outlook on life and a communistic society sometimes flow in sync, and sometimes seem to be completely at odds.  But each of these stories gives the reader an opportunity to see the characters struggle with basic human emotions as they struggle to transcend the social and political mores and rules that litter the paths of their lives.  Although the culture is not one with which the average western reader can identify, the characters, in the end, are universal, and that is what pulls the reader into their stories.  At times absurdly funny, at times poignantly sad, the stories are direct, fast-paced, and interesting.   I enjoyed this collection very much!	2002-04-28

Grant, a college graduate, and has returned to be a teacher. Jefferson, locked up and sentenced to die, is a hopeless young man with no future. But society has cast the same burden of racism upon the two young African-American men that makes them equals in the eyes of the White beaurocracy. Grant reluctantly agrees to spend time with Jefferson throughout the trial period at the request of Jefferson's grandmother, who wants only that her grandson die with dignity and pride. She is convinced that Grant, as an educated black man, can teach Jefferson the lessons he needs to be \\"a man\\" before he is executed. Throughout, Grant struggles with his own unwillingness, with racism, and with his own emotions, and in the end finds that he learned the real lessons. Although at its root a tale about racism, the story transcends racism and distills the idea that the best lessons in life are not always the easiest ones to learn. The story is beautifully written, populated by strongly written characters and evoking for the reader a powerful picture of time and place. The plot is well-paced and keeps the reader interested. This is an excellent story that will keep you thinking long after you close the back cover.	2002-04-28

I zipped through the first half of the story, as it was engaging and interesting.  Ruth Cole and Eddie O'Hare form the core of the story, as Eddie (a young, aspiring writer who takes a summer job working as a writer's assistant to Ruth's alcoholic father, Ted) gets involved in a sexual relationship with Ruth's mother.  The impact of this interlude on all of the characters echoes throughout their lives.  However, Eddie's undying love and devotion, decades (and many, many pages) later, is a little too much for the reader to believe (or care about).  Ruth's relationship with her best friend, Hannah, is bizarre and unfounded, and exemplifies the weak character development that is encountered throughout the book.   No one can say that John Irving's writing in general leaves anything to be desired, but this story left me cold.  The plot, well developed in the first half of the books, plods through the second half, and the ending was boring and predictable	2002-04-28

Thanks a lot, James, now please call my boss and explain why I showed up late, with bags under my eyes!<br />The early chapters seemed reminiscent of his other three books, and I didn't want to see the people and setting change, but the basic story remain the same as some of his earlier works.  I'm glad that I decided to reserve judgment.  This story is a unique work unto itself, and it really gripped me.<br />Now, I'm not a reviewer who will summarize the plot for you (if I tell you everything that happens, why would you then need to read it??).  But I will tell you that James creates a very real picture of the Amazon in his story telling, and then adds a sense of the fantastic (personally, I loved the Piranhas with legs who ravenously chase our heroic team through a terrifying night!). He reveals rich knowledge of botany and holistic healing in his story telling that balances the art of the shaman with the quest of major pharmaceutical companies all over the world.  The amount of research work that went in to building this story is apparent, and suggests quite a bit of dedication on Mr. Rollins' part toward his chosen occupation.<br />In fact, when I finished the book, I turned back to the front to read his acknowledgements, and was surprised to see an acknowledgement for someone who assisted him with the French phrases in the book (which consisted mostly of 'mes amis' and 'mon dieu'), but no acknowledgement for the indigenous Amazon Indian phrases he uses--so are they real?  I would have loved to seen a prologue to the book giving us more detail on some of his work on in.  Maybe next time?  In the meantime, I recommend this book very highly! One of the best reads I've had in quite a while.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!	2002-04-19

The writing was quite good, but the plot was so sad that by the middle of the book I couldn't read a page at a time without feeling like crying.  I put it down halfway through, waiting for a day where I am unbearably ecstatically happy and need a little misery to bring me down.  That day hasn't happened yet, but I am prepared for it nonetheless.  Dave Eggers seems so young to write such a heartbreaking story!  I hope he cheers up soon.	2002-04-19

Because the ending is so unsatisfyingly and startlingly sudden!  After several hundred pages of building a wonderful plot and the characters, it is always a surprise to me when an author chooses to quit writing the book at the pentultimate chapter. Beyond that though (after all, you must be asking yourself why I rated this book four stars?!), Allende has given us an incredibly complex heroine in Eliza Sommers, who is faced with a pretty unique challenge:  Here is a woman who was raised to think and act like an upper-middle-class caucasian lady in Chile in the late 1800's, and she is suddenly, due to some unfortunate choices and decisions, a single, ethnic, immigrant girl in Gold Rush California.  This book gives the reader some fascinating peaks into several different cultures, including Chilean, Chinese, and, of course, American (whatever that it!).  I would recommend this book very highly.  Just be prepared for that disappointingly quick ending.	2002-04-09
US	43020520	R1UIJIL3XI06TV	0345444884	122553244	The Talisman	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Just OK	I've been a King fan for years, but have recently become bored with his writing style (my over-exposure to it, I think), so I thought the co-authored Talisman would be a nice change of pace.  Well, I have to tell you that at first I was not at all impressed.  In fact, I put the book down twice, for a month each time!  The first few chapters (until Jackie actually finds out about and goes to the Territories, an alternate dimension of our world) are SO overdone King.  Shades of the Shining, as Jack and his mother flee to a basically abandoned and pretty creepy hotel, shades of Hearts of Atlantis in the oceanside amusement park.  When Jack, the 12 year old hero, meets the magical older man who starts him on his journey, I was just about to throw the book out the window!!  But (here's the helpful part of the review...) read on, because from that point on is where the book gets interesting.<br />Now, plot-wise, this one is your pretty basic good-versus-evil kind of story.  Jack has to brave and surpass many tests during his quest cross-country to get the mystical Talisman that will save his mother (dying of Cancer) and the multiple dimensions of the world.  Some of the better characters like Wolf are extremely well done, add a lot of interest to the story, and offer pretty blatent commentary on the state of the environment in our world, or at least in the US. Probably the best written section of the book is smack dab in the middle, when Jack and his friend Wolf are incarcerated in Sunlight Gardener's Home for Boys.  The end is weak and underdeveloped...seems like the author's got tired of it and just wanted to finish it quickly!<br />I've never read Peter Straub before, but I would say it was pretty easy to tell King's voice from Straub's.  I imagine it is quite a challenge, for the editors as much as the authors, to get through a collaborative project such as this successfully.  All things considered, I did enjoy the story, and would say that if you like King, you willenjoy this book as well.	2002-04-09

I was hooked from page one.  <br />The author sets the tone in this tough, gritty story immediately, and that tone is pure America.  Set in the under-educated Appalachia, nature's beauty is contrasted with the harshness of life.  I'm not going to outline the story, or pull out characters for review.

It is a nice story, heart-warming and down to earth.  But once one starts to mull this story over, it becomes apparent that the story line is built on layer after layer of contrasts, ironies, and stark opposites giving the tale more depth than is immediately apparent.  Novalee is a motherless girl who, despite all odds becomes a loving mother.  She is the throwaway girl who becomes a hero.  Sister Husband is a Christian woman who hands out bible leaflets by day, and indulges with Mr. Spock at night. <BR>Set in a small town in rural Oklahoma, the community that the main character Novalee comes to know and cherish here could represent any small town, anywhere in America.  The quirky, lovable, and loving people who populate this book sometimes stretch the reader's sense of credibility, but who doesn't know a Lexie, with her wacky ideas and theories on dieting, or a Forney Hull, with his deep love of the written word?  The author does not let the caricatures get away from her; all of these people come across as real.  Wacky....but real!<BR>Finally, I loved the names in this story:  Novalee Nation, who names her daughter Americus Nation.  Wonderful!!  Forney Hull, <BR>Sister Husband (and her deceased brother, Brother Husband, who doesn't really have a role in the story, but whose name still jumps off the page!!)  Moses and Certain Whitecotton.  These are some great names.  <BR>All in all, I thought this was a very nice book.  It was an easy read; I finished it up in a matter of 4 - 5 hours.  It had a message, but it managed to give that message in a manner that was thoroughly subtle way.  I hope you enjoy it too!	2002-03-15

I think it was the first time I really understood who all of the characters were and how they are related to one another.  For example, everyone has heard of Sir Galahad...but I never realized that he was Lancelot's son!  And, really, who has ever really been able to distinguish between Morgan, Morgaine, and Morgause?  In this book, though, McKenzie really brings all of these characters to life.  She paints Guenevere as a strong, dedicated, honest woman who is dedicated to her husband and to her role as Queen.  And she manages to make this all believable without really &quot;meddling&quot; with the traditional Arthurian legend (you know, the whole Lancelot deal).  For those who love reading this genre, you will especially appreciate the way McKenzie builds into the story the &quot;factoids&quot; of day-to-day life, creating a three dimensional sense of the setting, the customs, the dress, the social mores and standards, etc., etc.  <BR>This is a very long and detailed book, and will take some time to read, so be prepared.  Personally, when it started feeling tedious (which it did, a couple of times) I set it aside for a few days and read something else.  Because  of the vivid depictions of the characters, I found that I could easily pick it up and dive right back in as if I'd just left it.  <BR>Overall, a great job.  I recommend it for anyone who has a passion for Arthurian legend.	2002-03-06

I couldn't wait to get more Sedaris, and had no doubt that I would love every word he has ever written.  WRONG.  Whoa, how wrong could I be?  It's not that it is not a good book...but, although the stories (short, and crisply written) get and hold your attention, they are completely dark and depressing.  Yes, I admit that Santaland Diaries was funny.  But I guess I'd have to compare it to how you laugh when you hit your funny bone.  You don't really want to laugh, because it really hurts, but you just can't help it...this book isn't for everyone--and I'll go with that assessment.  I found this book to be far more tragic and depressing than I expected.  Be prepared!	2002-03-06

When I picked it up, I expected to encounter more recounting of historical events within the tale, and, at first I was a little disappointed that is seemed so &quot;light&quot; on these details.  But it is a powerful story and will keep the reader enchanted in it's telling.  It reminds the reader that, in the not-too-distant past, American life was a much simpler event than today's hustle for higher education and material  possessions.  Although learning to read at the age of 98 seems an amazing feat (living UNTIL 98 without ever learning to read must have been an amazing feat as well!), it is only one of many monumental tasks that George surmounted in the course of his life.  This book does not preach, but gently suggests through the stories it depicts, that it is not the material things we accumulate that make us happy.  Rather, faith, optimism, and hard-work that make life--if not easy--interesting.  Not a difficult read, not a historical tome, but a wonderful, easy story by a fascinating man.  I recommend it!	2002-01-12

Popular images of the antebellum South depict white mansions with wide, well tended lawns and gentlemen sipping Mint Juleps, where life was rich and easy.  From the first page, this book discredits that idea, and, in it's place, gives the reader a glimpse of what was surely the more realistic life of an ordinary Southerner.  Written in a generally dark tone which suits the subject matter, the book is so detailed that I found myself smelling the hay, rain, and mud where Inman slept in hayricks, hearing the emptiness of the house while Ada struggled to deal with her emotions and situations after her father's death.  The book left me wondering how and why so many men were convinced to march to war and away from their peaceful and ordinary lives to fight a war that was in no way theirs.  But even more, it left me inspired at the character's will to overcome extraordinary obstacles.  A rich, detailed, fabulous tale!	2002-01-12

A beautiful and enthralling story that makes you believe that life does hold some important revelation for each of us.  The book paints characters who live a hard, gritty, and seemingly hopeless life, creating a fascinating and realistic portrait that catches the readers interest right away.  Ms. Morrison then weaves in a thread of fantasy so subtly that, as the plot progresses, the reader will find it hard to decide--is it real?  And, by the end of the book, you will certainly believe that, if it isn't, it certainly could be.  Finding that certain something noble and beatiful that makes you believe that your life, your parents life, your ancestor's lives, and all the events therein, were special and worthwhile, despite the hard times it took to get there, is an uplifting ideal.  Ms. Morrison makes the ideal a possibility for each of us by giving us the characters she has created in this wonderful story.  A great place to start reading Toni Morrison, I highly reccomend this book.	2001-12-24

To take all the little, disjointed comments that you run through your head, but would never say aloud to anyone, whip them into chapter/book form, and find the courage to publish them so that millions of readers can see how  absurd you are takes a rare form of courage, a strong sense of self, and great talent.  David does it with a flair.

Kings books always seem to translate very well to movies, but I have always loved the books more because of King's meticulous attention to creating a character through subtext.  His characters cannot always be conveyed on screen with the same sense of three-dimensionality that he creates in the written word.  So what a disappointment to find the shallow and lifeless characters who populate this book.  I slogged through it, always hoping that the next page I would understand who these people were, and why the did the things they did.  The plot was jointed, the tone of the story has awkward shifts and transitions.  I got the sense that this book was a hurry-it-to-the editor effort.
