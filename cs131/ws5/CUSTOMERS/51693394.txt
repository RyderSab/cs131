The language and humor are rich. It is a collection of shorter works. So far, we've just read the first story in which a little boy finds himself king and accidentally releases a fierce dragon into his kingdom. After much tribulation the boy-king figures out how to correct his mistake and return the dragon to the book from which he had escaped because of the boy-king's curiosity and disobedience.<br />\\"But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book, and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got 'The Book of Beasts.'\\"	2003-11-19

This story of a famous Japanese artist (1760-1849) is beautifully written and illustrated. It is a story of rising beyond the limitations of class, of educating oneself through persistence and hard work, and of not being confined by the narrow views of others to reach one's potential. Katsushik Hokusai influenced the work of Western Impressionists artists. This is a book not to be missed if you are studying this prolific artist.	2003-04-03

One camp would have you avoid the &quot;P&quot; word because of its negative connotations. However in his book, Practicing for Young Musicians, Dr. Snitkin states, &quot;You practice to improve technical skills and musicianship. Practicing is playing with a purpose.&quot;<br />This book is addressed to young musicians. It is written on an upper-elementary level with examples and logic that children can relate to. Specific suggestions are given to help the child use his practice time wisely and to increase his musicianship. The student realizes that it is up to him to get the most from his practice time; he is responsible for his own progress.<br />In reading this book, I kept thinking that this philosophy of being responsible for one's own progress applies in all areas, especially education. The author concluded along the same line when he wrote, &quot;What you've learned isn't limited to music. You've learned to use your time wisely... Most of all, as your own teacher, you've learned to take the responsibility for your own learning and development. In short, you've gained the satisfaction and confidence that come from a job well done.&quot; Dr. Snitkin has done his job well in motivating and educating the student to become a better musician. --Penny Gardner, author of Nine-Note Recorder Method	2000-11-26

He discovers on his fantastic adventure the importance of learning, consequences of our choices and actions, enjoying the present and all the world has to offer, and learning from one's mistakes. The vocabulary and word play are rich in this very imaginative and humorous story.<br />Here are two of my favorite quotes from the book: &quot;...Whatever we learn has a purpose and whatever we do affects everything and everyone else, if even in the tiniest way...For whenever you learn something new, the whole world becomes that much richer.&quot; And, &quot;...You had the courage to try; and what you can do is often simply a matter of what you will do.&quot;<br />This book sat on the shelf for years.

This one is the best! It makes concepts so clear by the marriage of text and illustrations. For example, I've read about Thales solving how high the Great Pyramid of Cheops was in two other books. This book used four  diagrams and several pages of text to clearly explain how Thales answered  his own question. Author Julia Diggins goes into depth on geometry but on a  level children can understand.<br />Proceed slowly, letting your children try  to solve a problem before reading about its solution. For example, pose the  problem of drawing a perfect circle using a string. Once they have solved  the problem or given up, read that part of the book. Then go to the beach  or a park and use a volleyball pole and a rope to draw circles in the sand  with your feet.<br />Then set them to figuring out how to divide a circle into  six equal parts using the string. After they solve or give up, read that  part of &quot;String, Straightedge, &amp; Shadow.&quot; Let them follow the  instructions and illustrations in chapter six to reproduce the results.  Play with a Spirograph, too.<br />Since this book is out of print, try to  locate it at a thrift store or library sale; it is worth the effort. But I  hope I find it before you.	2000-06-02

There is a whole world of history waiting for elementary-aged students in the &quot;Famous Men&quot; series. <br />Rob Shearer, the editor who put this 1904 book back into print, wonders at the common practice of focusing on  American History for years while cramming World History into one year. He  believes American History cannot be understood without a knowledge of World  History.<br />The author's original preface in 1904 states: &quot;In order to  attract and hold attention, each conspicuous feature of history...should  have an individual for its center. The child identifies himself with the  person placed before him. It is not Romulus...or Alexander that the child  has in mind when he reads, but himself, acting under the prescribed  conditions.&quot;<br />There are 31 chapters, many of them short enough to  read in one sitting. Your child will thrill with pride at Leonidas and his  1,000 brave men who stood against 2 million Persians at Thermopylae. Your  child will be enobled to read about how Pericles &quot;went among the  people, calming and cheering them, and attending faithfully to the affairs  of the government&quot; during a horrible plague that took his son, sister,  friends, and eventually himself. Your child will admire Demosthenes'  determination to overcome his problems to become a great orator.<br />Famous  Men of Greece is a valuable part of a child's education in World History.

Moreover, it denied to him a knowledge of his  inheritance from the Greek philosopher, the Roman lawgiver, the Teutonic  lover of freedom.&quot;<br />Your child will be captured by the fable of  Romulus and Remus. He or she will wonder at Cincinnatus who chose to be a  farmer rather than a dictator. And your child will admire Marcus Aurelius,  a noble emperor who lived simply, used his own money to help the poor, and  walked the streets greeting people and listening to their troubles so he  could be a better leader.<br />Older students may read Plutarch but elementary  children will gained a foundation for history by reading about &quot;Famous  Men.&quot;	2000-05-27

He gives many concrete examples of how to improve the quality of one's writing. This book is full of fun activities to encourage lively, precise writing--yet it  has none of those ghastly, contrived writing assignments.<br />Instead the  author states: &quot;A better synonym for creative writing is  'autobiography.' Those countless moments in an individual's life--brief,  intense stretches of time--stud a child's day and glitter in his mind like  diamonds long after the moments pass. By recalling those moments of  experience through sensory language--specific, exact, sharply drawn--the  young writer can practice the vital skills of writing. ...you should mine  the riches of experiences in every child's world, riches for the pen or  pencil to transform into record.&quot;<br />My children refer to the lists of  tips I copied from &quot;Any Child Can Write&quot; as they write about  their experiences, or a book they read, or a painting they studied. The  lists help them write a description of a place or person or event. They  also use more descriptive vocabulary as they write about a photo to place  in their scrapbook.

After comparing it to another version, I can say that it is a more complete collection, the fables are more fully developed with rich language, and the beautiful illustrations  set it above the rest.<br />My nine-year-old son retold one of the fables we  read from this book: &quot;Once a dove saw an ant fall into a river. The  ant was struggling for safety. So the dove took a piece of hay and swooped  down and dropped the hay right by the ant so it could float to  safety.<br />&quot;Then a different day, the ant saw the same dove that saved  the ant's life. A man was getting ready to throw a stone at the dove to  kill it. Then the ant went up to his heel and stung the man. It made the  man miss his aim. So the dove flew away.&quot;<br />For those of you who like  to have your child retell or narrate a story he has heard, this book earns  my top recommendation for a starting point. The stories are short enough to  narrate easily and rich enough in language and content to inspire a good  retelling by the child.	2000-02-03

Carolina takes her precious china doll, like the one that has been passed  down in my own family for generations. Carolina ends up sacrificing her  doll for the good of her family and others.<br />Elizabeth Yates' stories are  well-written, are sensitive to the feelings of children, have strong family  values, and are gently faith-promoting.	2000-01-11
