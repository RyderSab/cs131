There aren't alot of filler chapters that read like an advertisement and that you can sometimes find in self-help books that endlessly go on and on about things \\"you can do\\" if you use the techniques within. The first two chapters consist of an explanation of the system and the research she did to develop it. She references the Lazanov Superlearning method and a few others that you also might want to check out. <br /> <br />I was actually quite satisfied with the book, I've got alot of these types of self-help books but this is one of my favorites because it deals almost completely with technique and application. <br /> <br />This is a good find. Enjoy.	2005-10-02

As other reviewers have already pointed out the author makes a vain attempt to reduce the siddhis to nothing more than shifts in our everyday perception; no more than cryptic word games. The Author's conclusions are utterly ludicrous and are reached through no reasonable amount of logic whatsoever. He tries to explain away and pronounce dead wrong things that 2500 years of Indian scholars and Yogic Ascetics know to be fact. This is by far and away the most ignorant, westernized interpretation of any area of Yoga I have ever seen. I wouldn't be speaking so harshly if it weren't entirely warranted. Trust me. If you want to learn about The Eight-Fold Path and the Siddhis I highly suggest you look elsewhere.	2004-01-02

I've been reading hard SF since I was eight so it was with great expectation that I finally got around to reading Stranger in a Strange Land, a book said by many to be the flagship for the old school SF Genre in the same way that Lord of the Rings is the flagship for Fantasy. Well I was unpresently surprised to find out that this novel was anything but worthy of representing Science Fiction.<br />1. The writing is not even close to Heinlein's best. About 99% of the dialouge in the book is what can only be described as \\"Banter\\"(you'll know exactly what I mean if you read it), which isn't all that bad at first especially since it usually consists of the same 60 year-old guy telling his bikini-wearing secretaries to hurry up and cook for him or they'll get spanked, with their only response being something along the lines of \\"Oh Boss!\\" and then hurrying away in that jiggly fashion so common among young sparsely dressed girls. The only problem is that reading 400+ pages of this will make even the most stalwart and proud to be Male, Man puke all over himself.(Trust me, I know) Which brings me to my next point...<br />2. The debase subservant manner in which women are treated in this book is really digusting. Trust me when I say that I wouldn't be mentioning this if it wasn't taken to a ridiculous level because I proclaim to be one of those types of Males I mentioned above that agree's with a women's submission to a man. But to be honeset, as strong willed as I am about all women bowing down to me this book really made me question on weather or not I should rethink my opinions. If I sound like as much of an ... as Jubal Harshaw does then I've just done a 180 and joined the feminist movement. It's really really heavy-handed to the point of irritation.<br />3. The story itself is just one cliche' after another with a bunch of \\"beat you over the head\\" obvious metaphors and the ending of course anyone could see coming a mile away. The fact that this is a science fiction novel(it's widely known that of all genre's, science fiction literature becomes \\"dated\\" the quickest and easiest) and was written in 1961 is no excuse, there is plenty of SF out there that hasn't fallen prey to the trap of time.<br />It was only a 3-day read but I if I had to do it over a again I would instead spend my time re-reading SF that actually is good. Such as Ender's Game by Card which if it's not certainly deserves to be the SF Flagship as it's one of the best books ever written.<br />If you're looking for a good Heinlein try Door into Summer. If you're looking for a good novel of someone going from the dirt to deity in a spritual sense there are several other novels you would be much better off reading. ...	2003-03-14

This is the 1st Riverworld book and probably the best at least in terms of originality.  The Idea is that everyone who ever lived is resurrected on a planet with a huge river.<br />Pretty simple, the main character is Sir Richard Francis Burton (a real life explorer who spent much of his life searching for the nile) and he forms and leads a party that includes a Neanderthal, an alien, and Alice from Alice in Wonderland.  The rest of the book is spent with them journeying towards the headwaters of the river to try and find out the mystery of how their situation (i.e. being resurrected on the vast river planet) came to be.<br />As already said this is most likely the best book in the series.  The idea is fresh and the character of Burton who was a real person is a good one to have lead an adventure.  The story is also fleshed out well with the assistance of the interesting supporting cast.  I especially liked the inclusion of Alice.<br />The major enemy in this book is Hermann Goring another person of historical fame, who provides the readers with an exceptionally good and real antagonist for Burton, who is a very well done hero.<br />Despite the questionability of the later books(I've written reviews on them as well) this one is exceptionally well done.	2002-06-27

The plot is that of the two Riverboats continuing their journeys up river and finally meeting and have a huge battle.<br />There are a lot of boring parts to this book.  Especially in the beginning where there are two many dream sequences.  So you may be skipping a bit in the beginning.  After about the middle though, things get quite a bit more interesting and towards the end they are extremely exciting.<br />As stated before the discrepancies in this novel and the next one are enormous.  The author leaves quite a few issues unanswered.  Such as the fate of Kazz, Loghu, Tom Mix, Jack London, and Johnston, the crow killer.<br />One of the things I found most irritating about this book was that it seemed like the author had plenty of time to put in boring dream sequences but no time to clear up said issues for the sake of storyline completeness.  Characters were literally there one chapter and gone the next.  Without any written reference to them or why they were no longer in the main travelling party.<br />Still worth it for the great Riverboat battle at the end, but it's irritating how many main characters are killed off wantonly.<br />I gave this book 3 stars because once you get to the Riverboat Battle between Clemens and Prince John it's all exceptionally good with lots of action centering around your favorite characters.	2002-06-27

She is an ex-dirigible pilot.  The main plot of this story is that after Clemens leaves the town where the metal ore is, (there is still some left after he built his boat.) the people left there decide to build a Dirigible to get to the headwaters of the river which would be much faster.<br />As noted by other reviewers this novel is the first time the Author doesn't stay focused on one person the whole time.  Even though Jill is for the most part the main character towards the middle and end the book skips to the viewpoint of others, this in itself isn't bad.  After awhile the story becomes split up pretty evenly between Jill, Burton, and Clemens.  This is nice because Jill is especially irritating with her whiny feminism that could only be an enjoyable read to a like-minded feminist.  But it's nice to see Burton again and it's interesting to see how Clemens is doing.<br />The plot itself is pretty boring.  The Author states in the preface that \\"The Dark Design\\" and the following book \\"The Magic Labyrinth\\" were meant to be one book, but it was too long so he split it up into two.  Well it shows because \\"The Dark Design\\" is where everything interesting is being set up to happen, or waiting to happen and \\"The Magic Labyrinth\\" is where everything interesting finally happens.  <br />Another folly of \\"The Dark Design\\" is that as stated in many other reviews there start to appear some discrepancies in the story line.  The example of the height of the cliffs in the valleys has been used.  The author accounts for the change as a matter of false perception on the part of people.  Of course these little slips aren't anything compared to the ridiculous ones in the next two books.<br />Yet ANOTHER problem with \\"The Dark Design\\" is that by the end of the book it seems quite probable that characters that previously had a definite origin had there pasts changedat that last minute so they could be used in different parts of the story.  A good example of this is Firebrass it simply did not seem likely to me about the secret he had.  There was definitely no evidence of this in the previous book where he first appears, \\"The Fabulous Riverboat.&quot;<br />I gave this book two stars because it is at least one step up from utter drivel, but the truth is it's not a very large step and you may find your self skipping alot of pages to get to the end so that you can read the next book.	2002-06-27

This is the 2nd book in the riverworld series and the main character is Samuel Clemens otherwise known as the famous writer Mark Twain.  He and his party decide to seek metal ore so that they can build a Riverboat and travel to the headwaters of the river.  Most of the Story is spent in Sam getting the Riverboat built and the wars that are caused by the scarcity of the metal ore.<br />The main character of Clemens is quite a bit different in comparison with Burton from the first novel.  And when you first start this novel you will be longing for the original party from \\"To your scattered bodies go.\\"  Clemens is a lot weaker in body and spirit than Burton.  He is in fact the opposite when it comes to physical fitness and leadership.  Nevertheless he is always in charge.  The real fun of this novel over the previous is Clemens's sidekick named Joe Miller who is a Titanthrop or real life giant weighing over 800 lbs. and standing 9 feet tall.<br />The major enemy in this book is Prince John of England.<br />This book isn't better than the previous one because the story isn't as good the basic idea of the river world isn't as original and the characters aren't as fun.  But this novel is a very close second to the previous one and it also explores alot things that the previous one did not have a chance to.  For example life on the riverworld is now just getting to it's full thriving point.  People are settling in and forming real states and countries along the river, the wars for the metal ore are also worth mentioning as their detail and excitement keep the reading turning the pages.<br />A good 2nd to the series.	2002-06-27

This is the 5th book in the Riverworld series.<br />The main character is now only Burton, although the story does focus on other characters in his party for brief amounts of time.<br />The main plot here is having reached the tower and solved its mystery the party must now solve the mystery of a Renegade in control of the tower.  The story centers on this and also the pleasures they take by using the almost god-like power of the computer in the tower.<br />This is a pretty good novel but the boring sequences from the last one are here in spades and now come in the form of intricate backgrounds of each of the characters.  Also there is a strange weirdness you may feel while reading this because of the fact that the whole book 326 pages takes place in the tower in a relatively short period of time.  This is where many other reviewers got the notion that the Author just threw this book in to make some cash.<br />Still it's exciting to follow Burton around without the hindrances of a huge amount of people and one thing I can say about this novel and the one previous is that towards the very end there is a point where everything is explained.  It's kind the equivalent of the bad guy in Scooby Doo removing his mask and explaining why he \\"could have pulled it of if it weren't for those darn kids.\\"  And these points are very exciting and make you sit up and pay attention since basically this is exactly what you've been waiting to find out for 5 books.<br />Note:  There is one very specific discrepancy I would like to point out.  It's around page 28, and it's where the party is talking about living together because of the Renegade, Turpin asks Frigate if he's ever been in the slammer and Frigate replies only in his own personal one.  THEN Burton thinks to himself that Frigates statement wasn't true because Frigate had been a prisoner several time including under Hermann Goring(this took place in To Your Scattered Bodies Go, and Burton was there also).....Well this is very strange because it was later revealed (in The Dark Design) that the Frigate that was in Goring's prison with Burton was not the same Frigate as the one in the tower currently! And Burton Knew this!  So he should not have thought. Anyone that has read this far will know the story behind the two Frigates I don't want to reveal too much.  But that's a pretty bid mistake.<br />----In regards to the other reviews of this series that I've written, I'd like to say a few words concerning the series as a whole...<br />Well over all I'd say this is a pretty good series.  I could have used some editing in some places and some more info in others.  But I have to say the feeling I had when I finished the last couple lines of the last book was a good one.  I wanted there to be more after 5 books I was surprised and saddened that it ended.  So unless you have nothing better to do go ahead read through this and skip over the stuff that is boring because believe me you won't be missing anything.  Otherwise if your really bored you can just read every word of it, that's what I did the first two times I read the series.	2002-06-27

The Blackadder series is by far and away one of the best if not THE best British comedy's of all time.  That is why it's so unfortunate that there is little to no good written material or satisfacory guides to it.<br />Out of the two this books available about the Blackadder series this one is by far the worst.<br />The authors seem to know exactly what to do wrong and stick to that formula throughout the book.  They discuss people and shows surrounding the series but one cannot help but feel that there is too little of a connection to the Blackadder series.  They give NO information about the production of the shows as some great guides like Zicree's Twilight Zone Companion does.<br />The most irritating part of this book is the authors' gall and audacity to re-write the jokes in the episodes.  Each episode section has a bolded sub heading where basically the authors, in telling something about the episode, re-tell some of the jokes that were in that particular episode.  It gets really irritating really quickly especially since the jokes are much better when watching the actual show and they are only [messed] up by having to read the changed versions in the book....<br />Suffice it to say this book isn't very good at all, and I would advise very much against purchasing it.	2002-06-24

It's put together perfectly to compliment the show and it's many facets.  It covers everything about the show in a clear consice pattern.<br />Each episode section begins with <br />-A screenshot of the episode <BR>-A full cast listing<BR>-Serlings verbal introduction<BR>-An overview of what happens in the episode<BR>-Serlings verbal exit<BR>-Discussion, quotes, and interviews regarding that particular episodes production.<br />There is also a large amount of biographical information on several of the shows' writers, directors, and cast such as Rod Serling and Richard Matheson.<br />At the begining and end of each season there is even more production information regarding how the show did for the season, ratings and pretty much anyhing you would want to know about the show and what surrouds it.<br />Additionally Zicree does an exceptional job of interviewing and quoting important people that were working on the show.<br />This is a wonderful book for fans of the series that explains and expounds alot on the genius that was Rod Serling.<br />A MUST BUY!	2002-06-24

I actually expected something a bit better from the author of the great Sandman comic series, but maybe he's just not good a novels.<br />The story is about another world that lies below London (aptly titled \\"London Below\\").  The world is filled with your basic strange creatures and intelligent rats.  Nothing really to see here and really nothing at all thats new.  The characters try to be interesting but they fall short since the general plot and subsequently the characters also have been done so many times.  The whole \\"outsider unwittingly saves the day\\" thing has been done [over and over] by authors alot better than this one.<br />I gave it two stars (instead of one) because if you're just starting to read fiction for first time in your life and you pick up this book, you will probably enjoy it.  Unfortuantly 90's authors especially Science Fiction and Fantasy writers are usually just rehashing stuff already done better by the old time greats.<br />So, the verdict is, get this if you've got no culture and a plane ride ... past that don't expect much.<br />If nothing else I suggest you start with pre 70's fantasy and sf...	2002-05-13

There are alot of different kinds of stories out there and alot of different reasons why these stories are or are not good.  There are some stories where it is absolutly neccessary for the reader to identify strongly with the main character to enjoy the book.  Alot of times this isn't important with books with lots of action and adventure but with a story that is more based on drama it is important otherwise the drama is not there.<br />Jumper is a storey like this.  Regardless of the Sci Fi premise and subject matter.  This storey is about a young boy that runs away from his father because his father is a abusive alchoholic.  The &quot;Jumping&quot; part of the storey is used alot and is a large part of the storey objectively but isn't really an important part of the storey....<br />There are at least two distinct ways a storey about someone with a power like this could be handled.  1:  the main character could explore the adventures of jumping and 2:  He could use the power to suplement his lifestyle.<br />Now remembering the novel I don't recall the main character ever Jumping for fun or for the adventure of it.  Mostly he does it to get away from people who are trying to hurt him, to help people he cares about, and to revenge himself on people that have hurt him or people he cares about.<br />The Jumping is never seriously explored.  Everything is done with a kind of matter of factness, meaning that Jumping is never really the main theme of the book.  Regardless of the fact that the government is chasing him for his power. Those sections are more about his getting away from the government and getting his girlfriend back.  But even this isn't treated with an &quot;action-packed&quot; sign.<br />All this may make this book sound boring and if you pick it up or think of buying because you want to read a good book on &quot;teleportation&quot; than you may just be disappointed.  What I like about this book in regards to the teleportation is that is probably exactly what a normal 20th century adolescent would do with such a power.  It was very realistic.  I also like that it IS a drama about I kids life and problems he has and that teleportation is on the back burner.  Don't get me wrong he teleports alot and the subject is addressed alot but not in the way of what it is, but more in the way of &quot;well the stupid NSA is chasing me for it and I just want to be left alone.&quot;  You get idea he would teleport alot less if he didn't have to.<br />Anyway don't buy this book unless your interested in a real life drama about a normal person with normal problems that has this power and uses this power to try and solve some of his problems.<br />Overall keeping the previous paragraph in mind I think this was an excellent book.  But don't buy it JUST for Teleportation.	2001-07-06

This science which is most often referred to as Laya yoga, although Laya Yoga is not really recognized as a form of yoga in the sense that it combines information taken from Hatha and Tantric texts.  This presents a problem for anyone wishing to focus their yogic studies on Kundalini and the Chakras because Hatha Yoga and Tantra Yoga or very large schools of yoga and also somewhat different.  This book is the best answer to that problem that has been published to date.  Although as you may have read in other reviews it is very dry and dense, you also sometime get the feeling of disorganization but this is only because the material is so relentlessly complete. Although the first time you read this book you may not get alot out of it, it is invaluable as a resource tool for the study of Layayoga there simply isn't enough good information out there that is presented in the &quot;old ways&quot; or eastern yogi's.  <br />Bottom line if your interested in this line study this book is a must buy.	2001-03-27

Once again Sleator dazzles and rivites us with his incredible knowdledge of that which is deeply scientific.  Here we have a book about dimensional travel, but not in the Time sense(Time sometimes considered the fourth dimension-this is of course is ridiculous for many reasons, 1 of which is simply considering that the 1st 3 dimensions have everything in common and nothing in common with time.)But in the sense that there are more angles out there.<br />I cannot even come close to explaining how amazing and in depth this book is.  It will stretch the boundries of your imagination.<br />It may be a little hard to understand because the ideas expressed with are as always Ingenious.  But simply pay close attention during the explanation and illustration using the piece of notebook paper and you should be fine.  The way it's put together and the way Sleator uses his characters to explain things that the laymen may not get for lack of Theoretical Physics knowledge is perfect!  The cool part about the way he presents it is that after you read the book you will want to go out and find out if it's true or at least where he got his info. (Speaking of which if William Sleator or anyone who knows reads this please send me an email about where the Author finds this info.  Thanks.)<br />This book is among the many other Sleator books that are unforgettable and mind expanding.  I also reccomend Singularity, Intersteller Pig, Strange Attractors, The Duplicate, Others See Us, and House of Stairs.<br />Truly you will have open eyes after reading this book.	2001-02-03
US	49049378	R309HQ7QOCZKJJ	0140375147	648355835	Others See Us	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Amazing!	&quot;Oh wad some power the giftie gie us.   To see ourselves as other see us!&quot;<br />Possibly one of the last Great Sleator Books, &quot;Other See Us&quot; takes us for a journey into the minds of others.  This is an amazing story of seeing how other people see things and who and what they are inside.  <br />Once again Great 1st person use.  Sleator draws you into the story until you realize you are the story.  You empathize so much with the character that this could easily be happening to you.  This in my opinion is one of Sleator's greatest skills, to make his characters utterly realistic.  Never before have I experienced real people in circumstances like these.  It's Awsome.<br />A final not I sometimes forget to add to my Sleator reviews.  Do not be fooled into thinking his books are JUST for young people.   I've read ideas and concepts in his booksthat I  wouldn't see in any Koontz or King <br />Anyway add this to your list of must have Sleators.	2001-02-03
US	49049378	R1OASKBHFSOWQ8	0141304316	286278011	The Duplicate (Novel)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Horrifying!	God this book is so good!<br />One of my more obscure personal favorites of Sleators, &quot;The Duplicate&quot; is that much more scary because of how realistic Sleator writes the book.  Aside from the Spee-Dee-Dupe(and even that could be real), everything this in this book makes you believe that this is happening.  And even happening to you.  I love, I mean I LOVE Sleator's use of 1st Person NEVER have I ever seen the 1st person point of view done better by any other author.  <br />This Author is simply AMAZING!<br />Please for your own sake, get this book and read it.  If you don't have the money go to library.  Expand your mind a little.<br />I almost cried as I got so drawn into the emtional trials that the characters have to go through.  These are real people.<br />DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK!	2001-02-03
US	49049378	R1X7HBKDUI014L	0140375953	540973685	Interstellar Pig	Books	5	10	12	N	N	A Great Adventure!	Probably the most renowned Sleator book &quot;Intersteller Pig&quot; really does deliver as much as it suggests and much more.  Although sometimes other of Sleators works seem more serious.  I quickly change my mind after re-reading it.  (I have all of his stuff several times, especially his earlier stuff which now is getting up into teen amounts of time I've read them.)  The idea may at first seem less serious BUT as always Sleator's delivery is hardcore and realistic.  This is how a real person would react under these circumstances.<br />There are some really great scenes in this book.  All the gibberish language the piggy uses.  When Zena, Manny, and Joe all have something to offer Barney.<br />I can't get over the AWSOME IMAGERY.  When Zena is trying to sell something to Barney and Joe walks in from the Rain dripping wet from head to toe and knowing full well what they were up to.  It's just amazing.  AND THE BATTLES, THE BATTLES ARE GREAT!  YOUR ARE THERE.  And the COOL Names Sleator gives different items talk about an imaginative vocabulary.  &quot;Portable Access to the Fifth Dimensional Matrix&quot;  There are a couple others I can't remember of hand.  After reading the book 12 times I have to wait awhile before gorging myself on it again.<br />And then there is THE GAME.  Before it everything else is paled.  I could never explain it to you without you having read the book.  But suffice it to say I remember being a kid and staying up all night with my best friend making up cards and a board for Intersteller Pig.  We never finished it but man did we have fun.<br />Please do not miss this book, young child or old adult it doesn't matter, you will love the things that it does with your imagination.<br />Enjoy	2001-02-03

I am so mad at those other reviewers that are bringing Sleator's star average down with their moronic reviews.  Hey you guys: &quot;THIS IS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL OK, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SCIENCE FICTION.  THIS IS FROM HIS LIFE.&quot;<br />I can't believe people don't appreciate the first only look we have into the life of the Literary God known as William Sleator.  <br />Utterly Hilarious I laughed so hard when I read the Hypnotysm chapter.  And its not bad at all that the chapter skip around and the characters are different ages because for one it just doesn't negativly effect the book and B: these are real people.  It was so cool to learn about Tycho Sleator, the Authors brother and a Physicist today.<br />If you are a true Sleator fan, then you will love this look into the amazing background of this man.<br />Please enjoy!	2001-02-03
US	49049378	R3IBVATPRPZK2N	0140345817	92096424	The Green Futures of Tycho	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Epic!	Sleator is unquestionalby a master at this juncture.  And &quot;Green Futures&quot; only serves to reiterate this point.  One of his more dry storys &quot;Green Futures&quot; utterly destroys any sense of what you think is possible and impossible and aslo what is bad and what is good.<br />One of the most chilling aspects about alot of Sleator's books is his sometimes horrific display of the Nuclear Family.  This book and other like &quot;Rewind&quot; open a few doors into some frightening house holds.<br />The bottom line is that Sleator is and will continue to be simply Awsome.  I highly reccomend this, and many other or his older works like, House of Stairs, Intersteller Pig, Singularity, Strange Attractors, The Duplicate, and Others See Us.<br />I've been gorging myself on Sleator novels since early childhood, and will continue to do so.  The only complaint that I have about this author is that he is not more recognized for people to see his greatness.  Truly this man and his works are a credit to our civilization.	2001-02-03
US	49049378	R1WYV0X9JN71GU	0671745077	864816767	Monster	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Terrifying!	This book really deserves 5 stars.  All the young adult fiction that everyone thinks is garbage should really be given a second look when it comes to Author's like Christopher Pike.  This book is everything I'd hoped it would be and more.<br />I've read a few others and I just can't believe how much I underestimated this Author.  With his skill in plot and story I also can't believe why guys like Koontz are famous and Pike isn't as famous.  <br />What a ridiculous society we live that so obsesed with junk.<br />Buy this book, read it, love it.  You will be introduced into the world of Christopher Pike and he will take you on many many more adventures after this one.<br />Have fun!	2001-02-03
US	49049378	R1HUW35JFQDKBL	0140375988	116715627	Singularity	Books	5	5	10	N	N	Emotional!	The first thing I would like to say is that don't listen to those other reviewers.  I cannot ever in my wildest imaginations understand why people would think Sleator's writing especially his good stuff like this one is &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;not realistic&quot;.  These people don't know what they are talking about.  Because 1st the Theoretical Physics in all of his books are well published and reputed theories and facts.  And 2nd he is just an amazing author.<br />As for this book...I cannot explain how important it is that you read this book.  &quot;Singularity&quot; is one of the first I read and to this day one of if not the Best of all of Sleators works.  You really feel what Harry is going through with his brother and his motivations.  When Harry goes through his schedule you are there with him and, it's amazing, it made me want to go improve myself like that the change that takes place is so great.  If you don't read anything else by this author then read this book.  It WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.<br />I cried when towards the end.<br />Enjoy this book.	2001-02-03
US	49049378	R145XLKZ47CA1B	0140345809	736001477	House of Stairs	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Utterly Horrifying!!!	Possibly more than any other of Sleator's Books this one carries a very serious note with it.  A note that after reading the final sentence in this book you find Completely Terrifying.<br />This books something that they should require in schools instead of Junk like Lord of the Flies they should give children a serious look into the human psyche.  What motivates us, what makes us who we are, and what makes us what we we will become and forever be.<br />Once again sleator adresses scientific questions that have very scary answers.  This book is always in a locked contest for favorite book, battling with my other favorite Sleator works that I think are #1, Intersteller Pig, Strange Attractors, and Singularity.  DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK.  IT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE AND YOURSELF.<br />This is Pure Genius.  Please Please Please read this.	2001-02-03
