These maps are compiled by the Nevada Dept. of Transportation and show the status of dirt roads to a far more refined degree than the Delorme atlas, which doesn't distinguish good roads from bad. The maps in this atlas cover 30' of latitude and longitude at a scale of 1\\" = 4 miles. The map are blank and white and show only roads, water features and land boundaries. When exploring in the Nevada outback, I would carry both atlases.	2005-08-18

The book does not provide the cave locations, however, but presumably they are shown on the referenced topo map.  Also have some general sections on cave geology.	2004-11-19

It appears at first to be a rather dry history of a New England church, like many others, and the first few chapters nearly lose the reader in distant church history.  But wait, this isn't just any church; it's Alice's church.  You know, from the song \\"Alice's Restaurant.\\"  Cut to the 1960s, and you have a fascinating story of the intersection of hippies, media, folk music, idealism and the brutal demands of real life. At the serene center of it all is Arlo, who had the naivete, charm and good fortune to dump trash where he shouldn't have and write a quirky song to tell the world about it.  What happens when an obscure 18-minute song becomes a hit becomes a cultural phenomenon becomes a movie? Things implode, that's what.  Relationships disintegrate as the very act of recording destroys the thing being recorded (like particle physics). Author Lee is clearly a church supporter, but she is also a fine reporter who has the sense to let the story tell itself. Just when things get a little too sentimental or weird, Lee brings it back to center. Only in the last few pages does she gush uncontrolably (or lets the quotes do so).  In the end, the early history of the church makes sense in the light of its afterlife. At least as portrayed in the book, the whole thing fits into a grand gestalt. Alice's Church is now the Guthrie Center, supposedly named for Woody but really an extension of Arlo. It is devoted to charitable works that are vaguely defined and seem in danger of disgressing into Sixties-like anarchy. Only the charismatic force of Arlo seems to hold it all together.	2004-10-10

About half of the book is a road atlas of the region and the other half is a summary of each of the towns and tourist spots, with color photos of each of them.  I would have liked a lot more detail on each town (There is no more than a paragraph for each.), but this book at least gave me enough information to decide where to go.  This is a large-format paperback (about 9 x 12 inches) produced by the Automobile Association.	2002-12-15

It shows the major river systems throughout the state and the significant tributaries within them. Although it was probably intended for environmental study, it could be very useful to canoeist and kayakers.  A rating system describes the smoothness and scenic attractiveness of many navigable rivers, as well as showing the locations of dams.	2002-10-11

This book is less about his Federalist policies than about his psychological makeup and personal scandals. It doesn't go into much detail about his government career or economic theories, but it is easy to read and provides plenty of entertainment.  It turns out, Hamilton and Burr were made for each other.	2002-10-10

This is a very large paperback that includes both the full script from the movie and a scrapbook of scenes and excerpts. I laughed as hard reading the script as I did at the movie itself -- in part because I now understood what they were saying! Brian was the best Python movie -- the only one with a complete story, and fine mistreatment of Christianity. This book is a great way to remember it.<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: Don't confuse this large-format trade paperback (isbn 0448165686, 11x14\\") with the small mass-market paperback (no isbn, 4x7\\") with the same title which contains only the script (no scrapbook).	2002-10-05

In reality, the coast is a pretty dull, straight-line affair, pounded by surf that makes it difficult to paddle too close to shore.  (I prefer the craggy coastlines of New England or the Pacific Northwest.) The tours in this book explore some of the few protected bays and some places on the open ocean where you can get in and out of the surf safely.  It is probably the best book on the region, but don't make a special trip here on account of it.	2002-09-18

I have serious doubts as to whether any of the author's exploits described in this \\"non-fiction\\" book actually took place -- but that's the fun! On a long drive, I listened to the abridged audiotape version of this book, without knowing anything about it. I was enthralled -- in part because I couldn't figure out whether it was supposed to be fiction or non-fiction. Real people and world events are weaved into the story in such a way that it could have happened, yet the author's claimed exploits are way too heroic to be believed. The fact that I didn't know whether it was real gave the book an intriguing edge, at least for the first half. Aren't all good spy books about deception and misdirection? By the end, however, I was getting queasy, mainly from the described violence, which I was now convinced was totally in the author's head. In all, this was an interesting read, if only to try to figure out the flaws in the story.	2002-09-06

There's more towns dead than alive out there! Modern cities and highways are shown<br />in black ink, and the ghost towns and historic places in red, complete with anecdotes<br />documenting their significance and the years they existed.

Two thirds of the book is a study of the huge guns constructed in France during WWI. The remainder is a discussion of Bull's own HARP program in the early 1960s.  The first part is accompanied by B+W photos, while the latter has color photos of the modern equipment &amp; testing.  There are also lots of graphs and technical formulae.  Probably an important reference for anyone studying this technology.	2001-10-12

It consists exclusively of milepost lists for all significant roads and trails on the island.  The B+W photos are not too pretty, and the book does not provide any of the usual tourist info on hotels, food and travel, but it contains an exceptional density of data for hikers and auto explorers.  I would use it as a supplement to some other mainstream tourist guide.	2001-09-15

Treatments proposed include &quot;detoxifying baths&quot;, healing message, intestinal cleaning, &quot;thumping the thymus&quot; (ie beating ones chest like Tarzan) and &quot;sunshine on the genitals.&quot; Includes dozens of recipes for &quot;supernutition.&quot; No doubt just about everything suggested is medically ineffective. The book is mainly of interest for its unintended humor and for its place in the social history of AIDS. Includes silly B+W photos.	2001-09-09

This one comes from official State of New Mexico maps, so it contains information on the status of dirt roads that Delorme doesn't have (since Delorme comes from USGS sources).  If you do a lot of dirt road exploring, this atlas could be very helpful.  Outside of big towns, this atlas even shows individual houses and windmills.	2000-12-31
