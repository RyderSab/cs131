Delightful story about an infamous Earl (Thomas) who's good luck is legendary and a young lady who tries his patience at every turn (Fia) - and makes him doubt that his legendary good luck is holding!<br />Thomas is on a secret mission to Scotland where he was to steal a &quot;letter&quot; that could cause/prevent a war from the Laird (DUncan).  As it's a &quot;secret&quot; mission, he has to steal into Duncan's home to search for the letter and that's when he falls  for Fia - literally - or rather Fia pushes him out of the window.  Entirely by accident of course!  Fia is Duncan's ward and is also on a mission - of a personal nature - she's determined to be a London playwright...<br />And she's a kind soul who collects old/stray animals in need of TLC - the author did an excellent job of giving personalities to these woebegone animals.  Their many abuses to Thomas' good nature will have you smiling!<br />I found one of the secondary characters, Robert, quiet interesting - there's definitely anoter story there!  Robert is a reknowned coward (throughout Scotland), a dandy - and once very briefly impersonated a regal &quot;lady.&quot;<br />ONE LUCKY LORD is a Keeper!	2001-01-06

She was attracted to him but frightened  if he came too close.<br />I did not finish the book because it simply  didn't hold my interest.  I'm rating it a so-so read because I really hate  giving negative reviews.  This authors other books could be perfectly  wonderful =)	2000-08-01
