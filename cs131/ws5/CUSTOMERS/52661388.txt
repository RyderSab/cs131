And judging by the contents of this book, she has a right to be. She is angry at the damage and destruction being wrought on individuals and societies in the name of moral relativism. And a major source of this tsunami of immorality and amorality, according to Bruce, comes from the radical Left.<br /><br />What makes this book unique, however, is that it is not just the usual suspects making the charges of moral decay. The author is no right-wing religious maniac. She is instead a liberal, secular feminist and lesbian who is pro-choice. And she had been a card-carrying member of the radical Left for many years, before defecting to a more sensible and sober position.<br /><br />Her book contains a chilling look at the way radical secularist and leftist values have driven out other values, and have left a trail of destruction in their wake. She looks at how a small group of people who are intent on imposing their destructive agenda on the rest of society are succeeding at a rapid pace.<br /><br />The real enemy here is the pernicious notion of moral relativism, the notion that at heart there are absolutely no rights and no wrongs, and the only real wrong is if someone suggests there are rights and wrongs. Says Bruce, the radical Left does not want to push the boundaries of right and wrong, but wants to get rid of those boundaries altogether.<br /><br />The pathological narcissism of the loony left harms everyone, as individual traumas and disorders are foisted upon the rest of society. \\"The Left is led by a cadre of damaged and powerful individuals,\\" says Bruce, \\"who have been condemned by their own politics never to escape their victimhood\\".<br /><br />With her insider's perspective, she documents how feminists, radical black activists, homosexual advocates and other Leftist organizations are intent on destroying personal responsibility, morality and decency in the name of self-gratification and nihilism.<br /><br />Now these may seem like just so many fightin' words. But she provides detailed, documented examples of this destruction. She offers one gruesome example after another of how this is taking place.<br /><br />The Left's attack on Christianity is a major case in point, argues Bruce. That is because the church is the main bulwark of moral certitude, something the moral relativists just cannot stand. Even though the author is not a believer, she can see clearly the concentrated attack on faith which the Left is engaged in.<br /><br />This can take the form of so-called works of art like \\"Piss Christ\\" which denigrate the faith, or legislation passed to silence believers from expressing their faith in public. It can mean Political Correctness running amuck, with the banning of Christmas carols or passing hate-crime legislation which silences Christian preachers.<br /><br />There are other targets in the sights of Bruce. Activist judges and an amoral court system that allow rapists and murderers to virtually walk away scot-free is another topic she highlights. Also, the radical push by homosexual lobbyists to force their lifestyle on the rest of society is also hammered by Bruce.<br /><br />This is all the more incredible because she herself is a practicing lesbian. But she is not afraid to call a spade a spade, and denounce homosexual activists who are quite happy to target our children.<br /><br />Indeed, this is what really gets Bruce angry: the way children are especially being targeted by the radicals on the Left. This comes in many forms. Explicit sex education for the youngest of children is one example. The attack on the Boy Scouts for not taking homosexual scout masters is another. So too is the push to normalize child-adult sex, with many respected academics and others championing the cause.<br /><br />In much of this push to value-neutral activity there is first a push to value-neutral language. That is, verbal engineering precedes social engineering. Thus radicals pushing pedophilia speak of \\"intergenerational sex\\" instead, as if the evil of child sexual abuse is mitigated by name-changing.<br /><br />Bruce believes the attempt to sexualize our children is one of the greatest evils that the radical Left is involved in. She examines in detail how the sex education industry and many academics are waging war on our children. The examples she provides will - or should - make your blood boil. It did mine. And it certainly has her blood pressure up.<br /><br />Of course all this moral indignation will make no sense to the moral relativists. If there is no right and wrong, then there is nothing to get upset about. If everything is permissible, then how can anyone get angry and make moral judgments or condemnation?<br /><br />And that is exactly why Bruce is right to target the moral relativists. They not only seek to justify every evil action, but strip from us the very ability to say `No, this is wrong'. They talk about freedom and tolerance, but what they really want is the freedom to do whatever they want and for the rest of us to just tolerate it.<br />But this can never be. As long as there is real evil in the world, there will be moral disgust against it.<br /><br />Bruce documents a lot of this evil in gory detail. And she is angry in the process. But if it gets us angry and motivates us to stand up for what is right, then that anger has served a good purpose. It seems that a world that has lost its moral radar needs a lot more of this kind of anger. May it long continue.hanging.

But given that half of all abortion victims are male, this seems like an odd demand. But if one still insists on a women-only discussion, this book at least will qualify.<br /><br />This book features twelve women who all think that abortion is far from being pro-women. Instead, they all believe that abortion is basically anti-women, and that it is time women rethink the past three decades of pro-abortion propaganda on the issue.<br /><br />And they are well qualified to speak on the host of issues associated with the abortion debate. The authors are lawyers, doctors, academics, political scientists and ethicists, all experts in their fields. And all are convinced that women have been sold short by the pro-abortion camp in particular, and the wider feminist movement in general.<br /><br />In this regard it is interesting to note that the original feminist movement was strongly pro-life. As one of the authors informs us, \\"Without known exception, the early American feminists condemned abortion in the strongest possible terms\\". She notes the irony of the fact that the US anti-abortion laws of the latter half of the nineteenth century were the direct results of the advocacy work of the early feminists.<br /><br />Of course many in the current crop of feminists seem to believe that the right to abortion is the quintessential feminist issue. But as these twelve women argue, that is not necessarily the case.<br /><br />Indeed, a central theme of these essays is that women have been the big loser in the Sexual Revolution, and that abortion-on-demand is harmful to women. Pro-choice feminists and their allies have assured women that sexual freedom and abortion for any reason would bring them liberation and wholeness. Instead we see bondage and disintegration, argue the authors.<br /><br />There has been a high price paid by women especially, although all of society has suffered. But women have born the brunt of the broken promises, with many harmful mental, medical and psychological consequences. Entire chapters are devoted to some of these social problems and health risks, and rightly so, because the mainstream media is often quite reluctant to let the truth be told about such complications.<br /><br />A number of essays look at the very real physical consequences of women who have abortions. The research clearly shows that abortion is associated with an increased long-term risk of breast cancer, pre-term birth, maternal suicide and a host of other medical complications.<br /><br />The abortion-breast cancer link for example is quite extensively documented. If women were told of just this one possible risk, much harm could be prevented. Indeed, it could mean that many thousands of women might be saved each year.<br /><br />Elizabeth Fox-Genovese goes so far as to say that abortion is really a \\"war against women\\". Another author argues that while women are the big losers, there are several major beneficiaries. Certainly abortionists are getting the benefits: they are getting rich. And men have also benefited: they can simply \\"love `em and leave `em\\" and not face any of the consequences, while women are left holding the bag, or the baby.<br /><br />Another author makes the connection between abortion and the return of eugenics. The push for designer babies and the attempt to weed out any imperfections in our offspring is taking us back to some dark times in recent history. But we seem to have short memories. Thus we are now putting a whole new generation at risk in our search for the perfect baby. Such eugenic activity is clearly of a piece with the abortion mentality.<br /><br />The cumulative case against abortion as expressed in these essays should be enough for many women to have a rethink. Indeed, many of the authors in this book did just that: many were originally pro-choice, but as they became exposed to the truth of the issue, they had a radical change of mind and heart.<br /><br />Perhaps other women reading these essays will undergo similar sorts of conversion. For their sakes, as well as for the sake of the unborn, and all of society, it is hoped that this is indeed the case.ey had a radical change of mind and heart. <br /> <br />Perhaps other women reading these essays will undergo similar sorts of conversion.

He is also a Christian. So what does philosophy have to do with Christianity? Or as Tertullian put it long ago, what does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?<br /><br />Well quite a bit really, according to Kreeft. For example, both are, or should be, concerned with truth, or the discovery of truth. Both are concerned about going beyond appearances and getting at reality.<br /><br />Thus Kreeft thinks philosophy, properly understood and practiced, can be a real aid to the believer. This book is an introductory primer to philosophy, or more specifically, to doing philosophy. Kreeft thinks that Plato/Socrates may have been our greatest philosopher, and his works make for an excellent entry point to philosophy. (Kreeft side-steps the historical debate over Socrates, and for his/our purposes, we will simply speak of Socrates.)<br /><br />Three dialogues that exemplify Socrates' method and manner are here focused on: the Apology of Socrates, the Euthyphro, and the Phaedo. Kreeft enjoys using these dialogues as they do not just talk about philosophy but they actually show us philosophy in action.<br /><br />The Apology is the main text focused on. In it Kreeft tells us forty different things about philosophy and the philosophical method. As we all know, philosophy is the love of wisdom. It differs from mere knowledge, and God is its source. While God has wisdom, man pursues it. In this Socrates and biblical religion are on common ground.<br /><br />Moreover, the quest of philosophy is not for truth as found in the physical sciences, but moral and eternal truths, as found in religion. Moral questions, like \\"What is justice?\\" cannot be answered by the physical sciences.<br /><br />Also, belief in God and the really important things in life goes hand in hand with humility. Socrates stressed this, as do many of the great religions. Skepticism about God tends to correlate with pride, while true wisdom recognizes its limits, and is open to truth outside its limited perceptions.<br /><br />And Socrates, like Jesus, was a real counter-culturalist. Indeed, both men were hated by many because of their challenges to the status quo. Indeed, both were ultimately put to death.<br /><br />Of course in all this Kreeft does not equate the two great men. Socrates could only claim to be a seeker after truth, while Jesus claimed to be the truth.<br /><br />A key issue raised in the Euthyphro is the connection between God and goodness. Can we be good without God? The two options presented are, 1) that God chooses what is good (Euthyphro's position), and 2) that God is subject to what is good (Socrates' position). Of course Christians tend to say that this is a false dilemma, and argue for a third position, that God's goodness is coterminous with his nature. Position one seems to make God arbitrary, and position two seems to make goodness greater than God. But the third option fully equates goodness with God. What God commands is good because it is in accord with his own good nature.<br /><br />The last work examined, the Phaedo, is the story of the death of Socrates. It is also the argument of Socrates for why life extends beyond the grave, for why the soul is immortal.<br /><br />The \\"gadfly of Athens\\" was put to death for his search for truth. Of course Jesus was put to death for his proclamation of truth. To refer to the earlier discussion about historicity, Kreeft reminds us that while Christianity cannot survive without Christ, philosophy can survive without an historical Socrates. Even if he is just the creation of Plato's pen, his timeless truths live on.<br /><br />It was Alfred North Whitehead who once said that the European philosophical tradition \\"consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\\" No one can improve upon the greatness of Plato/Socrates. His greatness and wisdom live on. Thus there is so much we can learn from Socrates, so much we are indebted to.<br /><br />He is not the equivalent of Christ, but he bears many similarities, as Kreeft points out throughout this book. And there are real shortcomings to Socrates. His insistence on the importance of the soul was as valuable as his denial of the importance of the body was flawed.<br /><br />Believers need not be ashamed of nor afraid of philosophy. In its proper form, it leads us to truth. And in the Christian tradition, God is truth. Of course in a fallen world, extrnal revelation is needed to supplement internal inquiry.<br /><br />But is it possible that God can use pre-Christians like Socrates to teach us much about life and even Himself? Kreeft thinks so, and this book goes a long way in showing Christians how to appreciate the beauties of philosophy. Of course in other books in this series, Kreeft shows the dark side of reckless philosophy (as in his discussions about Sartre and Marx). But here we learn of the good purposes which philosophy can serve./> <br />He is not the equivalent of Christ, but he bears many similarities, as Kreeft points out throughout this book.

US	52661388	R2L2FVOKT63RA2	1882926811	334348020	The West and the Rest: Globalization and the Terrorist Threat	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Clear thinking on difficult issues	Although relatively brief (161 pages) this volume is densely packed with careful analysis and incisive observation. Subtitled \\"Globalization and the Terrorist Threat,\\" this book explores a number of related themes. A major thesis is how modern Western democracies differ from other types of societies in general, and the Islamic world in particular. His historical and philosophical investigations provide a framework in which to judge both the September 11 attacks, and the ongoing threat of Islamic terrorism.<br /><br />He begins by noting that social bonding can take place by means of either religion or politics. In the pluralistic West, social cohesion is mainly found in the form of the social contract, whereas in the Islamic world, religion alone provides that basis. Roman law and the Christian religion helped provide the basis for the social contract, as well as bring about the Western conception of the demarcation of the religious and political spheres.<br /><br />Islamic societies on the other hand know of no separation of religious and secular authorities, with religion the sole basis of the state. Just as the Communist party was a law onto itself, so \\"Islam aims to control the state without being a subject of the state\\". As a result, there are no political or social mediating structures between Allah and His will (Islam) and the submissive Muslim (Islamic citizen).<br /><br />The freedoms of a democracy, including the freedom to oppose the state, to vote for alternative parties, and to freely express dissenting opinions are thus not to be found in Islamic states. In theocracies, such dissent is just not possible. And given that Islam means submission, the good Muslim is an obedient Muslim.<br /><br />Both secular Western societies and Muslim societies have notions of membership. Membership in the West is made up of the voluntary, the tribal, the linguistic and the political. Muslim membership is credal, based only on the religious. The political process of the West allows for the separation of society from the state, while there is no such distinction in Islamic jurisdictions. Thus the political is the religious, whereas the genius of Western democracies is to separate the political from the rest of social and personal life.<br /><br />Democratic citizenship helps to limit state power and deter totalitarian temptations. However as the onslaught of radical individualism and secularism sweep the West, former loyalties and the sense of social membership are quickly giving way. As the concept of citizenship disappears, social membership is strained and the basis of democracies is undermined. In the light of such social and political fragmentation, the religious membership of Islamic societies stands in sharp contrast.<br /><br />However Islamic unity is based on force and power, not consent. Religious toleration, taken for granted in the West, is a foreign concept in Islamic societies. Islamic law applies to every aspect of life, and leads to the denial of the political. All is religious, and mediating structures are unheard of.<br /><br />While Christianity teaches us to give to Caesar what is his, in Islamic thinking nothing is Caesar's, everything is Allah's. All is religious because all is Allah's. Thus Islamic membership is all-embracing and all-demanding.<br /><br />But Western membership, or citizenship is unraveling, making Western democracies vulnerable and lacking in direction. Thus the inability of Western nations to unite against the real dangers of terrorism. Thus the mistaken notions of moral equivalence, where ruthless Muslim dictatorships are seen as no better or no worse than Western leadership. Thus the real possibility of the continued demise of the West coupled with a resurgent rise of Islam.<br /><br />Yes there are exceptions, such as authoritarian democracies (e.g Singapore) and democratic Muslim states (Turkey being the only real example). But Islamic nations are inherently undemocratic. The politicalfreedoms we enjoy in the West are largely unheard of in Islamic societies. And while the majority of Muslims do not support terrorism and murder, enough do to make for a lengthy battle between the West and Islam.<br /><br />In the past Christians may have wrongly used the edge of the sword to command loyalty to the faith, but that has always been a perversion of Christ's gospel, not a fulfillment of it. But for a Muslim to take up the sword for Islam against the unbeliever is both sensible for a member of a theocracy and endorsed (at least in some interpretations) in the Koran.<br /><br />Indeed, terrorism and conquest have a long history in Islam. And modern Western-trained Muslims, backed with Western technology and the revenue of Arabian oil wells, have made for the kind of terrorism witnessed in New York and Bali. Many explanations and justifications for such terrorism have been put forward, but the truth is, as Scruton documents, \\"Islamism is not a cry of distress from the `wretched of the earth.' It is an implacable summon to war, issued by globetrotting middle-class Muslims\\".<br /><br />Since opposition cannot be found in Islamic countries, only a re-invigorated West can adequately deal with the terrorist threat (and Muslim terrorism against other Muslims is not uncommon). But this requires a renewal of the idea of citizenship and community, and a renunciation of radical versions of individualism and secularism. The religious (mainly Judeo-Christian) basis of Western democracies needs to be revived and encouraged not just in the private sphere but in the public as well.<br /><br />Thus Scruton's book is not only a warning about the anti-democratic makeup of Islamic societies, but a wake-up call to the West to re-explore its roots and re-establish its moral and cultural foundations. Without a revived West the prospects for the war against Islamic terrorism look bleak. But this volume helps to remind us that the stakes are high and some things are worth fighting for. Hopefully this book will serve as a much-needed call to action by the West. If not, we have much to fear from the future.ic.

In 1932 Aldous Huxley wrote his prophetic and chilling novel, Brave New World. In it he mapped out a future in which science, instead of being a great help to mankind, becomes the undoing of human nature and personhood.<br /><br />Seventy years on one has to ask where we now stand. Smith thinks the picture does not look good. While we can all be grateful for advances in science and technology which have extended life, healed diseases, and made us all much more comfortable, there is also a dark side to this progress. It is this negative side, and its potential, that this volume addresses.<br /><br />Smith looks at many of the recent and controversial issues in biotechnology, chief among them, genetic engineering, human cloning and stem cell research. He does a good job of explaining where we are with these developments, and the various possible shortcomings they may raise.<br /><br />But of real value in this book is the author's concern to not just focus on the biotechnologies alone, but to look at the bigger picture. Where are these developments taking us as human beings? How are these new advances impacting on our understanding of humanity and human worth? Are moral and ethical concerns being swept under the carpet as we race ahead with scientific breakthroughs?<br /><br />Smith reminds us that it is all too easy for prudence and ethical interests to be sidelined in the chase for fame and fortune. Careful, objective science can easily be compromised and marginalised when so much is at stake.<br /><br />Smith notes that we now see the rise of a new scientific-industrial complex, every bit as worrying as past alliances with the private sector. Both academia and the scientific community are becoming increasingly cozy with the profit-making community. While that may not be bad in itself, an unduly cozy relationship may well mean trouble ahead.<br /><br />Thus the reality of Big Biotech is now a genuine concern as much as is Big Oil or Big Tobacco. As but one indication, in the past quarter century $100 billion has been poured into the biotech sector. As a result biotechnology companies today are largely research and fund-raising machines. And the old adage of `those who pay the piper call the tune' is very much a real concern.<br /><br />And the money trail flows in all directions. Not only does Big Business drive much of the biotech agenda, but the latter in turn spends billions each year in public relations and political campaigns. The industry has many staff working full-time as paid-lobbyists and PR wizards, actively seeking to influence not only public opinion but the flow of tax-dollars.<br /><br />Of course many of these biotech companies have ethical advisors who are meant to act as a safeguard against any untoward influences. The real fear is that this is just a case of ethics for sale. Many of these bioethicists are simply putting the company spin on things. Few are genuinely objective, neutral and independent. Most are in the pay of their masters and will happily do their masters' bidding. After all, if the main concern is to get a good return on investment to stockholders, what company will hire an ethicist to work against that concern?<br /><br />Smith documents numerous cases of such questionable ethical advice, and how financial concerns very clearly determine much of the direction of the biotech industry.<br /><br />Another major concern highlighted in this book is the transformation of objective science into scientism. Scientism is the idea that science alone, unclouded by any moral and other input, can decide what is best for us. Science is seen as saviour and the sole source of truth. The humility and objectivity needed for good science are jettisoned for an ideology that eschews other considerations.<br /><br />This of course is a real concern, since much of the new bioscience is dealing with issues that have profound consequences for humanity and society. With so much at stake, other influences need to be brought to bear. Philosophical, theological and ethical input is crucially needed, but is often rejected altogether. Science begins to be seen as an end in itself, instead of a means to an end.<br /><br />Thus science itself is becoming tainted in this process, and any concerns about how humanity may suffer as a result are seldom discussed. But Smith certainly raises the issues. He knows that the political and financial pressures brought to bear on the biosciences are having a very real negative effect.<br /><br />One clear negative effect is the return of eugenics. This can especially be seen in the rise of Transhumanism. This philosophy states that any means available could and should be used to enhance individuals and their progeny. A very well funded and organised Transhumanist movement is quite clear about its goals: the transformation of human evolution by means of bioengineering and other emerging techniques. The aim is to create a \\"posthuman\\" species, free of the defects and limitations of mere humanity.<br /><br />But the pursuit of human perfection always comes at a price. We should have learned our lessons years ago. But we are ignoring those lessons and repeating those mistakes. All the warnings of Huxley and others are falling on deaf ears.<br /><br />Thus this book serves as a wake-up call. There are tremendous goods and benefits to come from the new technologies, and Smith is quick to point those out, but there are very real fears as well.<br /><br />The future is very much in our hands, and Smith reminds us that it is not enough to have science alone or the marketplace alone determine how we proceed. The advances of science and technology need to be counterbalanced by advances in ethical and social reflection. And this volume very nicely serves that purpose.fluences need to be brought to bear.

His daily radio commentary, Breakpoint, provides short, punchy and pithy observations on the current scene, be it social, political, moral or cultural.<br /><br />His incisive commentary is fully informed by a thoroughly biblical world view. Thus he offers a good counter-balance to the relativistic, politically correct and postmodern mindset. Those who may have missed these radio commentaries (or simply prefer the printed word) will be grateful to see many of the better and more recent broadcasts collected into a single volume.<br /><br />The commentaries are broken own into seven sections: individualism and rights; marriage and family; tolerance and society; the arts; Christianity and culture; the media; and spirituality in culture. Each section contains around a dozen of the short, but meaty, commentaries.<br /><br />Taken together, the 90 or so pieces cover many of the current events and social issues being discussed today. With so much uninformed commentary, and/or viewpoints representing every perspective but that of biblical Christianity, it is good to see a decidedly Christian version of events.<br /><br />In an age where truth is in short supply, where morality is hard to come by, and everyone seems to be doing what is right in their own eyes, the words of reason, wisdom and truth found here make for refreshing reading.<br /><br />The trouble is, it is not just secularists who are so much in need of biblical truth. Many who call themselves Christians are also desperately in need. Too many believers have slavishly followed the trends of the world, instead of setting counter-cultural trends of their own.<br /><br />This book will help believers to get back to where they should be, and will also help non-believers to rethink many of their currently held positions. It is time to challenge the lies that are so prevalent and pervasive in contemporary culture, and this volume offers a great place to start with in such an important task.t place to start with in such an important task. <br />	2005-09-16

Guinness, one of our finest Christian commentators and thinkers, argues that the issue of suffering and evil is our most urgent and serious problem.<br /><br />Evil may have been always with us, but Guinness argues that for the first time in human history, many people no longer have a coherent moral and intellectual framework with which to assess it. More disturbing, we no longer have a shared understanding about whether there even is such a thing as evil.<br /><br />Ironically, while the scale and scope of evil has increased in the modern world, our ability to respond to it has weakened. Because of the \\"sorry state of moral illiteracy and intellectual cowardice\\" that we moderns find ourselves in, we have a hard time even recognizing evil. Or worse still, we simply make excuses for it.<br /><br />Utopian views of human goodness and a refusal to face reality have resulted in a moral myopia that cannot call evil evil. Indeed, postmodernism compounds the problem, by arguing that calling something evil is the real crime. PoMo has \\"spawned legions of people who pronounce all judgments of evil to be judgmental and evil themselves\\".<br /><br />Guinness spends a lot of time asking questions about evil and suffering, saving tentative answers for the end of his book. The questions themselves reveal a very deep and nuanced struggle with the issue. Guinness has drawn deeply from the wells of human reflection on, and interaction with, the subject of pain and suffering. His many incisive quotes from a range of authors, thinkers, philosophers and religions are alone worth the price of the book.<br /><br />As part of his investigation, he describes in detail three main responses to the problem of evil. The three main families of faith in the modern world are the Eastern, the secular, and the Judeo-Christian.<br /><br />Eastern responses to evil include that of Hinduism, Buddhism, and much of the New Age Movement. A common theme of the Eastern approach is that there is no real solution to evil in this world, only the renunciation of this world. Freedom from evil means freedom from individuality. If the East is world-denying, the next main option is world-affirming.<br /><br />In the secularist family of faith (atheism, naturalism, secular humanism, etc.) evil is something that we alone must confront. There is no God to help us, so we must create our own paradise on earth. And we have certainly seen some robust attempts in the past century to do just that. Great experiments in producing a new man and a new social order have been tried, but only to be found greatly wanting. The grand social utopias, be they of Stalin, Hitler or Mao have all resulted in the most horrific bloodshed known to man.<br /><br />Secularist regimes with secularist visions of heaven on earth have only led to hell on earth. Indeed, more people were killed by the secularists in the twentieth century than all other ideologies combined before then.<br /><br />The last family, the great monotheistic faiths, has quite a different spin on things. The Judeo-Christian tradition sees evil as an intrusion into this world. Things are not the way they are supposed to be. Evil is unnatural and an intruder. The doctrine of creation tells us about how the world was meant to be, while the doctrine of the fall tells us what has gone wrong. But it does not end there. In the Christian version of things, the doctrine of redemption tells us how evil has been faced head on, and how it has been, and ultimately will be, overcome. Thus we can join in fighting against evil without seen to be fighting against God.<br /><br />God does not abandon us in our struggle against evil. Indeed, \\"no other god has wounds,\\" Guinness reminds us. In the Eastern view, detachment is the solution. In the secular view, denial or utopianism is the proposed course. In the Christian view, God enters into our predicament, suffers for us and with us, and leads us in the way ahead.<br /><br />The three views could not be more different. In the Christian religion, not only is there a plausible explanation for evil, but there is the conviction that something has been done about it. God has entered human history and confronted sheer evil. And the sheer love of God has defeated this evil.<br /><br />Of course the mystery of evil can never be fathomed, at least in this world. In the Hebrew scriptures a whole book was devoted to the subject. Job asked a lot of questions which were never answered. \\"In the end, rather than getting an answer from God, Job encounters God himself, which is his answer.\\"<br /><br />The timeless truths of the Christian faith will not satisfy everyone. And as Guinness points out, some of the most anguished cries against God concerning the problem of evil have come from believers, not atheists. The Christian solution must be weighed up and compared to its chief rivals.<br /><br />No one system may completely satisfy. But by means of  a careful presentation of the main alternatives, this book helps to lay out the quite different approaches to this vexatious problem, helping all pilgrims along the way to see more clearly and perhaps more hopefully.<br /><br />If this book ultimately sheds little new light on the subject, it is because it does not claim to do so. It can only restate what has gone before. And this restatement is superbly done. And given the age of terrorism and genocide that we find ourselves in, the demand for a careful restatement is more urgent than ever.dicament, suffers for us and with us, and leads us in the way ahead. <br /> <br />The three views could not be more different.

Books	5	175	242	N	N	Marshalling the troops	This book makes for scary reading. Even if it were only half true (which I do not think is the case), it would still be very scary reading. The sad truth of the book is that there is a war going on, and those who hold to faith and family values are subject to a relentless and focused attack.<br /><br />Many of us have been aware of some of the moves to silence believers, to push activist agendas, to stifle freedom and to straightjacket the churches. But to see all this information concentrated in a book which can be read in one sitting makes for sobering reading.<br /><br />And many of us have been aware of the persecution of believers in countries such as China, North Korea and Sudan. It seems harder to believe that active persecution and suppression of the faith is happening in the \\"Christian\\" West. But that is indeed the case.<br /><br />In this book horror story after horror story is laid out, documenting the very real assaults on our freedoms and our faith. Consider but a few examples.<br /><br />-Believers in Philadelphia faced felony charges and jail time for simply quoting from the Bible in public.<br /><br />-Two Christians (one heavily pregnant) were ordered off a bus and had to walk home in the rain because the driver said their discussion of their faith might \\"offend\\" other passengers on the bus.<br /><br />-A Canadian believer and print shop owner who declined to print homosexual material was found guilty of discrimination by the Ontario Human Rights Commission and fined $5000, which went to the homosexual group. He also now has to pay off a $170,000 legal fee.<br /><br />-A group called American United for Separation of Church and State is sending people to churches to monitor sermons to see if there are any so-called church/state separation violations.<br /><br />-In Quebec government officials removed a child from her Baptist family because \\"they might have unusual beliefs regarding child-rearing\\".<br /><br />-In a California town $500,000 of public money was spent on constructing a statue to an Aztec god. The Aztecs of course were notorious for their countless child sacrifices. While this was held to be a \\"cultural symbol,\\" the same council removed a nativity scene.<br /><br />-A pro-homosexual ordinance in Madison Wisconsin resulted in this outrage: Two women advertised for a roommate. When they declined to take in a lesbian, they were forced by the Equal Opportunity Commission to attend \\"sensitivity training\\", pay the lesbian $1500, write a formal apology, and have their housing situation \\"monitored\\" for two years. One of the women said in tears that she felt like she was living in totalitarian China instead of democratic America.<br /><br />Such examples can be multiplied at length. Every day new anti-faith outrages are taking place, and the obvious question to ask is: \\"How long before Christianity is outlawed altogether?\\"<br /><br />As can be seen, some of these threats to religious freedom come by way of the homosexual activists. But there are plenty of other threats to those concerned about faith and family. Radical civil libertarian groups and pro-abortion activists also come to mind. And the author has certainly been involved with these groups before, especially in her many years as a tireless pro-life campaigner. Indeed, her first book, True to Life, describes her remarkable work on behalf of the unborn.<br /><br />Her first book contained a number of examples of how creative and thoughtful activities can be implemented to work for a culture of life. That same concern for pro-active strategies and tactics is found here. Janet Folger does not just highlight the war we are in, but also offers practical help in how we can win these battles.<br /><br />A threefold plan of attack is laid out: working together; moving from defense to offense; and controlling the debate. We cannot just sit by and respond in only a defensive position, but we must work together to preemptively and proactively tackle the issues. She ends her book by looking at how various successes already have been achieved, and how in this fight we must recognize the spiritual battle which is also taking place.<br /><br />The job of any good prophet is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. And Janet Folger, in true prophetic fashion, manages to do both in this timely and important book. Those who have been involved in the culture wars will not find too much new material here. And some may question her concluding comments on the end times. But all should find a renewed hope and sense of calling to confront the many challenges we face.

And Jean-Paul Sartre was a major figure in the existentialist movement. His non-fiction was influential, but his non-fiction impacted millions.<br /><br />A solid Christian introduction to his life and thought is certainly needed, and this volume admirably does the job. Boston College Professor of Philosophy Peter Kreeft writes in the form of an imaginary dialogue between Socrates and Sartre, set in the afterlife. This technique Kreeft has used before with great success, in a series of books on the great thinkers and the great books.<br /><br />In this volume he introduces us to the main tenets of Sartre's existentialism, critiquing the man and his philosophy by means of the Socratic method in particular, and the biblical worldview in general. From both vantage points, Sartre and his thinking are found to be seriously wanting.<br /><br />Sartre was of course a French philosopher who along with Albert Camus and others championed the movement known as existentialism, which emphasised choice and freedom, but in Sartre's case, denied God and value. (There is such a beast as Christian existentialism, as best represented by Kierkegaard.)<br /><br />Sartre was a fairly consistent atheist, who recognised that if God does not exist, then neither does good and evil, or love, or truth, or value. Life in the end is absurd and meaningless. He did seem to mind the very grim consequences of his worldview. But most people would be bothered. Sartre may have been consistent, but his consistency demonstrates that atheism so lived is really unlivable.<br /><br />For example, Sartre famously said that \\"hell is other people\\". Well, if one really believes that and tries to live that, then life becomes unlivable. Certainly society, relationships, community, love and commitment become unlivable. Not many people really want to live in a world like that.<br /><br />Of course as Kreeft rightly notes, it will only be in hell that Sartre will find what he really seems to be looking for: the eternal loneliness and absence of love. Indeed, he would not be able to enjoy heaven even if he did make it there: it would be the polar opposite of everything his philosophy stands for.<br /><br />Kreeft notes that this consistent but repulsive atheism is perhaps only matched in Nietzsche, whose life was equally tragic. Indeed, Sartre's creed was really quite ugly. If choice is the highest good (if one can speak of goods in his worldview), and the act of choosing, not the object of choosing, is all that matters, then to choose to be a Hitler as opposed to a Mother Teresa matters not at all. What does matter is that choice was exercised.<br /><br />For Sartre fighting with the Nazis or against them is all of a piece. Try telling that to a Jew in Auschwitz, Kreeft (through Socrates) reminds Sartre. Of course Sartre did take up various (leftwing) causes, but there was certainly no ethical justification for doing so, according to his own system.<br /><br />With no values except raw choice, human society really becomes unworkable. And in such a world if any two people can find common ground and get along, it would just be dumb luck. In the end, the life-denying worldview of Sartre leads to isolation, fragmentation and death. It does not lead to life, community, love or anything that makes life worthwhile.<br /><br />Kreeft has done a very good job of not just analysing the worldview of Sartre, but of showing its many and profound deficiencies as well. One eagerly awaits his cross-examination of other great thinkers and their thoughts.s, it will only be in hell that Sartre will find what he really seems to be looking for: the eternal loneliness and absence of love.

In it he urged us to think clearly and with moral discernment about the issues of nuclear deterrence, justice and warfare. This volume serves a similar function, except in the context of the modern dilemma of international terrorism.<br /><br />The main focus of the book however is to provide a thorough description and defense of classic just war theory. Written by a Christian ethicist mainly for the Christian community, the author lays out the various options relating to issues of war and peace. Of course the two major options throughout church history have been pacifism and just war doctrine. The former, while always a minority opinion, has had many champions throughout the ages.<br /><br />The latter position, just war theory, has had a long and honorable heritage, both in religious and non-religious circles. The position holds, in brief, that there are some occasions in which a war may be fought with moral justification. It stipulates some of the reasons why it may be just to enter into such a conflict (jus ad bellum) and how such a war may be justly waged (jus in bello).<br /><br />Charles traces the development of this doctrine through Christian history, and seeks to defend it in the face of numerous objections. Like Novak before him, he especially seeks to sharpen our moral clarity concerning the difficult questions raised in the debate, and equip believers to think deeply and critically about how their faith intersects with such contentious social and political issues.<br /><br />And like Novak, he is unhappy with the sloppy thinking and muddied moral waters that often occur in these debates. Just as Novak could object to the foolish notion of moral equivalence prominent during the Cold War era (which sought to show that there was no moral difference between the free and democratic West and the oppressive Marxist regimes), so Charles rejects the glib claims that actions to resist international terrorism are no better morally than the terrorist act themselves.<br /><br />If Novak had to deal with moral myopia and intellectual vandalism at the time of the Cold War era debates, the matters have only gotten worse. As Charles points out, our post-modern climate has only exasperated the problem. Not only are we no longer thinking with moral clarity and vigor, but we have abandoned the very notion of a moral framework in which to make ethical judgments. Indeed, post-modernism discourages us from making moral judgements at all.<br /><br />Thus the need to once again state the case for just war theory, to show its historical and intellectual roots, and to demonstrate how it is an important tool by which we assess armed conflict and geo-political conflict. The urgency of the terrorist threat requires some hard thinking, moral realism, and theological discernment.<br /><br />As such a number of issues are canvassed. For example, does the biblical injunction against vengeance preclude the right of nations (and individuals for that matter) to defend themselves? Charles rightly reminds us that retribution is not the moral equivalent of revenge. Retributive justice does not equal vindictive revenge. Societies have an obligation to maintain peace with justice, to defend the innocent, and to actively work against injustice and exploitation.<br /><br />Other crucial questions are considered. What about pre-emptive strikes? Are they ever morally justified? What about the use of coercive force in peace-keeping missions? Is that an oxymoron? All of these specific questions need to be debated within a larger theological and ethical matrix. And Charles argues that a thoroughly biblical understanding of important concepts such as peace, justice and the right use of force clearly lead to a doctrine of just warfare.<br /><br />The particulars of any individual case will of course be open to discussion and debate. But in an age inwhich no one is now safe from the deadly hands of terrorist bombers, it is vital that Western nations in general and people of the faith community in particular do some sober and profound thinking about these issues. This volume is a very helpful tool in such an endeavour..

How is it that the framers of the EU document utterly fail to acknowledge the Christian heritage of Europe? Can European democracy long flourish in a culture that rejects the heritage that give birth to it? And what future is there for a free Europe which has spiritual and cultural amnesia, forgetting its very foundations?<br /><br />These questions are explored in an important new book by American social commentator and Catholic theologian, George Weigel. He argues that there are two main competing visions for the future of Europe. One is that of secularism as represented by the La Grande Arche in Paris, a huge glass and metal cube built to commemorate the bicentenary of the French Revolution.<br /><br />The other is Christianity, as represented by Notre-Dame Cathedral, which tourists are informed can easily fit into the grand cube.<br /><br />One vision follows a two-hundred year history of humanism, secularism, and atheism. The other follows the two thousand year history of the Christian church. Which vision, asks Weigel, can better protect democracy, human rights and meaning and purpose for modern Europe? Which vision will hold sway?<br /><br />Weigel argues that the answers to these questions will also help explain the issue of the \\"Europe problem\\". For example, how does one account for Europe's weakness in the face of international terrorism, it refusal to recognise the failures - and terror - of communism, its declining fertility rates, its fixation with international organisations such as the International Criminal Court and the UN, and its rampant Christophobia?<br /><br />Why has Europe repudiated its Judeo-Christian foundations and embraced secular humanism? Can such a Faustian bargain be in its best interests?<br /><br />Weigel argues that nations survive not just on economic or political strengths, but on cultural, moral and spiritual realities as well. It is culture and religion that ultimately makes for strong nations. What men and women honour, cherish, worship and value will determine a nation's future.<br /><br />But as modern Europe has done its best to minimise, ignore or repudiate the moral/cultural/religious factor, it is in the process of digging its own grave.<br /><br />After traversing the various historical and philosophical cross-currents leading up the current \\"Europe problem\\", Weigel reminds us of what Europe would look like if denuded of its Christian heritage. Gone would be a myriad of famous names, which he takes pains to list. Here are just a few, from the `B' list: Bach, Bacon, Becket, Bede, Benedict, Bernard of Clairvaux, Bonhoeffer, Boniface, and Bosch.<br /><br />It was out of the Judeo-Christian worldview that such thinkers, writers, artists and scientists emerged. To seek to wish away that background is to commit cultural and social suicide, something Europe in now firmly embarked upon. In truth, \\"there is no understanding Europe without Christianity\\".<br /><br />Indeed, were it not for the Christian heritage that brought them into existence, we would not be experiencing the many institutions we now enjoy and take for granted (democracy, rule of law, open markets, genuine pluralism, etc.). As Weigel reminds us, the democratic project did not emerge as \\"a kind of political virgin birth\\". It arose out of rich soil: that of Judeo-Christian religion.<br /><br />Solzhenitsyn long ago warned that it is because we have forgotten God that our current troubles are upon us. Europe is now at a crossroads. It can re-embrace its past, and enjoy again the well-oiled machinery of democracy and freedom. Or it can reject that past, embrace its opposite, and see that machinery break down.<br /><br />A society cannot hope to hang on the institutions it values if it rejects the preconditions for those institutions. Europe was birthed in a Judeo-Christian environment, and can only flourish if keptthere. If post-Christian Europe continues to embrace the cube, the future looks bleak indeed. If it once again embraces the cathedral, then there is hope. And the history of Europe - and the world - hangs in the balance.can only flourish if kept there. If post-Christian Europe continues to embrace the cube, the future looks bleak indeed. If it once again embraces the cathedral, then there is hope.

One of the great Christian apologists, writers and thinkers of the last century is discussed by one of the best of this century. Peter Kreeft, Professor of Philosophy at Boston College, here gives us an introduction to the thought and influence of the great Oxford don.<br /><br />Both authors are known for their clarity of mind, their prolific literary output, and their commitment to the truths of historic Christianity. And both authors have been known as fearless warriors against the prevailing secularism and relativism of our culture.<br /><br />Indeed, a major target of Lewis's pen was modernism and all that it entails. The rejection of the sacred and the elevation of the secular was a defining feature of modernism. It meant the exaltation of human reason and the rejection of non-human revelation. Autonomous man, guided only by intellect, could usher in a perfect world, accompanied by science and technology. Such a utopian quest was doomed to failure of course, and many of Lewis's works were directed at this theme.<br /><br />The Abolition of Man was a classic volume in this regard. So too was the third volume of his space trilogy, That Hideous Strength. The naïve and baseless belief of modernism that fallen reason, aided and abetted by science (really scientism), could create a new man and an earthly paradise has been the cause of more human misery and death than any other worldview.<br /><br />The Judeo-Christian worldview, which gave rise to Western civilisation, has been repudiated, resulting in a host of heresies that beguile modern man. Kreeft lists twenty \\"isms\\" that Lewis waged war against, all the products of the modernist rejection of it transcendent roots. These include subjectivism, cultural relativism, utilitarianism, pragmatism, cynicism, hedonism, and secularism.<br /><br />These destructive isms plaguing the West today are part of a much bigger sweep of history. Lewis argued that the history of Western civilisation has been characterised by two monumental spiritual revolutions, the first from pre-Christian to Christian, the second from Christian to post-Christian.<br /><br />He argued that the second revolution was more radical than the first, just \\"as divorce is more traumatic than marriage\\". The second change is happening quicker and is more destabilising. As a result, the soul of Western civilisation is dying. The real question is how long and how deep this second revolution will run.<br /><br />The first revolution however is the permanent one. It may appear to have been eclipsed for now, but our vantage point is limited. True, the new dark ages may continue for quite sometime. Writing six years before the new millennium, Kreeft could argue that we have two options: \\"Either we will build Gothic cathedrals again, from a restored faith, or we will build the Tower of Babel again, from a restored apostasy\\".<br /><br />As a prophetic figure, Lewis could clearly see the  stark choice facing the West. He knew that if we rejected the right choice, many more horrors would await us. But if we choose wisely, the new dawn will soon arise.<br /><br />The six meaty essays in this book offer the way out of the spiritual, cultural and intellectual morass we find ourselves in. The prophetic vision and insight of Lewis needs to be captured again by a new generation.

First published in 1985, a much needed second edition appeared in 1993. But with further ethical reflection called for, especially in the rapidly developing area of bio-technology, a third edition was in need, and here is the result.<br /><br />This new edition features a new chapter on genetic engineering, which looks at the history, technology and morality of such issues as cloning and stem cell research. There is also a new chapter on environmental ethics. In addition to addressing some contemporary environmental concerns such as global warming and biodiversity, it offers a biblical foundation for thinking about the earth and our stewardship of it.<br /><br />And the existing ten chapters have been revised as well, bringing statistical and bibliographic information up to date.<br /><br />The opening chapter lays out some general principles of ethical thinking from a biblical viewpoint, including the problem of conflicting obligations, and the place of Christian morality in a pluralistic culture.<br /><br />The other nine chapters focus on major ethical and social hot potatoes of the day. Thus there are meaty chapters on such issues as contraception, reproductive technologies, homosexuality, abortion, war and peace, and capital punishment.<br /><br />All the issues are approached from a decidedly biblical and socially conservative standpoint. Thus in the chapters on abortion and euthanasia, a strong pro-life stance is argued for as the one most closely reflecting the biblical data.<br /><br />On the issue of war and defence, Davis argues that the Christian case for pacifism rests on a weak hermeneutical basis, and that the just war tradition, including nuclear deterrence, is morally justifiable.<br /><br />On the related issue of capital punishment, the author takes the view that it is still a binding principle, not limited to Old Testament times. It reflects both the justice of God as well as his wrath against the wrongdoer.<br /><br />On the thorny issue of divorce and remarriage, Davis argues that while God hates divorce (Mal. 2:16), there are cases, such as sexual infidelity and desertion, where divorce is morally permissible, though not obligatory. Reconciliation should be the main emphasis, with divorce seen as a painful last resort.<br /><br />Homosexuality is not overlooked. The social, medical and theological components of this discussion are all well covered. Davis argues that homosexuality is contrary to the divine will for human sexuality, and real hope is available for the homosexual who seeks to renounce his lifestyle.<br /><br />In sum, this book offers a clearly biblical approach to many of the controversial social and ethical debates of the day. A lot of ground is covered in the book's 350 pages. One can argue that more could have been included. For example, a full discussion of cloning and stem cell research could have been featured in a separate chapter. The very topical issue of same-sex marriage is not even mentioned in the chapter on homosexuality. Other omissions come to mind.<br /><br />But one can only cover so much material in a single volume. And Davis has elsewhere developed some of these topics further, as in his 1984 book on abortion. All in all this is one of the best books on contemporary social and ethical debate from a biblical perspective.flects both the justice of God as well as his wrath against the wrongdoer. <br /> <br />On the thorny issue of divorce and remarriage, Davis argues that while God hates divorce (Mal. 2:16), there are cases, such as sexual infidelity and desertion, where divorce is morally permissible, though not obligatory.

Phyllis Schlafly has been a dogged defender of freedom, and the matriarch of pro-family activism for four decades now. Both as a mother and a lawyer, she is well qualified to speak on how the tyranny of the courts is stamping out our freedoms and laying siege to our families.<br /><br />Her thesis is simple. For the past fifty years liberal judges have moved beyond the strict interpretation of law to the creation of law. They have become legislators, and have sought to impose their leftist bias on the rest of the community. The rule of law has thus been replaced by the rule of judges: judges who are unelected and unaccountable, foisting their vision of the good society on a hapless citizenry.<br /><br />Instead of viewing the US Constitution as a document that meant certain things by its authors, the activists speak of a \\"living and evolving Constitution\\" that can be taken to mean different things at different times. The original intent of the framers of the Constitution is jettisoned and trendy interpretations are read into the documents. The judges in fact are writing their own biased opinions into the law.<br /><br />But the American system of government was meant to include a clear separation of powers. In addition to the judiciary, there was the legislative and the executive wings of government. Not only was the judiciary not meant to be in the business of creating laws, but it was also designed to be the least powerful of the three branches of government. Schlafly shows that in many ways it now has become the most powerful.<br /><br />Indeed, this book shows that our judges have imposed taxes, dismantled laws that protect internal security, rewritten laws on the conduct of elections, and redefined the institution of marriage, to name but a few examples of judicial activism.<br /><br />Moreover, they have invented so-called rights to such things as abortion, same-sex marriage, and public funding of pornography. As Schlafly rightly notes, such social and political policies should be made by our elected representatives, and not by our unelected judges.<br /><br />Schlafly documents how this momentous change to our governance has come about. She notes that the infamous Dred Scott decision of 1857 really started the ball rolling on judicial tyranny. The Supreme Court made this pro-slavery decision by striking down a Federal law which forbade slavery in certain parts of America. Abraham Lincoln, the champion of emancipation, was appalled at the decision, and the attempt by the Court to make public policy.<br /><br />Nearly one hundred years went by before a new bout of judicial activism erupted, this time under the Warren Court. Chief Justice Earl Warren wasted no time in asserting judicial supremacy, with a number of established laws overturned, and controversial social upheaval initiated, as in his challenges to school prayer and obscenity laws. The trends started by Warren have pretty much continued unabated during the past five decades.<br /><br />Schlafly charts this half century of activism, with detailed chapters on such things as the courts' promotion of feminism, pornography, and its all-out assault on the institution of marriage. Concerning the latter, this book makes clear that both liberal judges and homosexual activists know that their agenda will never be implemented by the ballot box. The will of the people must be side-stepped by the use of judicial activism. Thus the war against marriage that we are now embroiled in.<br /><br />In addition to various state judiciaries rejecting the will of the people on the marriage debate, the federal courts as well have waded into these debates. Justice Scalia has bemoaned the activism of his colleagues, saying they are making the Constitution and the nation unrecognisable.<br /><br />Schlafy reminds us that homosexuals can marry just as anyone else can, but on the same terms. Everyone is equally banned from marriage because of certain age, relationship, and sex requirements. The truth is, most homosexuals do not want marriage. What they do want is full public acceptance and approval, and they are using the activist courts to achieve their aims.<br /><br />Schlafy concludes this volume by offering some proposals to stop the judicial supremacists. These include allowing Congress to take its impeachment powers seriously, and to work to restore the balance of powers with its system of checks and balances. Above all, ordinary citizens must take an interest in the courts and court decision, becoming informed on how America was meant to be governed. They must become involved, and raise their voices about these unwelcome trends.<br /><br />And this book serves as an important rallying cry to that end. In order for \\"we the people\\" to be truly sovereign, the warnings of this book need to be widely declared and heeded.Everyone is equally banned from marriage because of certain age, relationship, and sex requirements.

US	52661388	R2Y3EQ1YYK7VZL	0801026288	136743270	Family in the Bible: Exploring Customs, Culture, and Context	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A biblical view of family	In this volume seven experts deal with seven areas: the family in the Pentateuch, in the non-narrative sections, in the historical books, in the wisdom literature, in the prophetic literature, in the Gospels and Acts, and in the epistles. Together they provide a comprehensive account of the biblical understanding of the family.<br /><br />Old Testament scholar Gordon Wenham begins the discussion with the important early chapters of Genesis, where God's ideal for the family is first laid out. He notes that in Genesis 2, the divine intention is clearly set out, with the provision of one man and one woman for life as the ideal.<br /><br />And in contrast to contemporary life, belonging to a family was seen as the highest good for an individual. Indeed, there were no free-floating individuals in ancient Israelite society. One's place in the world was determined by belonging to one's family. The wellbeing of an individual depended on the wellbeing of the family.<br /><br />In the prophetic literature, there is a lot of information on family . Much of it is negative: families allowing worship of idols and unethical lifestyles, and so on. The injustice and oppression of Israel and Judah are often couched in terms of how families are affected. Thus the prophets railed against economic injustices which broke up the family unit, decimated ancestral family lands, caused debt servitude, etc.<br /><br />But there is also a positive side. And this comes by way of images of God which draw on the realm of family life. That God so often chooses to express himself by way of these family images shows the importance of marriage and family. Thus a number of rich metaphors of God's relationship with Israel are highlighted, all drawing on the theme of the extended family.<br /><br />One is the description of God as father. The parent-child relationship is often highlighted, either by referring to God as father, or by referring to Israel as son or daughter, or people or children. Indeed, sometimes (albeit rarely) God is spoken of as a mother as well.<br /><br />Another family term used is that of husband. God is pictured as married to Israel, and Israel is described as sometimes being the delight of God, or a vexation to God, depending on Israel's faithfulness or lack thereof to Yahweh. A final term that can be mentioned is that of kinsman redeemer. Just as a family member could help to redeem a family member or property sold off into slavery because of debt, so too God acted as a redeemer of Israel, paying the price for her spiritual impoverishment.<br /><br />When we come to the New Testament, we find a similar high regard for families. Jesus however did put family relationships in their proper context. The focus of Jesus' teaching was not primarily on social or family relationships as such, but the kingdom of God. However, that did not mean that Jesus was against the family. He put family in its proper place, in terms of discipleship and the purposes of the kingdom.<br /><br />As one writer puts it, \\"Jesus chose his disciples and taught them and the crowds about discipleship, he relativized the priority of family without being antifamily.\\"<br /><br />While the demands of Jesus sometimes set one family member against another, it also needs to be kept in mind that the main means by which the early faith spread was through family connections. Thus the emphasis on household salvation, found especially in the book of Acts.<br /><br />In the New Testament epistles the term family is used rarely, but many family images abound. A key concept would be that of the church as the bride of Christ. That of adoption as sons is another familiar metaphor used.<br /><br />Then there are the so-called household codes, which are detailed in such places as Ephesians 5, Colossians 3 and 1 Peter 2-3. Extensive discussion of the relationships among family members highlight the importance given to this institution.<br /><br />In sum, all of Scripture offers a continuity as to the significant place of marriage and family. Different emphasis may arise, but the overall thrust of the biblical record is that family life is affirmed and encouraged throughout. This book attempts to show the vital importance and central role of the family in society according to the biblical worldview. It is an important contribution towards that end.re offers a continuity as to the significant place of marriage and family.

The debate seeks to overturn millennia of accumulated wisdom on the nature of marriage. And in so doing, it may overturn the very fabric of society which has been built on marriage and family.<br /><br />Marriage is not simply a private relationship. It is a social good and a public institution. Societies have always given benefits to marriage because marriage gives benefits to society. For a society to disown its own birthright in upholding heterosexual marriage, is in effect to say that it does not care about the community, it does not care about couples, and it especially does not care about children.<br /><br />Staver here simply repeats the obvious: marriage has always been about a man and a woman. And it has always been about the possibility of procreation. Societies have a lot at stake when it comes to the next generation. In order to survive, societies must ensure that each new generation carries forth its values, it virtues and its visions. And no one can better ensure this than a child's mother and father.<br /><br />But in separating children from a mother and a father, societies are committing social suicide. The truth is, children need a mother and a father, period. The evidence is by now as overwhelming as it is familiar. Yet restating the obvious has become the order of the day. And Staver does a good job of marshalling the evidence.<br /><br />The values of two-parent families, the risks of the homosexual lifestyle, the differences between heterosexual and homosexual relationships are all detailed here. Evidence, not emotion, should channel this debate, and Staver provides copiously footnoted documentation on all these points.<br /><br />He has detailed chapters, for example, on why sexual preference is not a civil right. And he shows how sexuality-based lifestyles are not on a par with the immutable characteristics of race, color, or national origin. While governments are obliged to show respect to all people, they are not obliged to recognize and sanction any and every behavior and lifestyle choice.<br /><br />He also highlights the dangers of granted special rights based on sexual preference. He notes that vilification legislation and hate crime laws are increasingly including sexual orientation in the list of protected characteristics. This puts many groups at risk, especially religious bodies who should have the right to speak out on behaviors they regard as unwelcome.<br /><br />In the US the judiciary is in many cases penalizing and punishing those who simply wish to stand up for family and faith values. Churches and families are being forced to embrace a lifestyle that is at odds with their cherished beliefs.<br /><br />Staver rightly notes that this debate is the flash point of the culture wars. And the stakes are high. As the saying goes, the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. And many homosexual activists have been clear as to why they want marriage and adoption rights. As one lesbian put it, \\"Whoever captures the kids owns the future\\".<br /><br />This battle is about competing visions of the future, of society, of family and of gender. The consequences are thus pronounced indeed. Do we as a society put the wants of adults ahead of our children and the greater community? The truth is, there are many good reasons for societies to prefer heterosexual marriage.<br /><br />Staver closes by offering some ways forward. A Constitutional Amendment to guarantee marriage as between a man and a woman is one of the proposals. Other possibilities are canvassed. But as Staver notes, this is too important an issue to not get involved, or to put up the white flag. We owe it to our children to take a stand for marriage, and this book provides us with information to do just that..

US	52661388	R2LM35U5SRDQEB	156663606X	360894729	Fewer: How the New Demography of Depopulation Will Shape Our Future	Books	5	43	48	N	N	Population Implosion	World depopulation has become the most important, and alarming, new demographic trend to emerge in the past few decades. While the world has experienced low fertility rates before, they have been due to great social disruptions such as war, famine, depression or plague. But the rates always went up afterwards.<br /><br />Things are different now. The global downward trend in fertility is both long-term and pronounced. The numbers are alarming. There are now 63 nations with below-replacement fertility. The replacement level is a Total Fertility Rate of 2.1 children per women. Yet everywhere TFRs are plummeting. Today all 44 modern nations, with the exception of Albania, are below the 2.1 replacement level. America is just on that level.<br /><br />And consider this incredible statistic: European TFR has fallen for fifty consecutive years. Many European nations have a TFR of 1.2, such as Italy, Greece, and Austria. Spain's level is down to 1.1. The UN estimates that Europe's population of 728 million people today will shrink to 632 million within 50 years.<br /><br />The trend in the developing world is even more staggering. In 35 years the TFR there has fallen from 6.01 to around 2.8, and it continues to spiral downwards. South Korea, for example, has a TFR of just over 1.1, while China's rate is 1.8. This is down from 6.06 for China in the late 60s.<br /><br />Fertility rates are falling rapidly in Arab and Muslim nations as well. For example, forty years ago the TFR in North Africa was 7.1 children per woman. Today it is 3.2 and still falling.<br /><br />Now Wattenberg has written on these issues before. In 1987 he wrote The Birth Dearth. So why another book? What really shook up Wattenberg, and spurred on this newer book, was the fact that the UN made a major readjustment of its population projections in 2002. For decades prior to this date the UN had been predicting upward population trends for the developed world over the next half century.<br /><br />But in March 2002 it made a major revision of thinking on the trends in the developing world. Before this time it assumed that the TFR in the poor countries would fall to just 2.1 children per woman. It now changed that figure to 1.85, a full quarter of a child per woman. That meant that world population in the future would go down, not up. It is this new demographic that has really set off the alarm bells.<br /><br />Wattenberg gives us plenty of statistical information. And he points out that the US is one nation that seems to be bucking the trend. American TFR has actually risen lately, mainly due to immigration. But around the rest of the world the picture is bleak indeed.<br /><br />The causes are all the usual suspects: urbanisation, education, women in the workplace, contraception, abortion, etc. But the real question is, what will be the effect of this world-wide population implosion? We just do not know because it has never happened before, at least on such a large scale. How will economies fare? How will societies change?<br /><br />We do know that we are experiencing aging populations. But with a shrinking supply of babies, and therefore taxpayers, real crises are and will develop in simply meeting the needs of the growing elderly population. Who will pay for their pensions and medical care? These problems will be pronounced in all of the West, but especially in Europe and parts of Southeast Asia.<br /><br />Wattenberg looks at a number of implications of the New Demographics, including the geopolitical situation. Concerning the issue of freedom and democracy, the trends up until recently had looked grim. The free Western world (with the exception of America) was experiencing population decline. In the meantime, the non-democratic Muslim world was growing. Now most populations are in decline, include the Muslim world. With shrinking populations go declining defence budgets. America is the last remaining Western democracy that still has the numbers to sustain a viable defensive structure. In a world threatened by international terrorism, that defence capability is welcome indeed.<br /><br />But how things will progress in the future is an open question. For America to maintain its role as leader of the free world, it will have to keep its population levels up. Can immigration do this? As to immigration in general, he thinks this is mainly a healthy thing, and disagrees with those like Patrick Buchanan (The Death of the West), who describe it in worst-case scenario terms. In the short term America and the world should continue to benefit from immigration. The long term gets a bit unclear however.<br /><br />Wattenberg also looks at the issue of illegal immigration. In total, illegal immigrants make up only about 3 per cent of the US population. He thinks that overall their presence is not an overwhelming problem, with potential positives often out-weighing the negatives.<br /><br />He concludes by noting that the Less Developed Countries could in fact experience a \\"demographic dividend\\". He notes that poor countries with falling fertility rates are growing wealthier quicker than are the rich modern nations. In the meantime the New Demography is bad for most Western nations. Thus the need to spread the vision of freedom and democracy around the world, lest non- (or anti-) democratic nations win by default, by simply taking over due to sheer force of numbers.<br /><br />No one really knows where these trends will take us. Much of Wattenberg's book could be called speculative. But it is important that good minds pay close attention to these changes. This book is a very helpful contribution to that effort.rs to sustain a viable defensive structure.

Indeed, ethical erosion in science, with a corresponding abdication of social responsibility, seems to be inversely related to the chase for money. For many scientists, the pursuit of money has become the primary motivation, with concern for the moral and social good largely ignored.<br /><br />Science can be funded from governments, from industry, and from universities. Of course those who supply the cash flow can determine the type of research and in many respects the outcome of the research. One just has to think of the enormous budget given over to AIDS research, while other less glamorous (and less politically correct) diseases go begging for funding.<br /><br />The life sciences (medicine, biotechnology, pharmacology, etc.) is a good case in point. For example, pharmaceutical firms often misrepresent and inflate scientific data for regulatory approval, and to influence physicians to prescribe their products to an unwitting public. One way to achieve this end is to duplicate publication of experimental data to give the impression of widespread scientific backing.<br /><br />Greenberg offers other examples of bad ethics in human experimentation, and notes how the biomedical research community was aware of gross inadequacies in monitoring scientific experimentation and quite content to let the situation remain that way. The examples demonstrate that what is done in the name of science often seems to be above regulation, accountability and ethical review.<br /><br />And it is not just science that gets tainted with money and corporate influence, but knowledge as a whole. Thus corporate greed and the limitless pursuit of profit seem to negatively effect everyone within reach, and it is not scientific objectivity alone that suffers, but learning as well. No wonder why certain bioethical debates seems to be so one-sided. The recent stem cell debate is just one example where Big Biotech is buying its way into science and the media, regardless of the outcome for the rest of society.<br /><br />And Greenberg notes how the popular press acts mainly as a puppet of science, especially biomedical research. It routinely pumps out what is told to, without asking the hard questions it does of politicians and others. This is indeed the case with reports of scientific-medical progress. Greenberg calls this \\"may\\" journalism. Stem cells may do this. Cloning may do that. Gene therapy may deliver the goods. We are wowed by reports of potential medical breakthroughs, but they are just that: potential. However, the way the media presents them, it seems like a cure for Parkinson's disease will arrive next week. Thus we find a collusion between certain scientists, various industries (eg., the Biotech industry), and a gullible and/or subservient media.<br /><br />And of course this collusion acts as a giant feed-back loop. Journalists need good news stories, and scientists and the corporations need people to think they are just on the verge of a major medical breakthrough, if only a bit more funding were forthcoming. The one feeds of the other, and a disease-weary public, believing that immortality is just around the corner, will go along with it. And governments also get into the act, claiming that if we over-regulate things like cloning or stem cell research, all the research will move interstate or overseas, leaving them behind. So there is a grand mingling of state, corporate and public interests taking place, making it even harder for science to claim any sort of neutrality and objectivity.<br /><br />If religious leaders and politicians today are subject to intense scrutiny and ethical appraisal (and rightly so), then perhaps it is time to extend the same treatment to scientists. And one place to begin is by reading this important and timely book.begin is by reading this important and timely book. <br />	2005-02-05

One of the most incisive examinations of the problem of fatherless families is Fatherless America.<br /><br />The book is based on a wealth of statistical information, highlighting the dangerous trend of family disintegration in America.  Perhaps most disturbing of the information he uncovers is the fact that \\"tonight, about 40 per cent of American children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live\\".  \\"Fatherlessness,\\" argues Blankenhorn, \\"is the most harmful demographic trend of this generation\\".  The primary results of this trend are \\"a decline in children's well-being and a rise in male violence, especially against women.\\"<br /><br />The problem is not just that of the absence of fathers, but \\"the absence of our belief in fathers.\\"  Recalling the findings of Margaret Mead and others that the supreme test of any civilisation is whether it can socialise men by teaching them to be fathers, Blankenhorn traces the disappearance of the idea of fatherhood in contemporary culture, and the effects this has on our children and our society<br /><br />While he acknowledges that the so-called traditional family was not without problems, he sees the move to a fatherless society as a far greater dilemma.  As fatherhood becomes devalued, decultured and deinstitutionalised, the problems associated with inner city America will only compound themselves.  We now know without question that the overwhelming generator of violence among young men is the fatherless family.  There are now a multitude of studies available which make it perfectly clear that fatherlessness is the major factor in crime, more than race, poverty or any other social variable.<br /><br />Paternal absenteeism and the erosion of marriage effect every aspect of life.  For example, we now know, contrary to feminist doctrine, that domestic violence is much more likely to occur in homes where the partners are not married.  A woman is much more likely to abused by a boyfriend, a de facto or a live in than by a husband.  The same is true of child sexual abuse.  \\"What magnifies the risk of sexual abuse in children is not the presence of a married father but his absence.\\"  Again, a host of studies have clearly established this point.<br /><br />With all these studies confirming the importance of marriage and the presence of fathers, one would hope that our political leaders would be reaffirming our national commitment to marriage.  The opposite is the case unfortunately. American society is not intent on making sure marriage works, nor is it intent on making divorce less easy to obtain.  Instead, it is in the process of deinstitutionalising marriage and fatherhood.  It has become a culture of divorce.  Instead of trying to reduce divorce, it seeks to make the process more cooperative and amicable.  Divorce reform means simply trying to involve fewer lawyers and more mediators.  This may be better than conflict and litigation, but it does not deal with the real problem.<br /><br />When anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski said that \\"the father is indispensable for the full sociological status of the child as well as of its mother,\\" he was stating a truth that is both simple and profound. Yet we live in a day where simplicity is spurned and profundity is not grasped. As C.S. Lewis once said, \\"The process of living seems to consist in coming to realise truths so ancient and simple that, if stated, they sound like barren platitudes.\\"<br /><br />That children need mother and father, and that healthy families are a prerequisite for healthy societies, have been historical givens. Such claims now however are regarded with disbelief. The case for fatherhood and marriage needs to be remade for a sceptical age.  Blankenhorn's book is a valuable component in that argument.at domestic violence is much more likely to occur in homes where the partners are not married.  A woman is much more likely to abused by a boyfriend, a de facto or a live in than by a husband.  The same is true of child sexual abuse.  \\"What magnifies the risk of sexual abuse in children is not the presence of a married father but his absence.\\"  Again, a host of studies have clearly established this point. <br /> <br />With all these studies confirming the importance of marriage and the presence of fathers, one would hope that our political leaders would be reaffirming our national commitment to marriage.  The opposite is the case unfortunately. American society is not intent on making sure marriage works, nor is it intent on making divorce less easy to obtain.  Instead, it is in the process of deinstitutionalising marriage and fatherhood.  It has become a culture of divorce.  Instead of trying to reduce divorce, it seeks to make the process more cooperative and amicable.  Divorce reform means simply trying to involve fewer lawyers and more mediators.  This may be better than conflict and litigation, but it does not deal with the real problem. <br /> <br />When anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski said that \\"the father is indispensable for the full sociological status of the child as well as of its mother,\\" he was stating a truth that is both simple and profound. Yet we live in a day where simplicity is spurned and profundity is not grasped. As C.S. Lewis once said, \\"The process of living seems to consist in coming to realise truths so ancient and simple that, if stated, they sound like barren platitudes.\\" <br /> <br />That children need mother and father, and that healthy families are a prerequisite for healthy societies, have been historical givens. Such claims now however are regarded with disbelief. The case for fatherhood and marriage needs to be remade for a sceptical age.  Blankenhorn's book is a valuable component in that argument. <br />	2005-02-05

Huxley was \\"Darwin's bulldog\\" just over a century ago, surely Richard Dawkins would be Darwin's pit bull terrier today. A leading proponent of neo-Darwinism, Dawkins is just as famous for his aggressive, almost obsessive, promotion of atheism. His many well-written books and articles have made him a formidable proponent of both Darwinian theory and secular humanism.<br /><br />Yet to date no book-length critique of Dawkins has appeared from a biblical point of view. Until now that is. The just-released Dawkins' God is an important assessment and critique of Dawkins and his crusade against religion. While McGrath respects and admires Dawkins when he sticks to the realm of science, it is when Dawkins wanders out of the domain of science, attacking religion in the name of science, that McGrath shows his very real shortcomings.<br /><br />Thus this book is not so much a critique of Darwinism as a critique of philosophy and ideology masquerading as science. Dawkins should know as well as anyone that science has limits, and questions of God's existence do not fall within those limits. Yet the works of Dawkins are permeated with emotive and irrational attacks on faith and religion. This misuse and abuse of science by Dawkins in this regard is a major theme of this volume.<br /><br />McGrath begins by analysing Dawkins' work on genes. For Dawkins, genes are everything, or at least they can account for everything. Thus Dawkins takes neo-Darwinism as an explanation of observable natural phenomena, and elevates it to a worldview, an all-embracing metanarrative. Again, he takes science where it was never meant to go.<br /><br />McGrath analyses this further in the false disjunction Dawkins time and again sets up: one either lives by blind faith or the facts and evidence of science. Take you pick, it is one or the other. Of course he misrepresents both. No reputable Christian thinker has ever identified religious belief as mere blind faith. Faith is grounded on evidence, and Christianity offers a fair amount of evidence for its truth claims.<br /><br />And science is far from the neutral, totally objective scenario that Dawkins paints. It deals with evidence and observations, yes, but also deals in probabilities as much as in certainties. The constant revision and overturning of scientific theories means that scientists should remain humble, not arrogant. So too of course should Christians, who need to continually refine and clarify their theological convictions. Both involve elements of faith and reason. Both should be approached with care and humility.<br /><br />The replicators of ideas and beliefs - what Dawkins calls memes - the cultural equivalent of genes, are also critiqued by McGrath. The truth is, they are not the fruit of scientific discovery but philosophical postulation. Dawkins says people believe in God, not because he exists, but because of God memes. The idea of God, says Dawkins, like a virus, is passed along and replicated in culture, just as physical traits (in the form of DNA) are passed along by means of genes.<br /><br />But as McGrath rightly points out, is this God meme concept just another meme, another virus, another false belief being passed along? And if there is a God meme, could there not be an atheist meme as well? The fact is, Dawkins has a philosophical precommitment to atheism, and he tries to smuggle this belief system in while piggy-backing of Darwinism. But as McGrath establishes, Darwinism does not necessarily entail atheism. Nor does it necessarily entail theism for that matter.<br /><br />Science in general and evolutionary biology in particular can neither prove nor disprove the existence of God. Such questions lie outside of the purview of science. But Dawkins' hatred of religion leads him to blur the boundaries of where science leaves off and other disciplines (theology, philosophy) begin.<br /><br />What one makes of Darwinism is a matter of scientific debate. The evidence can be weighedand considered. But it is simply inappropriate for scientists to wade into debates about God's existence or non-existence by means of the scientific method. It is inadequate for such a debate. And it is disingenuous for those who have a beef against religion to seek to use the scientific method to do their dirty work.<br /><br />Those wanting an attack on Darwinism will not find it here. The work of the Intelligent Design movement, for example, is not even mentioned in this volume. Yet ID has landed some telling blows on an already shaky evolutionary edifice.<br /><br />But this volume does do a good job of demonstrating the proper limits of genuine science, and the very poor intellectual armaments Dawkins brings to bear against faith and religion.

American author Kay Hymowitz is painfully aware that raising children today is a difficult task at the best of times. Children today are exposed to all sorts of pressures and temptations that many of us never had to worry about.<br /><br />Much of the current wisdom as to how children should develop and how moms and dads should parent is simply wrong advice, argues Hymowitz. Today's children may be richer, better educated and healthier than any other generation, but many are emotionally, morally and spiritually deprived. We have pampered our children, spoiled our children, and immersed them in all the toys, gadgets and fashion they can stand, but most are still ill-equipped to face adulthood.<br /><br />The proper moral and intellectual training of our children is giving way to trendy socialisation and the impoverishing effects of popular culture. These chapters highlight some of these disturbing trends, and demonstrate how our children are suffering as a result.<br /><br />The opening chapter takes head on the day care establishment, and the myths surrounding it. Hymowitz documents how the feminist script is harming our children. Get a career, moms are told, and let the day care centres look after the kids. It will be good for them. But the research points in the opposite direction. The younger kids are, and the more time they spend in day care, the worse they fare. But a feminist-dominated media and a child-unfriendly culture seeks to cover up these truths, and make women feel guilty, not for abandoning their children, but for letting their maternal instincts tell them otherwise.<br /><br />No matter how high the quality of day care, nothing can replace mother love and father love. Yet we are letting a whole generation of our children be raised by strangers. By putting adult achievements and careers ahead of the interests of our children, we are short-changing the next generation and undermining our societies.<br /><br />A chapter on tweens also makes for chilling reading. Children between eight and twelve are effectively being robbed of their childhood and preadolescence. They are being forced to become teenagers prematurely. Much of this is due to the tremendous pressure of popular culture, advertising, consumerism and mass marketting.<br /><br />Kids today are heavily targeted by the corporate world, urged to get the \\"look\\" and all that goes with it. The worst thing for a tween today is not to be cool. And the ones who make a financial killing off our kids (and their parents) are determining what is cool.<br /><br />Thus every ten-year-old wants the look, even though it may mean forcing young girls to look like prostitutes. Cosmetics companies, clothing manufacturers, the music industry and fast-food conglomerates all conspire against our children, promoting shameless hedonism and individualism. The hooker look is in, and common values and decency are out.<br /><br />As a result, tweens are demonstrating many of the deviant behaviours usually associated with teenagers and adults. Drug and alcohol abuse, crime, eating disorders, and precocious sexual activity are all becoming much more common among our preadolescents.<br /><br />Of course with more and more single-parent households and more and more two-income families, kids are left to their own devices, and the corporate world is happy to cash in on this, to become substitute parents with substitute values and agendas. Absent parents, powerful peer pressure, and a greedy and rapacious corporate culture makes for a bad mix. Kids as a result are growing up in a moral and spiritual wasteland.<br /><br />Other perceptive chapters on topics such as schooling, Sesame Street, and discipline, add to the gloomy picture of being a child in a postmodern world. But in order to help our children we first need to understand the strifethey are in. This book should help focus our minds on one of the most urgent needs any society can be engaged in: making sure the next generation has a proper foundation in which to enter into adulthood and become helpful and productive citizens.<br /><br />Unless we do right by our kids, society will be left with shaky foundations indeed. And if we do not prepare our children for what lies ahead, we ensure that society will be in much worse shape in the future. For the sake of what lies ahead, we need to get this right. This book helps to alert us to the dangers we face, and the changes we need to make if we are to be confident about tomorrow.understand the strife they are in.

In it he brings up to date recent developments in the euthanasia wars. But the same concern for where society is heading, and the same call for action is found in this volume.<br /><br />Smith argues that modern medicine is undergoing a seismic shift, as is that of the surrounding culture. Whereas societies and their medical practitioners once believed that saving life and protecting life was our highest and most noble calling, they have now come to see that killing in the name of compassion is both justified and necessary.<br /><br />What has brought about such a radical shift in values and priorities? Smith argues that a number of inter-related causes can be mentioned. There is the \\"moral Balkanization\\" of Western culture, with a loss in moral absolutes and religious convictions. Then there is the elevation of personal autonomy as the highest virtue.<br /><br />Also there is a very sophisticated political machine pushing the euthanasia agenda. Backed with big bucks and extensive marketing research, it has become adept at selling euthanasia. With plenty of euphemisms, misinformation and scare tactics, it is managing to convince many that death is desirable, and life is not.<br /><br />And then there is the bottom line of money. The huge blowout in medical costs for the elderly makes the euthanasia alternative seem very tempting indeed. It is a major savings to bump off the elderly instead of treating them.<br /><br />The hazards of legalizing euthanasia are many. Suffering would increase, not decrease. For example, the funding and research on problems like AIDS could easily be cut, with the idea that it would be better for these people simply to die. Pain relief, hospice work, and palliative care would also face major cutbacks and social undermining. Why bother, after all, when a quick lethal injection would be much cheaper and easier?<br /><br />Smith examines some of the recent decisions made concerning end of life care, noting a slippery slope in action. In March of 1986 an ethical advisory panel of the American Medical Association declared that food and fluids provided by feeding tubes were no longer to be considered basic humane care, but medical treatment, and could therefore be withheld. Previously hydration and nutrition, even by means of tubes, were considered to be mandatory and necessary care.<br /><br />This led to another momentous decision in 1994, when the AMA declared that foods and fluids could be withdrawn even if a patient was not terminally ill nor permanently unconscious, something that before was a requirement.<br /><br />Smith points out that such steps along a slippery slope are not new, with  a very similar incremental approach occurring in Germany early last century, leading to the final solution of the Nazis. A 1920 book written by two German professors, Permitting the Destruction of Life Not Worth Life became the cornerstone of Nazi practice which saw 200,000 helpless people deliberated killed by German doctors and nurses between 1939 and 1945.<br /><br />The Dutch experience with euthanasia is another example of the slippery slope. First terminally ill patients were allowed to be killed. Then came the chronically ill, then the depressed, then even children. Once you accept the legalised killing of a patient is allowable, soon any and every sort of patient will become a candidate for the lethal injection. And the euthanasia virus is contagious. Belgium, a southern neighbor of Holland, also legalised euthanasia in 2002, making it the second nation in the world to do so.<br /><br />The details Smith provides of the Dutch experience make for chilling reading, but they act as a sober warning to other nations. Prior to 1960 there was no push for euthanasia in Holland. But the 60s cultural revolution unleashed a host of liberalising trends, in many fields, be it sex, drugs, or the life issues.<br /><br />A 1973 case saw the quasi-legalisationof euthanasia there. In 1993 guidelines were issued. But as Smith shows, these guidelines were a chimera, and euthanasia simply got out of hand. The guidelines were meant to keep euthanasia rare, only for the hard cases. But over time doctors interpreted loosely the guidelines, pushed the boundaries, and in effect ignored their intent.<br /><br />Various reports have documented this slippery slope. The 1991 Remmelink Report found that nearly 9 per cent of all deaths in Holland were due to deliberate actions of doctors. And half of those were involuntary. And a 1996 study found that half of Dutch physicians took the initiative by suggesting euthanasia to their patients. Other research has found that it is usually families, not patients, who push for euthanasia. And a 1997 report found that doctors kill 8 per cent of all infants who die each year. And some 300 infants die each year because of medical neglect.<br /><br />Teens suffering depression are also being bumped off. The list goes on and on. The Dutch experiment proves that once the door is opened, it does not close but simply gets pushed open even wider.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, this volume makes for a worrying read. The trends in different parts of the world described here show us that we in the West have abandoned our respect for life, and have embraced the culture of death. Smith closes by noting that we have two options: we can choose the option of care and inclusion, or the option of death and exclusion.

When he started digging into the truth claims of Christianity, he found the evidence compelling, and became a believer. His investigation into the reliability and truthfulness of the Christian faith became the basis of a best-selling volume, The Case for Christ.<br /><br />Another volume, The Case for Faith, soon followed. Between the two volumes, most of the major areas of biblical faith, and the challenges they face, are addressed. Thus meaty chapters on the possibility of miracles, the problem of evil, the historicity of the resurrection, the reliability of the gospels, the relationship between science and faith, among others, are presented.<br /><br />In this third volume, another area of potential difficulty is discussed: the whole debate between creation and evolution in particular, and the biblical worldview versus philosophical naturalism in general. As in the previous volumes, Strobel interviews a number of experts and authorities in relevant fields, and asks hard-hitting questions as to whether biblical faith can stand up to the tough issues of the day.<br /><br />In this volume he explores the findings of modern science, the theories of Darwin and the neo-Darwinists, and the philosophy of science, in an attempt to see if the claims of Scripture can face up to them. A number of objections raised by science or evolution are examined in detail. The evidence, Strobel demonstrates, points us to God, not away. Indeed, taken together, there is a cumulative case for faith in God, as the various sciences are examined in depth.<br /><br />Consider the evidence of physics. Physicists know that the universe seems to be finely tuned for life to exist. Just the right conditions seem to exist to make life possible and sustainable. There are so many finely tuned conditions in place that chance does not seem capable of providing a satisfactory explanation. Random accidents cannot explain the precisely set dials of the universe.<br /><br />The evidence from cosmology is also impressive. How could our universe suddenly spring into existence? How is it possible to get something from nothing? For a long time science had assumed an eternal material universe. But by the twentieth century, science came to see that the universe in fact had a beginning. Einstein's Theory of Relativity did not allow for a static universe, and the rise of the Big Bang model has shown a clear case for a beginning point.<br /><br />And the Big Bang model shows that our universe depends on highly specialised conditions, that makes it seem designed, not accidental. Again, there seems to be a case of fine tuning going on, something presupposing a fine tuner.<br /><br />Astronomy also bears witness to a creator. Here again we find an example of fine tuning, with a series of extraordinary \\"coincidences\\" that seem to rule out the possibility of accident. The earth seems uniquely suited to support human life, and too many conditions must be met for this to be so, thus making the designer thesis seem quite credible.<br /><br />A habitable planet is hard to come by. It requires a lot of special preconditions. And astronomers have yet to find another part of the universe that seems to fully display these necessary conditions. The more astronomers learn about the universe, the more unique planet earth becomes. Our sun for example displays unique features all of which make a habitable earth possible. It has just the right composition, orbit, mass, light, distance and location for life on earth to flourish.<br /><br />Or consider the area of biochemistry. The more we discover in this field, the more we see intelligent design at work. Biochemists like Michael Behe have shown that at the most basic levels of life there is irreducible complexity. That is, a number of different components must be acting in concert to produce a desired effect. One part cannot slowly evolve and join with another. All must be operating simultaneously from the beginning. And life at the most simple levels demonstrates this feature time and again.<br /><br />Just as in a mousetrap, all the parts must be there and operating together, so in life, we see this amazing complexity of function. Evolution cannot account for how such irreducible complexity could ever have arisen. Life, it turns out, is based on all sorts of complex molecular machines. These machines could never work if parts slowly evolved and were added to the overall mechanism. They must be present from day one to work. So incremental Darwinism just does not explain these things. Naturalism just cannot explain these complex biological systems, but intelligent design seems to.<br /><br />On and on goes the evidence. I have only given brief overview. The scientists and philosophers and others interviewed here give quite complex and detailed arguments about all these points. The evidence seems to keep weighing up in favor of some kind of intelligent design, and away from a naturalistic, Darwinian explanation.<br /><br />Taken together, the various strands of information make for a strong cumulative case for a creator. The alternative explanations become more far-fetched as we learn more about the amazing world that we live in. It requires as much faith to believe some of the claims put forward by naturalistic Darwinism than those put forward by the intelligent design movement. Open minds will weigh up the evidence for themselves and see where it takes them. This volume is a good place to begin in that search.ll must be operating simultaneously from the beginning.

Certainly the 21st century will be known as the century of biotechnology. Whether genetic engineering, designer babies, human cloning, stem cell research or nanotechnology, the advances in this field will continue apace. But so too will the ethical concerns.<br /><br />Indeed, what it means to be human, what it is to be a person, and questions of human worth and dignity are all raised in the light of these new technologies. While perhaps all of the technologies are being championed as means to a better human end, many more cautious minds are expressing concerns about the potential for dehumanisation and a cavalier attitude toward life. Very real concerns about the state of personhood and the uniqueness of human life are engendered by the new biotech.<br /><br />Clear ethical and social understanding of where the new technologies are taking us is thus the order of the day, and the editors of this book are well-suited to the task. They have both been at the forefront of ethical and theological reflection on the direction of the new biotech revolution. Charles Colson has long championed the need for a biblical worldview to assess where western society is heading, and Cameron is a leading bioethicist who has been dealing in these issues for quite some time now. His important volume The New Medicine, penned back in 1991, was one of the early wake-up calls as to where the new medical technologies were taking us.<br /><br />In this volume we have twelve essays written by experts in the field, experts such as David Prentice, Richard Doerflinger, Wesley Smith and William Saunders. They all offer relevant expertise in the areas of medicine, genetics, the new reproductive technologies, and biotechnology. But they also combine with that expertise the necessary moral, theological and philosophical framework by which to judge these new advances.<br /><br />Cameron's opening chapter sets the stage, reminding us that it is not just such fields as embryology and genetics that we need to be up on, but anthropology as well. That is, we need to see the bigger picture of what it is to be human. The authors here all approach their anthropology by way of the Judeo-Christian worldview.<br /><br />Cameron discusses three developments in the field of bioethics. In the first period, discussion centered on whether and when we should take life, as in the abortion and euthanasia debates. During the second period, the debate was on the making of human life, as in IVF. The most recent period has focused on the manipulation and manufacture of life, as in robotics and nanotechnology. Cameron says this progression really entails talk of taking life to making life to faking life. Not a bad summary of the way biotech has been evolving.<br /><br />Cameron urges a two-pronged strategy for dealing with these trends. One, a strong pro-life paradigm must be articulated. Two, working alliances with more politically progressive groups may be needed if we wish to stem the tide of runaway Big Biotech.<br /><br />The other authors also provide stimulating and informative offerings. Most of the big ethical question get a lengthy hearing. When does life begin? Are there limits to science and technology? Who owns our genes? Will a clone have a soul? Are we witnessing a new eugenics? These and related questions are more than adequately covered in this comprehensive and incisive volume.<br /><br />The meaty chapters in this book focus on a number of the new biotech developments, but all with a view to maintaining human dignity and value. With science and technology fast outstripping our moral and social reflection on them, a book like this a vitally needed to help us think critically, ethically and in an informed manner. Thus this volume deserves a very wide reading indeed.dvances. <br /> <br />Cameron's opening chapter sets the stage, reminding us that it is not just such fields as embryology and genetics that we need to be up on, but anthropology as well.

But this book comes pretty close to doing just that. Written by a journalist and researcher who has been following the issue for over a decade now, Bioevolution is a very readable and helpful look at a whole range of new developments in the world of biotechnology.<br /><br />Pretty much all the hot topics are covered here, including gene therapy, stem cell research, genetically modified foods, the Human Genome Project, xenotransplantation, cloning, biopesticides and designer babies.<br /><br />Given the nature of such topics, it is helpful to discover where an author stands on several fronts. Concerning the debate over whether the new technologies are good or bad, Fumento would side with the optimists, arguing that while the new biotech industry is not without its perils and downside, the advantages nonetheless outweigh the disadvantages. Thus he is no Luddite, but neither is he a techno-utopian. He simply believes much of the developments are good, and good for us.<br /><br />This reviewer would argue that he perhaps errs too much on the side of optimism and confidence in where this revolution is taking us.  It seems that there are always a number of lurking dangers, including the risk that vested interests may call the shots.  Whether in the form of Big Biotech putting profit ahead of principle, or simply in placing too much faith in science and technology, one can easily get carried away with the adrenalin rush of discovery and progress, while failing to see the ethical and social implications.<br /><br />A second way of sizing up this book and the author's perspective is also quite important. Many of the new technologies directly impinge upon questions of life, death and personhood. In the issue of embryonic stem cell research, for example, stem cells can only be extracted from a week old embryo, something many, including this reviewer, consider to be the very early stages of human life, and therefore should not be sacrificed for the possible good of others.<br /><br />In this debate Fumento is not necessarily in the pro-life camp, but neither is he unaware of the concerns. Indeed, he regards abortion as a \\"moral  dilemma that swamps any ethical problem I can even conceive of regarding biotech\\". This, his only direct mention of abortion, is in fact one of the few times in the book that he does wade into ethical considerations.<br /><br />Having said that, perhaps one of the strongest chapters in the book, at least from a pro-life point of view, is his chapter on stem cells. Here his investigative journalism skills and his unwillingness to be bluffed by a biased media shine through. He rightly points out that the general public is often unaware that there are in fact two sources of stem cells: one's own body, and new embryos. He illustrates how some in the biotech world, along with a sympathetic media, are largely responsible for this public confusion.<br /><br />The truth is we have no success with embryonic stem cells to date, while many hundreds of human cures have been obtained from adult stem cells. And the latter do not involve any ethical dilemmas, as the former do. Fumento does a good job of looking at the politics behind this debate, and how the issue is so easily distorted and misreported.<br /><br />Fumento ends his book by declaring that the future of biotechnolgy is \\"bright indeed\\". It may be. But it is also possible that the warnings of Brave New World or 1984 may still be the more accurate way in which history plays itself out in the years ahead. If even half of the somewhat rosy scenarios painted in this volume do eventuate, then there may be some real hope indeed. But if Fumento has erred on the side of being overly optimistic, then troubled days may lie ahead. But wherever the new biotechnologies lead us, this volume does a very good job of unpacking the science, the promise, and the possibilities of the way ahead.the possibilities of the way ahead. <br />	2004-11-24

Although this volume describes the American scene, it would be true of most other Western nations as well. Young people have been sold a bill of goods regarding sexuality, and they are paying the penalty, big time.<br /><br />Consider some of the statistics: In the US in 2002 up to one quarter of sexually active teens were living with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Each year over 15 million Americans will contract a new STD. Around a fifth of these will be teenagers. Indeed, while teens make up just 10 percent of the population, they account for 25 per cent of all STDs.<br /><br />The truth is, the sexual revolution of the 60s has unleashed an untamed monster. When I was growing up one seldom heard of venereal diseases, as they were then called. And there were really only two: syphilis and gonorrhoea. And they tended to be something people other than sailors and prostitutes never worried about. Today there are at least 50 STDs. And with multiple strains of mutating viruses, that actual number may be as high as 100.<br /><br />Thus a whole new batch of STDs have emerged in line with the no-holds-barred sexual revolution. Chlamydia for example was not even identified until 1976. Thus we have a whole new vocabulary as part of our dictionaries, with disease like genital herpes, HPV, HIV, and a range of new viral infections.<br /><br />And the problem is many of these diseases are at present incurable (like HIV) and many are asymptomatic (that is one often does not even know one has the infection). And many are quite infectious, easily spread, and hard to control. Herpes for example lives on the skin and is easily passed on.<br /><br />While antibiotics can stop bacterial STDs (like chlamydia) they cannot stop viruses. And even the bacteria are hard to control, with many mutating into more devious germs, becoming resistant to antibiotics.<br /><br />Doctor Meegan does not just warn against the physical dangers of casual sex. She also speaks to the emotional, psychological and social harms. The safe sex myth (just use a condom, etc) is not only physically harmful, as most contraceptives are far from foolproof, but the risks of a broken promise, a broken relationship, and a broken heart cannot be protected by the condom culture.<br /><br />Dr Meeker reminds us that teens are especially vulnerable to negative emotional and psychological side effects due to early sexual activity. And that translates into an epidemic of teen depression and suicide. And the problem compounds itself. Depressed kids in turn are more likely to turn to sex, as many turn to drugs, to deal with their grief.<br /><br />Losing one's virginity at an early age often leads to a loss in self respect and self worth. A loss of trust and expectation also is part of the downside. The innocence of childhood is ripped away and replaced with a premature burden of adulthood.<br /><br />The truth is, the condom culture and the explosion in comprehensive sex education have not helped matters, but made them worse. We have never before had so much sex ed, and we have never before had so much teen sexuality, abortion and STDs. There seems to be a clear correlation between the two.<br /><br />And a major missing ingredient in most sex ed courses is what teens really need to hear: how to say no to sexual pressure. Abstinence before marriage and faithfulness in marriage is the only guaranteed safe sex. Yet this message is seldom being taught to our young people. It certainly is not the message of popular culture.<br /><br />Critics will simply shrug off this volume and accuse the author of scare mongering. But try telling that to a young person who is now permanently affected by an STD. Try telling that to a young girl whose future is in doubt because sexual experimentation has lead to an unwanted pregnancy. Try telling that to those who have become infertile due to promiscuous sexual activity.<br /><br />The consequences of the sexual revolution are very real indeed. It is time we had some straight talk on the many dangers of, and downsides to, teenage sex. The good news is we are not animals and we can control our desires. But when all around us are telling our young people that they should just go for it, the message of sexual responsibility is easily drowned out. Thus the importance of this book.become infertile due to promiscuous sexual activity. <br /> <br />The consequences of the sexual revolution are very real indeed.

This volume examines the various undercurrents in the Muslim world today, and how a divided Islam is seeking to interact with the rest of the world. Arab unity, Lewis demonstrates, is now an oxymoron. Today no single Muslim polity exists, and this is part of the problem, or identity crisis, which the Islamic world faces.<br /><br />For many centuries there was one Islamic community united by one ruler. Even when that community splintered into various states, there was still a discernable unified polity. No longer however. It is this divided and amorphous body, with the loss of a coherent center, that is now seeking to find its way in the modern world.  Resentment, disorientation and despair have been part of the reaction.<br /><br />Of course Islam is more than just a religion, it is a culture and civilization as well. As part of his historical examination, Lewis compares the Islamic and Christian civilizations. In many ways they are sister civilizations, he argues<br /><br />They certainly have much more in common with each other than with the major eastern religious traditions. And of course both share common ancestry with Judaism. And both appeal to divine revelation and a divine law-giver.<br /><br />But there are major differences as well. This is especially apparent in the relationship between religion, society and the state. They are clearly separate - or at least should be - in Christianity. But no such distinction exists in Islam. Church and state relations, so much of an issue of debate in Western Christian nations is not even an issue in Islam. The Muslim world is at once both a religious and a political sphere. One can choose between God and Caesar in Christianity. Both are one and the same in Islam.<br /><br />And of course Islam responded to modernity in a much different manner than did Christianity. In fact, it can be said that it was Christian civilization that gave birth to modernism, and it has in many ways accepted its offspring. Islam on the other hand did not - perhaps could not - give rise to such a development, and even if it did, [...]<br /><br />With the differing reactions to modernism in mind, Lewis examines the various responses to the crisis in Islam that has followed, with extensive discussion of one of the more frightening options, that of terrorism.<br /><br />The rise of Islamic extremism is examined in detail, with helpful comparisons made of other forms of militancy, including the Christian Crusades. While some may seek to argue that the major monotheistic religions are the same in terms of the use of force, Lewis demonstrates some obvious differences.<br /><br />He makes clear that while there has always been a history of armed conquest in Islam, Christian use of arms is both tangential and unjustified in terms of its own faith and its propagation. Indeed, while there are some similarities between the histories of Christian and Islamic civilization, this is an area of major difference. Jihad is a religious obligation in Islam, while the Crusades were a late, limited and [...]<br /><br />While the concept of jihad can also be understood in a more general sense as a religious striving, from its inception it also had a military connotation. And throughout Islamic history, jihad has mainly been understood to mean armed struggle.<br /><br />True, both Islam and Christianity have a concept of just war theory, but differences nonetheless exist. For example, much of Islam's wars were fought against the followers of other faiths. Christian battles tended to be in-house, against those seen as heretical and schismatic.<br /><br />And to the modern Muslim terrorists at least, there is no such thing as collateral damage. Uninvolved civilians are a prime target. This is a major means of inspiring fear and winning psychological victory, along with gaining publicity. Christianity eschews such practices in principle, although Islam is not alone in resorting to such means. European terrorist organizations also spring to mind.<br /><br />Moreover, there is in Islam no instruction to turn the other cheek, nor an expectation of swords being beaten into plowshares. In addition, there is the theory and [...] which is foreign to Christianity. It arose at an early period in Islam's history, and of course we get the term from a Muslim sect dating from the eleventh century.<br /><br />Lewis makes it clear however that the bulk of Muslims are neither fundamentalists nor terrorists, and have little sympathy for their cause. And he leaves open the question as to which way the majority of Muslims will go. If they follow the path of groups like Al Qaida, then the future looks grim indeed. But if the majority pursue a better, more peaceful option, then there are hopeful prospects ahead.<br /><br />But Lewis is realistic on this. He reminds us that of the 57 member states of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, only one, Turkey, has had any history of length of democratic institutions. The only other two at the moment who might move in this direction are Iran and Iraq.<br /><br />And he rightly notes that the war against terror and the struggle for freedom are closely related. Fostering pro-democracy reforms in the Middle East will be difficult and painstakingly slow. But they are possible and must be pursued with the same rigor that we use in combating terrorism.<br /><br />In sum, this book is both realistic in its appraisal of recent Muslim history, but sensitive to distinctions, and hopeful of a better future than what we have recently been through.ations also spring to mind.

US	52661388	R151HNNHZB2GJJ	1893554309	643613111	The Long March: How the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s Changed America	Books	5	17	19	N	N	What the 60s have wrought	As a radical of the 60s, who has since moved on, this volume was a pleasure to read.<br /><br />The book traces the story of how the 60s cultural revolution happened and why. It examines in some detail the \\"long march through the institutions\\" which the radicals took. The phrase, attributed to the Italian Marxist Gramsci, speaks of the need to overthrow societies from within, instead of relying on bloody revolutions from without. The strategy, laments Kimball, had been all too effective.<br /><br />Indeed, no one could have foreseen how quickly and easily the institutions did crumble before the radical activists. The moral, cultural and social blitzkrieg has been as thorough as it has been all-consuming. And the success of this revolution, Kimball reminds, \\"can be measured not in toppled governments but in shattered values\\".<br /><br />Values of every kind have been thrown to the wind in this far-reaching revolution. Religious values, cultural values, moral values and social values have all been deeply effected, making this one of the most thorough and successful revolutions to date.<br /><br />Kimball begins his study with leading figures from the 50s such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs. He reminds us that although these characters are idolised by many today, they in fact sought to glorify \\"madness, drug abuse, criminality, and excess\\". Not a great footing for the next generation to build upon. But that is exactly what transpired.<br /><br />Social and cultural nihilism became a hallmark of the hippy generation, with plentiful servings of sex, drugs and rock and roll defining the movement. But it is not just the hedonism and decadence of the 60s that Kimball highlights, but the leading intellectual movers and shakers that undergirded it.<br /><br />A whole chapter is therefore devoted to leftist novelist Norman Mailer. Susan Sontag, the leftwing feminist and intellectual also gets a whole chapter, as does Charles Reich and his The Greening of America, LSD guru Timothy Leary, and one time Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver. Norman O. Brown, Herbert Marcuse and Paul Goodman, among others, are also covered.<br /><br />In an intriguing chapter entitled \\"The Liberal Capitulation\\" Kimball recounts the days of the violent campus protests. Beginning with the Free Speech Movement at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964, he recounts how the campus takeovers and violence spread around the nation. Kimball notes that the radical demands of the university activists were matched by the pathetic surrender of the campus chiefs. Heads of most universities quickly caved in to the demands of the radicals, and the political correctness run amok today is the direct result of this capitulation.<br /><br />Thus higher education in the US today is mainly about promoting radical political agendas and ideologies, and has very little to do with the idea of the unbiased pursuit of truth and knowledge. (Kimball of course has explored this them in much more detail in his 1990 study, Tenured Radicals: How Politics Has Corrupted Our Higher Education.)<br /><br />Kimball also covers other usual suspects in the cultural revolution: Tom Hayden, Bobby Seale, William Kunstler, Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Daniel Berrigan, William Sloane Coffin, and Rap Brown. He notes that most of these radicals were products of the bourgeois, capitalist system: \\"Whatever else it was, the long march of America's cultural revolution was a capitalist, bourgeois revolution: a revolution of the privileged, by the privileged, and for the privileged.\\"<br /><br />Kimball concludes by asking where such activists can be found today. The lack of campus activism and social radicalism is mainly due to the success of the 60s revolution. The truth is, \\"there is little that the radicals demanded that they did not get.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately the book ends with no proposals as to how to turn things around. He carefully analyses how the culture war succeeded, but offers no real advice for the way ahead. He does seem to want to eschew complete despair and surrender. He rejects, for example, the advice of culture-warrior Paul Weyrich. In a famous open letter to his friends and supporters in 1999, Weyrich basically raised the white flag, saying we had lost big time, and that perhaps out best response is to head for the hills. But all Kimball can offer instead is a one-line summation: \\"the answer to a cultural revolution is not counterrevolution but recuperation\\". He does not tell us what that means, however, nor how to achieve it.<br /><br />Thus we have to look elsewhere to find strategies for reclaiming the culture. But as a helpful overview of the 60s revolution and the damage it has wrought, this is as good a volume as any, and well worth the read.ture war succeeded, but offers no real advice for the way ahead.

US	52661388	RUZSXP587I45S	1594030030	503769077	Anti-Americanism	Books	5	28	31	N	N	An exercise in moral clarity	Revel is a bit of a rarity: he is a French intellectual who does not hate America. Unlike many of his elitist countrymen, he actually believes that all things considered, America has been a force for good in the world. In this regard he does have some French predecessors, most notably de Tocqueville.<br /><br />Revel, a conservative social commentator, has written some important volumes in the past few decades. He penned The Totalitarian Temptation in 1976, and How Democracies Perish in 1984. However this volume most closely resembles his best-selling Without Marx or Jesus (1970). In it he argued that Europeans and others have an irrational dislike of America, and much of the revulsion is based not on fact nor evidence, but on a priori perceptions and dislikes.<br /><br />This theme has been treated by others of course. Paul Hollander's 1991 volume by the same title comes to mind. But for a European to write such a volume, and a Frenchman at that, makes this book even more note-worthy. He makes several salient points along the way. First, much of the anti-Americanism is due to a person's willingness to be disinformed. Psychological and ideological imperatives have simply trumped the evidence.<br /><br />Second, much of the French and European dislike of America is fuelled by their own shortcomings and failures. That is, the very fact that America, not Europe, is today the sole super-power is in many ways due to the failings and weaknesses of Europe itself.<br /><br />Third, much of the criticism levelled at the US is duplicitous, given that those making the charges are often guilty of the same ills, and worse.<br /><br />Never mind that it was in Europe that the last two World Wars broke out. Never mind that it was Europe that had its share of dictatorships, unlike America. Never mind that it was Europe that spawned the two most oppressive ideologies of recent history: Nazism and Communism. It is much easier to make America the scapegoat for the sins of the world that to face up to one's own shortcomings and deficiencies.<br /><br />Revel of course acknowledges that America has made many mistakes, just as all nations have. But he rightly points out that there is a difference between being critical of the US and being anti-American. Balanced and fair-minded critiques are always required. But anti-Americanism is as irrational as it is pathological. The truth is, for all its faults, the US has done many praise-worthy and valuable things, both at home and abroad.<br /><br />For example, it was the hard-headed political realism of Reagan (along with Thatcher), coupled with cruise missiles in Europe and the threat of the SDI that finally tipped Communism over the edge. Of course its own internal economic failings also played a role. But for all the criticism Europeans and others made of Reagan's tough stance against Soviet imperialism, in the end it proved to be wonderfully successful and prophetically correct.<br /><br />America's newer fight against terror is another case in point. Revel reminds us that appeasement and wishful thinking have never stopped terrorists before. Just as Europe tried (and failed miserably) to appease Hitler seven decades ago, so today many are seeking to negotiate and reason with the terrorists. But, says Revel, the Islamist terrorists do not just hate the West for what it does but for what it is. Until the entire world is under Sharia law, there can be no peace. But muddle-headed European (and other) politicians want to pin the blame on global economic disparities or the Palestinian issue.<br /><br />Or take globalisation, another pet hate of the Left. The truth is, it is market globalisation that the Left despises. They are quite happy with their own versions of globalisation, such as a world government administered by the UN. And of course Muslim extremists also favour globalisation, in the form of a worldwide Muslim state.<br /><br />Revel shows how globalisation has preceded the US, and how it has tended to have beneficial results. Those cultures exposed to it were strengthened, and not swallowed up, such as when ancient Greece, sixteenth century Italy, eighteenth century France or nineteenth century England extended their dominions.<br /><br />The US has made many mistakes, acknowledges Revel. But it has also done tremendous amounts of good. The rabid anti-Americanism so much evident in parts of Europe and elsewhere do not spring from a sober and realistic appraisal of the evidence, but of prejudices of presuppositions. A major reappraisal of the facts is urgently required, and this book is a very good place to begin.he US, and how it has tended to have beneficial results.

That is, a woman can choose to excel at motherhood, or she can choose to excel at a career, but she cannot do both simultaneously.<br /><br />As such, this book attempts to burst the bubble of the super-mom myth, the idea that one can juggle both tasks, and succeed at both. Indeed, according to Venker, a working mother comes close to being a contradiction in terms.<br /><br />Of course a mom can work part time, and some moms, especially single moms, may have no choice about full-time employment, but for the average woman, to think that one can excel in a fantastic career path, and produce great, well-developed kids at the same time is simply wishful thinking.<br /><br /> The first myth, \\"Men can have it all, so why can't we\\" is just that: a myth. Most men who work full time do not spend an equal amount of time with their children. In any set of relationships there are always trade-offs. Men in full time jobs trade off the privilege of having the lengthy, intimate moments with their children that a stay-at-home mother has. And it is the same if it is the mother who is working full time.<br /><br />Indeed, the term \\"working mother\\" in this regard is misleading. If a mother chooses a full-time paid career, she is basically leaving the job of mothering to someone else. She is paying someone else to mother her children.<br /><br />Another myth is that the roles of dads and moms are fully interchangeable. They are not, because men and women are not the same. There are inherent, biological differences. As Venker demonstrates, \\"fathers will never be parents in the same way mothers are\\". Thus the androgyny ideal is a furphy.<br /><br />To speak about completely equal roles in marriage therefore is nonsense. There is never complete equality in marriage. Instead there is give and take. There are concessions and there is bargaining. Any good partnership requires a division of labor, and women seem hard-wired by nature to have more of a nurturing, caring and, well, maternal, disposition. It is not just breast-feeding that is the mother's distinctive.<br /><br />Another myth is that day care is good for children. Quite the opposite is the case. The longer a child is in day care, and from an earlier age, the worse it is for the child. As one child expert has put it, \\"A home must be very bad before it can be bettered by a good institution\\". Yet we have abandoned our children in droves to strangers. Feminists have convinced many women that they can only be fulfilled and liberated if in the paid workplace. Totally absent from the debate is the needs of the child.<br /><br />Then there is the myth that we can give our children quality time in place of quantity time. This is just plain false. Children need our undivided attention, and they need lots of it. They do not need a committee drifting in and out of their lives. They need a mother and a father, and especially a mother during the early years of life. \\"What children need - what children have always needed - is time and attention, and the undivided loyalty of one adult, preferably their mothers\\". Says Venker, \\"Anything less just isn't good enough.\\"<br /><br />Motherhood is the most noble and most important of occupations. We have allowed feminist ideology to rob us of this truth. We have allowed a market-driven economy to convince us that we are by nature working, not relational, beings. We have allowed the lure of materialism and consumerism to cause us to put wealth ahead of family.<br /><br />This may all smack of chauvinistic doubletalk. But recall that our author is a woman. And as she rightly concludes, \\"the traditional family structure is not something that holds women down. The traditional family structure simply keeps women from having to worry about producing an income while they work on the most important job of their lives.\\"ion of labor, and women seem hard-wired by nature to have more of a nurturing, caring and, well, maternal, disposition.

This tsunami of anti-marriage and anti-family activism threatens the very heart of Western society, he says. Indeed, \\"Western civilization itself appears to hang in the balance,\\" and we dare not lay down our arms at such a vital juncture in history.<br /><br />He reminds us of the words of Margaret Thatcher: \\"now is not the time to go wobbly.\\" He also reminds us that when Hitler first \\"annexed\\" Czechoslovakia in the late 1930s, the response of the rest of Europe was startling: it did nothing. Appeasement, and/or ignoring the threat, seemed to be the basic responses of European nations.<br /><br />In the face of such a feeble response, Hitler continued his march to dominate all of Europe. It was left to Britain and Churchill to stem the tide. Dobson notes that Churchill called this war the most preventable conflict in history.<br /><br />The battle to protect marriage is in many ways similar. Burke's admonition comes to mind here: \\"All that is needed for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\\" The church can stand up and be counted, or it can retreat into quietude and indifference.<br /><br />Dobson urges the faithful to stand up and be counted. He begins his volume by retracing how America came to be in the mess it now finds itself in. He points out that the rot set in during the late 1960s. California became the first state in the world to introduce no-fault divorce laws in 1969, and soon the rest of the West followed suit.<br /><br />This was part of the 1960s sexual revolution, which also saw the growth and development of cohabitation. Thus the foundations of marriage and family have been softened up for some three decades now. The next crucial blow to marriage came on 26 June 2003, when the US Supreme Court declared that there is a Constitutional right to sodomy. And then in November of that year, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court proclaimed the right to same-sex marriage. And on May 17 of 2004 that state began issuing marriage licenses to homosexuals.<br /><br />Thus a handful of judicial activists have overturned the morals and norms of a nation. The implications of this are worrying indeed. Dobson thus outlines 11 reasons why this battle must be won. The first is the protection of heterosexual marriage and family. Once a nation forgets the reason why marriage and family are important, it will soon recognise and bless all manner of sexual relationships, regardless of how harmful they may be to individuals, to children, and society.<br /><br />Dobson quotes leftist columnist Michael Kinsley in this regard. He had written an op-ed piece for the Washington Post in July 2003, arguing that we should \\"abolish marriage\\" and \\"get the government out of our bedrooms\\". Said Kinsley, the \\"solution is to end the institution of marriage\\". If three people want to get married, \\"let `em\\" opined Kinsley. He continued, \\"If marriage were an entirely private affair, all the disputes over gay marriage would become irrelevant\\".<br /><br />But that is just the point. Marriage is not merely a private affair. It is a social institution with very real social ends. That is why societies and governments should be concerned about it and supportive of it.<br /><br />Another reason why we must win this battle, argues Dobson, is because children will suffer if we do not prevail. He reminds us that there are now over 10,000 studies that show overwhelmingly and conclusively that children do best when raised by a biological mother and father cemented by marriage. If this is the case, we dare not settle for second best. And same-sex marriages will of necessity not involve this ideal family unit.<br /><br />Another concern is that religious freedom will be greatly jeopardised. Once we legalise same-sex marriage and adoption rights, a host of relatedlegislation will be passed, making it very difficult for anyone, especially religious people, from expressing any moral or social concerns about homosexuality. As a case in point, Canada recently passed Bill C-250, which effectively makes it illegal for anyone to criticise homosexuality.<br /><br />Dobson also has a chapter on the importance of treating homosexuals with respect and decency, as we resist their destructive social agenda. We must speak the truth in love, as we are enjoined to do in Scripture. The homosexual lobby is very good at intimidating, threatening and vilifying those who oppose their agenda. Yet we must respond in the opposite spirit.<br /><br />Dobson concludes by arguing for the passage of the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would preclude same-sex marriage. This will be a difficult battle, but we must persevere: \\"How can we remain silent when the next generation hangs in the balance?\\" asks Dobson., a host of related legislation will be passed, making it very difficult for anyone, especially religious people, from expressing any moral or social concerns about homosexuality.

Today global fertility rates are half what they were in 1972.<br /><br />Europe of course leads the way, with precariously low levels. Italy for example has just 1.2 children per woman. Spain is doing even worse, with 1.15 children. These two nations are experiencing the lowest fertility rates ever seen in recorded history.<br /><br />All together, 59 nations making up 44 per cent of the world's population, are not producing enough children to avoid population decline.<br /><br />What are the implications of such a demographic time bomb? Simply stated, we are rapidly becoming an aging society, with ever shrinking pools of young people. This has very real repercussions on many fronts. But a major worry of governments is how we are going to pay for this growing pool of the elderly, with these declining fertility rates.<br /><br />As but one example, in Europe today there are 35 people of pensionable age for every 100 people of working age. If present trends continue, by 2050 there will be 75 pensioners for every 100 workers.<br /><br />Longman asks why this demographic trend is unfolding before our eyes. One major factor is that it simply costs a huge amount of money to raise a child today. The increasing number of working women, and women in higher education, is another factor. So too are such reasons as declining male wages, fear of divorce, rising taxes, the absence of grandparents as child carers, contraception use and abortion.<br /><br />The economic component is certainly a leading cause of childlessness. Human capital in general, and people in particular, are dwindling because the economy demands more of its workers to be well-educated, while it does not provide the time or the money for that education. In the past the best nurturing and education of future workers came from parents themselves. They were best placed to raise well-developed children who in turn would become productive members of the workplace.<br /><br />But governments today are simply not compensating parents for this vital role. It simply is not economically worthwhile for parents to pour themselves into their children, when governments do not acknowledge and reward this valuable service.<br /><br />Parents provide quality future members of the workforce, and they curtail an aging population. The returns to society are huge, but the returns to parents continue to shrink. And taxation is a major means by which parents are penalised today.<br /><br />In the past governments paid men a family wage to adequately account for dependent wives and children, Today we have nearly the opposite situation, with families amongst the most heavily taxed groupings in society. Parents currently face huge tax burdens which most other individuals do not. Thus it just does not pay to have children.<br /><br />So how do we turn things around? Removing economic disincentives is obviously key. Substantial tax relief for parents is a first vital step. Longman also proposes the encouragement of home-based employment and family business.<br /><br />Other options are canvassed. While they may not serve as a panacea, the truth is that currents trends are unsustainable. The increasing growth of the number of elderly people, coupled by a decline in our birthrates, is a recipe for disaster. Any volume that alerts us to the dangers and offers some alternatives, as this book does, provides a useful service indeed.themselves.

US	52661388	R1LEG0DRJBQTL5	0802821715	835986097	Does Christianity Teach Male Headship?: The Equal-Regard Marriage and Its Critics	Books	5	19	20	N	N	New light on old debate	The issue of the relationship between men and women is a vexed and complex issue. Plenty of volumes have been written on this contentious debate. Does Scripture teach a patriarchal model, or an egalitarian model, or indeed, some other model? Should men rule in the home and women submit, and if so, to what extent? Can men and women be fully equal yet have different roles and functions?<br /><br /> These questions have been dealt with extensively over the years, with volumes on all sides of the debate appearing on a regular basis. Many deal just with the theological, biblical and hermeneutical issues. Other deal more with the social, historical and philosophical questions.<br /><br /> This volume tries to do a bit of each. It features theologians, to be sure, but also has sociologists, family experts, and others entering the debate. Catholic and Protestant voices are both heard. And social issues, such as the honour-shame culture of the Greco-Roman world, early household codes, and contemporary concerns about father absence, are all featured in this spirited collection of essays.<br /><br /> The first half of the volume features six proponents of the &quot;equal-regard marriage&quot; which rejects the concept of male headship. Five critics of this position are then given equal time, in which they reaffirm a male headship model as the biblical norm.<br /><br /> An introductory essay by David Blankenhorn and a concluding essay by Don Browning round off this collection of important articles. New light is shed on a long standing debate, with various innovative perspectives brought to bear on the discussion. One suspects that many people will come to this volume with their minds already made up, but the volume?s new insights and approaches may result in some new thinking on the issue.<br /><br /> The editors are to be congratulated for bringing together this collection of informed and cogent essays. The debate will not be resolved here, but it will be made more clear and further advanced by this helpful book.	2004-07-21

The nature of radical Islam, the threat of terrorism, the doctrine of just war, and the place of American power in a turbulent world are the major issues treated. University of Chicago professor of social and political ethics Jean Bethke Elsthain is well suited to this task.<br />She deftly merges the various streams of philosophy, theology, ethics, politics and international relations into a coherent account of how the US in particular and the West in general should proceed after September 11. She reminds us that appeasing terrorism is not the answer, yet we need to deal with the threat of militant Islam in a way that does not violate our own ethical codes and political ideals.<br />As such, this book has a bearing on recent events which were unknown at the time of writing, notably the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandals. How can democratic nations defend both their values and their borders against an enemy that does not play by the rules, and is happy to use the freedoms associated with democracy in its attempts to destroy it? How can we uphold ethical standards and at the same time weed out those committed to undermining our way of life?<br />How can democratic nations respond to terror without resorting to terror? Indeed, can moral distinctions be made in this regard? Is all killing and the use of force evil, or is it sometimes justified? Should we accept the argument of moral equivalence which states that American use of force is just as bad as Muslim terrorism? And, as some assert, did America bring September 11 upon itself?<br />These and other questions are expertly addressed in this incisive work. An overriding theme of the volume is that America has a moral and civil obligation to withstand those who seek to destroy it. American has the right to defend freedom and the ideals and values that make America a beacon for many around the world.<br />Indeed, the author is also one of sixty signatories of &quot;What We're Fighting For,&quot; which is included as an appendix to this book. This document explores some of these core values and the right of a democratic nation to celebrate those values as well as defend them, when necessary.<br />Segments of this volume examine the political realism of Tillich and Niebuhr, and lay out the doctrine of just war as elaborated by Augustine, Aquinas and others. Augustine said that tranquillitas ordinis, or ordinary civic peace, was the primary responsibility which a government must provide. Without  secure civic order, none of the basic human goods that people aspire to can flourish.<br />Thus a just government will protect its people from internal anarchy and outward threats. And one of the greatest outward threats that Western nations face today comes from terrorists and fanatics, often associated with Islamic extremism. What happened on September 11 2001 was not the first of such assaults, but it was the most glaring and horrific. September 11 put the world on notice that there is a clash of civilisations underway, as Samuel Huntington has phrased it.<br />Those nations that value human dignity, religious freedom, and democratic polity are pitted against those who hate such values and want them eliminated altogether. The Osama bin Ladens of the world do not just want Western nations to withdraw to a small part of the globe, but they want them exterminated. We need to take the words of these fanatics at face value. When they say they hate what we represent and want to see us overrun by the rule of a theocratic Islam, they mean it. They have openly proclaimed that they are involved in holy war, and that their cause is right.<br />As such, free nations have a moral and civil obligation to withstand these terrorists and prevent them from implementing their agenda. It is neither Christian nor responsible to appease such opponents, nor seek to pretend that such threats do not exist. Loving your neighbour includes protecting them from harm and maintaining their dignity as human beings. Terrorists do not  respect the democratic ideals nor the Christian virtues. Therefore a just war against terrorism is in order, and one does not have to have grave moral misgivings about it. To withstand the enemies of freedom and democracy is both a right and an obligation.<br />The author is to be commended for reminding us of these truths, because too many Western apologists for terrorism and radical Islam are at work seeking to convince us otherwise. At a time of ethical uncertainty, the need for moral clarity is all the more urgent, and this book is a clarion call to remind ourselves of what it is that we value and why. It deserves a wide and considered reading.cludes protecting them from harm and maintaining their dignity as human beings. Terrorists do not  respect the democratic ideals nor the Christian virtues.

Born of humble beginnings with a laudable aim, it soon mushroomed into a powerful tool of feminists and gender benders to remake the world in their own image.<br />Title IX had as its purpose the simple prevention of discrimination based on sex, when it comes to participation in any education program or activity. It soon came to bear heavily on the area of sports participation. And it soon went from a simple plea for equity to another affirmative action program, complete with preferences and quotas.<br />And with many affirmative action programs, it demanded not just equality of opportunity, but equality of outcome as well. And when unequals are treated equally, or are mandated to have equal outcomes, then real inequality results. New discrimination and inequality came into play. Boys and men, and boy's and men's programs, especially in sports, were the real casualty. Many male sports programs and activities were axed or cut back in funding, in order to get the 50-50 mix.<br />But it went even further, and Gavora documents the many heart breaking cases. For example, one University was not content with the 50-50 mix in athletics' spending and programs, but insisted it be 53-47, since 53% of the student body was female.<br />And it was not just males and male programs that suffered. Females also suffered. For example, if a girl really preferred to be a cheer leader instead of a football halfback, she often found her desires frustrated, with the gender equity police insisting that females not take on what they perceived to be traditional female roles.<br />A regime of androgyny, in other words, was enforced by the gender benders, regardless of the whether it was in the best interests of all concerned. Thus tax payers subsidised a system which was often out of kilter with the biological realities of those involved.<br />The feminists insisted that male-female differences are only social constructs, not something rooted in our very nature. They insisted that the sexes are identical in their interests and abilities. And they insisted that such parity be fully represented in our schools, even in our sports, with the full force of the law brought to bear on those who do not comply.<br />Guided by these stubborn, and often irrational, convictions, they insisted that if a school has 33 boys playing soccer, then 33 girls should be playing it as well. They insisted that if males are over-represented in advanced maths and sciences, then this `obvious injustice' must be remedied by force of law. Never mind that there may in fact be good reasons why such iniquities exist. Never mind that males tend to prefer sport more than females. Never mind that boys may be hotwired by nature to excel in science while doing poorer in other academic subjects.<br />But such differences are clearly documented by the social sciences. The emerging fields of genetics and evolutionary psychology, and our growing understanding of male and female sex hormones, are all pointing in the same direction: males and females are different. These are innate and deeply rooted differences. Environmental and social factors do explain in part these differences, but they are only a small part of the equation.<br />From quite early ages boys will engage in rough and table group play much more than will girls. Young girls are much more interested in play parenting than play fighting, reflecting their natural tendency for nurturing and personal relationships. Males are more aggressive and competitive, while females are more likely to avoid risk and to develop relationships. And because of these differences, not only do more males like to play sport, but more males like to watch sport as well.<br />Nature it seems has hardwired such differences into us, and government attempts to act as if they do not exist, or to seek to eradicate them, can only result in chaos andgrief. Indeed, given that males have 10 to 20 times more testosterone than females, it is folly to ignore the very real biological and psychological differences between the sexes.<br />This volume documents how ideology and social activism, instead of sound reason and good science, determine much of our social policy. The results have been disastrous, with many casualties along the way. A mandated androgynous ideal may appeal to feminists and government bureaucrats, but it does real damage to ordinary men and women, as this book so clearly shows.grief.

But the data that is coming in is not good. We are allowing an entire generation of babies and young children to be raised by strangers. While adults might benefit from such arrangements, the well-being of children is being put at risk.<br />That is the sobering conclusion of a new volume by a research fellow at the Washington-based Family Research Council. With extensive documentation Robertson demonstrates how extended periods of day care are harming our children.<br />Robertson shows how feminist ideology, coupled with a sympathetic media and a cowardly academy, have managed to convince many that parenting is too important to be left to mere parents, that bureaucrats know better than mom and dad, and that day care centers are in fact good for children.<br />All three of these emphases are incorrect. But the growth of the day care industry is hard to counter. In the US, federal subsidies to the child care market rocketed from $2 billion in 1965 to $15 billion in 2000. And as more and more mothers enter the paid work force (most because of economic necessity, not personal preference) the day care juggernaut races onwards.<br />These social trends have resulted in a devaluing of motherhood, a weakening of the family unit, and most importantly, negative outcomes for our children. The harmful effects of extended periods of day care include higher rates of illness, greater chance of sexual abuse, higher rates of aggression, and greater risk of antisocial personality disorders.<br />The emotional, psychological and physical harm to children who spend lengthy amounts of time in day care has been well documented for some decades now. Yet the social science evidence is often attacked, covered up or ignored. Those who try to present the evidence are personally abused and vilified. It is just not politically correct to tell the truth on this issue.<br />The story of researcher Jay Belsky is a case in point. As an early proponent of day care, he was the darling of feminists and academia. But his research caused him to have a change of heart, and when he started to publish data showing negative consequences, he was furiously opposed.<br />Although he sought to be as cautious and restrained as possible, the child care establishment and its supporters distorted his findings and blackballed his research. He quickly became persona non grata in the eyes of many. Robertson carefully chronicles this and similar episodes in the day care wars.<br />Robertson reviews the studies which show how early day care harms the mother-infant bond which is so important in a child's development. Of course defenders of day care put a different spin on the findings. Children in day care are not more aggressive, simply more \\"independent\\". And they even try to say that if such aggression exists, it is a virtue, not a vice.<br />Moreover, they argue that children do better socially and educationally when in day care. But the solid research on these matters points in the other direction. Robertson cites many studies showing how children are disadvantaged on the academic and social levels, when kept in day care.<br />He also notes that when a study does come out which suggests that children do well, even better, in day care, it is always front page news. But when the more numerous and reliable studies come along, warning of the negative consequences, they are buried in the back pages of the press, if they appear at all.<br />Robertson competently takes on a number of myths about day care. For example, he challenges the myth that the poor need, and want, day care. He documents how in the US, the families most likely to use center-based day care are those earning $75,000 a year. Surveys show that the vast majority of low-income moms prefer to have their children stay at home in their early years. He even demonstrates that moms who want to put their children into day care are \\"atypical\\".<br />The fact that so many parents do resort to day care is evidence of economic policies that make it very hard on single-income families. Instead of putting more money into day care, we should be restructuring our economic policies so that those families who choose to let their infants stay at home in the early years can do so.<br />But much of the modern corporate world is in league with feminist ideology here. Both identify women's interests with \\"independence from husbands and family, and a corresponding greater dependence on corporation and government\\". Earlier feminists recognised the importance of the home and of motherhood. Modern feminists do not, and much of the free market is happy to side with the new version of things.<br />Thus Robertson calls for an overhaul of both government and corporate practices, to reflect the desire of most mothers to be at home with their babies. His concluding chapter offers suggestions on how parents can reclaim parenting. Social and taxation policies must be reworked to allow for genuine parental choice. Those parents who wish to look after their own children should be given the financial incentives to do so.<br />This book provides the data and rationale for why we need to rethink our priorities and revamp of policies.

US	52661388	R2R2R2NINBZJNA	1893554937	908224304	Taking Sex Differences Seriously	Books	5	163	195	N	N	Vive la difference	It might seem odd to have to pen a book like this, but we live in odd times. Throughout history people have known that men and women are different. But recently we have been told that men and women are not different after all. Perceived differences are due to society, not biology, and sex and gender differences are both interchangeable and malleable.<br />In this view, gender is a social construction. Moreover, one can change one's gender like one changes one's clothes. Male today, female tomorrow, bisexual one day, homosexual the next. This is the brave new world of the gender benders.<br />The thesis Rhoads offers is simple: men and women are different, and these differences are basic, profound and rooted in our very nature. With a wealth of documentation and research, Rhoads sets the record straight, informing us of the clear scientific and biological case for male-female differences.<br />Hormones and other chemical/biological determinants cannot be dismissed when assessing gender. Their very presence means that nature has hotwired the human species into two clearly different sexes, and these differences cannot be wished away by social engineers.<br />And these changes can be found from our earliest moments, refuting the notion that social or environmental factors are the sole explanations for such differences. For example, day-old infants will cry when they hear a recording of another infant crying, but girls will cry longer than boys.<br />Women tend to be more communitarian, more nurturing and less aggressive than men. Researchers have found that there are universal constants running throughout every known human society, including division of labour by sex, women being the primary child carers, and the dominance of men in the public sphere.<br />Now if sex differences were due to socialization, and not biology (nurture, nor nature) then we would expect to see these differences quickly fading, at least in western cultures, where sex role changes have been most dramatic. But this has not been the case.<br />These differences, in other words are enduring and they are significant. No amount of social reconstruction will make them disappear. If so, argues Rhoads, we are doing great damage to men, women and society when we act as if they do not exist. Forcing little Johnny to play with dolls and compelling little Jennie to play with toy soldiers, in other words, is counterproductive, and may simply make things worse.<br />Those who seek 50/50 marriages, for example, and attempt a complete equality of roles and jobs usually come to frustration. Conflicts tend to be higher in such households, and child rearing also suffers as a result. And role-reversal families tend to be short-lived, with most reverting to more traditional patterns.<br />Those who seek to turn their children into androgynous role models find they only come to grief in their attempts. Children cannot be taught to change what they are by nature.<br />Rhoads also notes that those researchers who seek to demonstrate the biological and physiological fixity of the sexes have real trouble getting funding and publicity, because of the stranglehold of political correctness and feminist orthodoxy. And the majority of these sex difference researchers happen to be women.<br />And he shows that if sex differences are indeed true, then there are implications for what sort of family structures we promote. He details the now familiar evidence of how children, and especially boys, suffer in fatherless households. A mother just cannot replicate what a father provides in a home, just as a dad cannot take the place of a mother.<br />And children need a biological father living in the home, says Rhoads. Step-dads, boyfriends, male role-models, just do not cut it. Children need both sexes: they need a biological mother and a father, not a committee, not an alternative lifestyle arrangement.<br />Career options too need to be reassessed. We need to rethink the wisdom of putting career first and children last. Mums can do certain things dads cannot, and it is not just breastfeeding. Women are the nurturers and child carers throughout the world, not because of male chauvinism, but because of their very natures.<br />And whole nations need a rethink. Social engineers, like the Swedes and the Israeli kibbutzim, have tried long and hard to eradicate stereotypical sex roles and to enforce androgyny. But both experiments have failed miserably.<br />And feminism must be rethought. Women are losing their choices, not expanding them, when they follow the feminist script. Women in fact tend to like having babies and raising children - it is part of who they are. So it does no good for feminists to say to women that they should deny these instincts and seek instead careers.<br />Pregnancy and childbirth can be adversely affected by high-powered careers. The harm of stress impacts not just the mum, but is transferred to the baby in the womb as well. The vital importance of breastfeeding is also jeopardised by careers. Thus we are selling women short, as well as the next generation, when we insist that women can have it all. They can, but not necessarily at the same time.<br />The debate over day care also arises here. If mothers are best equipped by nature to care for and nurture the young, then we should stop the rush to let strangers raise our children. The benefits to children of being looked after by mom for the first few years are clearly documented. So whose interests do we put first in this regard?<br />In sum, this is a great book. Feminists will hate it. Social engineers will detest it. And slaves to political correctness will wretch over it. But ordinary men and women will find it a breath of fresh air. And in the stagnant stench of modern ideologies, fresh air is just what we need.areer first and children last. Mums can do certain things dads cannot, and it is not just breastfeeding.

Feminists will hate it. Social engineers will detest it. And slaves to political correctness will wretch over it. But ordinary men and women will find it a breath of fresh air. And in the stagnant stench of modern ideologies, fresh air is just what we need.	2004-06-04
US	52661388	R33GGGMTWC7BSQ	0805076336	15072522	Gay Marriage: Why It Is Good for Gays, Good for Straights, and Good for America	Books	1	41	99	N	N	Faulty argumentation and selective evidence	This is the most compelling book so far to make the case for same-sex marriage (SSM). However, as a defense of gay marriage, Jonathan Rauch's Gay Marriage suffers from a number of flaws.<br />For example, Rauch says equality before the law demands that there be no exception as to who can marry. He illustrates his point by saying that in the US, \\"homosexuals cannot legally marry anyone they love. There is no heterosexual in this position.\\" This of course is just blatantly false.<br />As a married male, I cannot marry another woman. I cannot marry my son. I cannot marry a group of people. It is of course fully possible for me to deeply love another woman, my son, and a select group of people, perhaps even at the same time. But that love does not mean I can marry the object of my love.<br />This is one of the fundamental flaws in Rauch's book. The very same arguments he uses for SSM can be used for the legal recognition and celebration of any number of loving sexual relationships, be it incest, polygamy, and so on. The same arguments apply.<br />Of course Rauch deals with these objections, but dismisses them as lacking in merit. He says such \\"anything goes\\" arguments are easily dealt with. The promotion of incest or group sex are not in the same league as the case for SSM he says, and argues that they can be opposed on other grounds. He concludes by saying that  \\"when heterosexuals get the right to marry two other people or a sibling or a dog or a Volkswagon, homosexuals should get that right also. Until then, there is no reason to discuss it.\\"<br />But there is. When de facto or cohabiting relationships first received equal recognition under law, making them equal with marriage (at least here in Australia), conservative voices warned that this would be the thin edge of the wedge. People in other types of relationships would soon be demanding the same benefits of marriage.<br />We were of course scoffed at and derided for suggesting such way-out possibilities. Well, those possibilities have now become realities, and there is plenty of discussion on the Web, in gay newspapers, in academia, and elsewhere, for these other sorts of relationships to be formally and  publicly recognised as well. True, such voices may now be in the very small minority. But so were advocates of SSM thirty years ago. Indeed, Rauch does admit later that \\"legalization of same-sex marriage might lessen resistance to other forms of change.\\"<br />Moreover, no homosexual is denied the right to marry, if he should so choose to marry someone of the opposite sex. Of course Rauch dismisses such an argument, and says homosexuals cannot help it, they have no choice in the matter, and nature has made them that way. This is another major flaw in his book. Not only is there no clear scientific evidence available for any sort of genetic basis to homosexuality, but some of the more honest gay activists have admitted that there is a real element of choice in the gay lifestyle.<br />Rauch  simply dismisses talk of therapy for gays, the reality of ex-gays, and so on. But to dismiss something because you don't want to acknowledge it is no argument at all. The truth is, there are hundreds of centers around the world devoted to helping gays who want to go straight. And there are many thousands of ex-homosexuals who have given up on their lifestyle. Some have gone on to heterosexual marriage and have had children. But for Rauch they simply do not exist.<br />Rauch believes that most gay men will eventually embrace marriage. But there is a huge debate in the gay community about this issue, with many gays opposed to the idea altogether, and many quite happy to settle for types of civil unions, and so on. And even those who do favor marriage, like Andrew Sullivan, admit that their version of marriage is quite different from the traditional understanding. Sullivan for example speaks of the need for \\"extra-marital outlets\\" in his version of marriage.<br />Rauch is asking for a revolutionary social change. He does admit that when we tinker with tradition, we never know what might happen. \\"A catastrophe cannot be ruled out\\" he concedes. Yet abounding optimism and wishful thinking characterise his argument.<br />This hope that everything will turn out all right is found in many stages of his argument. For example, he states a number of times that gay marriage will tame the cruising gay male, domesticate him, and make him more committed in relationships. Thus SSM will be good for gays and the rest of society. But as Maggie Gallagher pointed out some years ago, it is not marriage that tames the male, but women. This is the missing ingredient in SSM. Marriage is an important part of the equation, but so too are members of both sexes.<br />In sum, this is the best book to date to give the case for SSM. It is carefully argued and well-written. But it seems to be just so much special pleading and it seems to presume too many unproven basics. Nonetheless Rauch has done a very good job of stating his case, and he may well win over a number of converts to his cause. But the debate is not yet over, and a forceful case can still be made for the heterosexual nature of marriage.tionary social change.

Chambers left Communism for Christianity, at a time when, in the eyes of many, it was not expedient to do so.  So too, Horowitz, a leading leftwing intellectual of the 60s and 70s, had second thoughts. For both men, the change in thinking was costly, with severe reactions to their defections.<br />This book, a collection of articles, most of which were published before, gives us an intellectual history of Horowitz's rise in the Left, and his eventual disaffection with it. Thus it includes some of his earlier leftist pieces, including some published in the radical Ramparts, which he formerly edited. But the bulk of the articles here come from his new found conservatism, and feature some of his best writings from the late 70s to 2003.<br />Howorwitz has already covered his second thoughts in book form, especially in Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts About the Sixties (co-written with Peter Collier in 1989), and Radical Son (1997). Here he covers a wide range of issues, with all of the conservative battlegrounds given a run. Thus some three decades worth of controversy are covered, with articles on Solzhenitsyn, Nicaragua, racism, political correctness on campus, AIDS, free speech, multiculturalism, the Middle East crisis, terrorism, and the Clinton years all given judicious treatment.<br />Unlike Chambers, it was not a religious conversion that prompted this change of heart. It was a growing awareness that the Left was simply hypocritical, constantly denouncing supposed atrocities of capitalism and American foreign policy, while ignoring or condoning the barbarism of socialism and leftist dictatorships. An enormous amount of human blood had been shed on the altars of leftist utopianism, Horowitz discovered.<br />Thus as someone who has been there and done that, his criticisms of the left deserve to be heard. Not many have renounced their leftwing past. I happen to have been one to do so, but there are not that many around. Irving Kristol once said that a neoconservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality. It seems that may leftists prefer to live with their illusions than take a stand for reality.<br />Horowitz chronicles the extreme reaction of fellow leftists to his realignment. He was hoping that others would see the light, but instead he received vitriol, censure and abuse. He had hoped that other radicals would make this acknowledgment: &quot;We greatly exaggerated the sins of America and underestimated its decencies and virtues, and we're sorry&quot;. But such confessions were few and far between. Most leftists clung to their utopianism, to the &quot;god that failed&quot;.<br />Like Chambers, his new found conservatism is still a minority position. There exists a left-liberalism hegemony in the US and the West that makes it hard for countering views to be heard. Horowitz documents the uphill battle in promoting a conservative voice in such a climate.<br />Thus one has to ask why anyone would want to surrender a seemingly winning position for what appears to be a lost cause. Horowitz has asked himself this question many times, as had Chambers. His last lines in this book address the question again, as he asks whether the truth will continue to remain in the shadows. He hopes that it won't.<br />And for those like myself who have followed a similar road, and have taken similar U-turns, one's hopes are buoyed by knowing that one is not alone, and that others have made similar journeys. Horowitz retains his Jewish faith. Chambers, and I, embraced Christianity. But all three of us know that truth is powerful, and truth will prevail. This volume provides solid meat for those who have made the change, and for those who have not yet done so. May it result in many more second thoughts.Not many have renounced their leftwing past.

US	52661388	R25I2S0DWN72D9	1890626368	175359882	The Long Truce: How Toleration Made the World Safe for Power and Profit	Books	5	15	15	N	N	When toleraton is no virtue	We live in an age where virtues have become vices, and vices have become virtues. What most societies shuttered at just decades ago is now paraded and promoted, especially by popular culture. And the old virtues, like faithfulness in marriage, truth-telling, humility and concern for others, are now mocked and derided as hopelessly out of date.<br />The old virtues have all but disappeared. But there is one \\"virtue\\" that has risen to the top of the charts. There is one word that is heard constantly and incessantly: \\"tolerance\\". We are to tolerate everyone and everything. All points of view and all lifestyles are to be tolerated.<br />Yet as this revealing study makes clear, the modern notion of tolerance is far removed from what it traditionally has always meant. The recent concept of tolerance is a perversion of its former self, being the polar opposite to its original meaning.<br />Today we have managed to turn tolerance into a virtue or a doctrine. It used to be a practice or a habit. It used to be based on the way we treated one another. Today it is a an ism promoted by the state for its own ends.  It used to be seen as a means to an end. Today it is treated as an end in itself.<br />In the past, you tolerated someone, treated them with respect, even though you might violently disagree with their beliefs or their lifestyle. Today, to tolerate someone means you must also embrace their philosophy, their worldview, their lifestyle. That is a big difference.<br />In this historical and philosophical inquiry, Conyers examines how the concept of tolerance has changed over the last few centuries. He argues that its redefinition emerged at the same time as the modern nation state arose. He argues that there is a connection between the rise of the centralization of power in the modern state, and this redefinition of tolerance.<br />The modern idea of tolerance first arose in the seventeenth century. He argues that two parallel developments, the rise of the nation state, and emergence of the isolated individual, served as a backdrop to the changing concept of tolerance. As mediating institutions like the church and family began to wane, increasingly isolated and fragmented individuals had to be kept in check by growing state bureaucracies. Indeed, a pressing question for thinkers of this time was, how could a mass of individuals be controlled, when former social glues like religion and community were in decline?<br />Natural groups like the family and other associations are easily contained. But unnatural groups, like the organised state, need other means to achieve social harmony and conflict resolution. How can individuals live together in peace when natural groupings break down? The state, in order to reduce threats to its centralisation and control, had produced a concept of toleration which minimised absolutes, sought to water down religious and moral conviction, and promoted a fuzzy egalitarianism.<br />Thus questions of ultimate meaning are settled, not by religion or morality, but by the state. The state maintains power by subsuming to itself powers formerly held by family, religion and the church. Mediating structures between the individual and the state were seen as threats, and the philosophical understanding of tolerance changed to accommodate the centralizing powers of the state.<br />That is why those who today argue that family does not mean any and all types of relationships, or those who proclaim that the Christian message is exclusive and absolutely true, are seen as such a threat by the state and its supporters. A watered down religion, and an amorphous definition of family, are acceptable in today's climate, but an insistence on truth and absolutes is not. Thus relativism rules.<br />Conyers looks at how modern thinkers such as Hobbes and Locke altered our understanding of tolerance, to make it serve the interests of the rising state powers. He argues that we need to return to the earlier, Christian understandingof tolerance. That understanding was based on humility, not indifference.<br />Indeed, the modern attempt to disavow absolutes and certainty have made matters worse, not better. Our times are characterised by doubt, fear and distrust. The old verities and certainties have been jettisoned for a hodge-podge of multiculturalism, relativism and apathy. In an age if uncertainty, people continue to look for assurance and direction. The state cannot provide this. All it can offer is bread and circuses. But even these are not enough. Thus the persistence of marriage and family and credal religion.<br />The modern promoters of secularism and tolerance may have won in the halls of power and influence (academia, the media, etc.), but the common person looks for something more sure. A notion of tolerance that waters down all convictions, that squashes dissent, and preaches relativism, is not going to satisfy.<br />Says Conyers, the early Judeo-Christian understanding of tolerance is preferred. Strong conviction, based on eternal verities, coupled with humility and love, is the right sort of tolerance. Indeed, he argues that the right sort of tolerance is necessarily a theological one.<br />The modern doctrine of toleration promotes isolation, but the practice of real toleration pushes us gently to community. Thus we need to reclaim the lost tradition of real tolerance. The modern hijacking of the concept has served the interests of those seeking economic and political power, but has not been a panacea to the struggling masses.of tolerance.

In it he looked at the personal lives of some famous Western thinkers, such as Rosseau and Marx. He noted that many of these great intellectuals had private lives that left a lot to be desired. He noted, in other words, a connection between belief and behavior.<br />In this book Paul Vitz provides a similar kind of study. He examines the lives of a number of well known atheists, and discovers that most of them had an absent or abusive father. He argues that those who have had poor relations with their earthly father also tend to have had a poor image of their heavenly father.<br />Vitz first examines those atheists whose fathers died when they were relatively young - atheists such as Nietzsche, Sartre and Bertrand Russell. Then he assesses atheists who had weak or abusive fathers, eg., Voltaire, Feuerbach and Freud. Finally, as a control group, he studies some notable theists and their fathers - men such as Edmund Burke, Pascal, Chesterton and John Henry Newman.<br />These psychological profiles make a strong case for his main thesis - fathers matter, and the worldview we carry with us into adulthood is largely determined in childhood. With the resurgence of the fatherhood movement, especially in America, this is all the more timely. Ideas do have consequences, and our ideas are heavily influenced by our upbringing. Thus the importance of a good upbringing - one that includes a mother and a father.<br />Vitz warns about over-simplification, and recognises that there are a multitude of factors that explain or determine how we develop. However, the fact that so many atheists have similar background does make for an intriguing hypothesis. And the details Vitz provides are quite revealing. Consider but a few examples.<br />Jean-Paul Sartre's father died when he was just 15 months old. Throughout much of his adult life he mentions fathers, and denigrates fatherhood. His philosophy promotes the idea that man can become God, that we are self-made men. More than one biographer has noted his obsession about fathers and his atheism may well tie in to his own absent father.<br />According to her son (who later became a Christian), Madalyn Murray O'Hair intensely hated her father. In his memoirs, he records an ugly fight in which she tried to kill her father with a ten-inch butcher knife. She failed but screamed, &quot;I'll see you dead. I'll get you yet. I'll walk on your grave!&quot; Her son says he does not understand why she so hated her father.<br />While Vitz does note some exceptions to the pattern, he emphasises the fact that this missing ingredient of fatherhood does have a profound impact on the way a person develops and what they believe in. Vitz concludes: &quot;Since both believers and nonbelievers in God have psychological reasons for their position ... in any debate as to the truth of the existence of God, psychology should be irrelevant&quot;. Truth, facts, and the evidence should decide that question, not personality.<br />As this book makes clear, there is a real correlation between personal psycho-history and belief systems. Of course such childhood backgrounds are not fully determinative - people can and do change, rising above their circumstances and backgrounds. However, this book helps us to understand the passion and vehemence of some atheists, and shows us that philosophies can be as much a product of our social background as of hard reasoning.the idea that man can become God, that we are self-made men.

The six scholars cover all the territory, with incisive chapters on marriage and family in the Ancient Near East (ANE), in ancient Israel, in Greek society, in Roman society, in Second Temple Judaism, and in the New testament.<br />Taken together they provide  comprehensive coverage of the issues as developed over several thousand years of biblical history. Family life and marriage patterns are expertly covered in detail, as are all the related questions: divorce, sexual ethics, adoption, parenting, abortion, celibacy, children, homosexuality, and gender roles.<br />Consider the chapter on \\"Marriage and Family in Ancient Israel\\"  by Daniel Block. This is an excellent example of biblical scholarship combined with social and historical analysis. Block, who has written some excellent biblical commentaries on the book of Judges and the book of Ezekiel, here provides a detailed survey of the Old Testament understanding of marriage and family. It is very-well referenced, with 321 footnotes supplementing the 70 page chapter. All aspects of family life are covered.<br />His discussion on patriarchy is most illuminating. Block argues that the term itself is misleading, and should be replaced by the term \\"patricentrism\\". This is because the biblical emphasis is on the responsibilities of the husband, not just his privileges and power. Wives, children and even slaves were treated with respect, even if a hierarchy of authority was in order.<br />Wives especially were not second-class citizens, as some might suppose. Indeed, women were not just property of the husband, with no legal status. Instead, the dignity of the wife is affirmed in the Old Testament, as is her influence in the household. True, examples of male headship being abused appear in the biblical accounts, but they are the exception to the rule.<br />It is interesting to compare this chapter with Victor Matthews' chapter on the ANE, to see some contrasts and similarities. He discusses a number of practices which are very much in the news today, including contraception, abortion and homosexuality.<br />His chapter, along with the chapters on Greek and Roman families, show that although many differences exist, there have been some constants throughout this period. Family life has always been the center of all societies; marriage has been the norm; polygamy was always the exception; and homosexuality was nowhere widely embraced.<br />The last two articles on Second Temple (intertestamental) Judaism, and the New testament, show a continuation of that established by the Old Testament. Jesus of course, while affirming the traditional understanding of marriage and family, did indicate that his followers comprise a much larger family that in some ways transcends the natural family unit.<br />Thus in his calls to discipleship, willingness to leave family behind is a hallmark of serious commitment to Christ. Such radical demands do not however mean that Jesus takes a lower view of marriage and family. It is just that the demands of the gospel are to take priority over every aspect of life, no matter how good and noble they may be. Total allegiance to Jesus may mean abandoning more natural ties.<br />Of course both Peter and Paul will later to go on and reaffirm marriage and family, and even make qualification of leadership in the church dependent on how one rules in his own home. So while the New testament views marriage and family through the lens of God's kingdom and purposes, it still retains its very high status and calling.<br />This book is an excellent source of information on all things pertaining to marriage and family in the biblical world. Given the contentious debates surrounding marriage and family today, this book will provide a good historical, social and religious framework with which tojudge such discussions.judge such discussions.	2004-03-10

The Koran, Islamic law (Sharia), the example of Muhammad and Islamic history all provide support for these sorts of activities. With a wealth of documentation, the author shows that the concept of jihad (holy war) and dhimmitude (the subjugation of non-Muslim minorities), continues to strongly influence many Muslims today.<br />Consider the doctrine of jihad. Just what does it mean and involve? Because there is no ultimate central authority in Islam, argues Spencer, disagreement exists as to interpreting the Koran, the weight of tradition (Hadith), and the example of Muhammad. But the Koran (Sura 9:29), Islamic history and jurisprudence all hold that there are three choices for the non-Muslim in a Muslim land: conversion to Islam, dhimmitude, or death. \\"The goal of jihad is thus the incorporation of non-Muslims into Muslim society, either by conversion or submission.\\"<br />Koranic injunctions to fight are numerous, as they are in the various collections of Hadith. And Muhammad himself set the example of violent conquest. The idea of complete submission to Islam, even to the point of death, argues Spencer, \\"remains a vital part of Islamic theology\\".  Thus jihad is very much concerned with the concept of holy war, and even terrorism.<br />Hand in hand with jihad is the notion of dhimmitude. Non-Muslims in Muslim countries are considered dhimmis, or protected peoples. Such protection however often results in second-class citizenship (and worse) for the minority groups. Various social, political and religious restrictions, along with the mandatory payment of a poll-tax (jizya) effectively spells the gradual liquidation of the minority groups.<br />Apologists for Islam often claim that these practices may have been true in the past, but are no longer so prevalent. But Spencer amply documents how both jihad and dhimmitude are alive and well in most Muslim nations today.<br />September 11 was, to a great degree, a logical outcome of the concept of jihad. Some however argue that as the ultimate suicide bombing, Sept. 11 cannot be reconciled with Islam, since suicide is sinful in Islam. But many Muslims defend suicide bombing, arguing that it is not really suicide but martyrdom for Allah, something much praised in the Koran. They insist that the bombers simply use their bodies to kill others, not themselves. And those who are killed while fighting for Allah are promised a one-way ticket to Paradise. Interestingly, in Islam, no other action guarantees one's eternal destiny in Paradise.<br />A good part of this book documents how radical Islam is at war against not only the West, but moderate Muslims as well. He offers detailed, referenced accounts of how militant Muslims are at work in the West, and how many Western sympathisers have been duped by their words of peace and tolerance. Yes, the Koran does speak of these ideas, but it also contains many verses devoted to violent intolerance.<br />He documents how Western leftists have been silent on Muslim atrocities, presumably because only America is capable of evil. He details how leftist apologists for radical Islam in the West have distorted the evidence and closed their ears to the facts of history. This attempt to blame America first and justify Muslim jihad are having serious repercussions in the West, says Spencer.<br />And the truth is, he argues, for the radical Muslim, Islam is at war with the world, and until all the earth is brought under Dar al-Islam (the house, or rule, of Islam), terror, fighting and suicide bombings will continue. That is why the West needs to be ever vigilant, and needs to continue to encourage moderate Islam to gets its own house in order, and disassociate itself entirely from the extremist elements.<br />While we must do all we can to encourage Muslim moderation, we dare not ignore Muslim extremism. This books helps us to do both, and deserves awide reading.s a wide reading.	2004-03-10

Perhaps one of the best is this volume. Although it has been around for some years now, it still remains one of the most comprehensive, articulate and well-researched books to take on the excesses of feminism.<br />A major thesis of this volume is that while feminism may appear to be anti-men, it is even more so anti-women, at least women of a certain stripe. Wives and homemakers are the real target of radical feminists, insists Graglia, and she spends a good part of this hefty tome (450 pages) in documenting this claim.<br />The author, who is a lawyer by profession, but a homemaker by choice, has the intellectual firepower needed to take on the heavyweights of the feminists movement. The thoughts and writings of Friedan, Steinem, Greer, Millet, de Beauvoir, and all the other major movers and shakers in the feminist movement are here carefully evaluated, and their antipathy to wives and families are carefully assessed.<br />Solid chapters explore the rise of modern feminism, the feminist agenda, the totalitarian impulse in feminism, the push for androgyny, and the attack on the institutions of marriage and the traditional family, among other things.<br />The author is especially adept at showing how women cannot have it all, at least not at the same time. The push for climbing the corporate ladder invariably takes a toll on child rearing and family, and many women have suffered as a result of buying the feminist line on this issue.<br />She tackles a number of other myths, such as the idea that gender is simply a social construct, and the idea that motherhood and homemaking are somehow second class lifestyles. She shows how women have been the big losers in the feminist-promoted sexual revolution. She documents how women have suffered under no-fault divorce. And she demonstrates how the push for a purely androgynous society results in all parties losing out.<br />While acknowledging that women have the right to pursue the feminist script if they so choose, Graglia firmly believes that feminism is really anti-women. Feminism remains a destructive and destablising social force. In the end, feminism has damaged women, harmed families, and put children at risk. Strong words, but after reading her arguments one has to agree that not everything has been sweetness and light in this major social revolution. Indeed, like most revolutions, the results are often worse than the original problem.<br />While many will violently disagree with the major propositions of this volume, the author's arguments deserve a fair hearing. Spence Publishing deserves credit for running with such a volume, at a time when many other publishers wouldn't dream of offering such a daring title.ledging that women have the right to pursue the feminist script if they so choose, Graglia firmly believes that feminism is really anti-women.

The Current Controversy over Divine Foreknowledge	Books	5	67	71	N	N	A helpful defense of the traditional understanding	The debate over openness theology or free-will theism continues to bubble along nicely. Books both for and against continue to pour from the presses. In the past two decades some thirty volumes have been penned directly on this issue. One of the latest to weigh in, offering the \\"no\\" case to openness thought, is What Does God Know? Written by veteran theologian Millard Erickson, it explores one major component of openness thought, the belief that God does not know the future.  Erickson has actually written before on openness theology, with parts of The Evangelical Left ( Baker, 1997) and God the Father Almighty (Baker, 1998) offering critiques of the movement.<br />Erickson begins by assessing the biblical support offered both by open theists and classical theists. This is followed by a look at the hermenuetical issues involved. It seems these sections could have been a bit stronger, and he seems to over-rely on Bruce Ware's God's Lesser Glory (Crossway, 2000) here. But it is a good introduction to the biblical material that is being debated.<br />He next explores the historical development of God's foreknowledge, arguing that although it was not a major doctrine of the early church councils and creeds, it was in the main supported throughout church history by most of the church. There have always been dissenters on this issue, but they have tended to be in the minority, and often on the edges of orthodoxy.<br />He then explores the philosophical debate surrounding God's foreknowledge. These are some of the stronger chapters in the book, as Erickson has always had as good a grasp of philosophy as theology. He demonstrates that the claims of the openness camp concerning classical theism's over-reliance on Greek philosophy are overstated and somewhat misleading. He also shows that openness thought is also quite depended on philosophy in its own right.<br />He concludes by looking at the practical consequences of these two theological systems, and how they impinge on other major doctrines of the faith.<br />All in all this is a very good restatement of classical theology, and a very incisive and irenic critique of openness thought. Erickson is always a joy to read and he has done a good job here in defending the traditional understanding that God does indeed know all things, even the future.her major doctrines of the faith.<br />All in all this is a very good restatement of classical theology, and a very incisive and irenic critique of openness thought.

That about summarises the philosophy of Laura Kipnis. Her book offers a very jaundiced and bitter look at marriage in particular and relationships in general.<br />While acknowledging that there may in fact be some good marriages out there, somewhere, her main thesis is that marriage is bad for people. Marriage takes nice people and turns them into \\"petty dictators and household tyrants\\". All that marriage seems to do, according to the Chicago academic, is smother people with tons of rules and regulations and restrictions.<br />In fact, in her book she spends page after page providing a list of answers to the question, \\"What can't you do because you're in a couple?\\" She and a research assistant jotted down hundreds of answers, such as, you can't be a slob, you can't go to parties alone, you can't leave the bathroom door open, you can't leave the dishes for later, you can't take risks, you can't watch porn, you can't smoke pot, you can't make crumbs without wiping them up, etc. On and on it goes. It makes marriage sound like a comfortable concentration camp, to use Betty Friedan's words.<br />She also speaks of that \\"mantra of a failing relationship: `Good marriages take work!'\\" She says we use \\"the rhetoric of the factory\\" when discussing marriage and asks, \\"Who, after spending all day on the job, wants to come home and work some more?\\" Marriage, says our expert, lures people into \\"conditions of emotional stagnation and deadened desires\\".<br />But wait, there's more; the wrecking ball continues: Marriage is a social institution devoted to maximising submission and minimising freedom, she says<br />Not surprisingly, given such a grim and black portrait of marriage, Kipnis says \\"perhaps rising divorce rates are not such bad news\\". Indeed, given her version of events, a divorce ranks with the liberation of Dachau or being set free from a heroin addiction.<br />One is left with a lot of questions after reading such remarks. The first question that obviously comes to mind is: Is she now married or has she ever been? Given her jaded perspective, one suspects that she is not, or if she was, it was a pretty lousy affair.<br />But plenty of other questions come to mind, equally deserving of answers. Just what kind of world does Ms Kipnis think we should be living in? She has such a sour view of relationships and what they entail, and such a misguided notion of freedom and happiness, that it seems that the only kind of world she would be happy in is one where she is the only member. She could be quite happy in the company of one, but throw in just one more person, and life degenerates into bondage and misery. One is reminded of the quip by Groucho Marks: \\"I wouldn't belong to any club that had me as a member\\".<br />Given that she is a social theorist, this does not say much for society. Indeed, the only kind of social theory she seems to approve of is anti-social, that is, anarchy. Anarchists hate all rules and cumbersome relationships. The trouble is, to keep anarchists happy, one would need to find separate planets for each and everyone, in order for them to fully enjoy life.<br />Ms Kipnis bemoans the fact that relationships take work to succeed. Of course they do. Everything that is of value in life takes some effort and work. Nothing comes easy that is worth while. The only thing that is totally effortless is decay and deterioration. In doesn't take a lot of effort for wood to rot, for cars to rust, or for weeds to spring up. Ask any householder. Nor does it take much effort for relationships to fall apart and for marriages to collapse. All one has to do is resort to a purely selfish and self-centered lifestyle, and the relationship will collapse quick-smart.<br />Thus Ms Kipnis cannot have it both ways. If she wants any kind of social fabric or communal structure, that is going to involve some give and take, some deferral of self-gratification, some compromise, some self-sacrifice, and some humility. All relationship require that. All societies require that. All workplaces require that. I am not aware of any successfully-functioning social institution in which a lot of effort in limiting one's selfish ambitions and desires is not called for.<br />Marriage is humankind's \\"first society,\\" John Locke once said. Because marriage and family are really mini-societies, if we cannot establish cooperation, unity and harmony in the home, we will never see these virtues in society. That is why marriage and family are so important. They take essentially selfish, me-first individuals, and form them into a working and efficient social unit. Without the taming of rugged individuals in the family, no society can expect to last.<br />But we live in an age that demands instant self-gratification, that values isolated autonomy and individualism above all else, and that mocks and scorns any concern for the common good. Is it any wonder then that families are fracturing and communities are crumbling? And as long as we have folk like Ms Kipnis continuing to undermine everything that is required to make any kind of social relationship work, be it home, the workplace, or democracy, we can only expect to see more shattered societies and alienated individuals.me self-sacrifice, and some humility.

It has been a long wait since the 1995 second edition.<br />Again Longman offers judicious and careful advice on the merits and demerits of a large number of OT commentaries. As with all such comments on the commentaries, there is subjectivism at work, and not all will agree with all of Longman's assessments. After all, how can one say what is the best commentary on, say, Deuteronomy? It really depends on the needs of the reader. A busy pastor may want something more expository and devotional, while the academic may prefer the more technical and scholarly.<br />Thus Longman tries to rate the commentaries by what they set out to do, or what the series they are contained in set out to do. Thus he comes up with recommendations that may differ from others. For example, of the 19 commentaries on 1 and 2 Kings, he gives the highest rating (5 stars) to Iain Provan's volume in the NIBC series. While acknowledging that it is a bit too brief (in keeping with the series), he believes that in terms of accessibility and readability, along with a good balance of literary and theological emphases, this is the best thing going on Kings.<br />Interestingly, David Bauer, in his An Annotated Guide to Biblical Resources for Ministry (Hendrickson, 2003), does not even give Provan's volume a mention, in the 21 books he lists. However, John Glynn in his Commentary and Reference Survey, 9th ed. (Kregel, 2003), does mention it, along with 16 other commentaries.<br />Thus there will always be disagreements in this area, as a lot of differing criteria and measuring sticks are used to make assessments.<br />One omission from this volume is the section on OT reference works and Hebrew helps. They too, like the commentaries, continue to pour forth at an alarming rate. Thus cuts need to be made somewhere.<br />But of the three reference works cited here (the other two cover the NT as well), Longman is my first port of call. Unlike the other two authors, Longman is an OT specialist, with several fine commentaries of his own.<br />Longman mentions in his intro that many people emailed him, urging him to get a revised edition of this work out. I was one of them, and such lobbying has paid off. One hopes to see a 4th edition before another 8 years lapse however!ver the NT as well), Longman is my first port of call.

For over four decades she has championed the cause of faith and family, and has resisted the radical social engineering of radical feminists, the homosexual lobby and other coercive utopians.<br />She is perhaps most famous for almost single-handedly knocking down the feminist Equal Rights Amendment. Her 1964 book on what women really want, A Choice Not an Echo, sold 3 million copies.<br />This volume is a collection of her columns, articles and essays written over the years. Arranged topically, they cover a number of important issues, including affirmative action, women in the military, the importance of marriage and family, women in the workplace, and so on. The offer some of the most insightful and challenging remarks found on these vital issues. Each pithy essay (there are around one hundred) is a minor classic.<br />Take for example her 1987 piece, \\"Why Affirmative Action is Wrong for Women\\". The first two (of seven) reasons are worth citing: First, \\"the woman receiving the benefit is not a woman who was ever discriminated against. The benefits are not targeted for the victims. Nobody should be entitled to receive a remedy for any injury suffered by someone else.\\"<br />Second, \\"it is based on a theory of group rights as opposed to the American tradition of individual rights. Women are not a monolithic, cohesive group in which a grievance suffered by one woman should translate into a right or a remedy granted to another woman.\\"<br />Or consider the so-called glass ceiling. Says Schlafly, \\"Just because there is a small percentage of women in senior management does not prove discrimination. It proves instead that the majority of women have made other choices - usually family choices - rather than devoting themselves to the corporate world for sixty to eighty hours a week.\\"<br />The short essays contained in this book will not take long to read. But they will provide much food for thouht, rattle a few cages, and cause much mirth (depending on where you stand on the issues). With the overwhelming proliferation of the feminist worldview in the media and elsewhere, it is reassuring to know that countering voices still exist.

What does the free-market have to do with the family? What does libertarianism have to do with community? What does the minimal state have to do with social order? Indeed, what does love have to do with economics? Good questions indeed.<br />Those opposed to libertarian principles will of course answer these questions differently from those in favour. But Jennifer Roback Morse offers an interesting third proposal. She notes that attacks on the family have not just come from welfare statism on the left. It has also come from radical individualism on the right. Interestingly, while she is a political and economic libertarian, she is aware of the shortcomings of moral and social libertarianism.<br />Thus she is far from hostile to libertarianism. She is, in fact, a free-market economist. But she is not blind to the short-comings of laissez-faire social policy. Indeed, she believes it to be unworkable. Says Dr Morse, &quot;We cannot afford to take a completely laissez-faire attitude toward the family and the issues that surround it.&quot;<br />So how does a libertarian defend marriage and family? Well, that is what this book is all about. She attempts to show that a genuine libertarianism must be one stripped of its &quot;bankrupt materialism&quot; and must be open in fact to the supernatural. That is, a secular, atheistic society does not contain within itself the ability to long sustain a free people. A free society requires three legs to stand on, as Michael Novak long ago pointed out. It needs economic liberty, political liberty, and moral-cultural liberty. The last, which includes the importance of religion, has too often been ignored in this discussion.<br />A minimalist state is one that depends on a substantial component of its citizenry exercising self-control and self-constraint. People making sacrifices for others, foregoing instant gratification, controlling anti-social desires are what make for a free society. And these kinds of virtues are basically learned and developed in the home, and buttressed by religion.<br />The internalised ethic of love, self-control and cooperation can nowhere better come into being than in the home, where mothers and fathers model such virtues to their children. The cooperation and restraint needed for a society to last is first and foremost found in the home.<br />It is in the home that a naturally selfish and me-centered  child learns the rules of social harmony and cooperation. All of these virtues can be subsumed under the word love. And love, as the author reminds us, is not an emotion or a feeling, but is in fact willing the highest good of another. &quot;Love is the force that moderates self-interest and makes it possible for self-interested people to live together without causing each other too much trouble.&quot;<br />If it is rare for an economists to talk about love, it is even more rare to hear one talk about God. As a Catholic, she knows that in God we have an infinite supply of love accessible to us. &quot;A society of free people requires more human connections, more generosity, and more love than almost any other kind of society we can imagine. Surely the existence of an inexhaustible supply of love, available to anyone for the asking, is of more than passing importance for a society like ours.&quot;<br />But I have so far spoken in generalities. Also found in this book are detailed chapters of the importance of marriage, family and the problems of day care, and other related topics, all backed up with thorough documentation. For example, her chapters on the importance of fathers, or the dilemma of daycare, or the shortcomings of cohabitation, offer good assessments of recent research on those questions.<br />Taken together, here we have major social, economic and philosophical themes addressed with an eye to detail on the public policy connections. And we have a rare blend of a mother's concern for family coupled with the tough analysis of an economist. The result is an informative and an incisive look at some of the most pressing social issues of the day. A welcome volume for all concerned about families and society.informative and an incisive look at some of the most pressing social issues of the day.

How have the forces of modernization and globalization impacted on the institutions of marriage and family? Is the decline of marriage in the Western world inevitable?  What role does religion play in the revitalizing of marriage and family? And how can the fortunes of marriage be reversed in the social, cultural and educational arenas? What models can we look to today which can guide us in our attempt to resurrect the institution of marriage?<br />These and other profound questions are closely explored in this new volume by a leading ethicist and family educator from the Chicago Divinity School. Political, historical, religious and theological disciplines are carefully woven together in this wide-ranging work. The outcome is a renewed call for the importance of marriage in an age that needs to rediscover why it is such a necessary and crucial institution.<br />Browning examines how the family has fared over the millennia, and then uses this historical backdrop to see whether and how modernization and marriage can co-exist. He argues that we cannot turn back the clock, and refutes the concept the marriage is a pre-modern institution, incapable of surviving in a modern and postmodern environment.<br />He points out the now familiar negative impacts of modernization on marriage and family, but also argues that there have been positive benefits as well to arise out of modernization. His thesis is that modernization, at least in its destructive aspects, needs to be curtailed (not eliminated, as if that were possible) while marriage needs to be supported and promoted anew. Somehow the two can and must develop together.<br />Detailed examinations of the family in different cultures and nations is followed by meaty chapters on the findings of evolutionary psychology, feminism and global trends, and theological defences of marriage. For example the place of marriage and the role of fathers in the thinking of Aquinas and Luther are given close attention. Given that the male alienation from families is perhaps the most important social problem of today, this chapter offers insights and wisdom from generations past which shed considerable light on the way we might proceed on these key social questions today.<br />The concluding chapters seek to develop a practical theology of marriage and to examine world family strategies.  He develops his theology of the family mainly from Christian considerations, although drawing on non-Christian resources as well. Catholic and Protestant considerations are investigated, and brief assessments are made of earlier formulations. He also examples various marriage renewal movements and programs found amongst the different denominations.<br />Global strategies to renew the institution of marriage are explored, with their strengths and weaknesses examined. From papal encyclicals of the Catholic church to the work of Allan Carlson and the Howard Center in Illinois, a number of marriage renewal projects are discussed. Common themes are drawn out and elaborated upon, and tentative proposals for the way ahead suggested.<br />Those wanting a &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;problem&quot; of marriage will not find what they are looking for here. The problems are too complex and the situation too diverse to offer a magic pill of reform. At best Browning can only point to wisdom from the past coupled with insights from the present to guide us into the future.<br />But the foundational themes addressed here are the right place to begin: families are essential to the well-being of society; marriage is the centerpiece of strong family life; and all levels of society (governmental, cultural, educational and religious) need to contribute to the defence and promotion of the institution of marriage.marriage and the role of fathers in the thinking of Aquinas and Luther are given close attention.

He has written a number of books using the Socratic method of dialogue and questioning to stimulate thought, correct fuzzy thinking, and challenge our unexamined presuppositions.<br />He is now in the midst of a new series of volumes, entitled Socrates Meets.... The series is designed to help introduce the reader to the major thinkers and their writings. In this book we have Kreeft (via Socrates) analyse and dissect The Communist Manifesto.<br />This book, of course, belongs to that group of books which almost everyone knows about but very few people have actually read. Works by Darwin and Freud could also be mentioned (and one suspects that Kreeft has these authors in the pipeline as well).<br />So it is quite important that someone who actually knows these Great Books quite well can make them accessible and understandable to the average layperson. These volumes do a very good job of distilling the contents and ideas of the Great Books, making them easy to understand and digest. The format of a debate or dialogue between Socrates and his antagonist makes for enjoyable and illuminating reading.<br />Indeed, the format makes the book fun while helping the reader discover discerning and penetrating insights into the subject of the debate. By uniting a Christian worldview with the probing Socratic method, Kreeft is able to clarify an opponent's position, and point out the inconsistencies and fallacies therein. He is then in a position to show the superior claims of the Judeo-Christian position, over against that found in their works.<br />This volume applies solid logic and the timeless truths of the Judeo-Christian tradition to one of the most influential of modern thinkers. It makes for a great introduction to this thinker, as well as an incisive critique of his thoughts. One can only look forward to future volumes in this excellent series.	2003-10-31

Others books have attempted the same. The great English apologist C.S. Lewis wrote a book entitled The Problem of Pain, exploring these difficult questions. It is interesting to compare it with a book he wrote later, after his wife died of cancer. His A Grief Observed does not so much refute what he wrote earlier, but in many ways goes far beyond it.<br />A theoretical and theological reflection of suffering is one thing. A first-hand personal account is another. A Grief Unveiled is of the second type. Not that theological and biblical reflection is absent. But this is the very personal and very moving account of how one father copes with the worst pain imaginable, moments after the event, hours after, days after, months after, and years after. What does the journey of grief look like from the inside? This volume is an unforgettable account of one long and painful trip through grief.<br />For anyone who has experienced any comparable tragedy, the book will echo similar thoughts and emotions, and will bring forth many tears. The book does not over-sentimentalize, but neither does it over-spiritualize. It is brutally honest and totally real.<br />Anyone who suffers will resonate with these moving chapters. Yet it is not just a book about sorrow, grief and pain. It is also a book about hope, joy and victory. It is the story of a radiant faith; a faith that takes a terrible hammering, but a faith the survives and grows and triumphs. But it is triumphant faith because it has as its object a triumphant God. Indeed, God is the real subject of this book in many ways. It is only because of the great love, grace and mercy of God that the Floyds can make it through the valley of the shadow of death.<br />The opening chapters are the most painful. Descriptions of the accident. Cradling a dying boy. The nervous wait at the hospital. The bad news from the doctor. Watching a lifeless boy in a casket, bandages over the eyes, because the organs were donated. The burial. The days immediately thereafter.<br />The grief seems unbearable. But with time comes some relief. The hole in the soul is always there. It will never disappear. But the intense pain and grief slowly, and surely, begin to subside. And through it all, one believer's relationship with his God is sorely tested, but in the end, vindicated. And with it comes the spiritual understanding that comes with the suffering, the realization that the God we serve is a suffering God.<br />God the Father knows all about suffering. He too lost a son in tragic circumstances. And Mary, the mother of Jesus, also knows the heartbreak of losing a beloved son. But as Floyd makes quite clear, Good Friday is followed by Easter Sunday. John-Paul is not dead, but alive, waiting for the glorious reunion that will one day take place. The promise of the resurrection is the believer's hope. And the resurrection of Jesus is the guarantee that we too will one day be raised.<br />But it works both ways, There can be no Easter without Calvary. Suffering is the path chosen by Christ, and it is the path his followers must also accept. The hard questions may never fully be answered. But the ultimate answer to the problem of suffering and evil is not a proposition but a person. Jesus, who is acquainted with grief and familiar with sorrow, is the only one who can offer comfort and hope to those who suffer.<br />If God can take the most horrible and painful event in human history, the cross, and turn it into the most glorious and blessed of events, then there is hope for us as well. Suffering can be redeemed. It can make us more like the one who knows all about suffering.<br />This book is a testament to the way the death of one man two thousand years ago becomes the basis of hope for everyone today. This powerful story will help those who are suffering to make it through. And it will help all of us to get our priorities a little more straight, and help us refocus our attention on what is truly important and of value in life.it through.

The usual wisdom is to say that we just need to try harder to balance work commitments with family responsibilities. But Brian Robertson, a writer living in Washington DC, believes the answers lie elsewhere.<br />Indeed, from a historical perspective, the current crisis is really an anomaly. The modern feminist movement of the 60s taught that the only good woman is a career woman, and that homemaking and motherhood were to be despised and fled from.  But interestingly, the womens movement prior to that fought for the right of a mother to stay at home with her young children, and not be conscripted into the paid workplace.<br />Thus the struggle for those in the earlier years of the womens movement was to protect women from the encroachment of market forces, and to prevent them from being forced into career at the expense of their families. Motherhood and homemaking, in other words, were seen as honorable and valuable ends in themselves.<br />But with the late 60s and onwards, the new wave of feminists took a totally different line: only in the paid workforce can a woman find meaning, freedom and dignity. Thus the vitriolic attack on mothers and the family. Betty Friedan therefore could call the home a \\"comfortable concentration camp\\" while Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown could label a mother and housewife as \\"a parasite, a dependent, a scrounger, a sponger  a bum\\".<br />A womans freedom, said these feminists, meant that a woman should and could be independent both in the economic and the reproductive realms. Women just do not need men, and are better off without them. Establishing a career and gaining financial independence is the first goal of the modern woman. And millions of Western women bought this line of thought.<br />Of course now the inherent contradictions are coming all too clear. Women who were told that they could have it all are now fining that they have very little. They may have a good job, but they have no husband or boyfriend, no children and no family. And many today are deeply regretful of this fact.<br />But it is not just women who have suffered at the hands of feminist orthodoxy. Children have been the big losers. Millions of children today are being raised by strangers. Yet all the social science research shows that children desperately need their mums and dads. No day care system can ever compete with the love and attention of a mother and a father.<br />Yet as Robertson documents, while the social research on all this is quite clear, very few are willing to promote the findings, for fear of incurring the wrath of feminists and of making working mums feel guilty. So although the research is clear, that attachment is important for infants and mother-child bonding is crucial, millions of mothers are ignoring the evidence, and their maternal instincts, and are abandoning their children in droves.<br />The harmful effects of extended periods of time for young children in day care are well documented in this book. Even child care workers admit that they would not dare to leave their own children in day care. Yet many mothers have been so indoctrinated into believing that their needs and desires must come first, that they are offering their children second best.<br />And seeking to alleviate the problems by better day care, more workplace flexibility, or seeking to obtain an unobtainable balance between work and family just is not sufficient. And it is not just short-sighted governments offering these inadequate solutions. The corporate world in effect has bought the feminist myth as well that women can have it all. But the truth is, they cant have it all, at least not at the same time. Thus more corporate day care centres will not solve the bigger problems.<br />Indeed, the corporations are shooting themselves in the foot here. The really productive worker is theworker who has a happy and satisfying home life. But the corporate world, even with generous paid maternity leave policies, cannot stop the hemorrhaging  of the family. Maternal deprivation is harmful to children, and unhappy children make for unhappy families, and unhappy families result in poor workers.<br />Governments also lose, as they seek to press women into the paid workplace, and do not deal with the root causes as to why so many families are forced to have two incomes. By bribing mums into the paid work place, whether by child care subsidies or other financial incentives, the growing problem of falling fertility rates, for example, will only increase. Less people mean less taxable income, and the inability to pay for expensive social welfare programs.<br />Thus both governments and businesses need to radically rethink what family-friendly workplaces actually mean. Robertson concludes by proposing some radical measures to put the interests of families first. These are predicated on the principle that human societies need the traditional family structure with a mother as the principal caregiver. Marriage and family are non-negotiable first principles. If that is accepted, then the following steps can be explored:<br />-Treat families as a unit in the tax code<br />-End \\"no-fault\\" divorce<br />-Replace the current welfare system with one that does not encourage illegitimacy and undermine intact families<br />-Pare back affirmative action legislation and programs<br />-Give all parents, not just those in the paid work place, child care credits or tax breaks.<br />These and other proposals, will help to ensure that real family-friendly policies are pursued. Yet Robertson knows that legal and economic change alone is not enough. The much harder cultural element needs to be addressed. But we have to start somewhere.

US	52661388	R3ROG5K7GQIHYO	1893554155	171289962	Christianity On Trial: Arguments Against Anti-Religious Bigotry	Books	5	18	21	N	Y	A force for good	As the Western world grows increasingly secular, the attacks on religion in general and Christianity in particular become ever more shrill and pronounced. Christianity especially has long been the object of ridicule, criticism and ostracism. Of course much of that is earned. But much is not. This new book looks at some of the major critiques of Christianity, and offers some telling responses.<br />All the usual criticisms are examined in detail: What about the Crusades? Isn't the Bible at odds with science? Didn't Christians support the Nazis? Isn't Christianity sexist, racist, imperialist, etc.? These and other common objections are given careful attention.<br />Consider the case of the Spanish Inquisition. By all accounts, this was nasty business. But a sense of perspective is in order. A careful examination of the historical record reveals that at tops, around 2000 people were executed for heresy by the Inquisition. This is 2000 too many. But this works out to an average of less than 3 people a year during the 16th and 17th centuries. A far cry less than the many millions a year killed in the name of godless communism or ruthless fascism.<br />Similar things can be said about the Salem witch trials. There just were not that many of them. And many of the Christian leaders - Puritans included - were opposed to them. While religious leaders believed in witches, so did everyone else of the day. But it was often ministers who opposed the trials. Cotton Mather went so far as to say it was \\"better that ten suspected witches should escape, than that one innocent person should be condemned\\".<br />Other criticisms of Christianity are covered at length: Christianity leads to environmental degradation, or a suppression of human rights and freedoms. But the criticisms are not the sole focus of this book. In addition, the positive contributions of Christianity to the world are also canvassed. Meaty chapters examine the influence for good which the Christian church has been responsible for over the centuries.<br />One example is the rise of charity and benevolent societies, While charity was practiced on occasion before Christianity arrived on the scene, it became the norm instead of the exception for the new-found faith. More than one cynical critic of the early Christians was forced to admit that these believers practiced what they preached, and were serious about applying the words of their Lord on the issue of wealth and poverty.<br />This could especially be seen when major epidemics broke out, The standard response of the pagans was to flee. The ones who stayed and tended the sick and needy were Christians. This concern for the poor and the afflicted was largely responsible for the tremendous growth of Christianity during its early centuries. Many people converted to Christianity based on the caring and compassionate response of believers in the face of suffering, sickness and death.<br />The authors also examine the issue of the relationship between religion and science. Contrary to popular belief, Christianity has more to do with the spread of knowledge and science than its hindrance. Yes there were times when the church blocked progress in intellectual discovery and scientific enterprise, but they make up the exceptions to the rule. Even many secular thinkers have noted that it was the Christian world view that in so many ways made the rise of modern science possible.<br />The world view of the Roman Empire was syncretistic, fatalistic and superstitious. This made poor ground for scientific inquiry to grow and flourish in. However, the biblical Christian worldview was much more conducive to scientific progress.<br />For example, the cyclical view of history of pagan Rome was replaced by the linear conception of history in Christianity. Christians believed in a orderly, purposeful world which had a sense of direction and meaning, something which the scientific mind could tap into and explore. A perspective which viewed the world with purpose and meaning waiting to be discovered was much different than a fatalistic and cyclical view of history which offered little incentive to those who were scientifically motivated.<br />True, scientific advance did take root in two other cultures: the Islamic world and China. But in both the efforts stalled, and it was only in the Christianised West that science continued to develop. Bear in mind, for example, that it was Western technology and know-how that discovered and utilised the oil that sat for millennia in Middle Eastern (Muslim) deserts.<br />Other achievements of Christianity are covered, including the relationship between Christianity and Western democracy, and the struggle against slavery. All in all, the Christian religion has been a force of tremendous good in the world. Yes, it has contributed its share of misery and grief, but one can argue that these blemishes are not inherent in New Testament Christianity, but in its perversion.<br />Attacks on the Christian religion will continue. But many of the standard objections to the faith turn out, on closer inspection, to be not so damaging at all. Often, they are based on misinformation or selective use of the historical record. Despite its many shortcomings, the Christian religion has much to be proud of; the \\"overlooked side of the ledger\\" as the authors put it.<br />In sum, the world is a better place because of Christianity. Were it not for the Christian religion, the world during the past two millennia would arguably have been \\"crueler, poorer and more provincial, as well as less democratic, creative and informed - in a word, less civilised\\". This book makes this case dispassionately but convincingly.ith purpose and meaning waiting to be discovered was much different than a fatalistic and cyclical view of history which offered little incentive to those who were scientifically motivated.<br />True, scientific advance did take root in two other cultures: the Islamic world and China.

US	52661388	R1YSNGYIXS2LIW	1893554554	303973284	Life Liberty & the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics	Books	5	34	38	N	Y	Excellent analysis	The rapid growth in biotechnology has seen a corresponding growth in bioethics. Unfortunately, however, many bio-ethicists have become handmaidens to Big Biotech. The twin towers of technology and money have led many to abandon genuine independent ethical reflection. There have been too few  voices to assess the latest trends in biotechnology in a wise, discerning and prudent manner.<br />One person who has done so is biologist and philosopher Leon Kass of the University of Chicago. He has spend a lifetime thinking about, and writing on, the new reproductive technologies and the challenges they present. And he has done so always with a view to the implications for human dignity and freedom. This volume, which includes articles which have appeared elsewhere, contains of wealth of information and ethical reflection on the new technologies.<br />All the major issues are covered here: cloning and stem cell research, IVF and assisted reproductive technologies, the new genetics, euthanasia and end of life decisions, and other recent developments in biotechnology.<br />Also carefully discussed are the hard questions: What is the moral status of the human embryo? Should there be limits to where we are heading in biology and technology? Are there areas of mystery in life that science should simply leave alone? Should autonomy, and the modern concept of human rights, trump other social and community concerns? What is the nature of medicine and what are its goals? These and other important ethical concerns are all given wise and careful consideration.<br />Kass examines the relationship between liberal democracies and the new technologies, for example, offering incisive and cautious reflection. He notes how democracies help create a climate which makes possible the growth of science and technology. But he also warns that without a moral vision of how that technology should proceed, there is the danger of commercial interests and utopian schemes derailing the science into undemocratic ends.<br />Indeed, since the time of the Enlightenment, an overly rationalist and utopian dream of the perfectibility of man has been pursued, often with disastrous consequences. Only by continually affirming the mystery and sacredness of life, and the dignity and wonder of man, can we prevent such coercive utopianism.<br />However, as Kass so clearly points out, the real threat is not coercive utopianism, but well-intentioned utopianism. That is, the real dangers come from those who speak of compassion, the relief of suffering and the battle for immortality. Says Kass, \\"the benevolent uses of humanitarian technologies often have serious unintended and undesired consequences.\\" The promises of the relief of all suffering and the extension of life may sound pleasing to the ears, but can in fact bring bitterness to the soul.<br />Lost in the discussions of overcoming all problems and eradicating all unhealthiness, is the concept of the human person, of human dignity. To what end should we strive for immortality? What benefit will it be if we can live longer but not better lives? It is living well, not just living longer, that should preoccupy our minds and dreams. Yet the modern quest for perfection rarely addresses those more important concerns. Indeed, the modern rationalistic and secular march of science and technology often deliberately eschews any moral or religious considerations.<br />The whole problem of designer babies is another outcome of the new technologies. We now have the power to determine in advance how a baby can and should  live. We not only have the power to change an individual's life through the new genetics, but generations to come. And with the new genetic medicine comes the power to decide who will live and who will die.<br />As we redefine a human being in terms of his or her genes, we run the risk of \\"justifying death solely for genetic sins\\". Genetic reductionism makes it easier, not harder, to allow experts and scientists to make the difficult choices of who is allowed to live. Eugenics, even if done with the best of intentions, is still eugenics. And the new eugenics is not so easily discerned, when it comes hidden behind a white lab coat or in an attractive fertility clinic.<br />The pressure of science and Big Biotech to simply do whatever can be done, without asking whether it should be done, will only continue. Especially when sold in the guise of relieving suffering, or offering more lifestyle choices. We have, as Kass says, the \\"biomedical equivalent of a spiraling arms race\\" where research and technology seem to know no limits. The consequences are frightening.<br />Kass concludes by acknowledging that he is not a Luddite, that there has been much good to come from the new technologies. But there is much to fear as well, especially if our scientific advances are not coupled with moral and spiritual growth. A perfect body, with a hole in the soul, may not be progress, but an unspeakable regress.<br />Which way the future unfolds is an open question at this point. The future in many ways is up to us. Do we allow a future with dignity and freedom, or do we passively accept the dehumanisation and depersonalisation that comes with unbridled scientific advance? The important warnings offered here need to be read and heeded, if we are to advance on the right course.e difficult choices of who is allowed to live.

He is also one of the most prolific, with well over sixty titles to his name. In this volume he teams up with a former Muslin to present one of the most detailed, scholarly and up-to-date-assessments of Islam yet offered by the Christianity community.<br />Answering Islam is a thorough examination of the major teachings and beliefs of Islam. The book is comprised of three main sections. The first deals with the various core teachings of Islam: the Koran, the place of Muhammed, the Muslim's view of man and salvation, and the doctrine of God (Allah).<br />A number of issues are dealt with in these opening chapters, including the place of prophets in Islam, the Muslim concept of creation, the place of Christ in Islamic thinking, and the nature of eschatology in Islam. Were the book to finish here, the reader would have been treated to a wealth of information and insight into Muslim beliefs.<br />But the second section takes us much further, offering an in-depth Christian assessment of some of these doctrines. Three subjects are given extensive treatment: the nature of Islamic monotheism, the person of Muhammed, and the claims of the Koran.<br />Concerning strict Muslim monotheism, a number of issues are covered. The unity of Allah is closely examined, as is the notion of divine sovereignty. The authors show that Allah lacks the personal, loving nature which the God of Judeo-Christian beliefs presents. Instead Allah is seen as harsh, authoritarian and utterly transcendent. Muslims know nothing of the personal intimacy which Christians have with their Lord. Yes, the God of the Bible is transcendent, but he is also immanent as well, making him one to both fear and love simultaneously.<br />And the utterly deterministic nature of Allah makes any concept of personal freedom and responsibility difficult to maintain in orthodox Islam. The extreme fatalism and strict determinism found in Islam result in a master-slave relationship, instead of the close friendship which Christians can enjoy with their God.<br />The chapter on Muhammed is equally revealing and incisive. The authors carefully assess his character, his claims to miracles, and his concept of prophethood. And the chapter on the Koran looks at its claims to being divinely inspired. But the supporting credentials are just not there, argue the authors.<br />Finally, the third major section of the book offers a positive defense of key Christian doctrines: the deity of Christ, the Trinity, salvation, and Biblical authority. As these are main stumbling blocks for Muslims, the authors present a detailed defense of these biblical concepts, interacting with Muslim misunderstandings along the way.<br />On top of all this, there are 6 extensive appendices on such issues as Muslim religious practices, Muslim sects and movements, and Muslim attacks on the New Testament. But most readers will race to Appendix 5, \\"Islam and Violence\\".<br />In the wake of September 11, many will want to know if Muslim militancy is an integral part of Islam or an aberration of it. The authors provide a close inspection of the concept of jihad, or holy war. The authors contend that there are plenty of Koranic texts which appear to justify acts of violence and aggression. Indeed, it seems to be an essential feature of Islamic teaching, as found in the Koran and the hadith, or oral tradition of Islam. Both lend support for armed attacks on non-believers.<br />The authors point out that such justification for holy war is not comparable with what appears to be the Old Testament equivalent. This order to fight was limited in both time and place, while the Islamic version appears to be universal and timeless. Warfare in the New Testament is clearly spiritual in nature, and church and state have their separate spheres (\\"Render onto Caesar...\\"). But Islam knows no such distinction. Thus political power and religious authority are seen as one by most Muslims. Here, and in many other areas, Islam differs radically from the Christian faith.<br />In an age which appears to see all religions as being largely the same, and in a culture where Political Correctness reigns supreme, it is hard to make theological and ethical distinctions. But that we must do, and this book helps us to do just that in regard to the two main religious movements of our day. Many other good books exist which evaluate Islam from a Christian perspective. However, if you can afford only one, this should be your choice.ms.

This brief volume (110 pages) seeks to make that case.<br />In this book, Dyck, a Population Ethics professor at Harvard university, examines the various legal and philosophical arguments thrown up in favor of physician-assisted suicide (PAS), assesses different types of treatment available for the suffering and terminally ill, establishes the religious and moral framework which upholds the sanctity of life, and concludes with a look at Christian concerns over sickness and dying.<br />On the philosophical front, Dyck details recent defenses of PAC, and shows how major moral and philosophical shifts have taken place to allow such defenses to take root and flourish. A major shift in how we view human nature undergirds much of the euthanasia debate today. That is, we have shifted from an emphasis on the sacredness of human life to autonomy as the highest good.<br />For example, thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke and Kant understood human nature as including a strong sense of self-preservation, not just of the species, but of one's self. Mill, on the other hand, adopted an autonomous hedonism: self-happiness is the goal, regardless of how that is played out. Unfortunately, the thinking of Mill and others has tended to win out over the traditional view.<br />That, coupled with the rise of secularism and the collapse of religion, has led to a quality of life ethic replacing the sanctity of life ethic. These differing views of human nature and the social good underlie the differences found in the euthanasia debate today.<br />These differences take practical expression when we decide whether to utilise palliative care or simply administer a lethal injection. The two different actions reflect two different views of humanity. Dyck's second chapter examines the moral differences between comfort-only care and PAS. While there may be some overlap (pain relief can hasten death), the two are quite different in moral terms.<br />A major difference has to do with intent. What is the primary goal: to preserve life, or to end it? A lethal agent is introduced into the latter, making it ethically very different indeed.<br />Chapter three deals with moral rights and human right in the PAS debate. Traditionally it was held that we all have a moral responsibility to preserve life - others and our own. Suicide (and PAS) thus was seen as an abrogation of that central moral responsibility. Counter-arguments about autonomy and freedom of choice do not however curtail that responsibility, argues Dyck. The over-emphasis on choice and freedom may sound good, but it often leads to disastrous outcomes.<br />That is, what a society allows intellectually, and more importantly, legally, will impact on how individuals respond to those conditions. One study found, for example, that not one AIDS patients in England who wanted to end their life did so, while 30 % did in the Netherlands. The reason? PAS is illegal in England and hospice care widely available, while the exact reverse is true in Holland. So those who wish to legalise PAS will inevitably see a rise is such cases. Bad thinking leads to bad laws which leads to bad outcomes.<br />The better way is to show real compassion to the sick and dying, instead of wishing them a speedy exit. Dyke concludes this volume with a look at how Christian beliefs and practices are the best response to suffering and death.<br />The Christian world view has always had a high view of human life and its inherent dignity. This shows through in many ways, from missions of mercy to the establishment of hospice care. Indeed, both hospitals and palliative care largely spring from Christian roots.<br />Genuine compassion treats all life with respect and dignity, and does not judge life on the basis of functionality or usefulness. It is the harder, more difficult path to follow, but is the more loving and just path.<br />The transformation of our thinking on human worth is accelerating apace. So too are the corresponding calls for PAS and a host of other anti-life initiatives. Calls to legalise euthanasia will only become louder and more frequent. Those who seek to uphold the sanctity of life need to be ready for these challenges. Becoming informed about the euthanasia debate is part of the preparation. This important volume will help greatly in that task.The transformation of our thinking on human worth is accelerating apace.

In 1983 he wrote The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion (Inter-varsity Press). Indeed, abortion featured partially in other works, such as A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews With an Absolutist (Ignatius Press, 1999).<br />But as Kreeft says, abortion continues to be \\"the most divisive public issue of our time\\". Thus another look at the subject is in order.<br />This volume, as the title indicates, is divided into three main sections. The first offers a philosophical argument against abortion. The second affirms pro-lifers as to why the debate is important and why they must continue in the battle. The third deals with objections from the pro-abortion side.<br />Part one of this book makes the philosophical case against abortion. Philosophical argumentation can be quite technical and convoluted, involving multiple steps, seeking the validity of an argument or the soundness of a premise. And Kreeft is a philosopher. But most people are not. Thus it is the task of Kreeft to take relatively complex concepts in logic and philosophy and make them understandable to the common reader. This he does quite well.<br />Generally any philosophical argument takes some amount of time to elaborate. Kreeft's 15 points take some 30 pages to unfold. But the are easy to understand and flow easily one to the other. Professional philosophers may demure, saying the argument is too simplistic, makes too many assumptions, or is not carefully nuanced enough. Possibly, yes. But Kreeft does seek to cover all the bases, and he deliberately has chosen not to go down the technical path.<br />The fifteen steps perhaps can be boiled down to several propositions:<br />-human rights are based on the condition of human reality (the nature of who we are)<br />-morality is based on higher law, or metaphysics<br />-metaphysics, not might, should determine morality<br />-morality (rights) should extend to all persons, not just some<br />-if we are unsure if the unborn are persons, then we should not abort them<br />If that does not seem like much of an argument, read the 30 pages and see how he carefully weaves his case together.<br />Part two of the book is meant to rally the troops to not give up on this vital issue. It makes clear why the debate is so important, and how it in many ways impacts of so many other crucial issues. Many areas, such as family, society, sexuality, human meaning and purpose, and even human survival, are impacted by the way we think about, and legislate on, abortion. If we give up on defending the rights of the unborn, we have given way a  huge amount of moral ground. To surrender here opens up all kinds of other abuses of human rights.<br />Part three of the book takes on many of the common objections raised by the pro-abortion camp. It comes in the form of a dialogue between Kreeft and an opponent, a format Kreeft has successfully used in many of his earlier books. Engaging, witty and intellectually cogent, the argument made provides much useful information to the pro-life side.<br />The overall effect of these three sections is a strongly and tightly argued case for the protection of unborn life, and a refutation of many of the pro-abortion positions. While the book is written for people in both camps, one assumes it will mainly be read by like-minded thinkers. However, those on the other side who want to approach the issue with an open mind will find much to think about here, and perhaps even a few may find themselves changing their minds.mine morality<BR>-morality (rights) should extend to all persons, not just some<BR>-if we are unsure if the unborn are persons, then we should not abort them<br />If that does not seem like much of an argument, read the 30 pages and see how he carefully weaves his case together.<br />Part two of the book is meant to rally the troops to not give up on this vital issue.

However, those on the other side who want to approach the issue with an open mind will find much to think about here, and perhaps even a few may find themselves changing their minds.	2003-02-14
US	52661388	R23XJ5D2T99UEP	0802837387	432058831	The Letters to the Thessalonians (The Pillar New Testament Commentary (PNTC))	Books	5	76	77	N	N	Top Quality	While there have been a number of good commentaries produced on Thessalonians over the years, there have been no quite recent works of substance. Somewhat older evangelical standards include Morris (NIC, 1959), Bruce (WBC, 1982), and Wanamaker (NIGTC, 1990). Thus this new volume is a welcome, and long-overdue, addition.<br />It is quite new (2002) and part of the Pillar Commentary series; a series that did not originally start out as a series. The series now contains eight volumes, of which this is the most recent. New Testament scholar D.A. Carson is editor of the series, so readers can expect these volumes to be of consistently high quality. Indeed, there are no \\"duds\\" to be found in the first seven volumes.<br />The author, Gene Green, teaches New Testament at Wheaton College in Chicago. He has produced a very readable and reliable commentary on the two Thessalonian letters.<br />Green is well abreast of all the latest concerns: theological, historical and textual. Yet in keeping with the aim of the series, the volume is not overly technical. Theological disputes, textual considerations, and social/historical background discussions are all given due attention, but none in overbearing detail. This means all the volumes of this series are quite helpful to pastors and lay people, but will also well serve the academic and scholarly community.<br />This newest edition looks to be of equal value to previous volumes. The extensive bibliography is followed by a thorough introduction, The book is especially helpful in setting forth the letters in their historical and cultural backgrounds. And theologically disputed passages are given fair treatment, with various options presented.<br />And the author is not afraid to take sides on some of these contentious issues. As an example,  those who see a pre-trib rapture in 1 Th 4:16-17 will not find their views confirmed here. Green argues that this passage is not \\"the stuff of speculative prophecy or best-sellers on the end-times\\". The context of this passage makes clear that Paul (whom Green takes to be the author) is seeking to comfort and give hope to believers, especially in relation to those who have already died.<br />Similarly, favorite texts found in 2 Thessalonians by those with sharply held eschatological viewpoints will be treated in differing ways by Green. While not all will agree with each of his interpretations, he backs them all up with thorough research and exegesis, and with even-handedness and a charitable spirit.<br />All in all this is one of the best works now available on the epistles from an evangelical perspective, One eagerly awaits more works by Green, and more volumes in the Pillar series.s\\".

And there have been many fine NT theologies as well. Volumes by Ladd, Caird and Guthrie, among others, have served the Evangelical community well.<br />This new volume offers a bit of both worlds: introductory matters, as well as theological concerns. Written for students and lay people, it will serve as a good intermediary text. Advanced students may find it wanting in areas, but it does offer, if in brief form, some of the latest scholarship on the NT.<br />The three authors all teach interpretation at American seminaries. They have all produced a number of outstanding works on aspects of the NT. Green for example has authored the well received New International Commentary on Luke; Meye Thompson wrote on 1-3 John for the IVP New Testament Commentary Series, and Achtemeier did the Hermeneia commentary on 1 Peter.<br />This volume is especially good on Jesus and the Gospels. Indeed, along with sections on introductory matters and Acts, it takes up the first half of the book. The remainder of the book offers brief chapters on the other 22 books of the New testament. Each chapter concludes with a short bibliography of recent works, usually half of which are commentaries.<br />The chapters highlight the usual concerns: matters of authorship and historical setting, theological themes and literary issues. Photos, maps and supplementary text blocks all contribute to a highly usable and informative volume.<br />The study is neither too technical nor too detailed to be lost on a lay person or beginning student. Yet it is scholarly and up-to-date enough to be of use to more advanced students as well. As with all theological works, there will be some areas of disagreement.<br />For example, since none of the three authors comes from a Reformed perspective (not that they need to), there are areas in which one might beg to differ. Perhaps the most obvious example of this arises in the chapter on Romans. One passage in which quite a lot of ink has been spilled is Romans 7 and the identity of the \\"I\\" who struggles with sin.<br />While a number of options present themselves, many argue that Paul is describing his own experience as a  believer (and by implication that of all other believers). Pick up any 10 good commentaries on Romans, and perhaps as many as half will argue this position Yet in this volume the authors simply dismiss such an interpretation as \\"impossible\\".<br />One would have thought that careful scholars such as Cranfield, Murray, and Dunn, for example, would not embark upon such impossible hermeneutical assignments!<br />But leaving aside the occasional theological quibble, this volume well serves its purpose as an introductory text on basic NT matters. Others may go into more background detail (such as the volume by Carson, Moo and Morris, or more fully examine the theological or literary aspects (Ladd, or Caird - in addition to his NT Theology, see his invaluable Language and Imagery of the Bible), but this volume will fill a niche and should enjoy a long run with students of the NT.eas in which one might beg to differ.

Late in 2001 he announced the formation of a bioethics council to weigh into the many related issues involved in the cloning debate. Chaired by bioethicist Leon Kass of the University of Chicago, a panel of experts was quickly convened, and after 6 months of research and reflection, this final report was presented to the President in July 2002.<br />This 350-page book presents the findings of the Council. The Council was comprised of 18 experts in science, medicine, public policy and ethics. Some were secular, some religious. Some were fully against any form of human cloning - even for research purposes - while others were much more open to therapeutic research involving embryos, whether deliberately created for that purpose, or \\"surplus\\" from assisted reproduction programs. The majority however seem quite concerned about all types of human cloning.<br />The report begins with an overview of the debate, including scientific, historical and ethical components. Terminology is also clearly defined. Then the pros and cons of the ethics of reproductive cloning are examined in detailed. Similarly, the ethics of therapeutic cloning, both for and against, are closely discussed.<br />The book concludes with public policy options and recommendations. Finally, thirteen Council members contribute personal statements on the proceedings. These include William Hurlbut, Charles Krauthammer, Gilbert Meilaender and William May. In these statements the various authors are allowed to express personal preferences, disagreements, or endorsements of the Council report. Many of these alone are worth the price of the book.<br />But as I mentioned, the great majority of Council members seem to have a strong ethical basis on which they make their pronouncements. Thus the report, while allowing various sides to be heard, often gives room for extensive moral reasoning and reflection.<br />For example, in the discussion on cloning for research, the Council acknowledges that we should not ignore the needs of the suffering, but even this must be kept in balance: \\"the relief of suffering, though a great good, is not the greatest good\\". It continues, \\"As highly as we value health and longer life, we know that life itself loses its value if we care only for how long we live, and not also for how we live.\\"<br />On the issue of the moral status of the human embryo, again, differing points of view are expressed. But it does deserve special respect, and should not be treated as a means to another's end. It is more than a clump of cells, and it clearly is the means by which all of us began. The report recommends that all embryo research be subject to a new and thorough review and be part of a larger regulatory scheme.<br />Because this report is a collection of viewpoints, and an assemblage of differing options and proposals, it cannot come out with clear-cut and definite conclusions. But the overall direction and tone of the report is one of balance, prudence and caution. It realises the limitations of science and medicine, and recognises the importance of a comprehensive ethical underpinning of any discussion on the issue. It thus makes for an important contribution to the overall debate.r />For example, in the discussion on cloning for research, the Council acknowledges that we should not ignore the needs of the suffering, but even this must be kept in balance: \\"the relief of suffering, though a great good, is not the greatest good\\".

He has written many influential books, and is in many ways a Catholic version of C.S. Lewis. That is, he is an indefatigable apologist for the Christian faith in an increasingly hostile and secular environment.<br />In his newest book, Kreeft engages in a forceful, almost emotional, assault on the cultural decline everywhere apparent in the West. In many ways this is a more popular and polemic approach than is found in his previous books, However, given the urgency and importance of the matter, he may be right to use such an approach.<br />He wastes no time in laying out his brief. We are at war, he argues, The soul of the West is being fought over, and it doesn't look good for our side. But knowing that we are at war is the first prerequisite for winning it. As such, we need to enter into a wartime consciousness, and get our priorities right. We need to give up our trivial pursuits and get involved in this life or death struggle.<br />Of course Kreeft realises that this is not just a battle against flesh and blood (or governments and cultures). It is ultimately a spiritual battle, and the most effective weapon is saints - believers who have decided to represent Christ fully in a dark and ungodly age. And saints always go into the \\"moral ghettos\\", be they Moses or Christ. \\"Saints are society's white corpuscles, society's saviors\\" he says. \\"If nobody wants to crucify you, you're not doing your job. Or else your job isn't his work.\\"<br />Thus the fight is ultimately about which will prevail: secularism or faith. Kreeft argues that secularism is a doomed philosophy, and that no secular society has survived for more than 72 years (the former USSR being our best test case to date). Indeed, Western societies seem to have contracted \\"moral AIDS\\". We are self-destructing quickly, and the only hope is to reclaim a spiritual and moral vision for the West.<br />While the battle is ultimately spiritual, it does manifest itself in society and culture. And secular ideas and values are penetrating the West with horrific results. Cultural and intellectual poison is steadily destroying our culture. As Kreeft remarks, the most powerful forces in the West today are not church and state but Hollywood and Harvard. Popular culture and academia have been setting the agenda, while the faithful have been marginalised.<br />But it is time to reclaim lost territory, argues Kreeft. And forget about those who argue we are just trying to turn back the clock: \\"You can turn a clock back, both literally and figuratively. And you'd better, if the clock is keeping bad time.\\"<br />We need to re-proclaim values and absolutes in a society that despises both. And we need to go even further, and reclaim conscience. Relativism, the new tolerance, the sexual revolution, and moral apathy have all combined to kill conscience.<br />And this can only lead to worse consequences. As Charles Colson has shown, the only two means we have to prevent community from sliding into chaos are cops and conscience. And when conscience is destroyed, that leaves only cops to stem the tide.  A police state becomes the inevitable outcome. Thus our moral relativism is leading us in a dangerous direction.<br />Many defenders of democracy have noted this tension. For a democracy to work properly, a strong moral populace is needed. Yet a democracy tends to produce moral permissiveness, undermining its very foundations. Thus less conscience results in more cops, leading to the end of democracy.<br />This is the dilemma or paradox of democracy. And history offers us many examples of how this works out in a society. The longest-lasting societies have been the most moralistic, be they Jewish, Confucian, Islamic or Roman. Our recent secular societies however appear to be rather short-lived, whether fascist or Marxist.<br />The sexual revolution is perhaps the most important component of cultural decline. Kreeft argues that we cannot win the culture war unless we win the sex war, because \\"sex is the effective religion of our culture\\". This includes the whole array of battle fronts: pornography, homosexuality, easy divorce and abortion.<br />And to the extent that the church has also compromised in these areas, the culture war will be even more difficult to fight. Yet fight we must. We are called, not to live an easy life, but to take up our cross and follow our Master. The battle can be won, but only if we take our calling seriously and get involved. This book is a timely reminder to do just that.ot win the culture war unless we win the sex war, because \\"sex is the effective religion of our culture\\".

While some of the essays here were penned before that tragedy, all deal with the rise of Muslim militancy, and how the West should respond.<br />Pipes begins by arguing that militant Muslims, or Islamists, do not represent all followers of Islam. The good news is they only comprise, at tops, fifteen per cent of the total. The bad news is, with one billion Muslims, 150 million are extremists. It is the Islamists that are the real threat, says Pipes, not traditional Muslims.<br />Pipes provides the historical backdrop for this new militancy. For their first six centuries, Muslims enjoyed huge success. By the 13th century however decline set in, and for the next six centuries they found themselves heading to the bottom of world affairs, as power and wealth slowly ebbed away. The loss of their golden age, and their sense of alienation and frustration resulted in three recent responses.<br />Secularism, the first response, is seen in countries such as Turkey. The second option, reformism, meant trying to live with the West. The third option, Islamism, is the focus of this book. Militant Islam seeks to reclaim its golden age, wants the total imposition of Shari'a law, and rejects completely Western influences.<br />Pipes shows that Islamism is in fact a radical, utopian ideology, of the same mould as Marxism-Leninism or fascism. It is totalitarian in nature, and seeks salvation in political power, not individual religion. Whenever Islamists take power, as in Iran, Sudan and Afghanistan, a bloody tyranny results.<br />Pipes argues that most traditional Muslims disagree with the premises of the Islamists. This is reflected in part by the fact that often traditional Muslims are the main victims of militant Islam. Algeria is a good case in point, with tens of thousands of Algerians killed (compared to some 80 foreigners).<br />Since its ascendancy almost three decades ago, Islamism has become they main threat to freedom and democracy. It seeks global hegemony, just as past ideologies did. Fueled by fanaticism and hatred, militant Islam has become the new focus of evil in the world.<br />There are two main ways in which Islamists can achieve their goal of world dominion: revolution or integration. The latter comes in the form of immigration to the West, high birth rates, and conversion. All three means are resulting in rising Muslim populations in most Western nations.<br />The other option, bloody struggle, is something the West is becoming all too familiar with. Suicide bombers and terrorist cells are active around the world, and this threat is one all Western governments must come to terms with. Indeed, Pipes shows how militant Islam has been targeting Americans well before September 11.<br />Pipes sees some hope, however. Muslim unity has often been seen as an oxymoron, with the Iraq-Iran conflict being but one example. Another issue is how moderate Islam deals with the threat. If modernism is embraced and Western values are seen as compatible with Islam, then the fanatical arm may be contained. But it is by no means clear in which direction the majority of Muslims will move in the future. It is Muslims themselves, argues Pipes, not the West, who will determine the outcome of this post-Cold War ideological battle.<br />Pipes also writes about Muslims living in the US. There may be 2 or 3 million of them there. Pipes argues that on every front, the US is doing all it can to be hospitable to Muslims. There is a de facto affirmative action mentality in place, with schools, governments, the media, even the military, all fearful of showing any disrespect for Muslims.<br />Tolerance and respect of course are in order, argues Pipes, but in many ways Muslims are being given preferential treatment, so much so that the US government has become \\"a discreet missionary for the faith. Without anyone quite realizing it, the resources of the federal government have been deployed to help Muslims spread their message.\\" Pipes documents numerous examples of just how this is in fact happening.<br />Pipes argues that if Islamists get their way in Western nations, freedom of speech concerning Islam and militant Islam would all but cease. It is becoming increasingly difficult to say anything which might be regarded as critical of Islam.<br />Pipes briefly examines the question of whether Islamism and jihad are an integral part of Islam, or a distortion of it. He recognises that Islam, like all great religions, is made up of different schools and is subject to varieties of interpretation, \\"from the mystical to the militant, from the quietist to the revolutionary. Its most basic ideas have been susceptible of highly contrasting explications.\\"<br />Thus Pipes sees a battle for the soul of Islam being waged, with moderates and militants competing for dominance. But he sees terroristic jihad against the West as but \\"one reading of Islam ... not the eternal essence of Islam\\".<br />He argues that if half the population of the Muslim world hates America, the other half does not. It is to these more moderate Muslims that the West must work with, along with its own Muslim populations, to see that the radical Islamists do not prevail. The struggle will be long and difficult, says Pipes, but an Islamist victory is by no means certain.rnment have been deployed to help Muslims spread their message.\\" Pipes documents numerous examples of just how this is in fact happening.<br />Pipes argues that if Islamists get their way in Western nations, freedom of speech concerning Islam and militant Islam would all but cease.

He shows how Jesus has the power to transform men, who in turn are able to transform society. And on every level, that is exactly what has happened. Several specific examples can be mentioned.<br />In spite the claims of some today that Christianity oppresses women, the historical record shows just the opposite. Women were oppressed in almost every culture prior to the coming of Christianity. By elevating sexual morality, and by conferring upon women a much higher status, the Christian religion revolutionised the place and prestige of women.<br />The way Jesus treated women was in stark contrast to the surrounding culture. In Roman law a man's wife and children were little more than slaves, often treated like animals. Women had no property rights and faced severe social restrictions. Jesus of course changed all that. The way he treated the Samaritan woman was one remarkable example. And this was not lost on the early disciples. We know from the New Testament documents that many women exercised various leadership roles in the early church. Indeed, during this period Christian women actually outnumbered Christian men.<br />Admittedly there were some anomalies later in the church's history, when chauvinistic and anti-feminine views were allowed to re-enter parts of the church. But such aberrations must not detract from the truly revolutionary elevation of the status of women achieved by Christianity.<br />Consider also the issue of health care. Prior to Christianity, the Greeks and Romans had little or no interest in the poor, the sick and the dying. But the early Christians, following the example of their master, ministered to the needs of the whole person. Soon thereafter the institutonalisation of health care began in earnest.<br />For example, the first ecumenical council at Nicea in 325 directed bishops to establish hospices in every city that had a cathedral. The first hospital was built by St Basil in Caesarea in 369. By the Middle Ages hospitals covered all of Europe and even beyond. In fact, \\"Christian hospitals were the world's first voluntary charitable institutions\\".<br />Care for the mentally ill was also a Christian initiative. Nursing also sprang from Christian concerns for the sick, and many Christians have given their lives to such tasks. One thinks of Florence Nightingale, for example, and the formation of the Red Cross.<br />Education, while important in Greek and Roman culture, really took off institutionally under the influence of Christianity. The early Greeks and Romans had no public libraries or educational institutions - it was Christianity that established these. As discipleship was important for the first believers (and those to follow), early formal education arose from Christian catechetical schools. Unique to Christian education was the teaching of both sexes.<br />Also a Christian distinctive, individuals from all social and ethnic groups were included. There was no bias based on ethnicity or class. And the concept of public education first came from the Protestant Reformers. Moreover, the rise of the modern university is largely the result of Christian educational endeavors.<br />As another example of the Christian influence, consider the issue of work and economic life. The Greeks and Romans had a very low view of manual labor, and so it was mainly the slaves and lower classes that were forced to toil with their hands. The non-slave population lived chiefly for personal pleasure. In these early cultures slaves usually greatly outnumbered freemen.<br />Thus there was no such thing as the dignity of labor in these cultures, and economic freedom was only for a select few. The early church changed all this. Jesus of course was a carpenter's son. Paul was a tentmaker. And the early admonition, \\"If a man will not work, he shall not eat\\" was taken seriously by the early believers. Thus work was seen as an honorable and God-given calling. Laziness and idleness were seen as sinful.<br />The idea of labor as a calling, and the idea spoken by Jesus that the laborer is worthy of his wages, revolutionised the workplace. The dignity of labor, the value of hard work, and the sense of vocation, soon changed the surrounding society; the development of a middle class being one of the outcomes. The development of unions is another result. Indeed, the works of Weber and Tawney, among others, records the profound effect the Protestant Reformation has had on work and modern capitalism..<br />Other impacts can be noted. The commandment against stealing of course redefined the concept of private property and property rights. And the protection of workers and workers' rights also flows directly from the biblical worldview. The early unionists were Christians, and concerns for social justice in the workplace and beyond derive from the Judeo-Christian tradition.<br />Other great achievements might be mentioned. The Western political experience, including genuine democracy at all levels of society, equality, human rights and various freedoms, all stem from the Christian religion, along with its Hebrew forebear. The rise of modern science has been directly linked with the biblical understanding of the world. The many great achievements in art, literature and music also deserve mention. For example, how much poorer would the world be without the Christian artistry of da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Bach, Handel, Brahms, Dante, Milton, Bunyan, and countless others?<br />The bottom line, as Schmidt notes, is that if Jesus Christ had never been born, to speak of Western civilisation would be incomprehensible. Indeed, there may never have been such a civilisation. The freedoms and benefits we enjoy in many modern cultures are directly due to the influence of this one man. Schmidt deserves an enormous amount of gratitude for this sterling collection of information and inspiration. Christians have made many mistakes.

The Australian Family Association took out the ad because Peter Singer was running as a Green Senate candidate. Fortunately for the unborn, the newborn, the elderly and many other \\"non-persons\\", Singer received only a tiny fraction of the vote.<br />He now teaches at Princeton University, after a long career at Melbourne's Monash University. He has written over twenty books, and is regarded as a leading contemporary philosopher and bioethicist. He is famous for his advocacy of animal liberation, as well as for his callous view of human life.<br />This new book, edited by an ethicist at Melbourne's Ridley College, contains five important articles offering a critical assessment of Singer's philosophy and writings.<br />After an incisive introduction, Preece offers a close look at the man and his work in chapter one. While recognising the relative consistency throughout his writings, he points out the well-known inconsistency of his regard for his mother has she wrestled with Alzheimer's disease. He rightly notes that on the basis of Singer's utilitarian and consequentialist outlook, he should have bumped off his own mother. But fortunately for his mother, \\"Singer is a better son and person than ethicist\\".<br />He shows how his univeralised utility calculations are really a secualrised version of the parable of the good Samaritan. But without the moral and theological framework which underlies the parable of Jesus, his system is not sustainable. Indeed, because Singer makes personhood a \\"special prize, not a humanly universal gift,\\" he is unable to properly enact the parable, which recognises that every person is my neighbor.<br />Andrew Sloane's article looks at one especially nasty aspect of Singer's philosophy - his support of infanticide. Sloane argues that his case for infanticide is only successful if his ethical theory (preference utilitarianism) is successful. But he argues that it is not, but is in fact incoherent and inconsistent. It is \\"an impoverished, reductionistic theory\\" which denies any \\"ultimate meaning to the universe and human life\\".<br />In such a cold world, the argument for infanticide may make sense. After all, the newborn do not contribute anything to society, and are therefore expendable. The newborn may not have any utilitarian value, according to his own theory, but he has not successfully argued that his theory should be accepted and others rejected.<br />Graham Cole argues that Singer's critiques of Christianity are misguided, as they are based on caricature and straw men. He picks and chooses those portions of the biblical account that he finds offensive, but does not appeal to other passages which may act as a corrective or balance.<br />In a chapter on personhood and Singer's view on animals, Lindsay Wilson argues that Singer, while offering some helpful contributions to the debate, in fact can not compete with the biblical picture of animals and their worth. Singer's critique of \\"speciesism\\" - the idea that humans wrongly (in his view) consider themselves better than animals - is based on the idea that sentience (the ability to feel pleasure and pain) is what unites humans and animals. Because both humans and animals suffer, Singer says we should treat both respectfully, and not give special preference to humans, based on outdated concepts of personhood and human dignity.<br />Wilson argues that Singer's views on animals have major philosophical shortcomings, and that the biblical picture, rightly understood, offers a better framework in which to respect (but not worship) the rest of the created order.<br />Preece then offers a concluding chapter on Singer's view on life and death issues, especially that of euthanasia. Singer has long argued that sanctity of life ethics should be replaced with quality of life ethics. The former, Singer rightly recognises, is bound up with the Judeo-Christian worldview, while the other is not. As an atheist, Singer prefers the latter viewpoint, arguing that the former can no longer stand up in a scientific age.<br />Two consequences flow from this. First, the biblical concept of responsibility is replaced with the secular concept of autonomy. That is, instead of seeing life as a gift, which we are entrusted with and expected to be good stewards of, life is seen as something people earn and can forfeit. Secondly, instead of seeing humans as ends in themselves, they are treated as means to an end. Instead of having inherent dignity and worth, we acquire this by our social utility and functionality.<br />Thus instead of considering all lives as worthwhile and important, Singer considers many to be worthless and expendable, based upon his own criteria of what it means to be a person. In the end his views of personhood are reductionistic and demeaning. Which is why disabled groups usually protest when he speaks, or why German audiences are less than thrilled when he shows up. They have been there and done that.<br />While all the chapters of this book are quite helpful, those by Preece and Sloane are especially strong. But every author (each one associated with Ridley College) helps to build an impressive case against Singer. This is an excellent collection of essays offering a biblical and philosophical assessment of one of our most noted and notorious thinkers.in which to respect (but not worship) the rest of the created order.<br />Preece then offers a concluding chapter on Singer's view on life and death issues, especially that of euthanasia.

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Portraits of marriage	On Valentines Day 2002 the PBS in America featured a one-hour documentary examining the status of marriage and family. This is the companion volume to that film, featuring leading marriage and family experts along with the stories, testimonials and recollections of many ordinary Americans. Taken together it provides a fascinating and incisive portrait of the related issues of marriage, divorce, parenting and family in contemporary American life.<br />The book features a number of perspectives, including those who argue for gay marriage and easy divorce. But probably a majority of contributors recognise (academically or experientially) that marriage and family are troubled institutions today, and they are in need of help and support.<br />Many of the articles are quite good, from a pro-marriage and pro-family point of view. A number of experts more or less supporting such a view are featured, including David Blankenhorn, Wade Horn, Judith Wallerstein, David Popenoe, Linda Waite and William Galston.<br />Many of their insights alone are worth the price of the book. For example, Wade Horn's article on fatherhood is  an important contribution, given all the problems we have in this area: \\"...\\"<br />And the well-documented evidence is quite clear: children are hurt by father absence. Indeed, children are hurt by divorce. And the hurt goes on for decades. Judith Wallerstein, who has studied children for three decades after their parent's divorce knows this all too well:<br />\\"...\\"<br />And marriage is what best protects children. As David Popenoe reminds us, \\"...\\"<br />David Blankenhorn reminds us that marriage is more than just a private relationship. It is also a public institution. Marriage effects not just the couple, but the in-laws, children, and society as a whole. And marriage has even more far-reaching importance:<br />\\"...\\"<br />And it is not just the conservatives who make such claims. Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman from Connecticut, for example, is also aware of these truths: \\"...\\"<br />In addition to the experts, many of the testimonies from ordinary Americans also strongly make the case for marriage and the natural family. Some of the heartbreaking tales of the impact of divorce on children for example are worth recounting. One mother offers this perspective on how her four kids responded to their parents' divorce:<br />\\"...\\"<br />Other stories could be recounted. But as this book makes clear, marriage is still very important for the overwhelming majority of Americans. And the institution of marriage is being severely tested these days. This collection of articles, stories and essays shows that marriage is more than just a piece of paper.ware of these truths: \\"...\\"<br />In addition to the experts, many of the testimonies from ordinary Americans also strongly make the case for marriage and the natural family.

Issues like human cloning, genetic engineering, assisted reproductive technologies, genetically modified foods, and embryo research are just some of the contentious areas which are making an impact on so many of us. Therefore it is important that those with religious convictions bring their concerns to bear on the new and weighty issues being debated.<br />Too often such debates have been left to the scientists, medical professionals, politicians and even the corporations to sort through. And often these folk bring to bear a secular utilitarian worldview on such issues. But these important matters should not be left for our politicians and scientists to decide upon. People with a religious worldview very much need to raise their voices as well.<br />As Nigel Cameron states in his helpful introduction:<br />\\"It is in bioethics, that point of intersection of the professions, the academy, and public policy, in which the dignity of the human being is constantly open to re-definition, and in which most of the best in our inheritance - medicine, science, the professional idea - is coming under withering fire from those whose values are radically distinct from the Judeo-Christian tradition. Our failure at the start of the new millennium to engage the culture in a degree which mirrors the size of our churches is distressing. Our failure in this realm of bioethics is particularly discouraging, since it is here that the assumptions of post-Christians are shaping their idea of what it is to be one of us. Conversely, our opportunity to make a difference at this point is immense.\\"<br />That is why this volume is so important. It offers a much-needed corrective to the various dehumanising and market-driven approaches to the many debates in the life sciences. It offers a fresh restatement of the biblical position which promotes the dignity and worth of every member of the human race.<br />In this book a number of experts look at many different bio-ethics issues, but all from the Judeo-Christian point of view. All up, twenty medical, ethical, theological and scientific experts examine the many vexing moral issues which new developments in science and technology have produced.<br />These authorities deal with such topics as: fetal tissue research, in vitro fertilization, stem cell research, health care issues, abortion, euthanasia, sex education, and many other issues. The emphasis is on applying a biblical worldview to these ethical and public policy debates.<br />The book does not just deal with specific ethics issues. It also provides chapters on Christian leadership in public policy, developing a Christian worldview, mobilising churches to engage in the issues, and dealing with the media.<br />Some of the leading thinkers and writers in the field come together in this one volume: John Kilner, C. Ben Mitchell, Nigel Cameron, Francis Beckwith and Terry Schlossberg, among others. Their meaty chapters feature incisive comment on the perplexing ethical issues of our day, along with practical advice on how we all can make a contribution to the debate.<br />Thus this volume offers a fine collection of articles which are both timely and informative. The need has never been greater for a Biblical worldview to challenge the secularists and utilitarians who have tended to dominate these debates. This volume is a welcome corrective to that imbalance.ts look at many different bio-ethics issues, but all from the Judeo-Christian point of view.

US	52661388	RKAX1FPBNVZFU	0385501684	699519594	Hail, Holy Queen	Books	3	35	54	N	N	Overstating the Case	I share a number of similarities with Scott Hahn. In may ways I have had a similar spiritual pilgrimage to him. We even attended the same American Protestant seminary - Gordon Conwell in Boston. He graduated with highest honors a few years before I graduated with highest honors. But whereas he converted from Evangelicalism to Catholicism, I have remained in the Evangelical camp. So this review reflects some major theological differences.<br /><br />At the outset it can be said that Roman Catholics will (or should) like this book. It is an impressive defense of the veneration to Mary afforded by the Catholic church. As a convert to Catholicism, Hahn is both a passionate and an articulate defender of Catholic doctrinal teaching. And as a former Evangelical apologist, he is a skilled debater and thoroughly conversant with the biblical and theological issues at stake.<br /><br />What does a Protestant make of his work? As can be imagined, differences of opinion will abound. One key issue is that of authority. Protestants tend to look to Scripture as the final word of authority. Thus the doctrine of Mary, like any other, is judged from that basis.<br /><br />Hahn argues that Mary \\"fills the pages of Scripture\\"; that \\"Marion types abound in the Old Testament\\"; and Mary can readily be found in passages such as Rev. 11 and 12.<br /><br />But except for Acts 1:14, Mary is mentioned nowhere else outside of the gospels., and no clear Marion types exist. And many Patristic interpreters regarded Rev. 12 as referring to the church, not Mary. Indeed, the idea that it refers to Mary and her assumption does not seem to be held by any of the early fathers. Likewise, the doctrine of the immaculate conception does not appear until the fifth century (and was rejected by Anselm, and Aquinas, among others).<br /><br />Hahn also attempts to prove that Mary is the \\"mother of God\\". But when the fifth-century fathers used the phrase, it was in order to uphold Christ's deity, and only later did it become a title to uphold honor to Mary. At Chalcedon for example \\"theotokos\\" (God-bearer) was used, but the supplementary phrase by Cyril, \\"mater theou\\" (Mother of God) was rejected.<br /><br />He also argues that Mary was a perpetual virgin and that Jesus had no brothers or sisters. Concerning the former, biblical support is sorely lacking. Even, the late Catholic NT scholar Raymond Brown can speak of the \\"dubious methodology of assuming without proof Lucan knowledge of Mary's lifetime virginity\\".<br /><br />He claims that the references to brothers and sisters actually refer to cousins.. But as Brown says, this is \\"a thesis that in truth faces enormous difficulties\\". And Roman Catholic scholar J.P. Meier argues that \\"from a purely philological and historical point of view, the most probable opinion is that the brothers and sisters of Jesus were his siblings\\".<br /><br />Nowhere in the NT does the word adelphos (brother) mean cousin. Indeed, the NT has another word, anepsios which is used for cousin (eg., Col. 4:10). While adelphos can mean relative, the contexts in the gospels make blood brother the logical usage.<br /><br />Hahn also makes much of passages like Luke 1:42  where Elizabeth exclaims: \\"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!\\" But in the OT there are similar descriptions. In Judges 5:24 we find the prophet Deborah praising Jael: \\"Blessed be Jael among women\\". And in the apocryphal Judith 13:18 Uzzziah says of Judith, \\"Blest of God Most High are you, daughter, above all the women of the earth\\".<br /><br />Appeal is also made to Luke 1:48  where Mary says,. \\"From now on all generations will call me blessed\\". But as Catholic scholar Joseph Fitzmyer explains, this is \\"not because of any intrinsic, personal holiness or merit, but because of him whom she is bearing\\". And again, it is not unique to Mary. A similar phrase can be found in the case of Leah: \\"How blessed I am! All women will count me blessed\\" (Gen. 30:13).<br /><br />As Brown puts it, \\"This OT background suggests that Mary's blessing is not purely a personal one. She has a role in God's plan for His people because she has conceived the Messiah who will be the glory of Israel (Luke 2:32)\\".<br /><br />Indeed, Jesus at times seems to rebuke his mother or claims made about her. For example: \\"As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, `Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.' He replied, `Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it'.\\" (Luke 11:27-28)<br /><br />Hahn maintains that the word translated \\"rather\\" can be used in different senses. Yes, but most careful NT scholars recognise that here it is being used as a correction or modification. If Jesus wanted on this occasion to elevate Mary, he could clearly have chosen less ambiguous terminology.<br /><br />And consider John 2:3-4:  \\"And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to him, `They have no wine'. Jesus said to her, `Woman, what have I to do with you?' My hour is not yet come.\\" Hahn says these words  do \\"not signify reproach or disrespect\\" However, the use of the formula is one that conveys disagreement, with the point in question being disputed. Indeed, the idiom always denotes a distance between the two parties.<br /><br />Other objections could be raised. But as I said, Catholics will find this a welcome addition to the growing arsenal of Catholic apologetics (of which Hahn has been a major contributor). Protestants will find much of interest here, and some may be persuaded. But many will remain unconvinced. But the debate is worth pursuing, and Hahn has positioned himself as a formidable defender of his new found faith. For both sides of the debate, anyone interested in the subject of Mary will find this a stimulating and challenging book.a personal one.

New developments are taking place almost weekly, and there is enormous potential for profitability. In many ways biotech has outstripped computer and other technologies as a major growth area. But while the science and technology of human life has mushroomed in the last few years, the ethics of biotech have been much less forthcoming.<br />That is, bioethics have not kept pace with biotechnology. And given how most of us are or will be affected by the new biological and reproductive technologies, it is imperative that some serious ethical thinking about biotech be promoted. But as is often the case, science is well and truly leading in this particular race.<br />Fortunately, however, there are a number of groups and individuals who are taking up the challenge by engaging in moral reflection on where the new technologies are taking us.<br />One such group that is at the cutting-edge of bioethics is the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity located just outside of Chicago. In a few short years the CBHD has become a leading center of research and study in the burgeoning field of bioethics. Its annual bioethics conference held each July draws experts from around the globe to discuss the latest trends in biotechnology, and offer incisive ethical comment on the advances being made.<br />In this, the latest volume to be released from the Center, a team of 15 experts address a wide array of issues concerning the new technologies, and the various trends in biotech. Stem cell research, cloning, the Human Genome Project, genetic manipulation, xenotransplantation, transgenics, nanotechnology and cybernetics are among the many fascinating topics covered.<br />If some of the terms just mentioned seem exotic and even unpronounceable, this is a reflection of the rapid change and development taking place with the new biotechnologies. It is a full time job just to keep up with all the new developments, let alone offer social and moral critiques of them. But this volume manages to do just that. Experts in genetics, reproductive technologies, health care and public policy not only discuss the new technologies in a clear and accessible fashion, but they also provide ethical appraisal of the developments from a Christian perspective.<br />For example, Dr Francis Collins, who contributed an article on genetic engineering, is well placed for the task. Not only is he a committed Christian, thus able to bring moral and biblical concerns to bear on the issue, but he is also the Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Washington D.C. Thus he brings top-notch scientific expertise to the debate, coloured by a carefully nuanced ethical perspective.<br />As such, he presents the many possible benefits from the HGP, but also discusses the very real dangers inherent in our new knowledge of genetics. And he is aware of the limits to science and technology. Science will not \\"shed any light on what it means to love someone, what it means to have a spiritual dimension to our experience, nor will it tell us much about the character of God. We must look to other sources to provide light for our spiritual journeys. Science is an incredibly powerful tool for understanding the natural world, but it is poorly designed for understanding these other aspects of who we are.\\"<br />A very interesting article on the future trends of biotechnology comes from Richard Swenson, the Director of the Future Health Study Center. He offers an intriguing glimpse into various future scenarios. He reminds us that above all, the economic factor will determine future trends. With health care costs consuming ever larger hunks of the national budget, expect medicine to continue to change, often for the worse.<br />And in the area of the new reproductive technologies, he reminds us that the separation of sex from reproduction is now almost complete. In fact, there are now over 25 different ways to create a baby, with no end in sight. The ramifications for the institutions of marriage and family are enormous.<br />Indeed, many of the authors in this book remind us that the staggering new advances in science and technology are radically shifting our understanding of what it is to be a human. Humanity and personhood are under serious threat, with one author going so far as to suggest that \\"mortal human beings are rapidly becoming an endangered species\\". He continues, \\"This is not a question about personal ethics, but about eugenics. The completion of the map of the human genome only brings closer the possibility of using this potentially wonderful technology as a weapon against the genetically undesirable and as a greenhouse for the genetically desirable.\\"<br />Whether the new technologies usher in a new paradise or the extinction of humankind is an open question. But clearly the new technologies are taking us in places we have never been before. And before we proceed much further, we need to do some serious thinking about the ethics of these new developments. And a very good place to begin with such reflection is this very important book.ifferent ways to create a baby, with no end in sight.

He believes that we are not really forced with choosing one or the other: either evangelize or do social reform. He says we can and should do both simultaneously. He rightly argues that meeting people's basic needs (of food, shelter, clothing, jobs, etc.) is part of what it means to be salt and light in the world. And such activities also make the gospel message much more palatable, much more believable, much more acceptable.<br />And the history of the Christian church is full of examples of the use of a whole gospel to meet the needs of whole people. Wherever missionaries went they did good deeds as they preached the good news. Hospitals were built, women and children were ministered to, hunger was dealt with, schools and job opportunities were developed, prison and work conditions were improved, and so on. It is exactly because so many Christians treated people as whole beings, not just souls to be saved, that so many people were in fact saved.<br />For example, many people became Christians in the early days of the church because of these acts of mercy and compassion. When a plague or pestilence swept through an area, most people would flee. But it was the Christians who stayed behind, ministering to the sick and needy. Many thousands of conversions took place as a result.<br />In this book Minnery, from Focus on the Family, provides examples of great saints whose lives were a testimony to many, not just because of the words they spoke but because of their actions as well. He looks at Theodore Weld, the Christian anti-slavery activist who made such an impact in nineteenth century America.<br />He also examines the remarkable life of William Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army in England. The number of souls saved and people whose lives were changed for the better as a result of his ministry numbered well into the thousands. London saw a radical transformation because of this Christian work. The help given to the city's many prostitutes, for example, is a powerful and moving story. And practical help offered to the poor and homeless by the Salvos over a century ago still provides inspiration and instruction for Christian workers today.<br />Other history makers and social transformers are discussed, such as the Wesleys and William Wilberforce. Their inspiring stories demonstrate what a handful of people can do when empowered by the spirit and motivated by Christ's compassion. Not only are souls saved but whole societies are transformed.<br />And as Minnery makes clear, the opposition such world-changers receive does not come simply from unbelievers. Often the greatest critics of these men and women of God were other believers who thought their zeal to change the world was misplaced and misdirected. Many thought they should just preach a simple gospel, and forget about slavery, prostitution and other social ills. But these saints persevered, and all the world owes them a debt of gratitude as a result.<br />This book not only provides historical examples of why Christians need to be involved in their communities, but offers solid biblical reasons for why we must be so involved. He thus answers many of the common objections, such as, \\"Christianity and politics don't mix;\\" \\"You can't legislate morality;\\" \\"Christians should avoid controversy;\\" and \\"Social engagement is worldly\\". And he provides a theological rational for why we need to be involved in our world. The command to be salt and light is just that: a command. Jesus did not say, \\"Hands up all of you who want to be salt and light\\". He said it is part of our job description.<br />Minnery deals with other objections, such as the lament that I am just one person, and what I do cannot really make a difference. He reminds us that God often works through one person, or a few people, to accomplish his purposes.<br />He also offers practical advice on how concerned Christians can impact their communities, on a local level as well as on a national level. Solid advice is given on how Christians can influence local issues and politics; how they can set up social actions committees; and how they can network with like-minded groups to make a difference in their communities. And several appendices offer down-to-earth advice on how Christians - both as individuals and groups - can get started in really making a difference in their church, their local community, and their world.<br />In an age where the world in many ways really is going down the tubes fast, there is the temptation to shrug one's shoulders and simply say, well, there is no reason to rearrange deck furniture on a sinking ship. But just maybe it is this wholesale withdrawal of so many Christians from the world around them that has lead - at least in part - to its destruction and disintegration. Instead of being salt and light, and turning our world upside down as the early church did, we have simply opted out. And the world has been the poorer because of it.<br />So this book is an urgent and necessary wake-up call for many believers. We have offered a half-baked gospel to a desperate and needy world, and we are surprised that so few heed our message. Well perhaps it is time to rethink our message and our lifestyle.

This collection of essays seeks to answer that question.<br />The social sciences have make it quite clear that marriage confers a number of benefits on those who partake of it. Married people live longer, healthier and fuller lives than those who do not marry.  How are the various professions, such as law, medicine and therapy, to respond to these facts?<br />A number of family experts, theologians, and social scientists here address these questions. The professions, they argue, have tended not to discuss such issues because marriage is often viewed as a strictly private and personal affair. But as we begin to understand the public nature of the institutions of marriage and family, the professions need to look more closely at some of the new findings concerning marriage.<br />For example, if marriage is indeed good for couples, good for children, and good for society, how should family law reconsider its role? What changes might business leaders make in the light of the new research? How should governments respond to the findings of the social sciences?<br />The 14 chapters in this book address these issues, and explore a number of related themes. The result is a new examination of marriage and its importance, especially in its social and public setting.<br />Several of the chapters alone are worth the price of the book. The chapter by David Popenoe and Barbara Dafoe Whitehead on \\"The Personal and Social Costs of Divorce\\" is a very fine summary of what the social sciences have been discovering over the past few decades. Their concluding remarks are worth repeating:<br />\\"It is clear that children are hurt by divorce, often seriously and much more than many adults seem to believe. And high rates of divorce create a social climate in which the kinds of intact families most likely to help children thrive are in ever shorter supply. Through its gradual corruption of a strong culture of marriage, childbearing, and child rearing, divorce may have negative consequences for society far greater than we now realize.\\"<br />Equally important is the article, \\"The Health Benefits of Marriage\\" by Linda Waite. She provides a helpful overview of the available evidence which tells us that married people do indeed live longer, healthier and happier lives than do non-marrieds. Singleness, cohabitation and other relationships simply do not compare with that of marriage.<br />The implications of these truths are spelled out in the remainder of the book. Legal changes, for example, seem to be in order if it is true that easy divorce has such bad ramifications for children, adults and the broader community. A return to some kind of concept of fault in divorce laws is one possibility. Covenant marriage is another. But societies must make marriage more secure while making divorce more difficult.<br />Likewise, in education we need to do more to spread the message that marriage is a valuable social good, as well as a benefit to individuals. And the negative impact of divorce also needs to be made known. Just as society has cut down smoking, drink driving and other harmful behaviours by education campaigns, such an approach is needed here as well.<br />In the same vein, counselors and therapists need to reassess their approach to marital difficulties. Instead of simply blessing a quick divorce, more work needs to be done on getting couples to work through their difficulties, and reinforcing the ideal of marriage. And marriage educators need to restore the social dimension of marriage, instead of treating it in such a highly individualised manner. Marriage is much more than a private, individual affair, and this needs to be kept at the forefront of any counselling.<br />Indeed, on every front we need to affirm the goodness and usefulness of marriage and family, while pointing out the negative results of divorce and family breakdown. Individuals and societies both need to hear this message.<br />As John Witte concludes in his article on the goods and goals of marriage: \\"Stable marriages and families are essential to the survival, flourishing, and happiness of the greater commonwealths of church, state, and civil society. And a breakdown of marriage and the family will eventually have devastating consequences on these larger social institutions.\\"<br />We now know this truth conclusively, with a wealth of social science research to back it up. The next step is to act accordingly. This book helps us to do just that.nd societies both need to hear this message.<br />As John Witte concludes in his article on the goods and goals of marriage: \\"Stable marriages and families are essential to the survival, flourishing, and happiness of the greater commonwealths of church, state, and civil society.

Many quite good books on the subject are written in highly technical jargon, making them less than useful for the common reader. Even those that seek to cater for these readers can miss the mark. The value of Moore's new book is that he is quite adept at rendering highly technical scientific information into quite plain language. Indeed, the first third of his book offers the reader a crash course on the basics of the new genetic technologies: the nature of cells, genes, DNA, etc.<br />After providing this easy-to-understand foundation, he goes on to discuss some of the difficult ethical dilemmas involved: human cloning, genetic testing, designer babies and the new reproductive technologies.<br />With a scientific background, and writing from a Christian perspective, he ably steers the reader through the ethical and theological mazes raised by the new genetic technologies. He argues that in many ways modern man is repeating the experiment at the Tower of Babel: trying to become God. Many involved in the new medical and technological breakthroughs seem to know no limits, and seem intent on developing a new man through the new technologies. But, as Moore argues, such attempts may do more harm than good.<br />While no Luddite, seeing the value of much of the new genetics, he is aware that there is a dark side to human innovation, and therefore it is necessary that we proceed with caution.<br />This is a very helpful introduction to some of the ethical, social and philosophical concerns raised by the new genetics. While the reviewer is concerned with his view that human life (personhood) does not begin at conception, the book is otherwise a very good volume to help us understand and assess the new Babel.	2002-01-03

Sure, many are getting bigger, but that is only because others are getting smaller. Church growth, in other words, is largely that of transfer growth (people leaving one church to join another), with very little due to conversion growth (people being saved and brought into a local fellowship).<br />This book examines the issue of transfer growth, and the larger phenomenon of the church growth movement. The author argues that transfer growth is wrong and it should be discontinued. In a nutshell, transfer growth gives a false view of the state of the church; it devalues evangelism; it promotes individualism instead of body life; and it detracts from the kingdom of God, exalting instead individual ministries.<br />The sad fact is, transfer growth adds nothing to the Kingdom of God: it simply reshuffles the deck. The church growth leaders of the 1980s closely examined the data and came to just that conclusion: there was no appreciable growth in the American evangelical population during this period. And the author quotes Australian research to show similar findings here as well<br />Indeed, the whole issue of church growth needs to be questioned. Too many pastors have fell to the intoxicating spell of numbers - numerical growth is seen as evidence of God's blessing. But, if this growth is simple the recycling of existing Christians, one has to question its validity. The command to reach the lost has degenerated into the desire simply to be bigger. But bigger is not necessarily better, and raiding other churches to become bigger is an unethical means of growth.<br />Of course this emphasis on numbers and the marketing techniques to obtain such numbers is a product of the secular culture around us. Says Chadwick, \\"The McChurch has replaced the traditional home church and its relational values. Fast-food Christians pull up to ecclesiastical drive-through windows, order their McGroups, consume the experience and then drive off, discarding relationships like burger wrappers on the highway of life. Savvy church growth pastors quickly learned that significant growth can occur if a church learns how to market its burgers to capture the appetite of this roving crowd.\\"<br />The truth is, church growth by conversion is a long and difficult task, while sheep stealing is quick and easy. In an age that values instant results, this is a plus. But for a church that has been told to make disciples, not steal sheep, this is a minus. Pastors must resist the temptation to take the easy path.<br />Also problematic is the fact that people often leave churches for the wrong reasons: to avoid conflict and its resolution; because of personality conflicts; impatience with worship styles; etc. Christians have become shoppers - religious consumers who instead of seeking to plug into a body of believers and stick with it, making it a better place, simply flit from one church to another, much like we flip through television channels with the remote control. Thus both leaders and lay people contribute to the sheep stealing problem.<br />There are cases, however, when a believer may need to leave a dying church. For example, churches that no longer preach the gospel message, or that teach heresy, or that are abusive, are all cases where a believe probably should leave. But such a move is about sheep rescue, not sheep stealing. It is a healthy type of transfer growth. But such a move should be considered prayerfully. Perhaps in some cases the desire to leave should be reconsidered. Perhaps staying and fighting might result in the renewal of the dying church.<br />And there is a time and place for a pastor to let go of some sheep as well. Sometimes a change is needed for the person's individual growth. But again, such moves should be prayerfully considered. Escapism is the easy way out too often.<br />Thus this book does not call for a total ban on transfer growth. But it does dismantle many of the myths about church growth, shows the dangers involved, and points to a better way. In an age of mega-churches, and Christian marketing techniques, we need to be discerning and cautious. Simply adopting the world's methods may seem to bring good results, but such results may in fact be built on sinking sand. Only churches built on the rock will stand. This incisive book helps us to do just that.le many of the myths about church growth, shows the dangers involved, and points to a better way.

The more Reformed one is theologically, the more one may experience disquiet over aspects of it. Christians from this tradition may get the impression from Wilkinson that God's hands are almost tied, that God is unable to act, or at least to bless, unless we ask, or unless we pray. God will appear to be unduly limited by the choices of his creatures.<br />On the other hand, those of a more Arminian persuasion may feel more comfortable with the book. They will recall the words of John Wesley, \\"God does nothing but in response to prayer.\\" They will agree that the Christian life is largely of our own making, of our own choices, aided of course by God's spirit.<br />And both elements can be found in Scripture. It is just that this book tends to lean in the direction of one much more than the other. Thus this book needs to be read in conjunction with other recent Christian classics - perhaps Bonhoeffer's The Cost of Discipleship, Tozer's The Pursuit of God, or Packer's Knowing God, which offer fuller, more balanced discussions of these issues.<br />One key idea of the book is the concept of a \\"Jabez appointment\\". When we ask God to enlarge our territory, to be blessed in order to be a blessing, God will open miraculous doors of opportunity. He will create divine opportunities. If we regularly pray this prayer, we will be amazed at the opened doors for witnessing opportunities and times of ministry.<br />A similar theme was made in another recent best-seller. Blackaby and King's Experiencing God (1994) also spoke of divine appointments, but offered a somewhat larger biblical context for such miracles. They noted that such opportunities were not automatic, and that barriers to such chances to minister could exist. For example, they have a whole chapter on the importance, and costs, of obedience. They recognise that God's blessings are not automatic, but are in many ways conditional.<br />Indeed, many Christians understand, as do Blackaby and King, that when we allow God to transform us and make us more like him, this will result in greater ministry for him. But Wilkinson seems to reverse the order, or at least minimise (or ignore) the preconditions. He says that we should make it our priority to seek an ever expanding ministry. This is a noble and spiritual goal which all believers should aspire to. But Wilkinson mentions very little of possible preconditions of such effective ministry. Only at the end of the book, on p. 85, does he say sin can break the flow of God's power. Otherwise he just says God wants to do great things through us, and God is just waiting for us to ask him to do that. Life-changing ministry is simply a matter of asking and receiving. But because he just does not really discuss the issue of character, there is the possibility that one can be misled into thinking that if one just prays the Jabez prayer each day, miraculous ministry will automatically ensue.<br />In sum, for many, this book will be a real faith builder, a real encouragement, a  real spiritual refresher. But there is also the danger that for some, this book will present a false picture of the Christian life. It may lead some to believe that the spiritual life is as easy as reciting a formula, repeating a prayer or claiming a promise.  But the Christian life, at bottom, is often not so simple. It usually is made up of struggle, ambiguity and difficulty. Jesus said his disciples would have to deny themselves, take up their crosses, and follow him. And to follow him means to minister like him. And he ministered as a servant, as one who gave his life for others. No triumphalism here, no easy believeism, no magic formulas.<br />This book will indeed be a blessing as long as we consistently keep the life and example of our Lord in view. His close relationship with his father resulted in ridicule, rejection, and ultimately death.

In her newest book she approaches this broad and complex subject by means of what she calls &quot;preference theory&quot;. In a nutshell, this theory holds that contemporary western women are not at all united on these issues. Instead, they have a wide variety of preferences, preferences which must be taken into account by policy-makers.<br />Hakim offers four main tenets of preference theory: First, she says there have been five historical social changes which have led to a new scenario for women and their work choices: a. The 60's contraceptive revolution which gave women control over their fertility. b. The equal opportunities revolution, giving women equal access to the labour market. c. The rise of white-collar work, which tends to be more appealing to women. d. The creation of jobs for secondary work, where career is not the number one priority. e. The rising importance of preferences, choices and lifestyle options in affluent societies.<br />Second, women have many different preferences when it comes to work. In particular, there are three idealised preferences most women have: a. Home centered preferences (about 20% of women). b. Work centered preferences (about 20%). c. Adoptive (a combination of work and home) preferences (about 60%).<br />Third, these different preferences result in conflicts between different types of women. Men, on the other hand, are much more homogenous in their preferences, and thus have an advantage over the heterogeneous women. As a result, for many women, much conflict tends to arise because of these diverse preferences.<br />Fourth, the diversity of women's preferences means that public policy needs to be more diverse, catering to the different needs and desires of women, instead of trying to aim for just one approach.<br />Using this four-fold approach to questions of female work and lifestyle choices, she offers an incisive and thought-provoking analysis which will offer much to all sides of the debate. That is, both conservatives and feminists may need to readjust their agendas, in the light of this growing body of research.<br />One of the major conclusions of this research is that women clearly do not have one view on the issue of work and home, but many. Therefore, social policy should be flexible enough to meet the various preferences women in fact have. Policies should not seek to force women into some predetermined mould. Thus, if some women want to stay at home, and eschew the paid workplace, then government policies should recognise and accept those preferences. Indeed, research seems to indicate that, for various reasons, only a minority of women will want, and will reach, the top positions of power in the workforce.<br />Contrary to much feminist rhetoric, many women prefer either part-time work or no paid work at all. Not every women is chafing at the bits to flee the home for a life as a career woman. Certainly some are however. So government policy should cater for such divergence of interests and desires. And research makes it clear that this diversity of preferences will remain strong.<br />Thus if governments want to really honour the diversity of women in their choices, they should create policies which maximise choice, and forego coercive policies designed to create a pre-determined end. In this respect Hakim suggests that governments might adopt a kind of home-makers' allowance, available to all women. This should be available to all mothers for three years or more after each birth, irrespective of their employment record.<br />The importance of Hakim's thesis cannot be underestimated. The &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach of many western governments (usually a feminist version of things) to questions of women and work tend to be restrictive and coercive. They just do not take into account the many real differences women have on the issue. Hakim's work shows us that women, like men, are notall of one piece, are not all cut from the same cloth. There is a wide-array of diversity and differences of opinion about the relationships between work, home, family, and other choices. Governments need to respect such diversity. This book is an important contribution to that end.all of one piece, are not all cut from the same cloth.

The underlining theme of this book is that the retreat away from marriage is a matter of great concern, Both from a religious and a social viewpoint, the trend to make marriage an optional extra is a dangerous and worrying development.<br />Post looks at the social evidence which supports the importance of marriage and family, especially in relation to the well-being of children. He also looks at marriage and family in history, and examines how religious attitudes towards the family have developed over the centuries. He then looks at how Christian theology pictures marriage and family. And he examines some special issues, like adoption and care-giving, the role of husband and wife, and the place of romance and child-rearing.<br />This volume is a helpful blend of the social and the theological. It shows how important marriage is both to individuals and societies, and demonstrates how the insights of faith and the social sciences complement each other.	2001-07-16

The scientific and technical breakthroughs have far out-stripped our ability to consider their ethical ramifications. The developments in the Human Genome project alone are raising many legal, ethical and social issues that need to be carefully thought through.<br />A number of books have appeared recently which examine these new developments, and their impact of society. One of the newest and most helpful discussions to date is this volume. Peterson has the advantage of not only having a PhD in ethics, but of having worked as a researcher in molecular and clinical genetics. So he knows about both worlds, and is able to deftly bring the two together in this incisive and comprehensive volume.<br />Writing from a Christian perspective, Peterson is able to discuss in detail the intricacies of genetic engineering without bogging the reader down in an overly technical fashion. He examines a number of the controversial issues: genetic testing, genetic screening, genetic surgery, genetic patents, genetic drugs, and genetic manipulation. While acknowledging the tremendous potential for good that the new genetic frontiers can offer, he is also keenly aware of the potential dangers and pitfalls.<br />Any one of these issues could warrant a whole book. Take the issue of genetic surgery. Many ethical questions are raised here. What exactly is a person? When we alter the physical attributes of a person, do we alter the person? Are we in fact creating people when we use genetic surgery? Could genetic surgery extend to behavioural issues as well? Peterson does a more than adequate job of laying out the issues and options, keeping the reader informed of the latest in scientific and ethical thinking on the debate.<br />Indeed, all the latest topics for debate are carefully examined: the Human Genome Project, the possibility of human cloning, and debates about human germline intervention versus somatic cell intervention. And all of this discussion avoids any kind of reductionism, whereby humans are reduced to their genetic make-up. The more we learn about genetics, the more we see their importance. But in spite of their importance, we also know that we are more than our genes. That is where philosophy and theology come in. Science by itself can only give us part of the picture. We need the bigger picture provided by religion and ethics.<br />Thus the value of this book.  Conversant with the latest medical and bio-medical trends and practices, he is also well-versed in the Christian literature - both Catholic and Protestant. He does an admirable job of bringing these two streams together. This is a real advantage in an age where we tend to have either technical experts with no or little moral understanding, or ethical experts with no or little scientific and biological understanding. Such important issues are ill-served when either component is neglected or omitted.<br />While both components are nicely wedded in this volume, his conclusions on some matters - such as aspects of IVF - may not necessarily please everyone. And on some issues - for example, when does human life begin? - he carefully lays out the options without fully committing himself (although his sympathies do seem to lie with respect for life from conception). But readers can learn much both of the world of genetics and the realm of religion and ethics in this lively and informed book.<br />The genetic revolution will not go away. It is important that we all become as informed as possible on the issues involved. The way ahead is uncertain. As Peterson makes clear, the new revolution in genetics can be helpful if we are very careful. But there is a dark side to this development which must be eyed carefully. His final admonitions are worth mentioning: &quot;Genetics does not so much make us automatically better as it can make us more capable. Genetic intervention, like many technologies, frees us from some constraints and increases our abilities and choices. Pursued as an end in itself it is at best a distraction, and when all-consuming, idolatry. If all we manage to do is relieve physical suffering and to control our physical world in the finest degree, our potential will be wasted.&quot;<br />In the end, the way the genetic revolution transforms life will in large measure be determined by how we, as informed citizens, keep the whole process in check. Run-away technology is always a danger. But new developments in bio-technology can be a blessing as well. Thus it is imperative that we all become as conversant with the issues as possible.

He often writes sensibly and incisively. However in this book I think he forces us into a wrong understanding of the issue of Christian social involvement.<br />While John MacArthur acknowledges that Christians should not escape cultural and political involvement altogether, his basic thesis is that our main calling is &quot;spiritual&quot; (evangelism, worship, etc.) while other tasks (social reform, political participation, etc.) are at best only of limited value and at worst are &quot;worldly&quot; and a waste of time.<br />Thus the essence of his argument is to make a dichotomy - in my view, a false dichotomy - between spiritual work like evangelism and earthly activity like cultural renewal. He just sees these as polar opposites and forces Christians to make a choice. What is it, evangelism or social reform? What is it, doing things God's way, or man's way?<br />But many, including myself, see this as a false dilemma. We believe that Christians are to do both. It is not a question of either-or but both-and. That has always been the case with the Christian church throughout history. Wherever Christian missionaries went, they both preached the gospel and did social good. Hospitals, education, prison reform, improvement of the welfare of women and children, etc. have been part and parcel of the Christian mission. Thus the Christian church has been at its best when it has been up to its ears in social reform.<br />MacArthur would have us believe that attempts to alleviate social wrongs are a diversion or worse. I am glad William Wilberforce did not heed the advice of those who said he was wasting his time, or being unspiritual, when he took on the slave trade because of his Christian conviction of the dignity of all human life. If he had listened to the nay-sayers like MacArthur we would still be fighting slavery today. I am glad Wilberforce ignored such advice and fought what looked to many to be a losing battle. Thus today we do not have to re-fight the battle over slavery (at least not in the West).<br />The point is, the Christian message is to be holistic - all areas of life are to come under God's sovereignty. That means being salt and light in a dying and decaying world. Of course we don't give up on evangelism. Of course people need inner transformation. But that does not mean we stop doing what is right, whether that means working in a secular job to feed our children, or running for political office to be salt and light. Whatever God calls us to do, we should do it.<br />MacArthur simply forces us into an either-or position that Scripture does not require of us. For a better discussion of the Christian's role in society, see the works by Charles Colson or Janet and Craig Parshall.oday we do not have to re-fight the battle over slavery (at least not in the West).<br />The point is, the Christian message is to be holistic - all areas of life are to come under God's sovereignty.

All relationships are of equal value. Marriage is an outdated and unnecessary institution. These and other objections to marriage are commonly heard today. Indeed, in a culture where history is devalued and morality is mocked, marriage, like so many other great traditions, is seen as passe. But marriage is not so easily disposed of. In fact, marriage is much more of a universal and long-standing tradition than many might expect. Marriage has been the norm of most cultures though-out most of human history.<br />It is in response to our historical and intellectual myopia that this book is written. Dane Mack and David Blankenhorn have assembled in one volume some of the most profound, most witty, and most incisive comments on marriage available. Poet and philosophers, theologians and historians, sociologists and playwrights - all are found in this anthology of writings on the beauty and wonder, the joys and frustrations, of this much maligned institution.<br />Short pithy articles come from a wide range of sources: the Koran and the Bible, Aristotle and Erasmus, Homer and Chaucer, Milton and Kafka, George Bernard Shaw and Viktor Frankl, Thomas Aquinas and Martin Luther. The breadth of diversity and the wide coverage of disciplines does not spoil the unity of this book. Marriage, warts and all, is given a new and invigorating appraisal.<br />The Book of Marriage is a welcome antidote to the scepticism and criticism marriage has taken over recent years.

Indeed, so much research on this subject exists that about six years ago I wrote an article called \\"The Case for Marriage\\" in which I summarised the available data. In this new book the massive amount of data on the benefits of marriage is collected and brought up to date. What emerges is a comprehensive and intriguing look at the importance of marriage.<br />The authors summarise the data from the social sciences in this fashion: \\"The evidence is in, at least for the ways in which marriage is practiced today: Both men and women gain a great deal from marriage. True, marriage does not affect men and women in exactly the same way. Both men and women live longer, healthier, and wealthier lives when married, but husbands typically get greater health benefits from marriage than do wives. On the other hand, while both men and women get bigger bank accounts and a higher standard of living in marriage, wives reap even greater financial benefits than do husbands. Overall, the portrait of marriage that emerges from two generations of increasingly sophisticated empirical research on actual husbands and wives is not one of gender bias, but gender balance: A good marriage enlarges and enriches the lives of both men and women.\\"<br />A few examples (of many) can be noted: Unmarried people (be they widowed, divorced or single) are far more likely to die from all causes of death, including cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and pneumonia. Married men are only half as likely as bachelors, and about one-third as likely as divorced men to take their own lives. Married people consistently report less depression, less anxiety and lower levels of other types of psychological distress than unmarrieds (of whatever variety). Married couples are far less likely to slip into poverty than are single people.<br />What about cohabitation? Isn't it the functional equivalent of marriage? The evidence clearly suggests not: \\"On average, cohabiting couples are less sexually faithful, lead less settled lives, are less likely to have children, are more likely to be violent, make less money, and are less happy - and less committed - than married couples.\\"<br />If marriage is so good for adults (let alone children), what public policy implications arise? The authors offer nine steps to rebuild a culture of marriage and to resist a culture of divorce. They include the creation of a tax and welfare policy that is pro-marriage, reform of no-fault divorce laws, restoration of the special legal status of marriage, and discouragement of unmarried pregnancy and childbearing.<br />Such proposals will not go down well with libertarians, feminists and other detractors of marriage, but they will do much to protect our children, strengthen our societies, and improve adult lifestyles.<br />For over three decades now the institution of marriage has come under sustained and severe attack. If the evidence presented in this book is at all accurate, then the guns should be redirected - it is the culture of divorce that needs to be assailed.nal equivalent of marriage?

Nor should we. Despite<br />all the rhetoric and denial by the feminists and the detractors of<br />marriage, divorce hurts children, and it hurts them even when they<br />have long ago ceased being children.<br />Judith Wallerstein, from the<br />University of California in Berkeley, first wrote of the effects on<br />children of divorce in her 1980 Surviving the Breakup. Then in 1989<br />she authored Second Chances. In that book she documented how children<br />still suffer, ten to fifteen years after parental divorce. In this<br />book she covers a full 25 years of the children's lives. Now, as<br />adults, the harmful effects of divorce are still clearly<br />discernible. Indeed, \\"the whole trajectory of an individual's life<br />is profoundly altered by the divorce experience\\".<br />Judith<br />Wallerstein began her study in 1971 with 131 children going through<br />parental divorce. She has managed to keep in contact with this group,<br />along with a control group, for a quarter of a century, thus making<br />her research conclusions difficult to dislodge. And the main<br />conclusion reached by this study is that the effects of divorce are<br />long-term.<br />Says Wallerstein, \\"From the viewpoint of the children,<br />and counter to what happens to their parents, divorce is a cumulative<br />experience. Its impact over time rises to a crescendo in adulthood. At<br />each developmental stage divorce is experienced anew in different<br />ways. In adulthood it affects personality, the ability to trust,<br />expectations about relationships, and ability to cope with<br />change.\\"<br />She continues, \\"But its in adulthood that children of<br />divorce suffer the most. The impact of divorce hits them most cruelly<br />as they go in search of love, sexual intimacy, and commitment. Their<br />lack of inner images of a man and a woman in a stable relationship and<br />their memories of their parents' failure to sustain the marriage badly<br />hobbles their search, leading them to heartbreak and even<br />despair.\\"<br />This book features seven of the original 131 children,<br />offering poignant glimpses into their troubled and traumatic lives as<br />adult children of divorce.These stories make it clear that parental<br />divorce is one of the worst things that adults can inflict upon a<br />child. While Wallerstein acknowledges that some marriages cannot be<br />salvaged, especially where much domestic violence is involved, most<br />marriages have simply been abandoned too easily and carelessly, with<br />little or no thought given for how the child will be impacted.<br />But<br />as many observers of contemporary culture have noted, the rights of<br />adults have become the greatest good, with the interests of children<br />and the social good largely ignored. As Wallerstein asks, \\"What<br />about the children? In our rush to improve the lives of adults, we<br />assumed that their lives would improve as well. We made radical social<br />changes in the family without realizing how it would change the<br />experience of growing up. We embarked on a gigantic social experiment<br />without any idea about how the next generation would be<br />affected\\".<br />Well, now we know. History and common sense should<br />have already told us, but now solid social science evidence can also<br />be presented. Divorce hurts kids, and it hurts them for a very long<br />time. The social policy implications of this lie outside of the scope<br />of this book, but clearly we need to somehow turn around the divorce<br />culture and return to a culture of marriage. Reading this book,<br />passing it on to a friend, and getting it into the hands of our<br />political leaders would be a good place to start.ak and even despair.\\"<br />This book features seven of the original 131 children, offering poignant glimpses into their troubled and traumatic lives as adult children of divorce.These stories make it clear that parental divorce is one of the worst things that adults can inflict upon a child.
