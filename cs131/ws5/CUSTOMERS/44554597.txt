This Marvel comics Book shelf reprints the first six issues the Fantastic Four in the Heros Reborn project done several years ago. I was there at the time when I bought those issues and I had some signed by Master illustrator Jim Lee!  He does the most powerful illustrations! This project was to take the Marvel Superheros like Fantastic Four, Captin America, Iron Man, and the Avengers into a Pocket Universe outside the regular Marvel Universe we know. Jim Lee was given Fantastic Four and Iron Man. This Marvel project was to re-start and re-build some of the Marvel titles that loosing readership. Heros Reborn was suppose to re-boot these characters and bring them into the 1990s era. It was also suppose to be attribute to the Stan Lee and Jack Kirby era when these Marvel comics were first published.  He wrote and drew Six issues of FF and did some plot work for Iron Man. Jim Lee was given a-lot of money do this project. He even took over Captain America and the Avengers when his Marvel Heros Reborn Collaborator, Rob Liefeld was fired for having low sales. He is a master in comic book art its field. I recommend This Marvel book shelf if you like Jim Lee! buy it! It's a great visual! Some of Jim Lee's best artwork ever!	2001-09-17
