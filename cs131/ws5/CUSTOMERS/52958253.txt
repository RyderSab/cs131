US	52958253	R3VY8ZVCFNRCJH	0399150927	6197678	Double Tap (Paul Madriani Novels)	Books	1	5	10	N	N	Interesting plot . . .overkills "that"	I read a lot and write stories for a living. It amazes me how quality writers like Martini are given free rein by editors to ruin the reader's train of thought with thousands of unnecessary \\"thats\\" inserted into what would otherwise be pretty good prose.<br /><br />Example: \\"Many of the documents THAT she prepared and the correspondence THAT she sent and received included senstive corporate information.\\"<br /><br />Neither one of the THATs are necessary to understand the author's meaning. In fact, they're like commas...a signal to pause...<br /><br />Another example: \\"It is clear THAT Rogan doesn't want to be here.\\"<br /><br />The sentence reads perfectly well without THAT.<br /><br />Martini is especially careless when he's describing a scene or his main character's thought processes.<br /><br />Example:  \\"His board of directors would have preferred THAT I ask any embarrassing questions here than in court.\\"<br /><br />or<br /><br />\\". . . appears to have been taken with a fish-eye lens up close so THAT every feature of the woman is distored.\\"<br /><br />More and more best-selling authors fall into the habit of sticking unnecessary THATs throughout their work, and their editors are letting them get away with it.<br /><br />I almost didn't finish this book because of Martini's laziness and his editor's sloppy proofing job. The plot was interesting enough, however, to keep me jumping over the THATs and keep turning the pages to find out what happened to Martini's hapless soldier, framed for a murder he did not commit, yet unwilling to give his attorneys enough information to successfully defend him.<br /><br />To the editors everywhere: If a sentence loses no meaning by the removal of THAT, please take it out!	2005-10-09

Had read IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE and EVERY SECOND COUNTS...even read RAISING LANCE, RAISING ME by Lance's mom.  Still wasn't expecting to get such a schooling as Daniel Coyle provides in his up close and personal look at the life and times of Lance Armstrong.<br /><br />Armstrong and his team granted Coyle almost unlimited access to every aspect of Lance's life -- a feat in and of itself -- during the months leading up to last year's TdF.  While Coyle sometime seems to be a little over impressed with LA's main squeeze Sheryl Crow, his focus on the energy it takes to BE Lance Armstrong pretty much stays on course.<br /><br />Like I said, I was schooled in the art of being a professional bike rider.<br /><br />(1) I knew Lance and his tightly knit team were into control, but I had no idea how seriously they need to be in control. Being a newbie to the strategies of the peleton, I was not aware how carefully they selected just who got to \\"stay in the breakaways\\" each day.<br /><br />(2) Coyle taught me about Lance's relationship and reliance upon Dr. Michele Ferrari, convicted on doping charges.<br /><br />(3) I learned about the motivation of author David Walsh (LA CONFIDENTIAL) who truly believes Lance is a doper. It's not all about the dope.<br /><br />(4) Don't think for even an instant that you can put one over on Lance...like, for example, Filippo Simeoni, a whiner who has branded Lance a doper and who tried to break away during a stage in 2004. Lance went on the attack and hunted Simeoni down...then Lance flew on up to the front eight riders on the breakaway and said, \\"If he stays, I'm staying,\\" meaning my team will be up here in just a minute and we'll ride your legs off. The eight leaders yelled at Simeoni to get the heck outta there...and he did. When Lance got back to the peleton, several members cheered him...and jeered Simeoni, whose humiliation was complete.<br /><br />and<br /><br />(5) I learned that once burnt, Lance never looks back. He seems to be completely devoid of sentimentality. Screw with him, his team, his family or his reputation, and you're not only gone, you're forgotten.<br /><br />The only surprise of the book was Coyle's near disdain for Linda Armstrong Kelly. To me, his portrait of her was one-dimensional and comes close to be cartoonish. I can't believe he spent much time with her.<br /><br />My bet is Coyle wasn't raised by a southern belle like Linda Armstrong Kelly. NOBODY gets between a southern boy and his mama.  Wonder how that chapter sat with Lance?<br /><br />Other than his handling of \\"the mom,\\" Coyle's easy-going style is light, lively and entertaining.<br /><br />If you've ever ridden a bike around in your neighborhood or even watched a stage or two of the wonder they call the Tour de France, you might do well to spend a few hours reading LANCE ARMSTRONG'S WAR. It's a whole other universe.<br /><br />Enjoy!e got back to the peleton, several members cheered him...and jeered Simeoni, whose humiliation was complete.    and     (5) I learned that once burnt, Lance never looks back.

The only regret I had during the reading of Isabel Allende's latest offering, ZORRO: A NOVEL, was the knowledge it ended at page 400.<br /><br />The kind people at HarperCollins sent an Advance Reader's Edition for my review.  How lucky for me, as Allende is an expert at her craft.<br /><br />Allende tells us the story of Zorro's early life in California, his travels to the old country, his first love and how he came to live the life behind the mask, cape and sword.  One of the sub-plots revolves around Zorro's mother and grandmother and has enough substance for its own novel.<br /><br />Allende, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, casts a spell on her readers with wonderful, long, glorious paragraphs.  They drift by as if magically suspended above the page.  This book also has a rich historical base from which Allende builds her characters and effects their lives.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with Margaret Sayers Penden's translation from Allende's native Spanish is her generous use of the word \\"that.\\"  If \\"that\\" can be removed from a sentence and the sentence's intent remain the same, it should go. Every unnecessary \\"that\\" is like a boulder in the middle of a beautiful garden path.<br /><br />It's rewarding to see such quality work on THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERS LIST.  Kudos to Allende for sharing her gifts.  Kudos to her readers for their recognition of such splendid story-telling.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-06-05

I like his Holly Barker series and I've been in lust with Stone Barrington forever. He's been one of the \\"great good guys\\" in serial fiction.<br /><br />Not this time out.<br /><br />I could not finish this mess.  This is way past \\"phoned in.\\"  It's difficult for me to believe Woods really worked on this plot.  The supporting cast are no more than cardboard cut-outs of bad guys and vixens, with nothing interesting, quirky, or redeeming about them.<br /><br />I do not know one attorney who would have taken on Billy Bob (the bad guy here) as a client, referral or no referral.  There were just too many red flags for a smart cookie like Stone to miss.<br /><br />When Woods brought Arrington (the love of Stone's life) into the sordid mess, I just closed the book and took it back to the library.<br /><br />Woods is better than this.  And a solid character like Stone Barrington deserves better, too.<br /><br />Blech.	2005-06-04

Big mistake.  Huge.<br /><br />Once the story began to unfold, I had flashbacks of long nights spent reading Robert Ludlum with my heart pounding out of my chest. I even snuck the book into my purse and read little snippets while riding in the car; waiting for my lunch; or when the others got ahead of me at the Albuquerque Aquarium.  It's just that good.<br /><br />Dan Brown weaves a great story about an ancient society's grudge against the Catholic Church; the dangers of modern science; and how one man can make a difference.  I'm so ready to go to Rome and follow in art historian-turned hero-Robert Landgon's footsteps and see the symbolism clues for myself.<br /><br />I didn't expect ANGELS AND DEMONS to be so good.

I'm new to cycling and don't know much of the inside scoop, so Barry's vignettes entertained and educated me about life on a pro team.<br /><br />Maybe an editor could have given the stories more \\"flow.\\" However, I read the book in one sitting, laughing all the way through.

Too bad.<br /><br />After THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES, I expected more than a justification for adultery published under Sue Monk Kidd's name.<br /><br />The heroine was not sympathetic.  The heroine's lover was milquetoast, at best.  The mother was brutal, to the point of self-mutilation, an act which was never explained to my satisfaction.  Even the mother's sidekick had issues.  Nothing fit for me. . .except the heroine's cuckolded husband.  He didn't deserve the betrayal.<br /><br />The actual story of the mermaid chair was more interesting that the people it effected.  When inanimate objects carry more weight than the humans surrounding it, something's way wrong.<br /><br />Blech.<br /><br />I will think twice about purchasing Sue Monk Kidd's next book.  I think I'll just use the library.	2005-05-15

Nothing was going to keep Linda Armstrong Kelly and her son from getting their piece of the American Dream.<br /><br />Knowing Lance's story is helpful, but not essential to enjoying Linda's telling of a life of poverty, less than wise choices and being mother to a live wire named Lance. (Who was supposed to be named Erica, should he have been a girl.)<br /><br />With little more than a heart full of love for her child and a huge amount of determination, Linda carved out a life for the two of them . . . truly against all odds.  Armed only with a GED and a real estate license, she rose from a temporary clerk to the rank of project manager for a major telecommunications company.  She raised Lance to believe in himself and it seems she didn't try to squelch his infatuation with danger . . . and speed.  Her determination to succeed was quickly transferred to Lance, who's natural athletic abilities were just what the doctor (and his mother) ordered/needed to keep his boundless energy channeled in a positive manner.<br /><br />My favorite part of the story revolved around Lance's early competitions, when Linda was his only \\"pit crew\\" and it was, indeed, the two of them against the world.<br /><br />While being open and honest about her own unfortunate choices, Linda shows herself to be fallible, too.  However, instead of having a pity party, she seems to learn from her every mistake and to take each personal relationship failure and make something positive out of it.  It's good to know she's found the love of her life and is happy at last.<br /><br />Never flinching from responsibility.  Instilling a good work ethic.  Teaching the value of a dollar.  Believing in the good in her child, despite some teen-age boy pranks to the contrary.<br /><br />Maybe Linda Armstrong Kelly should start her own foundation and teach parents how to raise their kids to be STRONG, responsible, caring and giving adults.<br /><br />Kudos to her . . . and that kid she raised to ride like the wind!<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-05-07

My knowledge of \\"the troubles\\" in Northern Ireland are limited. With that said, I found the story line in THE CATHEDRAL most interesting and it gave me a lot to think about.<br /><br />Cliches abound in the story, but they are not so much a distraction as just simple cliches.  The bad guys are pretty bad.  The \\"redeemed ones\\" are tempted, but do not go back to their destructive ways.  And, the good guys prevail, as you knew they would, dented and roughed up, but still the good guys.<br /><br />I listened to the book on tape on a recent road trip and enjoyed Michael Murphy's reading.  He gave each character a voice and a point of view sometimes lacking in books on tape.<br /><br />DeMille is one of my favorite authors, but this was not one of my favorite DeMille's.

In his book, MY LIFE, Clinton proves himself a spell-binding storyteller whose love of the spotlight, combined with great political instincts, propelled AND has kept him in the national spotlight for so long.<br /><br />Early on, it's obvious that Clinton is an intellectual heavyweight with enough southern charm and charisma to make the combination almost lethal to anyone who ran against him.<br /><br />It's rare that someone this bright and insightful enters politics . . .and even with his self-confessed shortcomings and many lapses in judgment regarding his personal life, I have no doubt that this country was in good hands during Clinton's two terms.<br /><br />No matter what your politics or personal feelings about one of the most polarizing figures of recent times, after listening to MY LIFE, you cannot help but admit that the man is a master of the game called politics and we'll not see his like again soon.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-05-01

Wolf's former girlfriend reappears briefly.  He begins to fall for Mrs. Billionaire.  The IRS and the FBI show up at his door and make him a counter-offer that he CANNOT refuse, if he wants to keep any kind of freedom.<br /><br />How Brooks brings all these angles into play, while keeping the reader from knowing the truth, is quite a tour de force.

While some of her later efforts have left me a bit flat, THE ICE QUEEN grabbed me and held on until the very last word on the very last page.<br /><br />An almost invisible librarian from New Jersey lives an almost invisible life, carefully removing herself from any emotional attachments after the death of her mother when she was a young girl.<br /><br />Her older brother, Ned, is her portal to the outside world.  When their grandmother dies, Ned moves her to Florida, where's he's a married professor.<br /><br />On a particulary hot day, the librarian (whose name is never given) survives a direct hit by lightning.  She reluctantly agrees to become part of a study with other lightning strike survivors.  She hears of a man named Lazarus Jones . . . nicknamed so because he was apparently dead for 40 minutes after a lightning strike, woke up, and simply walked out the hospital.<br /><br />Our ice queen is compelled to find Lazarus Jones and hear his side of the story. Jones, it seems, is still burning (literally) from the strike, while our heroine's world has gone cold and gray (literally).<br /><br />One of the wonderful things about reading anything Hoffman writes is that you must suspend your traditional beliefs and abandon universal truths to completely \\"get\\" her stories.<br /><br />I read the book in one sitting.  Mystical. Intriguing.  Thought-provoking.  Ultimately satisfying.<br /><br />Yep.  That's Hoffman at her best.<br /><br />Enjoy!!	2005-04-17

I've read most of the books in this series, and sometimes, Stone decisions are right on the ethical/moral edge; especially the ones dealing with Arrington, the love of his life.<br /><br />However, in DIRTY WORK, Stone's sense of right and wrong shows up early and stays through the last line. I loved the contrast between Felicity Carpenter's English approach and Stone's ethically correct rationale in dealing with a deadly and very smart assassin.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but the ending was rather sad to me.

He has the ability to strip a character down to its purest essence, be it good or evil or just plain stupid. I laugh a lot while reading his work, although sometimes the plot twists and turns are a little swift.

It's hard to believe there's someone out flying under my reading radar that's writing such hysterical, irreverent, yet surprisingly touching and insightful work.<br /><br />ISLAND OF THE SEQUINED LOVE NUN was my first Christopher Moore book, but it will NOT be my last.<br /><br />I have a feeling Moore musta spent some time on the payroll of Mary Kay or BeautiControl.  ;-)  Otherwise, how could he have so much insight into the way a corporation like \\"Mary Jean Cosmetics\\" works. . .or the idea of a pink corporate jet?<br /><br />Tucker Case, pilot and self-described \\"a geek in cool guy's body,\\" is in a world of trouble AND hurt when he crashes Mary Jean's jet during a \\"delicate\\" moment with a lady of ill repute.  He loses his pilot's license, but finds a job custom-made for him on a secluded island in the south Pacific.<br /><br />How Tucker gets to the island is a story in and of itself.  What he does when he gets there is the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Moore's twisted humor and irony is not for everyone.  But, if you've ever \\"puffed, puffed, passed,\\" this is your guy.  His plot line is not as simple as it might appear and things are never as they seem.<br /><br />World War II pilot Vincent, cross-dressing Kimmi, the old cannibal and a talking bat named Roberto are fresh voices and belong in a completely new genre of fiction.  In fact, I'd like to know more about Roberto . . . and I'd like to see how Vincent's card game is coming and if Kimmi is teaching \\"the guys\\" how to navigate.<br /><br />This is one of the best reads I've had in years.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2005-01-23

Like everyone else on the planet, I've been following the global warming story for years.  However, I don't think I've ever read/heard/seen as thoroughly researched argument from the other side until STATE OF FEAR.<br /><br />I'm no scientist, but Crichton's skills at blending fact with fiction sure kept me interested until the last page was turned.<br /><br />I know there is conflicting data on this issue, but I can't say I've ever been as entertained and educated while learning how to read charts, graphs and digest the information Crichton puts in front of his readers.<br /><br />I finished this book about 3:00 in the morning, got out of bed, booted up my computer and googled \\"global warming\\".  I'm going to do some research of my own.<br /><br />Crichton has hit a home run with STATE OF FEAR.  I just hope the \\"leftists\\" won't disregard it as right-wing radical propaganda.<br /><br />Keep an open mind and look up some of the author's references.

I wish Bubba had built the story around her, with Tully as an ancillary character.<br /><br />With that said, I did enjoy the sailing stories and I have an itch to make it to Belize before it becomes too commercialized.<br /><br />I look forward to more tall tales, but maybe they would be better served in short story form, not held together by anything other than the binding on the book's spine.<br /><br />I also think Cleopatra's life and adventures deserve another look.	2004-12-31

Imagine receiving a phone call from your favorite aging rock star.  Imagine that rock star asking for your help in looking after his wife, an acquaintance of yours, because he's worried about her safety.<br /><br />After picking yourself up off the floor and getting your heart rate back to normal, you set about doing this favor for your \\"secret crush\\" and find yourself smack dab in the middle of two murder mysteries, a commune of some pretty radical tree-huggers and then you have to dodge bullets meant for you!<br /><br />Well, if you can imagine all of that, you'll enjoy Virginia Swift's book, BYE, BYE LOVE.  I liked Sally, her hunky lover, Hawk, and all the characters that populate this story, set in Laramie, Wyoming.<br /><br />The only fault I found in the book was on page 232, where the author has Olivia de Havilland as the sister of Joan Crawford.

Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee are two of my favorite fictional characters. I've followed them since Chee was a pup learning the lay of the land from Leaphorn.<br /><br />This slim new story based on a long ago air disaster over the Grand Canyon contains all the elements Hillerman's readers have come to expect:  mayhem, mysteries, and, ultimately, a resolution and healing.  Reading the story about a strange old hermit that lived at the base of the canyon; diamonds long lost; a life cut short and a life lived in limbo left me wanting to know more and see more of these characters.<br /><br />Hillerman did not disappoint.

Although I've been disappointed with several of his last offerings, Stuart Woods is back in the game and has hit a home run with THE PRINCE OF BEVERLY HILLS, a lush tale about Hollywood in the late 1930's.<br /><br />Former Beverly Hills detective Rick Barron has been demoted - - due to a messy liaison with his boss' niece - - and just happens to be in the right place (Sunset Boulevard) at the right time (about 2 in the morning) when a major movie star wrecks his car and, if the press finds out about it, his brilliant career.<br /><br />Barron ends up on the movie studio payroll as the \\"clean up\\" guy and finds there is more to films that acting. He has to insure that the movie star finishes his picture. His predecessor has some pretty smarmy contacts, the remnants of which are left in the studio's safe. Even mobster Bugsy Seagal enters the scene.<br /><br />Toss in a bevy of beautiful starlets, a lot of interesting story lines and Woods has given his fans a great read.<br /><br />I look forward to more stories about Hollywood's Gilded Age and watching Woods develop Rick Barron into a movie mogul.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2004-10-15

Like some others, I'm confused by this change in Kinsey.<br />In R IS FOR RICOCHET, our normally spunky, independent, careful Kinsey is letting recently-paroled Reba Lafferty call the shots. And, Reba's a flaky a character as I can remember in recent fiction.  To have so many talents(she learned computer wizardry in prison, as well as how to cover furniture), she has no common sense at all.  Addicted to cigarettes, gambling, a horrible man, and the high she gets from walking on the razor's edge, Reba leads Kinsey on a downward spiral, despite Kinsey's good intentions.<br />There is a complicated plot about money laundering, the IRS, FBI, DEA and other federal agencies, but the main thing to remember is &quot;. . . hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&quot;<br />I like the new love interest . . . Cheney Phillips.  It's going to be interesting to see where this romance leads, but at least Cheney seems to be good for Kinsey.<br />Also, there's a revelation that caught me completely by surprise.  I'll really be embarrassed if it's been in other stories.  If it has, I do not remember it.  Page 66.	2004-07-20

I liked this novel, originally published in a black journal from 1925 through 1926.  The details of Davy Carr's middle class existence were sometimes too tedious for my liking, but for anyone who is interested in the daily lives of African Americans during the Roaring Twenties, this book is a must read.<br />I've read a lot of Edith Wharton and WHEN WASHINGTON WAS IN VOGUE fits nicely with Wharton's insider look at polite society and its pitfalls.  There was a lot of discussion in this book about &quot;passing&quot; and &quot;light skinned&quot; girls, but the story didn't shed much light on the real issues of race.  Instead the reader learned about dazzling dinner parties, week-ends in the country and late night card games.<br />There is a love story buried in the book, too.

Patricia Gaffney's THE SAVING GRACES is one of my favorite reads.  She takes ordinary lives and shines a light on them like very few writers can.  Fast paced?  Action packed?  Not one whit. But, if you'll take time to savor her stories, Gaffney can teach you a lot about human nature.<br />I liked Caddie Winger, her off-beat grandmother and all the folks at Wake House.  I even liked Christopher the Cad.  All of Gaffney's characters in THE GOODBYE SUMMER have specific shoes to fill. Without even one of them, the story would be incomplete.<br />I agree with another reader . . . I want to be THEA when I grow old.  I have a list of things to do before I die, too, although dyeing my hair red isn't on it.  *Grin*<br />Treat yourself to a slow, calm, studied look at real people facing life's challenges.

I thought this might be a male version of SEX AND THE CITY, but found it lacking in depth.<br />Oh, wait.  We're talking about young single men.  They have no depth.<br />What they do have is a lot of gratuitous sex and lascivious thoughts about sex, filthy apartments with great sound systems, nights on the town blurred from too much liquor, and they seem more concerned with a girl's body than her brain.<br />Author Kyle Smith, a critic himself, does teach his reader about the publishing world and a testosterone-led life in the city, but I was disappointed at the lack of insight into the thought process of a young male.

It's surprising that this debut collection of fictional stories by a former Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police officer has not made every best sellers list in the country.<br />Laurie Lynn Drummond is a born story teller, even if some of the tales are chock full of brutality, death and mayhem.  It's been a long time since I read fiction this good.<br />Drummond has put together a collection of &quot;police stories&quot; told from five female officer's point of view:  Katherine - Liz - Mona - Cathy and Sarah. Each woman has a distinct voice and each woman works out her issues in her own manner and timeframe.<br />Yes, there are brutal crimes, body parts, victims and police procedure, but what sets Drummond apart from other &quot;crime writers&quot; is the way she peels back the layers of her characters.  Drummond unfolds each one and presents it to her reader, like a gift.<br />One of Katherine's stories, TASTE, TOUCH, SIGH, SOUND, SMELL is almost too difficult for a civilian to read, but Drummond somehow manages to pull you through the horror.  Mona's CLEANING YOUR GUN is startling in its desperation.<br />However, it was Sarah's WHERE I COME FROM that utterly transfixed me.  Ex-cop Sarah Jeffries lands in a small town in New Mexico (population 986)and begins a new life after a series of events drove her to the brink of insanity.  Drummond's ability to link Sarah's plight, small town life, Hispanic mojo, an old man's grief and a tragic accident displays a mastery seldom seen in a first book.<br />I look forward to future work from this author.<br />Enjoy!	2004-03-20

When she finally hears his voice one night, some thirty years after his death, she cannot rest until she visits the Viet Nam Memorial Wall to touch his name.<br />Jesse's family has not fared well since his death. One of his sisters, Teresa, is in the middle of a difficult divorce. Another sister can't find Mr. Right, although not from lack of effort. His brother is an ex-con trying to connect with his estranged son.

The Vice President of Marketing for Arvin's publishing house, HarperCollins, says:  \\"Reed Arvin knocks me out with just his second book.\\"  Pretty heady statement from your boss!<br />It's rare for a new author to have such a grip on all phases of the human condition.  Arvin deals with a lot of issues in THE LAST GOODBYE.  He does such a good job at painting the underbelly of the legal system that I was surprised to find he's a musician-turned-author, not an attorney.  His grasp of medical technology and corporate ethics shows either (1) meticulous research; (2) the innate ability to look at all sides of an ethical situation; or (3) a combination of numbers 1 and 2.<br />In THE LAST GOODBYE, Arvin's main character, Jack Hammond, is a hotshot Atlanta attorney with a slight flaw in his character.  He's a sucker for a damsel in distress.  The need to rescue Violetta Ramirez, the girlfriend of a tough criminal overrides his common sense and good judgment.  The case goes south. The girl winds up brutally murdered and Jack is out on the streets before he really knows what hit him.<br />Fast-forward 2 years.  Jack's life and career are in the toilet. He's defending penny ante crooks and eking out a living only because the clerk who hands out the criminal assignments is sweet on Jack's babe of a secretary, Blu.  Hammond's still haunted by the memory of the murdered Violetta.  He lives in a drabby apartment and drives a beat up Buick.  He doesn't sleep well.<br />Jack is thrust back into life and the fast lane when Doug Townsend, an old friend and recovering addict is found dead from an overdose.  From the start, Jack smells a rat.  Doug was recovering and reclaiming his life, not relapsing back into the world of drugs.  Doug died from a needle overdose.  Doug was mortified of needles.  Mortified.<br />The more Jack digs - through Doug's things and his personal computer -the more certain he becomes that (1) Doug didn't die by his own hand (2) he was obsessed with opera singer Michele Sonnier and (3) he was involved in some pretty serious corporate espionage.  His search for the truth leads Jack into the highbrow world of opera, the Atlanta projects, and world of pharmaceutical research and development and the at-all-cost side of corporate espionage.<br />I thought this book started slow, but after Jack decides to find Doug's killer(s), the story revs up to a supersonic finale that kept me turning pages until all the plot lines were resolved.<br />If you like thrillers, this book is for you.  It's not pretty and it doesn't have cookie cutter characters, but it is an insightful look at the complexities of our legal system, ethical issues surrounding pharmaceutical research and the process of who decides what patients receive experimental treatment for the ever-growing number of drug-resistant human maladies.<br />Hollywood will love this book.

Getting his students to read is tough enough, but to comprehend what they've read is nigh to impossible.<br />Ms. Kirschenbaum has perhaps found the key which will unlock the door for my husband's students -- and indeed -- students everywhere.<br />The downside to Ms. Kirschenbaum's theories is that most textbook publishers won't (1) validate her ideas with prototypes; (2) spend the time and money to test/tweak with prototypes that are mocked up; AND (3) most teachers do not have the skills nor access to color printers and fancy computers necessary to generate &quot;interesting&quot; reading materials for their classrooms.<br />Even if they do possess crackerjack computer skills, most teachers are overwhelmed with the day-to-day realities of teaching and do not have the creative energy to devote a lot of after school time sitting in front of a computer monitor churning out beautiful text.<br />Hopefully, publishing houses will examine their options and will consider Ms. Kirchenbaum's suggestions.<br />This is a beautifully crafted book by a woman who is passionate about her vocation and the need to reach her students, by all means possible.	2004-02-15

The book is a rainbow of three-dimensional magic put on blank pages in black and white.<br />I read the book at least once a year and am amazed to find something new each time...even after all these years.<br />When you finish the book, don't be surprised to find yourself stepping out of a dream and back into the real world.  Only in the mind of the master can a wounded arm turn into a field of butterfiles.<br />If you like this book, you might want to try Marquez's new autobiography (the first of a planned triolgy), LIVING TO TELL THE TALE.<br />Enjoy!	2004-01-20

Even though Adam's pretty low on the food chain at Wyatt Telecom, he impersonates an important executive in order to throw an extravagant retirement party for a loading dock employee named Jonesie.  This was no ordinary retirement party, however.  It came complete with a fancy-schmancy caterer, ice sculptures, Dom Perignon, and a Jamaican reggae band.  When Wyatt's security cop finds the party in full swing at 1:30 in the morning, the gig is up.  And so, it seems is Adam's life as a free man.<br />Adam's broken enough laws to land him in prison for years.  The total time for embezzlement, wire fraud, mail fraud, forgery, and high tech crimes adds up to around 55 years behind bars.  Not a bright future for a 26 year old.<br />However, in a stunning confrontation with ruthless CEO, Nicholas Wyatt, Adam learns that he's not being fired, nor is he being prosecuted, and prison is not an option, either.  His relief is short-lived when he learns that, in exchange for not pressing charges, Wyatt expects him to become a corporate spy and infiltrate their rival, Trion Systems.  Trion has a new \\"silver bullet\\" they're about to unleash on the high-tech world.<br />According to Wyatt Telecom's well-placed sources, Trion has something that will knock Bill Gates off his throne.  Wyatt orders Adam to steal the new technology for them in exchange for his freedom.<br />Adam is given a crash course in how to behave like a corporate whiz kid and then he's turned loose in Trion to spy his way into project AURORA, Trion's treasure chest.<br />While Adam undergoes some intense tutoring by Wyatt brass, once Trion hires him, he's on his own and must operate mostly by instinct.  Wyatt wants AURORA and they want it yesterday.  How Adam gets it, or what happens to him in the process is of no consequence to Nicholas Wyatt and his henchmen.<br />Be warned:  Once you start PARANOIA, you'll find it hard to put down.  Joseph Finder has written a high-speed, high-stakes thriller where nothing is as it seems and the final twists aren't revealed until the last possible moment.<br />Enjoy!a high-speed, high-stakes thriller where nothing is as it seems and the final twists aren't revealed until the last possible moment.    <br />Enjoy!	2004-01-16

And PORTRAIT IN SEPIA is a good story, well told, but sometimes I felt that Allende phoned this one it instead of really working on the characters.<br />I agree that the grandmother is the focal point of the story . . . I'm not sure that's what Allende intended, but you couldn't help but love the domineering, overbearing, bejeweled woman who paid to have a huge bed carted by the house of her husband's lover!<br />I wish Allende had spent more time with a few characters, rather than filling the pages with so many comings and goings. Some of the characters really intrigued me, but they almost disappeared into the plot.<br />I'll continue to read Allende because she's very gifted.  I just hope she'll take more care of her craft in the future.<br />Enjoy!	2004-01-06

While I found the story sweet and touching, I didn't learn anything &quot;new&quot; from the read.<br />My faith teaches that we'll meet our ancestors in heaven. To me, that's a given.  The author uses &quot;real life&quot; settings in heaven to tell his story.  Frankly, I like the streets of gold theory, but what really gives me hope for an everlasting life is the prospect of being surrounded by those who have gone before.<br />I've always assumed that life's greatest questions will be answered after death.  If it only takes 5 people to do the job, that's cool.<br />If you've never contemplated the world after this one, this book might be a good first introductory read. For me, it held nothing new.	2004-01-01

The characters were well-developed and the love story between Anna and Jan held the sub-plots together.<br />The only part of the story that didn't ring true to me was Zofia's overt sexuality.  I majored in English and history, specifically focusing on social history, and this kind of behavior was rare in the bedrooms of married couples, let alone in the house of a single woman and her widowed mother.  However, the author assures me the corrupt nature of the French court spread throughout the European continent.  *Guess I misssed that class in college.*<br />Historical films are big box office right now, so I'm sure this book will be optioned by Hollywood.  Casting the principle characters should be interesting.<br />Enjoy!	2003-12-26

Maybe the print IS larger than before, but, this Father Tim/Mitford story touched me as much as any in the past.<br /><br />Maybe it's because of the holidays, but I thought Hope's storyline was terrific.  I was pulling for her and her wonderful dream.  I loved that Uncle Billy was able to give his wife something very special from &quot;Santy&quot;.  It was so true-to-character that Father Tim rescued a neglected nativity scene and put so much pride and work into its restoration.<br />I was surprised to find tears in my eyes at the end ... and now ... as I'm writing this revew.  Karon knows how to build up to a slam dunk &quot;defining moment&quot;!<br />I understand there's only one more book in the series.<br />Kudos to Karon for sharing her faith and her sweet, gentle fiction with a world that sorely needs good things.<br />Enjoy!	2003-12-11

And, so, sadly, is Brenda Joyce's vapid plot in DOUBLE TAKE.<br />I never for one minute bought Kait and Lana's story.  As wimpy as Kait was at the beginning of the story, there is no way she could have carried off such an elaborate deception.  I agree with other reviewers here who say the clues were legion, so why didn't anyone catch them?<br />  Joyce must think her readers have mush for brains . . . and she must have assumed that not one of us has ever read a mystery.<br />I still can't figure out how authors who turn out fluff like this continue to get published, while those with fresh voices and interesting plots have a pile of rejection letters in their files.<br />Blech.	2003-12-07

Having been in the vortex of some pretty vicious rumors recently, I found myself totally engrossed in this book.  I haven't read any of the Dimity series, but I enjoyed this one.<br />I have to admit the Lori-resists-a-handsome-man was a bit off-putting because there was enough tension in the main plot line to keep the action moving forward.<br />Atherton's message here was:  one bad apple CAN spoil the whole bunch -- if you're not careful.

His characters are not perfect and his courtroom scenes aren't drawn from the pages of Perry Mason. His heroes have flaws and his villains have good points.<br />In THE PROSECUTION, Portland attorney Joseph Antonelli leaves his self-imposed exile and signs on as a special prosecutor involving two Deputy District Attorneys. He leaves his home on the hill and comes back as a favor to his old friend, Judge Horace Woolner.<br />This book is really three stories wrapped, as only Buffa can do, in a nice, tidy package. Story one: the murder of a Deputy District Attorney's wife. Story two: the murder of a prominent member of Portland's old-line society. Story three: the coming back to life of Joseph Antonelli.<br />Buffa's stories aren't nice and tidy -- they're about real life. The way he constructs them, however, is as close to precision as an author can get.<br />So far, he's been able to avoid the trap of other successful authors. He's stayed sharp, crisp and real.<br />Enjoy!	2003-10-23

There are two \\"good\\" guys (well, one's a guy -- the other's a girl).  The rest of the characters are all suspect, in one way or the other.<br />Sean King is an ex-Secret Service Agent who saw the presidential candidate he was assigned to protect get gunned down.  Flash forward eight years.  Michelle Maxwell is a Secret Service Agent who loses her candidate.  He simply vanishes into thin air.<br />Other than King and Maxwell, you never know who to trust.<br />You know the two shamed agents are going to get together, but how Balducci does it is and how he weaves all the stories into an understandable tapestry is what made this book work.<br />Not to spoil the ending, I did think the storyline involving one of the final villains was over the top.<br />The author left the ending with King and Maxwell forming their own agency.  There's chemistry between them.  The sequels should be fun.<br />Enjoy!	2003-10-23

He made it through a rough childhood.  He survived testicular cancer.  He's now the father of three wonderful children.  He's won the world's most demanding sporting event five times in a row.<br />Lance now gets to savor the sweetness of his life. He's living large. He's at the top of his game professionally. The endorsements continue to roll in.  His children are thriving.  The Lance Armstrong Foundation just completed its first Tour of Hope Ride across America.<br />Armstrong's had his share of disappointments, too.  Team members have left.  Friendships have suffered.  Even though he and his wife have separated, their personal problems haven't been splashed all over the tabloids. They've handled this crisis with class.<br />I loved the humor in this book.  Who knew George Hincapie was such a funny man?  He seems so serious on that bike. Or that Floyd Landis loves ZZTop?  Or that the guys actually mooned their manager on race day?  Or that they played tricks on each other? (No chain.  No chain.) And what's up with that pink tape?<br />I watched this year's tour in utter amazement as Lance and the Big Blue USPS team met every challenge thrown at them. What a great moment it was to see that Big Blue Train win the team time trial.<br />My heart was in my throat during that horrific day of the individual time trial when Lance ran out of water and suffered so miserably, but still came in second.  What a triumph of the spirit that was!<br />I screamed when Beloki went down and Lance went across that field.  Who but a boy that grew up riding in the fields around Plano, Texas, could have made a move like that and kept himself upright through that pasture?<br />I cried when Lance and Iban Mayo went down on Luz Ardiden. I shouted when he got up. I pumped my fists in the air when he passed the pack and screamed up to the finish line. I wept when he survived the rainy road to Nance. I cheered when he rode into Paris and took his place in that elite group of 5-time winners.<br />I relived every moment when I read the last chapter of EVERY SECOND COUNTS.<br />  I'm not sure how she does it, but Sally Jenkins is able to get Armstrong's thoughts and stories  down on paper in a way few co-writers have ever done, especially in a book about sports.<br />Even if you're not a fan of cycling, this book is a good read and will inspire you to do your best at everything you try because \\"every second counts.\\"<br />Godspeed, Lance.

Scott Berg spent a lot of time on television talking about his book. He made it clear, or so it seemed to me, that KATE REMEMBERED wasn't so much like his other definitive, meticulously researched biographies had been. This book was, rather, a personal recollection of a 20 year friendship which had begun while Berg was writing the Goldwyn biography.<br />I wasn't expecting sensational revelations about her life -- although I didn't know Howard Hughes was profoundly deaf. I expected a glimpse into the later years of what was arguably one of the most interesting lives of this century.<br />Katharine Hepburn was fiercely independent, physically strong, and intensely curious -- three qualities that served her well as she embarked on a life journey that would see her become Hollywood royalty, an American icon and \\"the other woman\\" in a famous love triangle.<br />Berg's writing style is at once comfortable and compelling. I loved the anecdotes about other Hollywood notables. The one that's been played out most in the media talks about Michael Jackson trying to use Hepburn to gain an introduction to Greta Garbo. I found the story about Warren Beatty much more interesting. After a dinner at Hepburn's rented home in Hollywood -- she was there filming A LOVE AFFAIR ---<br /> Ms. Hepburn said of Annette Benning (Beatty's wife): \\"Poor girl.\\"<br />When Berg asked her why she felt that way about Mrs. Beatty, as they both seemed in love,<br />Ms. Hepburn said,<br />\\"With the same man.\\"<br />This is not a definitive biography of Katharine Hepburn. That book will surely come. KATE REMEMBERED is an intimate look at one of our greatest actresses. A. Scott Berg has honored Ms. Hepburn (and himself) by chronicling what he learned during their decades long friendship and by recording \\"Kate Remembered.\\"<br />Enjoy!	2003-08-03

Like a lot of Americans, I didn't have a clue about The Tour de France until Greg LeMond won it in 1986.<br />After that, I became a fan.<br />Before he won his first tour in 1999, I knew more about Tyler Hamilton and George Hincapie than I did Lance Armstrong. I watched in amazement as Lance rode, amid the swirl of publicity about his triumph over cancer. He became the embodiment of the underdog....cocky young man, cut down in the prime of his power...has doubts...finds love...tries to return...quits only to dig deep and find something extraordinary inside.<br />I disagree with reviewers who say Armstrong is overly arrogant and self-centered. He gives all credit for his tenacity to his nurturing mother. He says he only deserves the zipper in his yellow jersey...that his team mates own the front, back and sleeves. He even gives credit to the mountains in North Carolina for helping him finds his way back to competitive cycling.<br />In creating the Lance Armstrong Foundation, he's put his substantial profile and his checkbook where his passion lies.....in cancer research. How many other elite riders have given back like that?<br />Professional athletes can't survive without egos. It's part of what makes them so competitive. Lance has ego to let. But, remember one thing....he has four yellow jerseys and a clean bill of health to back him up!<br />As for his temper, I think he showed remarkable restraint when he crushed the competition in the first time trial of the 1999 race and then got to walk by members of the team who had dropped him when he was in the fight of his life. Oakley, Nike and Giro hung tough with Lance. Confidis caved. Personally, I wouldn't have just said \\"That was for you,\\" when he passed members of the Confidis team...the men who Armstrong felt \\"...had left me for dead in a hospital room.\\" I woulda decked 'em.<br />Sally Jenkins did a terrfic job of getting Lance's story down on paper.

I can't imagine any southern belle worth her baton and tiara reading more than 50 pages of this book.  I finished only because I was supposed to review it, but egads and little fishes, it is bad.<br />No southern belle would put up with 11 minutes, much less 11 months of not being able to (1) leave her desk (2) speak unless spoken to or (3) eat lunch ... just so she could be at the beck and call of her self-important, puffed up, manaical boss, even if HERself was the 'most important woman in fashion.'<br /> The author completely lost me when Andrea had to go get more coffee because what she had broken her neck to bring to the office was cold and when her boss screamed at her to hurry it up with her $92 lunch, only to order her to toss it because she had already eaten with someone else.  Having a pilot fly across the Atlantic just so the boss' twin daughters could each have their own Harry Potter books three days before the release date was a bit over the top.<br />The final scene (no spoiler here, because you KNOW the girl has GOT to develop a backbone at SOME point before the tale is over) is no big whoop, either.  A southern belle woulda caused such a fuss...it woulda been the talk of the town for years to come when \\"the boss\\" finally got what was coming to her.<br />I guess that's why America's fashion elite gather in the Big Apple and not Atlanta.

Precious Ramotswe is quickly becoming one of my favorite fictional characters.  For the uninitiated, Mma Ramotswe is the first female private detective in Botswana.  But, to say she's only a private detective is like saying that Father Tim (from the At Home in Mitford series) is just a village preacher.<br />I don't mind that most of the mysteries Mma Ramotswe solves are pretty transparent and not very dangerous.  What I love about these stories is the way the author weaves a spell about simple people, living gracious lives, while being kind (for the most part) to one another.<br />At the end of a Mma Ramotswe book, I'm left with a feeling of peace.<br />This is sweet, gentle fiction...set in Africa, but it's universally appealing.<br />I wonder who's going to star in the movie?

I bought this book because of a review I read in a magazine...can't remember which one.<br /> Now, I have all the books in Alexander McCall's Smith's series about Precious Ramotswe, proud owner of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana.<br />Unlike some reviews here, I can find no fault with the books.  I agree they are not complex who-done-it thrillers, but Precious Ramotswe does not lead a thrilling life.  She lives at a slower pace, more in tune with nature and her intuition than those of us in western civilization.  The mysteries she solves are not that difficult, but she takes great pride in her professionalism and treats each client with great care and compassion.<br />I particularly like the way I feel when I read about the daily happenings in Mma Ramotswe's life.  I like reading about her house on Zebra Drive; her bright secretary (who scored 97% at the Botswana Secretarial College); her companion Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni; her life growing up as the beloved daughter of a devoted father who left his life's work to her so she could open her own business; her disastrous marriage; and the variety of people who seek out her professional assistance.<br />Some reviewers have compared Mma Ramotswe to Miss Marple.  I guess the comparison fits, but it seems to me that Mma Ramotswe would prefer to belong in a category by herself....the first female private investigator in Botswana.<br />If you like the Jan Karon series about Father Tim and his beloved village of Mitford, then you might want to give The No 1. Ladies' Detective Series a try.<br />Enjoy!	2003-06-30

The material has been done in a thousand other books....famous film director marries younger star...she's killed in a dramatic fashion....he's framed/arrested/put on trial....good attorney is hired to represent him/figure out who actually did it/restore the director's reputation.<br />What surprised me about this book was the author's literary craftsmanship. He employs a simple writing style to shed a harsh light on Hollywood glitz and glamour, showing what actually happens in the world of show business.  There isn't a lot of action...and he doesn't overuse dialogue.<br />Reading this book was like being in the presence of a very good storyteller who makes you want to sit a spell and listen to what he has to say, because you know it's going to be good and it's going to be worth your precious spare time.<br />Enjoy!	2003-06-29

Fitzgerald appealed to me in high school, when I was pretty much a romantic teen-ager who fancied the tragic story of Daisy and the Great Gatsby.<br />Hemingway was my favorite author when I was in grad school.  His writing is clean, precise and open to interpretation, unlike that of other writers of his time who told you every single thing about a character's motivation.<br />While I've read a lot about Hemingway's life, I never realized the two men were so close during Hemingway's rise and Fitzgerald's fall in the literary world.  By following their relationship through their many letters, Scott Donaldson sheds light on two distinctly different literary careers.  Fitzgerald was pretty much the voice of the jazz age, while Hemingway took up the torch for the lost generation. Each had his foibles, to be sure, but it seems Hemingway was the more disciplined of the two and, as such, enjoyed a longer career.<br />I enjoyed the book and am happy to add it to my collection of Hemingway resources.<br /> Enjoy!	2003-06-12

However, when Sally Harrington is finally called to the witness stand to testify for the defense in a mob-realted murder, there is a Perry Mason Moment that would most likely never happen in real life.  Not to be a spoiler, but the moment robs this book of any credibility.<br />Then, Sally's attraction to a cop, complete with a very strange motel-room scene, left me more than puzzled.<br />I don't care for smug, one-dimensional characters who think only of themselves...and that's exactly what Sally Harrington is.<br />No more fluff fiction from this author for me.<br />It's such a pity that books like this are on the shelves when accomplished writers who weave plausible stories filled with complex characters can't find a publisher.<br />Yuk.	2003-06-12

I was prepared for the subject of self-injury that seems to be prevalent among teens today.  What I was not prepared for was the sick and twisted tale of child pornography and incest.<br />Having served on several grand juries and on our local child protective services board, I've heard more than a fair share of horrific sexual abuse stories.  I've never heard one quite like this.<br />I cannot recommend this book for light reading...and I think it should come with warnings regarding the explicit sexual content.<br />I agree with other reviewers about Lena and her long battle to recovery.  It just didn't mesh with the story line and seemed to be placed in the book as filler.<br />I won't read this author again.  Reading is pleasant escapism for me.  I see enough of this side of the world on the evening news.<br />I'm not a Pollyanna, but this subject matter is just too raw and cruel for my reading tastes.	2003-06-12

At least, the students have been exposed to the elements of a good story.<br />Every one of Coben's characters in this book are one-dimensional. The good guys are very, very good and the bad guys are truly evil. The hero is a doctor who loves practicing in the inner city, marries his high school sweetheart, and has a lesbian sister.  His wife disappears and is found dead three days later with the letter \\"K\\" branded on her face.<br />Fast forward 8 years.  The hero receives a startling email that leads him to a webcam where his back-from-the-dead wife silently mouths the words \\"I'm sorry\\" and then disappears.  Our hero will stop at nothing to find her.  I kept wishing he would so the book would end.<br />The bad guy is a billionaire with more tentacles than an army of octopi. Oh yeah, the bad guy hires hit men who break concrete blocks with their hands and kill their victim by thrusting their bare hands into their innards.  *Yawn.*<br />I'm not sure if Coben thinks his choppy non-sentences are clever or if he uses them to fill in the huge gaps between important thoughts, but they don't work; not even in a tongue-in-cheek way.<br />What bothers me more than the author's bad writing/plot/characters is that lot of talented writers can't find a publisher, while this hack continues to churn out tripe like TELL NO ONE.<br />If you like to read and have some time to kill, help me grade my freshman class' essays. They're better than this.  Trust me.	2003-05-24

Not since FINDING MOON have I been so disappointed in Tony Hillerman.<br />When I buy a Hillerman book, I don't want to read about an evil, faceless puppetmaster who pulls string in Washington and wrecks havoc in the Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn's 'four corners' of the world.<br />I want to read about problems on the reservation...or difficulties within the Navajo Tribal Police...or about how the native Americans are trying to preserve their ancient knowledge.....or about how Joe Leaphorn is finding a new life after the death of his beloved wife...or about how Jim Chee can't ever get it right with women.  I also want the book to be more than 240 pages.  This story felt like formula fiction, something Hillerman has avoided up to now.<br />The story about siphoned off oil and gas probably needs to be told, but I think a non-fiction expose would be a better venue for unveiling what could possibly be the biggest heist in history.<br />I had another issue with the story.  I never for one minute believed the author's reasoning behind Bernadette Mauelito's leaving the Navajo Tribal Police for a job with the Board Patrol.  Bernie was too close to her family/clan to move to the Mexican border.  It was completely out of character for her.  I would have understood a 'temporary assignment' with the feds, but having her choose to make that kind of radical move just never felt right.<br />For Jim Chee fans, the book does contain a pleasant surprise.  I look forward to seeing how Chee handles it in the next story.<br />This is not Hillerman's best -- but after so many good ones, he's due a hiccup.	2003-05-24

I'm glad it did.<br />Jewell tells the story of two sisters -- Bee is the one-hit wonder of the title and Ana is the ugly duckling forced to live in Bee's shadow.<br />When Bee suddenly dies, Ana's mother sends her to London to collect Bee's belongings.<br />Not content to just pack and go, Ana begins to unravel the mystery that was her sister.  She tracks down Bee's friends, lovers (past and present) and she realizes what a sad and tragic life her sister led.<br />I love Jewell's fresh take on the glitz and glamour of the 1980's rock scene.  She has great storytelling abilities.  Even though the love story was telegraphed way ahead of its final development, I enjoyed learning about Bee, Ana, Gay, Lolita, Flint, and Zander.<br />This is an author to watch.  She's got talent to let.<br />Enjoy!	2003-03-06

This book arrived at my house from the publisher...via a book review site. Somebody goofed. The only thing I have in common with this story line is that I'm the female offspring of two parents. That's where any similarity between the three Wasserman girls and my world ends.<br />Native New Yorkers will love the way the author drops restaurant names and eludes to places only natives know about. If you're Jewish and from New York, so much the better. You'll get all the inside jokes and you'll rally behind the author's secondary plot -- the state of Israel.<br />All three women in this story are high maintenance, whiny and grate on the nerves. They wouldn't last long on the farm, I can tell you that. My daddy woulda slapped Leah into next week and my mama woulda washed her mouth out with soap. Someone in my family woulda told Rachel about her philandering husband long before her nervous nellie sister Shoshanna did.<br />For all her pedigree in feminism (she was a co-founder of Ms. Magazine), letty cottin pogrebin has crafted a story about three grown women who act as though they were frozen in selfish adolescence. None of it was funny or appealing to me. But, then, pogrebin probably wouldn't find much to identify with if I wrote a book about growing up as a southern WASP, either.	2003-03-04

While I love Rita Mae Brown's ability to co-mingle the animal and human experience, I found her detailing of the incredible complexity of the fox hunting set to be more information than I need to read a mystery.<br />I love Jane \\"Sister\\" Arnold, the 71 year-old Master of the Hunt and her friends/hounds/horses, but the details in this book would appeal to only the most dedicated hunt fan. I did learn one good thing, however. Americans only hunt the fox to its den, not like their brutal British cousins who hunt to the death.<br />HOTSPUR's murder mystery takes a second -- or sometimes third -- seat to the machinations of the hunt season, the old money, the social climbers and all the ins and outs of hunt life. I suppose if you're a member of that set, these details and the constant fretting over your horse, your wardrobe and your standing in your club would make for good reading.<br />It just doesn't play in Peoria....or a small town in east Texas.<br />I'll continue to read Rita Mae Brown and hope she realizes she's exhausted the hunt and it's time to move on to other prey.	2003-03-02

Bernie knows only that Peggy was involved with a computer magnate named Wesley and that Wesley had a jet.  With the help of her long-time friend, Eric Killen, Bernie tracks Wesley to Arizona and lands a programming job at his company.<br />Bernie's appearance sets off a series of sinister events.  While she thinks she's the lead dog, watching it all unfold, Bernie is actually just a pawn in two deadly games of greed and dark sexuality.<br />Do people like Damien and Diana exist?  Are we so jaded that authors must resort to such bleak plot lines to attract readers?  I sure hope not....on both accounts.<br />I'm no Pollyanna, but the book's dark plot lines and somewhat incredible denouement stop me from giving the novel a thumbs up.  I hope Brooks will use his considerable creative talents on a more upbeat story next time around.	2003-02-25

I've been a Kinsey Millhone fan since the first page of \\"A is for Alibi.\\"  I love her, warts and all, and eagerly await each new adventure.<br />Imagine my disappointment when I finally finished Q IS FOR QUARRY.  Like some other reviewers, it took me almost a week to finish the fiction-based-on-fact story of a long ago, unsolved murder in Santa Teresa (Santa Barbara).  I felt the descriptions were way too detailed and I, too, grew weary of descriptions of the inside of bars, houses, shops and garages.  It was as if no editing took place....that every thought, word, scene was left in from the first draft.<br />What saved this story for me was to finally find out something about Kinsey's family.  Those parts, while at times tedious, were worth the effort.  I hope Grafton will pursue this sub-plot in future volumes.<br />I admire Grafton for being able to sustain a series through 16 books.  She and Kinsey can survive one stumble.	2002-11-17

Ford, who take real people and put them into ambiguous situations and let them struggle with the consequences of their decisions and behavior.<br />Frank Corso is one of those flawed characters who finds himself in the middle of a huge jigsaw puzzle involving corrupt contractors, inspectors, jurors and more than enough bad guys to fill out the mix.<br />Corso's a Seattle-based writer with some mistakes in his past, a huge financial settlement in his bank account, and a reclusive lifestyle.<br /> Corso is the only invited guest to the murder trial of Nicholas Balagula, a bad-to-the-bone mobster who is responsible for the deaths of 63 people when the hospital he built collapses.  This is Balagula's third trial and the prosecution is looking pretty secure. Corso is taking notes and gathering material for his new book when his world is rocked by the savage attack on his former girlfriend, a photojournalist who believes there's a link between the seemingly insignificant death of a school district's maintenance man and the Balagula trial.<br />After the assault, Corso's thrown into a whirlwind of plot twists, bad guys, and paper trails.  There's even some Cambodian culture thrown in for good measure (maybe the beginnings of a new book?).<br />I like Frank Corso and found myself drawn into the plot lines, even though the tidy Hollywood-like ending was a bit too predictable.<br />Enjoy!	2002-08-04

He's there to help Heather, but he's also intrigued by Poppy. He met her when he was in Lake Henry to do a story on Poppy's sister and cannot get Poppy and her independent self out of his mind.<br />Delinsky weaves the Poppy/Griffin love story with the Heather/Lisa mystery with great ease.

R.C. Pace was born in 1891 in the piney woods of east Texas.<br />He grew up on a farm, worked as a carpenter, served in WWI, and after a circuitous route that included marriage, more carpentry and some other vocations, he finally settled on a career in law enforcement.  He began as a deputy and then was elected Sheriff of Jasper County in 1937.<br />Baldwin's book is an insider's look at the life of a county sheriff during lean years and some mean years.  She relies on long-told stories to fill her book with some laughter, some tense moments and a few tears.<br />For instance, Sheriff Pace enjoyed liquid refreshment. &quot;When he had time off, he frequently drank. Sometimes he would drink for several days. Never violent, but deeply inebriated, his behavior infuriated his wife [Viva].  ...there was nothing she could do about the drinking. ... He managed to be efficient in the job and Jasper seemed content to have him in office.  The popular saying was that 'R.C. Pace was a better sheriff drunk than most men were sober.' &quot;<br />Baldwin recounts Sheriff Pace's many encounters with criminals and she chronicles his character with great care.<br />Growing up in north east Texas, I knew men like R.C. Pace.  Honest, dependable, hard working, beloved and sometimes ring-tail tooters....but, when you think about it, aren't we all entitled to a few flaws in our character?<br />Enjoy!	2002-06-16

Every now and then, life gives us gifts. They come in a variety of forms and sometimes we're not wise enough to recognize it, but on those rare lucid moments when planets align and we experience a moment of genius, we embrace these gifts.<br />Such is the instance of me finding the book THE GHOST WITH TREMBLING WINGS: Science, Wishful Thinking, and The Search for Lost Species.<br />I'm not much of a non-fiction reader and I'm certainly not a naturalist, but this book enchanted me from the  first page.<br />Author Scott Weidensaul seems to be a true Renaissance man....naturalist....world traveler....at once curious and fearless.<br />The book reads like fiction and Weidensaul could probably earn a decent living writing bestsellers if his wanderlust ever subsides.<br />From the jungles of St. Lucia to the swamps of southeast Louisiana, Weidensaul has followed the trail of supposedly vanished species, sometimes with astonishing results.  Through it all, he never loses his poetic spirit.  Here are a couple of examples of his prose:<br />...How easy, I would tell myself in daydreams, for a little thing like Semper's warbler to avoid our clumsy passage, in its rugged, wet redoubt in the  Quillesse Range of Central St. Lucia.<br />and this<br />Imagining leads to a germ of hope, and hope sometimes leads to belief, to obsession and piles of old maps, to fruitless expeditions and squandered life savings.  All of which would seem a sad and farcical pathology, except that just often enough, some luck searcher hits pay dirt, and the world stands surprised and delighted with the discovery.<br />I read this book in one sitting and recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered about the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot or the Himalayan Yeti....or the strange looking rat found in the Andes Mountains....or the deep water fish thought to be extinct years ago, only to be found at a fish market in the South Pacific.

I've been a Scottoline fan since FINAL APPEAL, and I've enjoyed watching her evolve into an accomplished writer.<br />Having said that, I must agree with 'booklover10' and say that Scottoline's latest effort has left me a bit flat.<br />The book centers on beautiful Anne Murphy, up and coming associate at the all-girl firm founded by Philadelphia legal eagle Bennie Rosato.<br />Anne, in the middle of a difficult case, decides to take an unplanned week-end off at the beach. She leaves her house in the care of an acquaintance, with deadly results.<br />Thus begins the story of mistaken identity, obsession, and a red herring plot so obvious as to be annoying.<br />I liked Anne and her dogged determination to find the killer, but the story becomes so outrageous as to ridicule common police procedures and it stretches credibility to the absolute breaking point.<br />I will continue to read Scottoline because everyone is entitled to a lapse or two, but I wish better things for Bennie Rosato and her partners. They're smarter than this!	2002-06-14

I've been a Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee fan since the beginning, but this story left me a little flat.<br />What made me such a Hillerman fan were the rich stories of a culture walking a very precarious tightrope between past and present.  This story about a swindle-gone-bad between two white men who happened to be interested in some Indian land didn't have the same feel to it as other Hillerman classics like SACRED CLOWNS or COYOTE WAITS.<br />In the past, Hillerman taught his readers important lessons about Indian culture.  This book just rehashes old territory, and it's not even a very good trip.<br />Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee and Officer Bernadette Manuelito (under utilized until now) deserve better than this.	2002-06-10

I am especially fond of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone because any woman who has the cujones to cut her hair with cuticle scissors is my kind of gal!<br /><br />After reading DELAYED DIAGNOSIS by new writer Gwen Hunter, I have found another favorite fictional female!  Rhea Lynch, M.D., works in the emergency room of a small South Carolina hospital.  She is independent, feisty, very, very tough, although she's still smarting from a relationship gone bad.<br /><br />When Rhea comes home from a much needed two-week vacation to find her best friend Marisa in the hospital fighting for her life, Rhea is devastated, but she has another shocker coming: Marisa's husband, Dr. Steven Braswell, will not let Rhea near Marisa.<br /><br />Might as well have put a red flag right in front of the bull.<br />Once Rhea starts digging into the reasons behind Marisa's sudden 'stroke,' the bodies begin piling up. Rhea is not deterred and gets to the bottom of the mystery, with some pretty surprising results.<br /><br />Gwen Hunter's new series is replete with hospital guts and gore, but her characterization of Dr. Lynch and her surroundings is so right-on that writing the stories any other way would seem the sissy's way out....and Dr. Rhea is no sissy!<br /><br />I look for more from Gwen Hunter.

I agree with another reviewer that Hunter's books contain graphic medical details, but to write Dr. Rhea's stories any other way would be to take the easy way out.<br />In this book, Dr. Rhea comes face to face with a fast-acting, virulent, and deadly virus that has her completely stumped. The first victims, an interracial couple, die within hours of being brought into Rhea's small emergency room in Dawkins County, South Carolina.<br />But, they aren't the only ones to die and before it's all over, Rhea must use every ounce of her impressive medical talent and survival skills to save her town, her staff and herself from the evil that lurks in the shadows.<br />Hunter keeps getting better.

Have all the albums/CD's, but never read the books.<br />Then, a kind friend heard I was under the weather and sent me her copy of WHERE IS JOE MERCHANT.<br />I've read a lot of what's been posted here, and I can agree with the people *including some professional reviewers*  who say Buffett's style is a little sloppy.<br />However, what he lacks in style, he certainly makes up for in substance.<br />I loved the stories about:  (1)Frank Bama -- bruised and battered pilot with a commitment phobia; (2) Trevor Kane - Frank's beautiful ex-girlfriend whose family tree is so full of nuts that her last name should be PECAN or WALNUT or ALMOND.  Trevor's looking for her lost brother, the supposedly dead rock 'n roller Joe Merchant; (3) Colonel Cairo who's looking for his lost arm, a treasure trove and control of Joe Merchant's fortunes; (4) Desdemona, macaroon-maker extraordinaire, who has been receiving instructions from 'the generators' on how to build a space ship; and (5) more subplots than a Robert Altman movie.<br />There's plenty of blood, guts and action to keep even a Steven King fan interested. One of Frank's best buddies blows up a fleet of jet skis, and while it's funny on the page, it makes the reader think about man's impact on the pristine ocean.<br />With Desdemona, Buffett even throws in some new age cosmic jokes, with hilarious results.<br />There is a twist, however, and it caught me completely by surprise.  I had to go back and re-read the passage several times before it sunk in.<br />If you're looking for the tight, compact style of Hemingway or if you're into stream of consciousness like Faulkner, this book is probably not for you.<br />  However, if you want a good story peopled with lots of interesting characters who are flawed but wonderfully written, and if you've ever wanted to just chuck it all and live in the Keys, you will probably devour WHERE IS JOE MERCHANT as quickly as I did and you'll be wanting more Frank and Trevor stories.<br />Enjoy!s I did and you'll be wanting more Frank and Trevor stories.  <br />Enjoy!	2002-05-28

In the case of THE BLOOD REMEMBERS, however, I must make an exception.<br />Terry Stanfill has written a story that rivals another great first work THE EIGHT by Katherine Neville. Stanfill has bridged the gap between past and present with a wonderful story line , very reminiscent of Neville's story of Charlemange's prized chess set.<br />Stanfill's  heroine, Rose Kirkland, has lost herself in her husband, her work and her desire to have a child. She begins to hear a voice...to experience out of body moments and she is witness to lush interior scenes of richly decorated castles. She also experiences an almost overwhelming sadness.<br />To find herself and to silence the voice, Rose feels compelled to trace her family's roots through the better portion of Europe and re-visit their long and protracted histories.<br />To say anymore would be to give away too much.<br />I enjoyed this book and look forward to more from Ms. Stanfill. Her pedigree -- she has been honored for her work in saving the 'art and architecture of Venice' -- and her storytelling talents should provide her fans with many hours of interesting reading.<br />Enjoy!	2002-05-21

After finishing David Mucci's debut novel, CARDIAC CARTEL, I couldn't help but be reminded of the plot line in John Grisham's THE FIRM.  In this case, however, it's not a young, ambitious attorney who gets in over his head....it's a young, ambitious cardiac surgeon who gets thrown to the sharks.<br /> Dr. Peter Pavano doesn't even get a chance to catch his breath and enjoy the perks of being a 'fellow' in a prestigious angioplasty program before his life unravels before his eyes.<br />He's set up for a fall, but Pavano is man with more lives than an alley cat. He's smart and he remains alive by staying one step ahead of the really, really bad guys.<br />I don't read many self-published books because I find the quality lacking.  This is an exception and I recommend it to anyone who likes a thriller.  You don't necessarily have to like medical thrillers to enjoy this roller coaster ride.<br />Strap yourself in and set aside several hours because once you start CARDIAC CARTEL, you won't be able to put it down.<br />I look forward to other work from Mucci.  He's got a voice and a real talent for weaving a tale.  And, his bad guys are truly evil.  If there's a movie version of this book, I'm sure Hollywood will cast someone like Matt Damon or Leonardo DiCaprio as Dr. Pavano, but there is no one that can play bad guy Dr. Barbosa better than Frank Langella.  The part is tailor-made for his particular kind of evil eye madness.<br />Enjoy!	2002-05-21

In the beginning, hardly anybody even noticed.\\"<br />Taffy Cannon's new series starring tough-gal Detective Joanna Davis, is a great tour-de-force of police work, even if the victims are less than sympathetic.<br />Cannon has an ear for dialogue and she's a cracker jack storyteller.  I read the book in one sitting and was never quite sure of how it was going end. Cannon doesn't telegraph action, she allows it to unfold as it might in real life.<br />The villain in OPEN SEASON ON LAWYERS is a doozie..crafty, clever and well-financed...and determined to rid the world of ambulance chasing slime balls who prey upon the legal system.<br />I'll be reading whatever Cannon writes. And, I'm a fan of her heroine Joanna Davis..she's tough and she's had her share of hard knocks, but she's a survivor with enough determination to 'stay on the trail' until the killer is found!<br />Enjoy!	2002-03-30

I was a loyal Ludlum fan and mourned his declining craft long before I mourned his death. I liked Follett in the beginning, but he, too has pandered to the masses, leaving his skills on the word processor.<br />THE ENGLISH ASSASSIN is Daniel Silva's fourth book and a page-turner from start to finish. While his body count rivals that of early Ludlum, Silva is a more polished story teller.<br />THE ENGLISH ASSASSIN begins with the death of Augustus Rolfe, an elderly Swiss banker who collaborated with the Nazis (no new territory here) to acquire numerous pieces of art during World War II.  At the end of his life, Herr Rolfe decides to atone for his sins and return the paintings to the heirs of their original owners, thus exposing the dirty little secret all Swiss fear.  Publicity of this kind just won't do, so Herr Rolfe is killed.<br />Gabriel Allon, Jewish intelligence agent/art restorer who is set to receive the paintings, finds Herr Rolfe's body and thus the chase begins for the real killer  and the enormous power behind the Swiss conspiracy of silence.<br />While I'm a little tired of the Nazi 'rape of the art world' story, I'm glad to have found someone who writes solid spy stories.  I look forward to more work from Silva. As they say in show business, he's got the 'legs' to last a long time.<br />Enjoy!	2002-03-19

If this is a true depiction of the world our children are living, then maybe it's time for that huge meteorite to just break through the atmosphere and blow us all into oblivion.<br />I've never read anything so twisted, sick, and absolutely without hope, happiness or even the possibility of any of the characters ever leading a happy life.<br />I'm not a Pollyanna-wannabe, either.  I lived through the sixties and some pretty rough patches myself and I work at a social welfare office, so I've seen plenty of bad situations, but this story is the bleakest of the bleak.<br />Never mind the poor editing which other reviewers have pointed out....what should catch your attention is that this writer, because of his mother's popularity, has a built-in audience.  And if that audience feels like he does (as obviously they do, considering the number of positive reviews), our society is in deep trouble.<br />No wonder Columbine happened...no wonder people are killing themselves, their spouses, their children.....no wonder we're immune to the news that a woman has drowned her children in a bathtub.<br />I will continue to have hope and happiness in my life, but I'm old and if what's coming up behind me are people like this author and his characters, what will the future hold?  Like the characters/plot/title of THE SNOW GARDEN...it will be colorless and completely devoid of life.	2002-03-16

Although bullied by his father into rough and tumble games and some rather cruel scenarios, Joshua Royalton grew up in a caring environment where he was allowed to live in his own interior dream world.  Growing up in the Royalton household wasn't easy, nor was it uncomplicated, but his parents must have done something right, for when Josh chooses to 'come out' to them during his sophomore year of college, they accept his homosexuality with grace and understanding.<br />What struck me about this book was that, unlike his gay fiction-writing contemporaries, this author's ultimate message was one of hope and acceptance of one's family, one's choices and ultimately, one's self.<br />After reading THE SNOW GARDEN and some other recent gay fiction, I found the landscape to be bleak and so terribly devoid of hope.<br />THE BIG BOOK OF MISUNDERSTANDING seems to work through all the messy trial and tribulations of growing up gay and its hero comes out on the other side with hope and a peace rarely seen in other stories.<br />Kudos to Jim Gladstone for giving other gay teens a ray of hope.  While it must be incredibly difficult to grow up knowing you're outside society's boundaries of 'normalcy,' Gladstone shows his readers that there is life after out there ....and it's up to you to become part of it.....gay or not!<br />Enjoy!	2002-03-16

They lack the discipline a good editorial staff brings to a piece of work.<br />With that said, I'll recommend MENGELE'S LEGACY because the author (1) knows his biology and (2) we're not the same world we were before 9/11 and the anthrax scares.<br />I don't know much science, but I'll try to explain the author's main plot line....Joseph Mengele, Hitler's henchman, was able to alter the make-up of human cells so that they cause mysterious deaths. Dr. Mengele infected Jews and Africans with these cells during the holocaust and after several generations, the mutated cells became HIV/AIDS.<br />What Doctor Isaiah \\"Izzy\\" Slesinger, the hero of MENGELE'S LEGACY and America's preeminent protein biochemist, needs to do is to find Dr. Mengele's copious notes and dissect the 'Mengele cell' and stop the ruination of the human species.<br />The science part of this book is well done..almost too much technical information for a novice like me, but I did come away with a better understanding of how difficult it will be to find a cure for HIV/AIDS because of how it mutates differently in each individual.<br />There is a lot of Ken Follet/Robert Ludlum cloak and dagger action in the book, but some of it is so implausible as to make the reader groan. I know there are new neo-Nazi movements in the world, and I know we need to be vigilant, but some of the characters and plots proposed by the author seemed to be more science fiction than thriller material.<br />The author has promise, but he needs a quality editorial staff to guide him through the maze of plot lines and to re-organize his chapters so there is continuity and not confusion.  With Ludlum gone and Follett/Woods faltering, the world needs good thriller writers!	2002-02-18

The entire time I was reading THE ENGLISHMAN'S DAUGHTER, I felt as though I was reading a well-researched piece of historical fiction. Ben Macintyre has done a terrific job with a story that was begging to be told to the outside world.<br />In 1914, seven British soldiers, separated from their units for one reason or the other, found themselves trapped behind enemy lines. The citizens of Villeret, a small village near the front lines, hid the soldiers, fed them and kept them safe...sometimes to their great peril. However, after one solider, Robert Digby, fathered a child by one of the village maidens, someone blew the whistle on their charade and four of the soldiers, including Digby, were shot by the Germans.<br />I was never as concerned as the author about who ratted on the soldiers...they were in the middle of a war....everyone was under a great deal of stress...food was scarce....the German threat of retaliation was real....any number of people could have spilled the beans. The fact that the village kept them for over 2 years is a miracle of human constraint and discretion.<br />Macintyre was a reluctant author, having been sent to a small village of Picardy to record the dedication of a plaque on the spot where the soldiers were killed. After the ceremony, an elderly woman told him that one of the murdered soldiers was her father. Intrigued, Macintyre pursued the story and THE ENGLISHMAN'S DAUGHTER is the splendid result of his effort.<br />I'm not a true fan of non-fiction, but this book is so well done and the story is so compelling that I read it in one sitting....all the while trying to cast the characters in the film. Harrison Ford (in his younger years) would have been perfect as Digby. Angelica Huston would make an excellent Jeanne Magniez, the aristocrat who loved her horses more than people. Olympia Dukasis would be the perfect one to play Claire Dessenne's mother. Claire herself would be tricky, because her photos are at once beautiful and have an air of intelligence about them.<br />I hope someone with Hollywood connections finds this book.

Poppy Rice, head of the newly re-vamped and highly efficient FBI Crime Lab and a woman with extraordinary influence over the FBI director himself, has a dilemma.<br />In just 10 days, alleged ax murderess Rona Leigh Glueck, is about to be the first woman put to death in Texas since the Civil War.  Trouble is, Poppy doesn't think the tiny, malnourished, sick and zonked out 17 year-old could have wielded the ax that chopped up Melody Scott and James Munter into enough pieces to leave the blood dripping from the ceiling at the crime<br />scene.<br />Now 34, Rona Leigh has found Jesus and believes her punishment will finally set her free from her lurid past  and the horrible events 17 years before. She confessed to the crime and is now at peace with her lord.<br />So, why upset the apple cart and go sticking your nose in a 17 year-old case that was solved almost as soon as it happened?  Because Poppy Rice believes in giving everyone a fair shot and the FBI crime lab, under different directorship, had failed to answer a request from Rona Leigh's public defender who had the same questions about her ability to swing an ax with enough power to kill two people.<br />Because Poppy Rice cleaned up the prior mess of a lab and \\"...turned a sinking trawler -- infested with a lot of rats --. . . into one sleek nuclear-powered yacht,\\" she has a lot of leeway with her Director and he reluctantly agrees to let her work as a \\"...full-time pseudo-district attorney\\" and reinvestigate cases she thinks might contain errors.<br />Poppy sets about to find out what really happened on the night Melody Scott and James Munter died.  Rona Leigh was at the scene, no doubt about it, but could her boyfriend Lloyd Bailey have done the actual killing?  No way to talk to Bailey because he died in prison.  So, Poppy heads to Texas to talk face to face with Rona Leigh, but finds herself on a roller coaster ride.<br />She talks to the condemned woman, her former chaplain/now husband, the warden, some Texas Rangers and Melody Scott's slimeball husband, Gary. Poppy's substantial influence fails to deter the Governor on his mission to see that justice is served and that Rona Leigh dies by lethal injection at the duly appointed time.<br />Poppy is even allowed to watch the execution....only trouble with the procedure is that it fails to kill Rona Leigh, and through a series of carefully planned events, the prisoner escapes to parts unknown.  Poppy's mission, now, is to find Rona Leigh and bring her to justice.<br />This is the first in a series of Poppy Rice novels.  Poppy is smart, sexy, sassy, independent, tenacious as a pit bull and has all the power of the Federal Bureau of Investigation behind her.<br />The writing is crisp and the plot is well-developed.  I love the author's use of dialogue.  The book is not without its faults, however.  There are some glaring errors in the book that any good editor/research assistant should have caught:<br />1.  non-air-conditioned jury rooms haven't existed in Houston since the 1950's;<br />2.  nor do our courthouses have filthy bathroom facilities for juries (inmate labor handles those chores);<br />3.  at one point, Poppy opens a window and says that she needs real air, even if it is \\"dry and hot\\" ..... dry and hot are never spoken in the same sentence in Houston due to the constant humidity, which Poppy does refer to later on ....;<br />4.  you can't make the trip from Houston to Huntsville in a half hour unless you're in a plane....even if you're coming from the very north of Houston, you have to navigate through The Woodlands and Conroe and all the never-ending construction;<br />5.  the author must have never driven from Houston to Huntsville, because she says the buildings of Huntvsille \\"creeped over the horizon,\\" when the only buildings you'd see from the interstate are fast food places, service stations, a Wal-Mart, some restaurants and a few hotels.

The entire nation turned its eyes to Jasper, Texas, during the summer of 1998. James Byrd, Jr.'s horrific death at the hands of three white supremacist shocked us all. How could this happen in 1998, we asked ourselves? How could we live in a society where one is beaten, has his face spray painted black, and his dragged to his death behind the back of a pickup truck just because of the color of his skin?<br />Reporter Dina Temple-Raston has just written what I believe will become the definitive book on Byrd's murder and its aftermath. I'm not sure how an attractive woman reporter from the northeast, with no obvious ties to east Texas was able to capture the essence of our lives, but she did. And she did it brilliantly...with a few exceptions.<br />I have some problems with her geography and basic facts that a good editor should have caught: Houston is NOT the capitol of Texas (p. 39); Sulphur Springs is NOT in central Texas (p. 71)...it's in north east Texas between Dallas and Texarkana; it's located in HOPKINS county, not Delta County (p. 137); and Vidor is SOUTHWEST of Jasper, not northwest (p. 142). These errors will cost the author some credibility, but they don't take away from the essence of the story: Despite the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, we have not put our racist past behind us.<br />We are lucky that Temple-Raston chose to pay more attention to her subject matter and to handle the characters swirling around in the plot with much more care than she paid to her geography. She details the lives of the three killers: Bill King; Russell Brewer; and Shawn Berry with great care. She is honest in her depiction of James Byrd, Jr. as an alcoholic who couldn't keep a job, drove his wife and children away, and even borrowed money from the preacher's elderly mother.<br />Temple-Raston saves her best writing, however, for Sheriff Billy Rowles. By all accounts, Rowles is the main reason Byrd's death did not rip the town of Jasper clean in two. Rowles pulled Jasper's leaders together and kept order as best he could. With much insight and greater human instinct than most law enforcement officers possess, Rowles used Great New Bethel Baptist Church preacher Kenneth Lyons, Deep East Texas Council of Governments Director Walter Diggles, Jasper Police Chief Harlon Alexander and Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray to keep the peace.<br />I read this book in one sitting. Being from east Texas and living through the segregated 50's and 60's, I am saddened that we're still fighting these racial battles today. I am heartened, however, because in the 50's and 60's, this story would have never been told outside Jasper county and the killers would have not faced the death penalty. At least, now the stories are being told and light is being shed on one of America's most difficult issues.<br />This book will be a best seller in Texas, guaranteed. It should be required reading for anyone involved in law enforcement and it should be mandatory for anyone who denies the problem of racism in our country.<br />Kudos to Temple-Raston. This is one of the year's best reads.owles pulled Jasper's leaders together and kept order as best he could.

There can be no more tragic story than a man who leads a double life, swindles his family members out of their life savings, kills his elderly parents, his wife and two children, attempts to kill his mistress, and then, finally, tries to kill himself.<br />French author Emmanuel Carrere's telling of the twisted life of Jean-Claude Romand could have been this decade's IN COLD BLOOD. Instead, it's more expose than excellence. I read the book in one sitting, not so much because I was compelled but because I wanted to find out why Romand turned out the way he did. There are a few clues: he was overweight (the author uses the word 'flabby' a lot to describe the murderer); he sweated profusely; he wasn't very successful with women, though he married a lovely woman and had an affair with another; he was bright enough to get into medical school, but he missed an exam...rather than facing the consequences and repeating the course, he chose to begin a life of total deception; he lied about his work at the World Health Organization (WHO); he took his parents' and his mother-in-law's life savings and spent it on expensive trips and gifts for his mistress.<br />The author never explains why Romand turned out the way he did other than to discuss how lonely his real life must have been while he was traveling back and forth to his 'office' at the WHO. He also never really gives any explanation why Romand's friends and family never suspected anything was askew...even though his wife never had a phone number to reach him....even though they never socialized with any of Romand's colleagues.<br />What kept running through my mind was HOW WAS HE ABLE TO SUSTAIN A COMFORTABLE, MIDDLE-CLASS LIFESTYLE WITHOUT ANY VISIBLE SOURCE OF INCOME?<br />This story would have been a classic in the hands of Truman Capote or Vincent Bugliosi, but it falls so short under the direction of Carrere. Whatever the reason, a potential classic is mangled into a so-so real-life murder mystery.<br />What a pity.pity.	2002-01-01

Rather than facing life and its consequences, he chooses to run away and live on the street, surviving by selling dead pigeons to restaurants who then serve it to their patrons as &quot;squab.&quot;<br />Colin &quot;Birdy&quot; Franklin is doing all right on the street, but then he hooks up with some shady underworld characters and ends up working at a food processing plant that turns out surprising fare, including ground up rats.<br />Birdy emerges as a leader of the workers in the plant, and by examining their lives, he begins to put the pieces of his shattered life back together.<br />While reading this bleak novel, I was reminding of Sinclair Lewis' expose on the meat-packing plants and I decided NEVER to order squab again!<br />There are underlying subplots in the story, but the main focus is on Birdy and his re-awakening to the realities of life....we're all human and we make mistakes.  We all need to forgive and be forgiven.<br />I gave the novel 3 stars because it is so very bleak and stark.  I read for recreation and entertainment...and being middle-aged, I've kinda figured out  some of the lessons in the story, so I would advise anyone looking for a quick, easy week-end read to find another story. It's not that Stone can't write...it's just that his subject matter is so dark and troubling.	2001-12-30

One Amazon reviewer says, &quot;Another great American novel,GONE WITH THE WIND,  depicted the people and times...Carolyn Howard-Johnson's great American novel, THIS IS THE PLACE depicts the people and the times....&quot;<br />The only thing similar between GONE WITH THE WIND and THIS IS THE PLACE is that they were first novels.  That's where any comparison should end.<br />The jacket for the book says:  &quot;A fond and bitter story, THIS IS THE PLACE is set firmly in the midst of the Mormon culture of the 1950's. It is about how intolerance affects souls and society, about subtle prejudice as well a blatant bigotry....It is about how prejudice can be disguised with love, family, and religion and how it can turn on those who use it.&quot;<br />Maybe you need to be from Utah or be 1/2 Mormon and 1/2 Protestant, as the book's heroine Skylar Eccles is.  Maybe you need to have grown up not knowing about racial prejudice in the south or ethnic prejudice in the northeast.<br />To me, the story never shows the reader any real bigotry, nor were there any real consequences for those who weren't Mormon. Other than not having her grandparents at her wedding (they couldn't come because it wasn't in one of their wards), Sky doesn't seem to suffer much from being a half-breed.  She goes through normal teen-age crises, but nothing like being denied access to an all-white bathroom, drinking fountain, or restaurant.<br />Another reviewer says:  &quot;The written word has never before congealed into such a beautiful tale....&quot;  I believe readers of Virginia Woolf or Issak Dinesen or William Faulkner or Ernest Hemingway would disagree.<br />What the book seems to be, rather than such a grand epic, is a possible fictionalization of the author's own therapeutic journals. Her stories are singularly personal and really don't reach across the page with any interest for her readers.  The author had issues with her Mormonism, to be sure, but to make them into a self-published book seems to be a bit of a stretch.<br />If you grew up in Utah and you have issues with the Mormon's dominance of all aspects of your life, maybe this book is for you.  However, readers from the other 49 states probably won't find enough substance to hold their interest.ed book seems to be a bit of a stretch.  <br />If you grew up in Utah and you have issues with the Mormon's dominance of all aspects of your life, maybe this book is for you.

It's not new territory, nor is it scientifically sound, but it's a quick read and a pretty handy guidebook for those just entering the dating/mating game.<br />Like other reviewers, I found the part on gods/goddesses more interesting than the rest of the book, as I'm a middle-aged, monogamous woman married for many, many years....based on Kehoe's assertions, I'm a cross between a Persephone, Athena and Artemis and I'm married to a cross between a healthy Dionysus (not so ego-centric) and a Hephaestus.  Since we've been very happily married for a number of years, I'm assuming our combination is okay.<br />HEARTS AND MINDS is neither exceptionally scholarly nor is it new information.  It is, however, cleverly packaged and easy to read.  I suspect those who find it useful will be young and 'on the hunt' for a partner/mate.<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-27

Her beloved husband, Lee, the local veterinarian, is bereft at the prospect of losing his wife and turns to another woman.  Kathleen has to hold it together for the sake of her young daughter, Marie, who is coming of age just as her mother is dying.<br />Marie, in turn, knows about her father's dalliances and her mother's impending death, even though her parents deny it.  She falls desperately in love with Ben Ashbrook, the handsome but disturbed heir to a huge ranch.  When Marie becomes pregnant, she and Ben marry, to the dismay of everyone, including Alice Ashbrook, Ben's over-protective mother.<br />Fast forward to the story of Nora and Leslie,  Marie's children.  Marie has just died in a horrific car accident that took the lives of 2 other people.  It's up to Nora to find out (1) why Dr. Carlile and his wife were traveling with Marie on the late night of the accident and (2) why there were large amounts of sedatives in her mother's body.<br />The format of FAMILY CORRESPONDENCE is sometimes difficult to follow, but you should stay with this book until the end....when there is a moment when everything falls into place, the pieces fits and the questions of the past are finally put to rest.<br />This is Teresa Miller's second novel.  Her first was REMNANTS OF GLORY.  She is an author to watch.  She is a wordsmith in the style of Sandra Scofield....her characters have very rich interiors and they deal with life-altering issues that don't always end up in pretty packages tied neatly with ribbons.  In other words, she deals with real people facing real issues and the consequences of their choices.<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-16

I'm not sure what gifts God gave Jonathan Kozol, but one of them is true compassion and insight without judgment or pretense.<br />I was continually amazed, as was Kozol, at these children's tenderness, kindness, their incredible gift of insight and their wide-eyed innocence.<br />At the back of the book, there is an address for St. Ann's Church. I will be sending them a check...for St. Ann's Scholars...for Pineapple and Elio and Mother Martha and all the children and caretakers who perform miracles day in and day out.<br />This should be required reading for not only present/future teachers, it should be required reading for the human race.<br />I hope Kozol and his kids win the Pulitzer/Nobel/and any other available award!<br />Read this book...you will be richer for it.	2001-12-12

An old college buddy tries to gun him down in broad daylight....his brother may or may not be dead....and no one or nothing is what it seems.  In other words, this book is VINTAGE LUDLUM!<br />I agree ... the present tense on the jacket .... he is dead.  If there are indeed 11 outlines on the boards, I certainly hope they'll do us fans a favor and reveal WHO ghosted the work(s).<br />Although he steadfastly maintained he never had any 'spy' experience, he must have been either (1) hooked up with someone who LIVED the world of espionage or (2) he did more than 'voice overs' to put his kids through college. He simply knows too much.<br />I didn't like a lot of Ludlum's later works -- they were just too contrived and sometimes way beyond the realm of possibilities -- but with THE SIGMA PROTOCOL, the master returned home for one last triumph!<br />Enjoy!	2001-12-07

This is not an easy book to read if you come from a family who (1) keeps secrets (2) has interesting members or (3) lived through some turbulent times.  Time and time again I found myself listening the Marlette's characters say the EXACT SAME things my grandmother/mother/cousins said to me and to each other.  Situations in the book strangely resemble situations in  my family....and reading about them in a published novel made me a bit uneasy.<br />I loved the way Marlette intertwined the present with the past. In the present, Marlette tells the story of Pick Cantrell, who moves home from New York City and struggles to put his life back together.  Waiting to collide with Pick's story is that of his prickly grandmother &quot;Mama Lucy.&quot;  Seems she has quite a story of her own to tell.  Until the ghosts of Pick's present and Mama Lucy's past are put to rest, nothing will be settled in either of their lives.  Watching the two storylines converge was a pleasure.<br />This book is a strong testimony for anyone who has struggled with their family tree, burned/destroyed bridges and would like to re-build them.<br />This may be Marlette's first turn at fiction, but, to me, THE BRIDGE is in the same league with the likes of THE PRINCE OF TIDES.<br />Enjoy!	2001-11-23

Being somewhat of a believer in these things, Terzani took the seer at his word and spent 1993 traveling by land, train, cab, bus, steamer, elephant, or cruise ship.<br />As I read this wonderfully lush travel guide, I was struck by what we 'frequent flyers' miss.  We miss the rhythm of the country, the smells, common people, and the flip side of local life the airports don't feature.<br />While some of Terzani's experiences were a bit graphic for my tastes, and I probably could have done without yet another political commentary on how the West has corrupted the East, I thoroughly enjoyed his many visits with local fortune tellers.  I especially liked the vestal virgin.  I laughed out loud at Terzani's recanting of that meeting.  Some of the fortune tellers he found during his travels were accurate, or close to it.  Some were charlatans.  They were all, however, interesting.<br />What a rich life Terzani has lived.  All the best to him and I look forward to more stories from his pen.<br />Enjoy!	2001-11-15

At the same time, rather than merely following money or fame alone, or choosing the path of least resistance when in conflict, they are thoughtful about their responsibilities and the implications of their work.&quot;<br /> The authors spend a lot of time discussing Journalism and Genetics and how ethics and good work in these two arenas are under seige from a market-driven economy.  They offer up solutions on how to restore good work to the world and they share their methods of studying good work and their interviewing protocols, but the subject matter is just too academic for the average worker who struggles with ethics v. economics.<br />Maybe the book will reach university professors...and they'll share it with their students...and they'll go out into the world and strive to do 'good work.'<br />Let's hope so.	2001-11-11

The author must have spent a good deal of time interviewing his subjects, because the book offers up some great stories/quotes, too.<br />The book is broken down into interesting chapters such as:  THE COWBOY LIFESTYLE - RANCHING COUNTRY - GETTING IT DONE -- FAMILY LIFE - RANCH HORSES (my particular favorite) - DEFINING THE COWBOY - RANCHING TRADITIONS.<br />Some of my favorite quotes:  On Ranch Horses:  &quot;If a horse ain't plum lame when you get done nailing the shoes on, you've done all right.&quot;<br />&quot;There is something about a horse.  They are a lot prettier animal than a man is, but not quite as pretty as a woman. They are beautiful animals. I was raising horses when I was raising my children.  I raised them together.  I credit that relationship with the fact that not one of my children has ever been involved in with drugs.&quot; (Rex Allen)<br />Or, the one in Family Life:  &quot;I'm Dusty, my wife is Sandy, my boy is Rocky, and my dauther's name is Wendy.  Our names describe this ranch perfectly.&quot; (Dusty Ray)<br />I'm keeping this book on my coffee table for easy access. When I'm feeling penned up, I'll open it up, look at the wonderful photos, read the quotes and dream of life under the big sky of Montana or the scrub bushes of New Mexico.<br />Enjoy!	2001-11-11

I agree with the other reviewers here who had a problem when, about 1/2 way through the book, the author shifted the focus from veteran sleuth Matthew Scudder to the sick serial killer who drives the plot.<br />This is my first Block book, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but rather than make it 1/2 Scudder and 1/2 killer, I would think the story could have been the first in a series of books on the evil psychiatrist who kills without remorse and stays one step ahead of his detractors. Maybe the editors thought a series on a villain wouldn't sell as well as a new Scudder book...who knows?<br />Anyway, the villain is really despicable and evil to the bone. Block develops him well and compels you to read about him, even though he wrecks havoc on those he chooses to destroy.  The ending certainly invites a sequel.  I'll probably read it...not because I'm such a Matt Scudder fan, but to see where the evil doctor winds up this time.<br />Enjoy!	2001-11-11

It's fun to watch Holmes teach AND learn from Ms. Russell and it's great to observe Ms. Russell's growth during story.<br />The mysteries are almost secondary to the story of Holmes and his young, headstrong pupil.<br />I'll be reading more of this series.

Diana's tragedy pulled me into the story and did not let me go until I had turned the last page.<br />I've never suffered such a loss, but I feel the author really portrayed Diana's journey through the darkest hours of her grief and recovery with amazing insight.<br />I loved the New Jersey characters and learned more than I could ever imagine knowing about cranberries and their environment.<br />This is a character-driven book that offers rich rewards to its readers.<br />I hope the author will write more.<br />Enjoy!	2001-10-22

I got this book for my husband, as he's the non-fiction reader in our family.  I was out of something to read, so I picked it up and could NOT put it down.<br />Bridges does a great job of putting a lot of convoluted information into readable form.  Edwin Edwards and his Crazy Cajun Cronies didn't really do anything new...they just continued a long tradition of crooked Louisiana Politics!<br />I enjoyed almost all of this book...the only parts that made my eyes glaze over were the details regarding the financing.  My mind just can't wrap around deals where the broker stands to make 27 MILLION dollars....and then one million a year after that!<br />If you ever wanted a peek into the world of slick politicians, oily gangsters and brash billionaires, this is your book.

And, I must add, he did it with little bias...the only time his feelings are known is when Ken Starr and his 'elves' use their positions as bully pulpits.<br />After reading A VAST CONSPIRACY, I believe I understand how deeply the Republicans hated Bill Clinton and to what lenghts they would go to oust him from office.<br />I hope it was worth it to them.	2001-09-18

I've just read some of the negative reviews of this book and felt compelled to re-post my initial review....where's the harm in wanting to do good? I can't imagine a &quot;Mother Russia&quot; scenario, as one reviewer suggests.<br />Oh, well, that's why there's chocolate and vanilla.<br />For my money, the 'movement' these authors highlight will most likely run afoul...there is hope for our planet.<br /> Psychologists Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson have written a handbook for people who are working to make this world a better place. Their book, THE CULTURAL CREATIVES - HOW 50 MILLION PEOPLE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD - is a guidebook for those who are interested in saving the planet, nurturing their personal relationships, and being sensitive without being stomped on. You might be a Cultural Creative if you're into: books and music; arts and culture; stories; social causes, especially issues dealing with women and children; and authenticity. The authors have created an interesting test to gauge where you stand in the mix and use a lot of graphs throughout the book to identify cultural creatives and their issues. If you're from the '60s and you've ever wondered what to do with all the energy created during that period of our lives, this book will open your eyes. If you've sometimes felt like an alien in your own family, the authors will offer you comfort because you're not alone. Even if you're just wondering why cultural creatives are so passionate about their lives, this planet, and their causes, this book will help you put it all together. Cultural Creatives include such personalities as: Pope John Paul XXIII; Martin Luther King, Jr.; The Dalai Lama; Annie Dillard; Georgia O'Keeffe; Marc Chagall; Yo-Yo Ma; Robert Redford; Katharine Hepburn; and Bill Moyers. Pretty good company, don't you think? While the book represents a lot of research on the part of the authors, the data is never presented in a dry, boring format. I found it hard to put the book down. The information resonated with me -- I'm from the 60's -- and it gave me hope for the future of our species and our planet.

I became a Greg Iles fan after reading THE QUIET GAME and was really looking forward to his latest offering.<br />I read DEAD SLEEP in one sitting, but not because I was riveted to the chair....I kept reading because I wanted to find something to like.<br />The story centers around Jordan Glass, an award-winning photojournalist who's burned out, used up and looking for some meaning to her life.  She has never recovered from the loss of her father (also a photojournalist killed during the Viet Nam Conflict) and she's only recently had to deal with the disappearance of her twin sister Jane.<br />After one of her friends insists on her seeing an exhibit of Chinese watercolors said to capture the pure essence of nature, Jordan hops on a plane to Hong Kong.  At the exhibit, not only does she see the watercolors, she stumbles upon the work of an anonymous artist who paits women in various stages of sleep (or is it death)....and finds herself staring into the eyes of her missing sister.<br />From there, to plot thickens, but never gels....at least not to me. I'm not sure what Iles was trying to accomplish (other than to create a villan in the image of the wicked Hannibal), but it didn't work for me.<br />I wish Iles would stick to what he does so well...writing about the South and its rich characters.  Flitting from Hong Kong, to DC, to New York and thereabouts didn't make for interesting reading.<br />Iles is better than this.	2001-08-12

I read Anthony Bourdain's hilarious article in THE NEW YORKER magazine last year and couldn't wait to read more about his years spent in the bowels of some of New York's finest restaurants.<br />KITCHEN CONFIDENTIAL did not disappoint. I laughed all the way through the book and learned a lot along the way. Think Hunter Thompson, drugs and all, writing about the restaurant business.<br />I learned that running a restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Just hauling all the bloody meat carcasses around would be enough to turn your stomach. Learning to carve the beef, fish, poultry and lamb would put me off the job right away. The pressure of turning out 600+ dinners in an evening is daunting.<br />Paying the bills, keeping the nut-case employees happy, knowing which Italian family currently controls disposal of waste, and trying to stay on top of the ever changing and always fickle American palette is enough to make anyone's head spin.<br />The leveling factor, or so it seems, is chemicals -- and lots of them. I don't think Bourdain has drawn a completely sober breath since he first stepped into a commercial kitchen at the Dreadnaught in Provincetown, Cape Cod. When they weren't drinking up profits from the Dreadnaught's bar, they were high on coke, LSD, mushrooms laced with honey, and finally, heroin.<br />As Bourdain explains:<br />So who the hell, exactly, ARE these guys, the boys and girls in the trenches? You might get the impression from the specifics of MY less than stellar career that all line cooks are wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts and psychopaths. You wouldn't be too far off base.<br />After reading this riotous tale, I've made some changes in my dining out behaviors. I will not eat fish on Mondays. I won't &quot;do brunch.&quot; I will schedule my dining excursions for weekdays, not weekends.

Even though he's a popular author with a huge following and plenty of security, former Houston prosecutor Penn Cage is a haunted man. He's just lost his wife after a lengthy battle with cancer; he's being stalked by the brother of a man he successfully prosecuted and sent to death; and his young daughter sees her dead mother everywhere. After a particularly heart-wrenching experience at Disney World, he scoops his daughter into his arms and heads for the only place where he can find peace: HOME.<br />Home is Natchez, Mississippi.<br />Home is where his father, sixty-six year old Dr. Tom Cage, is still practicing down home medicine, complete with house calls and no HMO's. &quot;My parents started life with nothing, and in a single generation, though hard work and sacrifice, lived what was once unapologetically called the American Dream.&quot;<br />Home is where his mother longs to help her son and her granddaughter heal. Peggy Cage is &quot;...a girl who made the social journey from the 4-H Club to the Garden Club without forgetting her roots. She could take tea with royalty and commit no faux pas, yet just as easily twist the head off a banty hen, boil the bristles off a hog, or kill an angry copperhead.&quot;<br />Home is where the Cage's beloved family maid, Ruby Flowers, waits: &quot;Ruby Flowers came to work for us in 1963 and, except for one life-threatening illness, never missed a single workday until arthritis forced her to slow down thirty years later.&quot;<br />Home is where Cage and Annie can find peace and recover from their loss.<br />Or is it?<br />&quot;Natchez is unlike any place in America, existing almost outside time.....In some ways it isn't part of Mississippi at all....Natchez exists in a ripple of time that somehow eludes the homogenizing influence of the present.&quot;<br />Upon his arrival at the Cage home, Penn immediately suspects that something is seriously wrong. His father has been cashing in large CD's and cannot account for the money's whereabouts. When Penn finally figures out the reason, his determination to clear his father's name leads him into a hornet's nest of deceit, greed, and a 30-year old murder case.<br />Before the 559-page book ends, no one escapes unscathed. Penn's parents must relive a particularly difficult time in their lives. Penn's values and judgment are challenged to the extreme. He also has to deal with Olivia Marston, his long lost love and the unanswered questions surrounding his feelings for her. And, at the core of this story lies the underbelly of Natchez' racial history which is exposed in the most unflattering way possible.<br />The local police and the FBI enter the fray, making for a hair-raising, spine-tingling, thought-provoking read that doesn't let up from the first page until the last.<br />This was my first Greg Iles book, but I can promise you, it won't be my last. Iles has a gift for suspense, introspection and characterization like no other writer around today. He's been compared to John Grisham, but I think he's in a league of his own.<br />He's a young man and THE QUIET GAME is only his 4th novel.

I cannot understand why he wouldn't quit at the top of his game.  Surely all the bestsellers he had afforded him a comfortable life.  I would have much rather wished for more than to have read the drivel that came in the later years.<br />If you're looking for good espionage and cracker jack writing, read any of the BOURNE series.  For a bit of fun, read THE ROAD TO GONDOLFO.  Don't read anything in the last 10 years.  And, don't read this new one.	2001-05-21

Maybe the readers who don't like this book were in a hurry...this book requires, almost demands, to be read slowly, deliberately, and not in one sitting.<br />I've not found a book in recent time that held my attention and drew me into the story more than this one. I read it after hearing a piece on NPR...and I've passed my copy on to friends who have also enjoyed the wonderfully crafted prose.<br />Although there are three separate stories going at one time, I never felt disjointed or disrupted during the shifts.<br />I've even re-read the book three times and will read it again...it's that good.<br />If you can get beyond some of the negative reviews, and if you can give yourself time to absorb the Cunningham's glorious prose, you just might find a gem of a story just waiting to be unearthed.<br />Enjoy!	2001-05-21

No, this book is not pulp fiction, nor will it ever show up on anyone's summer reading list, but it is, given time and patience, one of the all time best examples of the written word at it's very zenith.<br />I read the book in college and then re-read it right after finding Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS and seeing Vanessa Redgrave in the movie.  Clarissa Dalloway is one of the most carefully developed characters in fiction.  Additionally, Woolf's detailed and exquisite interiors are worth savoring -- almost word by word.<br />Woolf was one of the great voices of the English language.  Her work compels the reader to slow down and feel the words.<br />Enjoy!	2001-05-21

She had difficulty with the material and the author's style and wanted to know what I thought.<br />This book is a mess.  The language tries to soar, but fails due to the weight of the words. The story tries to be something it's not, too. I consider myself open-minded and willing to consider most any idea that would explain the madness of the world, but I couldn't follow the plot of this work.<br />I noticed the book was published by Writers Club Press.

We all had to learn not to be too attached to the farm animals.  Every small town in America has an 'evil' woman who stews puppies for dinner.  We all had that one horrible teacher who bedeviled us in elementary school.  And, we all had siblings who drove us nuts.<br />What sets this book apart is the sharp, crisp writing of its talented author.  I laughed out loud when she described how her sister had told her she was adopted.  I laughed even harder when her mother confirmed the sister's allegations with an even more elaborate tale of gypsies and a green velvet bag for trade!<br />This is not Proust, but it is a glimpse into a life/time that we probably will never see again....innocence and a sense of community.<br />Enjoy!	2001-05-07

I'm really sleepy at work today, but I'm happy to report that this 3rd novel by John Case (synonym for a husband/wife writing team) has lost none of the snap, crackle and pop of the first two (THE GENESIS CODE and THE FOURTH HORSEMAN).<br />I liked the characters in this book and thought the psychological aspect of the story was well-presented.

I have enjoyed all Stone's many escapades with Arrington and the gang, but I really think it might be time to let Stone take a much needed and uneventful vacation.<br />Woods needs to invent a new character -- maybe revise that wonderful woman from ORCHID BEACH -- with new adventures.<br />I found several editing errors in this new release and I thought the short chapters were proof positive that Woods has retreated to the comfort zone of writing just a bit a day and not staying with the storyline long enough to see it develop other than in fits and starts.<br />Woods has talent with great stories to tell.....he shouldn't be wasting them on jaded themes.

Hughart does what all authors wish they could do....they make their readers want more.

I didn't much care for any of these people -- they were just too self-absorbed for me. I did like Cathy Scarlet's parents, but found the Tom's young niece and nephew irritating and not one bit cute. Honest and forthright, but irritating nonetheless.<br />I also found the constant changing of plot line distracting rather than engaging and I was surprised that Binchy kept the descriptions of the Scarlet Feather's food to such a bare minimum.  Some Irish recipes would have been nice.<br />Binchy's one of my favorite writers and she is capable of so much better than this...and I hope the rumors of her retirement are false and that this isn't the way she chooses to 'go out.'	2001-03-12

I wound up reading until 4:00 a.m. and was back up at 8:00 to finish this marvelous book.<br />The story centers around Allison and Cherie, the unfortunate offspring of a marriage between Ruth and Warren, two very unhappy people.

If you still believe in fairy tales, you'll enjoy this 90's version of Cinderella.<br /><br />Cornelia Lord, rich beyond belief, is trapped in a life of New York parties and debuts that don't suit her and leave her empty. The persona she shows to an eager publicity-hungry public is quite different than the one she uses in her work at the Nikola Tesla Museum she's helping to organize.  After the loss of  Cornelia's mother, she and her father, the venerable Chester Lord, become strangers living under the same plush roof.<br /><br />To fill the void left by his wife, Chester worries about making more money and saving his company from a hostile takeover. To ease her pain, Cornelia pulls stunts like splashing around in the fountain at the Plaza and has gained the nickname &quot;Corny the Crazy Deb.&quot; Her life is rich fodder for the tabloids.<br /><br />Our modern-day Cinderella story is gender-blind.  Instead of a wicked queen, this fairy tale's villian comes in the form of Tucker Fisk, a partner in Chester's firm and a suitor for Cornelia's hand (and money). While seemingly attentive and mindful of the high-strung Cornelia's needs, he is actually more interested in her trust fund and the 25% voting shares of Lord &amp; Company.<br /><br />Enter the Handsome Prince in the form Kevin Doyle, newly hired doorman for Cornelia's apartment building.<br /><br />Kevin and Cornelia's story is a great romp and a fresh twist on an age-old story.<br /><br />I also went out onto the net and found information on Nikola Telsa.  What an interesting man....no wonder the author used him as the focus of Cornelia's interest and energy!<br />  Enjoy!	2001-02-17

I first became aware of Don Foster when I read JON BENET:  INSIDE THE RAMSEY MURDER INVESTIGATION, the book written by one of the lead detectives on the infamous child beauty pageant queen.  The Boulder Police Department used Foster's expertise to unravel the mysteries of the ransom note left of the back stairs of the Ramsey home.<br /><br />I vaguely knew that Foster had been the expert who first 'outed' Joe Klein, the anonymous author of PRIMARY COLORS.<br /><br />What I didn't know was that Foster had been one of the people who worked on the Unabomber case, leading law enforcement right to Ted Kaczynski's door, nor did I know he worked on  &quot;The Talking Points&quot; memo during the Clinton/Lewinsky affair.  I also didn't know his claim to fame was proving that an obscure poem was actually penned by one William Shakespeare.<br /><br />Even if you're not particularly fond of non-fiction, this book is pretty interesting and will keep you turning page after page.  I would like to know exactly what kind of 'searching' he does through the documents he reviews, but I suppose that would be giving away too many trade secrets.<br /><br />I'll say this....If I'm ever involved in any kind of espionage or intrigue, Don Foster would be the first person I'd call to help me figure it all out.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2001-02-04

Florence &quot;Pancho&quot; Leontine Lowe Barnes may have been to the manor born and bred, but she chafed at her parent's prim and proper society and decided to be true to the one person she could count on -- herself.<br /><br />Until I read this book, I only knew of Pancho Barnes and her Happy Bottom Riding Club from the movie THE RIGHT STUFF.  She was the proprietor of the saloon/motel/dude ranch where all the test pilots from nearby Edwards Air Force Base hung out.  Her character didn't get much footage in the movie, but she was compelling enough to warrant further investigation.<br /><br />Author Lauren Kessler offers an insider's view into the life of this enigmatic woman, from her privileged childhood to her poverty-stricken death.  This is no mere biography...it's a tour de force of the woman behind all the legends.<br /><br />Pancho Barnes was raised by wealthy parents.  Her grandfather had made his fortune with patents and in real estate in the early part of the 20th century.  Her grandfather died broke, but he lived large.  Her grandfather and father doted on her and indulged her every wish.  She was puzzled by her mother's world of socials, needlework and fancy dresses.  She was dazzled by horses, the outdoors and demanding physical activity.<br /><br />Early on, it was clear that Florence was not going to be a beauty, nor was she the shy and retiring kind. She rode horses, played outside and generally behaved as a young boy. School bored her.  Afternoon teas and the<br />idea of running a house set her teeth on edge.  Even though she obeyed her family's wishes and married an Episcopalian minister and had one child, she was never a conventional wife or mother, in any form, shape or fashion.<br /><br />As a diversion from her unhappy marriage, she found work as a horse wrangler in the fledgling movie industry.  She worked as a stunt person in some of the films she provided horses for.  She discovered flying and it became her life-long passion.  She found love in the arms of many men, including her four subsequent husbands.  She cussed like a sailor, drank whiskey with the best of them, and rubbed elbows with Hollywood elite.  She could hold an audience captive with her storytelling acumen.  She ran a dairy farm, a pig breeding business, a boisterous resort and maintained a stable full of fabulous horses.  She spent three fortunes and died broke, but she lived life to the fullest and made the most of every moment.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting and dare anyone who starts it to try and put it down.<br /><br />Pancho Barnes was one of a kind.

Celine Arneux, famed photographer -- her daughter Sumin -- and granddaughter Cameron are connected by blood only.<br />Forget the warm and cozy relationships of Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club. These three women of Chinese heritage are more akin to Madame Mao.<br />Celine is now retired and living in her beloved Paris. Sumin and her lover Grady live in the states, as do Cameron and her ward, the 6-year old Alice. The four females agree to meet at a cabin in Virginia where Celine took provocative photos of Cameron when she was a child.<br />Not one relationship in this family is healthy or based on any kind of true respect for its circle. Celine is aloof and cruel to her daughter. Sumin resents the one-time relationship her mother had with Cameron and has never really found her way in the world. Cameron boils over with anger at grandmother for taking such intimate photos of her and at her mother for allowing the photos to be taken. There are so many unresolved issues in this book that one needs a scorecard to keep up with them all.<br />Add to this caldron of raw anger and emotional immaturity the fate of the young Alice, whose mother has been forced to return to China without her. Each of the three women -- Celine, Sumin and Cameron -- wants to raise Alice and the battle over her future becomes bloody and extremely brutal.<br />An Empire of Women at once riveted and repulsed me. Although the author does an excellent job of telling the story, the subject matter and its devastation were a bit too much for my taste. The only character who truly evoked sympathy was Celine's Chinese mother -- and my heart broke for her on almost every page.<br />I look forward to other work from this author. She's got a voice and a gift -- my wish is that she finds something lighter to write about next time around. This story just wore me out.	2001-01-26

The murder of six year old JonBenet Ramsey will probably never be officially solved and no one will ever stand trial for the brutal death of the child with the angelic face.<br />The world watched in horror as the family suffered through intense media scrutiny and publicity. Our hearts were wrenched as we watched Patsy cling to her pastor and her friends after the child's memorial service. We sympathized with the family when they moved from Boulder to Atlanta to free themselves from constant reminders of their tragedy.<br />What we didn't know, or at least I didn't know, was that from the very day the child's body was discovered in a hidden room in the family's basement, the Ramsey's were being coached, guided, and directed by a dream team of lawyers, publicists and media-savvy handlers who probably did more to obscure justice than OJ Simpson ever thought of. In the least, they built a wall of protection around themselves so strong that no small police department like Boulder's could have ever challenged it.<br />If only 1/2 of the details that former Boulder Police officer Steve Thomas sets forth in his book are true, then I must re-examine my sympathy for the child's parents, Tom and Patsy Ramsey and look at the facts.<br />The family has always maintained that 'an intruder' killed the child. However, in painstaking detail, Thomas destroys that theory with the following questions.<br />Would an intruder:<br />have taken the time to close JonBenet's bedroom door, which Patsy said had been found closed;<br />have taken the time to relatch the obscure cellar door peg that police and Fleet White (friend of the family) found in the locked position;<br />have placed JonBenet beneath a blanket and taken care to place her favorite pink nightgown with her;<br />have tied the wrists so loosely that a live child would have hardly been restrained;<br />have wiped and/or re-dressed JonBenet after the assault and murder;<br />have fed her pineapple;<br />have known the dog was not home that night;<br />have been able to navigate through a dark, confusing, and occupied house without a sound in the quiet of Christmas night;<br />have been so careless as to forget some of the materials requires to commit the kidnapping but remembered to wear gloves to foil fingerprint impressions on the ransom note...<br />and many more....<br />Thomas resigned in protest over the police department's mishandling of the case and the incompetent District Attorney's unwillingness to prosecute someone as prominent as the Ramseys. Even if you don't believe everything you read in this book, it's worth the time it takes to sift through the intricate details and maze of frustration the police officers faced from the first frantic 911 call from Patsy until the day the Grand Jury adjourned without comment.<br />I had an opinion of what happened to the child before I read this book. I've changed my mind. I agree with Steve Thomas' theory and I'm sorry he's left law enforcement. He was one of the good guys.og was not home that night;<br />have been able to navigate through a dark, confusing, and occupied house without a sound in the quiet of Christmas night;<br />have been so careless as to forget some of the materials requires to commit the kidnapping but remembered to wear gloves to foil fingerprint impressions on the ransom note...<br />and many more....<br />Thomas resigned in protest over the police department's mishandling of the case and the incompetent District Attorney's unwillingness to prosecute someone as prominent as the Ramseys.

A series of close encounters with those interested in his actions show him to be resourceful and even quite dangerous.<br /><br />I couldn't help but think back to THE BOURNE IDENTITY as I read this book. Follett has lifted a lot from Ludlum's masterpiece in this boilerplate tale, but he kept me interested enough to finish the book in two sittings.<br /><br />The first decade of space program and our race to beat Russia is the backdrop for the book's plot and flashbacks to the glory days of life before World War II are used to set up the characters' histories.<br /><br />It's not too hard to figure out who's who, but Follett keeps the plot moving quickly enough to avoid boredom.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2001-01-07

If you've been waiting for a new voice to fill the void left by Ludlum's laziness, Follett's failures, and DeMille's dame-chasing detective, look no further than Steve Samuel.<br />In this debut, Samuel has crafted a story with every essential element necessary for a heart-pounding thriller!<br />He's got a cracker-jack Secret Service agent with a tragic past -- he's added really powerful bad guys with their own evil agenda tied to international bad guy Saddam Hussein -- there's the kidnapping of a very rich and powerful man's only child -- and he's even given his readers an insider's look at the true seat of power within Washington's beltway.<br />The terms &quot;page turner&quot; and &quot;heart stopper&quot; are overused in the publishing world, but they're the words that come to mind after finishing this story!<br />I read the book in one sitting -- didn't plan it that way, but once started, I could not put the darn thing down.<br />I'm very curious to know how quickly Hollywood will snap up the film rights!  It'll make a blockbuster, for certain!<br />Buy this book.  Then, tell all your friends and relatives to buy the book.  The reading world needs more writers like Steven Samuel!<br />Enjoy!	2001-01-05

I like the interaction between people and animals and I love that the animals usually figure out something's amiss long before their human counterpoints catch on.<br />OUTFOXED tells the story of a murder in the genteel Virginia countryside amidst the rigid regulations of the fox hunting crowd.  While I enjoyed the story, I felt she gave her reader entirely too much information on every single detail of the hunt, the attire, the horses and the hounds.  I'd be worn out before I ever cleared the first fence if I participated in the sport.<br />If you're interested, this book could certainly serve as a primer on the equine etiquette of the hunt.

She lives in a fabulous house on a picturesque island atop a cliff overlooking the ocean; she has two beautiful children; her husband is a physician. Something, is terribly wrong in her world, however. Patricia's husband is a cruel, manipulative and controlling wife beater.<br /><br />Bette Nordberg's book is an interesting mix of inspirational and psychological fiction. Patricia finds a friend on the island who gently nudges her toward God. By finding religion, Patricia develops the courage to leave the abusive situation and begin again.<br /><br />The danger in this kind of story is that it might wind up in the hands of an abused woman, who would read it and end up believing God is a way out of the situation -- and the danger in that scenario is that she might be trading one crutch (the abusive husband) for another. This in no way means I have anything against a personal relationship with a higher spiritual being -- it's just very dangerous to assume that God is going to protect you from a flying coffee cup or a clenched fist.<br /><br />Having worked with abused women for many years, I have learned to avoid relying on blanket answers like religion, psychological jargon or even cliched platitudes like &quot;you can do anything you set your mind to do.&quot; While I believe Ms. Nordberg meant well by offering hope to those in abusive relationships, I wish Patricia's character had found the way to inner strength and self-reliance without leaning so heavily on her friend Susan and her newly found relationship with God.<br /><br />This book was just a bit too much of a Pollyana's view of spousal abuse. The stories of those who have survived situations like Patricia's are more complicated and might not be as neatly ended, but I think they serve as a much more realistic portrait of what happens when a woman finds the courage to leave.	2000-12-23

She rebelled against her upbringing, she marched on Washington and had a baby out of wedlock long before it was acceptable in social circles. She and her daughter, Dylan (after Bob, of course) are now living in Esmerelda, Florida, where Godiva works as the elementary school's custodian and makes beautiful boxes that are sold by a local art dealer. Dylan is a bit embarrassed by her eccentric mother, but adjusts to life in a small town.<br /><br />Godiva's life takes a bizarre turn when she is the first person at an accident involving two local boys and their bicycles. Godiva comforts the boys, rides to the hospital with them and develops an affinity with the one who is seriously hurt. She is also attracted to the father of the second boy -- he's married, but she can't resist the seductive pull of his crooked smile.<br /><br />Dylan's life makes an abrupt turn of its own when she discovers a photograph -- taken from the WANTED posters at the local post office -- of the man she believes to be her father. Being the resourceful child that she is, she implements an elaborate plan to find him and get some questions answered.<br /><br />Liza Nelson has written a stellar debut novel about responsibility, family and finding our place in the universe.

Their book, THE CULTURAL CREATIVES - HOW 50 MILLION PEOPLE ARE CHANGING THE WORLD - is a guidebook for those who are interested in saving the planet, nurturing their personal relationships, and being sensitive without being stomped on.  <br /> You might be a Cultural Creative if you're into: books and music; arts and culture; stories; social causes, especially issues dealing with women and children; and authenticity. The authors have created an interesting test to gauge where you stand in the mix and use a lot of graphs throughout the book to identify cultural creatives and their issues.  <br /> If you're from the '60s and you've ever wondered what to do with all the energy created during that period of our lives, this book will open your eyes. If you've sometimes felt like an alien in your own family, the authors will offer you comfort because you're not alone. Even if you're just wondering why cultural creatives are so passionate about their lives, this planet, and their causes, this book will help you put it all together.  <br /> Cultural Creatives include such personalities as: Pope John Paul XXIII; Martin Luther King, Jr.; The Dalai Lama; Annie Dillard; Georgia O'Keeffe; Marc Chagall; Yo-Yo Ma; Robert Redford; Katharine Hepburn; and Bill Moyers. Pretty good company, don't you think?  <br /> While the book represents a lot of research on the part of the authors, the data is never presented in a dry, boring format. I found it hard to put the book down. The information resonated with me -- I'm from the 60's -- and it gave me hope for the future of our species and our planet.  <br /> Enjoy!	2000-12-12

While it's not clear how much truth Merrell uses in this account of murder, espionage, family relationships and redemption, he casts a seductive spell that keeps the reader entranced from first page to last.<br /> For the murder mystery, Merrell taps into every small town's worst fear: During the past year, four young girls have been brutally murdered in the small county in and around Mapletown City, Utah. One murder occurs within the city limits, much to the alarm of its citizens and dedicated police force. The only link to the murders is that all the victims had long dark hair.<br /> On routine patrol one night, Mapletown City Police Officer Rick Stacey and his faithful K-9 partner, Sig, foil an attempted kidnapping and murder of another dark-haired child. Sig chases the attacker away before the girl is seriously harmed.<br /> Stacey and Sig's heroics do not go unnoticed by Mapletown's belligerent Captain Bingham, a retired military man, transplanted from the east and hired over the more qualified, more experienced and definitely more popular Detective Kiser &quot;Deek&quot; Derickson. Derickson is Officer Stacey's hero, mentor and friend.<br /> When Deek ends up taking a bullet in the police parking lot, Officer Stacey's life unravels before his eyes. Framed for the shooting, and set up to take a fall with 2 kilos of heroin in his possession, Stacey must use his considerable skills to get to the bottom of Deek's shooting, to restore his reputation, and to save his life.<br /> It's at this point that the author adds espionage and chemical terrorism to the plot. What are federal agents and high tech surveillance equipment doing in tiny Mapletown City? Who's watching and why?<br /> For the family part of this story, the author introduces Don Rodriguez and his young daughter Christina. Don has just been released from county lock-up, with the understanding that is to get a job and put his life back on track. Don's wandering wife Monica has taken off for parts unknown, so he has to pull himself together for his daughter's. Having no place to stay, Don and Christina end up living with Monica's sister, Kate.<br /> Don sets out to find employment and a place to live. He lands a job with Cobblecrete doing hard but honest labor. He even finds a love interest in Cecily, the company's delightfully upbeat receptionist.<br /> Don locates an apartment not too far from his sister-in-law's, where the landlord is willing to waive the deposit if Don can come up with the first month's rent.<br /> There is a problem, however. The landlord, Melvin Briggs is a creepy guy who lurks in the shadows, owns very sophisticated computer equipment and who hides a host of dangerous secrets.<br /> When Briggs is arrested for attempting to kidnap and kill Christina, the plot gets thicker than split pea soup. However, the reader who stays with Merrell through to the last page is rewarded by a wild roller coaster ride, filled with real people who face life and death situations, who learn lessons in forgiveness, and who are ultimately redeemed.<br /> While his seemingly disjointed style might be a bit unsettling at first, the author methodically unfolds his plots with much care and consideration. Even though the characters seem to follow parallel lines during much of the story, Merrell brings them together for a very satisfying and somewhat surprising ending.<br /> Enjoy!derstanding that is to get a job and put his life back on track.

He's just lost his wife after a lengthy battle with cancer; he's being stalked by the brother of a man he successfully prosecuted and sent to death; and his young daughter sees her dead mother everywhere. After a particularly heart-wrenching experience at Disney World, he scoops his daughter into his arms and heads for the only place where he can find peace: HOME. <br />   Home is Natchez, Mississippi. <br />   Home is where his father, sixty-six year old Dr. Tom Cage, is still practicing down home medicine, complete with house calls and no HMO's. &quot;My parents started life with nothing, and in a single generation, though hard work and sacrifice, lived what was once unapologetically called the American Dream.&quot;<br />    Home is where his mother longs to help her son and her granddaughter heal. Peggy Cage is &quot;...a girl who made the social journey from the 4-H Club to the Garden Club without forgetting her roots. She could take tea with royalty and commit no faux pas, yet just as easily twist the head off a banty hen, boil the bristles off a hog, or kill an angry copperhead.&quot; <br />   Home is where the Cage's beloved family maid, Ruby Flowers, waits: &quot;Ruby Flowers came to work for us in 1963 and, except for one life-threatening illness, never missed a single workday until arthritis forced her to slow down thirty years later.&quot; <br />   Home is where Cage and Annie can find peace and recover from their loss. <br />   Or is it? <br />   &quot;Natchez is unlike any place in America, existing almost outside time.....In some ways it isn't part of Mississippi at all....Natchez exists in a ripple of time that somehow eludes the homogenizing influence of the present.&quot; <br />   Upon his arrival at the Cage home, Penn immediately suspects that something is seriously wrong. His father has been cashing in largeCD's and cannot account for the money's whereabouts. When Penn finally figures out the reason, his determination to clear his father's name leads him into a hornet's nest of deceit, greed, and a 30-year old murder case. <br />   Before the 559-page book ends, no one escapes unscathed. Penn's parents must relive a particularly difficult time in their lives. Penn's values and judgment are challenged to the extreme. He also has to deal with Olivia Marston, his long lost love and the unanswered questions surrounding his feelings for her. And, at the core of this story lies the underbelly of Natchez' racial history which is exposed in the most unflattering way possible.<br />    The local police and the FBI enter the fray, making for a hair-raising, spine-tingling, thought-provoking read that doesn't let up from the first page until the last.<br />    This was my first Greg Iles book, but I can promise you, it won't be my last. Iles has a gift for suspense, introspection and characterization like no other writer around today. He's been compared to John Grisham, but I think he's in a league of his own. <br />He's a young man and THE QUIET GAME is only his 4th novel. With any luck, we'll be hearing about Greg Iles for years to come. <br />   Enjoy! <br />	2000-11-26

Barrington is not a perfectly sculpted hero with a dazzling smile and impeccable manners.

Stone solves the mystery, but it's never quite that simple with a Woods book.  There are twists and turns and sub-plots to spice things up and there's more than enough interaction between Stone and the fairer sex to heat up the pages.<br />Stuart Woods is a master of his craft.

Even if you do not hold Shirley MacLaine's New Age beliefs and philosophy of life, her newest book, THE CAMINO, is a fascinating read. The fact that a celebrity in her 6th decade would set out on a 500 mile walk, by herself, in a foreign country is intriguing enough.<br />On two separate occasions, while performing in Brazil, MacLaine received unsigned notes strongly urging her to take a pilgrimage called the Santiago de Compostela Camino across northern Spain. She knew of the Camino, as it is called, but had difficulty in visualizing herself hiking her way through it.<br />Upon further study and the help of a Brazilian friend named Anna Strong who had made the Camino journey herself, MacLaine decided she had nothing to lose and just might gain some further insight into her life and the state of the world.<br />MacLaine's story is very compelling and makes for a very fast read. Of course, there are tales of MacLaine's past lives with Charlemange and Giant Moors and as a wild young gypsy woman, but there is also, at the heart of the book, a wonderful story of a woman's determination to finish a journey and to be open to what the universe had planned for her. I was particularly struck by the clever way she dealt with the ever-present hoards of press that seemed to dog her every step.<br />This is a book worth reading. Take from it what you will, Shirley MacLaine is one tough cookie. I'd hike the mountains with her any day!<br />Enjoy!	2000-11-08

You stare at the man you love and you are staring at nothing: he is gone before he is gone.&quot;<br />So begins the first paragraph of Elizabeth Berg's new novel, OPEN HOUSE.<br />OPEN HOUSE tells the story of a marriage breaking up, a heart splitting in two, and of finding one's self again.<br />Samantha and her 11-year-old Travis are sent reeling when Sam's husband and Travis' father leaves. Even though he was not a particulary good mate to Sam or attentive parent to Travis, there was a type of security in their routines.<br />After Sam realizes David is leaving, she spends an obscene amount of money at Tiffany's in a scene that was hilarious and quite sad at the same time.<br />After the shopping spree, David limits Sam's access to his finanaces. In order to make ends meet and to stay in their home, Sam rents out rooms and takes on temporary jobs. Her world begins to expand as she not only opens her house, but her heart to new experiences.<br />If you've ever lost a love, dealt with a teen-ager, entered the dating game after 30, reconciled with a prickly parent, or devoured an entire box of chocolates at one sitting, then you'll relate to Sam and her story.<br />Berg is a particulary gifted writer with an almost uncanny ability to see into the very core of her characters and bring that center to the surface. She has been a favorite since her wonderful TALK BEFORE SLEEP. She did not disappoint this time, either. I read the book in one sitting and was never bored nor did I feel manipulated for even one paragraph. I found myself rooting for Sam, Travis, Lydia, Edward and King...they are people I'd like to know.<br />Enjoy!	2000-11-01

The book's dust jacket describes Nora as a 'prickly, strong-willed survivor of the Holocaust.' Nora and her mesmerizing daughter-in-law Louisa arrive in Haifa after the war, ready to begin a new life.<br />Before a new life can be started, however, Nora and Louisa must review their pasts and resolve complex issues of their lives together and their lives apart.<br />Nora's one true love was her cousin Bela. They had a close relationship as children and when Bela immigrated to Israel, Nora was devastated. She marries and has a son, Gabor, but she never forgets the love of her life.<br />Louisa came from an upper-class German family and enjoyed a protected childhood. Her world is turned upside down when she meets Gabor, a poor but gifted young man. Louisa's relationship with Gabor borders on the obsessed, but they eventually marry.<br />After the war, Nora and Louisa go to Israel to find Bela. Both women must be very resourceful to survive in this new land. The non-Jewish Louisa is suspect in the holding camp, but Nora defends her presence by repeating: 'She saved my life.' Nora spent many months during Nazi occupation of Budapest in Louisa's basement and feels an obligation for Louisa, but not much more.<br />The author tells the story of these two women by moving back and forth from past to present and from Nora to Louisa. The effect is sometimes disconcerting and waiting for the entire story to unfold is sometimes frustrating. I was never sure why the author chose to title the book LOUISA, as the story is ultimately Nora's.<br />On a more positive note, the book offers a look at life in Budapest before the war and it offers an intense look at early life in Israel and would prove educational to anyone interested in that time period	2000-10-02

Time does not diminish true talent and Dinesen had talent to let.  With every re-read, I am transported to a magical place and another time.<br />It's difficult to find truly magical prose in today's publications.  Recently, I was hungry for some poetic fiction and pulled this volume from  my bookshelf. I'm so glad I did.<br />Karen Blixen writes with true insight  and an artist's approach about her beloved farm in Africa. There's a  paragraph where she wonders if Africa knows of her like she knows of  Africa. What other author has ever asked that question? She also details  the migration of buffalo, elephant and antelope with such majesty that the  mind's eye can almost see the dust rise from under their hooves.<br />If  you're looking for a satisfying story that will entertain you for many  nights, read &quot;Out of Africa.&quot; You will not be disappointed.	2000-09-19

Zoe Kergulin, private investigator extraordinaire, is still recovering from the death of a dear friend and her ouster from the Justice Department.  She's living in a quaint Queen Anne house in West Virginia, surrounded by  friends and family.<br />Zoe's cousin, Sheriff Ethan McKenna, and a female  deputy are ambushed, leaving the deputy dead and Ethan hanging on to life.  Rumors spread through Bickle County and they aren't pretty.  Everywhere Zoe  turns, there are whispers of an illicit affair.  The deputy's husband is  arrested for the crimes.  Zoe knows there was no affair, but to openly tell  the truth would ruin Ethan's career.<br />Ethan McKenna is gay.<br />Zoe must  find the real criminals and save her cousin's reputation.  During her  investigation, Zoe stumbles upon a frustrated undercover narcotics agent, a  trouble teen, and a mystery man who is scouring the county in his silver  Jaguar. Zoe's tenaciousness is almost her undoing, but she is determined to  find the killers, clear her cousin's name and bring some closure to a  painful chapter in her family's history.<br />This is a pleasant night's  entertainment.  I wish the author would have given us more insight into  Ethan and his personal life, but I suppose that will be another story.<br />Enjoy!	2000-09-03
US	52958253	RUGJTN774XU59	1886199108	570008120	Final Cut	Books	3	3	3	N	N	A pleasant debut.	Margot O'Banion Lake's ability to translate a writer's thoughts,  a director's vision, and an actor's lines into a work of art has earned her a  well-deserved reputation as one of the best film editors in  Tinseltown.<br />In her series debut, FINAL CUT, the reserved and reticent  Margot and her flamboyant lover and business partner, director Max Skull,  make a trip to northern California to the ranch home of the late, legendary  film editor Amory Evans.  Max needs the rugged scenery of the high desert  for his final shots.  Margot will use the quiet atmosphere of Evans' studio  to work her magic on the film.  <br />Immediately upon their arrival at  Palisades Ranch, the duo are caught off guard by Evans' widow and her twin  sister.  Leticia Evans and Bernice Sweet are two interchangeable peas in a  pod.  They are warm and welcoming, but Margot senses an uncomfortable  underlying current she cannot explain.  Something isn't quite right.  <br />As  they begin to work on the film, Margot and Max have some pretty strange  experiences.  They are housed in a worn down guest house while the twins  live in luxury at the main house.  Security cameras watch their every move.   An entire film crew gets lost on the location.  A van blows up.  People  disappear for stretches at a time and return with no memory of what  happened during their absence.   The ranch's handyman appears out of  nowhere to stalk their movements.  A black cat weaves in and out of the  scenery, even though they are banned from the ranch.  Pieces of animal fur  are stuck under mattresses.  Articles are rearranged.  <br />Someone doesn't  want Max and Margot to complete their work. <br />Is it the twins?  Is it  their peculiar handy man, Johnny Pine?  Is it the studio's axe man, Adrian  Browning?  Or could it be the ghost of Amory Evans?  The answers will  surprise even the most jaded mystery fan!<br />The author falls a bit short in  technique:  (1) stretching what would have been a quality short story into  192 pages; (2) abusing the word &quot;prickled&quot; when referring to the  many times Margot's skin reacts to fright; and (3) inserting unnecessary  'that' into an infinite number of sentences.  <br />The basic story line is  solid, however, and the author lays the groundwork for more Margot O'Banion  Mysteries.	2000-09-03

The first time I finished this book was at 4:00 in the morning. I promptly  threw it across the room and cried until dawn. The second time I read  &quot;Father Loss,&quot; I dog eared the upper right hand corner of the  pages I liked. The third time I read it, I dog eared the bottom right hand  corners of the pages that interested me. After that, I took to highlighting  the important paragraphs. My copy of &quot;Father Loss&quot; is all but  mangled, but I will not give it up.<br />Since 1985, I've purchased countless  copies for women friends with similar backgrounds. You should read the  thank you notes I've received...they're full of praise for Wakerman's  masterpiece.<br />This book helped me to understand why I behave the way I  do. It also gave me comfort in the knowledge that I was not alone in my  suffering and that my anguish was real and worthy of attention. Although  nothing will replace the black hole in my heart left by my father's death,  &quot;Father Loss&quot; was the most important tool in my recovery and my  path to a healthier relationship with men.<br />A must-have for any woman who  has lost her father to death, divorce or abandonment.

To truly experience Alice Hoffman's work, you need the ability to  suspend all rational thought for a bit.  Hoffman's tales are conjured with  both a writer's voice and a magician's wand.  She is never boring.<br />In THE  RIVER KING, Ms. Hoffman tells the story of a small town in  Massachusetts...she divides the town into the haves and the have nots.  An  elite private school adds to the class distinctions.<br />When one of Haddan  School's students is found drowned in the troubled Haddan River, city and  students alike are effected.<br />Haddan School's own troubled past becomes  part of Hoffman's tapestry.  The fragrance of roses appears in the middle  of winter.  Fish appear out of nowhere.  The dead boy's image shows up in  photographs. Bees swarm in October.  Mysterious illness strikes students.  No one rests until the mystery is solved.<br />THE RIVER KING is one of  Hoffman's best efforts.  It is not light, easy, summertime reading.  It is  to be savored and will linger with you long after you've finished.  Like  Hoffman's past work, some mysteries are solved.  Some will never  be.<br />That's what it's like to read a good Alice Hoffman story.<br />Enjoy!	2000-08-27

In his second Jack Merlin Mystery series, physician/author James Tucker  has penned another hit!<br />From the first page until the last, Tucker pulls  his readers into a tale of galloping corporate greed, professional  treachery and murder most foul. Dr. Tucker knows his way around a hospital,  a murder and he's well on his way to becoming quite a storyteller, too.<br />In HOCUS CORPUS, Jack Merlin has been promoted to chief resident at the  prestigious Pittsburgh University Medical Center. He's still practicing  magic and charming his patients. His relationship with Assistant District  Attorney and fellow crime solver has progressed smoothly and things are  going his way.<br />However, Jack's orderly life begins to unwind when he  loses a young patient after a relatively simple procedure. The child's  powerful father holds Jack responsible for her death and Jack must once  again prove his innocence and find out who's behind the tragedy.<br />While  trying to solve the child's death, Jack discovers a pattern in several  unexpected and completely unnecessary patient deaths. Patients make it  through surgery but die of massive infections just days later.<br />As they  dig further into the mysterious deaths, Jack and Tory uncover a diabolical  plot involving involves crooks of the worst kind, insurance companies and  ruthless men who will stop at nothing to line their own pockets with the  misery of others. How Tucker keeps all the story lines headed toward a  plausible and ultimately satisfying ending is quite impressive.<br />I look  forward to more Jack Merlin mysteries.<br />And, as mentioned by others, I  don't think I'll be eating any Jell-O for a long, long time!<br />Enjoy!	2000-08-06

In fact, she has a best seller on her hands until page 230, when an implausible plot line takes an abrupt turn south and crashes the story, the character and  the author's credibility.<br />Woodruff's story begins with the Breeze family  of Sheldrake, CT.  Jennie Breeze has a pretty good life as a wife and  mother in the tony suburbs.  Her husband runs a landscaping business and  their teen-age daughter, Tara, is making it through the difficult years  with relative ease.  As Tara's school year ends, the family is awaiting a  new addition, and unlike Tara, who was not planned and not expected, this  baby is welcomed and wanted.<br />When Jennie goes into labor, she insists  that Tara be with her at the hospital, thus spoiling the girl's plans to go  out with her two best friends and the 'new' boy in town, Matt Fallon.<br />Tara's absence doesn't stop the three other kids from heading off to an  unsupervised teen party.  The girls get wasted, leaving driving duties to  the ever-responsible, but inexperienced Matt. A horrific accident occurs  when Matt's limited driving skills fail him, and Tara's two best friends  are killed. Matt walks away, but is left with some very serious  psychological wounds.<br />When school lets out, no one enjoys the summer  break.  Jennie is suffering from the new baby blues. Her start-up business  that plans high school reunions is not as organized as she would like, but  she just can't seem to find the time or the energy to deal with the new  baby and plan a party.  Jennie's husband is headed into his busy time of  the year and can offer little relief. Tara is inconsolable over the loss of  her two best friends. Matt is ostracized by the community, who holds him  responsible for the tragedy.<br />Jennie knows something about being an  outcast.  She graduated valedictorian of her class, but wound up pregnant  and married before she turned 19.  Realizing Matt's situation, she offers  him a job as her assistant for the summer months. Though tenuous at first,  the boy and the woman work well together.  Jennie has a lot of basic  maternal instincts and a knack for knowing how to help Matt deal with his  guilt. In turn, Matt gets Jennie organized for the summer's events and,  with Jennie's care, he begins to find his way back from a self-imposed  purgatory.<br />Woodruff's debut was stunning until page 230, when she throws  in what I think is a very inappropriate plot twist.  Besides having an  element of sheer surprise, the author raises issues that are just too  complex to resolve before the story ends at page 256.  I finished the book  feeling ambushed, exhausted, and cheated out of a good story.<br />Woodruff  has a gift with prose and probably has a bright future as a writer.

I laughed all the way through the book and learned a lot  along the way.  Think Hunter Thompson, drugs and all, writing about the  restaurant business.  <br />I learned that running a restaurant is not for the  faint of heart.  Just hauling all the bloody meat carcasses around would be  enough to turn your stomach.  Learning to carve the beef, fish, poultry and  lamb would put me off the job right away.  The pressure of turning out 600+  dinners in an evening is daunting.  <br />Paying the bills, keeping the  nut-case employees happy, knowing which Italian family currently controls  disposal of waste, and trying to stay on top of the ever changing and  always fickle American palette is enough to make anyone's head spin.   <br />The leveling factor, or so it seems, is chemicals -- and lots of them.   I don't think Bourdain has drawn a completely sober breath since he first  stepped into a commercial kitchen at the Dreadnaught in Provincetown, Cape  Cod.  When they weren't drinking up profits from the Dreadnaught's bar,  they were high on coke, LSD, mushrooms laced with honey, and finally,  heroin.  <br />As Bourdain explains: <br />So who the hell, exactly, ARE these  guys, the boys and girls in the trenches?  You might get the impression  from the specifics of MY less than stellar career that all line cooks are  wacked-out moral degenerates, dope fiends, refugees, a thuggish assortment  of drunks, sneak thieves, sluts and psychopaths.  You wouldn't be too far  off base.<br />After reading this riotous tale, I've made some changes in my  dining out behaviors.  I will not eat fish on Mondays.  I won't &quot;do  brunch.&quot;  I will schedule my dining excursions for weekdays, not  weekends.  I will never order anything well done and I won't insult the  chef by asking for sauce &quot;on the side.&quot;  I will sit at the bar  and watch what comes out of the kitchen before ordering.  I will skip lunch  and save my appetite for dinner.  Also, on my next trip to New York, I will  make reservations Bourdain's restaurant, Brasserie Les Halles...for Tuesday  night, of course!<br />If you want to know WHY I've changed my routines, read  this book.  You'll learn some interesting facts and chances are, you'll  laugh a lot during the process.<br />Enjoy!	2000-07-03

The story is reminiscent of 'A River Runs Through It' because, try as he  might, the older brother cannot save his beloved sibling from his  destiny.<br />I read this book in one sitting, and was completely blown away  by the ending.

I don't know why 'Diana Diamond' didn't use her real name for this book -- unless she feared it might keep us away from her 'real' work.<br />I didn't much care for this book, as I found nothing compelling about any of the  characters.  In one way or the other, they were all spoiled by their  success, money and possessions. I couldn't even be very sympathetic to  Emily, the kidnapped spouse, because she herself was cheating.<br />One of the  characteristics of a crafty mystery writer is his/her ability to keep the  reader guessing 'who done it'.  In this case, I figured out the 'bad' guy  way too soon.<br />All in all, not a very satisfying read.  Too bad, because  the premise had promise...just not in THIS author's hands.	2000-06-30

As a child of the '60's myself, I could relate to Celia's reluctance to marry and settle down.<br />I really liked this book, with all its craziness.  I tried -- once -- to make a family tree, just to keep track of the  men/children/etc who came and went during Celia's life, but I gave up.<br />I  like this author and would read her again. Her writing is much like how I  think, so I didn't consider it sloppy, as one reviewer did. I understood  Celia perfectly.<br />Enjoy!	2000-06-27

This was my first Elizabeth Adler book, so unlike other reviewers here, I had nothing to compare this story to.<br />I liked the combination of legal professor Marla and ex-cop-turned P.I. Griaud, but like others here, I felt  their many sex scenes were just so much fluff. After the first one, where  the author shows how much they care about each other, the rest were pretty  much just for show.<br />Also, Pepperdine is a Church of Christ school, so I'm  not so sure they'd let Marla and her skimpy skirts past the guard gate, let  alone teach a class!<br />I liked the premise of a femal being the heavy for  a change, but the overall plotlines were pretty jaded and trite for my  tastes.<br />I am a fan of Los Angeles and I liked reading about places I've  visited.  So, all in all, I spent a peaceful summer's night with a so-so  book.  Not great, but better than channel surfing!	2000-06-25

I know all fiction cannot have happy, neatly tied-up endings, but this one blew me away.<br />I found myself challenged by this story, and really didn't figure out who the killer was until it was almost upon me.<br />The  author does a good job in developing her characters and making her reader  CARE about them.  Nalen Storrow is one of the most desperate humans I've  found in recent fiction.  I rooted for him to find the retarded girl's  killer and I despaired with him as he fought ugly, black moods that he  could not control.<br />I liked his daughter, Rachel, too.  I wished happiness  for her, but it was not to be.<br />This book kept me in suspense until the  final page...and I do mean the final page....it's a stunner.<br />The only  reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was I felt there were way too many  red herrings offered to the reader before the true evil -- and its  motivation -- were revealed.<br />Enjoy!	2000-06-22

I liked this book about Kate Martinelli, a San Francisco cop with a penchant for getting in over her head.<br />I probably would have liked it more, however, if I had done what I advise my readers to do:  read the  series in the order they are published. I would be more familiar with Kate  and Lee and the life they're trying to make for each other.<br />A lot of  the author's time and ink are spent on internal issues like relationships;  family; theology; and there is a more than occasional feminist theme in her  work.<br />Spousal abuse and the overall degredation of women are this  story's themes, and it sometimes seems the author feels obliged to club her  reader over the head time and again with how UNempowered (is there such a  word?) women still are.<br />I'll probably read more Kate Martinelli  books...I'll just go back to the beginning and play catch up first.<br />Enjoy!	2000-06-21

There is no obvious line of demarcation  between good and bad in this book.  It's just not that simple.<br />Morris  has created a family with such complex and compelling characters that --  gosh -- they could be real.<br />I'll be recommending this story to my  reading buddies.

The plot was way too convoluted for my tastes,  and, like other  reviewers here, I thought the author worked too hard to make the dialogue  &quot;cute.&quot;<br />This is the first Bernie Rhodenbarr Mystery I've read.

I liked this book for what it is:  a piece of summertime fantasy that's been spiced with a bit of the supernatural for interest.<br />Aspiring physician Lauren Kline survives a car wreck, only to be put into a  seemingly irreversible coma.  After six months, Lauren learns how to take  her spirit out of her body and move around.  One of her favorite places to  visit is her beloved apartment overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge in San  Francisco.<br />The only problem with Lauren's ability to move about is that  no one sees her, leaving her without human interaction. That is, until  Arthur, the architect who rents her apartment and finds her hiding in a  closet.<br />The remainder of the short book deals with Lauren and Arthur's  inevitable romance, complete with an eerie kidnapping.<br />It's not Proust,  but it provided me with a good night's read.<br />Enjoy!	2000-06-05

Personally, I could never get past all the purchased (read: wigs) hair Buchanan wears for interviews and book tours, so I just didn't take  her seriously enough to purchase her work.<br /> The lady's obviously very  bright, having won the Pulitzer, and she has the experience and talent to  write about the underbelly of Miami, so why hide under all that obviously  fake hair?<br />With that said....<br />I read the liner notes for this book  and was intrigued that the serial killer was female and very, very good at  what she does.<br />I disagree with Montero's decision that there is an  &quot;evil&quot; gene. Mabye it was the sex at six years old that turned  Keppie...or her mother's past....or the fact that she grew up unloved and  unwanted...or maybe she saw what her mother did to those men...or mabye it  was the taunt of the kids at school that first gave her the lust for  blood.<br />I didn't have sympathy for Keppie, but I could certainly  understand how she might be wired differently from the rest of the world.<br />I read the book in one sitting, and although I had some serious doubt  about Britt's reluctance to free herself from the hostage situation, I  liked the story and look forward to reading more about Britt's life as a  reporter in a city that certainly contains a lot of dark and humid secrets  yet to be told.<br />Enjoy!	2000-06-03

For a person who doesn't read much non-fiction, this book is a bit overwhelming.  With that said, it should be said that this book is also one of the most thoroughly researched books I've read on Virginia  Woolf.<br />Woolf is one of my favorite authors. I hadn't been too interested  in her life until I read Michael Cunningham's 'The Hours'.  Since that  time, I've read what I could find about her life, but nothing compares to  this volume, for sheer quantity of research, notes and professional  opinions.<br />I found this book in a Bargain Rack.  I'm sorry it's out of  print.  It would make a fabulous research tool for any student of Woolf, or  of the Victorian Age.	2000-05-26

I was as enchanted with his real life story as I have been by the characters he's played on film and the stage.<br />It's a cliche, to be sure, but Poitier's  parents gave him a great gift:  roots and wings.  As a child growing up on  Cat Island, in the Bahamas, he gained the self-confidence and security he  would have to call upon time and again during his adult life.  He never  strayed too far from the values he learned so early on, and even though he  livesin a world very far removed from the one he was born into, the apple  doesn't fall too far from the tree.<br />I enjoyed the book and will  probably read it again.  Thank you, Mr. Poitier, for your grace,  strength,incredible talent, and for sharing your life with us.<br />Enjoy!	2000-05-21

I've been a Stuart Woods fan since NEW YORK DEAD and SANTA FE RULES.<br />I believe THE RUN is his best effort yet. This story about an honorable man's run for the Presidency is dead to rights.  Although Woods  acknowledges help from a Deputy Press Secretary in Ted Kennedy's office,  he must have had other sources within the beltway because he misses  nothing.<br />I didn't finish this book in one sitting because I wanted it to  last.  I hope we Woods' fans will have the opportunity to read more about  William Henry Lee IV, his terrific wife, Kate, and his sharp-as-tacks  parents. His presidency should be interesting.<br />This is a winner.<br />Enjoy!	2000-05-19

I've given countless copies  away to friends who then give copies to their friends.<br />When  &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; was first published, an elderly  relative told me Bach was the devil incarnate.  Imagine what she'd say  about THIS one!<br />I've not had the good fortune to run across a Donald  Shimoda-like character, but I think I'd be ready to hear what he said.<br />Two quotes from Shimoda's 'The Messiah's Handbook and Reminders for the  Advanced Soul' are worth repeating:<br />Your friends will know you better  in the first minute you meet them than your acquaintences will know you in  a thousand years.<br />and<br />The bond that links your true family is not one  of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life....Rarely do members  of one family grow up under the same roof.<br />This book has been a great  gift to me and I'm thankful it found me!<br />Enjoy!	2000-05-17

I read the novel in one night and was completely spellbound by the story's main character and his search  for the truth about a woman he encounters in a San Francisco diner.<br />'Blue Lonesome's' prose had great flow and the character's struggle with  many issues really captured me.<br />This book, however, neither drew me in or  sustained my interest. True, the parallel stories angle was a good one, but  I knew from the get-go who was the bad guy and who was the good  guy.<br />Additionally, it seemed pretty easy for me to figure out all the  basic plot lines, too, and I think a good mystery writer should make his  reader work a bit to find all the threads that hold his tapestry/tale  together.<br />I hope the author will do more work and write more quality  stories, like 'Blue Lonesome', for I really like his style and his ability  to develop interesting characters.  He just didn't do it for me in this  one.<br />Try 'Blue Lonesome' for a good study in character, choice and  chaos.	2000-05-03

Yes,  they're younger than the ladies in 'The First Wives' Club,' but I felt  their stories were very much the same.<br />I think this writer has a lot of  insight into women and ALL their relationships, but I wish she'd dig a  little deeper and find something other than revenge to satisfy her plot  demands.<br />Enjoy!	2000-04-26

I knew all there was to know about  Phiz and knew what his ultimate fate would be, but never saw enough of  Kevin's character -- other than a through Phiz' reflection -- to know much  about it...and therefore, to care much about him.<br />I'm not into the  business of rock and roll, but I now feel I know how to 'get recorded.'<br />One other note:  If you decide to read this book, you might want to  watch 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' prior to starting.  The  author leans heavily on the movie for plot, sub-plot and climatic moments.  It's been a while since I've seen it, so many of those moments went right  over my head.<br />It's a good start and the author seems to really have a  feel for the time period covered in the story.<br />Enjoy!	2000-04-10

I must preface this review by saying I just returned from a week in Savannah...I did all the tourist things...even took &quot;The Book&quot; tour...<br />I've just re-read &quot;The Book&quot; for the third time and  find it even more compelling, charming and utterly delightful than  before.<br />As for its detractors, maybe this is a Southern thing, as we do  celebrate our more colorful characters down here...my town's character  doesn't collect insects, but he rides a bicycle, sits on Main Street all  day, waves at everyone and knows their children...and yes, there are people  who are one step ahead of their creditors, but I don't think they have tour  buses stopping at their houses for lunch and the occasional hair cut.  And  no one I've ever known has taken a visitor to a cemetary, no matter how  pretty is was, for chicken salad sandwiches and martinis.<br />I don't think  the Married Women's Card Club could have survived for all these years if it  were located say, in Chicago or St. Paul.  It takes years of strict social  standards to keep such rituals as when to serve water and when to  &quot;pass the linen&quot; alive.  The Olgelthorpe Club, Savannah Yacht  Club (and its cousins) are still alive and well in the South, and have not  yielded to outside pressures to become politically correct.<br />The charm  and the underbelly of Savannah is real...Berendt captured it on paper and I  saw it first hand.<br />I've never &quot;fallen&quot; for a city like I did  for Savannah and, had it not been for &quot;The Book,&quot; I would have  never visited.<br />From what I read and what I learned on my trip, Jim  Williams would have reveled in the spotlight of &quot;The Book.&quot;  I'm  sure he's looking down (or up, depending on your point of view) and  enjoying every snapshot the tourists take of Mercer House.

Their romance seemed perfectly plausible to me.<br />As for some  reviewers dislike for the ending:  I knew the lion was going to  escape...how else could there be a sequel...?<br />Anyway, I'm glad  DeMille's back at the top of his game and I loved the story...that eerie  landing of the 747 and the deathly discovery nailed me to the chair.<br />Enjoy!	2000-03-06

I hope Martini doesn't turn into one of those best selling novelists who begins to believe his own publicity and lets his storytelling slide.<br />This book is not representative of the fine work that Martini has done in the past.

What's up with that?<br />I'm glad Madrini's moved south...the change seems to suit  him.

I'm looking forward to reading more Den of Antiquity  mysteries.<br />I like the wit and dry humor of Tamar Myers...she makes me  laugh out loud...<br />Enjoy!	2000-02-17

I  am simply not interested in the world of high finance.  It's hard to drum  up sympathy for someone whose net worth is around 29 million....	2000-02-17

I've read most of Scottoline's books and liked them.  They're not Grisham or Turow, but they're good for a couple of nights' reading.<br />This particular offering, however, never pulled me into the story, nor did I for  one minute believe that Bennie Rosato -- tough girl that she is -- would  fall for such a con artist as her &quot;twin&quot; sister...the entire  thing just didn't ring true.<br />And the stereotypes Scottoline used are so  tired and overdone.<br />I've worked for lawyers and am pretty sure that no  judge worth his robes would deny a continuance after an attorney's parent  died, so that part didn't work for me either.<br />I think Scottoline ought to  go back to what works for her rather than trying to turn out a book every 6  months or so.  Her writing, timing, plot development and characterizations  are suffering.	2000-02-15

I've always liked the crazy, mixed-up, slightly bent characters in Hiaasen's books, but this one left me wanting.<br />In this book, however, there wasn't enough insight into any of the characters (save the lobbyist's wife) to make me care what happened to them or to understand why they did  what they did.<br />Hiaasen has a good handle on the corrupt nature of  politics...I just think he missed the boat a bit with this effort.<br />I'll  still read his books.	2000-02-10

This book, however, is a trite, contrived, predictable, boiler-plate mess!<br />Nothing about the story really &quot;grabbed&quot; me and there was  nothing compelling me to continue, so about 3/4 of the way through, I just  quit.  I read the last three pages, and found out what I already knew would  happen...no surprises and certainly no interest for me.<br />Thrillers  should pull a reader in and not let go until the very end.  As thrillers  go, this was a dud.<br />Read some of the earlier works.  Don't waste your  time on this!	2000-01-29

Not because I had the extra time, but because I had to find out what happened to the hero....<br />The title is enough to intrigue, but the author also delivers a very good Japanese  bumpkin-comes-to-town-and comes-of-age story, complete with interesting  characters, vivid flashbacks and compelling plot lines.<br />Again, I wish  that sexual abuse weren't so crucial to modern stories.  I wish that  particular kind of evil didn't exist, but, since it does, authors seem to  be honing right in on it as the source of all of society's ills.<br />I will  read other stories by this fresh, new voice.  He's got a handle on modern  city life and he seems to know the pysches of those who live there.	2000-01-21

I read this book on the recommendation of some &quot;net buddies&quot; and I'm so glad I did.<br />Jim Messenger, a lonely CPA going nowhere either personally or professionally, notices a woman who frequents his favorite  San Francisco diner.  He notices that she is always alone, always eats the  same thing, and always avoids contact with other humans.  Messenger tags  her &quot;Ms. Blue Lonesome.&quot;<br /> His one-time attempt to make  conversation with her fails miserably, but she intrigues him.  When she  quits coming to the diner, Messenger finds out that she has committed  suicide and his life comes totally unhinged.<br />As he begins to unravel the  mystery of Ms. Blue Lonesome's true identity, he becomes more and more  obscessed with her life and her sad, blue lonesome story.<br />The only reason  I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that I'm really weary of childhood  sexual abuse being at the core of every book I read.  I hope that doesn't  give away too much, but I'm sick of being confronted with that kind of evil  everywhere I turn.<br />I liked the book, loved the writer's style and would  read him again.	2000-01-19

My husband found this book for me and I devoured it in one sitting.<br />Much like Truddi Chase, the body of Toni Beauchamp is occasionally inhabited by some very strange  characters.  In this story, however, the characters are inherited from her  mother, not as the result of child abuse, as in Chase's tale.  These  &quot;gods&quot; were Toni's mother's burden for years and when she dies,  they choose to take up residence in Toni's body.<br />The entire story is  well-written...and it was difficult for me to believe a male had written it  because of his great insight into the workings of the female mind.<br />I  liked the story and would read anything by this author again.<br />Enjoy!	2000-01-18

I rather liked the part of this novel that dealt with the historical...someone did a lot of research into French and medieval history.  However, the quantum physics were WAY over my grasp....I just  scanned those parts...kinda like I did in high school physics class.<br />This  was an interesting story with some provocative points to ponder.<br />I agree  with other reviewers....it will make a good film!<br />Enjoy!	2000-01-06

I liked all the characters, especially the saucy Sarah, who ultimately &quot;saves&quot; Elizabeth Hopper from a prison sentence.<br />I liked the courtroom scenes and I liked  the romance.

I was wrong.<br />Who really killed Cheryl?  What happened to that steriod-popping friend of hers and Chris'?  How did Terry expect to  hide her pregnancy from Chris?  What happened to the other men on the  Cheryl videos?  Did anyone actually see the Cheryl videos, or was Decker  just bluffing?  What actually went down when Decker got the promotion to  Lt?  Why didn't a tenacious copy like Decker follow-up on the  &quot;leads&quot; that pointed to Chris as his uncle's hit man?<br />I've  liked the other Decker books, but this one fell short for me. There were  just too many unanswered questions.	1999-12-13

I liked Billy, the title character of this story and rooted for him all the way through.  I liked the detective (Petra) who tries to find the young boy who witnesses a brutal murder.  I did not much care for the rest of the  characters and the predictable story line.  The red herrings didn't throw  me, either.<br />The victim was not very sympathetic and the villan was  pretty obvious from the beginning, but I didn't stop reading because I  liked following Billy through the mean streets of Los Angeles.<br />I'm sure  Hollywood will make this story into a movie...who will play Billy?  Petra?  The old Jewish man? The grandmother?<br />To me, it would have been a much  better ending if Billy had wound up with the Jewish man...they needed each  other and truly understood one another.<br />I liked this book and would  recommend it with some, but not much, hesitation.  I will go see the movie,  too.	1999-12-08

I started this book at 9:00 last night and finished, exhausted, at 1:35 a.m.!<br />Maybe the plot was a bit contrived, but I couldn't help getting  caught up in the web of the story...I kept thinking I'd quit after the next  paragraph, but I kept reading until the final page.<br />I liked Jesse  Warden and was rooting for him all the way....I liked the fact that Woods  showed Warden -- warts and all.  No, he wasn't perfect, and yes, he  probably would have killed Baker, but I might have done the very same  thing, had my life gone down the toilet like his!<br />I, too, would like to  see the movie!  I'll bet no one would leave the theatre until Jesse and  Jenny and the kids were safe and sound!<br />I'm a Stuart Woods fan, but had  missed this one.  I'm sleepy at work today, but it was well worth it.  Enjoy!	1999-11-24

I've read all of Hillerman's series showcasing Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee.  I've not been disappointed in any of the stories, including the latest.<br />Hillerman's characters are now so familiar to me that I fall  right into their 'Navajo Time' rhythm and feel at home in their part of the  world.<br />To me, the plots/crimes are almost secondary to learning about  the wise Leaphorn and the hungry for knowledge Chee.<br />I'll continue to  read Hillerman for as long as he writes.  With characters like these, he  will never run out of good plot lines.<br />P.S.  I like the new love  interest in Chee's life.  Janet Peete was never right for him....<br />Enjoy!	1999-11-17

Judith Krantz has turned into a formula writer with only one story to tell: that of a beautiful, yet somehow tragic heroine, who must overcome some kind of adversity to reach the top; marry one of the world's richest,  most powerful men; go through another tragedy; and end her life surrounded  by friends and family (and most usually, a second husband).<br /> This is  just too much of a good thing over and over and over again.  I know Krantz  is no Faulkner, but I've grown a bit tired of the same ole' story, no  matter how the scenery changes.<br />Either quit or find a new framework for  your stories!

She's quirky, intensely loyal and tenancious as a bulldog. Additionally, anyone who is brave enough to cut their hair with cuticle scissors is to be admired.  I  have every volume and I've enjoyed reading all of her adventures.<br />I  especially liked this book because we get a glimpse into Kinsey's past and  begin to see why she acts/reacts to men and to tight situations the way she  does.<br />I read this book in two sittings and would recommend it to any  other Grafton fans.<br />To a new reader, however, I would recommend that  the stories be read in order.  Grafton builds something new into each one  and, as they build, the reader begins to understand Kinsey and her slightly  off-centered world.<br />P.S.  Ms. Grafton -- we need more of Henry....he's  just too precious for words -- and because of his age, he might not be  around/spry for the rest of the alphabet.	1999-10-18

Her strange array of friends were delightful.<br />The only thing that struck  me odd was how long it took Novalee to find true love.

I haven't read anything by McMurtry...I tried to get past page 50 of &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; a dozen times,without success.  However, the jacket notes of this book intrigued me and I jumped in.  I'm glad I did,  too!<br />This is a book for anyone who has thought about the meaning of life;  who has been depressed; who has lived with someone with depression; who has  made it to 50; who has lost someone they love; who has not quite lived up  to their teen-age reputations.  In other words, this is a book that anyone  over 40 can relate to...you don't have to be male to understand Duane's  desperation or despondency.<br />I gave this book to my spouse to  read...hope he finds as much enjoyment and enlightenment as I did.<br />A  great read and well worth my precious spare time.	1999-02-27

Don't be fooled into thinking that just because the author has had some hits in the past that this tripe is worth your money OR your time!<br />There were many offensive  aspects to this book.  However, the last line about the &quot;hero&quot;  leaving the door open for a possible affair with one of the really  beautiful (a/k/a rich) people in his circle of suspects really left a  horrible taste in my mouth.  The hero allowed for the possibility of an  affair with this shallow, WASPY woman while his wife was carrying their  second child!  What a JERK!<br />Don't waste your time!	1999-02-22

That should have been my first clue that something was amiss.<br />I will admit I enjoyed the insider's look at Hollywood's  fascination with Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman's murders. Other than that  information, the rest of the story left me cold; especially the ending with  Andrew Cunannan.  Quite a stretch, if you ask me.<br />Don't waste your time  with this drivel unless, like Gus Bailey and Dominick Dunne, you just can't  get enough of the OJ debacle.	1999-02-01

The REAL story here was Evan's return to the world after 25 years on ice!<br />I like this hero and am anxious to read more  about him.

I started with &quot;Catering to  Nobody,&quot; and have all the others (save the latest--&quot;The Grilling  Season&quot;), but I don't think I'm going to be able to finish them.<br />Ms. Mott-Davidson's storytelling talents began to fade with &quot;Dying  for Chocolate,&quot; paled some more in the overwrought &quot;The Cereal  Killers,&quot; and then went out altogether on &quot;The Last  Suppers,&quot; which I didn't finish.<br />At least Grafton and Evanovich's  mysteries kept things lively.  In each volume, Ms. Mott-Davidson's body  count rose to an incredible level and left me with serious doubts about  wanting to befriend Goldy and her clan.<br />I'm disappointed and will no  recommend this series to my readers, no matter the wonderful recipes.

My review of &quot;the genesis  code&quot; sparked debate in my small hometown and I eageraly awaited  case's next tale.<br />This book should scare the beejeezus out of all of us.  Case's story of biological warfare was much more plausible than, say,  &quot;The Cobra Event,&quot; which I enjoyed, but it didn't really make me  sit up and take notice because it's demented villan operated alone. The bad  guy in &quot;the first horseman&quot; has an army of devoted followers and  a seemingly endless treasury that will allow him to set &quot;The Spanish  Lady&quot; (a particulary virulent strain of influenza) out into the  world.<br />I'm glad to be living in a small town with no strategic importance  in the scheme of world politics.

I love their native  blood, their corner of the world, their integrity, their skills as lawmen.  I eagerly await each new Hillerman book and was on the list at amazon.com  for weeks for his latest story.<br />With that said, I must admit that this  was the first time since &quot;Finding Moon&quot; that I did not finish a  Hillerman/Chee/Leaphorn story in one sitting.  In fact, it took me almost a  week to slog through to the conclusion.<br />The story had little, if any,  cohesivenss -- I had to re-read parts to keep all the characters straight.  I found several of the plot devices trite and so beneath the  characters.<br />I did like Joe Leaphorn's new love interest and look forward  to more stories with the two of them joining forces to solve crimes.<br />I  was also very touched by the scene between Jim Chee and his beloved  granduncle.  I wept at the end of that chapter.  Hillerman's talents were  at full tilt during this scene and I wished for more of the same...it just  wasn't to be found in this book.<br />&quot;First Eagle&quot; is not a true  representation of Hillerman's abilities.  If you're a first time reader,  try ANY of the earlier stories.  To me, they're heads above this latest  effort.<br />Terry Mathews	1998-08-23

In New Orleans, they sit side by side at the Acme Oyster Bar.<br />Besides missing New Orleans' character all together, Brown's story really isn't too tightly woven.  I didn't really feel sorry for Pinky's trapped wife and I really didn't much like the crusading cop.<br />To me, this book just flat misses the mark.	1998-06-05

The lady cop understands the nature of his work and she doesn't take anything from him that she doesn't give right back, in spades.  There's more fire and vinegar in this relationship and I thought it really rang true.<br />&quot;Secret Prey&quot; is a great summer book.....	1998-06-02
