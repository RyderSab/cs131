In this tedious and boring volume, all Bellant can prove is that the Coors family writes checks for Republicans. Is this a sin against democracy? Hardly. We only have two parties, and if the Coors feel more inclined toward the Republicans, they have every right to act on those convictions. Bellant has no evidence that the Coors are connected to any actual subversive or law-breaking organization like the Christian Identity movement or Aryan Nations. The &quot;right-wing&quot; groups that Bellant identifies are simply ordinary Republicans. In some cases, Coors donates to groups that oppose legalized abortion or the advocacy of homosexuality in the school system - but are these groups really &quot;anti-democratic&quot; or &quot;anti-pluralism?&quot; If People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has the right to campaign against the eating of meat, then I think James Dobson has the right to campaign against abortion. Or did I miss something in civics class? Bellant has every right to say that people like James Dobson are wrong, but he has no right to imply that they are violent subversives who operate outside the law simply because their views don't square with those of the Democratic party.<br />Bellant has an obvious axe to grind with evangelical Christians, whom he characterizes as demonic minions who must be cleansed from the American landscape simply because their views aren't like his.	2001-12-27

In the view of many liberals, a Protestant Taliban has emerged in the nation's heartland, with the goal of taking over the United States and wiping out all the &quot;progress&quot; society has made since the 1920s. Mainstream religious organizations - such as the Baptist Church, the world's largest non-catholic Christian communion - are really only fronts for this insidious, anti-modern movement. For reasons that are never explained, Roman Catholics, Muslims, and others whose social beliefs are far more conservative and politically-inclined than evangelical Protestants are never similarly excoriated or held as objects of terror by the liberal elite. This lapse is especially striking when one considers that Islam exists with the express purpose of becoming one with the State, and that Catholic social thought (which is the guiding ideology of JP2) is based on the idea of one national church, and that Catholic bishops routinely tell the laity how to vote not just on a few issues, but on virtually every issue facing voters. For some vague reason, it is Evangelicals - people like Baptists, who oppose state-established religion and government compulsion in spiritual affairs - who are the subversives we must fear and restrain.<br />While a number of religious personalities (Tim LaHaye, James Dobson, Jerry Falwell, etc.) have espoused views that congeal with the agenda of the Republican Party, none of these individuals have ever &quot;crossed the line&quot; into subversive or illegal activity. They have simply expressed their views; until the First Amendment is withdrawn, they have every right to do so.<br />The few genuine &quot;Christian Right&quot; movements - Christian Reconstructionism, for example - are smaller and less influential than PETA, let alone established, effective public policy groups like the Cato Institute or NOW. <br />Why do people likeSara Diamond insist on portraying Evangelical Christians are demons? The truth is Evangelicals are fairly moderate compared to other religions - they permit divorce; they permit non-reproductive sex within marriage; many of them embrace the ordination of women in the church and complete equality of women in the social sphere. Their churches are generally democratic, with all members having an equal say in the spiritual and economic administration of the church. They believe in purely voluntary religion - no forced conversions or forced retention of members.<br />America, you have nothing to fear from Baptists or Pentecostals. You have more to fear from misguided, misinformed people like Sara Diamond, who'll set you against your neighbor and close down the possibility of real dialogue about the issues facing our society.	2001-12-21

Revised & Expanded Edition	Books	1	16	58	N	N	Based on Seventh-Day Adventist theology	Ken Ham and his cohorts at Answers in Genesis have made some positive contributions by questioning how an unguided process of evolution could have produced all life on earth. We should be thankful that Ham and AIG keep debate about Darwinism alive and simmering.<br />That said, Ham has done more than good by promoting Seventh-Day Adventist theology under the guise of &quot;creation science&quot; to unsuspecting Fundamentalists (with a few evangelicals and Catholics taken along for the ride, to boot). The fact is that a literal reading of Genesis, where &quot;Day&quot; must mean 24-hours, is not orthodox Christian theology. It comes from the Seventh-Day Adventists - a group that insists on Saturday worship, vegetarian diets, and the belief that the End Times began in 1844 when Jesus &quot;entered the sanctuary&quot; in Heaven. <br />The Bible is God's word to man. God spoke to man in the terms man understood. If you take the Bible too literally, then you have to admit that the sky is hard and possibly metallic (Genesis calls the sky a &quot;dome&quot; in the ESV and a &quot;firmament&quot; in the KJV, while a character in Job asks Job if he can spread out the skies &quot;as hard as a sheet of burnished bronze). The earth is flat because it is &quot;spread out&quot; and has &quot;four corners.&quot; The earth rests on &quot;pillars.&quot; Rain comes through &quot;Windows&quot; in the sky. Outer space is made up &quot;Water&quot; rather than emptiness. <br />As we can see, the Bible speaks of the natural world in terms understood by ancient Hebrews. The Bible is not concerned with science - it's concerned with faith and morals. If you don't acknowledge this fact and insist that every word in the Bible is literally true, then you have to explain why the sky is hard, the earth flat, and why outer space is made up of water.	2001-12-11

Men should be devoted to the welfare of their wives. They should be spiritual leaders in the home. Women should honor their husband's attempts to provide for them.<br />That said, Piper misses the mark. He teaches that God designed creation so that Man was the ultimate authority, and that woman's created duty is merely to obey. As much as Piper tries to nuance this view with talk of husbands being &quot;loving,&quot; the end result is that the husband still has the final say and the right to break his wife's will if they reach loggerheads. <br />The correct Biblical view is this: women are in an inferior position to men because our Fall from the Garden has cursed the world. The initial harmony between men and women has been ruined. Genesis teaches that there was no formal &quot;hierarchy&quot; between men and women before the Fall - all of the &quot;complementarians&quot; ingenius attempts to smuggle a master/servent dynamic into the pre-Fall relationship have fallen flat because their assumptions simply aren't apparent in the text. Therefore, man's rule over woman is part of a broken, cursed existence, just like the fact that there are masters and slaves. A Christian man is not to embrace and rejoice in his role as &quot;leader.&quot; His job is to raise his wife up to a level of equal worth and personhood to himself, despite his culture's insistence that women are just jiggly sex toys. The complementarian model is flawed because it teaches men to relish their role as &quot;head,&quot; and sees the main problem with gender relationships being women getting out of line.	2001-12-06

He thinks that he has been called by God to save Fundamentalists from such heresies as these:<br />- that we should communicate the gospel to people using language they understand<br />- that we shouldn't put barriers in the way of people accepting Christ just to suit our own tastes<br />- that we should care for the poor, help the sick, defend the unborn, and reach out to &quot;the least of these&quot;<br />Unlike other crackpots like Peter Ruckman, David Cloud isn't funny or entertaining in his own paranoid way. He's just bitter; all of his writings convey a mood of intense personal desperation over the fact that no one else agrees with him and that his sect of &quot;independent fundamentalists&quot; are declining while other branches of the evangelical Church, which Cloud deems &quot;heretical&quot; because they use a modern Bible or because they actually evangelize, go from strength to strength.<br />In this volume, Cloud recycles the anti-Bible rhetoric of more prominent KJV-Fundamentalists to accuse modern Bible translators of being &quot;liberals&quot; in league with the Vatican to wipe out the Fundamentalists.<br />Cloud's accusations against modern Bibles are wrong. First of all, modern Bibles do not delete the deity of Christ or the Trinity. All in all, they teach these doctrines more often than the KJV does. The KJV, for example, deletes Christ's deity from John 1:18, Colossians 1:19, Titus 2:13, Acts 3:15, and many other verses. It deletes the Trinity from Acts 16:7. These doctrines are present in the NIV, ESV, and other modern translations, but because of bumbling on the part of the KJV translators, they're not in the KJV. So Cloud's charge that the NIV tries to delete the deity of Christ simply doesn't stand up. Most of the modern versions, except for the seldom-used Good News and NRSV Bibles, were produced by men who explicitly affirmed the inerrancy of Scripture - Cloud lies when he says that modern Bible translators are liberals. (BTW, lying is a sin.)<br />Second, Cloud's own stance is inconsistent. Cloud advocates a type of separation in which &quot;independent fundamental&quot; baptists should have NO contact or dealing whatsoever with any other religious group. He singles out &quot;new evangelicals&quot; for particular scorn. But the KJV was translated by Anglicans who were largely Popish in their theology, and it was based on the Textus Receptus, which was edited by a Catholic priest. Cloud reveals himself to be a Fool when he tells Fundamentalists that they can't associate with Evangelicals, whom they disagree with mostly on matters of musical style and their approach to presenting the Gospel in culturally-relevant terms, but then tells them to trust a Bible that was produced largely by individuals who didn't even agree with Baptists about what the Gospel IS.<br />In the end, there is nothing of value to be found within Cloud's rhetoric. It's entirely empty of truth and substance.nslators are liberals. (BTW, lying is a sin.)<br />Second, Cloud's own stance is inconsistent.

She mistakes the world's fallen ideals of male/female relationships - in which men are dominant and women are gleefully subservient - to be God's plan for humankind. The best a girl can do is submit to this \\"divine plan\\" and go through live as a floppy, passive puppet. (Amazingly, Elliot bases most of her argument on her experiences with a stone age tribe in which the men spent most of their time goofing off and women quietly toiled in the shadows. She honestly upholds the lazy, self-centered machismo of primitive savages as ideal masculinity.)<br />Elliot is wrong. (...) God didn't honor and reward passive, floppy females - he honored and exalted women who took a stand on His side (Deborah, Anna, Mary). God doesn't tell Christian men to lord their authority over their wives - he tells them to love and honor their wives as their own bodies. (...) I mourn that many godly women have been hurt, emotionally and sometimes physically, by Elliot's mis-informed teachings. (BTW, why is Elliot writing books if women aren't supposed to teach? She contributes to publications for the Council for Biblical Man and Womanhood, another mis-informed organization, so she's plainly teaching men as well as women. Elliot's own ministry stands in contradiction to her doctrine!)

No one can hope to understand the Southern Baptist Convention's recent statements about women without digging into the theological issues presented in this book.<br />This book is widely influential, and I doubt that the Southern Baptists' conservative faction had enough brain power between them to produce the SBC's 1997 statement on the family without the Council for Biblical Man and Womanhood providing the rhetoric needed to support the position.<br />Unfortunately, this book's point of view is wrong. The authors spend little time dwelling on how the Fall has affected creation, because they are determined to say that Male Dominance is part of God's plan for creation, not part of a sinful world. To these authors, the real threat to women - most of whom live in a world where they are vastly inferior in social position to men - isn't militant men like the Taliban, but feminists who blur gender distinctions. The authors echo the Fundamentalist misunderstanding that the West was &quot;God's culture&quot; until this century, and that the slide into Liberalism ruined a godly nation. They employ a highly-suspect &quot;historical-critical&quot; interpretation of Genesis 3:16 to subvert the obvious Biblical teaching that man and woman were equal before the Fall and that men now rule as a result of Sin's entrance into our world.<br />The truth is that all of human history has been one stain from Sin. The real threat to the vast majority of women isn't gender confusion - it's brutalization from men. God's Word teaches that this was not His plan for Adam and Eve. Too bad that the Southern Baptists - the same folks who fought to justify Slavery against the Biblical arguments of northern Baptist abolitionists - feel the need to resurrect the same arguments in favor of another Sinful institution and cause schism and division in the Church as a result.	2001-12-03

Like Peter Ruckman and others, he believes that the King James translation was inspired by God to supersede the original Bible writings. When Cloud says &quot;Bible,&quot; he means the King James, and the assorted distorted doctrines that &quot;independent fundamentalists&quot; are able to twist from the KJV thanks to its archaic language.<br />Secondly, Cloud's main claim to fame is his constant and relentless attacks on Christian leaders and institutions. Cloud has literally attacked every Christian leader who has ever done anything great for God as a &quot;neoevangelical apostate,&quot; &quot;liberal,&quot; whose goal is to trick evangelicals into joining the Catholic Church and accepting the Mark of the Beast. Even rock-ribbed Fundamentalists like Bob Jones III fall under Cloud's condemnation. Cloud says that the Christian church is really a heretical movement started by Swedish intellectuals and that only the few rag-tag &quot;independent fundamentalist&quot; King James readers out there are God's real people.<br />Third, Cloud's personal theology is intensely aberrant. Like other King James Onlyists, he denies basic Trinitarian and Christological teachings (e.g., they maintain Christ was begotten only in his human nature), but he also denies basic elements of Christian morality. According to Cloud, ministries to the sick, the poor, the unborn, and others who desperately need our help is &quot;unbiblical...a social gospel,&quot; and the first step toward liberalism. I think Jesus is going to tell Cloud &quot;depart from me...I never knew you.&quot;<br />Is this the man you want to teach you about &quot;Bible difficulties?&quot; I don't think so.

White, a Reformed Baptist elder and anti-cult researcher, wrote a powerful and convincing book against the King James Only position. He pointed out that the King James Bible is based on only a few manuscripts, and that many of these manuscripts were flawed. In fact, the KJV often deletes Christ's deity in places where it belongs (e.g., John 1:8, Colossians 1:19); the NIV teaches that Christ is God MORE OFTEN than the KJV.<br />So how does Cloud - the pastor of a little &quot;independent baptist&quot; bible chapel - respond to this? He doesn't. He simply says that White is arrogant and makes some Ruckmanish noise about God &quot;preserving&quot; the KJV.<br />I've personally debated David W. Cloud via e-mail. Cloud is a wrathful, egotistical, self-deluded man who is incapable of addressing and responding to real challenges and information. I will repeat my challenge to David W. Cloud here:<br />MR.

The charge is preposterous. Throughout Latin America and Europe, evangelicals are winning those who failed to find Christ within Rome. The Pope is so worried that he has set up commissions to stop Evangelicals in Latin America, Estonia, and other nations. Does this sound like cooperation to you?<br />According David W. Cloud, Bible-believing Christians are evil. Everyone who wants to serve God must leave Christianity and embrace Cloud's King James Only cult (this cult group, by the way, denies orthodox Christian teaching on the nature of Christ and the Trinity, and teaches that God added new revelation to the Bible in 1611 A.D.) <br />David W. Cloud is a twisted, sick individual. His writings have contributed nothing to the advancement of the Gospel. In fact, one would be hard pressed to find David Cloud saying ANYTHING that is in itself constructive or affirming - all he does is distort the records of reputable Christian leaders, slandering men of God.  The only people who read Cloud are radical King James-Only Fundamentalists who are bitter that Bible-believing Christians rejected their heretical teachings. I've looked over most of what Cloud has on his website for kicks, and Cloud NEVER presents the Gospel, NEVER quotes Scripture in its proper context, and NEVER talks about Jesus. Cloud says that helping the poor is wrong, because this is \\"social gospel.\\" Cloud DOES do the following: negate the clear teachings of the New Testament with distorted quotes from the Old - call medieval Papists who edited the Textus Receptus \\"good Christian men\\" while condemning modern Evangelicals for sins such as watching TV - endorse violent Northern Irish extremists - the list goes on. When facts fail David Cloud (as they usually do), he simply makes stuff up (the supposed Unitarian Universalist endorsement of the NIV is sheer fantasy). Fortunately, Cloud is such an atrocious writer with such a poor grasp of web design that nobody stays on his site for long.<br />Cloud is in good company - other King James Only cultists (like Gail Riplinger) say that we must work for our salvation, that demons have sex with us, that the government is taking samples of DNA to clone us after the Rapture, etc.<br />It IS true that Evangelicals recognize that some Catholics may be saved, thanks to the grace of God and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Luther thought this, too. So did Calvin, Smyth&Helwys, and every other Protestant reformer you can name. But does the fact that Promise Keepers admits that some Catholics may go to Heaven, and that some Evangelicals cooperate in political matters with some Catholics (of course, politics is something quite outside religion) mean that the National Association of Evangelicals is about to accept the authority of the Pope? Of course not!	2001-11-28

Gould - think that sociobiology is junk science. Sociobiologists justify any human behavior, including rape, as part of &quot;evolutionary heritage.&quot; Why do we think fat women are ugly? Well, it's in the genes. Why do men like war  movies? It's in the genes again. Sociobiologists can spin a tale to account for any human action through &quot;evolution.&quot; But sociobiology hasn't been that well received inside or outside the scientific community. There is no evidence of a &quot;belief gene,&quot; and even if a &quot;belief gene&quot; were to be spotted tomorrow, the fact that the gene exists implies that &quot;beliefs&quot; give humans an advantage in natural selection. If believing in fairies makes people better adapted to their environment, why should we change it?<br />Furthermore, the reputation of SCIENCE as a beacon has been severely tarnished by a little event we call the TWENTIETH CENTURY. By the late 19th century, people thought that SCIENCE would bring us into a golden age. By 2001, we were all supposed to be a bunch of happy, space-aged atheists living in a world free of disease, war, poverty, and the base human urges. Instead, we got two world wars, genocides, a Cold War, and the atom bomb. No doubt that science has enhanced our lives tremendously through medicine and fiberoptic networks that let us download porno 24/7. But the idea that SCIENCE and ATHEISM will lead us to a golden age is shot. Secular Humanists may complain that the rest of us suffer from a &quot;belief gene&quot; that makes us too primitive to see the TRUTH of their ideas, but the more likely explanation is that atheists were the main architects of the 20th century's biggest disasters (Marxism, Nazism, and western societies' own disasterous attempts at social engineering). <br />Which brings me to my next point: Park complains about people &quot;believing&quot; things, but he seems to believe a lot. Secular Humanism is a rigid, fundamentalistic belief system, complete with a religious vision of man's place in the universe and his ultimate destiny. If he turned his skepticism on his own beliefs, I'd respect him more.<br />Finally, science itself hasn't proven to be the great beacon of materialistic enlightenment. I know well-trained physicists who talk about new dimensions bursting into our own thanks to &quot;string theory.&quot; They believe in parallel dimensions. They believe that linear time is an illusion. Biologists believe in space aliens. The man who discovered DNA - Francis Crick - thinks that life on earth was put here by space men, who might be energy-based life forms and therefore immortal. The great Secular Humanist passion play of our times - Star Trek - abounds with creatures from the &quot;Q&quot; continuum, telepaths, energy-based life, portals to other dimensions, etc. All of it is undergirded bytheoretical science. (Park complains how some of this science is distorted by charlatans like Deepak Chopra, who claim you can remain ageless via quantum physics, but everything that I've described comes straight out of mainstream science.) The distinction between these ideas and &quot;supernaturalism&quot; seem to be semantic. When a scientist of Crick's caliber feels the need to invoke invisible space creatures, one wonders....<br />Also, who says that scientists have any great insights into human nature or how the world works? Scientists today are highly specialized. Outside their fields, they don't know anything more than the rest of us. I'm all for rationality and a scientific view of the world, but let's not put scientists up on some pedestal as the definitive interpreters of all reality.	2001-10-22

The best support a book can receive is negative reviews by individuals who completely misunderstand the book's content. Darwin On Trial is almost in a class by itself on this score.<br />Contrary to what many have said, Darwin on Trial is not an &quot;Anti-evolution&quot; book. On the contrary, it openly acknowledges that evolution may be the creative mechanism of &quot;the designer.&quot; What the book really argues can be summarized as follows:<br />1. Evolutionary biology is largely theory without real facts to support it. The sweeping vistas of life's evolution from prebiotic soup to man spring from the imagination of creative writers, not empirical observation.<br />2. Darwin's theory of natural selection is largely vacuous because it doesn't explain the development of life. (Merely stating that the survivors survived doesn't tell us much about how these survivors first came to exist.)<br />3. Life is too complex to have arisen by chance.<br />There really is little here that is controversial. While Johnson is a lawyer and this book is aimed at popular audiences, it was reviewed by scientific consultants for accuracy and is published by IVP, a respected publisher, not the Institute for Creation Research or some other crackpot organization.<br />The reviewers who attempt to smear this book as creationist clap-trap typically misunderstand it. Here are the common misperceptions:<br />1. Johnson says evolution didn't take place. Wrong. His argument is with blind evolution via natural selection.<br />2. Johnson is evil. God sucks. Kill all the Christians. No rebuttal needed. (And incidentally, these reviews come pretty close to proving Johnson's remarks about Darwinist religion.)<br />Darwin on Trial is a good book to start reading on the design controversy. Those with a more scientific bent can graduate to books by Behe, Debeski, Denton, Plantinga, and others.<br />Make no mistake. THERE IS NO GENUINE INTELLECTUAL REBUTTAL TO INTELLIGENT DESIGN. I have been searching literature for nearly two years, and there isn't any criticism of intelligent design that stands up to scrutiny. Some have offered the &quot;Evolution&quot; of human languages as an example of how evolution occurs, but this notion is plainly idiotic (languages evolve through human interaction, not natural selection). But most simply attack ID as evil, act insanely confident in Darwinism without bothering to offer evidence for their position, and lump ID in with young earth creationism. <br />Unfortunately, Darwinians have read their Kuhn, too, and are determined to defeat the paradigm shift through Nazi-esque political manuevers. But in the end, it won't work.	2001-10-19

This is just another book that attempts to enthrone Charles Darwin as the definitive prophet of science by debunking young earth creationists. The book debunks people who think the earth is 6,000 years old, and uses this as \\"proof\\" of Darwinian evolution.<br />There is no doubt that creation scientists are wrong. But does that make Darwin right? Hardly.<br />The chapter on the intelligent design movement is weak. The author can do little better than try to lump intelligent design theorists with young earth creationists and tries to prove Darwinism by pointing to the way automobiles have changed over the years.<br />This book sucks. Even the Darwinist devotees give it less than five stars - which says something, since Darwinists typically give ANY anti-creationist book five stars regardless of its merit.	2001-10-19

A number of contributors rightly point out that even if contemporary Darwinian theory is correct, it doesn't imply atheism, since the idea of &quot;divinely-planned&quot; evolution is simply outside of science's domain. That tact likely explains the absence of Richard Dawkins from this collection, since Dawkins is a Fundamentalist Atheist who bases on a career out of blending science's rules to propagate his own militant religious beliefs.<br />However, this book has a number of flaws that lay readers should consider before accepting it wholesale:<br />1. The evolutionary data is purely orthodox neo-Darwinism. There is no real question about natural selection's ability to create complex life forms, other than a nod to Stephen J. Gould's &quot;punctuated equilibrium&quot; theory. But a growing number of qualified, credentialed scientists are questioning neo-Darwinism, and not all of them are theists. Many are proposing &quot;complexity theory&quot; as an alternative. The editors should have acknowledged that the theory is in a state of transition. A number of statements made in the book - e.g., the universality of the genetic code - have been proven false in recent research.<br />2. The section on intelligent design gave two ID proponents (William Dembeski and Michael Behe) a chance to speak for themselves instead of being interpreted by hysterical neo-Darwinists. This is good. But the format gives the ID proponents an article followed by a Darwinist rebuttal, without giving the ID proponents a chance to rebut the rebuttal. The articles on the &quot;design inference&quot; of William Dembeski is too far above the non-mathematician's head to be comprehensible by either side. But the exchange between Michael Behe and Brown University biologist Kenneth Miller was more accessible. Miller's rebuttal should not have been allowed to stand, because his arguments (thecondition of the genetic code, and &quot;imperfections&quot; in living organisms) have been conclusively debunked in numerous forums. Miller doesn't seem to understand the Intelligent Design position; he seems to confuse it with instantaneous creation, when actually Intelligent Design stands much closer to theistic evolution. Giving Miller the final word on the subject isn't wise, since Miller's analysis falls short and his arguments are known to be flawed.	2001-10-19

This branch of science was universally recognized as valid and legitimate until orthodox Darwinists realized that its conclusions effectively negated the theory that biological evolution happens purely by chance. (Mathematics has been a thorn in Darwinism's side for decades.)<br />So how does Pennock refute this &quot;new creationism?&quot; First, he spends most of his book refuting the Old Creationism, i.e., Young-Earthers. It's pretty easy to show that the earth is old, and for the most part, this is taken as de facto proof that life is the product of mindless natural selection.<br />Then he makes the most startingly intellectual failure I have ever seen: he says that language &quot;evolved,&quot; and this evolution proves by analogy that life evolved without conscious direction or planning.<br />I have a background in linguistics. The first thing that any linguist learns is that language changes through the principle of common usage. In short, languages change because people change them. People qualify as intelligent agents - even people like Pennock. In fact, outside of the minds of intelligent agents, language does not even exist. That's why languages die with their last speakers. Moreover, there is absolutely no &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; or &quot;natural selection&quot; mechanism in linguistics. It's all simply common usage. For example, the rampant use of the word &quot;like&quot; is hardly an evolutionary advancement. It degrades language; the usage of &quot;like&quot; isn't survival of the fittest in any sense.<br />Intelligent design is an important contribution to science with deep roots in information and complexity theories. As the science advances, it will have an important role in biotechnology, encryption, genetics, and other fields - even linguistics, since we're increasingly moving into an age of &quot;designer language.&quot;<br />To condemn and kill a branch of science because it doesn't fit with one's speculation about how life evolved is pure dogmatism, period. The Big Bang also tends to weigh in on the side of theism rather than atheism, but the Big Bang is a fruitful model of science that has served us well. (And the atheists have been able to sleep better at night by supposing, without a shred of evidence, that we're a &quot;bubble universe&quot; and that there are all kinds of &quot;parallel universes&quot; without life, so we can continue to suppose that there is no God to whom we owe anything.)  In the same way, atheists can accept Intelligent Design theory with other creative evasions - e.g., life on earth was designed by aliens, life &quot;designs itself&quot; on a cellular level, information from the future comes back to the past and shapes life, etc.<br />Pennock's book - and its positive reviewers - are just another example of adherents of an old paradigm fighting to preserve their theory, their religion (Evolutionary Humanism), and their funding.ancement.

I appreciate Ruse's attempts to find common ground between religion and science, and I agree with him that evolution (of a type) more than likely is God's creating mechanism.<br />I don't think Darwin gave a very good description of how evolution works (the evidence is plainly piling up against the idea that random mutation and natural selection are the main drivers of evolution), and I give this book a poor rating for blithely assuming that Darwin's highly theoretical (and no crumbling) theory is fact.	2001-10-18

While Darwinian evolution was never accepted by the great masses of America (about 45% of people believe in Creation Science, and another 45% believe in intelligent design or &quot;divinely-guided&quot; evolution), Western society's elite has literally worshiped Darwin's thesis that order emerges from disorder without any intelligent agent guiding the process. This elite has been the movers and shakers of the 20th century. It's fair to say that Marxism, Nazism, totalitarianism, heartless Capitalism, nihilism, existentialism, and a host of other philosophies that have brought 20th century man to the brink of annihilation on both societal and personal levels find their roots in this modest book.<br />But is Darwin's thesis true? The truth is that Darwinism explains nothing. The idea that variation plus natural selection accounts for life is nothing more than a tautology: of course the variants that were most fit for survival survived! That's simply saying the same thing twice. It doesn't account for how life arrived in the first place, and does account for why the &quot;variations&quot; showed up on time. The fossil record has been disasterous to Darwinism, showing that species appear suddenly without precursors, and vary very little within the duration of the species. (A theory called &quot;punk eek&quot; has been proposed to explain why this is, but it's totally unfalsifiable and therefore worthless.) More damaging has been studies in the field of mathematics, physics, and biochemistry, which show that the universe has not existed long enough for such evolution to take place, and that life is far more complicated on a molecular level than Darwin thought.<br />So why does Darwinism endure? Why does anyone who questions Darwinism find himself out of a job?<br />Two reasons. First, 20th century science has rigged the rules to say &quot;a theory is always accepted, no matter what the evidence against it,as long as there is no other theory.&quot; In other words, if Darwinism can be bent to explain 25% of the evidence and no other theory exists to explain more, then Darwinism is accepted as fact. Second, Darwinism is the key component to most modern philosophy. It tells us who we are, where we're going, what we're capable of as a species. There has never, ever been a culture that doesn't have a &quot;creation myth&quot; that explains who humans beings are what the proper way to live is. Imagine for a moment a culture that truly has no idea what it means to be human...how long could such a culture endure? How long could people convince themselves of the rightness of their economic policies, social institutions, and pecking orders? If we admit that Darwinism is wrong but don't put anything in its place, society will intellectually collapse.<br />That, rather than sound science, explains Darwin's duration, despite the sick, groteque legacy he has left mankind.	2001-10-15

This life develops, apparently, more or less on its own, because according to Miller, life shows no apparent intelligent design. Miller's God (and this is Darwin's God, it seems) is like a brewer of fermented beverages, who stuffs ingredients into a flask and comes back in several years to see what's brewing.<br />As a Christian, I don't find Miller's God to be remotely like the one presented in the Bible. I don't see why Miller needs to restrict God to some remote &quot;first cause&quot; when Yahweh and Jesus are always messing with the laws of nature in the Bible. Miller is welcome to believe in his Deist god, but he goes too far in trying to brush over the conflict between Darwinism and religion. The conflict is real, and clever rhetoric isn't enough to whitewash it away.<br />Some scientists have proposed an idea called &quot;intelligent design,&quot; in which they say that life was designed by an guiding force (not excluding God). This hypothesis has been met by a ferocious response in which scientists have lost their jobs, their teaching tenure, been slandered in the press, and in some cases have even been arrested for not teaching orthodox neo-Darwinian theory. To date, no one has offered a compelling critique of Intelligent Design.<br />Miller's critique of Intelligent Design is widely touted as the definitive rebuttal of the movement, but when you read Miller's arguments against ID, you realize that Miller doesn't understand what the movement is about.<br />ID is not against evolution. Most ID proponents readily admit that common descent is a fact - they simply deny that pure chance processes could have driven evolution. <br />Miller marshals misleading arguments against ID (for example, the long-debunked &quot;argument from imperfection) and implies that ID is &quot;stealth creationism.&quot; Noone has ever found an &quot;evolutionary link&quot; between creationists like Ken Hamm and ID proponents; they're different movements with different aims. ID isn't even distinctly Christian. <br />ID offers a more compelling vision of nature than Miller's. There is much in ID that needs to be refined, but unless the movement is crushed by political force (which, unfortunately, is likely), I think ID will flower into something much greater than Miller's half-baked theorizing.	2001-10-12

Three interrelated faiths - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all deny each other's central doctrines. When we move out from the West, we see such diversity of religious beliefs that no common theme emerges.<br />Religious experience ranges from animism (where you can be healed of your ailments by absorbing the soul of a bird) to certain types of Buddhism that don't even believe in a god. The idea of a common &quot;religion&quot; is simply false - especially when you realize that Atheistic philosophies like Communism and Nazism are fully-functional religions in their own right. <br />Shermer's warmed-over Jungian approach is 100 years out of date.	2001-10-11

It is obvious that neither reviewer has read this book, in part or in total. <br />Intelligent Design is not creation science. It accepts evolution (i.e., common descent), gradual change over time, and natural selection as a fine-tuning mechanicism of life. It merely suggests that the formation of life is guided by intelligence - the exact question of how that intelligence performed its work, or who that intelligence is, is left open. (It could be anything from aliens to Zeus.) <br />Intelligent Design has caused Darwinian Fundamentalists to react with alarm because Darwinism is the central facet of their world view. Their objections are more philosophical than scientific (I've yet to read ONE negative review of an ID book that contains any science whatsoever). Darwinists have been the Grand Inquisitors of academia and are crushing real science. While Physics, Astronomy, Genetics, and other fields are literally taking quantum leaps into the future, evolutionary Biology has barely advanced past the early 1900s thanks to the the Fundamentalists' insistence that all evidence be construed, however obliquely, to support the notion that natural selection and random mutation can account for all life on earth. <br />Read about ID and make up your mind.

Anyone who calls a qualified, honest scientist who proposes an alternative idea to natural selection a &quot;creationist&quot; should be castigated by the scientific community and have his book deal immediately revoked.<br />Unfortunately, that is precisely what this book does. This book claims to &quot;prove&quot; evolution, but all it does is review evidence that the earth is old. This may very well disprove the Ken Hamms of the world (and the sooner Creationists go away the better, as far as I'm concerned), but it does nothing to prove Darwinism. Evidence is mounting from biochemistry, information theory, physics, mathematics, anthropology and other disciplines that casts serious doubts on the theory that natural selection and random variation was the main driver behind life on earth; it appears now that Darwinism only accounts for relatively small variations in pre-existing organisms. Darwinists have had to retreat to a theory of &quot;punctuated equilibrium,&quot; which in essence says &quot;we can't find any evidence whatsoever for natural selection as the main switch, but we're sure it happened.&quot; Darwin in the gaps - how ironic.<br />This book doesn't even deal with these questions. All it does is attempt to drive home the lie that all people who question the scientific orthodoxy of Darwinism are Creationists who must be silenced.<br />The only &quot;triumph&quot; of this book is that it proves, again, that Darwinists are hapless to refute Intelligent Design.	2001-10-05

It is manifestly obvious that biochemistry has a great deal to say about evolution. Barring a field from the debate simply because it doesn't yield the desired answers smacks of politics, not science.<br /> Is that serious intellectual inquiry? Or is it Darwinian Fundamentalism?

The story line is one of the most intelligent plots I've read in a long time, and the characters are as likely to talk about Nietzche and modern philosophy as they are about the Bible.

I wish he had drawn that out a bit more clearly, but still, POJ steers clear of the excesses of the &quot;name and claim it&quot; brand of Pentecostal hucksterism.<br />My biggest complaint, however, is that Wilkinson advocates using the prayer like a Novena (a prayer to a Saint that Catholics repeat over and over again in hopes of achieving health, wealth, marriage, etc.). Novenas are one of the very WORST things about the Catholic faith, and I'd hate to see a similar brand of silliness take hold in Evangelical circles. Wilkinson acknowledges that the prayer isn't important, but the intent. Still, he advocates saying it repeatedly.<br />I also noticed that the NRSV doesn't word the prayer the same as Wilkinson. The NRSV says Jabez prayed that God would keep him from harm, not keep him from causing harm. The NRSV has a much better track record than the NKJV, which quite honestly BITES as a translation, so it's probable that Wilkinson is quoting the verse incorrectly to begin with.	2001-09-05

No one can take that away from him.<br />But this story - which in Mamet's mind is intended to combat bigotry and racism toward Jews - actually enhances bigotry and racism toward other groups that are being marginalized in current American society.<br />Mamet gives us a story where an innocent Jewish man is mistakenly convicted of rape and suffers a harrowing fate at the hands of a lynch mob. Mamet tells us that this happened because of anti-Semitism. Fair enough.<br />Mamet's character then goes on to deliver a two-fisted verbal assualt on Christians of the &quot;evangelical&quot; variety (&quot;they say they've been saved. Saved from what?&quot;), who he portrays as evil, stupid, and lazy. (They bask in &quot;inherited glory,&quot; although they've contributed nothing to society, &quot;invented no vaccines,&quot; as Mamet puts it.)<br />First of all, there is no evidence that the historical killers in this case were &quot;evangelical Christians.&quot; It's a big stretch to say that just because a murder occurred in the south, that it was committed by Bible-thumping Southern Baptists.<br />Second, &quot;evangelical Christians&quot; comprise about 7 to 10 percent of the current American population (a number that is consistently revealed in polls by Gallup, Barna, Smith, etc.). That's about the same as the number of Jews and Muslims in America combined. They are consistently villified as &quot;right-wingers&quot; who want to take over the government, impose a theocracy, and kill homosexuals - none of which is true. (The typical evangelical is a moderate Republican of the John McCain variety.) Aside from the rather sympathetic portrayal of Ned Flanders on the Simpsons, the entire media establishment is arrayed against this one segment of our population. The lies and stereotypes directed against these people are as pernicious and hateful as those directed against the Jews in Nazi Germany. (The Jews, too, were out to take over society, according to the Third Reich.) Mamet's hateful scree against people &quot;who say they've been saved&quot; is just fuel for the fire. It takes a feeble-minded coward to throw himself wholeheartedly into society's accepted mode of bigotry, and well, Mamet lives up.<br />Third, evangelicals are hardly stupid people who bask in &quot;inherited glory&quot; from the Pilgrim days. Evangelical accomplishments are many - from revolutionizing the field of linguistics (Kenneth Pike) and Philosophy (Alvin Plantiga), to improving the lives of millions of Latin Americans after the abysmal failure of Roman Catholicism to confront oppression and injustice, to helping freedom of religion and freedom of speech spread throughout the globe, Evangelicals have contributed much to modern society. Of course, they haven't contributed much to the Entertainment industry, and perhaps that's the only industry Mamet cares about.	2001-09-04

Did it? Nope. Let's be clear about something else: Hal is more than just a dope who took Dispensationalism and Fundamentalist paranoia a bit too seriously. He got rich peddling this stuff. He has a classic Corvette collection (and has had three wives to date, the present one being about 30 years younger than himself).<br />In 100 years, Hal Lindsey will be remembered in footnotes of history books that equate him with past failed prophets like William Miller (the Adventist who predicted the coming of Christ in 1843), Ann Lee (the Shaker founder who declared the start of the new Millennium in the 1840s), Joachim of Italy (the world would end in 1260), Jan Matthys (a Reformation-era doomsayer who caused a Branch-Davidian style slaughter), and Montanus (the original false prophet of doom, who said Jesus would return in Asia Minor in the 2nd century). Like them, Lindsey felt behind him a trail of disappointed, dispirited people who took him seriously. Lindsey predicted that the world would end by 1988 - and guess what, we're still here! A lot of people altered their entire approach to life; they put off college, put off marriage, and did NOTHING to make the world a better place - after all, why help care for the poor, fight the persecution of Christians overseas, or work to stem the moral decline of America when IT'S ALL ABOUT TO GET BLOWN UP ANYWAY. In fact, the rise in abortions, environmental destruction, starvation, disease, etc. is A GOOD THING, because it confirms our FAITH that the RAPTURE is about to happen! Unfortunately, Hal Lindsey's basic system - that the end times were inaugurated with the regathering of Israel in 1948, and that the Anti-Christ will be the man who signs a peace treaty between Israel and its Arab neighbors - has been kept alive in the minds of millions of people thanks to writers like Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, Grant Jefferies, Jack Van Impe, etc. That's too bad, because NOWHERE in the Bible does God say this. (The oft-quoted prophecies in Daniel actually refer to events that were fulfilled in the days of Alexander the Great and the Maccabean revolt, not the coming of the Anti-Christ. If these writers bothered to look up Hannakuh in an encyclopedia, they'd know that.) Someday, I'm sure that someone WILL broker a treaty between Israel and the Arabs. When that happens, millions of American Fundamentalists are going to quit their jobs and go up to a hilltop to await the Rapture. It'll be another black-eye on American Christianity when it doesn't happen.	2001-08-24

More than any other man, he took Fundamentalism's bemusing but harmless emphasis on &quot;Separation&quot; and twisted Fundamentalism in a sub-Biblical, heterodox cult. If you go to an independent Baptist or community Bible chapel today, you are much more likely to hear about the divine inspiration of the King James Bible, various numerological schemes that indicate the date of the Rapture, and other fanciful heresies instead of Christ and Him Crucified. And we owe so much to this man.<br />Fundamentalism had long since become an onerous cancer within Evangelicalism. Legalistic rules had replaced genuine holiness, and totalitarian men with loud voices and small brains had usurped true leaders. Every time an Evangelical wants to share the Gospel, he has to dispel the false impressions left by these so-called &quot;born-again Christians&quot; who are neither.<br />But Ruckman's KJVO movement finally took Fundamentalism outside the Body of Christ. Yes, now Fundamentalists are plainly NOT Christians, so now true Evangelical Christians can simply write them off as a cult rather than trying to explain and justify their braindead hijinks.<br />Thanks, Dr. Ruckman.

Ellerbe's own explanation for these abuses is that Christianity is innately evil and, implicitly, should be expunged from the earth. She claims that Christianity is evil because Christians - *gasp* - think that their religion is actually True.<br />This analysis fails for several reasons.<br />For starters, Ellerbe seems oblivious to the role of the State, except to portray the state as some kind of obedient lap-dog that does the church's evil bidding. But a fair reading of history shows that it is the State that performs these atrocities, not Christianity.  For example, the Anabaptists, the Quakers, and other groups were all Christians, even Fundamentalist by today's standards. They were \\"born-again Christians\\" in the full modern sense of the term.  But they were mercilessly persecuted by the state-run churches of England, Germany, and other nations. The government wanted everyone to be part of their churches so that no one would question the government. This same state of affairs also dominated the Eastern Orthodox world, where the emperor was looked upon as the physical manifestation of the Will of God. In Rome, the Church and the State were merged into one Whole, with disasterous results. In these examples we have rather non-devout, nominal Christians persecuting devote, \\"born-again\\" Christians. It has little to do with God, and everything to do with politics and the State.<br />Ellerbe's idea that Christianity is \\"intolerant\\" simply because it teaches that it's own beliefs are true doesn't stand up to history. The Baptists founded RI with absolute freedom of conscience for all. Have you ever been to a Baptist church? They're hardly wishy-washy Unitarians. You get a hearty dose of born-again, hallelujah, praise-God-I've-been-saved spirituality. But this is the church that gave us freedom of religion and separation of church and state! ...<br />It is an innate part of Biblical Christian teaching that each person chooses to follow or reject Christ. This teaching mitigates strongly against any type of religious coercion. Religious coercion has been characteristic of churches that are the least Biblical in their teachings, such as the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches.<br />Ellerbe also fails to give credit where credit is due. For example, she says that churches supported slavery. Did some southern Christians support slavery? Yes. But EVERYONE supported slavery for thousands of years, without question, until evangelical Protestants in England and America opposed it. Slavery continues in many non-Christian nations. Even in the South, the evangelical churches were opposed to slavery in the 1700s. It wasn't until ....non-Christian influences that they acquiesced to slavery's existence. Without Christianity, I doubt very much that anyone would opposed to slavery, even today.<br />Ellerbe's solution to Christianity's \\"intolerance\\" is that religion should not teach that God is one being with one identity. God should have many faces, like in Hinduism. But does this pantheistic concept of God really lead to tolerance? Right now, in 2001, every Buddhist nation on earth actively persecutes non-Buddhist religions. India is ruled by a Hindu-nationalist party that wants to expel all Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities. Secularist nations in Europe are passing \\"anti-sect\\" legislation to crush unpopular religions like the Jehovah's Witnesses and Scientology. As we can see, Ellerbe's idea that pantheism leads to tolerance is for the birds.<br />This book is also one-sided and anachronistic. Today, it is Christians - particularly the ones who descend from the Anabaptist/Baptist line, the Christians who never really persecuted anyone else - who are being persecuted in Muslim, Communist, Buddhist, Hindu, and Secularist countries. Where is the outcry? Where is the justice? Not from people like Ellerbe, that's for sure.hat's for sure.	2001-08-10

However, it goes on to mercilessly (and inaccurately) bash average Americans and their moral concerns, naively assuming that anyone who opposes abortion or worries that freedom of speech is being eroded by political correctness (a la &quot;gay rights&quot; or a hundred other leftist movements) is in reality just an in-bred, southern fundamentalist.<br />I was particularly annoyed by Lind's arrogant dismissal of &quot;evangelicals&quot; as &quot;right-wing sectarians&quot; and racists. The average evangelical is a non-white woman in a Third World country; in fact, evangelicals are widely despised, and persecuted much like the Jews were prior to World War 2.

Books	1	5	34	N	N	Misunderstands its own question	The publishers at Promethesus have done it again - published another long-winded, pseudo-intellectual tome that proves atheists don't even understand the religious ideas they seek to disprove.<br />Elbert spends most of his book giving a summary of current theories of how the universe sprang from the Big Bang, how life evolved, etc. (Of course, there are many competing ideas on these subjects, but Elbert chooses the ones he likes and passes them off as the unquestioned findings of objective science.) It is not clear why 75% of the book deals with subjects that have little direct bearing on whether or not there is such a thing as a soul. The few sections that deal with the question of the soul seem to assume that the Soul, as taught by Christianity (and especially that nasty, brutish conservative Protestant kind the folks at Promethesus think is trying to take over the country), is simply the substance contained in your brain - your emotions, memories, etc. However, Christianity does not teach this. The Soul is the fundamental essence of a person - what exactly that essence consists of is a matter of mystery. In any event, Christianity doesn't teach an afterlife where the Soul escapes from its bondage in matter and lives happily forever as a Spirit-thing. Christianity and Judaism both teach the Resurrection from the dead - so disproving a Neo-Platonist concept of the Soul simply has no bearing on Christian belief. I'm not even sure that this book is good at refuting Neo-Platonism, since it doesn't address any of the scientific findings that some use to argue for the existence of an immaterial soul (e.g., that the mind can be seen with scientific instruments as an electrical pattern that operates within the matrix of the brain, rather like the software in a computer, and as such, may be capable of transferring to other matrices. A good - and fun - introduction to this idea is in a novel by another atheist, Dan Simmons, called &quot;The Hollow Man.&quot;) Elbert simplyargues that consciousness arises from the brain - that hardly disproves nearly anyone's notion of a soul, except perhaps for people who believe in reincarnation.<br />Elbert's supposed &quot;canvass&quot; of Biblical criticism is even worse. Elbert quotes marginal scholars like Robert Funk and John Dominic Crossan to &quot;prove&quot; that the New Testament is silly, made-up clap-trap. Quoting Robert Funk as an authority on Biblical criticism is like quoting a a UFO cultist as an authority on Astronomy. Real Biblical scholars with actual credentials - like N.T. Wright, Bruce Metzger, Gregory Boyd, etc. - are, on the whole, confident in the historical accuracy of the New Testament. (&quot;Is the Bible True?&quot; by Jefferey Sheler is a much better introduction to the true findings of modern Biblical criticism than Elbert's ulterior-motivated reliance on fringe figures in the field.)<br />I was particular concerned that, at the end of the book, Elbert made a strange foray into public policy. His recommendations were highly Statist, and suggest that he hasn't spent much time thinking about Nazism, Fascism, Communism, or the rest of the 20th century experience. He recommends that students in public schools be indoctrinated in situational ethics, and talks about how fanciful religious notions will disappear as the population becomes more &quot;educated.&quot; (The fact that evangelicals are the most upwardly-mobile population demographic in the United States, while modern &quot;intellectuals&quot; are actually embracing anti-intellectual philosophies of post-modernism essentially demolishes Elbert's thesis, but I can't help wonder what kind of &quot;education&quot; Elbert envisions, and why he sees the State as the ultimate Messiah that will usher in a secular humanist paradise.)<br />Something I found fascinating, however, was the way Elbert proposed that early Christianity &quot;evolved,&quot; and that sects that didn't have as many benefits as the Orthodox brand died out. He suggests that the evolution of religion - which is shaped by human's conscious attempts to create a belief system - follows the same laws as &quot;Darwinism.&quot;<br />I'm getting very tired of the intellectual cognescetti performing some weird kind of alchemy where they turn Alfred North Whitehead into Charles Darwin and neglect to let the rest of us in on the trick. In Darwin's worldview, things evolved by chance. It was all impersonal. There was no mind involved. Religions are shaped by human minds. I don't have a problem with Elbert invoking Whitehead's model, but if Darwin's dead, let us know. Geez, you'd think Darwin had become Jesus Christ to scientists - he's revered so much that they'd rather re-define what Darwin taught than let him lapse into intellectual obscurity.<br />Again, I've read a book that proves atheists don't even understand the debate about reality, let alone have anything worth contributing to it.	2001-07-12

It's easily readable, non-confrontational, and deeply respectful of the Catholic faith while acknowledging its flaws.<br />It is intended as a primer, so it serves best as an introduction to the main issues. There are deeper treatments available. I wish Coffey would have spent more time addressing common Catholic retorts to Biblical arguments, since many of his readers will doubtlessly head straight to their parish priest for an opposing view. For example, Catholics often try to de-fang the fact that the Catholic Church's teachings don't match the Bible by saying that the Bible isn't infallible, the Church is. The Church &quot;picked&quot; the books that went into the Bible. Since Catholics are taught that the Roman Catholic Church is identical to the pre-Constantine, early Christian church (a highly dubious claim, but one that most Catholics accept unreflectively), this argument seems to have some merit. But only on the surface. The historical fact is the NT canon was assembled through common usage by the early church, not by an imperial fiat by the bishop of Rome or a Catholic council. (The Catholic Church did, however, add several books to the OT in the Council of Trent. Neither Jews nor any other Christian church recognize these books.) It would have been worth adding a few pages to the book to anticipate and defeat several common, deceptive debating tricks that Catholics use to defend their dogmas.<br />As an American, I also thought that the one-sided focus on traditionalist Roman Catholicism - the kind that survives in Opus Dei and in the mind of Pope John Paul 2 - was counter-productive. As the negative reviews of this book show, there is no &quot;Catholic&quot; faith anymore. The Catholic Church is a vast employer that provides structural support for a wide variety of different, and often contradictory, ideologies and even whole different religions. For example, your typical &quot;Radical Catholic&quot; who reveres &quot;St. Teilhard de Chardin&quot; and attends a &quot;Cosmic Rave Mass&quot; has virtually nothing in common with a lobotomized cultist who straps a spiked chain to her thigh and whips her buttocks once a week as part of Opus Dei. But both claim to be &quot;true Catholics&quot; and denounce the other. Catholic priests in Latin America do double-duty as Marxist terrorists. Some Catholics drive for hours to go to a Mass in Latin, while others talk about a &quot;synthesis between Hinduism and Catholicism.&quot; Perhaps the best expose of Catholicism's bankruptcy is to expose the fact that modern-day Roman Catholicism is a chaotic marketplace of ideas ranging from religious-right moralism to charismatic Pentecostalism to mystical pantheism, hitting all points inbetween. The only thing these varied sects have in common is a generally collectivist view of human society with non-democratic tendencies - whether these tendencies are expressed in a State-Church concordant or in the mystical scribblings about the &quot;Omega Point&quot; in the writings of Teilhard de Chardin. How can such confusion exist in the &quot;One Holy, Catholic, Apostolic Church?&quot; How can be 55 percent of American Catholics be pro-choice, and an even larger majority condone homosexuality? The best way to defeat traditionalist Catholicism is to point out that it is, in fact, the minority position within the supposedly &quot;infallible&quot; church, at least one these shores.	2001-07-09

There are some decent nuggets of information in this book, but unfortunately, Boston's personal contempt for evangelical Protestants (who are identified in toto with the Religious Right, even though only 12 percent of evangelicals self-identify with the movement)and refusal to understand issues from the Right's point of view bury them too deep in the book to make it worth reading.<br />Boston's definition of the &quot;Religious Right&quot; ranges from self-professed authoritarians like Pat Robertson to rather moderate, center-right figures like Chuck Colson, who has crusaded for more humane treatment of prisoners and often partnered with the ACLU on behalf of inmates. Apparently, opposition to homosexuality as a morally-benign lifestyle is enough to merit being condemned as a fundamentalist proto-fascist in Boston's book.<br />There are some alarming Right-wing figures who attempt to use Christian terminology to advance an anti-democratic vision. For example, Gary North and R.J. Rushdoony want a Fascist state based on Levitical law. (Their influence on Pat Robertson was not inconsiderable.) Some folks regard Oliver North as a hero. But for the most part, these people are fringe. The Moral Majority is dead. The Christian Coalition is bankrupt. Focus on the Family is the only real juggernaut left, and even their detractors admit they're one of the more moderate Christian Right groups. Boston couldn't even bring himself to label the Promise Keepers - the largest &quot;group-hug&quot; organization in the world - a Christian Right movement.<br />Who can really believe that born-again Christians - the vast majority of whom are either African Americans or Ned Flanders-clones - are really an army of black shirts ready to take over the government?   <br />Boston is part of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a group headed by a United Church of Christ minister. For those who don't know much about the UCC, perhaps a refresh is in order. The UCC is an uber-leftwing, self-admitted &quot;post-Christian&quot; denomination that can be roughly identified with every nutty vestige of Political Correctness and sectarian Marxist silliness in America. Before Boston complains about groups trying to influence politics with their beliefs, he should take a look in the mirror.	2001-07-06
US	48157614	R3E23ZG4NTNKLH	0716744783	205740422	The Triumph of Evolution: and the Failure of Creationism	Books	1	15	39	N	N	Fundamental misunderstanding of the subject	This book purports to prove Darwinian evolution and defeat Creationism, but I found it to give a weak defense of Darwinism, and to misunderstand the &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; movement, a theistic-evolution alternative that the author clumsily tags as &quot;creationist.&quot; Let me explain why:<br />- Virtually the entire defense of Darwinism given in this book boils down to a defense that the earth is, in fact, billions of years old. While it is true that some Seventh Day Adventists, Pentecostals, and fundamentalist sects believe that the earth is 10,000 years old, the biggest challenge to evolution today comes from the Intelligent Design movement - Phillip Johnson, Michael Behe, and other IDs readily admit the earth is billions of years old. They even admit that life likely resulted from a gradual process. They just argue that God did it. Disproving a young age for the earth does not prove evolution.<br />- The author actually plays into the hands of the Intelligent Design movement by offering examples of evolution that are in fact examples of intelligent design or even DE-EVOLUTION. In an attempt to be clever, the author cites the example of the King James Bible. The medieval Greek texts that the KJV translators used as the basis of the KJV have a number of minor differences in spelling, word order, phraseology, etc. than the earlier Greek manuscripts on which the NIV, NRSV, and modern Bibles are based. This, to the author, is evolution. The Biblical text changed over time. Life forms, like texts, change over time. <br />Is this a good example of evolution? NO! It's an example of entropy. The KJV is an inferior Bible, with mispellings, omitted phrases, repeated phrases, and other flaws that resulted from scribal mistakes. If the KJV text was genetic code, the animal would suffer from cancer and neurological diseases. The example of text families changing over time doesn't prove evolution, because generally speaking, literary works that were hand-copied by scribes became inferior in quality as time went on. Even when you can argue that a textual change introduced by a scribe was an improvement, it's almost always because the change was intentionally introduced by a scribe to &quot;improve&quot; the original author's work. In this case, textual evolution is an example of design.<br />-  The author says that Intelligent Design isn't science because the movement proposes that science should be able to hypothesize whether the universe was designed by an intelligent force. He says that science, by its nature, cannot do this. But why? Science should be able to look at an object - for example, a tall building - and determine that it was made by design. If evolutionary biology can't pass a basic real-world test like that, what good is it? The whole paradigm is in question. In many other disciplines - e.g., String Theory and Particle Physics - scientists are talking about &quot;Mind&quot; as a basic component of reality. Evolutionary biology simply hasn't caught up to these sciences by refusing to consider the place of Mind in the universe.<br />- There is a growing trend among evolutionists to quietly morph &quot;Darwinian evolution&quot; into &quot;Whiteheadian evolution&quot; without letting the reading public know about the massive paradigm shift that has just taken place. (A good overview of Whiteheadian\Teilhardian evolution is found in The Biotech Century by Jeremy Rifkin.) There is some evidence of this semantical legermain in this book. If Darwinism hasn't become an unquestionable ideology, then how come scientists go to great lengths to deny the fact that Darwinism is steadily losing ground in the academy to a competing vision, and that their only recourse is to re-define the word &quot;Darwinism&quot; into something entirely different than what Darwin himself meant? (Darwin thought the word was pure chance, not the outcome to pre-determined mathematical laws that disposed natural selection toward the emergence of complex, conscious life forms. According to Darwin, an alligator could just as easily have been the ultimate winner of natural selection as a human being, if conditions were right.)<br />The evidence is mounting against the Darwinian paradigm. Whether you opt for Whitehead or for Intelligent Design, you're still more progressive and openminded than a Darwinist.	2001-07-05

Dr. Ross does an excellent job in showing that one doesn't need to adhere to the belief that the earth is 10,000 years old to believe the Bible. (The hysterical tone of the Young Earth Creationists who have reviewed the book on Amazon show the ultimate bankruptcy of this position.) This book has three key strengths:<br />1. It shows that Christians of earlier generations didn't believe in the Young Earth model. Ross confines himself mostly to ancient Christian writings, but he could just as easily have included writings from the founders of Fundamentalism in the 20th century, who didn't believe in the Young Earth position expounded by their heirs.<br />2. It shows that all the arguments put forth by Young Earth creationists are based on false information.<br />3. It shows how the Bible doesn't contradict modern science.<br />At long last, the spiritual poison of Young Earth Creationism is being drained from the Church. The Presbyterian Church in America decisively rejected Young Earthism in 2001 - this gives me hope that in coming years, Young Earthers will be forced to relinquish their totalitarian hold on the Baptist Bible Fellowship International, the General Association of Regular Baptists, and other denominations that have been caught in grip of lies and deceptions that limit their ability to share the gospel. It certainly dashes all hopes of Young Earthers for a position within the SBC. To all thoughful Christians in the aforementioned denominations: continue the fight! The Young Earthers are losing, as more and more people really read the Bible and understand what it says. You will see truth prevail in the BBF and other Fundamentalist denominations in your generation!	2001-06-22

But I do not believe in Creationism. Here's why:<br />1. Creationism really isn't about disproving evolution - it's about proving the earth is 6-10K years old. The Bible does not teach this. You need to ignore the massive evidence of the Bible that implicitly, if not overtly, says that the Genesis creation account is symbolic. (E.g., the Bible refers to the 2,000 years of the Christian era as the &quot;the last days&quot; when compared with the totality of the universe's existence; the OT prophets use the age of the Earth as a metaphor for the eternity of God; Genesis 2:4 in the more literal translations says that the creation days were &quot;the generations of heaven and earth,&quot; indicating their symbolic usage, etc.)<br />2. This unBiblical teaching urges Christians to circle the wagons and shut out the world around them. It does not encourage them to be salt and light in a dying world. I know NO ONE who has ever been saved as a result of Young-Earth Creationism.<br />3. If you accept that everything in the Bible - even when the context of the passage, the literary form, and the rest of the Bible itself indicate otherwise - is to be interpreted in a woodenly literal sense, then there is MUCH MORE in the early Genesis accounts that has to be taken literally. For instance, the Serpent in the Garden of Eden was not Satan, but a talking snake. Also, the early chapters of Genesis talk about the earth having &quot;four corners,&quot; talk about God has if God had a human body with arms and legs, and present God as &quot;repenting,&quot; changing his mind, &quot;grieving,&quot; and doing other things that we know God does not do thanks to the advanced revelation of the later OT prophets and the New Testament. If you accept Young Earth Creationism, then you also have to accept Open Theism (the belief that God doesn't know the future and can make mistakes, change his mind, etc.), because they both approach the Scriptures in the same woodenly literal way.<br />4. Young Earth Creationism was created by the Seventh Day Adventist Church. Morris even admits this. Christians throughout all the previous ages - long before Darwin - have acknowledged that the language of Genesis 1-3 is symbolic. Young Earth Creationism is a destructive, divisive movement spawned by a borderline heretical denomination that predicted that Christ would return in 1844. This hardly bodes well for the movement.<br />There ARE good critiques of Darwinism out there - Michael Behe's &quot;Darwin's Black Box,&quot; William Dembeski's work, and Philip Johnson's &quot;Defeating Darwinism&quot; all attack Darwinism effectively and fatally. But let's forget this nonsense about the Earth being 10,000 years old. All it does is let Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins off the hook - they just need to look at the sky at night, proving the world IS more than 10,000 years old, and they think they've proven there is no God. Let's make evolutionists fight the real battles.	2001-06-21

To this generation of Christians: please, please, please do not repeat the mistakes of previous generations. The earth is more than 10,000 years old - the Bible says so. The OT prophets called the earth &quot;ancient,&quot; comparing the earth's age to the eternity of God. Jesus and Paul said the last era of history - now 2,000 years long - are &quot;the last days&quot; compared to the entire scope of history. Genesis 2:4 in the more literal translations say that the &quot;days&quot; of creations are symbolic of the &quot;generations&quot; of heaven and earth.<br />If you believe, as Baugh suggests, that the early Genesis account is absolutely literal in all details, with no symbolism despite what later Bible passages indicate, then you must accept these other beliefs:<br />- Man fell due to a talking Snake, not Satan, since it is later Biblical passages that make it clear the Snake was symbolic of Satan. - The earth is flat and covered with a metallic dome, since the Bible talks about &quot;four corners&quot; of the Earth and the &quot;firament&quot; of the sky. - Worst of all, you have to accept that God doesn't know the future and is able to make mistakes. The early portion of Genesis says on several occasions that God &quot;repented,&quot; that he changed his mind, that he &quot;learned,&quot; that he &quot;went down to see what was happening,&quot; etc. But the Bible later gives us a fuller picture where we see that God is eternal and beyond change - just like the Bible later tells us that the earth is much more than 10,000 years old.<br />Young Earth Creationism has devestated churches, ruined the lives of faithful Christians, and contributed no good to God's people. In fact, it was started by the Seventh Day Adventist Church. Its leading proponent, Henry Morris, has recently joined with a cult group that denies that Jesus is the eternally begotten Son of God and teaches that God &quot;re-wrote&quot; the Bible in 1611. Jesus said we'd know them by their fruits. Young Earth Creationism is bitter fruit indeed.	2001-06-21

I live within miles of the site, and I have seen the prints myself. They are three-toed dinosaur prints, not human prints. Carl Baugh has shamed himself not only as a sloppy, unoriginal thinker (others have used this argument before), but as a liar. Young Earth Creationists lie to honest, sincere Christians who seek the truth.<br />I am a Bible-believing Christian - and the Bible teaches that the earth is OLD. Jesus and Paul taught that the Christian age - now at 2000 years - would be the &quot;last days&quot; compared to the sweep of human history. OT prophets called the earth &quot;ancient&quot; and used the age of the earth as a metaphor for the eternity of God. Genesis 2:4 in the more literal translations (the NRSV brings out the nuance wonderfully) says that the creation &quot;days&quot; were symbolic of the &quot;generations of heaven and earth.&quot;<br />Young Earth Creationism is a product of the Seventh Day Adventist Church - the same folks who said Christ would return in 1844, spun off the Jehovah's Witnesses, and condemned Sunday worship as the mark of the Beast. It is utterly foreign to historical Biblical teaching. Its effect in groups like the BBFI and the PCA has been devestating - literally MILLIONS of people have been persuaded that the Gospel is false because modern science &quot;disproves&quot; the Bible. Churches have expelled honest, God-fearing people who wouldn't lie about their  beliefs and about what the Bible really taught. All the while, people have laughed at and ridiculed Christians, assuming that evolution and atheism were true just because the earth was old.<br />Christian, you will know them by their fruits. Young Earth Creationism is bad fruit. If you want to dispute Darwin, read honest books like Darwin's Black Box by Michael Behe or Darwin on Trial by Phillip Johnson.

The truth is that the &quot;third wave&quot; of democracy was unleashed by Pope John of the Vatican Second Council - the great events like the collapse of Communism simply happened on JP's watch. JP himself has been a retrograde Pope determined to restore the totalitarian &quot;old church.&quot; He has only supported &quot;democracy&quot; in countries where Catholics are persecuted. In countries where Catholics are the PERSECUTORS - e.g., Latin America, the Baltics, etc. - JP has encouraged them to continue their persecution. JP has encouraged violence and repression against Baptists, Pentecostals, and other anabaptistic Christians in these countries, and has overturned the positive gestures of Vatican II with a recent statement that said non-Catholics weren't Christians in the true sense, nor where their communities churches.<br />I am not a &quot;Jack Chick&quot; anti-Catholic. You can read about JP's true record, with its faults, in Their Blood Cries Out, a book about Christian persecution in the 20th century. This book points out that Catholics are persecuted in some countries, but are often persecutors - with Papal support - in others. I don't want to embarrass American Catholics, who really want to believe that Vatican 2 stuck, and that the black days of their church are behind them, but I see no reason for American Catholics to give a lopsided, rose-glass view of a pope who considers other Christians to be scum beneath contempt.	2001-06-13

In 100 years, Hal Lindsey will be remembered in footnotes of history books that equate him with past failed prophets like William Miller (the Adventist who predicted the coming of Christ in 1843), Ann Lee (the Shaker founder who declared the start of the new Millennium in the 1840s), Joachim of Italy (the world would end in 1260), Jan Matthys (a Reformation-era doomsayer who caused a Branch-Davidian style slaughter), and Montanus (the original false prophet of doom, who said Jesus would return in Asia Minor in the 2nd century). Like them, Lindsey felt behind him a trail of disappointed, dispirited people who took him seriously. Lindsey predicted that the world would end by 1988 - and guess what, we're still here! A lot of people altered their entire approach to life; they put off college, put off marriage, and did NOTHING to make the world a better place - after all, why help care for the poor, fight the persecution of Christians overseas, or work to stem the moral decline of America when IT'S ALL ABOUT TO GET BLOWN UP ANYWAY. In fact, the rise in abortions, environmental destruction, starvation, disease, etc. is A GOOD THING, because it confirms our FAITH that the RAPTURE is about to happen!<br />Unfortunately, Hal Lindsey's basic system - that the end times were inaugurated with the regathering of Israel in 1948, and that the Anti-Christ will be the man who signs a peace treaty between Israel and its Arab neighbors - has been kept alive in the minds of millions of people thanks to writers like Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, Grant Jefferies, Jack Van Impe, etc. <br />That's too bad, because NOWHERE in the Bible does God say this. (The oft-quoted prophecies in Daniel actually refer to events that were fulfilled in the days of Alexander the Great and the Maccabean revolt, not the coming of the Anti-Christ. If these writers bothered to look up Hannakuh in an encyclopedia, they'd know that.) Someday, I'm sure that someone WILL broker a treaty between Israel and the Arabs.When that happens, millions of American Fundamentalists are going to quit their jobs and go up to a hilltop to await the Rapture. It'll be another black-eye on American Christianity when it doesn't happen.	2001-06-12

Rifkin's book falls somewhere between economics, biology, futurism, sociology, and theology - and it's a masterful blend.<br />Rifkin lays out the potential of the new genetic science (curing diseases, ending our dependence on environmentally-destructive technologies) and underlines the risks (genetic warfare, eugenics, genetic contamination of natural species). But I was the most impressed by his analysis of how the new science offers a new paradigm for understanding nature, humanity, and our place in the universe. I have read similar treatments from a number of scientists, but Rifkin's was by far the most accessible and compact. The new paradigm is a shift away from Darwinism, which holds that life evolved through a random process of natural selection, toward a view that life is the driving force of its own evolution, changing its shape through the way it interracts with the environment - the upswing of this is that life is an evolution of consciousness. Life evolves based on how it chooses to evolve. Our deliberate control of genetics is seen as an extension of life's evolution toward greater conscious control of its own destiny. (If I fail to adequately convey the substance of the new paradigm, my apologies.) The new view of evolution is in sync with &quot;process theology&quot; proposed by A. Whitehead and championed by figures like Salvador Dali, among others, and chaos theory. Rifkin doesn't use this term, but on the popular level, I think many people will immediately recognize this line of pantheistic thinking as &quot;New Age.&quot; I couldn't help but be reminded of the &quot;evolutionary messiah&quot; motif of films like the Matrix, Dune, and Dark City. <br />According to Rifkin, societies always invent a cosmological understanding of how nature works that mirrors the way their society is organized. Darwinism came about from 19th-century Englishmen reading Capitalism - with its emphasis on competition and survival of the fittest - into nature. As a result, western society was able to assure itself that laissez-faire capitalism, despite its brutality, was the way the world was supposed to work, because it was exhibited in nature itself. In the process, Darwinism overthrew theism as the reigning ideology among society's elite and substituted atheism.<br />Now society is creating a new cosmology - a form of pantheism that makes humankind the ultimate manifestation and guiding agent of cosmic Mind.  This cosmology mirrors the networked, nodal existence of our computerized world, where &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; has been replaced by the survival of those best able to acquire, adapt, and manipulate information. <br />Rifkin points out that if we are to challenge the indiscriminate use of genetic engineering, we must fight the new paradigm before it becomes taken for granted in society. Once people accept the assumption that nature is inherently mutable and re-shapes itself according to its will, then those who argue against genetic tampering will be viewed much the way Young Earth Creationists are viewed today. To most people's minds, genetic engineering will be right and natural - and to protest it will be ridiculous.<br />The unanswered question is this: how do we fight the new paradigm? If Darwinism was simply the result an English botanist reading Capitalism into nature, then what is the truth about how nature works? Rifkin doesn't offer any suggestions. <br />I personally think that the Intelligent Design movement led by Phillip Johnson, William Dembeski, and Michael Behe stands the best chance to proposing an alternative vision of how nature works - and restraining indiscriminate use of genetic engineering. Intelligent Design is a Christian ideology. It explains genetics as the result of a transcendent God who designed the nature of each living thing (with some potential for adaptive change). As such, the genetic differences between species are part of the Creator's design, and not something to be tampered with lightly. Darwinism will fall - and with it, the last fortress of Modernism. Freud and Marx have both fallen, kicking out two legs of the Modernist troika. Once Darwinism falls - and the sheer implausibility of natural selection and the incompatibility of natural selection with molecular biology assures us that it will - western society will plunge headlong into a postmodern era. The battle for the postmodern mind might easily be a battle between Intelligent Design and pantheistic process evolution. One theory holds that life is a creation of God - the other holds that life is evolving to become God. <br />(I think the growing influence of the new cosmology is behind the unfounded attacks on this author and this book, especially from the &quot;post-human&quot; disciples of utopian secular humanists like Julian Simon and Gregg Easterbook. Rifkin has come much too close to hitting the nail on the head.)<br />That's why the Biotech Century, although not an expressly Christian book, is required reading for all modern Christians.	2001-05-29

But if this book represents the current state of Catholic thought - and Pope JP2's recent Catholic Fundamentalism suggests that it does - then we're all in deep trouble.<br />Protestants are called &quot;heretics.&quot; Jews and Protestants conspired together to pervert the Scriptures. The Catholic Church is the only true Church, and outside its totalitarian structure, there is no salvation. Marian apparitions are taken at face value. Thirty years of ecumenism have left no mark on this author's faith. You may as well read the Baltimore Catechism or the Douay Rheims Bible - two deep embarassments for modern Catholics - as read this piece of polemic tripe.<br />Of course, the author can't make these charges against Jews and Protestants using the TRUTH. Therefore, he gleefully resorts to lies. Here are a couple:<br /> - Jews met in Jamnia in the early second century to &quot;remove&quot; the deutrocanonical books from the canon and distort the Masoretic Text of the Old Testament to obscure the Church's true teachings. Protestants adopted this purposefully-corrupt canon to support their &quot;heretical&quot; teachings.  - All other Christian churches separated from the Catholic church, and the Catholic church is the one real church.<br />Let's dismantle these lies one-by-one. First, there is no evidence that the Jews ever &quot;truncated&quot; their canon. The deuterocanonical books themselves (e.g., Sirach) say that the Jewish/Protestant canon of OT books is the authoritative list. The author of 2 Maccabees expressly says that his book is NOT inspired scripture. There is no evidence that Tobit, Judith, or other books were ever included in the Septuagint - their supposed source - before the time of St. Augustine, who was the first major personality in the church to argue for their inclusion in the Scripture. The Jewish philosopher Philo said the Septuagint DID NOT include these books when it was originally translated. Jerome, who translated the Latin Vulgate, said these books were not inspired. <br />The idea that the Jews determined their canon at the &quot;Jamnian council&quot; in the second century is a myth that was proposed for propaganda purposes in the 1870s. There is no record of any such council in history. The truth is that Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, etc. were declared to be Scripture at the Council of Trent. The Roman Catholic Church added this books to the Bible; the Protestants did not take them away. Of course, this theory is highly Anti-Semitic, and Anti-Semitism is one of many historical STAINS on the Catholic church.<br /> - Not all churches descend from Rome. The Eastern Church was never under Rome's authority, and has its own distinct lineage from the early Christians. The Coptic, Ethiopian, and other churches have no historical relationship with Rome. Also, there is no record of any Catholic churches becoming &quot;Baptist.&quot; The Anabaptist line of churches (Baptist, Mennonite, Waldenese, etc.) appears entirely independent from the Catholic church throughout history. Indeed, it was openly acknowledged at the Council of Trent that the Anabaptists had been a pain in the Catholic Church's side for the previous 1200 years (when the Catholic church was formed under Constantine). <br />The Catholic church's claim to be the one true church is a claim of THEOLOGY, not HISTORY. <br />It's apparent that the Catholic Church has slid down a slippery rail toward Fundamentalism, triumphalism, and intolerance. The great strides toward TRUTH that Catholicism has made in the last 30 years are about to be washed away by this fundamentalist resurgence in the RCC. I pray for American Catholics who have tasted something better - dark days are ahead for you.	2001-04-27

But its take on how the early Christians understood Jesus is severely flawed - in essence, it's a rehash of the old Enlightenment-era theory that Jesus was simply a good man who was later deified by the Christian Church. Cahill says that none of the early Christians - Paul, Peter, Mark, etc. - considered Jesus to be God, and that the idea that Jesus is God doesn't even appear in the New Testament until the late-written Gospel of John.<br />This is false. Colosssians, which is one of the earliest New Testament books written, says that &quot;In him the fullness of God was pleased to dwell (Colossians 1:19, NRSV).&quot; In Phillipians, Paul says that Jesus, &quot;through he was in the very form of God, didn't consider equality with God something to be exploited.&quot; The writer of Hebrews, a close associate of Paul, speaks of Christ with these words: &quot;Your throne, O God, will last forever.&quot; Paul calls Jesus &quot;God and Savior&quot; in Titus 2:13, and the &quot;mystery of godliness, who was manifest in the flesh,&quot; in 1 Timothy 3:16. Peter calls Jesus &quot;God and Savior&quot; in 2 Peter 1:1. Mark demonstrates Jesus' divinity by portraying him as the Lord of the Sabbath, Lord of the Scripture, Lord of the spiritual realm, and Lord of nature. Luke, quoting Peter, calls Jesus the &quot;Author of Life,&quot; i.e., the creator of the world, in Acts 3:15.<br />Bruce Metzger, chairman of the NRSV translation committee, points out that not one word in 1,000 is doubted as to its authenticity in the New Testament text, and none of the remaining uncertainties about the New Testament text affect what the New Testament teaches. The bottom line is that the New Testament is replete with references to Christ's deity, and the only explanation for that is that the early Christians believed it, and Jesus himself taught it.<br />The theory that Jesus was a good man who was later &quot;deified&quot; has no merit. If Jesus taught that he was God, then he is either a lunatic on par with Sun Myung Moon and David Koresh, or he is God. The Jews understood this clearly - that's why the Talmud portrays Jesus as deceiving the people through sorcery. If Jesus was a lunatic, then there is no reason to credit him with improving the course of history. If he is God, then we must respond to him as God. You can't respond to Jesus simply as a &quot;good man, a moral teacher.&quot; He didn't leave that option open. He didn't intend to.as later &quot;deified&quot; has no merit.

It is true that there were those who defended the KJV as infallible - [people] like Edward Hill, for example. But this defense has always been based on these people's irrational unwillingness to accept that the KJV isn't perfect, a fact that even the KJV translators themselves acknowledged. You can't defend the KJV as perfect without inventing new doctrines that aren't found in the KJV - namely that God inspired the KJV translators to magically &quot;restore&quot; the perfect Bible. (Claiming that the TR, not the KJV, is inspired, like Mr. Cloud does, is simply a dodge. There is no substantial difference between Cloud and Ruckman.)<br />Here are the real FACTS:<br />- There is no Greek manuscript that reads exactly like the KJV. All manuscripts have significant differences from the KJV. For example, none contain 1 John 5:7. None contain Acts 9:5b-6a. The overwhelming majority call Christ &quot;Lord and God&quot; in Rev. 4:11, not just &quot;Lord,&quot; as in the KJV. None say &quot;book of life&quot; rather than &quot;tree of life&quot; in the closing verses of Revelation. Most teach the Trinity in Acts 16:7, where the KJV does not. Cloud cannot show a line of Greek manuscripts - or even a single manuscript - that matches the KJV. His theory of &quot;preservation&quot; fails. It simply didn't happen. He knows this, of course - I told him. But don't expect him to amend his books any time soon.<br />- The modern Bibles and the &quot;Neutral Text&quot; that underlies them teach the deity of Christ 2.5 times more often than the TR and the KJV. Fetch an NIV and compare: John 1:18, Colossian 1:19, Acts 3:15, Titus 2:3, 2 Peter 1:1, Rev. 4:11, etc. That's just to get started. If the Netural Text was, in fact, a systematic attempt to re-write the Bible, why does it teach the deity of Christ more often than the KJV? Why does it teach the Trinity in spotsthe KJV does not? Isn't it more likely that the KJV was just based on lousy manuscripts - after all, human beings are in a degenerative sinful condition, so wouldn't copies that are far removed from the original be more apt, all things being equal, to corruption?<br />- Some textual critics were, in fact, liberals. But so what? Their work has been reviewed tirelessly by evangelical and fundamentalist scholars, the VAST MAJORITY of whom have accepted the work as valid, with no sign of dishonesty and doctrinal bias. Again, if such were the case, why would these &quot;liberals&quot; give us a Bible that teaches Jesus is God MORE OFTEN than the KJV? Spurgeon, Scofield, Rice, Ankenburg, Machen, Schaeffer, Halley, Jones, Wyrtzen, and just about every other Fundamentalist who left an enduring name accepted and even embraced the Revised Version and other modern Bibles.	2001-03-27

I have read this work and many others by Cloud (their contents are all available for free on the web), and they are all deceptive. They use the best techniques of pseudo-science: selective use of quotations, outdated studies, etc. The methodology of this and other works by Cloud is similar to Holocaust Denial, Flat Earthism, UFOlogy, and every other wacky piece of &quot;documented evidence&quot; out there.<br />Cloud is threatened by the SBC because he fears that many independent Baptists - a group he preys upon with his KJV-Only doctrine - will join the SBC. Once they do that, they won't be open to be manipulated by him, Peter Ruckman, D.A. Waite, and all his other doctrinally-aberrant, sub-Christian cohorts. They'll stop buying his books, and stop sending him money.<br />Here's the crux of his argument - a study in the 1960s showed that seminary students were being led to doubt their faith by liberals in the SBC's seminaries. These same seminary students must have become SBC pastors, and are still out there, preaching liberalism in the SBC.<br />Nonsense. The SBC definitively rejected any form of liberalism; their 2000 Baptist Faith and Message is so conversative that it's better labeled &quot;Fundamentalist&quot; than &quot;Evangelical.&quot; Liberals have opted out - they're in the CBF. Of course, Mr. Cloud does not distinguish between the CBF and the SBC, and he's more than happy to harp on the CBF as if that proves the SBC is liberal.<br />The Independent Baptist movement was a failure. It led to nothing but the degeneration and doctrinal decay of northern Baptists. With folks like Brad Phelps of God Hates Fags and Greg Dixon of the Indianapolis Baptist Temple now claiming the spotlight for independent Baptists, it's time for all northern Baptists to re-evaluate their polity and re-join our brothers in partnership, mission, and the Great Commission. That doesn't mean we should join the SBC - it's too Southern. But there are the Baptist General Conference, the North American Baptist Conference, Conservative Baptists, the GARB, and literally dozens of conservative, evangelical denominations that can be excellent homes for our congregations, and help keep us all safe from WOLVES like David Cloud, Gail Riplinger, Sam Gipp, et. al.	2001-03-27

His &quot;scholar society,&quot; the Dean Burgon Society, takes the name of a scholar who didn't believe the TR was infallible, but instead advocated a different approach to textual criticism than that advanced by Wescott and Hort. (Burgon, for example, didn't believe that 1 John 5:7 belonged in the Bible.)Waite distorts this man's beliefs and name for his own gain.<br />This book is no better. Aside from the frequent use of caps and boldface that clearly mark this book as the product of an inferior mind, the book is totally dishonest and avoids dealing the real issues. (If you can dig up an old copy of the KJV-Only 'zine &quot;O Timothy,&quot; you'll find an article where Waite admits that he never really understood his subject matter in seminary. Waite's &quot;testimony&quot; is right next to that Ian Paisley, an Orange militia leader in Northern Ireland who's best known for stirring up violence in his home country. Such great men lead the KJV-Only movement...)<br />Here are facts:<br />* Modern Bibles like the NAS and NIV teach the deity of Christ and the Trinity more often than the KJV (compare 2 Pet. 1:1, Col. 1:19, John 1:18, Acts 16:7, etc.) In fact, the KJV has profound Christological defects in Acts, Romans, Titus, and Colossians. If the modern Bibles were intentionally corrupt, why do they lift Christ's name higher than the KJV?<br />* Virtually all great Christian leaders - from Spurgeon to Scofield - embraced textual criticism with joy. Textual criticism assures us that the Bible is accurate and was faithfully transmitted to us by previous generations. Even blatant liberals admit this. Bruce Metzger of the NRSV (liberal translation) committee says that not one word in 1,000 in the NT is doubted, and nothing of doctrinal importance is affected. Anti-Christians like John Crossan, Marcus Borg, and John Spong don't argue that the text is corrupt - they just argue that the text is made up of myths and lies.<br />* There is no Greek textthat matches the KJV is all details. The idea that the KJV somehow represents the &quot;Majority Text&quot; is a lie, plain and simple. Get a complete version of the NKJV. It has notes on the MJ text. The MJ text often agrees with the Alexandrian Text - especially in verses that have profound doctrinal importance, like Acts 16:7 and John 5:7. If God supposedly preserved his Word through a continual stream of perfectly-copied Greek manuscripts, where are they? Isn't it more likely that God preserved his Word the same way he did in 2 Kings 22-23? That's exactly what happened in the Alexandrian Text. (When I slammed David Cloud with this argument, even he had to acknowledge the TR/KJV is imperfect and doesn't represent the original texts.)<br />* KJV-Onlyists don't even behave like Christians. I hate to judge people, but let's call a spade a spade! Are paranoia, slander, deception, dishonesty, rage, spite, and authoritarianism the KJV's &quot;fruit of the spirit?&quot;	2001-03-23

(The NIV translates &quot;molten mirror&quot; as &quot;burnished bronze.&quot; So does the KJV.) No. It isn't. Does this mean that the Bible isn't true? No. The Bible is the absolute, revealed truth about man's relationship with God, eternity, morality, etc. But the Bible is not a book about science. There are parts of the Bible that show an amazing pre-modern insight into the scientific realities that we've only discovered in our own time, like the Big Bang (creation ex nilo), the spherical shape of the earth, the thermodynamic decay of the universe, etc. But the Bible isn't primarily concerned about science. Trying to take every statement in the Bible in its absolute literal sense will just get you in trouble, as this verse from Job proves.<br />Morris has made a career out of advancing a slavishly literal reading of the Bible, and in the process devestated and divided many churches. Recently he has started advancing the KJV-Only doctrine, apparently having decided that he hasn't done enough damage already. The Bible itself doesn't support this kind of ultra-literal reading: Gen. 2:4 says the creation days are &quot;generations&quot; of heaven and earth, indicating that the creation hymn was symbolic! Even my Fundamentalist Sunday School teachers acknowledged that the Bible is to be taken symbolically when it itself calls a passage symbolic! <br />Leave Henry Morris alone.

It does not use any known or accepted Greek text as the basis. Instead, it uses a marginal scholar's attempt to reconstruct the Textus Receptus based on the King James Bible. In other words, it takes the English translation and works backwards. (It differs from the actual Stephanus TR in more than 250 places, to boot, so fans of the KJV will find no solace here.)<br />2. It reproduces that same scholar's vitrolic and immensely wrong attack on Westcott and Hort in the introduction. It asserts - without any shred of evidence, historical or theological - that God used the Greek Orthodox Church to safeguard the scriptures in their pure form, and that future discoveries will prove the Alexandrian Text to be a perversion. What a laugh! Numerous discoveries of fragments and Uncial manuscripts since the time this was written have shown that the Alexandrian Text, especially Codex B, IS the very words of the New Testament, with a continuous scribal tradition from the earliest days of the church. The bitterness and spite F.A. Scrivner shovels out in his introduction should be enough to steer anyone away from this tome, except perhaps those that want it for historical reference of the Alexandrain vs. Majority Text debates.<br />This interlinear is only good for people who want to study what the KJV would read like in Greek. It does not give you a pure, historical, and doctrinally-superior text to work from. This perpetuates the worst of the KJV's blunders, such as omitting the deity of our Lord in numerous passages - John 1:18, Col. 1:19, Jude 4, etc., and teaching salvation by works in Rev. 22:14. <br />I recommend an interlinear that uses the NA text, which underlies superior translations like the NASB-95 and NIV.	2001-03-13

He e-mailed back that my list was &quot;highly inaccurate,&quot; without explaining how an open comparison of verses from the two Bibles could possibly be less-than-truthful, and implied that I was a stooge of the diabolical James White. I have to thank him for turning me on to this great author! White does a fine job exposing the false assumptions, innane conduct, and outright lies promulgated by the cultic KJV-Only movement - which is neither Baptist nor Fundamentalist in the true sense. There is absolutely nothing that can be refuted on scholarly or Biblical grounds in this book. This book should be widely read and provided to independent Baptist pastors everywhere. The only complaint I have is that White refrains from going for the jugular in some cases - those of us who use the NASB/NIV are slow to criticize the KJV, but the fact is, the modern Bibles teach the deity of Christ, salvation by faith and the Trinity MORE times than the KJV. In other words, the KJV is INFERIOR. It isn't just &quot;variant,&quot; it's worse! If you doubt that, fetch an NASB and a KJV and flop your Bibles open to John 1:18, Col. 1:19, 2 Pet. 2:1, Jude 4, etc. The Peter Ruckman's and David Cloud's of this world not only want you to use a Bible that's linguistically incomprehensible (does anyone know what &quot;wot&quot; means?), but doctrinally inferior!	2001-03-13

It's failed as philosophy (postmodernism). It's failed as science (thanks to the proof of the Big Bang, among other things). Now it's failed to even produce a thought-provoking objection to Christianity, its dreaded nemesis.  This book has nothing new or original to say.  It rehashes old liberal theories about the Bible's origins (Yahweh was just a Hebrew war god, the gospels distort the historical Jesus, etc.) that have been thoroughly refuted by scholars like N.T. Wright. At best it refutes certain ill-conceived interpretations of the Bible (for example, young-earth creationism), but offers nothing to dissuade a thinking Christian. I'd give this book zero stars if I could; I have never read a book with less intellectual merit than this one.<br />What I took away from this book was that Charles Templeton is a very sad, maladjusted man, driven by personal demons and an inability to accept his own failures and faults.<br />In the 21st century, it is the Christian, not the atheist, who is the true intellectual.	2001-01-24

The same critiques apply to this book - and this book has an  Anti-Christ who resembles Dracula, to boot! But after I posted my first  review, I got a series of e-mails from a right-wing crackpot who attacked  my faith, my honesty, and my personal morals because I dared to criticize  this great work of God. Unfortunately, after viewing the Left Behind  website and message boards, I don't think he's unusual for fans of these  books.  This series is targeted to fundamentalists whose theology and  politics are far to the Right of mainstream Evangelical Christians - there  is lot more of Bob Jones than Billy Graham in this series.  Fans seem to be  looking for some kind of validation and reinforcement for their belief  system. This stuff reads like bad self-published sludge.  Unless you think  of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as great men of God, I wouldn't  recommend this book.  Tragically, I think these books will ultimately drive  many away from faith.	2000-09-19

It's either the  greatest thing that's ever been written or a vile piece of trash that  threatens the progress of civilization itself.  Please, people.  This is a  mediocore book.  It's target audience is people who read middle-to-low brow  fare like Tom Clancy and John Grisham.  It definitely isn't aimed for the  same class of people who read C.S. Lewis, or even Stephen King.  There are  plenty of mediocore books out there, and plenty of people who prefer  breezy, hastily-written stuff to serious novels.  Left Behind is crap, but  if that's what a lot of people like, so be it.  I'm more disturbed at how  the authors have helped fuel the popularity of a wildly off-base  interpretation of the Bible.  Before anyone reads this stuff and thinks  that this is really how the world is going to end, I suggest you do some  real Bible study and see that things like the Pre-Trib Rapture are found  NOWHERE inside its pages.	2000-09-13

Chick to  convince me that there is NOT order, design, and purpose in the universe,  or to disregard a historical figure as daunting as Jesus Christ. (After  all, is Jack T. Chick or Bob Jones any flakier than the people in the  Philippines who nail themselves on crosses, the Hindus who hang themselves  from hooks in their backs, or the Catholics who travel to Fatima and think  their fillings turn gold?  On the whole, fundamentalist Protestants are  much more sane and rational than enthusiasts in other religions - if you  don't agree with me, ask yourself who you'd rather hang out with for a  day.) That said, I agree wholeheartedly with Tim's take on these books.   The storyline and most of the characters are serviceably written - I'll  even grant that they're better than a lot of the crap being written by  contract writers for major publishers.  But these books are more interested  in preaching than in story-telling.  I find it especially annoying that  Jenkins and LaHaye are so unswerveringly arrogant to state that their idea  of how the world will end is fact, not speculation.  These books peddle  John Nelson Darby's oddball interpretation of Revelation as the doctrinaire  TRUTH of how the apocalypse will occur.  The least they could have done is  point out in a preface that they are painting a highly speculative  portrait, and that many other valid interpretations exist, instead of  including a triumphalist quote from apocalyptic crackpot John Walvoord that  &quot;the main features of this book aren't fiction.&quot;<br />It should also  be noted that Tim LaHaye really has very little to do with these books; at  best, he should be mentioned in a &quot;special thanks&quot; section.   Jenkins and Tyndale publishers are deliberately misrepresenting the  authorshipof these books to sell more of them.	2000-09-12

I've read  about half of the first book, and I'm afraid that the only effects the  series will have is:<br />1.  Confirm in the minds of many anti-Christians  that all evangelicals are low-rent, unintellectual people who follow Pat  Robertson and his ilk; and 2.  Make the silly obsession with the  &quot;Rapture&quot; a priority in many churches again.  That idea was  finally starting to fade along with Hal Lindsey before these books came  along. True, other religions have silly sectarian groups - like the  Catholics and the Virgin Mary sightings.  But society is much less  forgiving of evangelical Christians than any other religious minority, and  I'm afraid these books will just provide more fodder for those who hate us.   (They actually sell offensive parodies of the Christian Fish in  stores...can you imagine anyone driving around with a bumper sticker making  fun of Jews or Catholics?  Anyone who did that would be pulled off the side  of the road and beaten to a pulp in less than half an hour.  But it's okay  to make fun of us, for some reason.)<br />The authors haven't even bothered to  do basic scientific research; in the opening pages they conjecture that  Russia will invade Israel to steal crop fertilizer - any research into  agricultural science will show that the Soviet Union has huge tracts of  unused farmland in the Ukraine!  Growing food is not Russia's problem.   After that, the writing just gets worse.  The Russians try to nuke Israel -  why would they do that, when they want to steal Israel's food?  It makes no  sense, and the whole battle of Gog and Magog is rendered in about 3  paragraphs where the authors wipe out the Russian air force with a hail  storm.  (Curiously, the authors don't seem to be aware that they are  putting the Battle of Armageddon at the START of the apocalypse, when the  Bible has this battle at the END.)  I'm a 30-year-old journalist myself,  and I found the characterization of Buck Williams - the star-writer of Time  magazine - to be trite and shallow.  Who names a character  &quot;Buck?&quot; Rayford Steele, the guilt-ridden flight pilot, is no  better.  The worst character by far is Hattie Durham, an idiot bimbo flight  attendant whose only crime seems to be that she's 27 years old and  attractive to middle age men.  She has no depth, and the way the authors  constantly bring her back just so they can ridicule her for being a silly,  hysterical bimbo started to irk me around page 100.  I'm hardly  pro-feminist, but the depictions of Hattie became too misogynistic and  mean-spirited to ignore.  I'm determined to get to the end, but it's  degenerating into boring tripe by the page.<br />On the plus side, this is THE  most politically incorrect best-seller ever written.  If you want a book  that's willing to call Judaism &quot;wrong,&quot; criticize bad (oops - I  mean, &quot;progressive&quot;) Catholics, slam the Vatican, depict women as  weaker than men, and so forth, then these books have a certain appeal.  For  more serious, thought-provoking fiction with a spiritual theme, I'd  recommend Stephen King's The Green Mile or The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.   They both made me think a lot more about God than this shlock ever will.	2000-09-12
