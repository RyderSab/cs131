Finally, we learn that \\"psychopath\\"  is \\"sociopath\\" now, among professionals.   And I liked that he reminds us that  the \\"perfect\\" person,  marriage, family, the \\"perfect\\" anything is  a fiction.  When someone is held out to be \\"perfect,\\" especially by their family, it can be horribly debilitating, to say the least.  It was also chilling to realize that there are emotional \\"vampires,\\" feeding off others' life blood so they can mimic being human.  Still - I've always had more faith in nature than nurture.  I believe Peterson was born with a predilection to be a sociopath...and to kill.   I've known and counseled people with far worse lives than Scott Peterson's - and they've gotten help and gone on to be good and caring.  The abused, the neglected, the \\"unloved,\\" who should be among the walking dead, but who've refused to let their pasts keep them from  finding and giving love - many have made life work for them wonderfully despite extreme deprivation. Some don't make it, I realize that.  I suppose Peterson is one of them.  But still - murder is the greatest taboo. You have to be pretty \\"bent\\" from the get-go to do it.	2005-10-13

Thanks to the great novelist, Jeffrey Archer, for enlightening me about some of the terrible (and yes, even humane) goings-on in a men's prison.  I'm not sure things are the same in American prisons...I have a feeling there's a bit more common courtesy afforded prisoners in Great Britain. Still - I learned a lot - and we need to learn about this hidden world.  We stash people away - many who don't deserve it, and certainly not the harsh sentences and conditions such as Archer himself was subjected to, for the  minor charge he was convicted of.  Whether guilty or not, he did not deserve to be sentenced to four years with hardened criminals and \\"lifers.\\"  I don't agree with the critics here who accuse him of egotism and grand-standing on his own behalf. I like him a lot, and can't wait to read his other books, now that I know the man. I think he's a very loveable, caring person, and has performed a great service with his \\"Prison Diary.\\"	2005-09-10

The only reason I gave this one two stars was because I did, in fact, finish it, but barely.  Lord,  he does go on.  And hasn't any writing professor at Amherst ever mentioned to him that a cliff-hanger a second is a second too many?  Frankly, I didn't give a rat's a--s about Sheila. Coben's female characters are fairly dull and one-dimensional compared to the men.  That's typical of male writers.  The only really good female character in the book COULD have been Will's mother, but she died, unfortunately, and all we have are a few piquant memories.  Anyway, the book was far too long for no reason. And the Ghost (so relentlessly, tediously grotesque you want  to say 'Oh, come off it!) , the airy-fairy lost brother - the FBI goons - it's all just one humongous, totally improbable stretch.  I finished it cause  I needed something to read while the library was closed, and I'm actually embarrassed to admit I didn't just put the darned thing down and go to a movie.	2005-07-28

One critic commented that such an abusive, dysfunctional childhood should not be presented humorously, but it's actually very healthy to do so.  Humor was how Burroughs survived. It makes him an outstanding role model for creative people from tortured backgrounds, proving you can, indeed, turn lemons into lemonade. As for all the people who comare him to David Sedaris: I find Burroughs to be a better writer.  He's willing to be darker, go deeper,  and be more of a risk-taker.  I  enjoy Sedaris, but \\"Scissors\\" leaves you feeling so much more than just pleasantly amused.  Also, the writing has a  naive, innocent quality.  For a book about  horrific, sophisticated issues, its style lifts it above the grim, the cynical and the glib.  I read \\"Dry,\\" too, and loved it , too. I hope to hear more from Augusten and I pray he's doing well.  He deserves all the yummies he once dreamed of as a boy.  I wish him lots of limousines.	2005-06-24

I am giving this book two stars because the author had to travel long distances and work very hard on what turned out to be extremely foolish projects that should never have appeared between the covers of a contemporary book.  Actually, I can't add much to what has been (excellently) reviewed here already.  I agree with just about every Amazon critic on this one.  I, too, enjoyed \\"Children of the Lie.\\"  I also happen to be a fan of \\"Hostage to the Devil\\" - it is far more enlightening and entertaining, and provided me, a writer of fiction, with a number of good \\"archetypes\\" of evil upon which to draw for inspiration.  If only certain acclaimed, best-selling writers would have a mechanism that cries out, \\"Somebody stop me!\\" there would be a lot fewer badly-written, self-important, quasi-religious, incompetent books like this one adding to the material glut on the planet.  I got this book at the library and found myself literally throwing it back into the return bin.  You know, what's bad about it mostly is that it screwed up people's lives, people who probably needed a whole different kind of treatment than the good \\"doctor-priest\\" or whatever he calls himself now, knew how to diagnose or give.	2005-05-29

This is one of them.  To expose to the world what her mother did; to face her own horror and shame because she cannot help loving - and loathing -  her own flesh and blood - this book is a great sacrifice for mankind.  The  writer has opened her veins to let us see evil as it exists in her own mother!  It is the ultimate truth-telling about what happened in Nazi concentration camps: the suffering, the vile participation in genocide by the German people; men - and, yes, women.  \\"Thank you!\\" to this author for the gift, difficult as it was to read - to witness  what she had to go through to get the truth - and that searing truth itself.	2005-03-13

Like many others, I've always been fascinated by the story of Eva Braun, but (maybe because I'm Jewish) was also afraid to really take a good look.  It's part of a horrifying story for a Jew, but I was drawn to this book specifically because it purported to be a \\"fictionalized\\" version of a (probably mostly) true story.  That kind of made it more neutral for me.  What I didn't expect was to come away with some sympathy for Eva; the author revealed aspects of her life with Hitler that show her to be something of a victim and a prisoner herself.  After all, once involved with this monster, she was not able to be free; she couldn't even leave her home alone, ever - she was always under guard.  And the author also brings up the fact that Hitler wouldn't marry her publicly...she was always described as his \\"friend\\" or his \\"secretary.\\"  In that time, in Europe, it was something of a disgrace to be a mistress, with no hope of marrying the man who had ruined your reputation.  So that Eva was placed in a humiliating position.  In  other words, this is as much a feminist novel as one about an evil society (which it also is; very, very subtly elaborated as the story unfolds). Another surprise was to find that I identified with Eva in some respects.  For example, the author describes her as a \\"fashion addict,\\" a shopaholic; all she ever thought about was what she would wear next.  And Eva would often change her clothing several times a day.  This vanity - this character defect  of  placing appearances above other values - is found among women everywhere, trained to use appearance to compete for men's attentions.  Eva is depicted as shallow and uninterested in anything other than being Hitler's lap dog.  This made her an object of scorn in the novel - but also a forgiveable, if weak, type of woman common to every culture.  I found myself unable to put the book down, and I admired the writing, which was, as one reviewer said, perfectly \\"creepy\\" - as if the storyteller were whispering a horror tale.  There are many insights about the times, the protagonists, including Hitler, Eva and Hitler's stooges.  As another reviewer has mentioned, one thinks about this book long after putting it down.	2005-03-13

It's an autobiographical fiction: true on both counts.  I believe Roth is a genius.  I've read or seen the films of just about everything he's written.  He makes me feel warm by addressing ideas that really matter and by bringing family stories alive.  Little Philip is a noble, caring child,  whose values stem from parents with commendable values.  They take risks ; never flinch from helping others in perilous or pitiable situations.  Of course, we also hear the other side of Philip's thinking; sometimes he is disgusted by the people he knows he must help, but this doesn't stop him.  I loved the way he puzzled over enigmas: people and situations he didn't - couldn't - possibly understand.  And this book shows us how wild his imagination was right from the start.  He was born to be a writer; to tell stories. His sentences: marvels of construction.  I love following them to their exhilerating conclusions.  Bravo, Mr. Roth.  You did it again!  I hope you're working on another marvelous book.  I'm just about to start reading \\"The Human Stain\\" - I can hardly wait!	2005-03-01

It's so wonderful when a writer can carry the 'tone' of a book throughout, without faltering.  Perrotta does this, seemingly effortlessly.  The tone here is witty, wry, light, charming, yet the subject matter is extremely serious.  A bunch of confused suburbanites with little children, many of the adults still 'children' themselves, find that suddenly there is a convicted child molester, perhaps even a child killer, in their midst.  What's so fabulous about this book is that, contrary to what one reviewer here wrote, the criminal is not the 'embodiment of evil' but is realistically portrayed as sad, confused, pathetic, cut off from simple human interactions \\"normal\\" people take for granted -  as much a victim of life's craziness as everyone else.  'Everyone else' includes Todd and Sarah, suddenly in love with each other instead of their incompatible spouses; Larry, a tantrum-throwing hothead hell-bent on driving the child molester from the neighborhood, the molester's poor old mother, forced to suffer the slings and arrows of her sanctimonious neighbors when she has done nothing more terrible than to care for her son - and other assorted very human people caught in the the stifling, cookie-cutter American suburbs and the young-parent trap.  For  the  thirty-somethings in the book, chafing at the bit, adult life has begun, but it is not a whole lot of fun.   One feels compassion for all the characters in this book,  thanks to an amazingly deft - and humane - writer.  What lifts this book above the common herd is the writer's understanding that we all have the basic need to be loved.  The gathering of his characters in the children's park, at the end of the novel, is a metaphor for this profound truth. <br />	2005-02-01

I listened to this book (audio tape) from Recorded Books, Inc. and it was exceptionally well read.  I enjoyed the follow-up, Morning Is A Long Time Coming as well.  Bette Green is a writer's writer (I'm a fiction writer, too).  Her work spans all ages.  In fact, I consider it unfortunate that, simply because her protagonist is a teenager, her books have been placed strictly in the young adult category.  It takes wisdom of life and knowledge of psychology to recognize that this is the story of an abused person.  Her life's choices and experiences often pertain to the severe abuse she suffered as a child, from physically and mentally cruel parents.  I know, because her parents might as well have been mine, although my physically cruel parent was my mother, whereas Patty's was her father, a raging, Hitler-like tyrant.  One wonders how this wonderful young person even survived, for her father was about as monstrous a parent as I've ever encountered in literature - or real life.  In some ways, however, her mother was worse - mocking, humiliating, goading, tormenting her daughter.  That was my fate, too, and it leads to many tragic symptoms, not the least of which are constant, tortuous self-doubt and the conflicting <br />traits of people-pleasing/provocative \\"truth\\"-telling.  I adored Patty, however, and loved her quest for love and self-acceptance.  That, too, mirrored my own.  Brilliant writing for all ages... I just wish there was another sequel that tells us what happens to Patty when/if she returns to the States. Does she marry Roger, the French photographer?  Does she finally, truly confront her rotten parents with what they have done to her/what they are?  Does she get a big inheritance from her grandparents so she can become the writer/journalist we believe she can be?  And I can't help wondering why she didn't tell Anton's father and sister that she had seen him?  She says that she didn't want to bring them any further stress, but wouldn't that have made them feel good, to know that, before his death, someone had truly loved and cared for him?  Oh, well. I will just have to imagine these things, and isn't that what's so marvelous about great literature?  It causes you to use your imagination!  Thanks, Bette Green, for a thought-provoking, empathic read.	2005-01-16

I would call his books melodramas, as opposed to thrillers.  They are passionate love/hate stories, with, yes, murder and mayhem, but they read like soap opera/potboilers.  The thing is, there are so many soap opera/potboilers that are as boring as...well...soap, and his aren't. I loved this particular tortured tale except for one thing: the character of Billy seemed a bit lacking.  He was too much \\"one-way,\\" too \\"good\\" and actually a little dim, not just as a character but in personality as well.  It's obviously a Cain and Able story (read: Cal and Bill).  And Dora, the mystery woman, is well fleshed-out (for a mystery woman).  But I couldn't care that much about Billy.  He just - well - bored me.  Also, the ending, while it came as something of a surprise, was something of a let-down.  My thought was, \\"And so the point of all this was.....?????\\"  Still, Cook is a masterful writer; vivid.

Mr. Auchincloss is a master wordsmith, an erudite, highly educated, celebrity auteur...we can hardly expect any different.  I started the book with high hopes, but as the reviewer below remarks: &quot;When was the last time you said 'plethora'?&quot;  <br />Actually, I DO use the word on occasion, probably because I am a writer, but I don't think I've heard it twice in my life from the lips of a lawyer or society matron.  And that was the rub for me in The Scarlet Letters: Mr. Auchincloss puts into the mouths of usually-dull people brilliant speechifying and allusions to rarified poetry.  He has the most unlikely, UN-educated dolts spouting impossible mouthfuls of ancient Greek verse and perfectly-pertinent quotes from a variety of literary figures - all this in the midst of a slight society soap opera.  I sense he wants to be our modern-day Galsworthy, but Galsworthy stopped short of being precious.   I find Mr. Auchincloss's writing and themes a tad contrived.  Also: the book morphs into several different relationships, different from the ones it started with, and not particularly interestingly related to the others.  The end is a de-flation. The 'hero,' having lunch with his mother-in-law, suddenly capitulates to all he has deemed unholy.  Why?  I suddenly found myself thinking, &quot;Who cares?&quot; and &quot;Well, at least it was short,&quot; and flinging the book aside with a tiny soupcon of resentment stemming from my feeling that I had been led on by &quot;good writing.&quot;<br />So - many of the paragraphs are exquisitely penned...but the whole is, on the whole, a Giant Yawn.

So if you have a chance to see the movie if it is repeated or comes out on DVD, I recommend it.  And I recommend the book wholeheartedly.

I guess I'd better go back and review the last couple of Robicheaux books, because I seem to have missed Bootsie's demise.  Not that I was a big a fan of hers.  She was just to perfectly cutesie (almost rhymes with Bootsie) to be a fully human woman.  Quiet, model-thin, always available for sex, morally incorruptible...every guy's Perfect Dream. Only a man would have written her.  However, I would like t know what happened so I can piece together the story lines.<br />Whatever.  It's another great one for the New Iberia superheroes...mopping up the street slop, popping tops, crushing  trash,  etc., etc.  It's the way people talk, but not the way they really are.    Often, the clean-up crew is a bunch of thugs who do NOT attend 12-step programs and who are far from witty and loveable.  But it's fun and there's poetic justice mixed with the poetry.  In a Dave Robicheaux novel you love to snicker at the bad guys, knowing they will surely meet Clete.	2004-03-09

Contrasting the lives of a smug, spoiled American couple living the good life and a struggling Mexican illegal and his wife just trying to stay alive, the book is very believable.  I am so tired lately of books that attempt to be dramatic and end up being implausible.  This book is different.  You really believe - you know - that Candido and his wife America are out there, homeless due to unforeseen circumstances that nearly sweep them away.  When self-deluded liberal and environmentalist Delaney Mosbacher hits and nearly kills Candido in his gorgeous Audi, as the Mexican tries to cross the California freeway on his way back to his camp in an arroyo with food for America, the stage is set for  Delaney's moral downfall.  As life falls apart for the Mexican couple, so Delaney's privileged world disintegrates as well, and the novel goes back and forth between the two families, until their unraveling lives finally collide in an ending that could only be described as biblical.  In fact, I found many ideas from  the Old and New Testament, as well as from mythology, in &quot;Curtain&quot; (and even literature, for in the beginning Candido in his travels north has been as naive as Voltaire's Candide).  It's a riveting book.  I couldn't wait to get back to it, and was disappointed when it ended.  I wanted to know what happened to the protagonists.  But it has  a fitting ending, in which the meek inherit the Earth, in a manner of speaking.  The novel tells us that we cannot escape the misfortunes of others, whether it's homeless immigrants in our backyard or distant war casualties...Read this great book - it's a literary thrill.	2004-03-02

I found it very crisp and it never waivered in its intensity, although it had amusing and delicious moments of yuppy socializing and two fantastic heroes:<BR>Colquitt and Walter Kennedy, who refused, by the end, to allow the horrors next door to continue.  Yes, they had to perform a drastic deed to end the tyranny of the architectural monster-house, but no one can say they were wrong to do it.  There is a major question left for the reader to ponder at the end of the novel...I won't spill it here, and spoil the book for the lucky readers to come...  I say &quot;lucky,&quot; because this is definitely a 'treat' book that will keep you up all night and turning the pages frantically.  And I have to say I miss Col and Walter and Razz and Foster Grant. House is also a charming love story.  It's about good, popular people who love each other unconditionally... In fact, I think it is one of the few suspense novels that portrays a truly loving couple, for Col and Walter never fall out of love with each other, no matter what horrible things happen around - or to - them.	2004-02-02

I was surprised at how beautifully this book treated the relationship between humans and dogs.  Again, as another reviewer has said, why must an author avoid an unpleasant subject matter, such as animal abuse?  Does that mean that no books should be written about child abuse or the Holocaust, for example?  Anyway, the only thing &quot;missing&quot; from the novel was an examination of Lexy's past.  I thought that was strange.  But it was simply a presentation of a mentally disturbed person's symptoms, no explanations, and perhaps that is all right, after all.  I felt so sad as I read the novel; it was almost like listening to sensitive classical  music that is perfectly tuned to make us feel sorrow.  And I also appreciated the writer's ability to turn the prose chilly, and frighten the reader, in the scenes with the animal abusers.  There were moments when you condemned Lexy, and Paul, too, but by the end you were sympathetic to all the characters.  They got under your skin - and that includes Lorelei, the dog.  Wonderful book, cudos to the gifted author.	2004-02-02

Lush, vivid, rushing forward and pulling you with it...you cannot put this melodrama down.  I give it five stars for sheer entertainment.<br />PFG: the characters.  Siddons is a great psychological writer.  She gives individualistic sketches of several characters that could be textbook, especially the screamingly psychotic sociopath Ruth Yancey-Fox.  Yikes.  <br />PFG: the first several chapters, describing the Yancey family.<BR>It's as perfect as novel-writing can be right up until Ruth is adopted into the Fox family.  Then it gets &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;-y and &quot;Little Foxes&quot;-y.  It continues to mesmerize, but is never as good as those first chapters.<br />V.V.: Descriptions of good ol' black folks who still like to dance on the old plantation 'cause they's devoted to their massahs - ugh.  Demeaning, stereotypical, crap.  Made me want to throw up.  <br />V.V.: Rip, the black woman who &quot;knows&quot; the sickie Ruth almost in the biblical sense: we are set up to believe that she has some magical powers to &quot;protect&quot; Ruth's offspring, but in fact she never does do a damn thing to help them.  She's always &quot;lookin' out&quot; for her &quot;chirren,&quot; but I found that she was basically in collusion with Ruth.  It's like the old saying: &quot;If you're not part of the solution then you're part of the problem.&quot;  She watched Ruth do horrible things, including murder, and never said a word.  Her rationalization, at the end, that &quot;Who would believe me?&quot; just didn't cut it.  She had power in that household, too.  Even if they didn't believe her, she should have had the guts to spill to beans...or the chitlins, or whatever.<br />V.V.: Tying up the whole thing in letters from Ruth at the end was a highly unbelievable contrivance.  But by then you were just happy to have the fascinating story end.  As good as it is, it gets on your nerves after a while.  I found Nell, the final heroine, to be a milksop.But in the end, too, it's a good sister story.  If you've ever had a female sibling rival and made up when you found out how sick the grownups were, you'll probably love it.<br />PFG: Painterly descriptions.<br />V.V.: Location, Location, Location.  The South doesn't get more nauseating than this.	2004-01-12

I am so sick and tired of the same old same old in these books.  I guess the word is CONTRIVED.  When writing becomes contrived, the art of writing goes out the window.

I'm slogging through it, hoping to find another book soon that I will enjoy more.  Maybe it's the &quot;Canadian thing.&quot;  The characters never really sparkle; they are a bit too shlumpy for me, and the writing (and some of the characters' pecadillos) seem contrived, like Atwood threw them in to &quot;flavor&quot; the book - but who cares?  It's a little like a stew that looks good, should be good, but has some flavors that are just 'wrong.'  And the reviewers here are correct: who in the heck is Zenia and why should we care about what she did to these rather self-centered ho-hum women?  One reviewer was so right on about the stereotyping of these women.  I want really rock-solid individuals in a novel.  Nothing seems terribly important.  The descriptions of Roz's twins and her son and his girlfriend actually do (unlike what one reviewer said) border on the sentimental.  Too cutesy, their puppy-dog-like behaviors or, in the case of her son Larry, rather limp ones and his stereotypical girlfriends to boot - left a taste in my mouth, of an artifically-sweetened pastry.  I have read three Atwood novels now and just don't care for them particularly.  Yes, the writing is great - it's great, contrived writing.  I'm always so aware of it - too aware.  It's a self-conscious &quot;good writing&quot; style.  But many people love her, so don't go by me.  You'll probably love it.	2003-12-26

He has had a tremendous influence on my life and my own writing.  He has motivated me to write stories that have what I would call metaphysical 'weight.'  This novel is a great tragedy, and, yes, sad, but with his other books comes humor, too - a wry look at  well-defined characters.  The man is a metaphorical magician, I might add.  Reading him is like riding the scales with a great opera star.  Read everything by this stand-out writer.  You can't go wrong.	2003-12-18

Yes, her writing leads you on.  You keep hoping the next sentences will actually lead to something important in the plot or character development.  Ho-hum.

I'm re-reading this book that thrilled me years ago and thrills me today.  Now, however, I realize just how &quot;modern&quot; it is, even more so than the works of Dickens, whom I also revere, but whose writing had a quaint quality that actually makes him the lesser artist, in my opinion.  Hardy's writing is spare but nothing is left out.  You feel it, you taste it, you live it.  It has the firm, sure quality of a minimalist work of art, and yet the twists and turns of its plot are dizzying.  I detect its influence on novelist Toni Morrison, I might add.  I'd be willing to bet she's a Hardy scholar.  I read many passages, many scenes, that reminded me of her &quot;folksy&quot; conceits.  And I was amazed at Hardy's contemporary understanding of addiction, in this case alcoholism.  In fact, Henchard is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot;  He abstains from liquor for 21 years, but his character defects and lack of spiritual awareness catapault him right back into his disease when he begins drinking again.  In fact, his life spirals out of control faster and faster with his first return to drink, showing that alcoholism, like all addictions, is a progressive disease.  A reviewer here said the book was depressing, and that Hardy is dark.  However, the &quot;light&quot; in Hardy comes with his wisdom, not unlike Faulkner's, of human nature.  There are so  many themes of the enduring truths  that one is uplifted just by the reading. Sometimes I mourn for the writers I will never meet, the ones who have passed on.  Their teaching is so important to my own spiritual and artistic growth, that I have experienced a great love from them and for them.  Hardy is one of those for me.  Wherever he dwells now, I send him my appreciation.	2003-12-09

Love this author, but Heart Full just doesn't cut the mustard.  There is little of the fascinating prose that informed The Stranger Beside Me, Small Sacrifices or Never Let Her Go, my personal faves.  Still, you have to hand it to Ann.  She's gutsy for simply standing up for people who can no longer stand up for themselves.  Liysa Northon is, by anyone's standards, a sociopathic killer.  I have read her father's letter here, and I am very sorry that he feels he must defend her, but Dad, here's the bald truth: NEVER ONCE DID YOUR DAUGHTER EXPRESS REMORSE FOR WHAT SHE DID.  There's the true meaning of a sociopath: one who has no remorse.  Normal people feel badly even when they kill someone in self-defense.  That's because normal people are not  &quot;geared&quot; to kill.  For them it is a horrible trauma, one that haunts them even when they have to do it, in battle or as a battered spouse.  Liysa Northon is a hystrionic, self-centered narcissistic who has victimized scores of people by what she did.  It is obvious that she was looking for a way to &quot;explain&quot; her premeditated crime.  And from what others have said of her here, she has littered the landscape with broken hearts and spirits.  And she killed a very good man. I hope she rots in prison, and my heart goes out to Chris Northon's parents especially.  It's just such a waste what happened to their son.  What I don't understand is how such a vile human being got away with so little prison time.  Frankly, I think she deserves life without parole.  After all, she shot Chris in cold blood - premeditated - I know I'm repeating myself, but I am just in shock over the miscarriage of the justice system in this case.  And yet, Ann could have written this one better.  I guess she is just pooped - but does that mean her editors can't help her out a little?  Very little juice to this writing....sorry, Ann...but I will say this: as a writer myself, I wouldn't dream of allowing such lackluster work into print.	2003-12-02

The reader is the incomparable Richard Poe, whose voice is like hot fudge over Hagendaas ice cream. The writing is sublime, the reader is divine; what more could one ask for?  Except....this book sounds like, reads like,  A CLONE OF RICHARD FORD'S (another Pulitzer recipient) \\"INDEPENDENCE DAY\\" as read, yes, by Richard Poe (for Recorded Books, Inc.).  Hello!  I mean, it's as if Smiley read Ford's book and just decided to keep it going...real estate, sex, family stuff, and funny riffs on the \\"wisdom\\" of the real estate world and the amusing, sometimes irritating, sometimes adorable people who...people it.  Maybe these two literary stars wrote their books in complete vacuums.  Obviously, they must have.  But \\"Faith\\" is like Ford's Book continued.  Even descriptions of characters are very similar, as well as names.  And believe me, I don't have a problem with that.  What a blast, getting to listen to a slightly different take on my first favorite book.  Ford's is more compassionate, humane, loving.  His character Frank Bascomb is one of the dearest characters in all of literature, and as a writer I was hugely inspired by his writing.  I think the world of Smiley, too, but this is an incredible coincidence.  Did reading \\"Independence Day\\" make her rush to her computer, as I did?  I know there was a temptation for me to write like Richard Ford...but I resisted it and thank goodness the book I was writing is my very own, for better or worse.  Still, it got me going, as great lit often does.   Anyway, I just thought I'd put it out there and see if anyone else had the same reaction to \\"Good Faith.\\"  I haven't finished the book, so I'll write a more thorough review when I'm finished, and perhaps my take on it will change somewhat.  But darn, if this doesn't sound like ACT TWO of  \\"Independence Day.\\"	2003-11-14

My God, can this person be making money from her enterprise?  Yes, and lots of it.  Because there are many word-challenged dummies who think that \\"Wow!\\" and \\"Oh, no!\\" and \\"Hi!\\" are the stuff of great  writing. She has millions of boring minions.  That, of course, is the reason we are forced to countenance her, smiling from ear-to-ear, in her white linen suit, gold jewelry and air-brushed, plastic face, posed in front of her large Victorian manse, on the front of every literary  magazine (though you will never, of course, find her reviewed there).  And that is why her junior-version daughter can also be found in those same Pepto Bismol-colored ads, where she and her MOM, like the novelist in \\"Loves and Lives of a She-Devil,\\" are of one mind, which is to litter the sterile waiting rooms of dentists and plastic surgeons with their sterile stories.  \\"She-Devil\\" is one of my favorite novels, I might add.  Skip this crap and go directly to real literature, if you have any sense at all.  Meanwhile, pass the Imodium.	2003-10-05

This novel interested me because I am both a writer<BR>and a visual artist and of course the book was written by the<BR>former and about the latter...the elements of childhood that have shaped her.  I enjoyed it but...I gave it four stars because its &quot;shadow&quot;-protagonist - a childhood chum of the main protagonist, the artist, remains just that throughout the book - a shadow.  Now, this could be effective under certain circumstances, but Cordelia is so important...she keeps popping up in the artist's consciousness as a particularly important fixture in her early life....but I don't really get a true &quot;sense&quot; of her.  Even when the author meets her later in life under strange and tragic circumstances...and her constant searching for Cordelia in ever stranger and on every corner...the character of this...character....doesn't gel.  So a major conceit of the book was lacking for me, and I grew weary of it.  I wanted to know SOMETHING more substantial about Cordelia, but never felt I really did.  Other characters - childhood friends, the artist's parents and brother...were wonderfully drawn.  Also the mother of a friend...a hateful, religious bigot who becomes the vengeful centerpiece of the artist's work, are deliciously drawn.

It doesn't have the heart that<BR>Frank's books do, especially Angela's Ashes, but it's a very endearing bit of storytelling - lots of storytelling - and he really knocked me on my arse with some of the scenes, especially the gold-smuggling in India and the romp with the German countess in Ibizia.  <br />Anyone who can make me laugh like that gets my gratitude, all the way.  He's a wordsmith - a real poet who obviously loves to play with language, which is so endearing to me as a writer myself.  And he knew lots of interesting people, including Richard Harris and Robert Mitchum.  Also, he speaks of a NYC in the fifties that 's added to my sense of the town's history.<br />I did notice, however, that his description of his father, who abandoned him and was a drunken sot his whole life, could describe the author as well.  Malachy, however, really does<BR>seem to love his children,  and with the mention of one AA meeting may be trying to tell us he's a recovering drunk.   I hope so.<br />If so, this book is like a Fourth Step, because it's a straight, dry-eyed look at the many mean, stupid and irrational things he did to himself and others for  the years he was, literally and figuratively, drinking himself under the table.

I loved this book, especially the scenes between Hannah and her grandmother.  They reminded me so much of my relationship with my Jewish grandmother...a little spicey but with a foundation of unconditional love that made any \\"sour\\" notes sweet.<br />I also identified with Hannah's relationship with Celia, her aloof mother, because I had a mother like that.  My mother \\"disowned\\"  me at a younger age, but I think it would be devastating at any age.  <br />This book reminded me of  The Red Tent, in a way...it had that womanly flavor; a juicy book about the strength, character and individuality of women, without completely excluding interesting men.<br />Katie Singer is a remarkable writer...this is a real page-turner, and I learned a lot...about Jewishness, about the Yiddish language (which I grew up with but which I never actually learned myself, so it was good to have some renewed lessons) and about the wholeness of a broken heart.

Casting directors, hear this:	\\"Up Country\\" is the perfect vehicle for that long-awaited<BR>movie duo, Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart.  These two would be perfect for the roles of Paul and Susan.  Also, Ford and Naomi Watts, for Susan is a true chameleon, and Watts's performance in \\"Mullholland Drive\\" qualifies her for the role of the debutante-CIA sidekick for the older Paul Brenner.<br />Thanks to the author for giving us a fascinating, informative bird's-eye view of Vietnam during the war and Vietnam now.  This novel has so many facets: it's a whodunnit, a thriller, a romance, a historical overview and a travelogue.  <br />While Brenner's sarcasm becomes a bit tiresome at times, it fits the world-weary,Vietnam pothead era-persona of the main character.  Man, it's just gotta be Harrison Ford...not Travolta, not Bruce Willis, please....just Ford.  I'd be the first in line for tickets.	2003-04-03

Co-dependency is definitely Ray Mitchell's main addiction.  He's an approval junkie.  And he almost dies for his addiction, because \\"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\\"<br />This is a fascinating mystery story, and kept me turning the pages fast, wishing, as one reviewer here put it, that I could slow down.  But I couldn't. I just had to find out which one of those people Ray had to please who consitituted his personal Waterloo.<br />The characters were rich, unique and well-formed, <BR>especially Nerese, the detective, and the children - his daughter Ruby, the kids from the projects.<br />And also: as a writer, I saw the theme of wanting - needing - to make someone else's life your own; to get into it, understand it, possibly even heal it by writing about it.  There's a lot of hubris in that need.   I'm currently writing a novel based on a tragic life, and sometimes I feel so good about what I hope to do - to find the answer to \\"Why?\\"  But when I read this book I identified with  Ray...I mean, is my need to heal through literary revelation simply a weakness? Is another's sad problem really any of my business? If the people associated with this character - his family, his friends - read my story - they may not thank me for it.  And some of them, like Ray's batterer - might be angry about it. And yet, like Ray, I feel compelled to keep doing this work.  If it wasn't so hard to make myself do it at times (writing is definitely not the \\"softer, easier way\\")  I'd think it might be an addiction.<br />Price is a fantastic writer.  Hope to read his other novels now.	2003-03-29

On occasion, I have been forced to listen to his books on tape from the library because everything else was out.  Most of his books start out with a decent story and end in a dizzy, uninteresting chase that is all too obvious and makes me want to throw the darned thing against a wall...rarely can I finish one of his so-called \\"books.\\" The last one, about the woman detective with the rare blood disease and the serial killer who murdered newlyweds was one such example.  Loved the premise, thought it had promise when it started, then - wham - the secret of who the killer was was given out to soon, the inevitable chase, the improbable \\"unmasking\\" of the maybe-not-killer.  Ho-hum.  Dumb.<br />So - bear with me - when I picked up the tape of Beach House I was ready for the let-down of yet another Patterson re-run.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that the story, though ridiculously implausible at the end, as well, was much better written than most of his books, and had an endearing cast of characters.  In fact, this book DOES NOT SOUND LIKE PATTERSON AT ALL, BUT ANOTHER, MUCH BETTER MYSTERY WRITER!  For one thing, there are several mysteries threading throughout, and well-paced, to keep you wanting to keep reading from the halfway mark...UNLIKE THE USUAL PATTERSON. <br />All I can think of is that Peter De Jonge is the reason.  Perhaps he will write a book under his own name one of these days.  I am certain he's behind the improvement of a Patterson (lord, I can barely bare to say the word, because it defiles the genre I so love,  okay, I'll put it in quotes)...\\"novel.\\"	2003-03-08

I wanted to say, again and again - \\"A woman wouldn't say...do...that.\\"  <br />It's really a gay book about gay men, I think.  Even the gay women are more like gay men.  <br />The movie's better.  I recommend it, except for Nicole Kidman's ridiculously bulbous, clown-like nose.  Virginia Woolf had a lovely, noble Roman nose.  HEL-LO, HOLLYWOOD!<br />The book is an attempt to copy Mrs. Dalloway, a brilliant, light-filled, organic work of art.  This is a contrivance.<br />Still, it is obviously inspired.  And it's made a splash. But the book underwhelmed me, unlike my reading of the real Mrs. Dalloway, which I adored.<br />By the way, the best section is about Mrs. Brown...I wished the whole book was about her.	2003-03-03

I enjoy Bebe Moore Campbell because she examines the ambivalence, not only in friendships between blacks and whites, but in individual black and white people regarding their racial identities.  And she comes at these subjects from all directions: love, friendship, work, current social and political crises.  I also read &quot;What You Owe Me&quot; and found it to be fascinating as well, and hard to put down once the ball gets rolling.  &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot; is a juicy soap opera and cocktail - a true mix of  varying characters examined from without AND within.  However, sometimes the writing fell down - phrases and ideas were blatantly repeated, and now and then a sentence or word just sort of hung there, as if it didn't belong.  Also - in this book the author tied things up a bit too neatly, and suddenly, at the end, as if she knew she could only write so much that would be published...and she was probably right.<br />Still - I would highly recommend this book for an understanding of racial interactions between Brothers and Sisters.	2003-01-20
US	37236260	RBZIPBCI13FDC	0743211375	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Loved it!  Why's everybody whining?	&quot;Buick&quot; is a wonderful book, and confirms my theory that<BR>Stephen King was abducted by aliens as a child or young person.  And that is not a joke.  I think he's been writing this experience out of his system for years, and continues to this day.  Where he comes from...upper New England...was the scene of many reported abductions from the forties to the seventies.  <br />It is my contention that &quot;Salem's Lot,&quot; King's first (and some believe) greatest novel, was situated in Salem, New Hampshire, the site of the &quot;American Stonhenge,&quot; where abductions were said to proliferate back in the fifties and sixties, and the home of Betty and Barney Hill - the first &quot;famous&quot; abductees. <br />I had the privilege of &quot;reading&quot; this book by listening to the Simon &amp; Schuster audio version of it, with a variety of well-known actor-readers, and it came across as &quot;pure&quot; King to me: a homespun tale about state troopers in a rural, slightly out-of-time place, everyday heroes thrown into something way beyond their ken, and yet responding to that &quot;something&quot; with heroism and humor.  Folksy catch-phrases abound, along with stomach-roiling descriptions of E.T.'s emerging from a strange contraption.  It's got enough anecdotal trooper/highway escapades to keep the average reader engaged.<br />Hey, I loved it.  I was just glad it didn't  end up like &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; or &quot;The Regulators,&quot; books that sound like King started them (to get you roped in) but were finished by some kid who plays a lot of video games.  Many of King's latest books have bogged down into  &quot;a boy thing.&quot;  I get so far with them, then grumble and leave them in the laundromat for some...boy.<br />In any case, I was pleased that I wanted to go all the way with the Buick.  Felt like I got my King back again.  And no, I don't think he should retire, but I do think he deserves it.	2003-01-20

This is a well-written, thoughtful piece of research.  I just<BR>started reading it and it's very, very paintful in places...but it sparked something different from what most reviewers here have written.<br />I had a MOTHER who was a GIRL BULLY.  Although I have struggled with this for years (I'm 58) just reading the introduction and the first chapter of this book made me gasp with the realization that my mother treated me the way these mean girls treat each other - and her personality profile fits perfectly!  Interestingly, I only had one or two incidents of girl bullying in school (in one, it was physical, and I vanquished the girl bully who was the leader of the pack in 6th grade - she tried to bait me into a physical fight and I, a much smaller girl, won!  I did have to to endure the ignominy of \\"respect\\" that year - it's cold and lonely being \\"respected\\" - but I moved on to junior high soon enough with the sef-respect that I could take care of myself).<br />HOWEVER - at home I was mercilessly bullied by my \\"sweet,\\" \\"kind,\\" \\"caring\\" mother - who had everyone fooled - even my father, who was my nurturer, and my loving grandparents, who adored my mother and wanted her good opinion.  So no grownups ever rocked the boat - just like the teachers who can't believe such nice, sweet girls are capable of being bullies.<br />My mother was covert.  She never reported my \\"wrongdoings\\" to my father.  She simply put me down, called me hideous names, hit me on the back, ridiculed my sexuality by poking me and calling me a \\"cow\\" when I began to sprout breasts, told me people spoke about me behind my back, pulled my hair (terrifying), and once beat me over the head with an iron broom when I borrowed some money from a school friend and needed her to help me pay it back.<br />And yet, as I've mentioned - my mother was Miss Popularity.  Always had been.  She was voted Most Popular in high school and had a bevy of friends from earlier days who still adored her.  They were the \\"popular girls,\\" too - but luckily for me, they were not bullies.  They continued to love my mother and I, in turn, received great nurturing and love from this \\"Yah Yah Sisterhood.\\"  <br />Later in life, when I tried to tell them about my mother's cruelty, it was nearly impossible for them to imagine it... for<BR>anyone to imagine it.  She - who loved their children so, who adored babies and kittens and was not at all self-serving...how could such a sweet, popular girl be such a vile abuser?  <br />Well, I was her target - her only target, her only daughter, the only \\"girl\\" close enough for her to abuse...and she knew, because  I, too, wanted her love and approval - that I would never tell.  At least, not as a child.  <br />It's sad, because for years I was enraged at my mother, my father, my grandparents and the other wonderful people who loved me (more than my mother but who did nothing to stop her sneaky, evil way of treating me).  Then I realized that it was her - just her - and I forgave her.  And I told all the others something that made them think: \\"You treated me better than my own mother did.\\"  This was long after my mother died, at age 49 - a very young age to die, and a very disappointed woman, though even this the others didn't see.  They simply thought her rather saintly and resigned.<br />So - this \\"girl bully\\" thing can extend to all areas of behavior.<BR>It can happen in families as well as with pals and schoolmates.  I thank the author of \\"Odd Girl Out\\" for confirming for me what I knew, deep down, about my mother, but hadn't quite named as of this point.  She wasn't just abusive - my mother was a bully...a \\"girl\\" bully - covert, sneaky, self-amused, cruel, petty, sadistic.  It's happening to you, but nobody believes it - not even you.	2003-01-02

I have just re-read GWTW for the fourth time and each time<br />I do I start out thinking it a magnificently written and researched book, with a glorious story - and the patronizing racist attitude of the author - yes, the author herself - makes me sick to my stomach.<br />I devoured this novel when I was thirteen, again  in my twenties, then my thirties, and here I am again,  keen to know what will happen next to that sociopath Scarlett O'Hara  the ultimate sexy, manly man, Rhett Butler and the dreamy dreamer and weakling, Ashley Wilkes.<br />And yet - I believe this book should be banned.  There are almost no books I feel that way about.  I'm a writer and I abhor censorship.  But this book is so outright racist it gags.<br />Why should such stereotypes be allowed to continue for generation after generation to absorb?<br />What would the world think of a romantic novel about dashing German SS officers and a beautiful blonde \\"maidchen\\" cavorting charmingly before concentration camp slaves? All the while talking about those slaves as if they were simply \\"children\\" who didn't know any better than to be wearing striped pajamas, carrying out humiliating tasks for their \\"masters\\" and existing pleasantly and contentedly in their cute little  \\"barracks\\"?  Critics would be up in arms.  Such a novel would fall into disrepute and no one would claim it to be a great work of literature, even if it was well-written.  So why do we stand for  GWTW - this travesty of lies, lies, lies?<br />I notice that one of the reviewers below mentioned that slaves weren't, in fact, badly treated.  Hello!  To begin with, slavery is slavery: an abomination  upon the Earth.  Any person who is enslaved is being treated badly.  Period.  Second, that reviewer should read Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved\\"<br />to find out what it was REALLY like to live as a slave on a southern plantation.  That depiction  rings true.  GWTW, on the subject of slavery, is complete clap-trap.<br />Over and over again, it is mentioned that Scarlett's  mother, \\"Miss Ellen,\\" would be \\"turning over in her grave\\" to see how<br />Scarlett betrayed her southern belle roots.  Well, I contend that Margaret Mitchell is turning over in her grave because she knows what a monstrous mistake she made with GWTW.  Hopefully, she's evolved, and, knowing her feminist views and her basic fairness as a person, I think she would agree with me - BAN THIS BOOK!	2002-12-23

I'm one of those people who dislikes re-reading books, or seeing a movie more than once.  I'm a novelist myself (unpublished, but hopeful), and I like to gulp as much fiction and media as I can, but  rarely go back over old ground.  <br />The only movie I watch over and over is the Coen Brothers' \\"Miller's Crossing\\" and the only books I seem able to re-read are those by Mary McGarry Morris.<br />For one thing, each time I re-visit one of her novels, I find there are new layers of meaning I missed the first, and even the second time.  For example, the first time I read Fiona Range, I, like some of the others who have reviewed it here, found it to be less tragic and moving than her other books, \\"A Dangerous  Woman,\\" \\"Vanished\\" (my  favorite; it should have won the Pulitzer) and \\"Songs In Ordinary Time.\\"<br />However, I am currently re-reading it now and, contrary to what I thought was going to happen (I knew the ending, so how could it be surprising and interesting?) it has turned out to be even better BECAUSE I know the ending.  Now it truly does seem tragic,  a magnificent character study of a Woman Interrupted...a woman whose whole life revolves around the black hole of lost identity, a giant lie perpetuated by those who pretend to have cared for her.  <br />It's a about monstrous hypocrisy and what  happens to people when they are kept from essential knowledge about themselves.  It's about cruelty that drives people to self-destruct.  Damn, it's good.<br />After Faulkner and Joyce, Mary McGarry Morris has had the most significant effect on my  writing.  Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Ford, Russell Barnes (\\"Affliction\\"), Alice McDermott, Annie Prioux, Stephen King, Toni Morrison...they are all to be studied, and I owe them so much.  But Mary is the greatest writer in America today.  As another reviewer here noted, her characters are fresh, real, surprising, devoid of stereotype, human to the bone. No one writes them living and breathing as she does. <br />With their many flaws and their  heartaches, their jerkiness, their addictions, their violence and their cuteness, they are truly unforgettable. The old expression, \\"To know her, is to love her,\\" is what makes these books keepers.  Thanks, Mary, for the gifts.	2002-12-01

Another quote from the book:<br />&quot;Fall back on your cliches.&quot;<br />Both of these quotes aptly describe this latest Lucas Davenport so-called detective novel.  I have read them all.<BR>The first few (common to the publishing world) were great.<BR>Then the guy got popular and his publishers stopped edtiting him.  <br />Do not read this book if you care Whodunnit.  The killer is sprung on us at the end of the book - and it's nobody you<BR>would have thought -  or cared - about.  The killer suddenly<br />appears out of nowhere, with no history except what the author fills in quickly...like he didn't have a satisfactory villain and had to come up with one suddenly.  <br />However, do read this book if you like to hang around with the most boring bunch of law enforcement officials in the world.  Well, I guess you can't expect too much from Minneapolis.  The favorite expressions of Davenport and his gang are: &quot;Cheez,&quot; &quot;Oh, man&quot; and &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />One of the most irritating things about the book is that everybody sounds alike - maybe that's what it's like in<BR>Minneapolis, after all.  But as a woman, I know a female journalist doesn't say to a detective she barely knows, &quot;Am I gonna haveta blow you to do this?&quot;<br />I have a headache from ploughing through this piece of you-know-what.  I will never read another of this man's books again.  He just does it for the money now, take my word for it.<br />One piece of advice: Keep it simple, Sandford.

I read \\"Running From the Law\\" a couple of years ago and loved it...actually, I listened to it on a Recorded Books, Inc. tape read by the fantastic reader Barbara Rosenblat, a true audio \\"star.\\"  I thought the style amusing and unique, and the whole idea and the way it was put together brilliantly creative.<br />I have tried to like other work by the author, but have been disappointed with each subsequent  book.  It reminds me of Julie Smith's fabulous debut, \\"New Orleans Mourning,\\" and her feminist heroine Skip Langdon...loved that one, too, but the books that followed just didn't live up to the promise of the first.  It's as if the poor author is forced into writing the same kind of story, with the same gimmicky style, again and again, because the first was a smash hit.  In the case of Scottoline and Smith, it hasn't worked.<br />I kept wishing this book would end.  That's not a good thing.  I found Anne's thought promises annoying...to begin with, Scottoline has put Mary and Benny's style into Anne's mouth.  Anne is a young, California woman...the cutesy \\"tough girl\\" thoughts...even down to the Blahniks...just didn't ring true.  Only street-smart easterners think and speak as Anne does in this book. <br />I just kept saying, over and over to  myself...Implausible...implausible...<br />The good things about the book were the author's sensitivity about a major feminist issue: women being threatened by and  competitive with beautiful women; and the scene in which Mary's mother tells Anne that she has been cursed by an \\"evil eye.\\"  This was almost a tad too sentimental, the whole scene, but it was warm and cute, and well-drawn.<br />But I have to admit - I won't be reading or listening to Lisa Scottoline again, unless she writes a different kind of book.	2002-10-26

Navarro\\" every time you use it. The readers get it. \\"L.Q.\\" will suffice after the second round.<br />2. \\"Sure\\" isn't an interesting word. It makes the speaker sound dull. I think one reviewer here used the word \\"tedious\\" to describe Billy Bob Holland (whose name in-sures tedium, I might add).<br />3. Alert your editors to the fact that you will possbily be over-using expressions like \\"baby fat on her upper arms\\" \\"a mouth like a flower,\\" \\"purple garters on his upper arms\\" and \\"lantern-jawed.\\" Ask them to edit you more rigorously so the reader does not have to suffer this, er, tedious - repetition.<br />4. If you are going to go in a new direction with your writing, how about something really new? As Moseley did with his Socrates series. Right now, the Texas Ranger thing is just Bad Robicheaux. <br />5. Robicheaux is rippin'. But we know that artists need to change...again...change to something that is better, not duller. <br />6. Someone mentioned that the poetry makes up for the dull prose. No, it doesn't. In fact, the dull prose makes the poetry sound cornball. Icky. Billy Bob gives no indication from his personality that he is in any way a poetic man. He's like James Garner on a \\"cute\\" day. You love to watch him perform, but if he should start spouting deep wisdom and poetry you'd groan and shout \\"Shaddup, stupid!\\"<br />7. Leave Texas rangers to Mr. Lonesome Dove. Now THERE'S a buncha rangers!<br />8.  Avoid speechifying, preaching and endless purple prose at all costs!  Some parts of this novel are like a musical in which the characters burst into sentimental song and you want to cover your ears and say, \\"Not now!\\"  It's not that poetic prose doesn't have its place.   The Robicheaux novels are wonderful because of this feature.  However, that was \\"loose\\" writing.  This is not.  It's aw shucks gee golly writing, interspersed with purple prose.  <br /> I know I'm repeating myself, but please - give us something truly unique, Mr. Burke. You can do it!...	2002-10-03

I<BR>wanted to stay in the dead girl's Heaven with her and learn more about what she saw and her observations about her sad family, friends and killer.<br />This is a very  naturalistic style of writing.  It's so good you almost don't &quot;notice&quot; the style...it's...organic, I guess you could call it.<br />Unlike other reviewers, I loved the ending, and found tears rolling down my face as the final words were uttered. I hadn't realized how touched I was until the dead girl let us go with a sweet, simple and kindly farewell. This book is a  joy and will probably become a classic.	2002-09-25

When I read \\"The Friends of Eddy Coyle\\" years ago, it had a huge impact on my writing...I thought it was one of the most exciting books I'd read in years.  Being from Boston, too, I was thrilled, because so few novels coming out of my town really capture its gritty quality...and the dialogue...primo!!!<BR>The I read \\"The Verdict\\" and saw the movie...wow.  <br />And then I wandered away and didn't read anything else by George V. Higgins for years.  I just picked up the Recorded Books, Inc. book on tape of \\"Sandra Nichols\\" at the library, as read by the incomparable George Guidall and I was blown away by how great Higgins is with characterization and dialogue.  I note that a previous reviewer found the book too \\"talky,\\" but I am a reader who LOVES dialogue...good dialogue...it's so rare.  I could riff on GVH's characters ad infinitum.  <br />For all those writers who need a lesson in writing great dialogue, and readers who adore fun, juicy, quirky characters, and for all those literary people who believe that CHARACTER IS FATE, then this novel is for you.  <br />Thank you, again, Mr. Higgins, for being there.	2002-09-01

True crime with great literature...hey, you can't get any better than that, as far as I'm concerned.<br />I keep thinking, as I'm reading it, that this book will become a historical classic.  I can see people into the Millennium and beyond picking it up with reverence as they go back in time - &quot;back&quot; to the Twentieth Century and &quot;back&quot; to the Nineteenth - Emily's time.  <br />Congratulations to Mr. Worrall - he's got IT!  And all the elements are there: the suspense, the mystery, the reverence for art, the criminality, the greed, obfuscation and scurrilousness of Sotheby's (remind me, when I get rich, not to &quot;go there&quot;), and, yes, the compassion for the idealistic and honest Mr. Lombardo and the Amherst library folks - the victims of the nasty Mr. Hoffman and the cold-hearted Sotheby's.	2002-08-12

Deadly dull: the writing	Cheez, it went on and on.  Someone said it earlier...the Edgar has given Smith the &quot;clout&quot; to pour out bad writing.<BR>If you just like to skip through a book til you find the (unbelievably implausible) culprit, you might like it.  The 12-step theme and Skip Langdon are the only reasons to even pick it up with two fingers...but the writing is drawn out, repetitive, unimaginative, choppy - hell, if this were a senior high school thesis I'd send it back for revisions!<br />Julie Smith should know better. We all had such high hopes with New Orleans Mourning.  She should have stopped there, written a totally different kind of book.  She has the potential of an artist...how far she has strayed.  They should have made a movie of New Orleans Mourning so she could &quot;retire&quot; gracefully with stacks of money and not have to turn out detective stories over and over.  Believe me, she's not good at it.  She's not a James Lee Burke or Moseley or Sandford or Block.  These writers can keep it going for some reason.  How disappointing.  Skip is a great character, but characters are only as good as the writing that surrounds them, and I'm afraid that, without a movie, Skip will be so much molasses in a few years.	2002-08-11
US	37236260	R17AWHONU2IWUQ	068480154X	655275342	Tender Is the Night	Books	5	2	4	N	N	The writing is exquisite...he's the greatest, incomparable!	A.J. of Maryland, a former reviewer, said it all about the gorgeous writing.  The word \\"ambrosia\\" was used - yes, this book is like a great gourmet feast, where literary skill is concerned.  Fitzgerald cannot be copied because his style is so uniquely his own.<br />As for comparison with \\"Gatsby\\": I did not enjoy \\"Gatsby\\" as much as \\"Tender.\\"  \\"Gatsby is, indeed, nearly a perfect novel.  It has been described by the great literary critic Milton Hindus in a monograph about the book  as resembling the tiny inner workings of a Swiss watch...you peer inside and wonder how the craftsman could have created something so intricate, jewel-like, perfect.<br />And yet, \\"Gatsby\\" did not move me like this book.  \\"Tender certainly has its flaws. Some of them are quite laughable because of what we know today about mental illness, alcoholism, homosexuality (that these things are not \\"curable,\\" for instance...that homosexuality does not lead to a downward spiritual spiral, etc.)  And yet, the \\"Tender\\" part of the title stands.  This book quivers with love and tenderness.<br />Historically, this book is uniqely autobiographical.  I couldn't help feeling, as I read, that Fitzgerald wanted to set things straight about his relationship with Zelda.  Refuting the belief that  \\"Dick (read: Scott) married Nicole (read: Zelda) for her money\\" might have been the pivotal idea Fitzgerald was trying to get across, though it probably seems unlikely to most readers.   Still, that line, spoken by a minor character, leapt out at me.   I thought, He wants us to know that it is not true: he adored Zelda; he wanted to take care of her because she was mentally fragile and only succeeded in being dragged down by their co-dependence; he wanted to be his own man, but as a writer never could live up to her huge wealth; still, he liked the things money can buy - who could blame him; in the end, the madness and drinking and inequality of resources caused him to \\"dive,\\" like his hero, Dick Diver,  into dissolution and failure. <br />I disagree with the comment of another reviewer that the lack of development of the children's characters meant that they were not loved.  Of course, it was a dysfunctional family, so in that case \\"love\\" has a lot of strings attached to it...however, I know that the Fitzgeralds loved their daughter, Scotty.  She turned out to be a delightful, well-adjusted person, from what I've heard.  But more than that, I felt that Fitzgerald didn't want to drag his daughter or even fictional children into the sordid adult tale.  He actually did them a favor leaving them out.  Also, it must be remembered that adults and children interacted differently in earlier times in this century.  Children played a far more minor role in their parents' lives - especially children of the very rich, who were often cared more by governesses and other servants than their own parents.  In fact, it's amazing that the Diver children played such an important role in the book at all.  <br />It is fun to read about the psychiatric community in the 'twenties, and the old attitudes people had about mental and addictive diseases.  However, there is a certain amount of condescending racism, classism, sexism  and even an anti-semitic reference here and there in the book.<br />And yet - Fitzgerald is a master.  I recommend the short stories...I think these are the jewels in his crown.	2002-08-08

For me, it stands on its own, completely.<br />It could become a classic.  It would also make a great film,<BR>maybe with actors as original as Jerry Seinfeld and Michael Richards in the lead roles.  <br />This is a book that is less about vaudeville, however, than about  friendship.  And the female characters are uncharacteristically complex for a novel...hosannas to the author, who is so  much more talented than Pat Conroy or even (dare I say it?) Richard Ford, at writing about women AND men in depth.  Here is a lesson for all of us writers in how to create multi-dimensional characters...not just cartoons, or cardboard ones.  Don't get me wrong.  Those writers I mentioned are among my favorites, however, their secondary characters simply are not as developed as McCracken's.  Dickens knew how to do it, as did Tolstoy. I put her right up there with the masters.<br />Her metaphors are to die for...they are so natural, they're organic...you barely notice them until they've passed, and then you find yourself sighing with delight. She's a poet...deserves a Pulitzer. Thanks, Elizabeth! (I, too, went to Newton schools and spent many hours at the Newton Public Library...it's a great place to become a writer!)	2002-08-07
