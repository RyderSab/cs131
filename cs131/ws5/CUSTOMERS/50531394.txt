Stabler's creativity fairly paralleled the post-modern experience, like Cage in many ways with smatterings and gestures into performance art,graphic notation,different instruments,and procedures even when the piece of music is fairly genre-bound as his anti-nuclear \\"Warnung mit Liebeslied\\" the performers, Harp, Accordeon and Tuned Bottles can take on the persona of actors, players addressing the subject matter.Stabler likes rhythm as a cohesive element as a structural means and frequently simply uses it as a base.<br />This book has wonderful graphic examples as well of this,scores,sketches, manuscript excerpts, photos.<br />Stabler has played both sides of the fences in his work in expressive situations within the vagaries and force fields of modernity that of innovation,the technical/conceptual; again the influence of Cage, and Schnebel is remarkable,in that he always finds his own voice within the materials,as nefarious and incomplete as they sometimes are;And then there is the socially conscious, the political, aspects no one desires to pursue has been a source for work by Stabler.  In the early Eighties for example his gut-wrenching chamber work with reciter focused on the massacre of Palestinians in \\"Sabra und Chantila\\" this drew some controversy of a German composer dealing with this subject matter.. The music he wrote in the Eighties was like an on-going dialogue with Marxist Hanns Eisler.Recall that Eisler for German composers continues to be a rich source, a conceptual reservoir for materials and continuation of a part of culture that was snuffed out by the reaction during the darkest times, the eradication of the Left in Germany,which is often forgotten, Stabler's \\"Total\\" for piano solo for example is a work of procedures and charts, graphs, and directions, and utilizes Eisler's song, \\"the torn dress\\" but is deceptively present within the the negated space of piano harmonics,like a mist, or a timbral dream, only audible if you know the tune, and know when it occurs.The pianist needs to wear headphones to capture the various tempi transformations.<br />Much of the essays here are by Stabler himself with position pieces as \\"Fur spater jetzt\\" like a self-dialogue on what he finds important in composition. He had frequently interviewed those who cared to listen to his music and those that didn't as a garbage man walking down the street, asking what he thought music should do. There is also his lecture \\"Silence (Ver-)Schweigen\\", where he speaks about the latter music of Luigi Nono,of \\"Prometeo\\" and his second teacher Nicolaus A.Huber(also a student of Nono) (the first was Stockhausen).<br />Dieter Schnebel, an important composer of text pieces, also a compelling performance artist within the post-modern writes about Stabler's collective improvisation-like piece, \\"Hart auf hart\\", this is a sheet, (11 X 17) of a graphic array of the commercially used zebra stripes,identifying commodities,but here utilized as rhythms,the work is for any number of instruments/players; but there is also the subtext of ecology I suppose, of utilizing things already in the real world. And Stabler has indulged in these games countless times, using materials from all parts of music history but erased from their context, played with muted piano strings, with ones(a second players) hands, so the result is simply a rhythm very beautiful and percussive.<br />Stabler also did a fare amount of commissioning of pipe organ works(his first instrument) and here we have Christian Wolff's \\"Black Song Organ Preludes\\" from 1987 used with permission from the publisher with Wolff's notes. These have been played numerously in the USA and Europe.These are primary Wolff;(the period of the piano \\"preludes\\",and chamber works) melodic bound yet unfinished and convoluted,aggressive and threadbare and it has an indeterminate-like simplicity, and the organist needs to select his/her own registrations for timbres.<br />Max Nyffeler, under a piece \\"Utopische Skepsis, kuhle Satire\\" explores Stabler's performance art. He(Stabler) has always been a performer in his own works, whether via a keyboard instrument, his voice,using a bullhorn,his body,clapping out a rhythm,playing percussion pieces,anything really, a stick, or stomping on the floor. He does wonderfully exciting, gut-wrenching things with the untrained/trained voice, like breathing exceptionally hard for a while and fast, increasing in tempo,until a painful stroke occurs to halt the progess. This while a violist strums a string out-of tune.<br />Stabler proves what STockhausen said some years ago that one should be able to make music with/from anything, any materials, and find some part, some aspect of dimension that deems itself interesting. Stabler however has always kept an eye on innovation,and finding himself in differing genres; technical and conceptual and always tries to subvert a genre once chosen. His operas for example utilze film and complex lighting arrays as well as machine-like contraptions that make noises. (Maurcio Kagel seems to be the ontologic source here.) He also has pieces where the musicians reside within a fence, :shadows of wild pain: where one or two slowly break away to strum their bow to make a timbre on the fence, a metaphor for un-freedom I suppose.rations for timbres.

Carter said he merely wanted to write music he thought was interesting in the Sixties and so he could under the neo-liberal order.<br />This is a dark,thorny,fully impassioned work yet it allows \\"sunshine\\",reflection(s) inside the texture of things in density and timbre,and in complexity to come through.<br />The piano solo and the orchestra begin their arguments,their probings as equals, very democratic,very exciting,the incessant assymetrical rhythms and poly-rhythms between the soloist and the winds/ / /,the orcehstration is interesting for the piano  seems to mimic or stay within identical registers to whomever else in the orcehstra is uttering a declamation or idle intervallic thought/ / / no shifting of emphasis and function, of tossing and relaying music materials between, in fact the orchestra comes to \\"freeze\\" itself, in contracting itself in compacted clusters,cecoming less free as the work progresses,this while the piano tries to find an expressive way out of this cul de sac and never really does, even resorting to now full brutal dialogue( in the ;second movement;), the piano comes to ask questions, while maintaining its full virtuoso flair and expressive demeanor never succombing to the torrent of timbre in the orchestral forces.High register winds, snarling brass come to help cadences of moments, and the piano plunges right in to help disrrupt anything that claimed to be \\"unifying\\".At times as well the piano shares particular register to augment/further an argument as the \\"basso\\" regions with low tom-toms and tympani; The work is incredibly compact/impacted within two movements (of 10 minutes and 12 and one half minutes) respectively.This structure seems to work much better than the more fragmented \\"Concerto for Orchestra\\" which seems to meander and finds itself without purpose as it progresses,at least to this listener. On paper,in score I suspect all Carter makes clarity an art of shape and tone of rhythmic dimensions.In the \\"Piano Concerto\\" however Carter allows interestingly enough the full basso timbres of the piano to come through,single tones,like revealing yet another aspect of a persona, another side to a facial contour never seen prior in time. This can and does halt the rhythmic momentum,going forward,it does and does not at times, the rather dense convoluted textures which he allows are present as a given, and Gielen and Oppens(in their recording) are incredible in the clarity they bring to this complex score by anyones definition.There is a timbral beauty in Carter if you know where to look.His music looks forward by looking backwards;this gives his music a real powerful agenda,in that we come to re-experience, the quasi-romantic/expressionist charms and arrogant expressions.<br />Arnold Hauser in one of his \\"histories\\" on the visual arts says someplace that the entire \\"romantic\\" constitution comes from the\\"anarchic\\", the exposed,the abandoned premise, the unencumbered, of a new class fettered no more and finding new freedoms in merchant capitalism within the 19th Century. Well Carter is a traditional/modernist but one whose affinity resorts to these romantic dimensions of expressions in that his creative pallette did not venture to far afield,the center of his creativity remains within a predictable consciousness. His music will never surprise you,or take you unawares of some dimension of what modernity can do, or should do.I think that this is part of its wide appeal, that within the the alienation schemes practiced within the modernist language in music, Carter's music is knowable, one can come to follow it without too much arduous exchange within one's psychology.<br />There are exposed solo lines as well in the winds and a solo violin ala Richard Strauss primarily in the ;second movement; the flute, and the \\"new\\" timbre (for its time) the Bass Clarinet;nice round tones allowed to pass the tyrannical gaze of the piano. The work as it progresses wants to end itself, it becomes somewhat neurotic in not discovering a resolution for itself.It works nonetheless much better than the \\"Concerto for Orcehstra\\".rauss primarily in the ;second movement; the flute, and the \\"new\\" timbre (for its time) the Bass Clarinet;nice round tones allowed to pass the tyrannical gaze of the piano.

Of course you can also say that this work is an intense celebration, a fullfillment of strong brutal ideas for their own sake, not for anyone,unadorned,unencumbered by any narrative,relishing in deeply virtuosic timbres, revealing a content of extroversion,one not afraid(within the aesthetic) of anything anymore. This Quartets dimensions it seems knows no boundary markers with its duel forces pitted against each other, like a palace rebellion strictly of aristocrats had occurred without the outside populace knowing about it. So here the DUO I is Violin and Cello,cloistered together where pitches and tone configuration seem to be boundless,more rhapsodic in playing (as Carter advises in his notes \\"quasi rubato\\") to the more imprisoned DUO II, Violin and Viola,(stricter rhythm(s) throughout) taking on here more an accompanimental role,equally with Carter's affinity for the sustained string sound, this un-freedom functions nonetheless and makes the music stop,halts the flow of itself and/or create a magnificent tension so the work wants to proceed,but cannot, wants to fulfill itself it does so with a large array of durational indication, expanding and contracted in surface in register,very liberal utilizations of double stops as well, as if one single voice along never quite fits the emotive agenda here there is also a :dialectic:( a bad word) of emotive content at work with often times contradictory indications between the two DUO, as the opening exhibits simultaneously \\"Maestoso\\" in DUO II, and \\"Furioso\\" (quasi rubato,)in DUO I,this suggested hostility continues quite to the end.<br /><br />The modern British painter Francis Bacon had said that longevity within this language, (meaning expressionisms of sorts,equal to Carter's musical substance)that tension remains forever in art where it may exist,as even the private pastoral tensions in the continuous tonal movements of trees and mountain surfaces in Poussin's massive landscapes,geometrically pure,but unknown at dirst So to Carter I beleive in some array of poly-rhythmic durational scheme takes this work's strength from under its rhythmic surface passive perhaps on the surface, but look closer for the tension. Here passive acceptance in Carter is by degrees,and within his affinity for establishing characters within the genres,resolution simply goes away forgotten as unimportant.<br /><br />In Carter's introductory notes, he advises that the :sustained sound:, and the fast tones will tend to get \\"covered by notes of medium speed\\", so an interpretive problem exists in the clarity of this duel of virtuosity, of dodecaphonic remorse. The work has a dryness to me, never seductive, or in a way suggestive of Lucien Freud's work, equally dry yet not devoid of emotion, below the surface. Here the surface brutality usually foments, throws our listening into the work, deeply engaging without an agenda.The work has no resolution,or it implodes upon itself really and as it progresses it deeply exposes its content, what it has been about,that the violence sought after in the beginning becomes tamer to a degree in its totality beaming,projecting itself in fragements,like incomplete thoughts, \\"fugitives\\"(as Pierre Aimard might say) where it becomes like a flame-furioso, given less oxygenfor its existence snuffed out, stepped on for a time.istence snuffed out, stepped on for a time.	2005-09-14

There is greater diversity of everyone contributing toward an emotive center,more soloist lines exposed, the brilliant cello returns again , as in the First Quartet each part leading into the next player,interruptions only occur when new materials are needed to prod things along, like electric charges, or a new light added to the rhythmic maze pursued herein' each player entering fully conscious of the purpose of the phrase and direction of the proceedings herein, even if the materials are purely accompanimental and marginal to the quartets agenda.

Overall there seems to be greater assertiveness of purpose here, shorter time length half the time of the 40 minute First Quartet. This Second Quartet, seems to relish in the relative brevity of its existence,with cleaner threadbare lines, keeping less independence, yet not entirely so. The emotive thorny questioning state(from the First Quartet) is pulled in as well, there is far less ground to tread here, and the beauty comes through all the more.

The Harpsichord which can be amplified is first in exposition of materials,you hardly know the piano exists,lighly trying to penetrate the discussion,like some marginal prophet trying to find where it belongs, with lightly sprinkled finger cymbals and idle taps on a metal plate, there is not much sustaining power here unless you find these overwhelming arpeggiations in the harpsichord which Carter does employ, each orchestra has their own materials, their own intervallic language,timbres,rhythms to establish who they are in Cartesian formation, like a \\"clash of civilizations\\"to a degree promuligated now for greater divisions of greed and wealth, so to within the realms of the aesthetic these metaphors have some substance,The piano then comes to dominate the latter half of the piece,within its more rotund timbres to help convey its persona, trombones and lower strings and winds help this tyranny along, and lower tom-toms, these timbres do interestingly enough cross in diagonals between chamber borders, and if all these expressive emotive minutae are not sorted out you have a real quagmire on your hands/ / / if you have strong persuasive musician soloists as Ursula Oppens, the piece ceases the \\"double concerto\\" narrative.

The earlier Brahmsian/Copland-esque \\"Piano Sonata\\" from the Forties, has its points of interests,rolling rotund resonant timbres,bombastic declamations but that is an earlier Carter,formative times and a different set of creative paradigms at work actually, prior to the maturity and interest that set in after the \\"First String Quartet\\". . .  The golden fruits of maturity has seen many works even an opera of mixed quality,and predictable-ness some of the solos and duets,dedications as \\"Espirit rude\\" are quite glib materials,tossed off. Here however the \\"Night Fantasies\\" is an interesting piece of music,certainly one that has entered the modern piano literature, a modern nocturne of darkness for dark times which never seem to recede,simply differing gradations of it. This work has entered the mainstream and academia naturally and you can see it played on piano competitions,although difficult to perform in that all the suggestive timbral layers Carter employs/deploys need continuous clarity.He sets a large pallette of piano attacks,mixed with an equal distributions of dynamics sustained moments mixed with more percussive effects,staccato with sustained, cloistered-like chorals deployed.If this agenda for \\"layering\\" is abandoned well the work will cohere-melt into one quite boring unadorned glob of timbre, suggestive of Schumann or Brahms having lived through World War 2.Ursula Oppens and Charles Rosen have exhibited the most interesting readings I think,and quite recently Pierre Laurent Aimard,in a nice recording with his own commnetary thrown in.I would like to hear Frederic Rzewski play this work, with his overriding dynamic approach and technical clarity he can summon to his fingers and perhaps glean the overbearing romantic-nesses from the work, making it leaner and more articulated.That is always the problem with modernity of this kind,it always tempts the interpreter into a more facile reading,more direct, more bound to the aesthetic of the romantic as Solti playing Schoenberg as Brahms or as he had done with Carter's \\"Variations for Orchestra\\" he had takened on tour.. If you bring direct unencumbered musicianship to Carter the music will reward you, and if you acknowledge its intellectual agendas you will be twice blessed.<br />Jon Link has done excellent work on mapping the poly-rhythmic distributions of this work,and David Schiff's excellent book to a less exhaustive degree and Yes! some can hear all of it,the poly-rhythms, layered textures if you have a map inside your head, and have some pre-requisite home study of the score prior to a listening experience, but short of that the work still harbors a neo-romanticism with an affinity for modernity, the wonderful fast furioso filigree displays, \\"fugitive\\" lines wanting to escape from the work's structural tyranny has a kind of other wordly quality.like to hear Frederic Rzewski play this work, with his overriding dynamic approach and technical clarity he can summon to his fingers and perhaps glean the overbearing romantic-nesses from the work, making it leaner and more articulated.That is always the problem with modernity of this kind,it always tempts the interpreter into a more facile reading,more direct, more bound to the aesthetic of the romantic as Solti playing Schoenberg as Brahms or as he had done with Carter's \\"Variations for Orchestra\\" he had takened on tour..

At this time Xenakis was working as assistant to Le Corbusier on The Convent of La Tourette (1953-1960),and from this Xenakis had developed a concept of space through the design of the side chapel of this site created in darkness. With \\"gentle light cannons\\" however Xenakis was able to redefine the space and configurations; light was then allowed to \\"cut\\", \\"incises\\" from this undefined darknesses. So the space is no longer defined simply by the volume structured by walls; what you perceive as space,as depth,as volume becomes more fluid,and glib. Light volume was a controlling function here.<br />Also exhibited another performance art work was at the Shiraz Festival in Iran in 1971, when the Shah was Washington's proxy, this at the ruins of Persepolis. Xenakis had designed another installation a counterpoint of light,bonfire,(in a distance)as well as timbre, space and volume, also densities, texture of light timbre mixed.. Some 59 loudspeakers,an 8 channel tape of primarily \\"musique concrete\\" sounds, 92 spotlights, 2 lasers directed at the sky in a configuration. The light program here is also updated every 1/25th of a second so to keep again the fluidity of the work in some kind of motion.(Actually beaming lasers acros great dimensions of the Earth in some mathematical configuration(s) is a way, a means of contacting extraterrestial beings, should they be watching)<br />Finally,for the opening of the Pompidou Centre in Paris in 1978 Xenakis created \\"Le Diatope\\" featuring here strobe lights, colored lasers, green and blue and red,with mirros to reflect the light in various symmetrical configurations.This book hansomely illustrates much of this including onion skin paper as overlays for the effects of the conceptions here,density distributions are also charted in acoustical graphs, top to bottom of frequencies utilized. You also find here sketches done Xenakis for every feature of this work, light,sound,space.I cannot help think how this work had influenced the music Xenakis then wrote,how the experience of space, working in different places, and experiencing how light comes to occupy,embellish,taut and punctuate a space had impinged on his more self-contained compact music he had written.But in circumvention to this Xenakis had designed much of his \\"polytopes\\" from scores he had written in varying degree of \\"voices\\" imparted throughout a space on the musical partitura page. Again the fluidity of space had influenced the fluidity of the conceptual working procedures.in various symmetrical configurations.This book hansomely illustrates much of this including onion skin paper as overlays for the effects of the conceptions here,density distributions are also charted in acoustical graphs, top to bottom of frequencies utilized.

Musical Academia in the USA is/has been rather cloistered,inward looking and concerned with its own self-preservation.So beyond the plethora of Schenkerian probes in print for the Dominant progressions from Ursatz editions,or Set Theory excursis(as fascinating as that is)  there was really nothing, anything of interest to read.

Scherchen was the first conductor to find Xenakis interesting, someone with a unique voice he thought with another vision of what modernity means in timbre in durational shapes... Xenakis had visited Scherchen in his hotel room for consultation on the forthcoming premiere of Xenakis''Metastasis'as he went in he saw Scherchen in bed with the enormous orchestral pages covering him.<br />Also included here are essays on his Theories of probability,stochastic music, how tones come to be distributed over an orchestral canvas of strings for instance where you have multiple divisi demarcations.And how one can come to define chaos. Certainly all this pre-dates thinking today of fractals music, complexity and the computer as a primary aesthetic focus.<br />Xenakis frequently would chart out in graphic representation the direction and overall shape of the density/distribution of the piece, and then transcribe the work in traditional notation.<br />Early works as well are discussed as 'Pithoprakta' from the first version. There is also borrowed material from his interesting book \\"Musique Architecture\\" where the use of computers as far back as the early Sixties was in his creative pathway of thinking,all the music with titles having \\"ST\\" as a string quartet for example was from this period.<br />\\"Musique et originalite\\" also renders Ianni's views on originality in music, a somewhat outdated commonplace means where today only pedant scholars still search in great arrogant profundity for the truly original in homogenized musical discourse of establishment venues today.

Only six of these are dedicated to music.\\"Vers use philosophie de la musique\\" has a kind of in depth interest seeing the philosopher side of Xenakis. And really there is nothing original there. He primarily has used ancient texts,Plato as trigger points to think about music and its context,also within the paradigm of science and how that may come to influence how music is constructed.In many respects Xenakis has not kept in dialogue with the intellectual cadre of France, as Sartre, Foucault and Derrida.He believes that body of work is separate, and does not contribute toward his vision anyway of music, and how it is constructed. Here included is an analysis of his primordial gritty Cello Solo \\"Nomos Alpha\\",a wonderful piece with incessantly plucked strings, quarter tones, 'airplane like' glissandi,and tuning (at the very end) the C string down an octave while being bowed. This work is an example of Xenakis' concept of formalization in music. I tend to think if you simply listen to the work, the hardtheory supporting it will osmosi-size into your intellect nonetheless. His \\"Sieve Theory\\" is also explained the almost \\"filtering\\" of tones within a work. The music of Xenakis recall utilized much of the time large densities of tones,pitches,clusters, mists you can call them,so he needed something, some concept to control these \\"clouds\\" arborescences\\" of tones.<br /><br />The three chapters on music here \\"Les trois paraboles\\"(1958), \\"Trois poles de condensation\\" (1962) and \\"Formalisation et axiomatisation de la composition musicale\\" (1964) is like a summary of Xenakis' ideas on music.There are also essays on the use of electronic music, something he had pioneered quite extensively in the Sixties also utilizing \\"musique concrete\\", as in his \\"Bohor 1\\", where he had taped the\\"sparkling timbres, tiny particles of sound, of the \\"breaking\\" when charcoals are subjected to heated treatment.\\"Notes sur un 'geste electronique'\\"(1958) also includes how electronic might aid in the spatialization of timbre,something that now  is commonplace in conceptions.<br /><br />The second edition of this work includes a third section that is about music and archetitectural graphics, the role of the artist with the aid of science, and a table of correspondences between the the developments of music and mathematics, something you will also find in his Doctorate promuligated through France, in \\"Arts:Science Alloys\\".

US	50531394	R2WVRJIL7KE04O	2070111741	137324439	Le pays fertile: Paul Klee (French Edition)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	ontology of purpose	Paul Klee's work has been an enduring place of habitation for Pierre Boulez, since his early days as an unofficial student in<br />Paris, seeing Klee's canvases in Paris for the first time represented a new way to think about the possibilities of music.Musical Academia in post-war France was abominable,backward looking,conservative and remained so even up through the Seveties when Andre Malraux(long before) was the cultural Czar of France. Malraux thought music as a marginal art form compared to literature of paintings largely because he was too ignorant to follow its innovations and achievements. Boulez left France for the fertile ground of Germany where a string of conducting positions and premieres of his new works were part of the lifeworld there.<br /><br />Klee for Boulez represented a way out of the quagmire, the paradigm of expression in post-war Europa that from the patrilinear descent of the Second Viennese School, Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern(Eisler is left out,but a rich important member nonetheless)and from the rhythmic innovations of Boulez's teacher mentor Olivier Messiaen. Klee's duly proportioned works of predictable textures, and colour gradations, tone schemes was the ground to begin to think within the context of music in differing ways, in ways of process where a work can be thought through to its continuation, through what sustains its unfolding in time, what gives it its durational shapes, and means for uniting texture and register, dynamic,timbre and pitch configurations. Largely Boulez wanted to break free from serial thinking in music a creative pathway he never found comfortable, at least not until after his exhaustive \\"structures\\" for two pianos.Then the use of aleatoric means as in his \\"Third Piano Sonata\\", had mixed results for Boulez, and certainly not a direction that ustained his interest and would have proved beneficial to his latter music. So Klee's often playful work was this place of creative habitation that Boulez fully expounds here in \\"Le pays fertile\\", the ground that bears fruit, or a pathway, a vigorous one for creativity and context. Reference is also made to Klee's numerous \\"Notebooks\\" where he makes parallels with the graphic world of function,of line and context,what they can come to mean, of tone,and spatial trajectories that the avant-garde in music would adopt itself. Although Boulez in retrospect found no affinity for musical graphics as say the Cage School,(John Cage and Earle Brown in particular)had or Sylvano Bussoti and Cornelius Cardew all from differing creative perspectives.He found a representation of Klee's visual approaches in the spatial dimensions of music. (Loud events obviously being closer to the listener,to softer ones more away in a hinterland distance.)Later Boulez would come to see the spatiality of means as in his \\"repons\\" with the use of the 4X computer as an aid to distribute timbre antiphonally, yet as an emanation from one single source the live ensemble of instrumentalists.<br />Reading this work, a fragment of a hommage to Klee draws one into Boulez's creativity itself,and if you know his work, his music,you can see where ideas and compositional concepts may have emanated from its ontology.e pays fertile\\", the ground that bears fruit, or a pathway, a vigorous one for creativity and context.

It is late Boulez, the more accessible period where dimensions of surface seem to have interested him yet not in a simplistic way.Many draw the same breath of this \\"Incises\\" with the youthful(quite widely played) \\"12 Notations\\" for piano solo,but those earlier shibboleths were quite naive little piano textures,violent and brutal,yet obvious and predictable,well they were student creations revealing an interest in modernity. \\"Incises\\" for piano solo here however was destined for larger habitations as the \\"12 Notations\\" (that found themselves metamorphosized into brilliant orchestral etudes.  Boulez seems to have takened a deep interest late in life in the music materials as objects where the creator then through some functional plan can work where the music can go by themselves templates shapes, forms \\"readymades\\" I guess we can call them,something already in the world;very post-modern inorientation.\\"Incises\\" here found a resting place in the much more ambitious prize winning \\"Sur Incises\\" for Three Pianos, Three Harps, and Three Tuned Percussion instruments. Curious how \\"Sur Incises\\" still maintains its \\"etude\\" dimension\\" not really setting itself into an \\"Other\\" trajectory. But I like to consider \\"Incises\\" the piano solo and its revision in 2001 as a totally isolated piece absorbed in its own pathways, and places for piano timbre.\\"Incises\\" the term refers to \\"cutting\\",not the way people of all expressive lifeworld modes today cut themselves (as a signifier for -feeling- [real]), but more a function of time and [nature], the way the inevitable flow of water for example ;cuts; itself into a river as it slowly descends down a continent,how channels :cuts: through sediment, or more lapidarian how a steel needle might<br />=cut= a metal plate. Boulez's creativity has searched at times for process, how a concept might come to define and direct the way the music and its materials proceeds and envelopes itself in durational shapes,time and lengths. We could even speak of Piaget's theories on how children experience time, to find where Boulez's quite obvious piano solo here finds itself,its function. The piece has many repeated tones,very virtuosic,very direct,no mysteries; it plays itself to the grandstands.The \\"cutting\\" is in the way lines interrupt,intermingle, glide,roll,turn,bend,shape override and juxtapose themselves/itselves onto each other\\"cutting\\" themselves within the texture of the musical proceedings.

And Cecile Gilly's questions here seem commonplace yet they excite quite provocative answers. Of course one must see a work in rehearsal with Boulez in order to find this \\"sortest distance\\" ourselves, as those available with his own\\"Notations\\" being prepared. But short of that. . .<br />Here the interviews have a chronology,and we learn for Boulez with his youthful beginnings in the Fifties it engaged the presentation of the best possible performance of the products of modernity,of activism as well for the cause of the new.He speaks here of his learning processes acquired/formulated  quite directly in attendance of rehearsals of Hans Rosbaud and Roger Desormiere, later Otto Klemperer in his last years in London. Klemperer actually phoned Boulez requesting permission to attend a Boulez rehearsal of his works.Boulez's humanism is wonderful to think about that he openly admits he had no orchestral technique of writing effectively for the orchestra during the earlier part of this career. Now he has the maturity,experience and retrospection to re-vise these works, as the \\"Le Visage Nuptial\\" and \\"Les Soliel Des Eaux\\". These were works that had an \\"overdetermined\\" polyphony.<br />We encounter these problems today in learning the modernist language for there still is a shortage of interpreters of the New.The last part here is \\"Transmitting knowledge\\" which is really the content of conducting and learning music as well. There is a section on young conductors where the skills during a Master Class become readily apparent. Boulez says, young conductors are first and foremost are concerned with themselves, not the work, their own means and work habits. Go after the problems of the work,appreciate the timbre and the structure, Why is it unique and interesting? not how one will interpret it.<br />For conducting we know that there was no work within the modernist repertoire that Boulez did not dare to try.This is how he claimed territory,and acquired technique. No others cared to have this affinity for the new for the Star-System of conductors was in place throughout the Fifties and Sixties...at least in the USA.But there is a modest appraisal of time and place that emerges here in these interviews, that of problems of performance,the technique of it, of balance of orchestral forces and timbre. Boulez says here that most conductors don't have a deep appreciation for the timbre of things, of the music, more the gesture,its effect on the populace,and music is finding solutions of interpretation of projecting timbre, sound colours , and finding them takes time and emerges only within a process of change and contemplation. The first performances of Alban Berg's \\"Wozzeck\\" for example in Paris, where some 31 rehearsals were requested by Boulez, or Debussy's \\"Pelleas et Melisande\\",the repertoire of Webern, Schoenberg, and Stravinsky.On Schoenberg and the problems there Boulez says(to paraphrase) yes Schoenberg had  known the effects of timbre, but in his music it is more a function of the motive, where it goes and its demise within the orchestra. Whereas Stravinsky loved sound, just to hear it,regardless of where it went.<br />Other high points discussed here was Wagner's \\"Parsifal\\", then the \\"Ring\\" itself with Patrick Chereau in the Mid-Seventies. Boulez relates a story of Klemperer asked Boulez(referring to Parsifal)\\"How do you deal with all this religiousness? and Boulez's response was \\"He(I) ignore it, and deal with pure technique, the long sheaths of time,slow tempi,and the most mature work within Wagner's oeuvre.Here Cecile Gilly requests basic necessities, but these interviews are more squarely on target, more technical in content on conducting than ones I've read previously. \\"Should a conductor be a composer?\\", she asks, and where,who have been successful composer-conductors?. or \\"What were your artistic aims at that time? What sort of programmes did you wish to conduct?, and a little later, \\"Were these concerts well attended?<br />There are also a traversing over quite traditional materials, as Berlioz the great orchestrator,19th Century music, the evolution of the orcehstra and Wagner as composer and conductor himself. But Boulez has wonderful things to say as \\" Orchestral imagination is a particular gift.\\"Again the simplicity is misleading,for there are those genius composers who really could not orchestrate as Brahms,Chopin, Mussorgsky,Schumann,Scriabin.However Berlioz, had other shortcomings, ones of viable structure, of form in music becoming completely dependant on a narrative,yet still relatively naive in his approach, he founded the modern sounding orchestra with \\"Symphonie fantastique\\". The \\"voicings\\" of chords for example are all conmmonplace root position triads, yet when the contrabasses pluck these\\"commonplace\\" chords they are more percussive and brilliant sounding within the \\"acoustical illusion\\" of the orchestra.<br /><br />Boulez in his terse, yet expansive when needed answers, always places the materials, the \\"musical text\\" as he refers to it, within a context.  One example was the largesse of amplitude of the growing Romantic orchestra, the sound of the overbearing augmentation of the orchestra, due to larger halls, where Beethoven's philosophy(in the last years of the 19th Century) needed Tubas in order to not make flimsy and miniturize the content of his explosive 'Symphonies', Even Mahler got in on this aesthetic of filling the stage with persona,to no great end actually. For the music,not its conception does not change only those who perform and listen to it,they have needs and requirements for realizations that changes.<br /><br />There are also many questions on the founding of IRCAM and the Ensemble Intercontemporain, and the administrative problems encountered.

What sort of programmes did you wish to conduct?, and a little later, \\"Were these concerts well attended?   There are also a traversing over quite traditional materials, as Berlioz the great orchestrator,19th Century music, the evolution of the orcehstra and Wagner as composer and conductor himself. But Boulez has wonderful things to say as \\" Orchestral imagination is a particular gift.\\"Again the simplicity is misleading,for there are those genius composers who really could not orchestrate as Brahms,Chopin, Mussorgsky,Schumann,Scriabin.However Berlioz, had other shortcomings, ones of viable structure, of form in music becoming completely dependant on a narrative,yet still relatively naive in his approach, he founded the modern sounding orchestra with \\"Symphonie fantastique\\". The \\"voicings\\" of chords for example are all conmmonplace root position triads, yet when the contrabasses pluck these\\"commonplace\\" chords they are more percussive and brilliant sounding within the \\"acoustical illusion\\" of the orchestra.      Boulez in his terse, yet expansive when needed answers, always places the materials, the \\"musical text\\" as he refers to it, within a context.  One example was the largesse of amplitude of the growing Romantic orchestra, the sound of the overbearing augmentation of the orchestra, due to larger halls, where Beethoven's philosophy(in the last years of the 19th Century) needed Tubas in order to not make flimsy and miniturize the content of his explosive 'Symphonies', Even Mahler got in on this aesthetic of filling the stage with persona,to no great end actually. For the music,not its conception does not change only those who perform and listen to it,they have needs and requirements for realizations that changes.     There are also many questions on the founding of IRCAM and the Ensemble Intercontemporain, and the administrative problems encountered.

Wagner's pathological ways of endowing characters and dramatic situations as sometimes reflections of things he himself had experienced was not the way to proceed in art,but skewed imagery that worked nonetheless in certain respects like his trip to the hellish London Docks as a metaphor for the oppressive beneath the earth Nibelungen-land.His inconsistentcy of character building as the power of the gods being determined by Wotan's Security Agreements with himself.Well this conceit is what had preserved the aristocracy in Europa,again as a metaphor in the \\"Ring\\". Poor Brunnhilde,once a god for example becomes a mortal,but it was necessary for her to have to bring the destruction of the gods. (None of her Sister Walkure helped)<br />Adorno utilized the \\"fetish\\" concept from Marx his entire life it was a triggering point for determining what had remained \\"Art\\" for him and what had transgressed into the vagaries of whatever the market had necessitated as popular culture, detective film noirs jazz and the post-war avant-garde. Some beleive Adorno went a bit into the metaphysical for no known reason and the jazz he had listened to was the surface kind Hollywood would have promoted, he never heard John Coltrane for example or Cecil Taylor.(It is odd that Adorno only found \\"innovative-ness\\" in certain forms and not others, Schoenberg and not Stravinsky)<br />But with Wagner he is on his own turf with the hypocrisies residing within modern German culture(something the Ring had profoundly represented actually) of the Junker ruling Classes as he had looked at what culture was promoted and what then was considered\\"subversive\\"  (His diatribe against Richard Strauss is another example where he claimed his melodies reached for the sky without much content or constructive ontology as the Krupp & Thyssen smokestakes from the Ruhr Valley.<br /><br />The book on Wagner has chapters on various aesthetic categories, \\"Tone\\", \\"Dramaturgy\\",\\"The Social\\" \\"Text\\",\\"Orchestration\\", and \\"Phantasmagoria\\" that\\"other\\" dimension. Wagner was in fact far-looking, he thought of his operas as time related \\"cinemas\\" inhabiting durational frames of the magical,Valhalla, the Real and the Below-the-Earth,different levels of the Symbolic, The Imaginary,and the Real;( Lacan in retrospect would have been a good reservoir for analysis as well.(See Slavoj Zizek's writings on opera) Adorno's primary argument with Herr Wagner is one of construction,of development,of agenda that his working means are quite arbitrary since the music is dependant on the narrative,where characters go,why they go and their demise.(Although the structure of the RING can be considered a symphony with grandiose development internally)  The constructive focus we have is the leit-motiv found simply tossed wandering around as Deleuze's \\"rhizome\\".Where is the the vigours of motivic construction,of developmental variations.Adorno was too conservative to look at this paradigm in this perspective as a buddening element of modernity itself of \\"fragments\\"coexisting together of the \\"incomplete\\"propelled forward for its tension state of irresolution. (Curious again that/how Adrono had the highest regard for the rationed irrationality of Samuel Beckett)(Recall the context of Wagner at this time, the Thirties when there were not high level productions nor interpretive insights into the political and cultural content of Wagner's operas.Brunnhilde still wore cumbersome breastplates and Wotan with his Viking attire as everyone in the Ring inhabiting a neverland of mountains, Rocks and boulders with Giants pounding the pavements)But there are also acknowledged points of sophistication,as the intersting differences in orchestration in the four parts of the \\"Ring\\".(The pastoral \\"Die Walkure\\" contrasted to the \\"flying\\" and the darkened keys of \\"Gotterdamurung\\",the divisi strings,and other worldliness as Alberich's dream-like \\"dialogue\\" with Hagen where many motives are introduced assemblage,collage-like)<br />One chapter \\"Tone\\" for example is a term from the lifeworld of the visual arts and here in music it resides in orchestration as the excessive and interesting use of strident timbre; brass and primarily tenor and bass voices in \\"Siegfreid\\",but then again all this  amplified puffed-up \\"Strength\\" is for a hero who is quite naive,ignorant and unperceptive,easily dupped into doing anything.And yet again the mists let us say of anti-semiticism in the character of Mime are well present( Certainly Wagner's audiences knew of this reference.)Whereas today it is ignored as a \\"relic\\" of the past?? This iswhere the \\"Social\\" element comes into view for his interjecting the \\"exchange\\" relationship as oppsed to the \\"true\\" one as Siegmund and Sieglinde one based on love (although incestual) whereas Sieglinde's relation with Hunding is strictly based on \\"exchange\\" something to be eradicated or resolved in some way.

There are dollips of illuminations(as Tovey might say).<br />I recall a Vintage recording,on RCA Artur Rubenstein, Yasha Heifitz and Fournier??,I forgot the cellist, wonderful telescoping, everyone listened to each other,and made the work compelling, in fact I've yet to hear it played even approaching it. The lyricism in the opening 'Allegro con brio' here is unforgettable,perhaps the key of B major suggests this or brings things out of composers that other Keys cannot or refuse to; the main melodic materials,really a broken resonant chord, the major sixth interval; gorgeous stuff filled with anxiety, the opaque,and the question of art; as well in the more violent turbulent rhytmic passages,like Brahms is saying \\"things are not that nice in Hamburg living as a bachelor\\" Although he thought Bismarck was quite progressive. Glad that Johannes remained a composer his life.<br /><br />There is an orchestration or timbral problem(s) with the other chamber settings most notably the 'string quartets' less so the 'Piano Quintets',(the unforgettable F Minor) in that Johannes thought he was writing for the orchestra, such an enormous sound he thought he believed he was getting from four strings who cannnot project a sound ad infinitum no matter how many double stops are put on the playing field, and as his soaring melodies take up imaginative space that suggest or imply something grander.So Barhms,lis musical language I think struggle between these two lifeworlds. That's why I like the 'Trios', for they seem to coax more refinement, challenge and innovation as well (the Clarinet and the Horn??,avant-garde!!) of timbre from Brahms. The final A minor with the Clarinet also has problems but it looks further unpretenciously than the other works. The Clarinet timbre is quite distinctive and its solo role never seems to go away or recede into the hinterlands,enveloping as you might find in Mozart's Clarinet Quintets)Mozart knew how to shape and \\"melt\\" timbres together, never out of place, and Johannes should have listened or looked at Wolfgang more) but Johannes simply \\"drops\\" it(The Bb Clarinet) in the discourse of the A minor trio,and so the piece might come to be a Sonata for Clarinet with cello and piano accompaniment. He learned the clarinet language from Richard Muelfield(so the ending Clarinet Sonatas are progressive more than Bismarck) to function more than as accompaniment,the piano is a real part not a recepticle to keep time and add nice chords; what kind of accompaniment can a Clarinet provide however when not scouring the heavens for profound materials in romantic music is open to question?, the Romantics did not think of wind instruments as a \\"Solo\\",not really as the 20th Century was come to do, only if it was within the purview of a concerto, and then Brahms would have made music history if he had written a Clarinet Concerto, Think of It ?!!, so in the A Minor the Clarinet again takes up much space, the timbre is not blended well or thought through deeply; it is far from interesting  at each moment but it is there nonetheless, have it rest,,and without the unforgettable violoncello moments, the piece would disintegrate into oblivion; the concluding Scherzo(Allegro) however redeems him the writing is threadbare with a nice minor motif to keep things in the air and directly functional as opposed to the cumbersome 'Adagio' where the piano tones fade quickly away,so the pianist simply sits there doing nothing. The continuous pulsing effect in the piano of chords placed on every beat is simply filler, this is high romanticism I guess so extremities and indulgences and false relationships to other timbres is fine for posterity.<br />The Horn Trio at first as well is pure innovation but again Brahms tried his best but he himself many times in these situations is his own worst enemy, for the Horn is utilized simply as another voice, and it could have bee (as the A Minor where a Viola can be substituted for the Clarinet part) in retrospect the Horn simply \\"doesn't fit\\" and I mean listen to the piece again.It sticks out against the melancholia of the Violin melos, as too much vibrato (Yuckeee!). Ligeti thought he would improve upon this creative paradigm and furnish the trio venue with his newly found post-modern folky surface style-for-the-least-common-denominator(not as interesting than the earlier Ligeti of the 'Cello Concerto', or the 'Second String Quartet'), but Gyorgy tried his hand anyway as Brahms heroically did. ((Again please return to Mozart for some guidance on how to nor \\"drop\\" timbre into the field of play, for they could be, or become \\"unwelcome\\" guests.

The fascinating aspect of the King here is the percussionists cannot utilize sticks, only his/her fingers to tap,scrap,ping,hit thump the instruments, so the beauty is furthered I think in a magical, way, it also reduces the overall dynamic level down,so this piece is like listening to timbre under a microscope, you attention is drawn in on small particles, and fragments of timbre.The numbers situated within the three regions are the number of times the player strikes the instrument(s) depending on the ground rules you select, there is a metronome marking that should be strictly followed.

What makes Zizek interesting to read however (no matter what he writes) is that he disrupts and tests the given symbolic order of things, What's That? that is what is usually shuved down our throats(via CNN,MTV,celebrated talk shows) as analysis or theoretical renderings that simply amount to the same \\"mantra\\" of views usually the liberal kind that is suspect of philosophic/cultural theory or \\"critique\\" especially when one so high powered a thinker as Zizek comes into the field of play, since you cannot understand him or say anything critically of him, He is deemed then\\"Dangerous\\".<br /><br />In reality Zizek's sensibility is wholly suited to speak about Kieslowki's work, Lacan works quite well into getting behind what triggers desire,or wantings,fears and anxieties,where the \\"symbolic\\" order exists how it is continually nurtured through cultur as film. \\"The Decalogue\\" is one such film that tries to test the high symbolic order through the word of god or \\"g-d\\" and it inspires fear in all of us, we fear what we don't know, isn't that what religion (any of them) do they instill fear in us, because we don't know, or are told we don't know,\\"You want to know? follow us. . . \\" Kieslowski's language is,modern threadbare,very straightforward, we get wonderful views of Poland,Warsaw; yet he's able to instill a kind of \\"mystery\\" in the common shape of things;and this 'unknown' of the word of \\"g-d\\" or god; ten commandments,his own spirituality interfaces with our own which makes these ten short films quite powerful. Zizek I think is claiming a kind of \\"stasis\\" in Kieslowski,that we should view the \\"Decalogue\\" as one film not as ten little ones a distinction; an interesting view,very modern, and since his films have a kind of lean functionalism,things just simply move without gimmick unfolding the narrative logically.When viewed this way I think the ten shorts comes across in all its diverse richness;almost as if ten novellas all have inter-referenced schemes and threads that link them all in known and unknown way. Zizek explores various Lacanian topics without specifically mentioning them, as \\"sinthome\\", \\"object petit a\\" something you really don't need but needs to be there anyway,something we think of ourselves that needs to fit in someplace but cannot for it doesn't know what it is yet.Lacanian analysis claims to not expose what you don't know(as Freud) but merely affirms who and what you are right now in order to at least maintain some coherancy and stable moments within yourself.Like a young man's love for a mature woman he cannot have.The young boy has a series of unknowns he's working with,stalking her, watching her 'peeping-tom like'in this way the boy is not threatened and remains in the stable realm he knows best, his own bedroom where he masterbates;but soon this stability is brokened,with an actual meetings with the woman,like stepping on thin ice, you never know where you will fall in,,including your own suicide, Kieslowski I think often caps many of the \\"Decalogue\\"sequences too quickly,as the young boy simply stabbing himself for his oefish awkwardness and has no problem in utilizing gut-wrenching techniques in \\"Though shalt Not Kill\\" as the killing of the young boy who killed an innocent cabdriver.People simply die,or their lives robbed previously,as a concentration camp survivor, or fall into an abyss as the young boy not returning home with messages of his demise from an early computer.<br /><br />If you keep with Zizek I think he delivers insights you will not find within the normal course of theoretical film critic discourse, all you get there is time and tested cliques,predictable \\"mantras\\" that really explain the complexity of films like a cooking show, \\"this was added to intensify. . . \\", \\". . . this moment will make shudder. . . \\",like all you are looking for is what will I get for my money.\\"this was added to intensify. . . \\", \\". . . this moment will make shudder. . . \\",like all you are looking for is what will I get for my money.	2005-04-12

I suspect that is how he wanted it, but Shapey was not a man of the \\"Word\\" and he would be the first to tell you himself that if you cannot communicate with what you already got, you had better give up. Still there is a better way of writing a book,there could have been more excerpts from his music, greater expansion of the concepts Shapey discusses,more studies,assignments,listenings provided.I suspect if you are not already a creative person this book will not be of much help.<br />He begins with the basic materials, What are \\"materials\\"? for writing music, well,rhythm, intervals, chord(s) tones sounding together, so the first lesson is to construct 5 Note chords, and from this one is able to tell what you as a composer like,your DNA of sorts,for example open basso chords would tell someone that you know something about brass, that brass simply sound more \\"heavenly\\" if the voicings are separate,relatively speaking, not so much for strings,where closed positions have a power and less so for winds,open voicings for winds dissipate,unless supported by other factors; unless you desire that mediocre \\"Concert Band\\" sound,avant-garde music can safely unpretenciously move away from that.<br />As the book progresses Shapey always wants one to question what they are doing, why you chose the sequence of tones you did, why the specific succession of tones, and not another, if you say because I want it! that's fine for now.But still think about it. Then counterpoint is introduced, two tones against each other can be an entire dimension one can contemplate for weeks, months, years.What are the \\"functions\\" of the tones when combined, does the flow go upoward, is the music \\"pushed\\" forward or is it stable, \\"stasis\\" Then threeindependent tones,now the difficulty accretes for all tones cannot functiona always the same, some tones are pushing forward while others are not, others are merely subordinated to the others, well then that is \\"accompaniment\\"then four and five, up to eight tones against each other, Shapey also expects you to sing what you write changing the timbre of your voice as best you can for the different voices YOU have written,If you cannot sing it, well how do you expect someone to play it. Conviction man in what one is all about. The key concepts here are how intervallic motives unfold, as \\"circulation\\" around a tone, say \\"D\\" is the primary tone, the home base, then \\"C\\" and C#, and\\"Eb\\" and \\"E\\" are ornamental relatively, not that these tones cannot come into prominence or marked empahsis they do, but D is where you return, like classical thinking of tonality, that you are always moving toward something, this is what conveys meaning to the populace.There are other devices as well you may know, simple statement and alteration, version/perversion, statement-mistatment,or development, or a mirror of,but again the creator must make all this exciting; whatever your imagination allows for contemplation.<br />The end then is you write a Solo Unaccompanied work for Flute or Clarinet, then a work where one may introduce two tones, a piece for Solo Unaccompanied Violin, then a piece for piano, They say Shapey's compositional technique can be utilized for any style of music but really only 12 Tone thinking is where it bears the most fruit in its deepest meaning.I don't know of any minimalists who would utilize this technique nor find use in it. Shapey's compositional method adopts a \\"functionalism\\" that you as a composer should always know what you have, the dynamic of the music, how often you want certain tones made available, made heard. He like Stefan Wolpe(his teacher) brought another dimension to the 12, almost Kaballah like in their interest on disrupting the integrity of the 12 yet finding forever new meanings within this.Music was like a document for all time,contemplated for how it is constructed, its strength is in its parts and how it works together,or not.sion, statement-mistatment,or development, or a mirror of,but again the creator must make all this exciting; whatever your imagination allows for contemplation.

Over the past thirty years he has written essays of a profound nature,as the xenophobia of race after the break up of the Soviet satellites, bio-genetic engineering(quite literally the future of race),and the strengths and weaknesses within Western institutions.He has to date 9 Volumes(in German only) of incredible \\"Political Writings\\".<br />Here,fellow Amazonians all these dribble reviews really masterbations of detritus are less than useless,Habermas deserves better than this;but a sign of democracy I suppose.<br />Habermas with this very comprehensive work is trying to intervene into the current paradigm of law democracy and globalization; how financial institutions(as  an extension of the law, the distribution of wealth) really cannot provide the necessary stability as they once did for the dispossessed within liberal democracies.<br />It is fairly certain now with the arrogant drum beatings of Washington that there is a real threat of loss of power if some Western power does move quickly to manipulate what Engels referred to as the co-relation of forces today,like who controls oil(and natural resources);Technology hence (Time)nuclear power,or space militarization (in the Virilio-ian sense) or for instance who will help the new cheap labour factory, China industrialize.<br />Habermas sees democracy-in-development only in Europe with the formation of the European Union as an activist agent a proxy of intervention from the vagaries and many times anarchy of globalization for the globes working classes.This within the context where Washington sees no equivalent agenda to nurture and desires to jettison all the post-WW2 Atlanticist structures, as the United Nations and their derivatives. These organizations for other reasons have become corrupt,but they still service some parts of the globe who depend upon them for food and medicinal deliveries. The fact that Habermas focuses on the relative strengths of bourgeois laws is indeed his own self-created cul-de-sac as paradigm that there is no alternative to this reality at least not in the forseeable future.I suspect Habermas has been purging himself for quite some time from his early days as Adorno's student from the negative/critical,more classical sides of Marxism that appraises power wherever it exists as an \\"odometer\\", a measure for the dispossessed of the globe, do they eat?,or die?,something that embarasses him I suspect.Laws should monitor where the food chains exist, Laws should monitor atrocities,genocides,corrupt leaders.These very laws (within the West)historically have always been frought with reservations contingencies,and are constructed to preserve the staus quo,and can be easily changed and amended when their agency or proxy comes to an end; yes a classical Marxist view still alive although to some detestable. At least for those below the subsistence levels it is somewhat comforting to know that there is a \\"conscious\\" within the West someplace, although it is seldom exhibited as for example within the continent of Africa.epend upon them for food and medicinal deliveries.

These were non-credit courses for anyone to register for. Foaucault had instigated this arrangement for Boulez,for although Foucault's purview never included in arts especially contemporary music he had a conscious for the art of subversion, of the new, of the intellect, and always thought that music had in fact kept pace with technological innovations more so than the other others.These lectures some have been translated into English available from Contemporary Music Review, Harwood Academic Press.England. Boulez has always been fascinated by the concept, how materials can become to be organized with varying concepts at work, always an infinity for the situation that would yield the most complex, a concept that had in fact the longevity contained in it. Boulez's aesthetic always searches, has searched for the situation that goes by itself, that propells itslef, projects itself within a trajectory that produces a situation for timbre to be explored. The paradigm for Boulez is that many times these concepts, and compositional templates seem to always be light years beyond what the actual results were, which he continually finds himself re-working, re0vising, re-visiting his works. Some he does leave to the vagaries and magnetic forces of history as his elegant enigmatic Third Piano Sonata. Boulez ever since his \\"Boulez on Music Today\\", Darmstadt Lectures, has been fascinated by where a work has freedom and where it constricts. Even when he conducts Mahler for instance he looks for points in melodic phrases that cannot be altered beyond recognition, and those fragments of a phrase that has realtively more freedom, as in Mahler's Sixth Symphony Second Movement.<br /><br />What is discussed here over a period of ten years is the paradigm of timbre, how it has evolved for instance within the orchestra, how certain strains of patrilinear threads exist, as for instance that of Wagner to Berg To Hartmann to Zimmermann to Lachenmann to Rihm.or from Messiaen to Boulez to,Eloy to Dufourt to Manoury. Boulez speaks very specifically on the \\"destiny\\" of timbre and what it needs to continue to nurture itself. He agrees with Lachenmann that timbre needs renewal in some form for it to be kept alive for the present otherwise we merely re-experience what has been, which is why Boulez never savored nor saw fascinations with the various strains of Neo-Movements within music as Stravinsky's Neo-Classic, or Schoenberg's \\"Americanized\\" works when he had escapsed from the Nazis to America shores, or the latest post-modern expressions as Wolfgang Rihm,or the obsessions in American serious music with popular forms.<br /><br />Boulez speaks of his works the \\"Mallarme Improvisations\\" how that work itself was like an odyssey of timbre, and the varying settings of texts from its clearest to its most opaque. There is also the concept of \\"timbral modulation\\" something Stockhausen had explored in his youthful \\"Gruppen fuer drei Orchestre\\" waht Boulez means by it is the slow transformations the gradations of timbre within a musical work,and how this change comes to define the signature of a the work. If you can find these lectures and read French it is well-worth it if you are interested not only in contemporary music but what aesthetic and culture seems to mean.agner to Berg To Hartmann to Zimmermann to Lachenmann to Rihm.or from Messiaen to Boulez to,Eloy to Dufourt to Manoury.

If you need to hide behind an accompnaiment, especially if this is your first time performing John Cage's graphic notational works Cage allows you to utilize an accompaniment from his other works, the \\"Concert for Piano\\" can be used, as well as the various \\"Solos For. . . \\" that can accompany the\\"Conbcert for Piano\\", many have beren used to great success and effect/affect as Solos, as Stuart Dempster on Trombone, or Bertrum Turetsky, as well as countless others. the \\"Aria\\" is written on a number of pages, like a \\"screeen\\", each page, where the reigster is simply given as a continuous wavy lines like a sinusoidal waves, or vibrational waves. Then there is another contiguous line that is coloured, red, blue,green,yellow, each colour can be designated by the performer as a particualt singing or cultural style, as folk, or jazz or various subjectivities, as sensual, or neurotic, or anxiety ridden, or sexually playful, or serious vibrato filled soprano or Basso. What is curious would be to do a statistical study on what is the frequency of styles utilized for each time this piece was performed, I would be happy with say 100 performances, since it was written in the late Fifties. Cathy Berberian the Diva of the Fifties avant-garde was wondrous, did magical things with this work. It can move fairly fast for the perfomer decides how fast each page is perfomred. It cannot be instantaneous for each page contains more than one style to be projected,but as fast as humanly possible to change the timbre of the voice to suggest these changes would be the performative norm.<br /><br />It is a lotta fun I think for you can make the work as serious and complex, and convoluted as you wich, one caveat that performing Cage is not an invitation simply to do whatever you want without a sense that you are in fact playing a piece of music that has a context within the post-war avant-garde, and it does have serious references to the history of 20th Century expression, Marcel Duchamp, Dada, and the post -war, post serial avant-garde, or should we now say post-modernity, since the work has really renuous references to high modernity.<br /><br />You also can utilize the encyclopedic \\"Songbooks\\" of Cage if this \\"Aria\\" has wetted you appetitite and you crave more of this stuff..It can become an obsession for the mere thought of freedom excites the imagination and one's creative consitution, I guess since the freedoms we do have always seem to be mortgaged into the futre, some how in some way, in some reference to post 9/11 reality..invitation simply to do whatever you want without a sense that you are in fact playing a piece of music that has a context within the post-war avant-garde, and it does have serious references to the history of 20th Century expression, Marcel Duchamp, Dada, and the post -war, post serial avant-garde, or should we now say post-modernity, since the work has really renuous references to high modernity. <br /> <br />You also can utilize the encyclopedic \\"Songbooks\\" of Cage if this \\"Aria\\" has wetted you appetitite and you crave more of this stuff..It can become an obsession for the mere thought of freedom excites the imagination and one's creative consitution, I guess since the freedoms we do have always seem to be mortgaged into the futre, some how in some way, in some reference to post 9/11 reality..	2005-02-23

This idea later expanded to full tilt in the longer brutal Second Piano Sonata, and the disintegration of rhythmic, intervallic cells, that come to the surface in great clariy, or come to one as if a lamenting sould looking for nourishment in time,time being like an \\"oxygen\\" for intervals.The Flute Sonatine as well is discussed,cut from the same field as the First Sonata,and we find the excitement of expanded 12 Tone technique and when these works became first published by Amphion,also some discussion on the more rarified air,the dodecaphonic developments in his latter 'structures for two pianos', where electronic timbral thinking was the focus almost the infinite array and distribution of the row, although Boulez saw the reiteration of the 12 Tones to be uninteresting,and simply at times preferred to state only 9 Tones.We learn that Boulez had performed his \\"structures\\" with Yvonne Loriod on tour in Europe.There is a recording as well.<br />The problematics of the interface between electronic sound and acoustic is discussed here as well, like the orchestra, as his 'poesie our pouvoir' (1958) withdrawn \\"Polyphonic X\\" for 18 instruments;it was Stockhausen who really resolved this paradigm and Boulez himself although decades later at IRCAM and the 4X computer systems.<br />Deliege has long been in the Boulez camp writing essays on his music along with Jean-Jacques Nattiez, Dominique Jameaux, Jean Vermeil,and Joan Peyser.<br /><br />The early Boulez aesthetic was quite fascinating,coming from the ravages and cultural freeze of the Second World War. You can say Boulez always developed his own path and did not stay in anyone's shadow for too long,as Messiaen at first, then the dodecaphonic grandfathers as Schoenberg,Webern, Berg,then John Cage, (concepts of the indeterminate, aleatoric)Mallarme-ian and James Joyce orientations in literature then was the citadel where complexity and the \\"unknown\\" began to be explored, as he says in these interviews, and Mallarme's \\"Livre\\" \\"Blue Notebook, a collection of loose pages, of works that can be read in any order was a great bolt of illumination if you place yourself within the context of the Fifties, actually within a culture that was quite conservative on both sides of the Atlantic.So much so that contemporary music was not considered an important vigorous art as then Gaullist cultural Czar Andre Malraux promuligated,someone who should have known better.

There is also encyclpedic like entries on the Grand Auteurs of modernity, Schoenberg, Berg, Webern, Debussy, Ravel, Bartok, and Messiaen.

This became the 'Sketchbook' for the \\"Rite of Spring\\" done into different coloured inks to incourage Stravinsky's compositional process of re-arranging fragments(assemblage) of what he writes.<br /><br />Cage has always been interested in notation for the pure challenge in it,what the line tells you,and in the 1950s, with the demise of serial music,Cage began doing his scores in graphic(s) notation,it was for a sense of linear and conceptual freedom,and the \\"Concert for Piano\\"(circa 1955) being the ultimate encyclopedic magnum citadel for graphics in music. It was not until in (1965-1967) Cornelius Cardew's \\"Treatise\\" where we find a work of similar scope, although for Cardew, \\"Treatise\\",done with impeccable craftsmenship was a score of 193 pages for improvisation, for AMM. For a number of years just about everyone was interested, fascinated by the Question \\"What is Notation?\\" and why do we need to write certain things in certain ways ignoring others. Of course if you simply wrote music without a bend toward the truly innovative,, the experimental strain,there never was a question,there was then the question of how to deal with complexity, which simply grew by leaps and bounds,irresepctive much of the time of the content or meaning, which we can still ponder.<br /><br />This \\"Notations\\" originally published by the Something Else Press, and Dick Higgins (a post-Cage activist,Fluxus maverick)was a contribution to this quest, this Jabes-ian Question. For many the fascination with graphics was in the pre-compositional phases,like creating charts and pitch configurations, arrays,templates and harmony notebooks of intervallic import, mining the depths of the endless almost possibilities, of two-three-four, hexachords, tetra-chords.Today with the aid of the computer and fractal-like thinking this is commonplace. So this book reads like Joyce's \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" in many respects, the \\"Here Comes Everybody, for everbody seems to be here of those cadre within the post-war avant-garde.

The visual arts scene however was an early enthusiastic supporter to this repetitive music,more so than academia or the established concert venues,until it became popular.<br />So the \\"minimal\\" in music slowly made pathways into  establishment venues,opera,and performance art,and it was well-suited with the post-modern canons of the apolitical passivity(only Fredric Rzewski bridged this gap to the political subject) and today it is commonplace,the fashionable circuits mixed with the strains of expression of the popular avant-garde, obsessed with the market and popular culture, the buzz and being loved.<br />Interestingly the structure of this book is divided for this emphasis into Paint, Sound, Space, and Strickland keeps this dialogue intact. So we find such geometrical creations by Donald Judd,identical size boxes descending downward along a wall,or simply cubes of varying shapes or the aluminum,plexi-glass,cubes,boxes situated as for eternity in Marfa Texas, a minimalist shrine in an old Army Base he purchased has no real equivalent in music. Likewise the powerful impersonal spirituality of the florescent lighting schemes of Dan Flavin or the shaped steel plates, and torqued ellipses of Richard Serra or floor covering, and fifty yards long wood planks and floor steel tiles of Carl Andre, not to mention the committed painters as Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, or Bridget Riley. All are here as Sol Le Witt.And again the equivalents in music areless than adequete,it isn't possible to speak of the two fields as sharing a focus.I beleive there are useful equivalents but it is on a case by case basis. I consider the first piece of musical minimalism,around Picasso's time and Stravinsky to be Erik Satie's \\"Vexations, a 9 Hour work of the same thorny quasi-chromatic phrase for piano solo, repeated incessantly at the same tempo or Cage's \\"Etudes Australes\\" a piece of minimalism for its static-ness,even orchestral pieces of Xenakis have a \\"stasis\\" dimension to it,that certainly has a more orthodox affinity for the term than the what became therather surface simplicity,the market concoctions of Glass,,Reich and Adams. These diverse kinds of works(that Strickland doesn't mention) are really never viewed from this perspective.<br />Strickland however keeps his narrative close to this visual world.But as close as one got to vigorously conceived works when all this began in the Seventies was Philip Glass who went by way of opera and that was a good vigorous start to place the minimalist musical canons within establishment venues,with a great structural pallette in place now to test its scope and longevity/ With text, theatre, peformance art and concept all now were burdened within the minimalist context.As important as these in-roads were Glass hadn't the theoretical ambition to nurture its implications further ,so he found facile route the most exciting and lucretive form for minimalism,now with electronification and augmented decible levels,trying to find affinity with the magnetic force of the rock genre/venue to some degree. He then simply fell prey to opera's complaisant seductions relying on tried and tested forms within opera's clostered structural genres, as duets, trios,intrumental interludes as in \\"Aknahten\\", and latter works the one with the simplistic use of the text of Doris Lessing.His works then after the operatic periods simply saw greater exhibitions of minimalist homogenizations of concept,surface flashes, reduced down to its lowest accessible form,without obviously jumping into another genre,as style=lized rock.<br />Where is the affinity for innovation and musical experimentalism? so prevalent in Glass's early ensemble Farfisa Organ works. So minimalism in ascendancy was quickly left to the market to consume it, Hollywood,wealth and power were safe havens for its musical language.And film scores abounded as the \\"Exorcist\\" in parts. Again Strickland adheres to the visual arts in order to buffer a safe zone within it, and to see where the two meet. They never really do,for music is more a collective experience,\\"let's groove together\\" whereas minimalist visual art is never hardly that it is an intense personal experience of contemplation. For these parallels,finding painterly concepts of tone, and gradations of colour distributions are largely useful if you examine the \\"origins\\"  the original repertoire of minimal music, as lesser known composers as the late Terry Jennings and Tom Johnson.  But as time wore on past the Seventies and Eighties minimalism found fewer and fewer similar conceptual and expressive features with the hardcore visual arts and theoretical paradigms of reference. Musical minimalism became homogenized, where even rockers found service in its (now-obvious)percolating rhythmic pulses,as Blondie,Devo,and the Techno studio layering cadres,there is even an \\"elevator music\\" minimalist jazz.The \\"minimal\\" canon in music became simply a reproducible language crossing borders as an oil-slick approaches distant shores. Strickland here thinks these \\"migrations\\" was one of minimalism staying powers, a longevity factor which proves its profound content, when in fact it was part of its dilution and demise into greater forms of homogenizations, and now fodder for least common denominators of expression subjected to it.<br />La Monte Young however,is given good space here, a post-Cage artist long a recluse creator,who found pleasure in listening to telephone generators, and motors, the inherent drones embodied in what we simply refer to as a \\"noise\\" also found an affinity for Just Intonation and the music of the East(as Reich,Riley,Glass) and mounted hours/days long performance of electronic drones, with Marian Zazeela,at blasted decible levels. He however was never a market icon, (no commercial potential as Frank Zappa would say)but in fact came closest toward finding equivalents to the visual arts conceptual world as Strickland searches for here.He did this in the Nine Hour \\"Well-Tuned Piano\\".<br />The concept of the long durational length is something that minimal music should have found from its start, not at the end of its demise. Of course the late Morton Feldman has been a rescuing agent here with his 6 Hour \\"Second String Quartet\\", the various piano solos \\"For Bunita Marcus\\", and \\"Triadic Memories\\", and the hours log \\"For Philip Guston, and \\"For Christian Wolff\\", for Flute and Piano are surely masterworks within musical minimalism. Length by itself is not the component that makes minimal music find itself with its visual arts brethren, no in Feldma's latter works you have also the incessant repetition of music materials, sometimes with self-defeating breaks, as in Feldman, where predictable almost Stravinskian moments come to the surface.<br /><br />I think minimalism ended long ago,it does however still nourishes a pleasure in pure form and space, the \\"miniature\\" work is also a form neglected here.We speak now of a \\"post-minimalism\\" largely represented by the orchestral works and operas of John Adams.

If you take all four praticioners here, to my mind only their early works seem to hold any interest at all,it is only the only works that have a \\"longevity\\" factor, where we can still find points of interests. For it was in the early works that carried the weight into what we have now.<br />Musical minimalism as well is a kind of misnomer in that the term began in the visual arts and if you go there you will find the term and its results and achievments has a much more vigorous base of contemplation and export. There simply is more important things happening there, as Donald Judd,the minimalist shrine of cubes and geometric shapes in an old Army base in Marfa Texas or the flourescent lighting schemes of Dan Flavin, the powerful sculptural plates of Richard Serra,or painters abound as Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella and Bridget Riley. There simply is no comparison with the level of conceptual depth and gestural focus, what art is suppose to do, what it did, and how the concept is engaged,and how it responds to its context and art history,or a temporality (how for instance the spirit, ir-religious of course is engaged in Richard Serra, his plates where the human mind simply stands there engaged in peace with his own existence or sense of space and time). Musical minimalism has no equivalent, and it is a shame for it could have had this. La Monte Young's \\"Well-Tuned Piano\\", a 9 hour work with just intonation tunings of the piano comes close to the temporal vigours of Judd's shrine I beleive.<br />With the introduction of opera in the works of Glass well now we are in another dimension, for Glass resorted to traditional classical structures of opera, duets, trios, quartets, (as in Aknathen) this is no longer innovative means. Potter's book draws light on this paradigm here makes you think of these issues what minimalism did and what it is now. Was it simply a fad?, or did it produce sustainable music?, music we can return to once or twice, or was minimalism simply \\"grist\\" for the mill of the market, one time, make the cash, take the money and run. Again the importance of minimalism is found in its early repertoire, Reich fascinating threadbare music for four woodblocks was all he needed to write to proclaim a status, or Glass's early music with Farfisa organs and saxophones,\\"Music in Fifths\\" or Riley's \\"In C\\", or his \\"Keyboard Studies\\" are all relevant pieces we can return to unpretenciously.<br /><br />The late Morton Feldman is of course not here. He had intense knowledge of the visual arts world and his last works sought to reclaim this paradigm for music (his Second String Quartet, and Triadic Memories, For Chritian Wolff) are works scaling long durational lengths a place where minimalism in music seems to be now a beginning point not an end. Had Feldman lived I think he would have written even longer works. Of course Cage's massive work for organ now being realized in Halberstadt Germany, a work lasting years is also a step in the right direction.light on this paradigm here makes you think of these issues what minimalism did and what it is now.

This is an exhaustive survey of Eisler's work,music,aesthetic and life. David Blake the editor and composer studied with Eisler for a time. Blake also has wonderful essays on Ernst Bloch.<br />Eisler was a marxist activist composer in every respect of the term, he simply worked at whatever the movement and music, the arts needed, and this endeavor was a problematical one even today.<br />He emerged from Vienna and studied with Arnold Schoenberg,and is never really recognized by anyone(other than Schoenberg) as the third great student of the 12 Tone School(Berg and Webern the obvious others).But bourgeois prejudice has made Eisler actually throughout history, an outcast in the new music community. Even Luciano Berio had nothing perceptive to say about Eisler's work,simply that it was too simple. This from a composer (Berio) who found the shortest distances the dilution and homogenizations of the post-serial languages.He is still however deeply respected by the younger generation composers certainly in England Cardew and Skempton, and Smith,and the Germany,composers H.K. Gruber and H. Goebbels.<br />Eisler early had found the thread of politics to music writing pieces and conducting within collective settings as the worker chorus,mass songs(United Front Song)(Forwards)became the focus for this period prior to the rise of fascism, where the ruling classes of the globe did have in fact something to fear, with the system not working, the Depression.<br />With the eradication of the Left,The Nazis had put a price on Eisler's head so he immigrated and remained in the USA living as a film composer in Hollywood.This was a place he found the greatest hypocrisy in the arts.He was only to be deported after the war during the Witch Hunts of the McCarthy era.<br />This collection of essays reveals Eisler not only the composer but the theoretician,of speaking on problems of creativity,history,structure,text and concept. He found himself on Lecture Tours,throughout his life and this process became an integral part of his music, knowing how to speak to people is just as important as writing music.<br />Here included are some of his primary essays that perhaps had more mass appeal \\"On the situation of modern music\\"and \\"On the bourgeois concert business\\". He does have vigorous essays, actually translations of his Lectures on aspects of the sociology of music,on finding the class origins for instance within the history of music,topics seldom discussed even within academia today.Much of this material is still in its original German.He found it a challenge as the essay here by Albrecht Betz\\"Music and politics:theme and variations\\" on the paradigm of tracing the line that exists between outright propaganda and serious music.This became an art in and of itself when you also contemplate Brecht's contribution to poetry and literature, where he discovered new literary genres placing his poetry in forever differing context.Eisler as collaborator with Brecht was certainly influenced by this affinity for the new in terms of the aestjetic and structure.(Betz has his own booklength study of Eisler.)And Eisler never simple took the easy route and maintained a sophisticated sense of the aesthetic throughout his life,even coming to terms with atonality the last years of his life. He did in fact write the most interesting atonal music during his early years,a topic Blake takes up as the \\"First and Second Piano Sonatas\\", and the pieces\\"Zeitungausshnitte\\".Opus 11 \\"Newspapperclippings\\" for Voice and Piano.Eisler had a gift for lyricism and transforming the most arduous text into power,directedness and lilting gentleness. Examples abound as his\\"An den kleinen Radioapparat\\"\\"to my radio\\",the\\" Drei Wiegenlieds\\" \\"Three Lullabys\\",\\"Change the World it Need it!\\". He found irony for instance in the song on the tric(man of the street) soliciting a prostitute,where he interweaves the famous harmonic progression from Wagner's \\"Tristan und Isolde\\", that love can be bought, it is simply another commodity as anything else.<br />Eisler and Brecht being in the forefront of the issues of politics during the pre-and post war times in the arts were frequently the subject of discussion,even Walter Benjamin knew this body of work, and found the genre of \\"mass art\\" to be progressive as Brecht practiced it. Along this line Gunter Mayer provides a chapter \\"Eisler and Adorno\\" a formidable rendering of these issues between committment and marxist mandarin-ism Adorno.Adorno thought that mixing politics and music only cheapened one for the other. That the highest form of subversion was actually the privatized practicing bourgeois artist as recluse,not sacrificing his aesthtic for the market or the street, as Schoenberg,Berg and Webern had admirably done.<br />The great works of Eisler are surveyed,primarily the \\"Songs\\" the \\"Holderlin Fragment\\" is given one chapter by here as well the collaborations with Brecht, \\"Die Mutter\\" \\"Die Massnahme\\", \\"The Hollywood Songbooks\\", and the oratorio-like \\"Deutsche Sinfonie\\", and his last work the opera from 1952 \\"Johann Faustus\\". This last work was like the summary opus a deeply felt commentary on the state of the world after the war, and the opportunism that existed in the East with the Soviet satellites.Here we are provided with the libretto and Eisler's own notes on this work. Eisler when he returned to the DDR , East Germany he was largely ignored by the DDR government hardly mounting performances of his works.<br /><br />There are also heretofore unavailable a translated interview with Hans Bunge where we now see Eisler past his career where he reflects on the politicalization of the arts,the situation in the East and when asked where music and politics renders itself,that all art is political the answer was that it is rather useless to politicize everything.It is rather the artist challenge to find the thread to jump over the border to find where this paradigm exists between politics and music.There is also a wonderful narrative on when Eisler brough Brecht to Schoenberg's home while they all lived in Los Angeles.

We learn he remained afraid to conduct, and cancelled many times,also hated travel, he was very much like his music, thought thru down to finest rarefied details.,plucked strings, pencil-thin harmonics, Am Steg;a new musical language advanced like his \\"Six Pieces Op.6 for Orchestra\\",miniature gems of timbre here/there. There is not much on the creativity moments of his life, this is fairly a personal day to day ad nauseum at times narrative. It is fairly exhaustive, and really brings the commonplace aspects that fills really much of a composer's life, that in fact those moments of \\"illumination\\" or clarvoyance we as consumers continue wish to phanthom occur many times quite spontaneously and never within a durational frame of predictability; while walking or un-boarding a train, lighting up a cigarette, watching the troops from the train, returning home.

Scherchen focuses upon timbral problems, articulation and dynamics,what it means and how certain instruments \\"speak\\" or fail to within certain contexts.<br />The shapes and direction of phrases and musical lines are explored here and it makes you search for similar passages from Beethoven to Stockhausen. The structure of this book is by orchestral familes with an ample amount of real examples, excerpts from primarily classical literature, some excerpts by Hindemith.And I can tell you from experience that there is no shortage of knowledge in learning the unique features of each instrument. You can also accomplish this work from a rich survey of solo unaccompanied literarture. Bach's famous \\"Sonatas and Partitias\\" for solo violin, Berio's numerous \\"Sequenzas\\" would be great places to start.<br /><br />There are no interpretive insights offered here as none can be. Scherchen lets you, he respects one's intelligence to make up your own mind and simply gives you the problem to be resolved and contemplated.<br /><br />Scherchen was a seminal figure for post-war Europe, the new and old where young conductors as the young Pierre Boulez and Bruno Maderna had attended his rehearsals. Scherchen also encouraged young composers to submit works to him for performance. Xenakis tells a story where he had visited Scherchen in his hotel room where he found him covered in the enormous pages of his \\"Metastasis\\" 3 foot by 3 foot (on the bed)	2004-12-06

It's always fascinating why an intellectual might be drawn toward a persona, well here one of the greatest political strategists of the century, the last one. Lenin is not one one can warm up to with the vagaries of history for his succession the monstrous detour from Trotsky to Stalin.<br />Marx yes with his early philosophical searchings of humanism, creating a new science of historical man/woman, and then his work on capital exposing the whys and wherefors for greed, profit,work, distribution and circulation, even Wall Street Sharks find Marx interesting if detestable. But Lenin (so we are told) failed to ignite a revolution that sustained itself, and won, like it is a game of soccer!, the deep complexities of Mother Russia transforming itself after centuries of barbarism was more than formidable.<br /><br />Lenin for Zizek represents a way out of the impasse of the present, the current digitalization and virtualization of reality of the consumer of the culture of un-change,(to have a revolution, you need a revolution)  The neo-liberal order it is clear still requires escape valves the World Bank and the IMF, wars famines,death squads,corruption, massacres, poverty and environmental rape to sustain itself. For there is a man at the end still waiting for surplus value. Lenin's work represents a way out of the impasse of subjectivity of change. Now that deconstruction, and structuralisms, postmodernities vigours haven't produced tangible change we have returned to the Badiou-ian \\"truth-event\\" for which Lenin is a guide to action of sorts.<br /><br />Lenin for Zizek was one who worked his way out of the impasse he always found himself in as best he could, where he bewildered many of this comrades adopting positions few could see the immediate results. Lenin as well had to fall backwards,while in power making compromises with the Western democracies who simply wanted  a reversion to the Czar for starts,then as a pretext to steal Mother Russia for natural and strategic purposes, something a perennial pattern we find now within the Middle East. Also for the burgeoning years of the 20th Century how can we have a functioning communist state,that confiscated the property of the former ruling classes, this revolution stuff might spill over into other industrial powers as it almost did in Germany.<br />The tour de force here is Zizek's essay \\"Repeating Lenin\\", a turgid yet focused theoretical romp into Left iconic history, shibboleths with Hegel and Lacan by his side. Zizek for instance finds affinity with Adorno's \\"Negative Dialectics\\", as another impasse similar to Lenin's \\"Philosophical Notebooks\\" of 1915. Both found themselves working their way through a reality. With Lenin though he assumed completion, the seizure of power, whereas with Adorno he found no way out toward change; cultural political or otherwise.<br /><br />Lenin's primary texts are here reproduced, ones Zizek found useful.ng a perennial pattern we find now within the Middle East.

Music is always behind in theory,in cultural critique, in appraisals of its theoretical implications. Simpy compare the art world in the level of discussion and dialogue with the corridors of serious music, and you will find a large gulf.<br />The Impressionists,the Expressionists eras were over before music caught up with the conceptual trajectories that produced this art.Not that I adhere to strict categorical paralleles for it does have its conceptual limitations.But music seems mired in itself, and it has only bee recently(the last ten years) where we even find writers  finding useful parallels from music to social dimensions, culture or politics.And there is no excuse for it with perceptive writers as Theodor Adorno and Pierre Bourdieu to lead the way. For instance we have musicologists today that are still contemplating the \\"mysterious\\" harmonic schemes of Wagner's prelude to \\"Tristan und Isolde\\",or finding the \\"golden circles through set theory with differeing pitch configurations while in the other arts vigorous fascinating work abound in theory,in concept,in technique in dialogues in discussion of the lifeworld interbreed with philosophy and culture where we may find where the limits of post-modernity reside.<br />So this is a welcome book if only because it helps situate music a realm even the likes of Lyotard and Jameson hardly speak about, or only as generally and opaque as possible.It hasn't been since Jacques Attali(a relative novice in music) where his book \\"Noise\\" we have some all-encompassing subversive, drawing in categories of the economic, production,and composition.<br />So What is post-modern music?,it really doesn't matter anymore, and when it did the various music scholars were silent, or confused, or both. Well musical post-modernity is that where it has given up the torch of modernity and we can even include the gravitas of Boulez and Stockhausen,Cage and Berio into this transgressiveness for they, their music has been, in various ways, bit by the buzz, the fashionable, the accessible,the market even the more serial orthodox compositional extremes of  Brian Ferneyhough has loosened his vigorous grip on his  overdetermined complexity , where rhythms and textures are simpler than ever seen in his oeuvre.<br />For music I guess it was the late Sixties with the rebellions in Europe and campus demonstrations here that seemed to spark something, a democratization of culture, where (as a Cage canon has it) we are all composers. We have now a levelling-down of modernity, modernity made more \\"user=friendly\\". It is much easier to become a composer today in that reading music is no longer a prerequisite, even consummate rocker Elvis Costello can have/write serious music for orchestra today.<br /><br />The tardiness here again here refers to the fact that we no longer use the term post-modernity, we have (according to theorist Hal Foster) long past the post, we are in the era After-Post, and I hope it stops there for nothing is illuminated. The Market, the Glorious Buck controls everything now, serious music is whatever anyone wants to pay for it or produce it, to distribute it, that's todays definition,or guideline also in terms of bourgeois prizes handed to some composers who really (let's face it gents and ladies) really don't deserve it. But that's another trajectory of the bureauocracitization of the avant-garde or music.<br /><br />Some of the essays here are simply general expose of particular composers as Lachenmann and Ferneyhough, but all the more valuable for it helps situate their work within a larger whole. There is quite a number of topics here all worth contemplating as multi-ethnicity,and composition, profiles of composers, how they work. Politics(a forever important realm for the creative artist) seems to have been forsakened here,examining the larger framework of where commissions emanate from,why are artists marginalized (censored really) who gets what, when and How. But that's a small reservation compared to the value of this book.his book.	2004-09-20

Zizek is independent enough (and he knows he's an intellectual supported by the system) where he need not simply fall like sheep into line with the various/nefarious propaganda machines as practiced by The Heritage Fnd.Wm.Kristol,Thom.Freidman, Wm.Safire. They all have easy jobs simply make some nice waverings from Right to Left,Neoliberal is the buzz these days(you needn't be consistent either)summoning the time honored icons of truth,justice,civilization,terror where is it? etc. or in Safire's case simply Right-Wing all the way, no swinging allowed!, there is simply evil out(The \\"Other\\" or today \\"Islam\\"(those who have oil) (it was communism) there to be extinguished or made docile, so the discourse is further made one-dimensional.<br /><br />So let's turn to the real world and that's where Zizek begins. Zizek uses Lacan's conception of reality where what is real is never really really \\"real\\" because it is \\"tainted\\" or \\"diseased\\" with the imaginary and the symbolic. So the line of arguments and facts he follows are always placed within this Lacanian context and it makes for interesting reading.<br />It is fairly commonplace now that Bush and Company always knew that Saddam had no weapons(WMD) otherwise why would Washington send over 150,000 troops ready to be slaughtered by these weapons. (We are talking about, well they, Washington etc. talked about weapons of MASS destruction, what does that mean?) Well weapons that can be sent to New York,intercontinental?It really doesn't matter for the WMD symbolic has been and continues to be grist for the mill of the media and now the Presidential Election.So Zizek is telling us; it is all a distraction from the real issues.And he here clearly sees it's all propaganda, and summons the \\"borrowed kettle\\" story from Freud as a means of identifying the \\"missing\\" component here.<br />As the book progresses(For Iraq is only  the first part) there is/are some nice dialogues between pure theory, Lacan,Hegel and real facts, here, and Zizek is simply doing the intellectuals job relating philosophy and culture, politics to the reality,or \\"reality\\" which is now, or was \\"now\\".of identifying the \\"missing\\" component here.

Shame these essays and interviews are no longer available or difficult to obtain.<br />Feldman has, or had many interests verging converging in all directions but all of it seems to have served, to have nurtured his music, and his thinking about the various nefarious processes that music allows one,memory, timbre, texture, register,and finally long durational lengths and rhythm. All this was  the lifeworld that challenges the work ethic,sitting down everyday at a table, with pen, to organize oneself is perhaps just as important as what one writes, for we learn the process itself determines the results. Feldman  said that one day he would write, and if it went well, the next day he would copy the  one page of many yet to write in final form in some indelible ink.<br />Feldman has much to say about working, that for instance he wrote at the piano to try things out, this it turns out slowed him down, you needed to think before you wrote. Also he utilized indelible inks that simply one could not erase easily, unless the page of score was cut with a pen-razor knife.<br /><br />Walter Zimmermann had interviewed Feldman, this was a time(the early Eighties) when Zimmermann himself was evaluating his own work in composition, what musical language one may might adopt.<br /><br />Feldman studied composition with Stefan Wolpe yet was schooled within the mileau of the Abstract Expressionists in New York, where they hung out at the Cedar Bar in New York City speaking about all things commonplace, as density, texture, shape and design of abstraction, also working and process, how does one learn again and again when something is already learned (as for instance drip painting or field colours, largeness and scale, what now does one do to further the process along. Feldman would often accompany painters to other studios to see new creations/directions art was(or did) take. Usually friend painter Philp Guston said when examining a work, \\". . . . yes overall it doesn't work, but this moment here (gesturing to the lower right quadrant of the painting) is pure genius.\\"<br /><br />Feldman had challenged himself constantly with new forms new musical shapes in genre, he simply titled his work , :Durations: or:Music for, , , or named it after a friend, or simply :piano piece\\", then simplified still \\"piano\\". But he did break this with more dramatic titles as \\"The King of Denmark\\", a wonderful graphic piece (in numbers) piece for solo percussionist who must play the instruments his/er choice with knuckles and fingers only.<br /><br />These interviews are well-endowed with selected pages from Feldman's music yet they stop prior to the large scale works the last ten years of his life as the String Quartet, the 6-Hour work, and \\"For Christian Wolff\\", the 4 Hour flute and Piano work.I find this late period rather dismal and not thought through enough, enamored over theso-called rhythmic discoveries of Phil Glass. Feldman had a wider pallette to manipulate and survey, he had a deeper understanding of \\"what works\\" in timbre in density in register. He had no feel for the market and the cash box as Glass surely did with his repetitive rhythmic harmonic formulaic dribble.<br />Feldman also speaks here of how memory works and Henri Bergson, how the mind retains \\"data\\", or music, what happens to a musical idea before and after it is transformed and within the context of what surrounds it and itself., during as well, and how all this affects the \\"composition\\" of how we remember music, their/its events and gestures. Although Fedlamn did not think of his music as gesture, simply relationships of timbres and intervals where they reside for how long what comes before and after. He sought real unadorned beauty of the aesthetic object, something that set him quite apart from his indeterminate innovative brethren as John Cage, Earle Brown and Christian Wolff, unofficialy referred to as the Cage School. Well Cage had the drive, Feldman tells us he knew how to organize and event send out :mailers:, and postcards, schedule rehearsals and the performance space. Coordinate the logistics of what is needed, as say four pianos, or simply a string quartet.chedule rehearsals and the performance space.

Richter was a fabulous deep thinking pianist,he knew how to tame/channel his emotions,serving the music but this lifeworld complexity hardly comes through between-th-lines for he was not a writer.If you are a performing musician you can finish Richter's thought. We cannot be all things to all people.<br />He reports on concerts, his own and recordings,his own(largely he was always displeased) The incredible scope of his career,traveling much after 1960 spanning decades,living through the darkest pages of Soviet Russia, all this comes through his directly functional words. His power as pianist was not forcing his career, allowing himself time to develop a repertoire and more importantly reflect upon it.His first teacher Neuhaus said his tone was brittle, to concentrated, it needed to \\"breath\\" more, and he learned this.His Schubert for example(a \\"breathing\\" composer) was come to very late, as the G major Sonata that befuddles many pianists. There is no substitute for what time and duration does to one's playing, this is something hardly ever learned by cigar-chomping agents. Make a quick Buck! Hell with interpretation and Hell! with music as it should be.<br />Richter had incredible power as a pianist, many conductors will reveal how he can consume the work,as Gennady Rozhdestvensky will reveal. The orchestra must hold its own, as in the Brahms Bb Concerto, or Tchaikovsky.Although Richter to my own ears, only found great interpretive conviction in Rachmaninov and Prokofiev, two composers he felt were very close to each other, and to himself. (although Prokofiev would never openly admit this. Scriabin and Chopin as well Richter had great strength under the surface ornamentations,extended colouful harmonies and brooding darknesses.<br />He claimed he only practiced three hours a day unless he was given a work to learn quickly as Prokoviev did with his late Sonatas. But given Richter's incredible memory I doubt this.<br />There is chronolgy(almost day to day) of Richter's life beginning in 1970 given here in concerts.<br />There are also nice vintage photos of his travels.Prokoviev did with his late Sonatas.

His primary orientation is that the percussive world and any discussion of it has been through social filters,\\"imported\\" concepts from academia that not always shares such dimensions of illumination. By introducing such diverse concepts as Althusseur's \\"interpellation\\"(cross-referencial disciplines rather than one seminal kernel) and Adorno's theory of the demise of content within an administered world Mowitt finds a wholly unique approach here making sense out of senseless beating. So the \\"percussive field\\" is like a special preserve and then treated very much like a pure language to itself. The relative cloistered universe of musical academia has seen little use for such social and political dimensions; whereas Mowitt confronts these cognitive material aspects directly.<br />He begins with the idea that music in particular percussion music(beating, striking, banging) can be and is/implies a coherent language that is rooted in a \\"socialness\\" and has a unique discourse of representation. Percussion music recall has been a special preserve for innovation as the early 1930s works of composer Edgar Varese later John Cage. In fact one can usually determine if a composer, a creator understands timbre strictly from the sensitivity to percussive timbre. It seems to be the last dimension within any musical oeuvre that develops.<br />Interestingly Mowitt refers to our primordial forms of the aesthetic of tribes beating on their/Our bodies. And there is a wealth of timbre from the body, filled with or unfilled with cavities, resonating \\"boxes\\". He is quite well-read and draws many fascinating pathways not only into World music but Popular culture, Chuck Berry. And examines how the \\"beat, the backbeat as in \\"Get Off My Cloud\\" by the Rolling Stones. He seems to imply that the beat has all the necessary language and subversion we often miss.  We need to get away from the market tyranny of contemplating music, of placing music into a pre-determined set and serial means of styles and genres.

The buzz of Slavoj Zizek is eminently important, fascinating and politcally useful within today's cultural force fields at work. Zizek has found a combustible energy between philosophy and the omnipresence(largely Hegel) and psychoanalysis(Jacques Lacan forever).\\"We love you Jacques. . . \\" So whether he speaks/writes about \\"The Matrix\\"(Loaded or Not-Loaded), or Kieslowski's \\"Decalogue\\",Hitchcock, Lenin, Christianity, cyberspace, junkspace or other competitors,(quite recently) as the late Deleuze of currently Alain Badiou, Zizek locates his triggering points in how objects are pitted against the real and can delude us and seem important, like a prostitute's gaze/or flick of the eye toward her prospective john. So fantasy becomes one place for focus and popular culture abounds in the fetish of the Cult,what is marketable(another pathway into Marx),and one of Zizek's most fertile breeding grounds where his work has spawned and is chocked filled with objects to discuss as they are hardened against the death-drive, the end of time as we know it, the Buzz turned Off. So we,(our culture,our objects) become in a state of \\"acceleration\\" as Virilio(within another context) has referred to as the \\"dromos\\",the \\"running or race\\".<br />The Real, The Imaginary, and the Symbolic are three cyclical/ellipitical Lacanian icons of discourse that forever revolves within Zizek's thought,be it politics of culture,or cyberspace and consequently ours. For the Real, is Real(real) wherever it may interface with the human object.<br />This is an utterly useful book, a virtuosity of intellectual thought/,creating a capsule like profile of such a formidible thinker, explaining his vast philosophic Helegelian energies expanding over 20 years of Zizek's work.  Kay knows how to break apart/and impeccibly analyze Zizek's vast edifice.She touches on all his primary texts,most of which are far from breeze-easy reading.In that there is always a synthesis, a coagulative process at work finding Hegel in cyberspace or Lacan in Hitchcock, or truth in Lenin. But she defends this endeavor as well worth a flatter, the exepnditure of time. Zizek is a livily impassioned speaker,often throwing wonderful jokes, quips,shibboleths, incidentals, and dirty humour into the texture of his thought written or spoken.Kay's remarkable job here is locating points of developmental alchemy and longevity within Zizek.<br />Zizek having experienced first-hand the break-up of the Soviet empire/ satellites, Zizek has been an important instigator/speaker toward committment into the ethics and the political, Desiring(as I understand here) a Marxism without Marx, and a Lenin without anyone. Lenin? Ethics? Now, What For?  The fascination here is magnetized toward points of hardened committment,vision,cohesion,agenda something quite rare within After-postmodernity hopscoth ontology. In that we(our cognitive faculties,our cultural products)seem to move/mulitply/accrete (and die) at such great speeds. Lenin(in Zizek's eyes) had vision for success, The Revolution. This is given meaning further with his recent fascination with Paulist Christianity,Belief and the work of Alain Badiou, a philosopher who has been reconstructing the philosophic edifice,perceptive pieces from the French deconstructive,(In that Derrida can only summon the complaisance of Marxian \\"ghosts\\" as explaining reality Now)and virtuosic post- structuralists(Baudrillard,Lyotard)both representing a kind of escapism of the past three decades.Badiou has been useful for Zizek in the search for the truth \\"event\\", that truth never finds itself impacted within a system, but truth always is determined by its past, a point Zizek finds worth developing.<br />Kay quite clearly brings a forward looking narrative to this in Zizek's forever search at expansion from the kernel of Hegel/Lacan/Marx.There is also a useful Glossary of terms.cyberspace or Lacan in Hitchcock, or truth in Lenin.

It was Foucault who in a onetime interview with Pierre Boulez had remarked how music has kept pace with the innovations in technology;Spectral harmonics at IRCAM,Just Intonation in the USA and I'd imagine not only innovation but subversion of concept would be great spots to transcend Foucault.For I find this(for Foucault it is our loss that music was not a realm he ever pursued,only as a spot of culture,the radical aesthetic and the end of man, where is he/she) a double entendre/ side here to this for technology does create obscurity as well The most exciting composers have been those who have continually challenged the traditions of reigning ideologies(the 18th and 19th Centuries) or the circumventing the magnetic attractions of the cash box(our own age)after the eclipse of modernity.Those who simply conspire to write serious music masquerading as film music(minimalism included) will be forgotten. All the John Williams's,countless permutations now by 2002,Phil Glass Clones out there will join the 747s in the Mojave Desert standing baking in the sun, bleached for Road Warrior to one day find.<br />I suppose Lacan would have or Zizek would find now something fascinating to say with the indulgences in today's new music,what is it, what does it represent, what incomplete dimension of your unconscious does it reside in.<br />Perhaps music creativity existing within the realms of the modernist language,post-Ferneyhough is harboring an aesthetic in exile,afraid to come out of its embattled neglected shell, like the intimacy of a Dutch lens grinder,a forgotten art.<br />Today it is actually more interesting, at least with new music, to discover the creative pathways of a work than the actual work itself,like an elaborate dinner setting where the food never comes(John Tilbury,pianist said that on radio) a new work for much of the time under-rehearsed,and played once,perhaps twice never to be heard again, and never recorded for consumption. And then there are primary new works  which the citizens of a free democracy never get to hear at all. This the cause of cultural marginalization, we simply never hear some aspects of the creative spirit,even though the Silicon Valley has fashioned a saturation point of image,icon,aesthetic and place. Someone, some human body politically does decide who will get a Pulitzer,or what new premiere work the Chicago Symphony will play this year. In fact we seldom remember the Pulitzer winner's actual prize music,Can you name the work or even remember a moment from it??we listen more to the opaque cultural power a Prize represents, who cares about the music.Well Habermas said opacity\\"Undurchsichtlichkeit\\" is what this age is all about, New Age complaisance.<br />Carter has received numerous prizes but for his body of work the prizes seem to be arbitrary and marginal, we forget them because he has so many of them,like Oscars,who ever has more than one we forget about. We go(should go) directly toward the creative vigours structural or otherwise to the music, its incessant shapes, and convoluted designs,its virtuosic displays and its long range topologies of poly rhythms and other global durational frames.<br />The Harmony Book here, (actually Two Volumes sewed into one here)began as a fairly modest endeavor, a practical accounting means, a way to remember certain configurations of tones, or intervallic transformations. No one can remember everything, so Carter began making these large 14 inch long sheets of these tones. All of this creative odyssey is retold within the interview with scholar John F. Link, who has devoted his analytic work to Carter's polyrhythms,and also this Harmony Book.A wonderful interview here with Carter. Volume One is a Catalogue/Synthesis of three note, four note, five note etc chords, and their tranpostions. It seems easier to contemplate these chords here as 1+2=3, or 3+2=5, for one isolated tone then followed by 2 more tones can powerfully direct the best,evocative,crisis momentsin music, anyones.. This becomes especially relevant when one needs to account for 55 six note chords distribute graciously over the durations of a work,or controlling the succession of 80 or 90 tones followed, staggered, accelerated as the work's discourse unfolds. Volume 2 then is Analysis, a means of looking more deeply into the relationships of all this stuff, the tones, the intervals, the chords. There are moments of pure illumination as in the discussion on Carter's provocative/evocative Night Fantasies or when for instance one learns as in Carter's Third String Quartet, a work shaped by the Duets,One Violin with Viola, One Violin then with Cello, One group more stationary reduced to Five tones, the other Duet ensemble is free to explore all interval rows. I can't help thinking this is how international capital functions,in Argentina, in South Korea in today's neo-liberal mileau.<br />There are also elaborate yet functional means of simple symbols, as a four note chord represented with a box, four point, then five note pentagon, and six, then what is referred to as the Sigla controlling and defining the entire array of tones,220 intervals and chords with all their additions.... There is a Glossary to help one wade through this fascinating Naming of the Father- game.<br />There are also nice excerpts from Carter's music that helps embellish a point,much like conceptual menus for creativity. Then there is the dimension as to who or what controls whom. Does one need this Harmony Book to decepher the structural complexity within Carter's oeuvre. Does Carter need his own Book? And the answer is sometimes! for Carter said that he did break the tyranny of these alloted configurations simply to make the music more interesting.

His work remains amongst/ within the safe,complaisant corridors of escapist realms. He encouraged throughout his life,gently, cadre's of creators, all brilliant,provocative, interesting, and thought provoking, with a utopian flair to change the world.But to change what? Yet there is a grotesquely large gulf between these realms, opaque boundless chasms of artistic creations, notebooks, concepetual art, performance art, all spawned from the Cage Zen inspired pacifist anarchy.Yet what has this work changed as fascinanting as it remains???<br />It has been well known that the great anarchist thinkers that Cage utilizes here as Mikail Bakunin, Petr Kroputkin, and Murray Bookhin in the 20th Century hardly proved to mount  pathways worth pursuing.They indulged in corrupt opportunists politics as those they criticized, as Kroputkin's affair with double dealings.And Bakunin spent most of his life in the Czar prisons. When he was released this rendered him a humble repenting pacifist inwardly. All their work simply remains as Cage's as fascinating, interesting, arresting probes,improvisations into history the 19th and 20 Centuries as a conceptual canvas, with an unreality for the utopian mind.<br />But the world still needs reform and correction,and change,there still is poverty, and malnutrition, and genocide, and corruption, and now more than ever with the turn within world politics after September 11 to Rightward magnetic attractions,with the reoccuring collapse of national currencies,(as Argentina, Brazil, South Korea)tied as a tyranny tied to the American Dollar$$ add to that the new face of corporate corruptions, as Enron which are coming more to the surface for the populace in the face of ever more speculative global capital greed within the financial world. In this light the plight and pursuit of anarchy seems infantile, accelerated to even more escapist self-indulgent, realms as Cage encourages.<br />There are some facinating moments in Cage's \\"Anarchy\\" here the very process of \\"reading\\" \\"interpreting\\" his mesostics, is a sense of the humanly performative, something we haven't lost the capacity for. Yet this is a self-absorbed endeavor, self-referential and need I say deeply masterbatory, hardly emancipatory in content.<br />We've lived admirably attentively through the revolution of the aesthetic,the conceptual, the Duchamp universe wrought with the carnage of the First World War,the Surrealists and made more transgressive,andirrational with the Second.<br />The Cage conceptual creative edifice was never one to gaze outward at this negative,odious impalletable world, Cage's creative magnetic fields were always one of a distant opaque, unexplainable future, made ever more distant and unreachable with each new work, further setting the light at the end of the tunnel ever further out of reach of humanity.age encourages.<br />There are some facinating moments in Cage's \\"Anarchy\\" here the very process of \\"reading\\" \\"interpreting\\" his mesostics, is a sense of the humanly performative, something we haven't lost the capacity for.

Well written by a cadre of Dutch composers and musicians, scholars in their own right who know this music first hand and situate this creativity within a context.<br />I was primarily interested in the post war generation, creators, like Louis Andreissen, Peter Schat, Robert Heppener, Theo Loevendie and Willem Breuker, Maarten Altena,Klaas de Vries, Ton de Leeuw composers you may already know, perhaps not, and whom I've heard of in passing but never was able to get a strong historical fix on their work.<br /><br />Caveat emptor, Dutch composers have been around for some time, quite interesting with neat, multi-voiced theories on how music is to unfold, as Benedictus a Sancto Josepho (Buns) for short is here lived from 1640 to December 1716. If you do not scour the Groves Encyclopedia, you will never know of this Dutch antiquity. It's facinating the musical creative theories we never seem to confront and understand. This book is a helpful guide in this respect.<br />Each composer's profile is followed admirably comprehensively by a list of 'Compositions' all in generic order(I found a shortage of piano solos, since the Maastricht Treaty, and further back) a 'Bibliography' (mostly Dutch references, so you need to be conversant there) and a 'Discography'.<br />You will find the Dutch fascinating,compelling, engaging, theoretical, playfull, severe,transgressive,passive, opportunists, and tepid and flaming revolutionists of sorts (when it was fashionable to be so) in all genres, particularly their postmodernist utilization of popular genres, as jazz, like the multi-tiered collective democratic Orkest de Volharding, a lean and mean Woody Herman mixed with Luciano Berio timbres, and the high energy of post war European youth.<br />The Dutch are fantastic improvisors as the Willem Breuker Kollektief manifests,Breuker largely self taught who hated to practice, rather found the language of improvisation to be a path bearing fruit.He wrote much music for film and theatre which has been another vigorous genre for the Dutch. They know where the corridors, the paths to money resides.And getting away from the setting of Brecht texts was an escape into making money. Improvisors actually became in great abundance, a Marxian surplus in The Netherlands after the Bretton Woods Treaty being eradicated, the time of new Anti-Vietnam demonstrations and liberalism with anarchist tinges which took root over the Western democracies as Holland.You will find no shortage of Dutch virtuosi as(also Bass Clarinetist Harry Spaarney). It's a form of escapism from politics, which after the revolution was over New Complexity Populism took Dutch Roots.<br />Well written arrangements of or original compositions was a focus for various improvisor collectives, many of which have now vanished and have eradicated their original semi-anarchist affinities.

The entire edifice of European thought however is traversed here, and I can see the frustration of the other reviews here of more predictable vacuous Marxist bashing.<br />Negri and Hardt are purely conceptual here.In contrast I recommend &quot;Global Gable&quot; by Peter Gowan, as a work more encompassing with technical economically focused yet dealing with identical issues of the reigning imperial power,USA.<br />There are many brilliant insights here however on the breakthroughs in Western thought, of Hegel, Kant, Descartes, but this was more for student usage, than forming a context for discussion on how for instances Gowan's work brilliantly does,that the American dollar (since the end of Bretton Woods)is responsible for the great waves and pendulums of financial collapse, the reoccuring economic pilferage of other countries.And how the USA through the World Bank and the IMF restructure other economies through devaluations of currencies,allowing venture capitalists greater freedoms,and greater ownership in foreign corporations. Hardt and Negri seem to imply this discussion rather than come directly in confrontation with it.<br />There is also good contexts rendered on modernity, and the post formations, but again it is a beginning point not an explanation of what remains the dangers for the citizens of the globe downstream.	2002-01-04

He indentifies the formative powerful figure of Stefan Wolpe, a student of Anton Webern who was the first to introduce the dodecaphonic language into Israel. What is clear when reading these 20 interviews are the unending search for identity and a functional musical language. Paul Ben-Haim is, has been an influential figure of the &quot;Mediterranean School&quot; in Israel,a relatively facile tonal language with the influx of differing folk and melodic utilizations.Yet there is ever bit a set of creative problematics with tonality as dodecaphonic musical language.This tonality had dominated the musical language of creators in the Thirties and Forties,prior to the War of Independence.<br />What is clear as revealed in yet another fascinating interview of Ami Maayani,is that Israeli composers all bloom and develop late,in that their military service interrupts creativity. So it is well not until one is close to 30 years of age,where anything like a career in writing music is even considered. Maayani offers a wealth of advice,that a musician, as himself, is, was not ready, mature enough to write music. That composition should come at the end of one's musical life. Many of today's composers, he goes on to say, only want to be recognized as a composer, not knowing anything of the creative lifeworld,hardly knowing the tools,techniques,and history of the achievements of modernity for instance.<br />We find that musical education as well does not take place entirely within Israeli institutions, as Betty Olivero,who had lived in the United States for a time, and later also spending time studying composition with Luciano Berio, by invitation.She has been a great inspiration of pursuing the modernist language, that of extended instrumental techniques,fusing it sometimes with her native folk heritage imagery.<br />There also seems to be an above-ground compositional railroad that leads to the University of Pennsylvania. Where composer/creators as Yinam Leef come to study with dodecaphonist Richard Wernick and or timbralist/miniaturist George Crumb.<br />There are wonderful excerpts of works given as well, as Tzvi Avni's &quot;Piano Sonata #2&quot;,or Arik Shapira's &quot;Missa Viva&quot;,and a healthy bibliography and a handsome list of relative works for each of the 20 composers.

There is a premonition, a harbinger which had marked Babbitt's life, being the first American to welcome Arnold Schoenberg as he arrived from exile,escaping the darkest pages of European history with the then popularity of the fascists in Europe and some cults within the USA,as Father Cooglan, and then Senator McCarthy and Roy Cohn's dithyrambic Purges of left minded American workers.<br />Andrew Mead does an admirable job, tracing the vast diapasonal musical creations of Babbitt.<br />Mead admirably divides Babbitt's creativity into useful periods, ones marked with a penchant for theoretical discursis,an elan for the pure structural and durational devices his inventive mind had. It all begins with Schoenberg's evolutionary 12 Tone language,which Babbitt had devloped into further functional divisions of the almost Kabballah like power of the number 12. His Composition for Four Instruments, Flute, Clarinet, Violin and Cello was a primary achievement, although rhythmically tthis period was marked by a persistent provincialism of the parameter of rhythm.It wasb't until the Second String Quartet where such tactile parametric freedoms begin to reveal themselves in an effulgence language.. With the Third creative period Mead identifies here the years 1961 to 1980 we impart ourselves in stil greater expansive dimensions. A number of piano solo works distinguish this period, the &quot;Post-Partitions&quot;, and a work I deeply admire the rather modest 'Sextets', for Violin and Piano from 1966,and a revistation of the genre in &quot;Joy of more Sextets&quot; from the  displaying the hexachordal-like encysted divisions between both contrasting instruments. There the genre,of Violin and Piano,which emanates from the 19th Century Sonata, was truly redefined discovering newer contexts, within the predictable structure of duet. Babbitt had also developed theories which now aimed to consolidate the vagaries of the infinite permutations and combinatorial mixtures of the 12 tones,his More Phonemena was a summation piece. I am still thrilled by the Piano Concerto a work in the Eighties, where now we see a freer utilizsation of some of these theoretical achievements. He still maintained this penchant for discovering differing contexts for predictable musical genres,and interestingly pursued interesting combinations as the various 'Soli e Duettini', as the one for two acoustic guitars.covering newer contexts, within the predictable structure of duet.

This almost godlike,well more rocklike stature has diminished,from the days he was imprisoned and tortured by the corrupted Greek Junta who had seized power in Greece in the late Sixties,but Theodorakis has written some of the most powerful comprehensive and culturally penetrating music of the/our age.<br />This book admirably brings all that together,allowing for the primary flaw that it only covers his life to 1980, eleminating his appointment to the Greek Parliament under the more liberal designs of Papandriou. Theodorakis found himself resigning from this position opting to live off his song writing wealth in the more fashionable arrondisements in Paris.<br />Holst does a great job discussing Theordorakis craft of songwriting with ample excerpts. There is less on his Symphonies, many of which were written in the period preceding this book anyway. But there is also a good list of his works,within the classical vein, the numerous Song Cycles,Ballets, Theatre and Film Music. Oh Yes he wrote the music for Zorba The Greek, &quot;Z&quot;, and Serpico, and the Olympic Anthem.	2001-09-10

The musical world is notorious for this social/cultural fragmentation.<br />I suppose George Lewis,who doesn't now live in Chicago represents the Midwest since his long time,'lontano' long ago association as a kid with Chicago's own AACM. Well that don't cut it.There are other in Chicago who contribute greatly to the scene as the CUBE Ensemble,and Chicago free improvisors. I guess we should get our own promo book.<br />Garland,Ochs,Rosenboom represents the West Coast, Yeah I guess!&lt;I'm just waxin negative, but there's some useful stufffff here; as Francis Marie Uitti's sketches on double stops for the violoncello possibilities,not much,how bout Franny tell us about the difficultuies in playing Cage or Scelsi,it's stuffff like that, where you learn, wish there was more of this,<br />Bill Frisell offered renderings on different guitar fingerings was useful, although quite brief,like something he wrote on the bus on the way to the Gig.Likewise Guy Klucevek,Accordeonist/composer as well added some notes,real music notes,I never read anything he wrote,but again something on timbral poossibilities of the Squeeze Box for composers might have been incredibly useful. and,pianists S.Drury and Marilyn Crispell should of talked more about how they play,they play great!, and varied,I'd like to know in print what excites? them why they choose the music they do?, Yes we all know why they choose it, but a little explanation for us unwashed- dispossessed out here who pluck down our Bucks to buy the stuff would have been helpful, a little.<br /><br />Larry Orchs of Rova Sax Quartet, gets into it, ya might think its pedantic to give licks, noodles and fragments of it, as he does but its a world of use,I sat down ans played all of it, loved it.<br />Some get into philosophy and the results are abysmal like David Rosenboom's shibboleths,too much science sometimes is a bad thing, and he's a great contributer to the electronic thinking of music,computer base pieces,But I'd rather read Kristeva,Derrida,Baudrillard,or Habermas on the Public Sphere if I wanted to read philosphy.But there was a practical side to his essay on the idea of propositional music.<br />A bit more useful was Miya Masaoka &quot;Notes from a Trans-Cultural Diary&quot;. Since the real operative term is multi-culturalism not postmodernity, this was infinitely useful to read other persepctives, and means of performing and improvising with non-Western instruments.<br /><br />The most political here was Pauline Oliveros's Questions answered by David Mahler, on how we all survive??, what our music is suppose to do???, how happy are we with the results??, who listens to our stuff?, all this throws quite directly the political question into the discursive/dialogue mix. Whom do we Serve? I believe Rzewski asked many many years ago.<br />There's also some neat goin exegetical excursions into the real sound timbre experience as Elliott Sharp's CARBONic History, Hey man whatever floats yer boat.<br />I know it's easy/facile playing 'Monday Morning Quarterback-Composer', But there was nothing on the Voice,Diamanda Galas,or Anna Homler,or Carol Genetti,should have written,scribbled something for this.<br />Peter Garland,the man of the Desert, is always interesting to read, another who has the guts of throwing the political question into the mix. Since Mickey Mouse and Bill Gates won the Revolution, he has some great stuff to say.<br />I think there should be more writing like this,no matter what the price, Again the greatest observations of Oliveros is that the avant-garde should serve itself first, we should all help each other work at each other's music,Yeah Right!

We live under the force fields of an overabundance of musical styles, where the popular strains seem to be like an oil slick that has touched every shore now,that of the consonant triad.Peter Schat is the Man for this to step in and make sense out of this hyperreal reality which has masqueraded as music throughout the world. He himself has practiced every style and musical language known to man, and believes and we can all rightly agree that there has been a persistent fall, a transgressiveness in the art of composition, where we have multiple Copy Cats of All, with plenty of Neo's thrown in the mix to render a kinda conceptual pseudo sustenance, so we have Neo-Expressionists of various sorts, Wolfgang Rihm, Brian Ferneyhough, even Elliott Carter.Of course the market luvs plurality for now it can cash in on everyone, and the fragmentariness of the styles pulverized and multipled over the globe. These terms, as Neo this, are for discussion only and I hate utilizing all these false terms but they do point to a concpetual concretion, a frequency, a reiteration of the musics materials, if you, for example, persistently utilize dissonance as natural to you as shaving then you're an expressionist, likewise if you tend to desire never to change the chord, or fairly infrequently and are enamored over consonant sounding timbres, as open Fifths and Fourths, witrh percolator like rhythms bouncing below, well these features are smatterings of a stout upstanding minimalist, with all due respect to the serious practicioners of all credos. In steps Peter Schat who beleives he can run a pathway uniting both worlds, the Consonance-ites, and the Dissonance-ites,making sense of the vagaries of post modernities extended distended excesses, and he does so admirably with his concept of the Tone Clock. What is the Tone Clock??. It is a way of appraising and utilizing chords, striking a profound resonance(no pun hardly)with our harmonic grandfather Jean Phillipe Rameau around the middle of the 1700s. The Tone Clock's(plural) premise is for instance any three different notes can and may consititute a triad, a three note chord, not simply the 'louis louie' of c,e,g, moving to f,a,c,constitution, but dissonance unified with consonance,in a fairly rational manner, for instance c, c# and d are a legitimate triad. Then scales can be created from these configurations and one is off the the races writing seriously profound music.Does this take the fun outta writing music, I guess so because you need to follow this book, and absorb Schat's trhinking which is fairly straightforward. Schat beleives however that anyone, any persuasion can utilize the Tone Clock and he has done so himself in his interactive opera, 'The monkey subdues the White Bone Demon'.

While in residence flying over Australia this inspiration seized control, something from an image from(borrowed) of Heiddeger, of capturing the essence of ancient man,his/her rites of passage,the complexity that is at the center of culture. We find this thinking in Finnissy's music,(more the chamber and solo works) dare I say all of it, not only the piano solo sets and myriad numbers solos, and fascinating transcriptions,arrangements we(one) would find.There is always some fascinating cross handed plan at work in his music, like in the piano solo JAZZ, where he had utilized Beethoven's Bagatellen scheme as like a cantus firmus. It seems Finnissy's creativity knows no boundery markings, he strongly pursues his complex craft, well past what others would die gasping for oxygen within the quagmire of daily compositional tasks. Ian Pace who has performed his music countless times, the Piano Concerti (Seven of them) writes on the piano solo music, beginning at the beginning. The Englishness surveyed and scoured in the English Country Tunes was a delight, to finally focus on each piece. I've heard the recording, Finnissy's music is difficult to bare if you don't have the conceptual frame, In fact knowing the work's impetus is a pre-requisite toward its full cognitive experience. I cannot ad much more than the previous reviewer on basic descriptions of this book. It's always of great interest to read orchestral discussions which Julian Anderson does so well, in basic descriptions of the finctions,timbre,shape,and contour of Finnissy's more advanced scores as Red Earth, and Offshore, and Eph-phatha complete with scale utilizations of the latter.<br />A conversational like interview with most of the writers precedes the chapters body. There he discusses such topics as &quot;living in England&quot; &quot;Folk&quot; as in music, his use of it.Also &quot;Working Methods&quot;,this I found there could have been more technical displays of numbers of drafts per work, when is a work complete, or you feel it is,basic items of this lifeworld as what pen, and ink and paper is utilzed makes for interesting reading for us, out here. and basic fare as &quot;Education&quot;.he chapters body.

It(talking about music) should inform you on the work's profound dimension,why it's unique, why it breaks the rules or doesn't, why its interesting above all,or more honest I love critics who are honest, admitting a certain part of the work is not fully understood, Only Stalin was infallible I beleive.If the earth doesn't yield to the work of Soviet construction then the earth is counter revolutionary.Talking about music describing such profundities it contains should be framed in interesting language,that;s not asking much,not Joyce,Kafka,Frost,Kingslover,Camus,Grass, Walcott,but at least something beyond what I find in Steinberg's overly labored tedious, and provincial descriptions. Like the Ligeti Cello Concerto where we get an inch by inch,step by step, foot by foot description this in place of what makes the work tick, its musical functions, does it have counterpoint, and if not, Why Not ?, orchestrations are always given in the beginning of each entry here, but comment on how a unique orchestration may work, its balance, what sticks out, and why,or if not, tell us why not?,Steinberg proceeds something like this: the concerto begins barely audible then when you think you hear a sound the Concerto begins, the work slowly ascends until we reach an E note, but that's not the highest note of the work, On and On, how interesting would you find a similar description, someone driving a car if you had described it to someone, in this way, &quot;I got into the car, I opened the door first, then I found my keys, then I placed my hands on the steering wheel, then I fumbled for my keys, then I put the keys into the ignition,but it didn't torun over right away then I saw someone pass on the street that looked like my old girlfriend, Isn't this pure torture???!!, well Music I feel is a much more interesting subject than a Lexus, there are more aesthetic features to describe as texture, or shape,rhythmic architecture, or melodic design, or timbre, especially in Ligeti where timbre is a controlling component, and where all these traditional categories get redefined.

His \\"Jalons\\"a series of lectures he gave at the College de France from 1980 to 1990 available only in French, still reamins the definitive place for Boulez's thoughts on creativity. But here he talks of his recent works, 'Sur Incises', 'Anthemes' in some detail,as well as his conducting experiences in Chicago, doing Mahler. Also references to early thoughts, indeterminacy,aleatoric gesturing,and John Cage. And Di Pietro is quite versed in fashionable intellectual trajectories as the pessimism of Jean Baudrillard who Boulez comments on. The only disappointment here is there wasn't more. I read this in one sitting,one single train ride,you may as well.	2001-05-27

After a long pause he said, in a voice so low it was barely a whisper,' That son of a b---he did it'. . . .  With this supreme gesture Pollock had wrapped up an era and walked away from it.&quot; Feldman was very much part of that era, the Fifties when American art was becoming the most important post-war art there was its unique expressions. Sure Europeans tried to copy us but only became more academic about as Boulez and his excursions into chance/aleatoric gesturing. This collection of essays very clearly reveals how important American expeimentalism was to music. Feldman's forever endeavor to merely create, create at a high intensity working like a Dutch diamond cutter,or lens grinder,toying with creative means as his use of indelible ink, this he said makes you think about what your writing than how you are writing, puts the creative process back into the head.Or composing at the piano, which slows you down so you need to think more. He followed the intellectual currents, anything that brought a sense of richness and other dimension to his art, he knew for instance Henri Bergson's concept of memory and time,how that might affect his music,and painterly means was second nature to him hanging out at the Cedar Bar in New York talking for hours on Light,texture,perception,shape,design,concept, facility,gesture,timbre,tone,chiarscuro, there is ample historical data here as well, almost like a subtext of these ,like an unwritten history of the avant-garde, a &quot;Conversation with Stravinsky&quot;(not really),his first meeting with John Cage(after a performance of Webern), Earle Brown, Christian Wolff, also his travels to Berlin, and England and experiencing the avant-garde through Cornelius Cardew, and British experimentalism.His last years was devoted to long durational compositions, and he merely said he had more time to compose in these years,but Feldman here is filled with marvelous quotes,things,items,shapes for the mind&quot;I knew I was going to be a professional the day I first became practical.Practicality took the form of copying out my music neatly,keeping my desk tidy and organized-all the unimportant things that seem unrelated to the work,yet somehow do affect it.&quot;.

Mr. Norris should have engaged the more directly focused political composers the sight of his analysis as editor- instigator.

Peggy Kamuf mounts the fairly limitless edifice of his work through seasoned selected excerpts,If you are fascinated forever by the conceptual,the literary,or analytic,the performative or philosphic focus,Derrida's work is like an alive moment that touches each in between elements of text,of ideas.All sometimes in simultanaeity or in context to each.If you come to Derrida it must from some place(time,geographic/cultural)some discipline,and sadly enough that acts to skew and blind,to opaque-ify Derrida's virtuoso,contextual,cross-referencing,overdetermined,overanalyzed modes of thought. But if you have scoured literature(Blanchot,Ponge,Jabes) not for its own sake,or thought,looked at ideas(Plato) (Heidegger) retrogressively yet with a committment to subversion(Genet) (Marx) of the Western canon,Derrida work serves these realms quite admirably.I humbly request you gander and pass time at this collection, peak between the blinds(Kamuf's metaphor)before you proceed directly to an original work. Derrida's work has that element of throwing forward a growth of petrified thought finding new conceptual life in the present, or not so distant past. So wherever you begin in Derrida it is like a timeless warp to be repeated some place,some time to come or had come,or had been,or will not ever be.	2001-01-12

Drew situates and places Bloch's work profoundly within the ideologic framework of this century,most of which Bloch had lived through. Bloch's writings on music are not as nearly as fascinating as his historical excursions into the realm of utopia and the various forms that manifestation has takened within the human spirit.Yes! Music admirably inhabits one of these contemplative realms and regions,music representing a place a realm to be attained,as well as a document of its time. Bloch believed all this, and it's curious a man who was present at the birth of modernity, of Expressionism in Germany,Surrealism the theatre of Leftist content of Brecht and Piscator,curious that Bloch never mentioned,nor formulated essays on the formidable acheivements of modern music. His writings stand fairly within the predictability of Germanic music, Mozart operas, Beethoven and Bruckner,a neglected creator of symphonic boulders of post-romanticism. Creators like Debussy,Ravel,Schoenberg,Bartok or Stravinsky are hardly mentioned throughout his long life. Well music was an addendum, a marginal pursuit to him. Bloch knew the primary musicians of his day the conductor Otto Klemperer always looked up wherever Bloch was living within his numerous exiles. If you've read &quot;The Principle of Hope&quot; then these essays are merely supplements to that magnum opus in three volumes.	2001-01-10

Adorno has only within the last ten years become a dare I say fashionable focus for many scholars from many perspectives and disciplines and frightfully I dare say there are unthinkable categories still remaining for scholars to pursue with this recluse apolitical Mandarin-like thinker.<br />Jay's modest book touches on the primary categories, the Negative Dialectics,dealing within the Hegelian edifice,if in fact philosophy is still thinkable, that it in fact still remains because it has yet to be realized.<br />Adorno's thinking on music was in fact very unique with a full scope of other disciplines brought into the welter of analysis. It was never done,at least not with the level of vigour Adorno had brought to the endeavor of thinking of music from a context of the social and political. This is a chasm still not closed. Adorno musically had emphasized the cultural importance with a placement on the dodecaphonic means, the 12 Tone school of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern, all of which Adorno had known during his lifetime. He had studied composition with Alban Berg.Jay metaphorically connects this to Adorno's &quot;atonal&quot; way of thinking of philosophy.<br />There is not much on &quot;Aesthetic Theory&quot;,largely it was only available in German at the time of Jay's highly readable book.	2001-01-05

He (himself when queried said) he never listens to music,recordings,but the sounds (as we all know now) that are all around us.Marvelous textures./ We simply need the committment to listen,to be committed to unitentionality,purposelessness.

Whether (that is the correct) way is beside the point, for if you are looking for discrete meanings, well you will find it in bleak,cold fragmentariness. There are passages on the very bottom of each page, the question and answer section, where you may learn particular ways of playing Cage's sometimes rather difficult music.

Stravinsky was the genius of the age, the Twenties, Carter had heard at a soiree, Persephone, with Mr. Stravinsky at the piano. He always brought an impeccable sense of rhythm, of precision, of attack.Carter distinguishes the piano composer Ravel, Igor.<br />There are great issues discussed here as the future of the orchestra, how difficult it has become to give everyone in the modern orchestra something to play. These interviews traverse only to 1971, Carter was on the threshold of his monumental Third String Quartet. But we obtain quite well thought out reflections of the darkly brooding &quot;Piano Concerto&quot;,a work completed during a stay in Berlin with students, Rzewski among them, and the &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;. The latter he had fragmented the modern orchestra into 'concertini', small ensembles of fascinating timbres.<br />Carter here is quite social in his reflections of tradition and the elitist endeavor of writing music. He reflects that we really cannot speak of a national consciousness for serious composers as Carter has so obviously become  in the past ten years. That perhaps writing music for the primary venues will be something for the past. And if we warp=speed to the present from 1971 we see the corporate agenda for orchestral commissions as Eisner's vacuous vision of &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; giving music money to Alan Jay Kernis and Michael Torke for modern creations, creations quite obvious and predictable.Yet without points of interest.<br />Carter reflects quite profoundly on his working methods, the five and seven tone chordal structures, in the &quot;Piano Concerto&quot;, and The powerfully wrought &quot;Concerto for Orchestra&quot;, the latter written during the Vietnam Times, of street anti-establishment rebellion.<br />We learn the impetus of Carter's musical aesthetic as linear, the only aesthetic worth pursuing, and he makes a profoundly convincing arguments against contra the texture bound creations a la Stockhausen, where texture became boring after the first initial moments. Or he reflects deeply on the vacuity of serial thinking that never lets the EAR be the primary focus for music, rather the highly abstracted geometric sense of music not for the EAR but the self-indulgent mind.<br />Shame this is out-of print, I have an old tattered copy that I cherish deeply.of street anti-establishment rebellion.<br />We learn the impetus of Carter's musical aesthetic as linear, the only aesthetic worth pursuing, and he makes a profoundly convincing arguments against contra the texture bound creations a la Stockhausen, where texture became boring after the first initial moments.

What is globalization? than the structure of the world surrounded with capital,shaped by it directing the poverty and foodchains of the world. I think Baudrillard forgets this, that there still is someone who creates and directs,and manipulates,and politicizes,and innoculates the populace to soften them up for consumption,controlled if possibly.<br />This collection of essays are brilliant in that Baudrillard knows how to probe beneath the surface of art,of culture, like Madonna, Michael Jackson or current Hollywood, and the politics of Europe,of the demise of communism. He does it within a formant structure,with many levels of meaning spewed out in all directions. He is a virtuoso in that respect.<br />What structures material reality? what directs it is not probed however with any degree of conviction and I think that is where his focus should be.You needn't be a Marxist to harbor these convictions simply ahumanist concerned with the direction of the world.	2000-10-09

Simpson was annotator,promoter at The BBC. He  is a composer himself of large scale symphonies.<br />Bruckner has long been  an enigmatic creator, a late bloomer,spending years in pedagogical  subjection of counterpoint.And his oefish,awkward demeanor gave a false  impression to those who surrounded him,usually less talented unclairvoyant  scholars who sought the necessity to revise his symphonies. Simpson here  scours these giant symphonic boulders one by one,revealing where a great  rupture takes place,where Bruckner's symphonic vision begins to look  outward,beginning with the Fifth Symphony. Although the D-minor Third  begins this transmogrification of vision. Bruckner looked well beyond the  shadow of Beethoven,not utilizing that aesthetic pallette of pent up  momentums,and overwrought festering movements that get resolved. Instead  the Bruckner movement in fact doesn't move,there is no forward moving  implication, we must simply withstand the overbearing presence of each  movement in its own right,within its own oceanic spaces. Simpson is a good  writer and brings some literary image to the outside gestural features, as  his machine-like repetitive conconctions, its moments which simply begin  and end mindlessly at times,as the various variegated Scherzi. You need the  score I found to read Simpson for he does drag us through these symphonies  as a callable narrative,moment to moment,step by step,(not quite note for  note) inch by inch. This can get tedious,but that is what was the usual  fare of musical analysis. Now hopefully there are those essays which  introduce more social and political dimensions to the creation of art.	2000-09-08

Mr Frederiksen has done  the best job he could,but only about 20 pages,(as the other reviewer said)  are valuable. That's if you are interested in the art of Arnold Jacobs: how  to become a virtuoso wind player,a consummate musician.<br />There seems to be  a lack a support for books like within the corrdors of established music in  the United States.I also know that music books are not great blockbluster  sale items,so they frequently get edited to hell.Well this book should have  been edited that's not the problem.The problem is focus and funding. There  should have been other writers,those who have shared Jacob's craft for  teaching,the various problems in playing a wind instrument,and more on the  theories he developed for respiratory situations and breathing,which were  quite unique to the world of brass.That's here,but not fully explicative  and quite sketchy.<br />The Chicago Symphony should have found the money to  produce a more indepth study of Jacob's art. Instead it seems Frederiksen  has much filler material here, biographies of conductors and other brass  players which reallylooses a focus and is not important for this  study.<br />Also the hardcover price keeps it out of the reach of the  multitude of student wind players throughout the country,those who could  really benefit from a study like this.(There is no paperback,nor is one  contemplated)<br />There are such similar situations in music where funding is  misplaced. The composer Ralph Shapey,as another example, also from the  Chicago area should by now have a book length analysis and discussion of  his profoundly powerful music.	2000-09-01

Knowing all these deep,dark secrets  hasn't hurt in any way the successes of Richard Wagner or Richard  Strauss,or Martin Heidegger for that matter. Since the time of the War all  have had glorious posthumous careers with entire cadres of devoted  writers,scholars,conductors and musicians surveying and performing their  work. The Wagner Ring is continuously done,so are Strauss Operas,and there  are countless books on Heidegger.<br />So what are the issues? it seems to be  idle curiosity for historical fact without explanation(as fascinating as  that seems to be), but what Kater does furnish here is actually interesting  profiles and historical data on some composers long neglected. The  marvelously powerful &quot;Symphonies&quot; of Karl Amadeus Hartmann for  one, to this day remain in a state of neglect,and the chapter here is the  only material on his life you will find in English. There is another  picture-filled book with Henze,Hartmann and Hindemith published in a  series.  In focusing on composers lives during the political times of the  Nazi era is like looking at history wrongfully from the inside out,with a  focus on an individual's life nuances without the larger perspective that  created how he/she must act. Artists and composers for the most part only  care about their careers and recognition, where is the next performance of  their?, and as Kater frequently identifies,he reveals the dirty dealing  with Nazi party hacks in order to obtain performances.<br />Much of the  material is fairly redundant as the chapter on Richard Struass or the  chapter on Kurt Weill,being Jewish we know he had no chance for successes  in an Anti-Semitic country growing more racist by the day, from 1933  forward.<br />I think there is a danger in reviewing history from this narrow  perspective of the individual,especially artists(composers) who are hardly  ever power brokers within the state of culture.Frequently the ones that are  jettisoned to the top have little artistic genius. First it erases the  sense of historical context and the inherent danger of the times. This  issue has been well discussed and documented with the  &quot;collaborationist&quot; theories during the Nazi Era,yet I doubt if it  has been answered with any degree of vigor, and we frequently overlook the  fact that the situation in war times is never a &quot;us against  them&quot;one's enemies are only revealed after the fact,there are  gradations of affiliation between individuals when speaking of  betrayel,corruption and greed.<br />It still remains an open question for us  who sit here in a retrospective position, that given a situation of  politically dangerous times,not necessarily times of War,which is obvious,  but would we have collaborated with a Nazi party hack,when our survival,or  demise was a phone call away? That will always be a question we can never  answer,but Kater's book certainly makes this question all the more a  reality,especially when the focus is on another's creative life.re is a danger in reviewing history from this narrow  perspective of the individual,especially artists(composers) who are hardly  ever power brokers within the state of culture.Frequently the ones that are  jettisoned to the top have little artistic genius.

It's fascinating how philosophy(we learn)  needed a stimulant,perhaps a sign, a signature of post-modernity,and  art,Pop Art was far more interesting to discuss than literature,speaking of  the work of Danto.<br />This arduous Atlantic Wall where Europeans don't  understand us, and we don't understand them is time now to be broke or it  is breaking in some places now that the structuralist  storms(early,middle,and post) has subsided.<br />Someone with the scope of  thought of Jurgen Habermas has done much toward breaking down this  artificial and self-serving wall,where his thought has embraced Pierce,and  this corridor of the social,the pragmatic and the analytic.	2000-08-07

Stefano plays all the arduously difficult new music literature for the contrabass. He travels with a violoncello,so he can play all that  repertoire as well. When he plays this music he often ponders Calvino, five  primary conceptual corridors toward what he thought of as literature,but  music as well can be contemplated with these ideas. &quot;Lightness&quot;,  well music has a density, Mozart played games with it, and interpreting  Mozart can be a treatise in the dialectic,the transformations and timbral  modulations of lightness to heaviness.,ask any violinist.Calvino of course  expounds on Kundera's popular book, on the weight of the lifeworld of  living in the East,the coal-dusted passageways,or of a fallen love,begun  transgressivly there as well. Dante is a frequent pilgrim(example) here the  lightness of snow falling imperceptibly on the mountainside.  &quot;Quickness&quot;, but not how fast things move,(our Silicon Valley)  odious airjets that may puncture the ozone layer,or violins, but the  quickness of an image to transform our consciousness,to lighten it up from  the cruel oppression of citylife.That's poetry.

The age after  post-modern, now is for the eye, for the concept,and the cloistered world  of opera was indeed ripe for picking to nourish it with this interest in  production.Not that singers and conductors have receded into disuse,but  this priority for concept is far more interesting than a Diva's vacation  spot. Sutcliff's first premise is that you should do something to opera to  make it exciting and those who simply sit back contented with old  stuffy,dust-ladened productions only do the future of opera a disservice.  Sutcliffe has seen it all, and he summons this knowledge to speak on  profound directions we have perhaps only heard about. He has a great skill  for analysis touching the aesthetic, how the stage looks, the overall  philosophic content,the inherent meaning all become clear. Heavy hitters  here are Patrice Chereau,who had almost no operatic experience when he was  summoned to direct the One-Hundreth Ring of Wagner,with Pierre Boulez. In  short a scandale resulted,but here Sutcliffe vaults over the obvious and  identifies Chereau's working language and concept of a somewhat  Marxist(George Bernard Shaw) interpretation, although Chereau himself  hasn't little proclivities in those political areas.He identifies how for  instance a stage lit in somber colours can convey the sense of the  timeless. Peter Sellers as well and the Americanization of opera , a  director that fits within Sutcliffe's criteria of making interest on Operas  stage is here.Handel's Giulio Cesare, set updated to a resort with lawn  chairs,puffy Presidential speeches, and a Cleopatra with terri-cloth robe,  sunglasses and cheap dangly beads all serve as a means of deconstructing  the present or past. Still the element of humanism emanated from Sellers  sensitive characterizations, the various solo arias Sesto,and Cornelia on  death,on future,on vengeance and national wishes. Pioneers as Peter Brook  are also here his Salome where Salvador Dali constructed the constumes and  sets were sabotaged we learn. Brook started at an early age,yet here he was  a good experimentor, alone voice with opera going against the tide of  British narrow-minded criticism. Ruth Berghaus's political Wagner Ring is  also discussed within categories of Feminism. But I fail to see the  committment to ideology there,only another piece of ornament to infuse the  opera.Still Sutcliffe introduces all these categories to ponder. David  Alden, Graham Vick, Richard Jones all are  given analytic space with a  focus on Welsh Productions, The English National Opera and Covent  Garden.Directors haven't the time to write their concepts down. Jonathan  Miller being the most prolific, and Peter Brook. But the result is usually  short cursive essays.

Part of this was labeled &quot;the new  virtuosity&quot;.And pieces owe their creation to the overwhelming  performative skills,persistence and imagination of these soloists.There was  not much precedent emamating from the vigours of modernity, in fact there  was no unaccompanied work for the trombone or tuba, or french horn until  well into the Twentieth century.These virtuosi are too numerous to mention,  but certainly William O.Smith was the first to explore multiphonics on the  Bb Clarinet in the early Sixties, Bertram Turetsky also found the hidden  timbres in the contrabass, almost like a sonic archeologist picking and  scraping through the historical baggage of their instruments. Vinko  Globokar(avant-garde, and Albert Magelsdorff(free jazz) in Europe both on  trombone as well, but their counterpart here in the States was Stuart  Dempster, an incredible virtuoso. Composers wrote for him as no other,once  they heard him play.He had a real innate gift for the avant-garde, I recall  him crawling around the floor of the stage striking matches to create  extended sounds in John Cage's &quot;Solo for Sliding  Trombone&quot;,disassembling the trombone blowing into all the remaining  tubes to great mysterious affect. He had premiered dozens of works  throughout the Sixties and Seventies by distinguished American  composers,  Ben Johnnston, Robert Erikson, Jacob Druckman, John Cage, and Luciano Berio  his Sequenza #5 which was the high water mark, a piece that today is a  standard staple in the literature. Dempster solidifies all this experience  in this book actually the first, the premiere work to  discuss,multiphonics(singing and playing simulataneously),muting, and  extended techniques for the trombone. This instrument has come light years  transcending its cumbersome constitution as inhabiting the backwalls of the  orchestral placement to enter for a choral like chord. No, now however  through the eyes and ears of Dempster's imagination it has become now a  complete universe of sound. Chapters here include very practical examples  of all these techniques citing the master works of the literature. Although  out-of-print I wish the publishers would attempt to update these incredibly  valuable works, Phillip Rehnfelt has one on the Clarinet, Bertram Turetsky  on the Contrabass, and one on the Flute, a compendium on multiphonics.  Dempster now has extended his creativity into the fascinating world of the  aborginal tribal instrument (the down under world) of the didjeridu, a long  hollowed-out wood tube done by termites in its original form.

He has been writing on his music, all of it where his  creativity has touched all genres including a sizable repertoire in film,  since 1960s. This work here is haiku-like excerpts, But for Takemitsu  that's all we really need for he ascends right to the center of where  creativity occurs squarely on point. If thinking on music knows some  geometric graphic, the shortest distance between two points it is here. He  is a deep thinker, when his November Steps for Orcehstra was performed by  The New York Philharmonic,he wandered the streets around his hotel in  Manhatten trying to get the experience inside him, to wind it down in a  way.Silence is what nature has given us, we then as creators fill it, or  structure sounds around silence. He keeps his own culture rich in  complexity always in the forefront of his thinking. He compares for  instance the simultaneous complexity of the Japanese instruments, the  shakuhachi flute and the biwa,like a lute, and the overwhelming experience  when he first heard a Western size orchestra in The United States.He has  written for both in an interesting way, trying to forge an East-West  amalgam,knowing the conceptual limitations of both genres.Takemitsu's music  comes from nature, he has essays here on water,trees,silence and gardens,  and he equates the durational part of his orchestral work as like a quiet  private walk in a garden.If you ever heard his music it is rich in textural  display,colourful knowing full the uniqueness of timbre from any  instrument. Frequently his orchestral work features an instrument to  function almost like a concerto. Dreams are also important to him as his  work&quot; A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden&quot; where his  orchestral thinking lends itself quite well toward a timeless canvas of  sound,sputtering and slowly transforming from colour to colour in the  orchestra. You rarely feel the barline pulse in his music. On his film  work,he was the first to purely utilize simple percussive sounds as  wind-chimes,maraca and bamboo chimes as accompaniment to film, which is now  the lingua franca of the film composers repertoire.There is nothing like  the placement of a sharp maraca pulse with silences to create a sense of  tension and danger. He won an award for his score to Kurosawa's  &quot;Ran&quot; a deeply violent film with literally hundreds of extras  fighting battles of early aristocratic agrarian struggles. There are also  sensitive portraits of other artists as John Cage,who had helped Takemitsu  find a place in the West. There was still animosity against the Japanese  that went well into the Sixties from the Second World War in artistic  circles as well. So we hardly knew of this rich repertoire of orchestral  work out of Japan. His reflections extended to a music festival in Honolulu  where the visual artist Jasper Johns was in attendance and recalls his  briefcase had only a deck of cards, a carton of cigarettes, a mystery novel  and a sketchpad. The sketchpad was used for a work the Johns completed  while there renting a studio.The &quot;Watchmen&quot; was the painting left  behind.colour to colour in the  orchestra.

There he  described the confluence of Cardew's use of the Analects of Confucius with  expression for the common man/woman,Cardew's intent utilized graphics as a  common language read by anyone, a music for amateurs and professional  instrumentalists to sing and play simultaneously.Nyman's rather modest  pamphlet here when written, it was the only comprehensive explanation of  what for the most part remained a confused, variegated,and fragemented  avant-garde.One with no discernable direction,nor creative agenda accept  possibly not to have one,in the typical Zen fashion of the times. The  departures here and most of what Nyman discusses emanate from the Post-Cage  realm of non-expression. The concern was in process,in graphic notation, in  the means rather than the ends, how a process can undergo multiplication  either through determinate means, actual writing of music or improvisation,  or a mixtures of both.Cage began much of these departures along with  associates Morton Feldman and Earle Brown, and later Christian Wolff.Here  Cage with his various Variations, was the biginning marks where the  performers needed to prepare a score to perform from a set of guidelines  determining tones,rhythm,duration,physical placement and selection of  instrument.The score was a set of instructions, a blueprint in a way.There  was no right or wrong way merely one that didn't excite and inspire. This  reduction of the creative process to its bare minimum was an exciting step  hence there was plenty of room for divine intervention. Schoenberg, Cage's  teacher had taught him the wealth of processes in music from the reservoir  of variation form. And his use of it throughout his life, is akin to an  unoffical hommage to the master of dodecaphonic thinking.Cage went on to  compose seven such works each entitled Variations with a successive number.  It was like a diary.  Nyman is a perceptive writer discussing the  minimalist expressions as well,a realm which came to work for him.Back when  he wrote this work minimalism was just beginning to be recognized as a  viable road a subversion of the Western Canon, and what was labeled as the  tyrannical serial road as practiced by the Europeans. Reading Nyman today  in retrospect is far more interesting however than appraising the  repetitive patterns cadre today, for back in the late Sixties, early  Seventies, these minimalists concepts, of transforming, scaling,nuanced  timbral changes and permutating rhythm as mosaic patterns indeed opened up  a creative chasm that has only been closed now. The market success of it is  all a matter of history now.Even the Post-minimalists a la John Adams have  exhausted its bleak emotive world. But Nyman was the first to discuss  Reich's music, and that of Phillip Glass, and there early music was indeed  much more exciting than their current homogenized,mannered and overlabored  music today.Nyman was actually the shrewdest of the lot regenerating this  creativity into the service (uncompromised) market. Improvisation also  represented a new turn of the page, and a profound way of eradicating the  package, the creator. The remarkable improvisors AMM, Keith Rowe and Eddie  Prevost(later Cornelius Cardew,and John Tilbury) also make a great  contribution here to Nyman's work. AMM was the first to adopt a post-Cage  perspective,yet infusing their sensitive performances with more an ethic, a  concern for the human condition which was a rather opaque and of mariginal  value in the Cage edifice of creativity.Rowe utilized the radio as a sound  source for instnace, but had projected a deep musicianship in its mixing it  with his signature sound of the bowed electric guitar .A genre today where  countless copy cats exhibit their expressions. Nyman also touches on the  newuse of melodic means, a realm that was to blossum wholeheartedly along  all the creative avenues of the avant-garde throughout the Seventies coming  ferociously up to the present times, with the homogenization of the  commissioning agenda in today's orchestral venues.Melody represented a  common experience a common language, and similar to jazz it was the focus  of a piece.The work ends with Cardew's apostasy into Marxism and his  utilization of revolutionary songs in arrangement form.Nyman short-changes  this in some way, not realizing its implication, as no one else.use of melodic means, a realm that was to blossum wholeheartedly along  all the creative avenues of the avant-garde throughout the Seventies coming  ferociously up to the present times, with the homogenization of the  commissioning agenda in today's orchestral venues.Melody represented a  common experience a common language, and similar to jazz it was the focus  of a piece.The work ends with Cardew's apostasy into Marxism and his  utilization of revolutionary songs in arrangement form.Nyman short-changes  this in some way, not realizing its implication, as no one else.	2000-05-08

He allows everyone to feel at home, at ease,like catching more flies with sugar quip.  Like asking John Cage for instance, &quot;I don't have a very good  understanding of what your early musical training was like,&quot;. or to La  Monte Young, asking if he is the &quot;father of minimalism&quot;, I guess  it doesn't matter now, since most of what is discussed has played itself  out. Here Duckworth interviews creators of primary creative genres of  Americana leaning toward the achievements of all the various,nefarious  &quot;isms&quot;, experimentalism, minimalism, well just intonation doesn't  fit, and the ubiquitously opaque post-modernity. And progressing from who  are considered the Mammas and Pappas to the younger generation.The genre of  Interviews seem to be occurring with greater frequency,speaking of one of  the features of post-modernity. It is the most immediate way of knowing  someone's art, aesthetic, how they feel about the world,about politics, or  how they don't feel. Obsessions are explored in these interviews,as with  John Zorn's early buying jags of recordings,jazz etc.,and formative years  as with La Monte Young and his obsessions with sound, listening to  telephone generators,or machines, the inherent drone in these industrial  objects,Also professional associations, and disassociations with the New  York scene,Fluxus which includes,just about everyone here interviewed is  probed, with nice discussions of the early years of performance art in New  York City.  Education away from academia was an important component of  American music,sorry to say, with those of the post war-generation turning  to the east, and World Music, as Steve Reich, Phil Glass,Lou Harrison,  Pauline Oliveros and La Monte Young. Young in particular reflects on his  education with Pandit Pran Nath on intonation and improvisation and  learning it with Marian Zazeela.Professional associations, how to survive  by being a performance artist, Duckworth pursues and explores with Meridith  Monk and Laurie Anderson, finding gigs in New York City or Europe again was  everyone's passion.How do you work? is also a wonderful question, Monk  reflects that she has to work all the time to feel attached, whereas she  knows composers who don't work for months and claim to feel they don't lose  anything. How creators get into ,what they get into, as Ben Johnston  reflects on his early education with instrument iconoclast Harry Partch,  how Partch taught Johnston to sing fractional tones, an eleventh/sixteenth,  and how Partch would devote mornings to music, and afternoons to physical  work, building sheds,or home extensions,or gathering wood. Also Johnston  speaks about his wonderful string quartets, the Seventh in particular which  is based on an 100-tone scale, and how we come to understand it via the  relationships it represents rather than hearing 100 isolated tones. With  Lou Harrison we have almost a history of American music, in that his life  traversed through the primary achievements, the interests in World Music,  Tunings, percussion music, and extended techniques,living on both coasts.  But Harrison claims he was always a melodic composer, he had to sing  whatever he wrote first, to attach himself to the world of sound, no matter  how complex his music became.Some interviews are boring however as the the  one with Phillip Glass where he simply recounts his life, and his  interests, there was not a spirit of adventure, of discovery.Whereas Milton  Babbitt has wonderful reflections on his early studies in music with Roger  Sessions, and how Babbitt felt he needed to start over.

But the music world has  market designs, which doesn't help creators as recluse as Sorabji.There are  focused and detailed essays here fascinating to read,almost like a time  warp erased Sorabji's name from existence,only to be found now. If you are  totally unfamiliar with his music, or have only heard isolated recordings,  this collection will admirable fill in the blank and opaque spaces.  Here  you have writers who actually knew Sorabji during his lifetime, who  corresponded with him, and were given reserved permission to play his work  after an audition performance. If you are a pianist certainly the highlight  here is Geoffrey Douglas Madge's interview with Paul Rapoport on the  performing difficulties and experiences of the live performance of Opus  clavicembalisticum. Wonderful how Madge discusses the timbre of different  pianos he had to contend with on the threshold of a performance, as well as  the sheer physical difficulty. But our minds are fixed where if something  is done enough, this work in particular renders itself smaller in dimension  the more one spends their time on its colossus length. Michael Habermann,  who is a fine Sorabji pianist also gives a nice overview of the generative  sources of the piano music, bringing his performing experiences. He  discusses what represents the Sorabji sound, the source of his creations  like Listz,Alkan,Busoni,Godowsky, Medtner,Rachmaninoff, Szymanowski,  Reger,Delius,Mahler and Ravel.Sorabji we learn detested the classical frame  as an end in and of itself, where music is almost rendered preconceived  beforehand, like a cook with a recipe. Instead he wanted his music to  challenge him, to allow an emotive synergism to occur almost similar to a  spontaneous combustion,where the various timbres and textures of the piano  would find their own emotive life.Halbermann traces the influence of these  composers into the Sorabji piano language. Kenneth Derus,is a fine scholar  who knew Sorabji and offers a thought piece entitled Perigraph, which is an  excursion into the comprehensibility the perception of repitition, shape  combinations,what constitutes change in Sorabji's music. This was a lecture  which I suspect has been transformed in structure. Derus has experience in  the philosophic realm which informs his piece here. More Sorabji I hope,  should be thought from this perspective,giving word combination  associations as point of thought. Alistar Hinton, the current Archivalist  of Sorabji(and a composer) also adds wonderful reminicences of his  association with Sorabji which dated back to 1969. And the editor here Paul  Rapoport also includes an interview which touches the important areas,  Sorabji's ethnicity,also the seldom discussed symphonic poems. What also  emits itself here is Sorabji's demeanor. Most thought he was irreproacable,  a stubborn opinionated man,and he was, until he heard pianists play his  work at his home giving them the seal of approval for performance. There  are exhaustive lists of all Sorabji's works,with performance diaries of the  piano works by the growing cadre of pianists. Also letters are reproduced  to the writers here to and from Sorabji as well as music examples.Sorabji  worked as a music critic, and he was a fascinating writer much like his  music with a high dense vocabulary of words and images.bustion,where the various timbres and textures of the piano  would find their own emotive life.Halbermann traces the influence of these  composers into the Sorabji piano language.

Yet Boulez's aesthetic has not  undergone a metamorphosis that is unrelated not totally unrecognizable from  his youth.And all these essays are reflections and position papers,  analyses,technical points like Sprechgesang and encyclopedic like entries.  All were a means toward a comprehension of the situation in music at the  end of the Second World War.The analytical essay &quot;Stravinsky  remains&quot; is perhaps the most valuable item here . This is a dissection  of his Rite of Spring, how the rhythm works like cells being placed  together into mosaic-like patterns,creating textures,but truncating the  rhythmic identities. &quot;To the farthest reach of the fertile  country&quot; is an essay here inspired by a quote from Paul Klee, who has  remained an enduring inspiration to Boulez to this day. This essay is on  the implications of electronic composition, which in the early Fifties  represented a new universe of sound and its conception. It was also  dangerous, for how will it enter the realm of culture and creativity, how  will electronics interface with the expressive concerns of form and  content, and sonic manipulation. Recall that Boulez in his youth was a  fiery activist for the cause of serial composition. Anyone who didn't follw  this cause was useless and unimportant.He, for instance called for all  opera houses to be burned to the ground, and loathed the likes of Verdi or  Puccini exclaiming the vulgarity of their music. He also led jeering  sections at concerts. But all this soon, to use his words, stopped,Boulez  stopped barking like a dog outside. The infamous and misunderstood article  &quot;Schoenberg is Dead&quot; is included here. Boulez never meant this  title in a derogatory way, simply a ubiquitous use of the French phrase,  the &quot;king is dead&quot;, referring to the French Revolution. All  Boulez meant was indeed modest, that Schoenberg's conception of the  dodecaphonic language simply didn't extend itself into all the parameters  of music.This is true of form in particular, where Schoenberg had  retrogressed utilizing Baroque forms situated within atonal means. All of  the grande auteurs that Boulez later conducted for the next thirty years  are discussed in essay form: Alban Berg, Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy,  Stravinsky and Schoenberg. There is also an essay on &quot;Alea&quot;, the  indeterminate aleatoric idea which fascinated Boulez  at this time the  Fifties, and triggered his lifelong interest in Mallarme. His Third Piano  Sonata was the focus of this concept of introducing performative freedoms  into a work, much like encountering the mobiles of Alexander Calder, where  fixed shapes rotates and interrelate in forever newer configurations.Here  Boulez gives indications why he intends to embark on this creative  excursion citing points in history without introducing much technical  detail.The original of the work entitled &quot;Notes of an  Apprenticeship&quot; was published by Alfred A Knopf in 1968  and has been  unavailable.to use his words, stopped,Boulez  stopped barking like a dog outside.

Boulez was the first to realize the creative implications of the dodecaphonic language begun by Arnold Schoenberg later Anton Webern.  Serialism was a vigorous extension of the utilization of the profound  number of 12, all of the tones in the tempered system. This 12 was extended  to rhythm,duration, articulation and dynamics, so not only pitch was a  point of organization.What this created was a situation where sound could  now be projected in an infinite variety of shapes and designs. Serialism  was a brief epoch like any epoch with a beginning middle and end, and it  came to a marvelous end around the late Fifties. Its demise can be  explained by the exhaustion of the language, of its music materials. Each  work was an excursion into eradicating itself. Boulez, of his gneration was  always the most musical, always with tangible gestures and emotive threads  traceable to Debussy,or Webern or Messiaen, wheras composers like  Stockhausen, or Nono, Berio,tried to erase this connection. Boulez brought  an informed musical sensibility, an aesthetic of the sensuous, the exotic,  and mysterious to his music,informed by World Music as well, as the  instrumental constitution that Marteau suggests. Serialism had its problems  however, structurally, it couldn't extend itself into larger  forms,orchestration was also problematical, and there was a point where the  complexity the density of the phrase existed purely for itself, for no one  could hear it. Marteau however is a classic precisily because it harbored  modest expressive goals, albeit within an incredibly complex structural  plan.Koblyakov discusses Boulez's use of harmony, a concept others of his  generation might well dismiss. And the fascination here is the analysis of  points,and simultanaeities of density, how they function within locally  from note to note and from movement to movement, how harmonies are  constructed, their gradations and shape.Marteau unfolds as the three poems  Boulez selected in three discreet sections composed of shorter movements,  with what is now a classic avant-garde instrumental combination of voice,  viola, alto flute, guitar and a large array of handheld  percussion&amp;(vibraphone).As a tribute to this works profundity, there  were countless works by Boulez contemporaries with this identical set  after.  Boulez's aesthetic always sought the means toward multiplication,  how a germ of an idea can sustain, refigure and reproduce itself. This is  done here with reiteration of the materials of the serialized 12, with  harmonies accreting and diminishing as the work progresses.How pitch  reproductions can exist on alocal level within each movement and on a  global level, within the entire work.  Koblyakov impeccably traces these  complex transformations of pitch with wonderful graphic tables equally  exhaustive as the work.

Koechlin was a contemporary of Debussy, and Satie, yet we seldom have heard his music. Even today there is scant  recordings, and what there was in the past was inferior to our modern ears  now. I recall an excellent early disc however with the BBC Orchestra under  Antal Dorati with Koechlin's Bander-Log, with Messiaen and Boulez works  included.Today however there are exceptions with conductor Simon Rattle,  and David Zinman here.  The Koechlin aesthetic followed a lifelong  fascination with a full spectrum of conceptual complexities in nature, but  also classical mythology, Roman civilization, the jungle, the night,  starlit sky, dreams and fantasy, yearnings for distant shores, also the sea  and water. Water in particular inspired the wonderful set of piano solos  &quot;Paysages et marines (1915-16) subtitled Landscapes and  Seascapes.There you will find the piano evoking a fluidity largly by  sustained sounds in the lower regions of the piano,shaped yet waiting for  its full decay.Creativily Koechlin was a miniaturist finding genres(as the  piano solo)as deep recepticles for these countless images,where one work  could scour through some 40 images. The Chants de Nectaires is an example  and has an unusual premise as well, it is a work for unaccompanied flute of  some three hours,with an array of dances,prayers, and songs. The virtuoso  Pierre-Yves Artaud has edited a performing version, after years of  neglect.Koechlin's other side is the Sonatinas for piano which are  childlike in their harmonic simplicity,yet not facile in their conception.  Orledge identifies all of the genres in Koechlin's creative edifice with a  deep focus on the elements of music at work here. Rhythm was not as  important as harmony for instnace,yet in  melody reigns supreme.He abhorred  rhythmic excursion for the mere sake of it. If anything at all Koechlin's  creativity utilized his innate gift for lyricism.And being lyrical implies  a reduced focus on harmonic progression of rhythmic complexity. Orledge  admirable covers each in succession. His life is treated in periods rather  than genres, in that he wrote in each,however incomplete and at times  immature that creative process proved to be.Also there is a look at his  uniqueness as an orchestrator.There are wonderful vintage photographs as  well as numerous musical examples, many being reductions and transpositions  from the original source.he mere sake of it.

Most of his durationally short sculpted-like music reflects this. The overwhelmingly powerful symphonic poems, The Sun Treader or Men  and Mountains. There you will find large robust,full-bodied brass and  lyrical lines,in octaves and unisons to enhance their sheer power. Yet  Ruggles has miniatures, his Portals a mere 63 odd measures for strings  alone, or his mysterious Angels for muted trumpets and trombones is even  shorter than that. He has only one single work for the piano, Evocations,  which he revised his entire life. Marilyn Ziffrin was quite brave searching  for Ruggles alone in retirement, barely able to hear at his home,she found  him eating,crumbs falling on his sweater in the clapboard Cut Leaf Maples  Motel in Arlington Vermont. He wouldn't allow her a tape recorder so she  took copious notes. But it wasn't until a full year later returning from  work at The University of Chicago that her story begins of one of our most  fascinating American pioneers. Ziffrin tells a good story following the  Ruggles throughout there lives in various places, New York, Winona,  Minneapolis, Florida,and Arlington. She captures the details of the  everyday, Carl chomping on his cigar while searching for dissonant tones  and resonance on his rented piano. Harmonies we learn were incidental,  Ruggles was a contrapuntal composer who wrote in his own invented atonal  language. He had distinguished friends as well, Robert Frost, Charles Ives,  Leopold Stokowski, and the pianist John Kirkpatrick who became the executor  of his Estate.In reading this comprehensive work, we learn of American  history as well, and how one coped with the Depression years. Ruggles was a  consummate painter with over 300 paintings which are part of museaum  collections in Detroit, but primarily privatly owned. The two disciplines  fused together for Ruggles, he said he &quot;painted&quot; music, as well  as supporting himself with its sale.himself with its sale.	2000-05-02

Lebrecht is a comprehensive funny critic who loves gossip,mirth and merriment, drudging and retreading,coming to terms with wealth,power money  and talent in the cloistered arena of classical pursuits. If you ever  wanted to know who has failed, or when a composer has spent himself  irreparably or sexual preference, this book is the place for it. Poor New  Yorker Lukas Foss is referred to as a &quot;poor man's Bernstein&quot;, and  Berio the livilier part of the avant-garde. For those composers who fall  unneatly into the cracks and crevices of unknown musical history as Howard  Skempton, regardless of age or creative metamorphosis he is associated with  the Cardew bunch,being ganglike a disciple or follower. Lebrecht never  acknowledges that composers are human just like critics and theymay make  mistakes like everyone else.The brighter side to this miniature  encyclopedia is that it is unquestionably a necessary one, for the new, the  contemporary in music, be avant-garde or the bland conservatism that passes  for music in Lebrect's town of London, has been scattered to the winds.  There is scant focused information on contemporary composers, and those of  neglect(and the list has oceanic dimensions)like,Lloyd,Hartmann, Sorabji,or  Hauer,La Monte Young,Haba, Harrison,Ezra Simms,Ben  Johnston,Sciarrino,Gentile, and Tenney,Lebrecht at least mentions a  blurb,so you know someone exists. The formidable musical pillars of this  century have adequete space, those of Mahler,Janacek, Stravinsky, even  Busoni,Bernstein, Stockhausen and Berio encompass girth-like  proportions.Lebrecht if you read carefully always fashions a point by what  is popular,successful(market-wise) and what sells, and you really get both  sides, damn if you do and you don't syndrome. This is a laudable position  to be in,the critics, to write on wealth and success and neglect,failure  and poverty, there will always be an abundance of all of it under  globalization. The point is to predict I think,to give a value judgement  with some semblance of sustenance and longevity, and critics run from that  like poison ivy at a picnic.give a value judgement  with some semblance of sustenance and longevity, and critics run from that  like poison ivy at a picnic.	2000-04-28

John Cage was the first to introduce Pierre Boulez to the United States. In New York he took Boulez around visiting painters and musicians, this was the early Fifties. David Tudor(long a Cage friend) was performing Boulez's  Second Piano Sonata for the first time. Bookstores were frequent stops and  Boulez( we learn) never heard of the poet e.e.cummings, and bought a modest  book of his poetry. Some thirty years later Boulez set a text of cummings  for 22 unaccompanied voices. This correspondence was between two innovators  coming from radically different places yet stopping at the same conceptual  places. And it is a shame that this friendship fell out quickly,each going  into radically different venues. Boulez although fascinated with chance  procedures(which Cage had been working with the I Ching, Book of Changes at  that time) Boulez was arrongantly fascinated by the aesthetic object,its  history and attenuation, and has remained so since. This correspondence has  frequent entries on the concept of indeterminacy, again Boulez comes to it  via Mallarme, and aleatoric thinking, the throwing of the dice.Boulez  sought a musical structure that contained the element of chance as in his  Third Piano Sonata in the latter Fifties. Both however were at a creative  place in modernity when the Western canon of structure and  comprehensibility was falling itself.However it is odd for Boulez to this  day thinks of his work as moments containing a &quot;freedom&quot; of  something, when he conducts Mahler, he thinks of those passages that are  freer than others,like a symphony is a dialogue between the two. Mahler's  Sixth Symphony is the case in point. There are letters of Boulez to Cage,  while in South America with the Barrault Theatre Company, one entry  includes a description from Boulez that he is having a good time  &quot;milhauding&quot; around, referring to Darius Milhaud the composer who  frequently utilized folk elelments in his music by collecting them in  volumes.Nattiez is a very sympathetic observer to this cause of modernity  and the roots of things..Nattiez is a very sympathetic observer to this cause of modernity  and the roots of things.	2000-04-28

He was not one to give-up personal details on his life, he said so to a reviewer arrongantly when he was newly appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic. Peyser had  access to rehearsals,dinners,lunches and insider trades and gossip, and all  that is here, but also we find Boulez at work, the conductor and composer,  a rehearsal schedule in included here ;when he looked for an apartment or  an eye doctor appointment. Peyser is not a creative person so the sorry  side of the book is that it remains as an outsider looking in, for Boulez's  creative secrets are not revealed simply from hanging around him as she  did. No you need to have studied the Boulez aesthetic, where it comes from,  from the roots of modernity, Mallarme, Paul Klee, Schoenberg and recently  Francis Bacon.Those books do exist and excellent one by Dominic Jameux, and  there are a few on specific aspects of the Boulez aesthetic, (harmony Lev  Koblyakov, one on Mallarme,another on conducting,Jean Vermeil) I still  enjoy re-reading this work, Peyser knows how to tell a good story, how to  pick at details of the everyday, the excitement of creating and conversing.	2000-04-28

It's fascinating that he divides the book into two halves, claiming the Spanish Civil War,(1936 to 1939) as a moment which  divided Spain. I would have gone farther into the Fifties,for Franco had  kept a repression of the arts well past the official end of the Civil War.  Spain had its grandfathers Manuel de Falla,Albeniz, and Granados,all here  amply discussed as to their influence on future generations. The  conservative side seemed to dominate Spanish music up to the Fifties,  interests in a national voice with past nostalgia, composers of the  Zarzuelas,and the Generation of 1927 are focal points. But composers here  were quick to absorb the innovations of European modernity of Bartok and  Stravinsky.  The Generation of 1951 Marco refers is the post World War 2  generation, composers like Luis de Pablo who we see(almost exclusivily) on  Europes most rigorous festivals. Spain has had a cultural distance an  isolation from the power centers of Europe, and like embarking into the  regions to acquire knowledge and wealth like colonialists, is a fascinating  perspective here.It seems how the only Spanish composers who gained  recognition in the capitals in Europe are those composers who fostered  close ties with composer power brokers, like Italian composer Franco  Donatoni,Pierre Boulez, or Stockhausen. The second half here of this book,  is all about splinter groups it seems again a convenient way to describe  different expressive interests, So we have The Associates,The  Moderates,composers like Abril,who search for a meeting place of the  conservative voice and innovation, The Independents.Spain still remains  isolated in that we seldom have a chance to hear this music only read about  it.	2000-04-17

The scope of Cage is seemingly immense, the implications of his work has touched varigated corners and crevices,abandoned places: the music world,  the world of poetry,conceptual art, performance art, mushroom  enthusiasts,opera, and other synergistic art forms we have no label for  yet. Perloff herself chooses the influence of Duchamp to discuss, the ends  of things of the Western canon was a frightening yet fascinating point in  the last century. And Cage always had done everything,like Duchamp with an  element of the lighthearted at work. There are analysis here as well as  seasoned music essayist Jann Pasler's discussion on Cage's  &quot;Composition in Retrospect&quot; a 1981 mesostic text. Pasler helps  explain what this figuritivly complex yet disarmingly word play composition  means. Cage wrote many of his most important works in this structural form.  And his own &quot;Overpopulation and Art&quot; is included here, asa a  guiding means of response to these participants. This is as close as Cage  gets to social and political/environmental reflection, you will not  recognize Cage here.  Herbert Lindenberger is a well known writer in the  cloistered world of Opera and he admirably reflects on Cage's one and only  Opera &quot;Europeras&quot; and the Aesthics that may emit itself from that  varigated and multidimensional work. Although aesthtics in its  traditionally bound demeanor was always and remained a by-product of the  Cage edifice, here in this opera he lets other impart their aesthtic  desires by allowing singers to choose their own arias to perform. Also Cage  scholar Joan Retallack(who has also an impressive series of interviews with  Cage) speaks here on &quot;Poetics of a Complex Realism&quot;, and this  refers to the American dimension of Cage, a topic seldom discussed. This  refers to the Trancendentalists tradition of social rebellion although  quite passive in retrospect. Writers like Thoreau were important to Cage.  Cage activism points in mysterious and undramatic ways. The making of  meaning through performance and collaboration was what Cage had valued and  he contributed that legacy to the last century. Artifacts of art need  continuous nurturing,scholarly explication, regular performance and tried  and tested aesthetic canons to be attenuated. Rather within this insecure  world, Cage's hope was to nurture a tradition of performers,of  communicators equipped with a conceptual fredom of expressive means through  a varied and interdisciplinary world which didn't seem to depend on any one  particular discipline or technique, as the rigours of composition or,  playing the violin, or writing symmetrical verse.ters like Thoreau were important to Cage.

Rather within this insecure  world, Cage's hope was to nurture a tradition of performers,of  communicators equipped with a conceptual fredom of expressive means through  a varied and interdisciplinary world which didn't seem to depend on any one  particular discipline or technique, as the rigours of composition or,  playing the violin, or writing symmetrical verse.	2000-04-12

Boulez always found inroads into the theory of his works, like the indeterminate,  aleatoric Third Piano Sonata which includes an analysis here, great reading  from tis documentary value. Also reflections on Debussy's Jeux, a seminal  work for the post-war generation of composers, the epiphanic, the slow  introduction of materials and their appraisal. The problem is that Boulez  writes quite tersivily, in short bursts, much like the sonic poet he is.  Also the work on Wagner's Ring is discussed quite well, the approach to  faster tempi, and Wagner's free form almost leitmotiv, where these musical  ideas float through. There is also much on administration, on creating  IRCAM, and reflections on where Booulez came from, profiles of  Desormiere,Hans Rosbaud, Hermann Scherchen. Boulez would frequent their  rehearsals, a hands-on non credit education.	2000-04-07

Many have labeled Carter an elite creator,but that's a  matter of reference(well Carter did walk out on a performance in Chicago  due to Leonard Slatkin's pre-concert remarks). Schiff remarkably covers all  the great Carter works, the turbulent works of the Sixties and Seventies,  the darkly brooding Piano Concerto(written in West Berlin) and the Concerto  for Orchestra,a Sixties work of violence, a reflection on the Anti-War  Times. The latter unaccompanied solos are all here as well, all works  written,for the most part after the First Edition. Schiff frequently  reflects upon what works in a piece, a purely function premise that  explains much, and is food for thought to any youngster hoping to someday  write just like Elliot Carter. I miss the photographs from the First  Edition, those with Stravinsky and Boulez, and the Carter manuscript  reproductions included there. Schiff seems quite lucid in speaking about  all this complexity whether rhythmic,structural or pitchbound. I didn't  know for instance that Carter has kept a harmony book, sort of a creative  Oracle to refer to over ones life. The chapters divide things again quite  clearly, The Chamber Music, The Vocal Music, The Piano Music and  Orchestral, with a nice Appendix of Carter's Listing of Three to Six Note  Chords, also a Chronological Catalogue of Works, a select Bibliography and  Discography, a List of Charts. A shame however is, although the winner of  numerous Pulitzers, Carter until quite recent times has been neglected here  in this country fighting in his home territory, the Eastern Musical  Establishment and the Bernstein Clique of the Sixties and Seventies. Boulez  did much to repair this damage with The New York Philharmonic and now  Barenboim has in Chicago, as well as premiere ensembles,Arditti and  soloists,Chas Rosen and Ms Oppens. Schiff also always points to Carter's  extracurricular interests in literature, where he frequently finds an  impetus for a work, as well as the Italian language for a conceptual  working premise. The Glossary at the beginning also is a wonderful  clarifier, of forms we frequently hear about but seldom understand within  the context of the subsequent work these terms refer to.Ms Oppens.

Schuller has got an ax to grind here, citing laundry lists of &quot;incorrect&quot; tempi from the pantheon of conductors. Abbado is too fast, Bernstein too slow, Boulez too fast. On and on and on, like he is  piling corpses,referring that everyone is wrong, yet he is right. Schuller  is arrogant as well, claiming &quot;Brahms never meant that  tempo&quot;,claiming how stupid conductors have been by not following what  the composer had indicated. If we did that, there would be little to listen  to of interest within the classical canon. The grand masters knew nothing  of performance of their new works, they guessed at tempi many times, it has  only been through continuous performance up through today that such a thing  as tempi has come to be affix in a somewhat loose way. Schuller knows his  orchestration however with a focus upon blending of winds and strings and  the problematics, like in the opening of the First Symphony of Brahms.I had  wished he would have included a new work, even one of his own would have  been fantastic to discuss,i.e. the conducting problems of a new work.  Ravel's Daphnis &amp; Chloe is a great example which he utilizes here. That  work with string harmonics and virtuoso wind writing in multi-layered  textures is again a great example.  I suspect the editor perhaps cut out a  chapter on Ligeti or Boulez or Babbitt. He should follow-up this book with  another strictly devoted to music after 1945.	2000-04-04

While alive there was a small but devoted following. The Brits loved the utter beauty, and simplicity of his work, Composers Howard  Skempton, Cornelius Cardew, even the improv ensemble AMM speak deeply of  Feldman's influence. With this collection of analytical investigations the  rigours of academia as well now are making,staking a claim. And that's  illuminating because the Feldman aesthetic is the direct opposite of  someone  the demeanor of Elliot Carter. But herein all the creative periods  in Feldman's life are exposed with ample analytical tools of graphic  renderings. Here John Welsh discusses 'Projection 1' a modest cello solo  notated on graph paper, considered at the time of writing 1950, an  experimental piece and something gleaned from John Cage I suspect. Feldman  to my mind never had that kind of aesthetic voice for innovation. His  concern was always in the aesthetic object, its attenuation, shape, its  design and process, as opposed to Cage where the aesthtic object was a  by=product of a larger process, hence it fell or stood,depending on the  gifts and vision of the performers. Venturing forward, an important  contribution to piano literature is discussed by Paula Kopstick Ames, a  work modestly titled 'Piano&quot; from 1977, a 20 minute work where we  begin to see Feldman's interest in large scale durational values . And if  something is missing here it is an appraisal of these massivly long works  like the String Quartet, that Kronos had premiered, or 'Triadic  Memories',or 'Cryppled Symmetry', or 'For Christian Wolff' a four hour work  for flute and piano. For John Cage(1982) is well rendered with structural  definitions and charts which mark its divisions. When you see these  divisions its odd how simple it is, you always think an analysis will  preserve the complexity we hear, or didn't hear or discover a complexity to  exhibit the visual side of analysis, for let's face, this kind of academia  work is an end in itself. I know of no performers of this music who consult  analyses prior to their performative work, Like wise Elliot Carter. The  ultimate highlight here is the inclusion of three essays by Mr. Feldman  himself. He was a gifted orator, and verbal communicator. He had a gift for  interdiscipline- like approach, where he interjects concepts from  Mondrian,Tolstoi, Henri Bergmann, something now we take for granted. 'The  Anxiety of Art', is an essay and position statement, on that the American  Revolution, in art that is, the Pollock, Abstract Expressionist Revolution  which rendered New York the art world center was devoid of bloodshed, hence  no banners, and the word of subversion is only now coming through.

It was a microcosm of the most  important city in the world, the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the  twentieth century. It was the only city Benjamin preferred to live in  despite the economic hardships of a struggling writer to do that. He found  Paris at the edge of technology,much like our Silicon Valley is today,it  was the beginning of progress so to speak,but with Washington and New York  thrown in, all mixed in a fantastic quagmire of  innovation,invention,excitement,and where the old preserves the new. Layers  of cultural artifact, burdened with the scraps of histoy,all to be  explained. Iron,for instance,a building material is a focus, on  architecture and the Eiffel Tower, the feathery like weightlessness of the  mammoth black innovative girders seen just about from anywhere in Paris. It  was a step backwards for no one knew how to deveop it,simply display  conceit for the colossolness of it,much like Victorian England,its bridges  with giant sized rivits, thousands of them. Architecture, technology,  photography were all items for Benjamin to spend his imagination here,  discovering the ends of things, the values of the old. You learn French  history in great detail,with notes copied as well from 1878, The Paris  Commune is a chapter, one of revolution, as seen from a reader of  Marx,rather than a staunch Marxist. Still Benjamin drew on the the progress  of capitalism and where it fell down profoundly resulting in World Wars,  and the emergence of some of the darkest pages in European history.  Prostitutes and gambling are spoken of in one chapter, I found this boring  and just idle passage work.Literature is visited as well with profile-like  chapters on Baudelaire,the theory of knowledge, and Benjamin always  inscribes a profundity, one of those items that is a recepticle a conduit  for millions of thoughts preserved in one place.&quot;At no poin in time,  no matter how utopian, will anyone win the masses over to a higher art,  they can be won over only to one nearer to them&quot;.

We have here primary  writers,people who worked and studied directly with Nono. Composer Nicolaus  A. Huber devotes his essay to Nono's orchestral work 'A Carlo Scarpa' named  after a noted Venecian architect Nono knew. Huber dissects this work  admirably probing the discourse surfaces of the work. The polar regions of  C and Eb(in German C and S after Scarpa's initials)are focal points where  micro-intervals hover around each. Huber gives great graphic charts of  these regions timbral and pitch. There is a fascinating discussion on  Nono's re-use of the octave and the unison. With Huber a vigorous composer  himself of the miniature, we actually enter Nono's creative process  directly. Likewise  Viera de Carvalho situates Nono's political interests  and the intellectual currents of Europe that Nono's music interfaces  with,in partucular the idea of revolution and Walter Benjamin's theories on  cultural impasse. He gives exhaustive references,mostly German as an  addendum. Hans Peter Haller, a primary Nono collaborator and a musician and  technician gives us reminicence of working on Prometeo, the performance at  the Alte Oper in Frankfurt. How diagrams of the acoustic spaces were always  a focal point for Nono's work, how each space had its own unique acoustic  features. John Irvine discusses an overwhelmingly powerful work the  orchestra; Canti di vita d'amore, and the use of the palindrome, where a  melodic line develops in between amongst the instruments which Nono further  divides into numerous voices. That work was Nono's first real success. The  editor, Stephan Davismoon here gives us a fascinating interview with Andre  Richard who is editing some of Nono's music, they discuss the practical  problems in bringing Nono's music to performance.

From Eisler, Peter  Schat,,Bruno Maderna, Pierre Boulez and neglected Charles Koechlin. Here  Ferneyhough brings us right to his writing desk and we learn how he  constructs his multi-dimensional musical concoctions. Much of it has been  material provided elsewhere,but who reads it or can recall its source,from  program notes and seminal interviews with Paul Griffiths, James Boros and  Richard Toop, those who have followed Mr. Ferneyhough's career, and were  there at the birth. Well documented here are the four string Quartet. And  since the quartet is, or has been considered as special creative preserve,  Ferneyhough's thought is well focused, giving us, rendering his aesthetic  battle-plans for each. Some like the Third Quartet was more lucid and  facile,greater surface discourse relatively speaking. There are also grist  kinds of analysis, of Webern, token objects on the way toward discovery,but  analysis frequently point toward the labyrinth of creativity What you value  one place is sought after in another. We also extend into a life beyond  just placing musical loci, notes on paper, Walter Benjamin is a great  inspiration, and Ferneyhough has followed the intellectual currents of  Europe, philosophic, and cultural to be able to place his creations within  that discourse. He frequently solicits the visual world of painting for an  agenda.Also Musical excerpts abound the pages , and the impeccable  draftsmanship is a sensuous pleasure a gaze almost pornographic in its  seductiveness.	1999-12-29

Bloch's life itself well traversed almost a century,seeing himself and participating in the  early innovative artistic movements,Expressionism, the plays of  Brecht,Schoenberg's 12 Tone Dodecaphonic means. He also carried diatribes  with the likes of Gyorgy Lukacs, as well as writers he admired Anna Siegel.  Utopia is a realm that never seems to go away. For Bloch it was a way of  gaining distance with the world,in fashioning a path toward it yourself. He  said someplace that we all inhabit our own durational frames, and that we  develop, or come to see our horizons not simultaneously as we have been  taught to believe. This massive three-volume work is a mere encyclopedia  tracing where mankind has found its horizon,sometimes placing it theri  aritficially, as in art. Goethe Faust has a prominent place here as well as  early secular religions of the world, how each shares this vision of Utopia  Bloch so impassioned voice seeks. Marx is here as well, and it was Bloch  who for want of a better term, introduced the warmer side of the human  spirit to into Marxist discourse. Bloch, as Adorno,Horkheimer,even Lukacs,  were not really political animals,nor consummate players, so they each saw  the Soviet Union as some hope, less Adorno,who was skeptical of everything.  The early religious leader Thomas Munzer, Luther's arch enenmy during the  burgeoning Reformation and the Peasant Wars is also a point of reference  for Bloch. And music makes an entrance, however Bloch really never got to  know modernist repertoire, his thoughts are abssorbed with the classics,  Mozart,Beethovem Bruckner and Wagner all have places in his Utopian  edifice.	1999-12-28

Think of any composers and you will find some inner being at work, some compelling  spectre, an illdefined, undefined entity which demands the pen to continue  making music,commanding it. Harvey here is a seminal figure which unites  both these worlds, and has a grasp of the realms which interbreed, the  spirit the abstract with the tangible, music,sounds and silences. This work  is also pedagogical,like a lecture, Harvey brings us by steps through his  work, and others, Stockhausen makes an entrance.Slowly then we begin to  understand his own music, as well as those undefined particles on  experiencing music,yet feel something has escaped us. Harvey defines many  functional areas,sadly to say know very little, like spectralism. A means  of defining the inner presence of harmonies, the particles which constitute  a sound. This thinking emanates from IRCAM, the multi-million dollar  institute in Paris, where Harvey has worked since the early Eighties.  Spectralism has indeed become a fashionable movement in the cloistered  parts of the new music scene in Europe.But for us it is indeed wonderful  when a creator is able to reflect on their work, and with an affinity of  articulation for it. Here Harvey runs through the concepts which animates  his work and fosters this unity with the spirit. The concept of stasis  seems to be an ubiquitous one from the bleak world of repetitive  minimalism,now dead, to the music Harvey engages. Might I add World Music  seems a frequent and powerful player here with Western composers, the use  of alternate tuning,Asian instruments, and newly made ones as well have  engaged a great dialogue between East and West. Stasis is simply like a  drone in a simplified form, but there are other more sophisticate ways of  maintaining a non-movement. I believe this non-movement is what engages the  mind to reflection, quiets it in some circles.

Messiaen was primarily a teacher, and he taught without hesitation the post-war generation of  composers and continued this until his death. Everyone flocked to his  composition classes in Paris. And it was considered an honour to be  accepted. Once there you were his,he probed what you as a creator needed.  For instance when a young exiled architect came to his door seeking  lessons, and a pathway confessing he (Xenakis) did not have any knowledge  of counterpoint or harmony, Messiaen said &quot;don't study any of  these&quot;, meaning Xenakis had enough reserve and imagination from his  affinities for numbers and forms to write the most original music we have  heard. This touches all the musical categories, and Messiaen contributed to  each. He virtually rethought the limitations of the pipe organ. Long a  morose encumbered instrument loaded with historical baggage. John Milsom  here exposes Messiaen's unique contributions to registral settings and  Messiaen's conceptual focus of the Catholic spirituality in this organ  repertoire. Likewise Peter Hill takes on the neglected piano solo music,  again another focus of innovation for this century. Boulez's early piano  sonatas would not be possible without Messiaen's affinity for the violence  and surreal beauty that can be part of piano sonority. Other important  Messiaenism concepts are of course Colour, and Birdsongs,Mysticism and  Theology. All amply handled by Jonathan Bernard(colour) and seasoned writer  Wilfred Millers on Theology, a difficult subject when a creator's life is  engaged. Paul Griffiths brings us up to date with an essay on Messiaen's  last important work the opera &quot;St.Francis of Assisi&quot;, which is  now seeing the productions rounds. There is obvious inclusions here as well  an excellent discography and list of works. Nice vintage photographs as  well are included.	1999-12-18

They solicit the most vigorous practicioners,composers, essayists,theoreticians in the field of music.<br />Since his death in May 1990, Luigi Nono has solicited a broad following primarily in Europe perhaps the presence of his  Marxists affinities doesn't seem to bother Europeans who look beyond this more toward the content.Serious music venues in the USA seems to be the opposite, content is not as important as the cash=box value of particular music written.  We have learned to look beyond it as well, way beyond politics. Nono now is no longer an enigma. His late music is what everyone  is drawn to the incredible scope of the materials set in place, micro-intervals, new ways of bowing, timbre, register, longer lengths for sustained timbre, and spatialization as his Prometeo.If you know his early work, the suspended songs and cluster sonoricisms(Canti d'vita e d'amore) there really is no conceptual  rupture as the French are fond on saying. Helmut Lachenmann is a gifted noise composer who studied with Nono in the late Fifties. And he admirably  reflects on Nono's penchant,his sensitivity for the pure power of sound,  something which engages his own music, although not quite as orthodox as  Nono. Perhaps living in his native Venice taught Nono the mysteries of  sound, and the haunted-ness of silent spaces, of bells peeling from an unknown distance as his sofferte onde serene for piano and electronic tape(actually altered piano sounds)). Flutist Roberto Fabbriciani reflects more on a personal level, their first meeting which was simply walking and talking through  Venice all day.;\\"Not a tone was emitted\\" he said. Stabler's piece is more about  Stabler than Nono,but draws to Nono's influence on the younger generation  German composers as Stabler and Wolfgang Rihm have found in Nono a deep  reservoir. The editor here Davismoon is the most squarely analytical, the piano and tape piece is good grist for this mill again \\"serene waves  endured\\" dedicated to Maurizio Pollini is surveyed. Nono's massive  \\"Prometeo\\" is also discussed but I'd like more of this, everything  seems to be emitted in small fragments,perhaps edited rather than rendering the work in  totality. Nono has pointed to something deep within the Western tradition,  again the pure appreciation, the pure perception of sound, its contours and  internal structures in microintervals, in timbre, in its spatialization.  When spatialized as in \\"Prometeo\\" assisted by computer, we  hear/perceive sound as if under a microscope. There is another installment  publication with more Nono illuminations.
