If you are a sucker for \\"true\\" ghost stories like I am, you will be disappointed with this book.  It's mostly legends and not a lot legends at that.  I also didn't like the author's writing style (she plods on forever) The book's real title should be just plain \\"Civil War Legends\\".	2002-11-07

The science and social stucture are cumbersome to describe and Joy's description of them lack imagination.  <br />She produced a society of women have developed very sexist and elitist atitudes.  What a disappointment, I was hoping that the women would be more gentle leaders.  Also her terms describing the various titles was confusing. She should have just stuck to the feminine version of a title e.g., \\"duchess\\" and labeled the male as \\"ducal consort\\" or something simple.  She calls Claudine a \\"she-Count\\" and refers to another Top Slice member as an \\"Earlene\\".  To my knowledge, both count and earl are equal titles.  Call me a nit-picker but the title usage did bother me somewhat. Hopefully her next book will be an improvement.	2002-04-13

Her brother, the Duke of Melford is practically in the pocket of a noble Brunconian art procurer who may be in the habit of selling forgeries.  Meanwhile, the earl's royal cousin from Brunconia comes to England to court Princess Charlotte.  The Brunconian prince claims that art dealer's family stole his country's state jewels and money--- leaving Brunconia bankrupt.  Spunky Selena decides to help the prince discover the truth behind the art dealer, while falling head over heels in love with the earl and he with her. I would have given this book 4 stars if they had left the entire fictitious country of Brunconia out of the picture.  The prince was an absolute boor and the art dealer a snake.	2000-10-06

Instead she receives only 2 offers of marriage- both from old friends who had to be almost bullied into asking her.  The  story is mainly about the actions of a French spy and a British lord's  attempts to have the English military take him seriously.  I was really  dissapointed.  The title of the book should be &quot;The Eager Spy&quot;.	1999-10-07

He is one of the most hypocritical, mentally unstable characters I ever read about. He is constantly on poor Gabby's case.  He puts her on a pedestal  and then he saws it down.<br />Throughout the novel he insults her, then  apologizes-&quot;Mon amour, I'm so sorry, I don't what came over me&quot;  (kiss kiss).  It seems barely into the next scene that the abuse starts all  over again. And he wonders why she keeps running away.  I don't want to  start on his philandering.	1999-03-29

Norah Hess's characters are sometimes shallow and her plots weak, but there is one thing in her novels that annoys me to no end.  That's when she names the heroine's horse (all together now)... BEAUTY!!!<br />Every freakin'  horse can't be named Beauty.  I was actually be getting into this book  until it came to the scene concerning the horse.  I found myself holding my  breath, praying that she had given Jonty's horse a different name. I know  this sounds pretty petty, but this repetitive equine name is driving me  crazy.<br />Also, I find it hard to believe that Cord got on Jonty's case for  being effiminate, yet he allowed Paunch (a solid gold pervert) continue to  chase and harass a supposedly teenaged &quot;male&quot;.	1999-03-09

I first read this title around 15 years ago.  Recently, I was in a used bookstore and not only  found &quot;Demon&quot; but the two other books in the War of the Wizards  series.  I quickly grabbed up all three.<br />Tiana of Reme is fantastic!!!  A  red-headed swashbuckling pirate captain who ROCKS! She has a little bit of  an ego, but I can overlook that.  I loved the interaction between Tiana and  her foster-father.  I also love the interaction between her and her  adversaries.  They (male and female) have the habit to view her as a  beautiful young girl playing &quot;man&quot;.  Bad mistake-they typically  end up getting skewered.  <br />One point of concern I have is that the  authors glossed over the reason why Tiana was born illegitimate.   Certainly, if her natural father was a duke, he would have made sure that  his marriage to Tiana's mother was valid.  Lingering question: Who was her  mother?<br />Anyway back to to the story.  Tiana, who was cast off by her  relatives after her father's death, was raised by Caranga into a life of  piracy.  After a raid of a suspiciously heavily armed merchant ship, she  discovers mystical items that offer her the chance to rescue her younger  half-bother Belost (the ducal heir).  This leads to a intensive world wide  search for misssing &quot;parts&quot;.<br />The book is well written and  entertaining, even when a scene shifts from Tiana.  It would be in the  publisher's best interest to reprint the three novels in one volume (using  that original gorgeous Boris painting for the cover).	1999-01-29

I'm really upset that Anita seems to gain new powers in each new novel.  Hamilton should have used the same character devlopment found in her Nightseer book for the Anita Blake series.  The nightseer enchantress  gained a new power, but she had limits (she was also stripped of her  master's rank and sent back to school to learn control her power).  Too bad  that there's nobody around to &quot;control&quot; Anita.  If someone tried  Anita would just blow them away or develop a new &quot;power&quot; to  combat them.  However, this book is slighty better than Burnt Offerings  (horrible story).  I hope her next novel will be of the same caliber as her  first Blake books.	1999-01-28
