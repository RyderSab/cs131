Brothers Of The Gun is a continuation of Cotton Smith's, Dark Trail To Dodge. This is a fabulous story of revenge, friendship and the complexity of family.

Overall I enjoyed this book, but the ending is where I had problems, very vague and it just fizzled out. Maybe I just didn't get what the author was trying to say, and I could see two possible ways the story could end. Not distinct enough. I did like Sean MacDonald and Pamela and I could feel their pain and frustration over the ghost. Donald Beman has a strong writing style and I would definitely read more of his books. Not a perfect book, but still enjoyable.	2002-02-15

Bounty Hunter Asa Cain and Deputy Cemetery John set out to rescue Cain's mother and sister from the Dolven gang. They run into all kinds of trouble and interesting people. Humor and laughs are sprinkled along the way. The rappor between Asa and Cemetery is very well done. The friendship that developes between them warms the heart.  Ken Hodgson is one terrific writer and never lets the reader down. Hard Bounty goes on my all-time favorite westerns shelf.	2002-01-05

Another classic Clay Cole western, brimming with heart and heartbreak. Cole is asked to take an orphan Indian baby girl home to her native lands. Always on the run for a crime he didn't commit, Cole is a man of valor and honor, a decent and kind person, with all the odds stacked against him. His love for the baby is heartwarming and touching. He runs into racism and bounty hunters, but he perseveres. Not every day I read a book with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. McGuire is a great writer and I feel he should win the Spur award for Outcasts. Bravo!	2001-12-09

Skye Fargo is up against Duke Wolfrik from Transia, who is trying to create a utopia in Montana. He creates his own town and controls the people who live there. Fargo teams up with the Flathead tribe, whom Wolfrik wants to destroy. An exciting story with alot of action and a colorful opponent for Fargo.

Stealth Striker is a rock em sock em, first rate bang up job! The writer Dan Schmidt always creates a good Bolan story, but he excels on this one. Mack Bolan is in Utah, to stop ex-military commandos who have a nasty plague they are about to unleash on innocent Americans. Bolan is in top form as he wages war on the leader Paxson and his commandos. Paxson is a great villian, as in the nut job variety. The Utah setting adds alot to the mood and action.

Overholser's last western is a joy to read and a fitting tribute to an outstanding talent. Del Delaney is accused of a crime he didn't commit and he takes to the outlaw trail, so to speak. He is a good man, and the story revolves around this. Overholser casts his spell with strong characterizations and vivid writing. A fond farewell from this great western writer.	2001-08-06

I don't want to give any of the story away, because it is wonderful and different. There is also a horror element that runs throughout, that gives the characters in the book strong dimensions. I hope Tracy Knight writes more westerns. Beneath A Whiskey Sky is the most unique western I have ever read.	2001-06-19

Someone wants Clint Adams DEAD, and he has to find out who. I have read some negative comments on this series and I disagree. Sure, the books are quick reads, but they deliver. Robert J. Randisi is a talented and accomplished author, who has written all the books in the series. Some are better than others, but they all have a unique guality that separates them from other western series of this type. Give them a try, The Gunsmith draws fast and shoots straight.	2001-06-05

Barjack is still the marshal in the town of Asininity. A known gunfighter called the Widowmaker shows up for a rest, and the fun begins. Great dialogue, told from Barjacks view on life, keeps the story moving and you feel like you are right there with Barjack, Bonnie Boodle, Happy and all the gang. A different slant to the western, but what a wonderful detour.	2001-04-23

When I started reading this book, I was expecting something different. Dolf Morgette is this larger than life gunfighter and the cover art is full of guys shooting at each other, but by the time I reached the end I was disappointed. I expected a dramatic ending with lots of shooting and excitement, but the author went for a calmer approach, that was lacking for me. This novel is well written and clever, with some good humor and suspense. The characters are well developed and funny at times. I suppose I was expecting too much. Still a worthy read for the unique style it offers.	2001-03-26

Every word is perfect and the story is incredible. Marshal John Rye helps an ex-Texas Ranger rescue another ranger who is being held captive by Comancheros down in Mexico. The people are so well developed, you feel like you know them. There is a haunting quality to the story and some unexpected turns. Ray Hogan is a master of the western novel.

I had never heard of David Shifren before, and I didn't know what to expect. Wow!, what a novel! This is a wonderful story that reminded me of the classic westerns from the 1950's. A good, clean written western with a strong hero Will Clay, who is looking for a new life, and when he finds a family that he cares about and they need his help, the bad guys better watch out. Clay's Justice is a modern classic western, that takes the reader on a journey that you will not forget. Marvelous!	2000-12-15

Clint Adams arrives at a town that is plagued by a strange disease. The story moves along and The Gunsmith does his best to help. A sub plot developes and turns into an unexpected ending.

The small town, a satanic cult, lots of weird people and strange occurrences. Jantzen is a good guy who is tortured by his past and when that past catches up to him, he has to deal with it. I feel the ending was to short and I wish it had been developed more. The Demon Circle isn't perfect, but it is fun to read.	2000-11-28

I thought this book was terrific! I bought the book because of the cover art and the story sounded interesting. This is the first Harlequin book I have ever read and it was so much better than I thought it would be. Brady and Grace make a great team and they get into one fix after another. Their being reunited and the romance that reawakens between them was well done and believable. I would recommend this book to other men, who like action, adventure and romance. Very enjoyable.	2000-11-20

There wasn't one flaw or boring part in the whole book. Micah Ward is a preacher who is mistaken for a gunfighter.

This Super Bolan novel grabbed me from the first page, and I had a hard  time putting it down. Bolan's nemisis is Trevor Garth, the leader of The  Minutemen militia. He gets hold of TL-14, to use against American citizens.  The opening prologue, is my favorite of all the Bolan books. Colorful  action sequences. Ren Starkey, is like a gunfighter from the old west.  David Robbins is my favorite Bolan writer and he sure delivers on Code Of  Conflict.	2000-08-25

Nate King's son Zach and his fiancee Louisa, go to St. Louis so Zach can meet her relatives.  They have troubles, and they find out how corrupt cities can be. Nate King  is mentioned in the book, but isn't in it. Zach King is grown up now, and  faces life on his own. This adds to the series, and doesn't take anything  away. I liked reading about St. Louis and the author David Robbins does a  great job of capturing the feel of that era. Enjoyable book in the high  quality Wilderness series.	2000-08-25

Clint Adams helps his friend, Chief Inspector from Scotland Yard, by  watching over one of his detectives, when he comes to New York to hunt for  a killer. Adams has his hands full in this one.

He is cocky, rude and arrogant. At the same time he is likable. This book has alot of twists and turns, and you never know what is going to happen next.  Just when you think you know what the heck is going on, it takes you  somewhere else. Barjack is an offbeat western, that should appeal to  anyone, not just western fans. There are some hilarious parts, that had me  laughing out loud. Robert Conley really changed his writing style on this  one, and it worked.	2000-06-21

He finds an archeologist and her partners wandering in the desert looking for lost Aztec treasure. They hire Cole to protect them.
