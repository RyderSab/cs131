So many reviews have discussed the plotline that I don't need to go over it again.  Some people like the ending and some think it ruins the story.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I was listening to the ending of this book while on my way to work and arrived in tears.  If you think that it's sad reading, it's much more devastating hearing the last few chapters read aloud.   <br /> <br />A touching book with a interesting concept and plot.   <br /> <br />Recommended as an Audio Book.	2005-01-14

The book is narrated by full cast (a different person narrating the three main characters).  The narration is spectacular.  All three characters, Joyce, Margaret and Faulkner have very separate voices, personalities, and ages.  The actresses who do the narration are not listed on the jacket but if you can get a copy of the audio version of this book, you will not be dissapointed.   <br /> <br />I would not necessarily have taken this book out of the library (as it is a Griot book which is targeted to an African-American audience, which I am not) but picked it up because the premise was one I could relate to.  Once I started listening to the story, I couldn't wait to get back into the car to hear more. <br /> <br />The other reviews summarize the plot very well - 3 different women work for a phone company in Texas - all in customer service.  Margaret, an older woman in her 50's, is still in the same job she's held her entire career; Joyce has risen the corporate ladder to executive and Faulkner is a rising star and on her way to take over Joyce's job. <br /> <br />Margaret is actually the most interesting character of the three women.  She has health problems and children problems and doesn't really put herself first, which does cause even more problems for her. <br /> <br />Faulkner is bright and likeable and ambitious but in a \\"good\\" way - she's not too ambitious - she's not cutthroat or devious.  She is a good daughter, a good worker, probably every parent's dream. <br /> <br />Joyce is the villian of the novel - she is portrayed as manipulative, evil, and aggressively bitchy - however, she does have a deep dark secret (that actually is relatively easy to figure out earlier in the book).  There is one relationship that comes with Joyce's story that did take me by surprise but the wrap up of her ending is why I've given the book only 4 stars instead of 5.  Didn't ring quite true. <br /> <br />If you've not been able to get through the written book, try the audio version.  Highly recommended. <br />	2004-10-01

Usually a book is weakened by having the author read his or her own work - while Les Roberts does an adequate job, he still stumbles over many words and voices the male characters much better than the female characters.  Still, he has a commanding personality and Milan Jacovich sounded real coming out of Mr. Roberts' mouth.<br />The premise of this book was very good.  Flyers are found all around Sherman College's campus proclaiming Jason Crowell as a rapist by a group called the Women Warriors.  The victim does not go to the police but but accuses him anonymously through the flyers.  He is thought by everyone, including his own father, to be guilty.  Then, a murder occurs, tied into Jason and a large amount of heroin is found in Jason's apartment - he is beginning to look like a really bad guy.  He continues to declare his innocence and Milan Jacovich, former cop, now a private investigator, takes on the case as a favor to his best friend.<br />I had no problem with anything happening in the plot until Jacovich finds the alleged rape victim and interviews her.  At that point, Mr. Roberts totally insults the reader/listener by not doing the obvious - asking the rape victim to describe her attacker. He asks if she remembers what kind of car he drove and what happened, but at no point during the interview does he ask her to describe Jason or does he show her a picture of him.  The case could have ended right there if he had done what any third grader would have done -- asked the right questions.<br />This is a quick listen (only 4 tapes) - probably a full length version of the story is the better way to go if you want to do the audio instead of the read.	2003-10-13

For example, neighbour, colour, humour were used.  Curb (as in sidewalk) was spelled Kerb.  Mr was printed in many places without the period following the &quot;r.&quot;  As a stickler for punctuation when I am reading, I found this to be enough of a problem that it took away some of the enjoyment of the book.<br />In any case, I agree with the other review who says that the first and the third stories are good and the second is ridiculous (and boring).  Father's Day is the best of the three, dealing with a young widow, her adorable, precocious son and the smoldering handsome, aloof next door neighbor who is mysterious, yet alluring.  Good, easy to read romance.<br />I like Debbie Macomber's novels better than her short stories and recommend Thursdays at Eight if you want to read her better work.	2003-07-23

However, I continued to be a fan of Rona Jaffe's and read all of her subsequent books and was usually entertained with a good story and interesting characters.<br />Unfortunately, The Room-Mating Season is neither a good story nor does it have compelling characters.<br />By reading the synopsis, it seems that the book is about 4 girls coming of age in New York City in the early 60's and continuing with their lives through present day (a great premise).   Actually, it is really about 3 of the women and one male friend.  I found the lead female character, Cady Fineman, so pathetically needy, so filled with jealousy, so immature and unlikeable, that every time a chapter started about Cady, I wanted to skip it.  <br />What amazed me about all of the women in this book is how they so blithely had affairs with married men - and not only were they married men, but they were also much, much older married men (20 years older than the girls).  It seems to me like Rona Jaffe has a fixation with older men and younger women.  (And thinking back to \\"The Fame Game\\" it was also about a much older man having affairs with very young women.)  Does she have a father/daughter complex?<br />With the exception of Leigh, the most stable woman in the group, the other characters do not mature or grow wiser with age.  They mourn the loss of their youth because they are not beautiful or desirable to men anymore. Cady ends up desperately trying to pick up younger men to have sex with and Vanessa, because she is no longer desirable to strangers in bars, decides to have an affair with the one man in her life who has always loved her (even though she has the depth of a pickle chip).<BR> <BR>This book is so lightweight, it could fly away on a balloon.  <br />This book can be read over the course ofa weekend and if I had read this book as a 16 year old, I probably would have liked it.  More mature readers however, will probably be disappointed.	2003-06-10

If these stories are really true, then it's amazing that he got out of adolesence still alive!  You're laughing while you're hurting for Paul - it's a quick, easy read - entertaining in a sort of sick kind of way - sort of like watching a car accident - you don't want to watch but you can't take your eyes away!<br />If you liked the show \\"Freaks and Geeks\\" then by all means, read this book.

I picked up this book in the library without realizing that it was Christian fiction (not something I would normally be interested in reading).  I was pleasantly surprised that the plot was good - the characters believable and I feel I got a good understanding of how the Christian clergy leads their ministry.<br />Because the ending was a bit weak (not as good as the other 9/10ths of the book), I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5.  I was a bit sorry to see the story end - even at 500+ pages, it was never boring.	2003-03-17

The plot has certainly been told by other reviewers so I won't go into it. <br />What I liked about the book was the &quot;realness&quot; of the characters - and the one that was the truest to me was the stepmonster, Sydelle.  I know so many women like Sydelle - who would rather be dead than overweight - who try to so delicately hint to you - oh - &quot;we're having chocolate pudding for dessert but I know ___ doesn't want any - we girls are always watching!&quot;  Kind of makes you gag doesn't it?  She is the type of older, bag of bones woman of a certain age who just refused to accept that she's not 25 and cute anymore.  I loved how Maggie and Rose referred to Sydelle's daughter as &quot;MyMarcia&quot; because Sydelle always said Marcia's name like that - parts of this book are just laugh out loud funny.  SPOILER -- Even though she only makes a marginal appearance, Marcia turning into a &quot;Jews for Jesus&quot; convert who still breastfeeds her 4-year old twins is a howl!<br />I thought the book was too short - I would have liked to learn what happens to Ella and Lewis and to Maggie.  You know that Rose will turn out just fine - she is the most normal of all of the characters in the book.  Maggie gets her act together but you know she'll slip back into her old behavior at some point and it would be nice to visit these characters in a few years to see how they've turned out.<br />Can't wait for the author's 3rd book - though now that she's pregnant in real life - it may be a longer wait than usual.	2002-12-09

The one sister also admits that she tried to help kill her other sister.  And that's just by page 11!  <br />How can you not go on reading?  The writing is a breeze - this is an easy book to read - better than a stale Steele!<br />Read it just for entertainment purposes - not for any deep meaning.  This is a great book to read when you are busy doing other things (like getting ready for the holidays) because it gives you a break from the real world for a while!	2002-11-25

Yes, we all know how to lose weight - eat less - exercise more.  I had thought that this would be an original, amusing take on losing weight - from a real person who was out there in the trenches - and actually lost weight.  <br />What I read was name dropping of all of the author's famous friends and Mr. Victor listing every diet under the sun and being told to pick the parts you like from each one.  The book was relatively boring from the middle of the book to the end.  <br />I applaud Ed Victor for actually losing the weight and keeping it off.  However, this book is not going to help the rest of us until we have enough willpower to stop eating dairy, wheat, fat and sugar (which is soooooooo hard to do).	2002-11-12

Just when you think you have heard of them all - another one pops us.  Half brothers, brothers, biological mother, adoptive mother, adoptive brother etc. etc. etc.   ...  Lots of characters to keep track of in this new mystery by Faye Kellerman.  It has a lot of Peter Decker in it - not too much Rina - which was a disappointment.  Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, there are a lot of Jewish phrases in this book and a lot to learn about Chasidism (which I found very interesting).  The most interesting character in the story is Christopher Donatti, a fascinating psychopath - you hate and admire him at the same time.  I'm sure he will crop up again in another story.<br />This story does keep your attention and you do want to keep reading to find out what happens but it's not as good as some of Kellerman's earlier works.	2002-10-23

My parents live in Beachwood, Ohio - they go to Corky & Lenny's and I am too too familiar with Beachwood Mall!  Plus, not only is the neighborhood familiar, the people seem to be also!  <br />Jane Horowitz is not plain - she is real - not a girl yet not yet a woman (thank's Britney!) - she's a middle child - constantly being overshadowed by her beautiful older sister Caroline and putting up with her pathological liar younger brother, Willy.  Instead of going to college (even though she was valedictorian of her high school class), she works as a secretary to her therapist (whom she secretly has a crush on).  She is engaged to a man she can barely stand but just doesn't know what to do with her life.  <br />Eve Horowitz writes this book in a female \\"Holden Caulfied\\" type of way - except that the characters are Jewish and live in Ohio instead of NY.  There are plenty of NY references though as Jane's sister is marrying an orthodox man (who's lifestyle is as alien to Jane's family as her family is to their's).<br />The only disappointment is that the author seems to have only written this one book.

Amazon suggests it as a book for young adults - which I take to mean high school students - 15 or older.  There is nothing in this book that is even remotely offensive.  It deals with abuse of a 17-year old boy from his drunken father, spousal abuse - Davy's mother is forced to flee after almost being beaten to death by her husband and one tender, touching sex scene were more is implied than written about when Davy loses his virginity to a wonderful college girl about 3 years older than he.<br />This book is the type of book that even non-SF readers (myself included) enjoy.  The pace is fast and you do feel so much empathy with Davy - his life is pretty bad and he tries to make it better the best way he can - not always legally - but with an honest heart.  You just know he is a good kid.<br />The teleportations are wonderful - to be able to jump from place to place in an instant - how amazing is that?  <br />Highly recommended for ages 15 and above - and for both SF and non SF readers.	2002-10-03

Chip steals $78 worth of salmon by stuffing it down his pants in a high priced NY deli - this section of the book made me laugh out loud; ABSOLUTELY REVOLTING... Alfred has hours of conversation with, how should I put this delicately, a piece of fecal matter that has mysteriously rolled out of his adult diaper; SYMPATHETIC ... Chip is forced to sit at a dinner table for hours until he eats his dinner of liver, mashed rutabaga and beet greens and finally falls asleep on his plate; TEDIOUSLY BORING ... Enid's and Alfred's conversation on their cruise with their Norwegian dinner companions is reminiscent of watching other people's home movies ...and many other different adjectives will certainly come to your mind while you are reading.<br />While to me, this book is not the 5-star masterpiece that some reviewers have rated, it is certainly not the horrible book that others have lambasted as the worst book ever written.  It is certainly worth reading and many parts are very entertaining.  Others come a bit too close for comfort - almost like the author was hovering near your family for inspiration!<br />The narrator for the Recorded Books on Tape version does deserve 5 stars - he is amazing and gives every character a different, distinctive voice.  If you haven't been able to get through the book reading it, it might be better to listen to it on tape.	2002-09-14

The author of this book truly is an amazing woman.  Her son, to his teachers and non-family members, is spoiled, stubborn and behaves inappropriately.  He won't stand in line with the other children unless the teacher gives him a cracker, he won't color inside the lines (practically a criminal activity according to his kindergarten teacher) and lacks motor skills that most children his age have mastered.  Blaze is a child that would rather starve to death than take one bite of a sandwich because \\"he doesn't like sandwiches.\\"  Not that he's ever tried one - he just knows he doesn't like them.  It was only after reading about how the author tried to forcefeed him a cheese sandwich, that I truly understood what she was going through with her son, whom she loves more than anyone else in the world.  <br />Because of Ms. Ginsberg's somewhat unconventional upbringing, she was raised to mistrust and dislike doctors.  If she had been brought up in a more mainstream way, she might have immediately sued the pants off the hospital and doctors for failing to give her a C-section (which might have prevented her son from being born without enough oxygen to his brain).   However, her family is incredibly unique and interesting and supportive of each other.  It's a shame that all families are not like that.<br />In her own way, Debra Ginsberg is as stubborn as Blaze.  When a teacher at school tells her that Blaze responds positively to getting M&M's, she instructs the teacher to stop giving him sugar.  When more than one professional suggests trying Ritalin, she reacts as if she were asked to give her son cyanide.  When a 2nd grade teacher again suggests that Blaze needs to be in Special Ed because his behavior is just too inappropriate for the rest of the class, she's upset because one teacher with 25 kids in a class doesn't have time to give her son the personal attention he demands.   Ms. Ginsberg does not portray herself sympathetically in the book.  (At times, while reading thebook, I wanted to ask her  \\"Who is the parent here?  You or your son?\\" For example, Blaze gives her a list of words that she can and cannot say - does she say to him - you're 9 years old - I'm the parent, you're the child and you cannot tell me what words I'm allowed to say - No - she tries not to say any of words - which include, among others,  NO and VERY and NONFICTION).  <br />What she does do is fight tooth and nail for her son and I do give her a lot of credit for that.  <br />Does this book make you think?  Yes.  Does this book make you understand more fully what it's like to raise a \\"different\\" type of child?  Absolutely.  Is it worth reading?  Without question.	2002-08-28

This is a review of the abridged audiobook version of this story.  <br />In the beginning, it was enjoyable - Myra, a 51 year old wallflower has become a nurse and while her life is not exciting, it is livable.  She has her own home, an absolutely wonderful dog named Frank and a Porsche.  She no longer works in a hospital setting but visits homebound patients who can't live without her.  While she did seem believable in the beginning, she quickly escalated into \\"Saint Myra\\" mode - dealing with all of her patients problems, taking a 98-year old woman (who also still volunteers in the library and has just applied for a job at the local bookstore) to the movies, counseling a 15-year old on whether or not she should put her baby up for adoption, going into horrible neighborhoods and befriending gunshot victim drug dealers, and does all this while taking her dog with her to visit the patients in their homes.  I rather liked the dog!<br />What Myra does regret is that she never had a chance to be with the boy of her dreams - Chip Reardon (horrible name for a grown man).  Lo and behold, who is her newest patient - good old Chip who just happens to be dying of a brain tumor and actually wants to die rather than fight to hold on and go through aggressive cancer treatment.  And what does St. Myra do?  Not only does she take Chip on as a patient, she lets him move into her home with her.  And then, to elevate her status as the most used female in the entire United States, she invites Chip's former girlfriend - the senior high prom queen, most beautiful girl in the school to come visit and even lets them make love in the house while Myra is in her bedroom, feeling forlorn. <br />I understand feeling empathy and sympathy for a character in a book, but perhaps because this book was abridged, Myra came across as being unbelievable, naive and used instead of compassionate and loving.  However, the abridged version is short - only 5 tapes and perhaps the depth of the book was cut out.	2002-06-26

Who cares if the plot is somewhat implausible and if she doesn't quite tie up all the loose threads...

They are all 21 years old and none are native New Yorkers.  They bond quickly as they share stories and a birthday cake for a few hours in their lives.<br />Skip to their 40th birthday and one of the girls, who has in the meantime become a rich and famous author, decides to find these two other women to share her 40th birthday with.  Of course, she finds them with no problem and of course, they decide to meet her in northern New England to get away from their lives for a few days.<br />As this book is somewhat of a time travel book, anyone who is used to that genre knows what will happen.  The women are given a chance to relive 3 weeks of their life - and then decide if they want to change their life to the new one or stay with the old.<br />The book is fun to read and one that gets passed along just because you know your friends will like it too.  <br />If you like books where the main characters get to relive the past, I highly recommend &quot;This Body&quot; by Laurel Doud.	2002-06-14

The writing is very amusing and the author will make you laugh.  Basically, however, is does admit that losing weight is very, very hard and this is a refreshing change from all of the diet books that say do this and do that and you will be thin and happy.  Professor Watson's diet is to stick to 900 calories a day until the day you've lost all the weight you want to lose - stick to it - whether it takes 10 months or 10 years.  After you lose the weight - start running - every day.  This book is no different from other books in the message - eat less, exercise more - but the writing is funny, clever and charming and should be read as humor rather than as a basis for life change.	2002-06-05

After waiting for many years to follow the continued journey of Ayla and Jondalar, we get a book that could have been written in a lot less time than 12 years - maybe 12 months!  <br />The first 350 pages of the book are pure filler - endless repetitions of greetings and titles - information from the first few books - in truth, absolutely nothing happens during the first 350 pages.  But, even though the story picks up after page 350, it seems rushed - so much more could have been said in a lot fewer pages.  The whole book seems like an introduction to book 6 and the final chapter of the Jondalar/Ayla saga. <br />Yes, I will buy book 6; however, if a new reader were to pick up SOS, he or she would not understand why faithful readers were so excited about this book being published - it just doesn't capture the original exciting story of Ayla and Jondalar.  And, if I were a new reader, it certainly wouldn't make me want to read the first few books to see what the fuss was about.	2002-05-21

It's a sweet story that will make you laugh.<br />While other reviewers have praised the author for her narration, in my view, it is why I gave the book only 3 stars.  Her voice is extremely pleasant - sweet and charming - just like Julie Roseman's voice should be - however, she does not change her voice or tone at all when reading the other characters and it is difficult at times to distinguish who is speaking.  Also, in the recorded book version I was listening to, the balance and loudness of the narration swayed - at times I could barely hear what she was saying - at others, I was forced to turn down the volume.  <br />I've read (listened) to other recorded books where the author is the narrator and they almost always fall short.  It pays to spend the money to get a professional book reader to narrate your book.<br />But, even with the above comments, this is a recommended title for a quick, easy listen.	2002-03-06

(I borrowed it from my local libary but it is available at RecordedBooks.com) <br />Christina Moore provides the perfect voice for Clara winter, the most delightful protagonist I've met in a long time.  Alison McGhee has written about a very precocious child - yet not a child who is obnoxious or too adult.  All of the other reviews of this book are great and give excellent summaries of the plot  and my 5-star rating acknowledges the other reviews.  However, by listening to this wonderful story on tape, it is almost as if you were listening to Clara herself read the pages of her diary - I truly did not want this book to end.	2002-02-06

Any woman who is in her 40's who has had a marriage that didn't quite live up to her dreams will find a soul mate in Maggie Sweet.  Always doing the right thing and being a good girl doesn't mean that life is fair.  It isn't.  Maggie suddenly comes to that realization when she hears that her first and only true love is coming back into town for their 20 year high school reunion.  All of sudden, Maggie realizes that her safe secure marriage is nothing more than being stuck with a boring old pretentious cheapskate - and his absolutely horrible snob of a mother.<br />While the different quirky characters are not unique (you'll recognize the town gossip, the spinster schoolmarms, the best friend with a heart as big as gold) - they are entertaining and the story is told in a very charming way - it's a wonderful little story about coming of age (no matter what your age is).

I actually listened to the full version, not the unabridged, from RecordedBooks (that is not read by the author) so I can't comment on Nicholas Sparks' own recording.  However, the version I did listen to was entertaining, sweet and sad.  The main character of Landon Carter is a bit naive but this is set in the 1950's, not today.  Teenagers were nicer and more trusting 40 years ago.  The main character of Jamie Sullivan is a cross between Joan of Arc and Melanie Wilkes and manages to get exactly what she wants without ever being demanding.  She is a very &quot;good&quot; person as the author tells us over and over again.  Landon is actually the more interesting of the two people because he does go through somewhat of a life change and matures by the end of the book. <br />The audio is not long - about 5 tapes - and worth listening to if you get a chance.	2002-01-14

Needless to say, I didn't get it back any time soon.  She loved it and recommended it to many of her friends.  I loved that the main character wasn't a drug addict - did well in school - was active in sports - and didn't feel the need to have sex as an extra-curricular activity yet was still a &quot;cool&quot; kid and not an unpopular dweeb.  <br />We are both looking forward to the next novel starring Jessica Darling.	2001-10-02

I have to agree with the majority of the reviewers about Rona Jaffe's new book, &quot;The Road Taken.&quot;  After so many wonderful stories, I was very excited to see that she had a new book published and doubly excited to see that it was about a multi-generational family.  <br />However, just telling stories about a family does not a book make.  There is no plot - just bits and pieces of information about family members.  In reality, this book could be the story of anyone's family - my own in fact - but that doesn't make it story worthy.  Every family is dysfunctional in its own way and Rose's family certainly has its share of dysfunctionality but the storyline doesn't go any where and I didn't really get the feeling of connecting with the characters though I really tried.   There is one touching moment where Rose's wonderful husband passes away in his sleep and my favorite character in the novel, Uncle Hugh, the lovable, accepting and non-judgemental cross-dresser is by far the most interesting character.<br />This is a book that can be read in less than a day but I kept waiting for something to happen.	2000-10-31

While he is a good narrator, he was incapable of pronouncing the word &quot;room&quot; which he pronounced as &quot;rum.&quot;  For some reason, this bothered me to the point that every time he said &quot;rum&quot; instead of &quot;room,&quot; which happened every few minutes, I was ready to pull out the tape and chuck it!  Also, the voice he used for one of the main characters (Merrick) sounded exactly like Arnold Schwarzegger!  I'm not kidding about this. <br />Back to the story - it was no &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; but it certainly was head and tails above &quot;Airframe.&quot;  If you like mysteries set in medieval times, you will enjoy this book.  There is just enough computer-geek technology to keep it exciting and enough historical background to make you feel like you've learned something when you finish.	2000-10-04

I'm not too familiar with the author's &quot;Prey&quot; novels, but I certainly enjoyed this one.  The main character, Kidd (no first name) and his cohort, LuEllen, investigate the murder of one of Kidd's computer colleagues.

I'm at a loss to understand some of the absolutely scathing, negative reviews from some of the other readers.  Here  is a stay-at-home mom, dealing with a young child and a set of twins, while  at the same time dealing with her mother's diagnosis of cancer and that the  fact that she (the author) never wanted to grow up and be a &quot;domestic  goddess&quot; but rather, a painter, a writer, a skinny person in black,  living in a garrett in France.  I've been there and so have many of my  friends.  The stories she relates about the jewish holidays are right on  track, as are the stories about different relatives.<br />Jennifer Moses is  funny.

Unfortunately, the wealth did not bring  happiness.  Her mother, whom she was constantly trying to please, was cold  and aloof and her father, who Ms. Krantz adored, was more interested in his  many mistresses than he was his children.  <br />The book is written in a  friendly, almost chatty way.  I felt that I got to know a little bit about  the author - the good parts of her life anyway - she left out anything bad  happening and even put a somewhat sunny glow on alcoholism and abortion.   The only time I got the impression that her life was not going as expected  was when she discussed her first boyfriend (a total jerk) who sexually  molested her at the age of 15.  <br />Yet, the book is very enjoyable.  I  would recommend it.	2000-07-11

We were all riveted to the story but it was a bit frightening for my 11 year old.  The author has a way of really making you connect with the characters and their feelings.  At first, it  seemed like there were so many different people (all with their own views  and thoughts) that I didn't think we would remember them all.  Didn't  happen.

The narrative was enhanced by having one reader narrate Bo's letters to Larry King and another reader narrate the other parts of the story.  It worked  very well and brought the listener into Bo's thoughts and feelings about  growing up as a teenager in a dysfunctional family.  <br />Not having been a  teenager for many years (but having 2 of my own), I found it to be honest  and realistic.  There are so many instances of rage in today's world --  Anger Management class seems to be a great form of therapy for high school  students who can't control their rage.  While Bo doesn't quite show his  rage in a physically destructive way, his life is enhanced by the people  and mentors he meets while attending Anger Management.<br />Highly recommend  this book.	2000-06-14

They manage to spirit the &quot;mother&quot; out of Israel and  hide her in a basement of a homeless shelter in New York City.  <br />Of  course, everyone is after the body - but the ending is a bit surprising and  not everyone is who you think he is.  <br />Quick read and hard to put down.	2000-06-06

It amazes me that John Grisham is a bestselling author while Greg Iles is exactly what he describes in this book - a mdedium selling author with a following but no John Grisham!<br />This book will keep you guessing.  The  main character is sympathetically portrayed - a young widower raising his  daughter alone - who decides to move home to mom and dad to give his  daughter and his life some stability.  Lo and behold, he enters into a web  of deceit, corruption, blackmail and murder - and that's just day one!   <br />Even J. Edgar Hoover is brought back into play, along with his horrible  henchmen.  You get a good feel for life in Natchez with this book.

For the masses who thought that &quot;Love Story&quot; was great writing.  At least I won't waste any money seeing the movie.   <br /> There are so many wonderful books out there that it astounds  me that a book like &quot;Message&quot; is considered &quot;great.&quot;	1999-03-09
US	52210686	R3C368DHT6BIMZ	0966512707	14346332	The Lizard and the Fly	Books	2	0	0	N	Y	Totally agree with Captain Midnight!	While this author can tell a story (though he meanders and is inconsistant), the lack of editing, the horrible proofreading and the sloppy typeface of the printing took away from the story.  Using the word  &quot;breath&quot; when the author obviously meant to say  &quot;breathe&quot; was annoying.  <br />I also bought the book on a  recommendation from a stranger and based on the strong reviews from other  readers.  I guess they must all be relatives of the author!<br />Don't waste  your money.	1999-03-05

This was a story that was too short -- can't wait to read the next installment.	1999-03-05
US	52210686	R3FTKQC427N9LV	0912697172	970074876	Raney	Books	3	2	7	N	N	Stereotypical characters but nonetheless amusing	Being a liberal from the North, I kind of get the feeling that this book stereotypes conservative Christians from the South.  Raney seems much too conservative for a 24-year old in the early 70's.  It seems odd to think  that she wouldn't know anything about the Episcopal church or vegetarians.   Also, she is so close-minded about everything from sex to religion to food,  that it seems hard to understand why Charles would choose a woman so  opposite him for his wife.  I also felt  that some of the women were  portrayed as absolute idiots - and almost everyone in Raney's family were  bigots.<br />Even with those thoughts, the book (I listened to  it on tape)  was enjoyable if a bit dated for the 90's.	1998-12-17
US	52210686	R1D06X6CVRUGI5	0915230151	227982398	The Mirror	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wonderful book to read and re-read	I read this book many years ago and always checked it out of the library once or twice every few years.  Recently, at the library's book sale, they had a copy on the tables for only 50 cents which I picked up immediately.   I love this book!  It is romantic and funny and endearing.  The characters  keep your attention and anyone who enjoys time travel fiction will enjoy  this book.	1998-12-09
US	52210686	R2MBHYPFCYM4QM	0609603094	65494243	The Jewels of Tessa Kent	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Same old, same old	You always know what you will get with a Judith Krantz novel ... beautiful women, sexually charged teenagers, token lesbians, relationships where the woman gives up almost all for her man and who, of course, wouldn't love her  anymore if he knew her deep dark secret ... and of course, a child named  Daisy.  Does Judith Krantz think the name Daisy is a good name? Also, it  sends a message that it's better to die beautiful than to go to steps to  possibly prolong life (and lose your hair) if you have cancer.  While  reading this book, I could have sworn I had read the same lines before in  one of her earlier books.  This book is junk food and candy -- quickly  read, not too filling and just as soon forgotten.	1998-10-29
US	52210686	R18J70NW3L692B	0312180918	828594561	Eleven Hours	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Doesn't measure up to other books by same author	Paullina Simons said she wrote this book very quickly and it is obvious.   While she captures your attention from the first page, it quickly becomes  reminiscent of other &quot;kidnap&quot; books.  I found it amazing that the  FBI would let her husband tag along the entire search - that seemed  unbelievable.  You never feel that you know the characters.  Her other two  books, Red Leaves and Tully were much better and I highly recommend them.	1998-10-08
US	52210686	RFF30MCOTLTW6	1561003263	450524513	Red Leaves	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Enthralling listening pleasure	Listening to the audio version of &quot;Red Leaves&quot; was both exciting  and disturbing.  While the plot is reminiscent of Tartt's &quot;Secret  History,&quot; it is much more of a pyschological mystery.  Simons leaves  you wanting more and more and at times, the pace seems achingly slow... I  kept thinking... hurry up and speak faster - I want to know what's going  on!  This is one book that is better on tape than it is reading -- a  definite &quot;page turner!&quot;	1998-09-25
US	52210686	R15DHOMF71NJW7	0449911020	285378245	The First Horseman	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Doesn't match up to &quot;The Genesis Code&quot;	After devouring &quot;The Genesis Code&quot; in one sitting, I was  delighted to find a second novel by anonymous author John Case.   Unfortunately, instead of not being able to put the book down, I had to  force myself to pick it up.  It starts out interestingly enough but the  plot bogs down with same-old, same-old stuff about cults taking over the  world.  Wait for the paperback!	1998-09-25
