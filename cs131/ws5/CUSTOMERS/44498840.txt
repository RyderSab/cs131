It provides a history of writing -- how words and images have been presented around the world for millennia -- and proposes a renaissance for the future. <br /> <br />After savoring hundreds of the color images in _Goodbye Gutenberg_, you may think, This is gorgeous, but what's the point? Ms. Kirschenbaum answers that question systematically, articulately, and passionately. Quite frankly, she is intent on revolution. In attempt to stem the decline in reading and literacy (recently documented in Reading at Risk, a National Endowment for the Arts survey), she hopes to eliminate the dichotomy that has developed between literature and art, between word and image. <br /> <br />She makes a strong case, showing how word and image were married in various civilizations dating back to ancient Egypt. The Chinese, for example, had poetry, painting, and calligraphy done by the same person. The Maya had one word, \\"ts'ib,\\" that referred to painting, drawing, and writing; word and image were one. During the Middle Ages, manuscripts were painstakingly and elaborately illustrated and colored by hand. Of course, Ms. Kirschenbaum doesn't simply *tell* these fascinating tidbits; she shows examples of ancient writing and uses various colors and fonts to illuminate her own commentary.  <br /> <br />Gutenberg's printing press changed everything. While movable type led to increased knowledge because book production became cost-effective, it also led to the decline of beauty in books. Except for children's books, cookbooks, and coffee table books, most books today consist of rectangles of black type on white pages. That form is so prevalent that it thrives unquestioned. Ms. Kirschenbaum points out, however, that technology has advanced to the point that color is accessible to us -- even for the *words* in novels, histories, biographies, and other non-fiction books. While this idea may seem alien to us, Ms. Kirschenbaum reports that Faulkner lamented the fact that _The Sound and the Fury_ could not use various colors of type to help readers wend their way through various streams of consciousness. <br /> <br />Another result of Gutenberg's press was the translation of literature into the vernacular: English, French, Spanish, and other \\"languages of the people\\" replaced Latin. Today's vernacular, Ms. Kirschenbaum contends, is color. Everything around us is color -- the world itself, television, movies, advertising. What besides reading matter tries to capture our attention in black and white? Not only is black ink on a white page monotonous, Ms. Kirschenbaum cites neuroscientists' findings that color and design activate areas of the brain that are shut down when a person reads in black and white. <br /> <br />Ms. Kirschenbaum has applied her theories with high school students in the Bronx. She found that when she colored and otherwise \\"designed\\" their literature assignments, students were more engaged; comprehension improved; discussion increased. <br /> <br />_Goodbye Gutenberg_ is extensively researched. Ms. Kirschenbaum confesses that her fourteen-page bibliography, conveniently divided into twenty-three categories, does not include all of her 1,000 sources. In addition to presenting the history of print from around the world, she garners support for her proposed renaissance from many disciplines, including education, psychology, neuroscience, literature and writing, art history, and graphic design. <br /> <br />_Goodbye Gutenberg_ is the ultimate example of \\"designer writing,\\" the ultimate marriage of form and content. The medium is the message. The fact that Ms. Kirschenbaum, a high school English and social studies teacher, designed the whole book (requiring 300 *gigabytes* of storage space) on her home computer (with four gigabytes of RAM) substantiates her claim that such designer writing is both accessible and affordable to the general public.   <br /> <br />Ms. Kirschenbaum designed her own font for her writing (Edgar Allan Poe also believed that writers should design their fonts and their layouts). \\"Booklady\\" is indeed a very readable font. I am amazed at how effortlessly and enjoyably I assimilated the information Ms. Kirschenbaum presents in _Goodbye Gutenberg_. Probably that is because the book was designed by the writer. The information, the organization, the illustrations, the voice, the font, the color -- all blend seamlessly to communicate her message. And that message is that all writing should be so accessible.	2005-01-31

Since he was a boy, Grandpa Dan has planted flowers. He has worked the same flower beds with his son Dan for decades. Now Grandson Danny is also a gardener. <br /> <br />Although Grandpa Dan has taught his son that life is full of change, Grandson Danny resists change -- especially the change that leaves his grandpa forgetful, confused, and eventually unable to perform everyday tasks. <br /> <br />_Flowers for Grandpa Dan_ is indeed a \\"gentle story.\\" Without extraneous elements or didactics, it shows a family coping with Alzheimer's disease, nurturing the essence of their loved one that enables them to connect with him and preserve his legacy. <br /> <br />Louise McIntyre's delicate watercolor illustrations and the book's life-affirming apple green accent color perfectly complement the story. The illustrations depict flowers, not people, retelling the story through metaphor and making it easier for readers to identify with the characters.  <br /> <br />Whether children are full of questions or reluctant to acknowledge changes in their loved ones, _Flowers for Grandpa Dan_ invites discussion about Alzheimer's disease. An informational section provided by the Alzheimer's Association, St. Louis Chapter, outlines the wide array of emotions that children might experience as they see changes in a loved one. These emotions may manifest themselves in many different ways. The informational section suggests ways to answer children's questions about the changes and the disease, and ways that children can maintain a meaningful relationship with their loved one. <br /> <br />A portion of the proceeds from the sale of Flowers for Grandpa Dan will be donated to the Alzheimer's Association.	2005-01-30

After an overview of the test and instructions about how to use the book, Author Laurie Rozakis, Ph.D., offers a diagnostic verbal test so that students can identify their strengths and weaknesses, and determine how their preparation time can most effectively be spent. The diagnostic test includes time limits, an essay prompt, and a cut-out answer sheet for the multiple-choice questions. The answer key includes detailed explanations as to *why* an answer is right or wrong. <br /> <br />After the diagnostic test, Rozakis provides strategies for approaching each type of test question. Sample questions provide opportunity for practice, and answers are thoroughly explained. Rozakis's strategies for the essay address organization as well as the critical issue of time management.  <br /> <br />Ample white space makes the book user-friendly, and typographical devices make the different kinds of information easy to find.  <br /> <br />Rozakis offers about ten pages of content review (sentences, modifiers, pronouns, etc.) for the writing component of the test. While this may be helpful to those basically familiar with the information, many students will require more than this cursory brushup.  <br /> <br />Two additional practice tests (complete with cut-out answer sheet and fully explained answers) round out the book. An index enables users to quickly find desired information.	2004-09-14

(I'm grateful that she acknowledges that always tucking commas and periods inside closing quotation marks is an American convention. Even so, having an abundance of examples to the contrary in an authoritative volume such as this will almost certainly increase the threat to a sorely endangered punctuation rule.) <br /> <br />Truss recognizes punctuation marks -- beginning with the overburdened apostrophe -- as living entities. They were created centuries ago by printers, and their roles are constantly evolving. <br /> <br />Truss explains correct (and incorrect) uses of punctuation marks, even venturing into \\"murky\\" areas and interpreting differences of meaning that occur with the addition of an optional comma. _Eats, Shoots & Leaves_ is not primarily a punctuation handbook, however. <br /> <br />In addition to Truss's wit, one of the things I like best about her book is the history it includes: the origin of punctuation marks, excerpts from famous writers' essays on punctuation, illustrations of punctuation use from literature of previous centuries. Truss includes an extensive bibliography for readers who want to venture further into the realm of punctuation. <br /> <br />As Lynne Truss says, \\"If there is one lesson to be learned from this book, it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation.\\" And that is a lesson that most of the world can well stand to learn.	2004-09-14

The subtitle is perfectly apt: Wit and wisdom form the crux of an oxymoron, and Grothe's examples -- drawn from around the world -- span millennia. <br /> <br />As Grothe says in his introduction, \\"Many examples of oxymoronica appear illogical or self-contradictory on the surface. But at a deeper level, they usually make a great deal of sense and are often profoundly true.\\" <br /> <br />A linguaphile extraordinaire, Grothe has been collecting quotations for nearly four decades. From his eight to ten thousand examples of oxymoronica, he has culled nearly 1500 for inclusion in the present volume. He has arranged them into fourteen chapters, each with a theme, such as romance, family, politics, the arts, and literature. One chapter is devoted to \\"ancient oxymoronica,\\" another to \\"inadvertent oxymoronica.\\" Grothe provides commentary through about the first half of each chapter, citing oxymora (the purists' plural) that illustrate his points. The last half of each chapter presents additional oxymora without commentary. Grothe advises readers not to read these too quickly but to take time to savor each one as if it were gourmet chocolate. <br /> <br />Here are a few of my favorites from _Oxymoronica_: <br /> <br />There is no exception to the rule that every rule has an exception. --James Thurber <br /> <br />Nothing fixes a thing so intensely in the memory as the wish to forget it. --Montaigne <br /> <br />Courage is almost a contradiction in terms. It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die. --G. K. Chesterton <br /> <br />I'm the Hiroshima of love. --Sylvester Stallone  <br /> <br />_Oxymoronica_ is a linguaphile's paradise. It will delight you again and again with its double-faceted gems. It is a celebration not only of people's wit and wisdom but also of the paradoxical nature of our world.	2004-08-28

Lost Treasures from the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair	Books	5	22	22	N	N	Celebrating a Centennial	For decades Diane Rademacher has diligently sought remnants from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. She has traveled thousands of miles and interviewed hundreds of people. Rademacher sought not the collectible souvenirs from the Fair but rather relics from the Fair itself -- the buildings (or parts of buildings), the sculpture, the exhibits. <br />Now she shares her findings in _Still Shining: Discovering Lost Treasures from the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair_. This volume is much more than a where-they-are-now report, however. Rademacher's introduction provides excellent background information on the Fair. In addition, she tells not only where remnants are today but also how they got there. In some cases this history even precedes an item's exhibition at the Fair. <br />The Louisiana Purchase Exposition generated a lot of salvage. The Chicago House Wrecking Company, which was awarded the contract for the Fair's demolition, published a catalog in which a number of items were offered for sale: \\"one hundred million linear feet of lumber, 'enough to build outright over ten (10) cities with a population each of 5,000 inhabitants,' new steel roofing, doors, windows, sills, pipe with fittings, stoves, office equipment, and construction materials of all types. . . . Three hundred and fifty thousand incandescent lamps were offered at 16 cents if new and 6 cents if used.\\"<br />Rademacher's focus, however, is on unique items: the 56-foot statue of Vulcan that stands atop Red Mountain overlooking Birmingham, Alabama; the world's largest pipe organ (now several times larger than it was at the Fair) in the Lord & Taylor department store in downtown Philadelphia; the Connecticut pavilion that is now a stately residence in Lafayette, Indiana. In all, Rademacher cites about sixty treasures in fifteen states plus the District of Columbia.<br />_Still Shining_ is enhanced by nearly 250 photos -- past and present, interior and exterior, panoramic and detailed. These bring the treasures to life for the reader. In addition to listing the discussed items by state, Rademacher includes an index and an extensive bibliography. Thus it is easy to find desired information.  <br />_Still Shining_ is an excellent volume to help you celebrate the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. It is likely to inspire you to look for connections to the Fair in your own community.	2004-01-16

Anyone who cares about the future of America should read this book. Author Diane Ravitch is a historian of education. She first encountered &quot;bias and sensitivity review&quot; panels when she served on the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) beginning in 1998.<br />Ravitch represents neither the left nor the right. Recognizing that both factions agree that children will be shaped by what they read, she provides an objective -- yet impassioned -- viewpoint. She poses tough questions that society must address if we are to preserve our heritage.<br />Ravitch focuses her attention on textbooks and standardized reading tests. In looking first at the tests, Ravitch includes summaries of reading selections that failed to meet the criteria of the bias and sensitivity review panel. One such story involved a blind man who hiked to the top of Mount McKinley. This selection was deemed inappropriate, first of all, because it would be biased against students who had not experienced hiking in the mountains (in fact, any story with a specific geographic location is considered to have a regional bias). In addition, the story was seen as demeaning blind people. Celebrating the feat of the blind man implied that blindness is a handicap.<br />Not only must the subject matter of tests be within students' experience, it must also avoid stereotypes and topics that might distract or upset students (such as illness, death, or divorce). Furthermore, the tests cannot rely on outside knowledge. They have become, then, tests of ability rather than tests of achievement. Ravitch suggests that more attention is given to the inoffensiveness of test items than to their academic soundness. <br />Ravitch cites three types of fairness that govern educational materials in the United States. Ethnic and gender groups must be equitably represented in authorship as well as in content. In addition, gender/ethnic/age stereotypes must be avoided along with specific words, such as those containing &quot;man.&quot; On one hand, we can't present things that are outside students' experience; on the other, we can't portray minority groups in typical situations. As Ravitch points out, &quot;mothering&quot; can't be shown at all: It is outside the realm of experience for males; it is stereotypical for females. <br />Most things written before 1970 fail to meet ethnic and gender guidelines. Classics, therefore, are generally omitted from textbooks that anthologize literature. Sometimes works of literature are bowdlerized, with or without the author's consent. Characters may be changed to provide the requisite gender and ethnic mix without so much as a footnote acknowledging a change from the original.<br />History textbooks provide a unique challenge. In order to survive, major publishers have had to acquiesce to the content demands of powerful state textbook adoption committees. They have added multicultural heroes and have eliminated controversy. Ravitch asserts that the books have become very difficult to read. Splendid graphics and sidebars distract the reader from the text, which has been reduced to pablum.<br />In addition to reviewing a number of history textbooks and reporting on state history guidelines, Ravitch includes two thirty-page appendices: a glossary of &quot;banned words, usages, stereotypes, and topics,&quot; and a recommended list of classical literature for grades three through ten.<br />Not only does Ravitch offer a thorough description of censorship of educational materials, she details a three-point solution, beginning with the elimination of massive state adoptions that determine, to a large extent, the books' content.<br />We might expect censorship to be signaled by protests and outcries. What is at work in the world of textbook publishing is more insidious, however. It is a silent censorship, because the compliance of publishers has been voluntary. <br />Problems created by censorship of educational materials extend well beyond our schools, which have traditionally played a major role in molding the next generation of citizens. We run a serious risk of creating citizens who not only lack basic facts about our country and our world but also lack the critical-thinking skills to evaluate controversial information effectively.	2003-10-07

Its title, colorful cover, and interior design are reminiscent of children's books. While many of the games can be used in classrooms, the primary audience for the book is adults -- people who want to improve the creativity of those in their businesses or other organizations.<br />The forty-eight games in the book are based on Epstein's Generativity Theory. His ideas about the creative process grew out of his laboratory research. In addition to refuting popular myths about the creative process, Epstein identifies four core competencies that help individuals express their creativity (plus four more competencies to nurture creativity in others):<br />1. Capturing new ideas<br />2. Challenging yourself so that new ideas emerge<br />3. Broadening your base of knowledge and experience<br />4. Surrounding yourself with an environment -- both physical and social -- that encourages new ideas<br />Despite the fact that the book is grounded in theory and research, the information it contains is practical and easily accessible. The book is written in lay terms, and the information is as easy to understand as the juvenile format leads you to expect it to be.<br />The games are categorized by purpose (such as &quot;convincing people that they're creative&quot;) and by core competency. It is easy, therefore, to find games to fit a particular need. Epstein devotes about three pages to each game, providing a summary of the game, its objective, the time required (ranging from 5 to 90 minutes), the materials needed (generally readily available), the procedure, and discussion questions. The discussion questions are indeed a key feature of the book, for the games are intended not only to boost creativity but also to demonstrate creativity's basic principles.<br />Epstein places a high premium on failure. He says that failure causes us to recall past methods of dealing with a problem -- and often discover a new solution. Without failure, creativity is not needed (remember the Apollo 13 mission). Many games involving the second competency, Challenging, deal with managing the frustration and other negative emotions that often accompany failure.<br />In addition, the book includes an abridged version of Epstein's Creativity Competencies Inventory for Individuals (ECCI-i) along with a self-scorer. These tools are effective for evaluating a person's overall creativity and each of the four competencies. It is easy, then, for a person to see which areas would benefit from development.says that failure causes us to recall past methods of dealing with a problem -- and often discover a new solution.

In _The Miracle of Language_ he writes somewhat more seriously about this language that he loves, inspiring in us a deeper appreciation of our system of communication that we often take for granted.<br />The chapter titled &quot;In Praise of English&quot; makes us grateful that ours is a language that puts so many words at our disposal -- remarkable for their sheer number as well as for their variety. Because English has so freely adopted words from other languages, we often have many choices about how we will express an idea -- whether we will use short words derived from Anglo-Saxon, for example, or more luxurious words derived from French.<br />Although Lederer's subject matter is serious, his style never becomes ponderous. His short chapters and lively prose keep the reader engaged. And occasionally he cannot resist playing, as in the chapter titled &quot;The Case for Short Words,&quot; where for four paragraphs he restricts himself to one-syllable words.<br />Of special interest are the chapters about literary giants -- William Shakespeare, Samuel Johnson, Lewis Carroll, Mark Twain, Emily Dickinson, T. S. Eliot, and George Orwell -- and the contributions they have made not only to our literature but also to our language. For example, Shakespeare is credited with the first use of over 1,700 words, nearly eight percent of the different words that he used in his writing. In addition, his plays include many phrases that have become titles of novels and many others that have been repeated so often that they have become clichés.  <br />Lederer also includes many inspiring quotations about English and entries from the ground-breaking dictionaries of Samuel Johnson and Ambrose Bierce. (Can you imagine undertaking the formidable task of writing the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language?)<br />Lederer champions letter writing, poetry writing, libraries, reading, the effective use of English. Particularly poignant is the example of mistranslation of one word that led to the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />Lederer fondly portrays English as a thriving, evolving entity. By instilling appreciation for the legacy we have received, he inspires us to safeguard its future.	2003-09-07

Although it is not aimed at a juvenile audience, it is likely to be helpful to teachers and parents who are nurturing storytelling in children -- particularly if they want to use reading aloud as a springboard to storytelling. Roney devotes nearly half of the book to reading aloud effectively. Most chapters include sections on story selection, preparation, and delivery. Practice activities and resources are also included. Only one chapter (about twenty pages) focuses directly on the storytelling craft.	2003-09-07

Authors Irene C. Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell have created a comprehensive manual for establishing a reading/writing community -- a place where students can spend two and a half to three hours a day engaged in authentic reading and writing.<br />Teachers who are already using a workshop approach are likely to find much in _Guiding Readers and Writers_ that will make their job easier. Even teachers of younger and older students will find many practical suggestions to implement.<br />Fountas and Pinnell see the goal of language arts instruction in the intermediate grades to be the creation of lifelong readers and writers. They structure the language arts class in a three-block framework: a sixty-minute reading workshop, a sixty-minute writing workshop, and a thirty- to sixty-minute language/word study segment (including spelling, vocabulary, decoding, and more).<br />In addition to providing a treasure trove of information, Fountas and Pinnell have produced a book that is remarkably readable and user-friendly. The two-column format is extremely helpful. In addition, frequent headings, bullet points, and graphics help you to efficiently get the information you need.<br />With photos and other graphics, Fountas and Pinnell show you how to organize your classroom, your materials, and your time for a reading/writing workshop. The authors provide step-by-step instructions for getting started (in a few instances even offering a sample script). They provide scores of suggestions for minilessons, and they recommend more than 1,000 books for classroom use. In addition, each section includes techniques to use with struggling readers and writers. The book even devotes a section to the \\"testing genre,\\" helping students develop strategies to maximize their performance on standardized reading tests.<br />Furthermore, _Guiding Readers and Writers_ includes sixty-five appendices (nearly 150 pages)! Fifty-three of the appendices are reproducible pages that the teacher or the student can use for planning, record-keeping, assessment, analysis, etc. Most of the remaining appendices comprise lists of recommended books. A list of 1,000 books is repeated -- organized once by title and again by level.  <br />_Guiding Readers and Writers_ will help you rekindle the passions that originally prompted you to become an English teacher -- and it will show you how to share those passions with your students. Focusing on the vital elements of communication is likely to produce the best year ever -- for you *and* for your students.	2003-05-22

Greta's older brother had been a promising concert pianist, but now that he has died, her mother is threatening to sell their piano.<br />Early in the novel Greta tells why the piano is so important to her: \\"I [played the piano] because it satisfied something inside me, the way a bowl of hot soup satisfied my stomach or a breath of fresh air satisfied my lungs. But the something it satisfied was deeper than my stomach or my lungs. It was the part of me that made me *me*.\\"<br />Without preaching, _Play to the Angel_ provides a powerful example of a resolute heroine pursuing a dream in the face of obstacles -- in the closing chapters, the Nazi occupation. Greta receives lessons that are valuable to any performer: On nervousness: \\". . . you must give the music in you a chance to chase away the fear instead of letting the fear chase away the music.\\" Similarly, Greta is taught about two kinds of musicians -- one, which uses music to present his skill to the world, and the other, which uses his skill to present the music.<br />Maurine Dahlberg's first novel, _Play to the Angel_ has been nominated for the Mark Twain Award for 2002-2003.	2003-01-15

The book's principal author, Lucy Calkins, is a teacher educator, yet she considers the teaching of her two young sons to be her most important work. Calkins relates many vivid examples from her own experience.<br />Although Calkins discusses things parents can do to maximize school success, _Raising Lifelong Learners_ is not a book about helping children with their homework. Instead it tells how to make the home a rich learning environment, how to arouse children's curiosity in all academic areas. Calkins says, \\" . . . the qualities that matter most in science and math, reading and writing -- initiative, thoughtfulness, curiosity, resourcefulness, perseverance, and imagination -- are best nurtured through the everydayness of our shared lives at home.\\"<BR> <BR>Calkins believes in leading children very gradually along the path of learning in all academic areas. She says, \\"My rule of thumb is to help the child do today what she will be able to do tomorrow. I don't want my assistance to be too far beyond the child's independent abilities or she will be put in a dependent position, always waiting for and wanting assistance.\\"<br />Calkins places heavy emphasis on both work and play. The latter provides an opportunity for children to develop imagination, resourcefulness, and language skills. Calkins believes that parents, not schools, have the primary responsibility for developing a work ethic in children. This is cultivated through hobbies and projects as well as through chores.  <br />After Calkins discusses the nurturing of language arts, math, science, and social studies as children progress from infancy through middle school, Lydia Bellino, a reading specialist and school principal, addresses school issues in half a dozen appendices. Most of these, such as curricular choices and various assessment methods, can also apply to thehomeschool situation.	2003-01-15

It can also be used effectively by younger and older students, however. Dr. Levine makes information accessible to young people by presenting it in small chunks with frequent headings. His style is conversational, and he uses familiar metaphors to explain physiological concepts. Attention, for example, is described in terms of channel selection and filtration.<br />Levine heartens his readers -- not only by demonstrating a clear understanding of their difficulties but also by providing hope for the success that everyone needs. While he recognizes that people succeed in different areas -- academics, athletics, and art, to name just a few -- he acknowledges that during the school-age years, lack of success in the academic area can have far-reaching<br />consequences.<br />After explaining how the brain functions normally to help a person focus attention, use language, and employ memory, Levine discusses various problems that might arise in these areas. He then relates performance in reading, spelling, writing, and math to those disorders. Levine even addresses social skills, recognizing that school has a very strong social component.<br />Levine celebrates the many strengths that people with learning disorders might have. He encourages them to appreciate and bolster their strengths even as they are attempting to understand and bypass their weaknesses. He empowers students to advocate on their own behalf, and he reassures them that they are likely to be more successful in life after school -- when they are free to work in their preferred area rather than in one assigned to them by someone else.<br />_Keeping A Head in School_ is most effective if readers with learning disorders have the opportunity to discuss concepts presented with parents, teachers, and/or other adults.<br /><br />The book can also provide valuable insight for those who interact with people who have learning disorders: siblings, friends, parents, teachers, and others.

Each section includes a comprehensive discussion of the theme, enhanced by sidebars and colorful visuals. Sections range in length from two to twenty pages, making the chunks of information small enough to be palatable yet large enough to be satisfying.<br />Topics addressed include language and thought, the structure of language, the anatomy and physiology of speech, written language, language acquisition, languages of the world, language disabilities, and language change. Obviously, this is only a sample. In addition, the book has eight appendices, including an extensive glossary and a table giving information about nearly 1,000 of the world's languages.<br /><br />While many of Crystal's topics have their technical aspects, the author keeps his tone conversational and his information accessible to the lay reader.

The story is told through the diary of Minerva Swift, youngest of four sisters and the second-youngest child in her family. If you can suspend your disbelief that an eleven-year-old would write an average of five pages of flawless prose every day between Thanksgiving and Christmas, you are in for a treat.<br />The Swifts live in Indianapolis in 1932. Although they are struggling less than most families (some of whom we glimpse both in the Swifts' neighborhood and in the shantytowns), they do have to adjust their lifestyle -- their menus, their purchases, their activities. As Minnie astutely observes, \\"I think that there has never been such a collision between realness and fantasy. It is as if we are standing with our feet in the muck and grime of these hard times but our noses are pressed up against the window of some fantastically glamorous world.\\" <br />Indeed, the juxtaposition of reality and fantasy pervades the book. People gather around the radio to listen to Jack Benny, Buck Rogers, or The Shadow; they go to the movies that provide an inexpensive, though temporary, escape from their troubles. They look for some magic to change the conditions of their existence. Willie Faye, an orphaned cousin who comes from the Dust Bowl of Texas to live with the Swifts, looks to faith rather than to magic for the change. (Despite this -- and the fact that the book deals with the month leading up to Christmas -- _Christmas After All_ is not a religious book. It should be appropriate for use in a public school classroom.)<br />In _Christmas After All_ we see a family showing optimism in the face of hardship, humor in the face of fear. Family members must determine when frivolities become necessities -- and they show great resourcefulness in making gifts and fashioning new clothes. _Christmas After All_ gives a vivid picture of life during the Great Depression, and it holds lessons for all of us -- especially during our challenging economic times.	2002-12-04

Instead he focuses his energy on its resurrection. <br />Dowis's background in journalism and public relations provided the foundation for his writing a remarkably readable book. His conversational style serves as a model for the language you would want to hear -- and use -- in a speech. Frequent headings and an especially legible font also contribute to the book's readability.<br />In _The Lost Art of the Great Speech_, Dowis addresses every conceivable aspect of this topic -- from deciding whether to accept a speaking engagement to \\"leveraging\\" a speech by converting it to one or more publishable articles. The book takes a holistic approach to speech writing. Chapters follow the process of speech preparation, including delivery as well as crafting. In addition, Dowis discusses topics such as how to write a speech to be delivered by someone else and how to introduce a speaker.<br />Each chapter includes pertinent excerpts from actual speeches, many taken from the business world, and also includes a full speech or a substantial excerpt of a speech by a well-known person. Many of these speeches have historical significance. Having asserted that \\"reading and listening to speeches is one of the keys to learning how to write and deliver them,\\" Dowis supplies us with many examples to study.<br />Dowis devotes several chapters to rhetorical devices that can lift a speech from the respectable to the eloquent. To illustrate how rhetoric can immortalize a concept, he compares several versions of an idea that appeared in speeches by famous Americans.<br />In addition to a detailed index, _The Lost Art of the Great Speech_ includes two helpful appendices: An Editing Checklist for Speech Writers and Resources for Speakers and Speech Writers.<br />_The Lost Art of the Great Speech_ is a valuable resource for anyone who might have the opportunity to address a group of people. Although it does not include study questions or practice exercises, it would be an excellent book for a class of high school or college students as well as for adults who are studying independently.	2002-10-02

Not only is _A Mind at a Time_ a bestseller, Levine has recently been featured on several national talk shows and on the ... documentary _Misunderstood Minds_.<br />_A Mind at a Time_ is easy for the lay person to read and understand. Although Levine closely follows educational research, he does not cite research studies in _A Mind at a Time_. Rather he bases the book on \\"objective clinical observation.\\" Levine writes, \\"For me these kids have been like textbooks on learning and mind development. I can learn more about a child by getting to know her well than by reading a list of computer-generated test scores. In fact, whenever I participate in the clinical evaluation of a child, I see some facets of brain function that I have never before seen.\\"<br />A genuine appreciation of each child shines through each of the case vignettes that Levine includes in _A Mind at a Time_. This appreciation is not merely compassion for a child dealing with learning difficulties; it is a celebration of the unique combination of strengths and weaknesses that makes up each child's mind. Optimism also pervades the discussion of each child.<br />Levine identifies eight \\"neurodevelopmental systems\\" that work together during learning. The relationship between these systems is similar to that between the body's physiological systems (such as the circulatory system and the respiratory system). These eight systems are<br /> attention control <BR> memory<BR> language<BR> spatial ordering<BR> sequential ordering<BR> motor<BR> higher thinking (including problem solving, logical reasoning, critical thinking, creative thinking, and more)<BR> social thinking<br />Levine examines each of these systems in detail and includes \\"practical considerations\\" for helping children function well in each area. He says that many dysfunctions in these areas cannot be identified on any test.<br />Levine points out that people are expected to do well at everything only when they are children. Once they are out of school, they can select a career that is a good match to their neurodevelopmental strengths.<br />Levine believes that before addressing difficulties with learning it is important to examine \\"how learning works when it's working.\\" This leads to an upward spiral for success as remedies for learning problems can be applied to improve learning strategies for all students. <br />Levine concludes _A Mind at a Time_ with chapters about the roles of the home and the school in learning. He also provides an index and an annotated list of \\"Helpful Readings and Other Resources.\\"	2002-06-07

That Bernard Goldberg did so is remarkable.<br />Goldberg -- himself a liberal with nearly thirty years of experience at CBS News -- had often voiced his concern about liberal bias to network executives. After _CBS Evening News_ aired a blatantly slanted \\"Reality Check\\" report on February 8, 1996, Goldberg decided to take stronger measures. He submitted to the _Wall Street Journal_ an op-ed piece detailing the report's bias. The piece was published five days later.<br />_Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News_ analyzes the bias that has developed in the news over the past several decades. In addition, the book reveals the personality of some media celebrities and executives. It seems impossible to completely extricate \\"the news\\" from the people who report it.<br />Goldberg traces the problem of bias in the news back to _60 Minutes_, the pioneer of news magazines. In the early days of television, the networks viewed comedy, drama, and variety shows as their moneymakers. The news, however, was different. Once network executives discovered that even the news could be profitable, news programs began competing for ratings. Rather than simply reporting the news objectively, networks tried to ensure that the news would have entertainment value, that people would like what they saw and would tune in regularly.<br />As Goldberg points out, many journalists selected that career in order to improve the world. Eventually, however, their compassion began to interfere with their objective reporting. They took on the work of activists. In order to motivate people to support causes -- perhaps financially -- they made the people who would benefit from that support look like the prospective donors. Thus, homelessness and AIDS were portrayed as problems of mainstream America. Facts were distorted; numbers were exaggerated.<br />The ratings and the causes are only part of the problem, however. Goldberg is most alarmed that reporters and executives are not even aware of much of the bias in the news. No one at CBS News, for example, had seen any problem with the report that had sparked Goldberg's initial op-ed piece for the _Wall Street Journal_ -- even though a reporter had in the guise of a \\"Reality Check\\" ridiculed Presidential candidate Steve Forbes and his flat-tax proposal, using such words as \\"scheme,\\" \\"elixir,\\" and \\"wacky.\\" <br />In network newsrooms the middle of the road between liberals and conservatives is off center. Virtually everyone in the newsroom is a liberal. People are so insulated that they don't even know anyone whose opinions are different from theirs; they genuinely believe they represent the middle of the road. Goldberg cites the example of film critic Pauline Kael, who was astounded when Nixon was elected President in 1972. \\"I don't know a single person who voted for him!\\" she said. Yet Nixon carried forty-nine states. Is it healthy for those who report our news to be so out of touch with the populace?<br />Freedom of speech and of the press are among the highest ideals in our democracy. Even Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, valued newspapers (the principal news medium of his day) above government. If we are to be responsible citizens, we must be able to gauge the accuracy of news reports. _Bias_ provides information that will help us to raise necessary questions about the news -- what is reported and what is not -- in order to discern the truth.	2002-06-07

Fair, Ph.D., present examples of many kinds of personal messages, including<BR>those of appreciation, apology, advice, inspiration, and comfort. The first requirement of a personal message is to write in your &quot;true voice.&quot; Using vivid everyday language contributes sincerity and depth to a message. <br />Morris and Fair identify five basic elements to include in nearly every message, regardless of its purpose: <br />1. What got me thinking about you? <BR>2. What are my positive feelings for you? <BR>3. What makes you special to me? <BR>4. What do I remember and treasure about our time together? <BR>5. What do I want you to get from my message? <br />These elements, which need not be in any particular sequence, are unobtrusively identified in the many messages that serve as models in *From Me to You*. The authors also add several special elements and techniques that are helpful for especially difficult messages. One of the most interesting of these is Writing in the Margins, creating a separate column on your page in which you write your inner thoughts and feelings that might detract from your message's purpose. <br />Morris and Fair do not limit their messages to print -- or even to words. They discuss audio and videotape messages, collections of music, annotating children's creations, passing along stories with family recipes. There is no end to the number of ways to create lasting messages for the special people in your life. <br />Many of us are in the sad situation of having questions about our family members but having no living person who can answer them. Providing your loved ones with messages that communicate your feelings and your family stories will reduce the likelihood that this will happen to them. <br />As you celebrate special occasions, why not give powerful, personal messages to those you love? Such messages are lasting<BR>gifts; they can be read again and again, and they might be read by a descendant even a century later. <br />*From Me to You* will make it easier for you to initiate communication that will connect you more deeply with those around<BR>you. The example messages will show you how, and the accompanying stories of their success will contribute inspiration.	2001-11-07

Senn shares one of her lifelong passions. That this is a true passion of hers becomes immediately apparent as you read both her ideas about journaling and excerpts from her own journals.<br />Senn identifies two major advantages of journal writing: enhancing the present by making us more attuned to the world around us and preserving our observations both for ourselves and for future generations. <br />After providing a historical perspective on journal writing, Senn describes ten distinct kinds of journaling: Some focus on introspection; some inspire our creativity; some encourage observation of nature; some invite our unique perspective on historical events; some lead to rich resources for family genealogists; and some simply remind us of the joy and humor around us.   <br />Best of all, perhaps, Senn relieves decades of guilt for those of us who have felt that we &quot;should&quot; be keeping journals: &quot;. . . that which is viewed as a burden seldom becomes a joy. Write what you want, when you want to. Approach journaling with love and humor, and leave the guilt-trips and 'shoulds' behind.&quot;<br />Senn makes a compelling case for journaling. She clearly presents its benefits, and while she says there is no wrong way to journal, her many suggestions virtually guarantee success. The journal entries themselves -- her own and those of others -- comprise the most powerful testimony. They are the tangible evidence that will endure for generations. Those who keep journals will have this treasure; those who don't keep them will lack it.<br />In addition to being a helpful guide for any individual who wants to journal, THE MANY FACES OF JOURNALING: TOPICS &amp; TECHNIQUES FOR PERSONAL JOURNAL WRITING would be appropriate for high school, college, or adult journaling classes.	2001-05-02

In this small volume she provides step-by-step concrete suggestions for engaging children in open-ended discussions about questions that do not have right answers. Such conversations can help children become better thinkers, better communicators, and better problem solvers. The techniques that Dr. Healy delineates can be used at home, at school, when traveling, anywhere that a conversation can occur.<br />Dr. Healy suggests that adults begin by setting aside time for creative conversations with children and by making sure that all participants know the ground rules. She suggests many ways adults can model creative thinking as well as ways they can encourage children to express themselves. She offers specific ways to acknowledge a statement, restate it, clarify it, disagree with it, redirect it, and expand it.<br />About half the book comprises what Healy calls &quot;playful ponderings&quot; -- examples of the open-ended questions that can serve as the catalyst for conversations. She divides these into three levels:<br />Mind-Openers (for primary-aged children; dealing with concrete objects and experiences). Example: How can you tell that someone is your friend? What do you need to do to be a friend?<br />Mind-Stretchers (for third graders through adolescents). Example: Design the perfect house pet. What would you name it?<br />Mind-Bogglers (for mature middle schoolers, teens, and adults; requiring abstract reasoning skills). Example: Why do you suppose people sing?<br />Many questions are followed by conversation hints and follow-up questions.

Nolan's sentence was to have his wish fulfilled. For fifty-five years he was kept at sea, being repeatedly transferred from ships that approached land to those that were headed out to sea. Although Nolan was not treated like a prisoner, a unique protocol was developed that kept him from hearing or seeing any news from home.<br />Because of obscure references (especially early in the story) and some archaic wording, reading the story aloud is recommended. This provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that much can be gleaned from a story even when references are not completely understood. Pausing periodically to summarize the main points can help to keep students involved until you get to Hale's anecdotes that will truly captivate them.<br />In addition to delineating the consequences of an impetuous act, &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; provides a thought-provoking portrait of a patriot. In essays or debates students might consider Was Nolan's sentence fair? Should he have been pardoned?	2001-04-04

It was the source of two musical plays, INNER CITY, which opened on Broadway in 1971, and STREET DREAMS, which opened in 1982, the same year a new edition of the book was released. A third edition, with an introduction by poet Nikki Giovanni, was published in 1996.<br />Like the original Mother Goose rhymes, THE INNER CITY MOTHER GOOSE delivers social and political commentary. It is less subtle than Mother Goose rhymes, however. It will take many readers outside their own neighborhoods -- and their own comfort zones -- as it vividly depicts the brutal reality of life in contemporary urban areas: the poverty, the violence, the oppression, the filth, the corruption, the desperation. Still, readers are likely to recognize that they share many dreams with the INNER CITY characters: for love, fairness, education, a decent home, gainful employment.<br />Many of the rhymes echo the words and/or the rhythm of familiar Mother Goose rhymes, creating the illusion of playfulness and innocence. Often the last line of a poem takes an unexpected twist that ambushes the reader as if he or she were being mugged on a dark street. <br />Eve Merriam said, &quot;I have been told that THE INNER CITY MOTHER GOOSE was at one time the second most banned book in the country. I didn't write it for children. It was never intended to be a children's book. But it has percolated down, certainly to high school and junior high.&quot;<br />THE INNER CITY MOTHER GOOSE offers much food for thought and discussion -- from the forms it mimics to the social situations it portrays. Teen and pre-teen readers might need guidance to distinguish between a lifestyle described and a lifestyle endorsed.	2001-04-04

HOW TO WRITE POETRY is the book I hope I would have written on this subject.<br />First of all, the small format and conversational style invite the reader in. Janeczko begins by suggesting ways for writers to catalog their words and ideas. In addition to notebooks, he recommends the use of a tape recorder when writing notes is not practical. Janeczko also emphasizes the importance of reading. Throughout the book he provides bibliographic lists that provide more information on concepts in each chapter. Yet another list of good poetry anthologies is included at the end of the book.<br />After a sketch of the writing process, Janeczko describes several specific kinds of poems: acrostic poems, synonym poems, opposite poems, clerihews, list poems, poems of address, persona poems, and narrative poems. Elements especially important in poetry (sound, images, word choice, figurative language, and line breaks) are discussed in a recurring &quot;Poetcraft&quot; feature. Poems by students and by famous poets amply illustrate both the poetic elements and  the particular formats. Biographical notes on all poets are included near the end of the book.<br />Other special recurring features of HOW TO WRITE POETRY include &quot;Writing Tip from a Poet,&quot; &quot;Try This&quot; (specific suggestions for writing), and various checklists. In addition to the biographical and bibliographical information mentioned earlier, the book includes an index and a comprehensive, cross-referenced glossary, which even includes examples of various formats.<br />Although Janeczko maintains that poems must be written for oneself, he also suggests many ways to &quot;publish&quot; finished poems -- from handmade books to cards and posters, to submitting to magazines and contests. He recommends MARKET GUIDE FOR YOUNG WRITERS by Kathy Henderson (Writer's DigestBooks, 1996) as an invaluable resource for those interested in submitting for publication.<br />Even beyond the pertinent subjects Janeczko includes, however, is the manner in which he conveys his information. Having taught English and compiled more than a dozen poetry anthologies, Janeczko is a master who projects wholehearted confidence that young poets can and will succeed.	2001-04-04

People whose beliefs are not grounded may be oblivious to almost imperceptible assaults on their value system. THE CHILDREN'S STORY reminds us that &quot;the enemy&quot; may not be hideous or foreign but may be attractive, intelligent, reasonable, gentle, and friendly. <br />THE CHILDREN'S STORY is ideal for reading aloud. Not only can the contrasting tones of the story be conveyed vocally, the reading and discussion of this story (with occasional pauses to ask, &quot;Who likes the New Teacher?&quot;) can be accomplished in approximately the same time required for the events of the story to take place.	2001-04-04

Whether you think Philip Malloy is a smart aleck who got what he deserved or consider him the innocent victim of an authoritarian teacher, you will be spellbound as a classroom incident gradually escalates to a national controversy.<br />Avi calls NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH a &quot;documentary novel.&quot; He offers no commentary. Rather he provides various documents -- memos, transcripts of conversations, diary entries, etc. -- so that readers can draw their own conclusions from primary sources.<br />NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH offers many lessons about life and about literature. Readers can see the far-reaching consequences of casual actions. They can contemplate the enforcement of rules and grapple with the question of responsibility.<br />NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH provides a perfect example of objective writing and a wonderful opportunity to discuss point of view. Readers can then examine the process of inference: Exactly what leads them to the conclusions that they draw?<br />An interesting way to study the novel is to have a class read it aloud with the same students reading the main characters' roles throughout. Reading can be alternated with discussion. You may find it difficult to determine where characters' points of view leave off and students' begin.	2001-04-04

Jonas, an Eleven when THE GIVER opens, lives in a Community where everything is meticulously ordered: houses look alike, people dress alike, each family unit includes a father and a mother (who can apply for one male and one female child). Children begin their volunteer hours when they are Eights, and the Committee of Elders assigns them their roles in the Community at the Ceremony of Twelves. Because the people have chosen Sameness, nothing in their  Community is unexpected, inconvenient, or unusual. They have no hills, no color, no cold, no sunshine. Their feelings are only superficial; their memories encompass only one generation. Pain is relieved instantly by taking a pill. They have abdicated choices.<br />The Receiver of Memory holds the position of highest honor within the Community, serving as the repository for the memories and knowledge of generations. Whenever the Committee of Elders are faced with a new situation, they are able to seek the counsel and  advice of the Receiver. They have the benefit of experience without having to bear its pain.<br />Because of his intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, and Capacity to See Beyond, Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory. The current Receiver, who has held the position for decades, then becomes the Giver. <br />Ms. Lowry paints a vivid picture of this Community. Referring to everyday concepts in a slightly unusual way helps to set that society apart from our own. Babies younger than one year are called &quot;newchildren,&quot; for example; children of the same age are &quot;groupmates&quot;; the elderly, the unhealthy, or those who have broken the rules three times may be &quot;released.&quot;<br />Why might parents or teachers consider THE GIVER inappropriate for their children? I can only speculate on this since I find the book profoundly original and commendable: <br />1. The setting being a community without freedom. It should be noted, however, that citizens relinquished their freedom years earlier in order to escape the accompanying chaos. They are perfectly satisfied with their arrangement and are not oppressed.<br />2. The family being depicted as a temporary sociological unit rather than a permanent socio-biological unit. Nevertheless, this family unit provides a very nurturing atmosphere. <br />3. References to &quot;Stirrings&quot; (sexual arousal). These occur only a few times in the book and are only vaguely described. Since Stirrings are forbidden in the Community, young people begin taking a preventative pill upon first experiencing them and continue taking it daily until they enter the House of the Old.<br />4. The idea of young people bathing the elderly of the opposite gender. This happens only once in the book. It is a gentle, caring, and (given the ages of the participants) asexual experience.<br />5. The concept of &quot;release.&quot; This pervades the book, but its meaning remains uncertain until Chapter 19, when Jonas witnesses a release.<br />I would think that for many readers these concerns would be assuaged by Jonas, the young protagonist who, in the course of his instruction, recognizes the advantages of previous systems and selflessly tries to better his Community. <br />Although there are aspects of this Community that we may find unsettling, we must remember that Lowry is not advocating this system. She is, in fact, inviting us to consider whether our own society has any of the characteristics of the Community that disturb us:<br />Do we attempt to make our lives pain free?<br />Do we attempt to erase unpleasant memories?<br />Do we use euphemisms?<br />Do we use robotic phrases, as for apologies?<br />Do we have anything resembling the &quot;House of the Old&quot;?<br />Do we have a ritual that might be called a &quot;Ceremony of Loss&quot;?<br />Do we attempt Climate Control?<br />Do we avoid talking about ways in which we differ from each other?<br />In our own Society, without a designated Receiver of Memory, that responsibility -- with its inherent pain and exhilaration -- falls to each of us. Vital questions for us to consider are Which memories will we receive? Which will we give?	2001-04-04

AN EXALTATION OF LARKS (Ultimate Edition) is the culmination of more than two decades of Lipton's research of &quot;nouns of multitude,&quot; which he prefers to call &quot;terms of venery.&quot; <br />Many of these terms are commonplace: plague of locusts, pride of lions, litter of pups. Imagine, though, hearing these expressions for the first time. Lipton invites us to &quot;sharpen our senses by restoring the magic to the mundane.&quot; <br />Lipton traced a number of these terms back to the 1400s, specifically to THE BOOK OF ST. ALBANS, printed in 1486. In addition to today's ordinary terms, he discovered some that had a fresh sound, precisely because they had not made the 500-year journey to our modern era.<br />Lipton identifies six sources of inspiration for the terms. He lists these &quot;Families&quot; with the following examples:<br />1. Onomatopoeia: a murmuration of starlings, a gaggle of geese.<br />2. Characteristic (by far the largest Family): a leap of leopards, a skulk of foxes.<br />3. Appearance: a knot of toads, a parliament of owls.<br />4. Habitat: a shoal of bass, a nest of rabbits.<br />5. Comment (pro or con depending on viewpoint): a richness of martens, a cowardice of curs.<br />6. Error (in transcription or printing; sometimes preserved for centuries): &quot;school&quot; of fish was originally intended to be &quot;shoal.&quot;<br />Lipton enthusiastically joined the &quot;game&quot; of coining terms, which had been in progress for more than 500 years. In 1968 he published his first EXALTATION OF LARKS, which contained 175 terms -- some from Middle English, some original. Neither the hardbound nor the paperback edition went out of print before the Ultimate Edition (with more than 1,000 terms) was published in 1991. As Lipton puts it, textbooks and various media &quot;used the book like sourdough to leaven new batches of terms.&quot;<br />Lipton believes that a pun or a play on words detracts from the vigor of a term. Alliteration, likewise, is unnecessary. Rather the success of the term hinges on identifying the &quot;quintessential part&quot; of the group of people or things and allowing it to represent the whole: a blur of impressionists, a brood of hens, a quiver of arrows. (Lipton's research on this last item revealed that as early as 1300 a poetic soul rejected the available words &quot;case&quot; and &quot;scabbard&quot; and turned &quot;quiver&quot; into a noun.)<br />AN EXALTATION OF LARKS includes a few pages detailing Lipton's lexical odysseys and triumphs. Most of the book comprises the lists themselves. The origin of some of the terms is explained, and more than 250 of the terms are illustrated with witty engravings by Grandville, a 19th Century French lithographer. More than half the book lists terms in 25 categories, such as professions (an aroma of bakers), daily life (a belch of smokestacks), and academe (a discord of experts).<br />Lipton includes several versions of games in which players coin new terms. His index lists his 1,000+ terms with a blank replacing the first item, which is the source of a term's poetry. The reader is thus encouraged to discern the essence of the thing collected. The page number facilitates the comparison of newly coined terms with existing ones.<br />AN EXALTATION OF LARKS is indeed &quot;a word lover's garden of delights.&quot;	2001-04-04
US	44498840	R1YAOS7NHEVRDY	015269062X	281270446	Rootabaga Stories, Part Two	Books	5	53	53	N	N	American Fairy Tales	Carl Sandburg, winner of Pulitzer Prizes both for his biography of Abraham Lincoln and for his COMPLETE POEMS, explores another genre in ROOTABAGA STORIES, fairy tales that he wrote for his daughters. When asked how he wrote the stories, Sandburg replied, &quot;The children asked questions, and I answered them.&quot;<br />The ROOTABAGA STORIES are unconventional in almost every way. Unlike traditional fairy tales, they have no perfect princesses and evil witches. They are American fairy tales with a rural flavor and, in fact, they have no evil characters. The settings, though fanciful, include images that defined America in the 1920s, when the stories were published: the railroad, which &quot;ran across the prairie, to the mountains, to the sea,&quot; and the skyscraper.<br />In Rootabaga Country the railroad tracks go from straight to zigzag, the pigs wear bibs (some checked, some striped, some polka-dotted), and the biggest city is the Village of Liver-and-Onions. Characters in this fanciful world are equally peculiar: Please Gimme, Blixie Blimber, Eeta Peeca Pie, and dozens of others. Children and literary critics alike would be hard-pressed to explain (even symbolically) the events that occur in the stories. Nevertheless, meaning comes through and truth is revealed. For example, in &quot;Three Boys with Jugs of Molasses and Secret Ambitions,&quot; ambition is defined as &quot;a little creeper that creeps and creeps in your heart night and day, singing a little song, 'Come and find me, come and find me.'&quot; Who would expect that &quot;The Two Skyscrapers Who Decided to Have a Child&quot; would have an absolutely poignant ending?<br />Although the events of the stories may not be explainable, the stories are replete with concrete images. Sandburg provides both visual and auditory description with musical, repetitious phrases and novel juxtaposition of words (&quot;a daughter who is a dancing shaft of light on the ax handles of morning&quot;). Occasionally he invents words, such as &quot;pfisty-pfoost,&quot; the sound of the train's steam engine, and &quot;bickerjiggers,&quot; the buttons on an accordion.<br />ROOTABAGA STORIES are wonderful for reading aloud. They provide an opportunity for readers and listeners to delight in language and revel in truths revealed in a fanciful world.	2001-04-04
