Books	5	4	6	N	Y	Magificent tale of courage, duty and iron discipline	Outstanding story of the true events on Malta in 1565 in a struggle between the Turks and the small band of Knights of St John. Terrific research, compelling characters and some truly horrific and gruesome battle when most battles were fought at close range and with edged weaponry. The author has captured the mood of the garrison and the Turks and their allies like no other book I have read. Powerful characters who were so convinced to stand against overwhelming odds for months on end is remarkable and true. What an epic film this would make as some of the events ring true to this day. <br />A must read for anyone interested in the advent of gunpowder, heroic and defiant stands, massive battles and some incredible characters like the leader of the knights, La Valette who was seventy years old while leading the defense himself! Most enjoyable book of this nature that I have ever read. Powerful stuff.	2005-08-16

This old three masted vessel was captured by the Germans and converted to a shipping lane raider. The captain, von Luckner is of the old breed, honorable, intelligent, devoted to duty and most cunning. His crew is a collection of skilled sailors (of the old sailing school), tough German Marines (used for boarding enemy ships) and able seamen with one goal - capture and sink as many enemy ships as possible before the Royal Navy finds them. The research is top notch, the characters are truly amazing and the actions of the Sea Eagle are most incredible. Von Luckner's handling of the scores of captured enemy crews is terrific as is his style of 'bluffing' the enemy to submit to his will. Great old sea faring story set during World War One with plently of action, great adventure in distant places and a subject not usually associated with the Great War. Highly recommended.

Once more, Mr Kent has propelled the reader into the turbulent and dangerous waters of adventure. Richard Bolitho is once again locked in mortal combat with not only the French but ruthless Barbary pirates. Some terrific actions sequences as Bolitho is in a battered Spanish vessel that he just captured. The ship is beset by the pirates and one of the most thrilling sea fights you can read about takes place. Great high adventure. Many characters people this novel, some new and dangerous and many others that prove more friendly. Great old friendships are rekindled, some tragic events and some heroic actions.

Bolitho's adventures take him to duty blockading the French, then off to the distant edges of empire. The salt spray and billowing mainsails assail the reader with a sense of being aboard HMS Hyperion in rough seas and dangerous waters.<BR>Again, Bolitho's private life seems to glow like a fresh candle, but reality quickly sets in as tragedy strikes, his brother appears and his brother's son steps aboard as a midshipman. Plenty of crackling cannon fire, splintered quarterdecks, flaming hulks, nasty Frenchmen who seem to ignore the conduct of behavior in war, a near mutiny as Bolitho, his incompetent commadore and his trusted friends Inch, Allday and Herrick help Sir Richard face danger and death on the high seas. The chapters when Bolitho leads a party across a swamp in small cutters is remarkable. Powerful stuff and makes one feel apart of the crew.

Although not one of the best in the series, this novel captures the grim life at sea and the struggle against nature. In this book, brutal smugglers ply the English Channel between Holland, France and England. The central characters are well written and alive with problems, dialog and several seem destined to re-appear in future Bolitho novels. However, Mr. Kent seemed to have Bolitho dwell in his past too many times. A dark, brooding side of the naval hero seems to fill many pages, but it does make Sir Richard that much more of a fleshed out character. He does feel for his dead friends, former ships and in some cases, former enemies. That aside, the tale moves along like a nimble sixth-rater with all sheets unfurled in a  southern wind. The action is swift and brutal as Bolitho gives battle to the smugglers and their allies. Stormy weather, plenty of thunderous cannon fire, smashed bulkheads, parted ratlines and terrified crewmen. The author once again details the sea as an angry foe without mercy. The battle at the end of the book between a couple of corvettes and three cutters is suberb Kent writting. A welcome addition to the collection none the less. Well worth reading and blends seamlessly into the very next novel. An excellent series that has re-defined nautical fiction.	2001-12-12

Being an ardint fan of Mr. Cussler and have read all of Pitt's amazing adventures, I would say this epic tale is near the top of my favorites. However, some of the story seems cloned from other books he has written. The fiendish villain is again beyond the reach of the law, wealthy beyond belief and has some neferous and murderous blackguards as his henchmen. Plenty of narrow escapes, some classy dames in distress, a terrific dogfight over the concrete canyons of New York City that is a memorable classic.<BR>The mix includes the Jules Verne, the CSS Hunley's tactics, some mad Vikings, madcap inventors, classic automobiles from Pitt's/Cussler's fabulous collection, did I mention some lucious gals and Al's wise cracks? <BR>But, please, no more cameo appearences by Cussler.

I feel this would throw off a novice reader. However, the story of Richard Meinertzhagen is incredible, a true Victorian son, with a life that was filled with danger, travel, big game hunting, perilous adventures we can only dream of and meetings with some of the most influential men in the 20th century. I would have given the book another star, but the writing was haphazard. Meinertzhagen, a service British officers, fought in Africa against the only German general who wasn't defeated, Lettow-Vorbeck. He escaped death on countless occasions, brutally killing many times, with pistol, rifle, bayonet and knobkerrie war club. He served in the Arabian area under Allenby, using his intelligence gathering skills to great advantage for the allies. He survived a ship being torpedoed off the coast of Italy in 1917, over Palistine, his two man plane was shot to pieces by a German fighter, wounding the pilot. Meinertzhagen managed to land the plane and walk from it. He outwitted German intelligence officers on many occasions, once dropping opium laced cigarettes over Turkish lines, the trick worked and when a major British offense began, many Turks were unable to stand or talk.  He was an avid Zionist and befreinded T E Lawrence as they struggled to help the Israeli state develope. He debated the Zionist movement with Churchill and lobbied at the Peace treaties in Paris. He was almost killed on the very last day of the war.  In the 1930's, after much travel, he met with Ribbontrop and Hitler. On the third visit, Meinertzhagen pocketed a revolver and could have easily used it on Hitler, altering history to no end. When he first met Hitler in Berlin, Hitler greeted him with &quot;Heil Hitler.&quot; Not hear of this infamous cry, Meinertzhagen replied &quot;Heil Meinertzhagen&quot;. No one was amused in Hitler's chambers. An interesting book to read nonetheless, aside from the late author's flash forward dialogs and comments. A truly unique and interesting man.	2001-07-13

The book, written in a compelling and detailed style, covers the inept handling of the incident, the dedication to duty by the troops involved and the boldness and bravery of the Marines. I have read and followed the accounts about the infamous &quot;Mayaquez Incident&quot; since it happened in May of 1975. This book is the best available, filled with details left out of the newspapers, magazine articles and political babble from the Pentagon. The book follows the course of events from the capture of the ship, details about the crew's reactions, the ill-prepared military and political reactions and finally to the landing of the Marines on Koh Tang Island. The Marines were told that only a handful of Cambodians were on the island where they thought the captive crew were taken. Instead, hundreds of combat experienced Khmer Rouge troops surprised the helicopters as they brought in Marines. The resulting firefight lasted nearly two days of non stop combat, dozens of men were wounded, helicopters were downed, a 15,000 pound bomb was dropped haphazardly on the island by the Air Force, pockets of Marines were surrounded and nearly overrun on several occasions. Pilots risked their crew and aircraft many times bringing in more troops and pulling out casualties. Cambodian participants are interviewed at length in this acount as are American combatants. A government cover up followed the events as the losses were tabulated, 41 men dead, dozens wounded, one dead Marine left behind wrapped in a poncho and three members of a machine gun team left behind during the harried withdrawl. A sad closure to a sad episode of American history. Mr. Wetterhan's book should be manditory reading at West Point and in the White House, and next to Black Hawk Down is some of the finest material about modern combat. As a veteran, I was proud of the job done by the militarypersonnel, and when one corporal was ordered to act as a last rear guard for the evacuation of the Marine force, he turned for volunteers and ten men raised their hands immediately. Bravery and honor. Well researched and rich in detail and with maps to follow the events make this fine reading and a lession Americans should never forget. Thumbs up, Ralph.

The book follows the course of events from the capture of the ship, details about the crew's reactions, the ill-prepared military and political reactions and finally to the landing of the Marines on Koh Tang Island. The Marines were told that only a handful of Cambodians were on the island where they thought the captive crew were taken. Instead, hundreds of combat experienced Khmer Rouge troops surprised the helicopters as they brought in Marines. The resulting firefight lasted nearly two days of non stop combat, dozens of men were wounded, helicopters were downed, a 15,000 pound bomb was dropped haphazardly on the island by the Air Force, pockets of Marines were surrounded and nearly overrun on several occasions. Pilots risked their crew and aircraft many times bringing in more troops and pulling out casualties. Cambodian participants are interviewed at length in this acount as are American combatants. A government cover up followed the events as the losses were tabulated, 41 men dead, dozens wounded, one dead Marine left behind wrapped in a poncho and three members of a machine gun team left behind during the harried withdrawl. A sad closure to a sad episode of American history. Mr. Wetterhan's book should be manditory reading at West Point and in the White House, and next to Black Hawk Down is some of the finest material about modern combat. As a veteran, I was proud of the job done by the militarypersonnel, and when one corporal was ordered to act as a last rear guard for the evacuation of the Marine force, he turned for volunteers and ten men raised their hands immediately. Bravery and honor. Well researched and rich in detail and with maps to follow the events make this fine reading and a lession Americans should never forget. Thumbs up, Ralph. Job well done.	2001-06-14

War With Mexico, 18461848	Books	5	42	46	N	Y	Excellent account of the war with Mexico	As with all the other books by Mr Eisenhower that I have read, this one is very well done. His telling of this conflict, with the dozens of characters on both sides, the vicious bloody battles, the harrowing marches across a brutal landscape round out the story of this little known war. The text has several superb maps that allow the reader to follow the combatants. His information on the St Patrick's Battalion (Irishmen who deserted the US Army before and during the war) is detailed and interesting. Santa Ana is shown as an egotistical commander who had little regard for the welfare of his men, Taylor and Scott are portrayed as men with faults and certain military skills. Overall, an interesting read, it won't disapoint those with a thirst for this conflict.	2001-06-13

With Sharpe departing India and sailing aboard an English warship, he soon becomes embroiled with a renegade, an unfaithful wife, a wealthy and jealous husband, a scattering of nautical characters worthy of Kent and Pope not to mention some terrific descriptions of life at sea aboard a King's ship. The author once again demonstrates his uncanny ability of placing our hero in some dangerous prediciments, with some splendid details about ship board hazards and some rousing sea battles and some rather torrid romantic interludes as well. A worthy addition to the collection, filled with adventure, thundering battle and splintered decks, romance and sudden death. I hope that Mr Cornwall considers doing a few books featuring a new naval hero, his writing style would capture that quite well. Once again, Sharpe marches on.	2001-05-21
US	52556035	R1JE5SDW8OPWEI	0679447172	284000734	The Gates of the Alamo	Books	4	2	2	N	N	An epic adventure during the Texas revolution	While I felt the book was bit too long, it was however filled with interesting and colorful characters, great descriptions of the lonely vastness of Texas and the hardy folk who peopled that region. Mr. Harrigan did a good job of blending in fact, lore and some good dialog between the characters. His viewpoint from the Mexican side of events was well done and well researched and with some terrific character cross over meetings. The march of Santa Anna's army during their northern advance was excellently told. The growing unrest between the Texians and the Mexicans was captured in such a fashion as to make both side clearly understood. I did find the main character of Mary a tad boring at times, her broken nose was a nice touch, but she seemed to be propelled by guilt through the entire book. The botonist was pretty colorless and flat in my viewpoint. He just didn't seem to fit the role but maybe that was the intent. When the storyline is directed into the events at the Alamo, the book excels. The chapters about the actual battle and the aftermath were superbly written, drawing the reader into the darkness and misery and fear that must have stood beside each defender. I liked the concept of Crockett leaving the compound to seek reinforcements, based on fact I've read. But there was no mention of one Louis Rose, who actually left the Alamo before the place was sealed off and the reference of rockets being used by Santa Ana was a pleasant surprise. The author did mention red flags being used to signal &quot;no quarter, no prisoners&quot; but he did not mention the &quot;deguello&quot; (from the Spanish verb that meant &quot;to slit the throat&quot;- degollar, which was the sorrowful, somber and haunting bugle tune. I felt this was a powerful instrument to instill fear in one's enemies and was used by Santa Ana for several years before the Alamo. All in all, the novel was lengthy but rich in detail, good balance of characters and their lives, graphic scenes involving the Goliad massacre and the fight inside the Alamo itself. A worthy topic of a TV or cable mini series. I highly recommend the old Republic flim &quot;The Last Command&quot; with Serling Hayden as a good partner to this novel. It is available through Amazon and worth checking out.	2001-04-13

Coupled with a slave ring of illegal immigrants from China, a gang of  ruthless killers stalking Pitt and a lovely Chinese American INS agent,  Cussler weaves an interesting tale and even writes himself into this story  that was both clever and humorous. Plenty of narrow escapes, witty dialog,  a nefarious villian (but a close group of henchmen was missing) and a great  story of a missing passenger ship fleeing the Communist take over of China  and a fortune of vanished artifacts. Blend these together and it spells  another terrific tale from Cussler. Not the best, but certainly  entertaining reading and not to be passed over. Once again, Al, Sandecker  and company work with Pitt who uses his charm, snappy come backs and his   trusty .45 Colt to save the day.	2000-09-15

His attention to detail is excellent and covers (although not  in as much depth as it could have) the various factors involved in this  unique conflict. He points out the weakness of the military, the lack of  proper medical, supply and weaponry, but he does explain the courage and  determination of the common soldier and the terrible problems they faced.  The fight for San Juan Hill was done a bit too quickly, but covered the  basics. The book is broken down into compact chapters that lets the reader  learn about the war in digestible segments. All together, a most readable  book for the novice and experienced history buff, but could have been much  longer and filled with more information about the various units and  relative personalties. In fact, Frederick Funston is only mentioned once  and General Henry Lawton needed more ink. A good book to round out one's  collection on the dawning of the American colonial period.	2000-08-23

A brilliant telling of both sides of the war, from  the political figures, Filipino field commanders, volunteer soldiers from  Oregon and Kansas, the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;, Marines, Moros  wielding their razor-edged barongs to generals like Lawton, Merritt,  Pershing, Funston and Arthur MacArthur.

It is an excellent story of one officer's experiences across the American west and finally to the Philippines where he had some horrific encounters with  outlaw bands, Moro brigands who seemed bullet proof and fearless. His  adventures are well written and filled with period knowledge and his  vantage point was always from the saddle or between bamboo stalks while  Moro bandits slashed away with their razor-edged barongs. Suberb history  that should be taught in school. Also recommended &quot;Muddy Glory&quot;  and &quot;Little Brown Brother&quot; for some top-notch history during  America's first Vietnam.	2000-07-28

His angle of story is about the American soldiers (many who had fought Indians, in Cuba against the  Spanish, Boxers in China and then against Filipinos and Moro tribesmen)and  their incredible conflict. While doing research on the Philippine  Constabulary, I found and read this terrific book, packed with dozens of  combat actions, forced marches across jungled peaks, close range  engagements with bolo-slashing Moro pirates and so called insurrectionists.  The pages are alive with some truely heroic Americans, Funston, Lawton,  MacArthur, Pershing, John White and one Leonard Furlong of the Constabulary  to name but a few.  Fighting in strange surroundings and with limited  knowledge of the Filipino people and not understanding their desire for  freedom, the American army began a brutal and seemingly endless series of  campaigns to pacify entire tribes, cities, provinces and islands. The true  tales of blood maddened &quot;juramentados&quot; swinging a razor-sharp  barong and absorbing a dozen rifle bullets at close range are chilling to  say the least. Each chapter captures the various campaigns and tactics that  the Americans used, along with their hard earned Indian fighting skills to  suppress the insurrectionists. A classic account of the entire conflict  seen from the eyes of men who were in the tall reeds and palm grass.	2000-07-28

With America's new ownership of the Philippines, we were drawn into a second conflict once the Spanish were routed. The  insurrectionist movement against America brought about a bloody and savage  war that cost tens of thousands of lives. The third phase was the attempt  to subdue the Moros, some of the toughest and most fearless warriors on the  planet. The troops involved thought they would only be fighting Spanish  regulars and then sent home. Rather, many spent years fighting in jungles  and swamps against a clever and determined foe, and many were then shipped  off to fight the Boxer's in China in 1900, only to be returned to battle  the often fiendish inhabitants of places like Sibago Island, Jolo and  Samar.  A classic account and ranks with &quot;Muddy Glory&quot; and  &quot;Little Brown Brother&quot;  to name but a couple. There isn't much  written about this conflict, but the information is out there. These  lessons should have taught America about getting involved in smaller  nations affairs.	2000-07-28

The story was a bit compressed (perhaps from too much editing), but a good one. The  villians were not fleshed out enough, but the follow up characters were  first rate. Since I share the same last name as the main character of the  band of Confederates, I was curious to find out about his background and  fate. I think another one hundred pages would have made this little tale  that much better. The setting was good, the details of the weather and  terrain was colorful and realistic. Don't expect to read about massive  columns of infantry assaulting a fortified ridgeline or rows of thundering  artillery. Rather, it is a more personal journey written with a unique  style. A good read on a chilly weekend with a good cigar and glass of  Burgandy. Check it out.	2000-06-23

The events leading up to and after Lee' surrender are detailed and written in a compelling style. The known and unknown  characters that peopled the era are unique, interesting and in some cases  mysterious. The final battles are well researched and the maps are superbly  drawn allowing the reader to follow the course of action.

Their prime target is America and their military plans include the physcial domination of the US. An  excellent cast of characters people this book, ranging from the president's  daughter in the infantry, a special forces officer (who has some thrilling  missions to fulfill), various civilians and politicians on both sides make  for a rousing adventure. The various phases of the Chinese attack is kept  to the readers imagination, except for the actual assaults, which are very  realistic and tense. There is a great ambush at a filling station that was  awesome. I did, however, feel the ending was a bit flat with a weak wrap-up  - unless a sequel is in the works. I did find a few inaccurate terms and a  couple of blatant typos, but it never detracted from the story. Some of the  major characters just seem to vanish towards the final scenes, but the  incident on the damaged bridge over the Potomac River was superb.

The central character, Surgeon Colonel Simon Wolfe, is a unique since he is  a one armed Union army officer who stumbles into a series of gruesome  murders amid the massive destruction of the Shenandoah Valley campaign of  General Phil Sheridan. As Wolfe endevors to solve the murders, it seems  nearly everyone in the chain of command is suspect, even the egotistical  George Custer, who appears through the novel. Custer is handled very well,  a nice touch. There are plenty of surprises and suspect twists. There is a  great female character, a Dunker woman, who adds much to this haunting  tale. There is a terrific scene when the captured doctor is brought before  the legendary Confederate raider, John Mosby, the Grey Ghost. Plenty of gun  smoke, thundering musket fire, muddy marches, screaming wounded and a fresh  look at the crude and ghastly medical practices of the day. I did find one  major error, during one scene when the enraged, one-armed doctor is about  to confront Sheridan as a prime suspect, the doctor suddenly seems to grow  a new appendage for several paragraphs, he is gripping something in one  coat pocket, then clutching something in the other and he is described as  squeezing his fists. A major goof when trying to keep a rather detailed and  lengthy and blood murder mystery going. But over all, a decent read. I also  recommend his other Civil War novel, Fredericksburg. I did a reveiw on that  one a few weeks back, check it out. I would like to see Hollywood grab this  and give it to a good director and cast.	2000-01-22

The characters were a nice collection of personalites, the unit information was well  handled, the factual figures were done well, and the dialog between the  fictional and factual characters were superb. But the central characters  needed to be fleshed out a bit more. Some of them, I couldn't relate to or  feel much compassion.

Having stood  behind the stone wall at Marye's Heights recently, one can only imagine  what the Union soldiers must have thought as they stormed repeatedly into a  virtual hail of hostile ordinance.	1999-12-21

This one has Riley assisting a lady friend from the previous book, a Chicago police detective, with a Mob member who goes into the Witness Security Program. Things go  wrong as people are murdered, hired killers pursue Riley and company across  the wilderness to a terrific climax. No one can be trusted, phones are  tapped, ruthless professional hit men and government agents are using all  their skills and power to stop the witness and his wife and whoever they  are with. Then Riley enters the picture and with his military skills and  courage tries to outwit the killers. Great storyline, the plot is filled  with turns and corners. Fresh dialog and smooth action scenes propel the  reader into this nebulous and dangerous world. Good stuff, Bob. More Dave  Riley. I am currenly waiting for Eternity Base and I cannot locate a copy  of Z anywhere. Keep up the great work, Robert, the ending to this one  sizzles. Also, check out The Line and The Gate (written as Bob McGuire) for  more adventures with a twist.	1999-12-09

A really enjoyable read, plenty of suspense, good character developement, a lot of inside info on Green Beret team spirit and  their mission planning and fighting ability. A great plot and the fast pace  keep the reader guessing until the end. A special ops into China that  suddenly goes awry with some cost to the team involved. I sure hope HBO  grabs the Riley series and works on them, a sure fire hit for the action  fans. Also highly recommended by Mr Mayer (writing  as Bob McGuire) are The  Line and The Gate. Terrific books. Keep 'em coming, Bob. In fact, I will be  loaning the books I have read to a couple of buddies.	1999-12-09

The story is well written, with tight descriptions and an active plot, plenty of nefarious villians, twists and turns and enough  shoot-'em up action, crips dialog and a lot of heroics. Find this book as  well as the rest of the series, they are worth reading. Great treat on a  rainy afternoon. I hope HBO picks up the series and does something good  with them.	1999-12-09

A splendid mixture of a government science project gone wrong, Special Forces operations, the CIA and the army. When genetically enhanced creatures, Synbats, escape from  their creators and raise havoc with anyone in their path, Riley's team is  assigned to clean up the mess. Terrific plot, great characters, nifty  dialog, plenty of explosive action and some really creepy scenes with the  creatures lurking in the shadows and sewer tunnels in Chicago. A good blend  of action, dialog and comradeship. This would make a great action movie if  handled right. Find this series if you enjoy action adventure books with a  twist. The books are hard to find in some cases, but they are out there.  Check out Mayer's other books, The Gate and The Line (written as Bob  McGuire) for more splendid action novels. More Dave Riley.	1999-12-09

The story was excellent, the action non-stop and believable, the characters were superb, a few were  under-developed, but none the less, a great effort among the growing fleet  of salt-encrusted authors. I enjoyed the historical information (like how  were the number of Royal Marines assigned to each vessel), as well as the  action and suspense. Plenty of snapping mainsails, splintering deck  planking, screaming roundshot, thrusting pikes, flashing cutlasses and  daring seamanship. The chapter on prison hulks and the rescue mission was  well done. In fact, I was a bit saddened by the deaths of some of the  various crewmen. I would highly recommend this work and it deserves a place  on your book shelf next to Hornblower, Ramage, Drinkwater or the incredible  Biolitho. I look forward to the next novel with many of the same  characters. Bravo, Mr. Friend, more Captain Tremayne and Lt. Hale, terrific  characters.	1999-12-02
US	52556035	R2CZLVZ3JC6W11	0380792648	724743548	Subterranean	Books	3	62	78	N	N	A decent adventure tale, but...	James Rollins has put together an intertaining novel about this hidden world beneath the ice, it starts out very well, with the impending  expedition that was great reading, but - the characters are pretty wooden,  the action became a bit forced, the creatures were good and the lost race  was unique to a degree but the lust of the main character Ben grew quickly  tiresome. The villianous Khalid was a good additon, but he could have been  fleshed out more. The Navy SEAL's were a good touch, but the rank of  &quot;major&quot; isn't a naval rating. The annoying use of the term  &quot;soldier&quot; was applied incorrectly to describe the SEAL's. The  author should become more familiar with modern weaponry and the military  before placing them into another novel. Some of the characters were always  grinding or gnashing their teeth, most irritating. Over all, fun to read,  but not written well and a very weak ending, please, no sequel. It would  make a terrific film, however.	1999-10-23
US	52556035	R2TDYYSO55OTE8	0312958749	158883658	The Line	Books	5	0	1	N	Y	A slam-bang adventure thriller	Mr. McGuire does it again, The Line is an excellent, fast-paced story filled with intrigue, deception, murder, military history, Special Forces, renegade generals, snappy dialog and a good story. The Line should be  filmed just as the book is written. Great characters, villains abound,  heroics that are believable and enough gunfire to satisfy and plenty of  plot twists. McGuire has a knack for blending in landmarks, terrain,  character, dialog and story pacing. I recommend this novel and The Gate,  both are excellent reading for the thriller genre.	1999-10-11
US	52556035	R1015XAYQCC2XJ	0312962789	499688192	The Gate	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	Outstanding, action-packed adventure tale	The Gate was an excellant, thrill-packed literary ride. A splendid mixture of fictional action and actual or imagined historical events. Being a native of San Francisco, I paid attention to his geographic details and  found only a couple of minor ones. The action, the drama, dialog and  characters were well-paced and fleshed out just enough to keep the story  going. North Korean commandos, Yakuza killers, rogue CIA gunmen, wacko  milita-types, murder, great plot-twists, mayhem and a great plot were all  handled exceptionally well. Mr. McGuire has a minor thriller classic here.  A terrific film if done correctly. I finished this one and promptly began  reading The Line. Entertaining page-turning nighttime reading. Check it  out.	1999-10-02

This book is filled with informative information for anyone with an  interest in the Age of Sail, the battles, the famous ships and commanders.  If anybody reads the Kent, O'Brien, Pope or Forrester novels, this book  will assist in rounding out the overall picture, a couple of sterling  examples are the promotion system and how the ships were rated. Excellent  and often humorous account.	1999-08-30
US	52556035	RHKMOWLRKYYVZ	0671013815	960189125	The Continental Risque (Revolution at Sea Saga #3)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A well-paced and exciting nautical adventure story	The third novel in the series (a fourth is due out soon) is the best one yet. An exciting tale alive with history, battles, political turmoil, courage and cowardice. Captain Biddlecomb has developed into a seaworthy  character who is brave, cunning and much to his discomfort, a patriot. The  regional distrust between northern and southern politicians were most  interesting, since most of the naval vessels were built, crewed and sailed  from northern ports. The first contigent of Marines was a superb touch as  was the first landings on a foreign shore. Much insight into the actual  sailing of ships, positions of shore batteries, fortresses, local  commanders were all presented in a fresh fashion. An excellent read, and am  looking forward to the fourth novel. As I mentioned in my reviews of the  first two books, far too many nautical terms that most landlubbers won't  understand.  But some really terrific sea battles, storms, neferous  characters and dialog. I would like to see more books by Mr. Nelson, who  really knows about sailing ships, perhaps the War of 1812, the Seminole War  or something with the Barbary pirates. Perhaps another nautical series  could develope about the Civil War featuring Biddlecomb's son(s)?  That  would be something to really look forward to.	1999-08-11
