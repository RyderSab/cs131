The year is 1553 and Scotland has joined forces with it's powerful alliance, France. Mary is sent of to France to become one of the family there, and one day to marry King Henry II of France's son: Francis. With a group of four Marys and her governess, Mary writes about each day of her life at the Courts in France, and dream of the days she will be queen of Scotland and France. This book mainly portrays Mary in her carefree days as a child, making friends and playing games, basically having fun. It was interesting reading about Mary as a youngster, an 11 year old girl, travelling at all the richest mansions, manors and castles in France. I also found the rivalry between Mary and Catherine of France, wife of King Henry hilarious! This is a fantastic edition to the Royal Diaries.	2005-07-16

She is also pretty scared of her brother and lets him take over her. Most bits of this diary are quite sad and i loved the way Isabele only announces her true character in the end. When I sabel loses three beloved ones she meets the prince of her dreams and wants to marry him instantly. She also wants to become the Queen of Spain and live in luxury with her husband. The diary of this lady knight who will fight for her freedom is tragic but in the end something rather pleasant occurs. Im not going to tell you! You read the book and see! I will give this book an a+ and is definitely one of the top 5 royal diaries. A pure classic	2005-06-23
