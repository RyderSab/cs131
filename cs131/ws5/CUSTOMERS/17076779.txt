Reading this book confirmed many things to me, but one stuck out more than any: Assata Shakur is a woman, a black woman at that, and a black revolutionary woman on top of that. She had it rougher than just about any of the Black personalities at the time. With all that, she did the things she did because she felt they were right. You can see the passion she has for her people in the pages, and you can also see the work in progress which was her throughout the story. I think some people fail to remember how young some of these folks were at the time. A lot of the young Black revolutionaries were in their early-to-mid 20's during the 1960's, which makes this even more amazing. Some people may take offense, which I can understand, but at least give her the benefit of the doubt; read and absorb what she is saying and how she was treated especially while in prison before you come to a conclusion.	2005-08-29

There are other works out there, but this book has managed to capture the true essence of us and our significance. The contributors to this book touched on just about every topic imaginable, so to me, anyone from old-school greeks, to new-school ones can relate. The authors do an exceptional job of tracing the origins of BGLOs back to Africa with the customs, rituals, dances, etc. They also do a remarkable job explaining what issues were facing not only BGLO's, but black people in general at the time. There was some information in the book I already knew, but there was so much more that I never knew existed, and seeing it for the first time is indeed a blessing. There was so much knowledge gained from this book from start to finish, for one, because the authors did their research, and because they touched on issues rarely touched. It shows much of an influence BGLOs have and will continue to have in the future.	2005-08-05

Unlike other stories or the such you may read or see about pimps, Goines gave this one some depth. He wasn't some fast-talking cat who just wasted money and used women. It was different, because he exposed a vulnerability there you rarely see in a character like this. It's a good read that will have you hooked to the finish.	2005-06-21

This book is all those words I described above and some. As a man, it was funny to read about how some of us told their stories. Some described infidelity as if it was something we're born with, while some tried to put it all on the woman which is totally unfair. It's very entertaining and a book I would recommend it to anyone.	2005-06-13

I was split on my views when I read pieces from his speech, and it remains both after reading this book by Dr. Dyson. Dyson does a great job of doing his research, and then speaking about the issues surrounding the black poor. There were times when I thought he became exhaustive in his approach on certain issues Cosby critiqued; at the same time, I felt there were extremely important factors Cosby left out when he addressed the poor in his speeches. Those factors Dr. Dyson made sure he covered in the book. Cosby is right saying that we must stop making excuses for our standing in this country. On the other hand, Dyson is correct in saying there are structural and institutional factors which cannot be ignored that are keeping the poor where they are. Hopefully, this book can help encourage some solutions to this problem instead of continuing to fingerpoint and making no progress.	2005-06-07

A white man is murdered in a rural town, and the locals are coming for blood from guess who, a black man. Only it is not as simple as it seems. Years of frustration and fear from the black locals have finally run their course, and they decide to take a stand. The story is set in the '70 in the deep south, so race relations are still very much strained between blacks and whites. There are events in the story which will surprise you, but for the most part, it leaves you with a mixture of emotions, some good, some bad, some unfortunate, and some which may leave you proud depending on who the reader is.	2005-05-20

The characters are very realistic, and for people who are married, they may be able to relate to a lot of what the characters in the book are going through. The man is having an affair, but it is not as simple as it seems on the surface. He and his wife, due to an unfortunate event, are forced to go back in time and examine their past, unveiling some secrets which seemed to be forgotten. The man in the story seemed to be some nymphomaniac, always craving sex, which in a way, made me feel sorry for his lady, but you have to read the story to see why I'm saying this. I gave it four outta five, because there were some spots where the main character(Genevieve's husband) did and said some stuff that ran me hot, and this is coming from a man. Nonetheless, it's definitely another good one by Dickey.	2005-05-20

I wrote one back in July, and now I'm writing from the perspective of a person who has gone through a process and made it through to join a BGL fraternity. Dr. Jones needs to be commended for writing a book of this nature. One thing about some of the incidents in the book is there are some brothers and sisters who get carried away and do reckless hazing, but those are a few out of the majority. The ones who brought me through were more concerned about what I would bring to the fraternity and what I planned on doing with my life from here onward, and that is what it is about. It is unfortunate that there are some individuals, such as the ones described in the book, who go to unnecessary lengths and put their respective organizations at risk. I, like many other people who are in Black greek-letter frats and sororities, do not want to see our demise due to foolishness and other events which could easily be prevented. I don't know if there is a solution which could be applied across the board to make sure some of this can cease; it may take something being done chapter by chapter, because it is pretty much impossible to monitor what everyone is doing at the same time. For anyone who plans on going Greek, or who is already Greek, I strongly recommend this book.	2005-05-03

Once you begin to read it, most likely you won't want to put it down. The author begins by telling stories of two different people, Porter Washington and Winona Fairchild, with completely different lives but with similar issues. They are both in a major transition period in their lives; most of their battles were internal and somehow the author was able to make them entertaining. By fate, they were able to meet up and the story picked up even more steam. After I read it, I was convinced either the Ms. Robinson knows people such as the ones in the book, or she has the greatest imagination I have ever seen. This is a book where you will make yourself read it from beginning to end just from there being so many twists and turns. So far, I've read two of her books and they have both been top-notch with me.	2005-04-11

There are a lot of his films I have not seen yet, but after reading the many interviews and getting more out of Lee than ever, I'm motivated to own all of his films. It was cool to see how he comes up with his scripts, some of the challenges he faced in bringing them to life, and some of the criticizing he gets constantly about him, and not his work. He seems to be very aware of who he is and is also aware of the fact he cannot do this alone. He gives props to people throughout the interviews, from the woman who plays Nola in \\"She's Gotta Have It\\" to Ernest Dickerson, to Jada Pinkett Smith, to John Singleton, and so on. The one thing I gained more than anything though is he really makes people think when you watch his movies and when you hear or read what he has to say. Love him or hate him, you have to respect him. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of his work and to people who may not know much about him other than what is seen in the media.	2005-02-19

This book is filled with Dr. Dyson tackling many subjects, including the O.J Simpson trial, Michael Jordan, Mariah Carey and the issues surrounding her identity in the eyes of the viewing public (black and white), and others as well. It's not necessarily a tough read; the title of the book is simply misleading. While I read it, I could see the link he attempts to make with his audience while he discusses various subjects, but it is pretty difficult to follow. It's \\"Between God and Gangsta Rap\\", but it takes a long time to bridge the links together, and that is what frustrated me. I didn't need certain issues in the book to understand others, but it may take that for other people who read it. The one piece I did enjoy was one about a pastor who is revered in the African-American community, Gardner \\"Wash\\" Taylor. Besides that, the book didn't do too much for me, and that is unfortunate, because I am a huge Michael Eric Dyson fan. It will really just depend on what type of reader you are as to whether you like or dislike the book, or whether you finish or don't finish it.	2005-02-11

The main character (Eldorado Red) runs a few numbers houses, but his son Buddy and some of his friends rob them. After that, its clearly on. He doesn't fail to paint a picture the entire time, two scenes stuck out in particular for me. One of a mass of roaches which made my stomach crawl, and one of a fight toward the end with a hitman and a young dude where the latter gets his arm broken. The ending is pretty good too, so from top to bottom, its another solid piece from Donald Goines.	2005-01-19

In this book, you will find plenty of insight from people who knew him well. Jada Pinkett Smith, Leila Steinberg, Warren G, and plenty others give their thoughts, feelings, and opinions on this multidimensional man. One part that caught me was the amount of reading 'Pac did. His detractors constantly talk about all the negativity but rarely discuss the many things he did which were positive, and Dyson does his part to bring that to everyone who reads this book. Some of the information you will already know due to the fact that there is so much of Pac to go around, but there are some things which can be gained from the book. 'Pac was a representative of EVERY young black man in America in some sort of fashion, not EXACTLY the same, but there was a lil bit of all of us in him. Whether brothers confess to that is up to them. The trials, tribulations, ups, and the downs of this man are things we all have went through or are currently going through as of this moment. A very solid piece of work by Dr. Dyson.	2005-01-17

It's pretty much the same formula of most of his writings, but there is a movie out based on the book, so that should count for something. On top of that, Goines ALWAYS finds a way to distinguish the main characters in all his books. The main character (King David) tells his story in reverse, which is something that isn't seen in Goines' other works. The King gets killed pretty early, but that's where all the fun begins. I started watching the movie, but stopped, because I wanted to finish the book first. Going from what I've seen so far though, there aren't too many differences with the movie and the book.	2005-01-17

Jefferson is wrongly accused of the murder of three men and is sentenced to death. Leading up to those last days, Jefferson losing all hope and thinks of himself as less than a man, less than a human, and that is where Mr. Wiggins comes in, reluctantly, to help him. There are many lessons which can be taken from this novel. I chose the title of the review, because toward the end of the story Grant Wiggins and the reverend of the local church, who has also done his part to help Jefferson ease the upcoming pain, get into a heated exchange. The reverend tells Grant he may be educated when it comes to subjects taught in schools, but he wasn't educated in life for many reasons which you will see as you read the story. Surprisingly, or not, in the end, the person who has the most to fear shows none. It is a great story which people should be able to relate to in one way or another.	2005-01-09

For starters, I read some of the reviews of this book before I picked it up to read. Most at least acknowledged there is work to be done so some of the fear, anxiety, and uncertainty about discussing racism can cease. Others took this book as a personal attack on them, and lo and behold, I saw exactly why as I read the book. Dr. Tatum did not write this book with the intention of threatening anyone group of people; rather she wrote it addressing a problem which has occured for centuries. She broke it down with the most simplistic question one could pose, which served as the title of the book. People (keep in mind they are Black, as well as White, Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern, and so on) who get all upset and bent out of shape over what they read in the book most likely are the same people who believe either racism does not exist, or shy away from it and never want to discuss it. Therefore, they take the content of the book as a personal attack, and it is seen in their reviews of the book. Once you see them, you can tell they never gave her a chance to get in-depth on the topic of racism, racial identity, and so forth. I go to a university where there are a number of nationalities present. The Black students for the most part sit together in the student union, as do the White students, Asian students, Hispanic students, Middle Eastern students, and so forth. People are involved in a variety of organizations, fraternities, sororities, multicultural organizations, and so on. This book discusses not only Black-White relations, but other racial relations with people of color. It discusses affirmative action and its ACTUAL MEANING and who the beneficiaries are (no, it doesn't only serve to help Black folks) as well as identity development for biracial individuals, which is something that is extremely overlooked in my opinion. There are plenty of examples and accounts from students, as well as administrators, addressing their encounters when discussing racism, racial identity, and its effects. There is even a portion in the book that deals with the number of different religions on a college campus and how one particular institution was able to accomodate everyone so they would have somewhere to exercise their beliefs comfortably. This book can help anyone and everyone address this problem and discuss it in a very constructive, critical, and even refreshing way if done properly and with patience. If you pick this book up and read it with an open mind, you should gain something from it, and whether you decide to build on it is up to you.tity, and its effects.

For me, I saw some of my mother, a little of my ex, some of my co-workers, some from other black women I've come across in my life, and so forth. At the beginning of the book he talks about three types of love: platonic, romantic, and self-love. There's a simple way of evaluating how much of each you have in your lives, and I found myself asking that question as I read the book. The book is sort of in the mold of works by bell hooks and other writers, speakers, and such who are advocates of self-love. There are stories about the mother/daughter relationship, stories about dating, and some about what men want from Strong Black Women today. That section really caught my attention, because I was eager to see what some men had to say about sisters and so forth. This section, as well as the others, gets very in-depth, so you should be able to take a piece from every section and apply it to your life and situation. The author interviewed people in the ages from as early as their 20s to as late as their 80s and 90s, so there is a diverse collection of stories, comments and such in the book. There are many lessons which can be taken from this book, so that in itself makes it worth checking out.	2004-12-27

More than that, it also talks about many other significant issues such as women's roles during that time, the way certain people saw various events before, during, and after the times. Be prepared to be patient when you read this. Dr. Bass takes her time and goes way back with her research leading up to the games in the late 60's. There were some areas I was not too interested in, such as some scientists' claims that black superiority in the athletic arena is due to biological and genetic advantages. Yet there were other times in the book like when Tommie Smith explained the MEANING, the TRUE MEANING, behind he and Carlos' actions that really made me take it in and appreciate the courage they had to take a stand at that time on that particular stage. From the black socks to the scarf Smith wore on his neck to both of them not wearing shoes on the victory stand while the national anthem played. More than just discussing the Olympics, she digs deep into the perception of the black athlete, from the 1930's when Jesse Owens was the man to the 60's, and to the 90's with Michael Jordan. Like I said earlier though, be prepared to be patient when you are reading this. There were some parts that I had to bear with to get to what I wanted to read, but all in all, it's a read that can definitely challenge your views not only about the black athlete, but sports and life in general.	2004-12-19

He was a strong supporter of young people taking up any art form, whether it be arts, music, dance, and in this case, poetry. In many pieces, we see various sides to the man many of us have come to love, miss, appreciate, and cherish. There is sure to be some of everyone in at least one of his pieces of poetry. For me, \\"The Eternal Lament\\", \\"If I Fail\\", \\"Liberty Needs Glasses\\", and \\"Jada\\" did them to me. Anyone who has read this incredible work will confess the same thing. This was the side of Tupac some of his detractors would swear did not exist. For his true fans, however, we are not surprised one bit. His legacy will be long-lasting, and this book is a testament to that.	2004-12-05

It starts off almost in a reflective state, with him speaking to his mother in his own way. He moves on to talk about his childhood, which was unpleasant to say the least. How he, along with many other people who live under those conditions, survived it is a testament to itself. He had a lot of help along the way from friends, family, associates, and many others. Those people really believed in him, because all he could offer at that time was his word. He moves on to talk about the civil rights struggle, which took on a huge part of his life as he got older. Remember this book was written in his early 30s, and as much as he gave ithat time, his gives even more and his impact on the black community as a whole was much bigger as he got older and gained more wisdom. The book will mkae you laugh, maybe cry at times, but most of all, it will make you think.	2004-11-21

He had a lot to say, and much of what he said made complete sense.  He wrote with extreme passion, and it lets me know he truly cares about the issue of democracy and his people.  The only issue I had with it was for someone who had an opinion on many subjects, especially black leadership, I was waiting to read something about HIM assuming a leadership role in an area where he seems extremely passionate about, but that moment never came.  Every one of us can make a difference as he said in the book, whether it is in our communities, churches, and schools.  I guess he did assume his own form of leadership by addressing some issues in the book, but I was waiting to hear how he would do it specifically.  I know there are plenty of issues concerning my community, but I cannot wait for some of the present national or more prominent members of the African-American community to come a long and fix them like in the 60's with Malcolm X, King, the Panthers, and all the other people or organizations of the past.  Some present ones have done the best they can, and some have not done a thing, but I cannot worry about them.  I have to go about it myself and hope there are others who are as passionate about it as I am and hope we can do it together.  That portion was the only one that drew my ire a little bit, but I loved the book nonetheless.  He brought plenty of issues to the forefront, and I respect his words and opinion.	2004-11-09

The book keeps Kenyatta, Betty, Ryan and Benson, and other familiar characters at the forefront, but brings many new ones to the scene as well and does a great job of giving us plenty of them. Like all of his stories, Goines has a way of detailing certain things that others wish they could possess, but don't. He also did something which is pretty tough to do when someone writes sequels or a series, and that is, this book, in my opinion, is the best of the four.	2004-11-02

This is what Miles Davis does to the T. There were times when I would be laughing nonstop because I could picture him saying these things right in front of me. He could cuss like none other, but it brought more authenticity to the work. He had a lot of respect for his peers, like Dizzy, Charlie Parker, and Coltrane to name a few. He had a DEEP respect for the history of jazz and wanted everyone to know that blacks deserve just due for really setting jazz music off. His knowledge of music, period, was unreal, especially now, because it seems that is what is LACKING BADLY with musicians of all genres today. He also speaks about other subjects, such as racism he encountered while in the business, his parents, siblings, and others. He also was his toughest critic, whether it came to his music, his dealings with women, other musicians, and drugs.

It starts off action-packed with a hi-jacking of an airplane, but then sort of dies down in the middle of the story. It picks up speed again later on, and towards the end, it keeps you guessing. It's a little different because Goines usually keeps his stories in the 'hood, but in this series, he has found himself branching out and having Kenyatta and his people going all over the country. Can't wait to read the finale.	2004-10-18

Eddie Allen Jr's book revealed more about the man and the events of his time as well as any other biography about another public figure. Surprisingly, or maybe not to some, Goines grew up in a stable household in which his father owned and operated his own business with the help of his supportive wife. There is no mention of drug use by his parents or other siblings while he grew up. It makes his story even more complicated, and makes people wonder as to why he chose the route he took. Allen takes us back to the turbulent times of the early 20th century and the events that took place, not only in the city of Detroit, but the country as a whole. He drew some interesting parallels, including one that links Goines' father and Joe Louis as buddies during Lewis' reign as champion of the world. That one aspect of Allen's work re-affirmed to me it is a small world indeed. Allen continues as he tells readers about Goines becoming a pimp, bootlegger, and later, being arrested and locked behind bars. He also tells plenty about Goines' increasingly dangerous habit of heroin, which he even displays to his younger sister, all the while, warning her if he ever caught her doing what he was showing her, he would kill her. It was a frightening and hypocritical display, but nonetheless, it most likely proved effective. Allen goes on to tell about Goines picking up the works of Iceberg Slim, and forming his own stories using Slim's as a blueprint, so to speak. Throughout the book, Allen provides plenty of documentation and other sources to prove this is indeed a work of authenticity, including a piece Goines wrote one year before his death entitled, \\"Private Thoughts on a Lonely Sunday, September 1, 1973.\\"  Allen also lets us know about Goines' inner struggle with his addiction, and how desperately he wanted to \\"kick\\" the habit out of his life. In the end, his struggles and other wrongdoings in the past came back to haunt him. Allen did a terrific job in not turning this into a sob story. Donald Goines was no saint, but he is admired by many, such as myself, for telling his own stories, his own life, using his imagination, and telling stories from the heart in the most vivid, brutal, harsh, but also heart-felt fashion.d a terrific job in not turning this into a sob story.

You'll see killings and bloodshed, but I was surprised to see the detail in which Goines describes how a family gets killed by a cat called the Creeper. You know he's successful in painting a picture and making you feel like you're right there watching it happen, and in this case, it got pretty bad. The story is short, but it leaves you wanting more and it worked, because I'm on my way to find Kenyatta's Escape right now.	2004-09-28

Goines brings Daddy Cool, a professional hit man, to the forefront. The thing is this is much more than a man out killing people. It's another example of him having a story within a story. His daughter runs away from home after a heated argument one night, and that is when the story really picks up. Now Cool has his job to do, which was stressful enough, and has to locate his daughter, as well as having problems at the house with his two stepsons, who know all too well what was going on without letting Daddy Cool know about it until it was too late. Another classic by a classic writer.	2004-09-27

You have to really pay attention, or you may get lost, because Goines has many characters doing all sorts of things during the story. There was a lot of hostility between the Blacks and Hispanics from the outset, and it escalated as the story moved forward. All in all, another piece by Goines which is off the hook.	2004-09-23

If you really take in the message Goines gets across, you'll see it's much more than a man complaining about this, that, the man not giving him a break, etc. Chester (the main character) was fully aware of his crimes and knew he would be punished. The severity, however, is what got to him, and really set the story in motion. The supporting cast Goines brings is terrific; later on in the story Chester and a friend of his befriend a white inmate, and while everything is cool between the three of them, you can see the tension mount when it's time for two of them to go to the parole board and see about their releases. A story this authentic and true can only be told by someone who's either lived it, or has been around it, and Goines more than qualified to do the job.	2004-09-21

Sandra (the main character) was lost from the moment we were introduced to her, but it wasn't her fault. It looked as if she wouldn't recover from the beginning until she found someone who was somewhat similiar to her. Throughout the story, Goines shows how their bond became stronger and it remained that way until the very end. She found someone who believed in her, and in return, gave him all she could all the way to the climax. Once again, he wrote a piece which was very realistic and brutally honest.	2004-09-19

I appreciated that she went and did her research before she wrote about something as sensitive about black men and our masculinity. She had a very tough, but thoughtful critique of why black men are suffering today. Some may not agree with her thoughts, possible solutions, and such, but for me, I'm definitely feelin' her. The only thing which did upset me was the amount of typos in the book, but that is due to poor editing and not the content of what hooks brought. Everyone, from black men to black women and on down has to come to the realization that some sort of self-analysis needs to be done in order to be completely whole. She's done it, and still does so. Kevin Powell (who she mentions in her book) wrote a series of essays which he admitted wrongdoings in the past, and he's on his way to self-discovery and self-fulfillment. I feel like I am on that same road they have traveled of finding myself, loving myself, being honest and true with myself first, and it has led to a certain type of freedom in me I had not experienced before. Once other brothers (and sisters) realize a lot of what she said is true and needs to be addressed, we will all be better off collectively.	2004-09-13

In this story, he took me there again. In the others I've read, I felt as if I was right there sitting down watching his characters do what they do in his stories. His style, use of words, and use of characters come to life in only ways he can make them. If you really pay attention to the story, there is a message which can be taken from each character, from Whoreson, to his mother Jessie, all the way down to Tony, his former best friend and many others.	2004-09-01

After reading this, I'm shocked it isn't given the respect it is surely due. He talks about various people, such as the contrast of styles between James Baldwin and Richard Wright, the assassination of Malcolm X and the aftermath it left from Folsom Prison(where he was serving time) as well as other places around the country, and an eye-opening examination between himself, two of his comrades, and another fellow prisoner, which was shocking and all too surreal to say the least. Like other books which has been previously written during that time, there is still major relevance for it in the 21st century.	2004-08-29

This story is considered fiction, but like it's been said many times about this guy, he writes from experiences he's had, and the only way a story can be told this well is through experience. Some of the things in this book will leave you more than surprised, startled, angered, saddened, and then some. Every character in this story has something behind them and he is able to bring it out in a way only he can. If there is one word to sum up this story by Goines, it's REALISTIC.	2004-08-18

It was good to read these stories of various black women and their experiences with love and relationships. It is not a book bashing men; it is a collection of heart-felt work from everyday women with vivid stories. I think if we as black men take the time to listen to our women, everything would be much better. Hopefully, sisters won't give up on all black men, because all of us are not knuckleheads even though it may seem like it. Ms. Smith also gave brothers an opportunity to write a few pieces which brings the book a tremendous balance. I recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and is willing to pay attention. I'll be looking out for anything else Ms. Smith puts out.	2004-08-13

This was the first book I've read from Goines, but it won't be the last. He had a way of making the story so vivid, so real; he had a way of just bringing it to life and putting you right in the middle of the action. His characters in this story(the main ones) all had their own traits, and Prince and Ruby surely were the mad couple if there ever was one. The thing most impressive about it to me was he tied in actual events along with his story. The riots in Detroit, along with Black nationalist issues were key then, and he tied all of it in with what he was bringing to the table.	2004-08-13

After reading this, I had to change my mind. This guy continues to take chances and step up his writing in ways other authors only wish they could. He tells this story through the eyes of Driver, an ex-con who is looking to move on with his life, but it is not that easy. He also has a top-notch supporting cast which helps bring this book to life. Dickey has given us plenty of stories which have brought out a variety of emotions and have been extremely thought-provoking, and this one is no different. Trust when I say you will not be disappointed.	2004-08-09

While I was reading it, I laughed, sighed, shook my head, smiled and many other feelings and words (some of which I cannot repeat) came out of me. For me, this was something I've seen for a while now. I'm happy I am not the only one who has felt these things and seen the things which were discussed in the book. It is not a pipe dream: the author, as well as the people she interviewed, don't give us a 1+1=2 solution to the condition of the corporate world for young Black Americans, because it would not be realistic. I would recommend this to any young Black American (or the old-school cats for that matter) who is looking to take that step to corporate America. It will open eyes for some and re-inforce existing ideas for others.	2004-08-02

This story really made me appreciate and admire what this man went through to become who he was. It told much more than how to get rich and stay rich. It spoke of his beginnings, his many obstacles in his path, and the ability to persevere in a time when it seemed impossible, especially in Birmingham, Alabama. It really put many things in perspective for me, and I hope other people get the honor of reading this timeless piece. I am a business major, so this was something I know I needed. The unfortunate (but not surprising one bit) thing is before this book, I had never heard of A.G. Gaston. In college, you hear about the Rockefellers, the Carnegie's, and others. I stumbled across this book when I was browsing around at the bookstore. Had it not been for that, I may have never known anything about this brillant man and the contributions he made in the Black community. I gained much more than I ever expected initially.	2004-07-31

I'm a die-hard basketball fan and an Iverson fan at that, so just about everything Mr. Platt covered on Iverson I already knew. He was able to have access to Iverson, which is always a positive thing, because you can get the story directly from the source. He talks about Iverson's childhood, his high school career, which has been well-documented, his time at the University of Georgetown, and his time in the NBA. He also takes the time to talk about other pivotal events in Iverson's life. All in all, I was satisfied, but I'll still have to wait for the autobiography to be fully blown away.	2004-07-29

I loved the fact there were black people, young black people, in that time who were collectively doing what they could for us to come up at that crucial period in the late '60s. I don't think the Panthers get the respect they deserve in terms of their part in the Civil Rights era. To some, they had a nonconventional way of getting their message across, but I admired their courage and their intelligence. Hilliard examines everyone who was a crucial part of the movement, including Kathleen and Eldridge Cleaver, Lil' Bobby Hutton, Bobby Seale, Geronimo Pratt, Huey Newton, and others. He also discusses his own personal demons and how it afflicted him as well as the party. All in all, it was a very good read for me and was much needed.	2004-07-29

The only way a book like this can be written the way it was is if you are a part of the culture yourself, because if not, it will not be easy to understand. I, for one, love it because he uses teams from the 80's, such as the Georgetown Hoyas, the early 90's with the Fab Five of the Michigan Wolverines, and other teams, players, and events in the game which took me back in time. When he speaks about these things, you can see the connection with hip-hop, such as Allen Iverson's influence, and others lack thereof. He uses lyrics from some of the hip-hop's greats, but like I mentioned before, you must be a part of the culture or at least familiar with it to see what he is trying to say. He keeps it real throughout the book and gives credit where it is due while being critical at the same time. 'Ball and hip-hop have a unique bond, and the significance of it cannot be ignored.	2004-07-28

For one, it was told in his words, so everything is authentic. The book really opened up my eyes to a lot of things, because its still painfully obvious that some of the struggles and some of the issues he talked about in the 50's and 60's still apply to this day. He spoke about his beginnings as a young child bouncing in and out of group homes, to his days as a hustler, to his conviction, and to his experiences with the Nation of Islam. You can't watch the movie and expect to get the whole story. As great as it was, you still need the book to get the entire gist of the work. Some may take offense; others will simply nod their heads in agreement, or simply shake in disbelief or maybe even sit down and really let what he was saying sink in. This is an incredible piece of work which should be read by EVERYONE. After reading this, and doing other research on this incredible man, I still think as much respect as he's been given, he is still underappreciated. I gained a new admiration for him through this piece.	2004-07-28

With this book, the author shows his versatility and why, in my opinion, should be mentioned among other terrific African-American authors. He tells the story once again from the streets of Philly, but this time, it is two families going at it, with the main characters being the young kids from each family. He does a tremendous job going from sequence to sequence, just like in Pipe Dream and the Bridge, and once you think you have the story figured out, there is another curveball he throws at the reader. He brings back Detective Lynch from the Bridge as one of the main characters in the pursuit for justice. You can tell the story is truly authentic, and its almost as if you can sit down in the story and watch as it goes along, like you would watch a great movie.
