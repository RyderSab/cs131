In his latest thriller, COMPANY MAN, author Joseph Finder redefines the genre and takes tension to a wholly thrilling new level.<br /><br />Morally-conflicted Nick Conover-a small fish in a big corporate pond-finds out that his carefully constructed life is beginning to show dangerous cracks.  Guilt over the brutal death of his wife in an auto accident haunts him.  As CEO of Stratton Corporation, he is forced to lay off half the workforce-most of the residents of the town he lives in, earning him the dubious nickname \\"Nick the Slasher\\"-shaming him.  When someone repeatedly breaks in to his expensive, gated-community home to spray paint \\"Nowhere to hide\\" on the walls, he fears for his teenage son and his daughter's lives.  Nick is certain, thanks to his Security Director, that the person terrorizing his family is a mentally ill former employee of Stratton.  It's when Nick shoots and kills the deranged man that his life takes on a nightmarish hue and everything he thought he knew is wrong.  Who can he trust?  Who are his friends?<br /><br />Finder takes the premise he introduced us to in \\"PARANOIA\\" and notches up the thrills until turning the page becomes a nearly unbearable delight!  Delving deep into the backstabbing and subterfuge inherent in corporate America, and giving us a character in Nick with whom we aren't sure we like at first, but who we come to root for by the final chapters, is the sign of a highly skilled writer.  And Finder has proven that he is the master at it time and again.  There are no other writers who can do what Finder can do...make me stay up all night reading!	2005-04-09

The Dark Magician Trilogy is a wonderfully told tale of a young street urchin, Sonea, who in a pall of anger at the treatment received by the Guild's Magicians, suddenly learns that her burgeoning powers are much stronger than those of the magicians'.  The Guild, rulers of the city and surrounding burroughs, are equally surprised, for never before has a slum-dweller been found to hold such power.  The search begins for Sonea, through the streets and underground of the slums, for it is forbidden for anyone to have powers without the Guild's permission and training.<br /><br />The Dark Magician Trilogy, is a cozy, well-told story with just enough tension to keep you reading, but with none of the annoying pomp and circumstance that some series fall prey to.  Highly recommended read!	2004-11-30

I just finished reading Lynne Truss's fantastic book, Eats, Shoots, and Leaves. While many of my writer friends have said they won't read it because \\"I don't need any more grammer and punctuation lessons, thank you very much,\\" it is NOT just a book on proper punctuation or grammar. It IS a humorous look at how the English language has evolved over the centuries, and the origins of some of our modern day punctuation. You may be surprised by the things you learn, as well as being thoroughly entertained by Ms. Truss's wonderfully acerbic wit. There's nothing like Brit-humour to get me snorting through my nose with laughter on the bus!	2004-11-24

You may remember him as Wesley Crusher from Star Trek: Next Generation.  I remember him more fondly as Gordie LaChance from Rob Reiner's brilliant coming-of-age film, \\"Stand By Me.\\"  Wheaton is all growed up now...and we're a better population because of it.<br /><br />\\"Just A Geek\\" made me laugh and it made me cry, but more importantly it inspired me to come out of \\"retirement\\" to post this review.<br /><br />I stumbled onto his web log a few months ago ([...]) and, as a writer, really admired his down-to-earth, real-person way of relating his world.  No ego-driven \\"look at me!\\" celebrity nonsense like some others I've read.  So when I learned of \\"Just A Geek\\" from his website, I went out and bought it.  It's easily the best purchase I've made in the past five years...and I rarely buy books.<br /><br />Wheaton relates his life and the struggles he faced post-Next-Generation, adding web log entries as a means to illustrate his point.  He comes across in his writing as the kind of guy you'd like to sit next to somewhere, chatting about this and that.  With deep emotion, genuine caring, and a voice that is all him, \\"Just A Geek\\" tops the list of memoir-style writing, right up there with Augusten Burroughs and David Sedaris.  I highly recommend this book!	2004-10-24

I am not easily impressed by high concept literature...but &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife&quot; blew my socks off!  Audrey Niffenegger's incredible tale of a man who suffers from &quot;Chrono Displacement Disorder,&quot; which means that he time travels randomly, following the path of his own life as it interconnects with the people in his life he's most deeply and emotionally attached to.  Niffenegger does an awesome job of ripping us from one place to another without losing the thread of her considerable tale...and in addition, throws in one of the most wonderful love stories of our time.<br />Prior to reading &quot;The Time Traveler's Wife,&quot; another love story held the #1 spot for me; Herman Raucher's &quot;There Should Have Been Castles.&quot;  Niffeneggers wonderful story easily usurps that position.

In reality, he merely gets through his days doing as little as he possibly can and still receive a paycheck.  That he's employed by Wyatt Telecom, a \\"player\\" amongst corporate giants only seems to bring out the rebellious side of him.  And so he seals his fate when he misappropriates funds for the retirement party of a lowly dock worker.  He's caught, as he knew he probably would be, though he lackadaisically tries to cover up his trail, and he finds out exactly how bad life can actually get.<br />When his employers opt not to arrest him for corporate fraud, among other things, Adam is relieved, but only temporarily.  Instead, they want to plant him as a spy in the upper echelon of their largest competitor, Trion Systems.  Not believing in his own talents, Adam at first balks at the idea-but he's left little choice.  Do it, or go to prison for the rest of his life.<br />All is not as it seems at Trion.  Adam finds that with the insider information he's fed by Wyatt, he's able to move smoothly up the corporate ladder, feeling a bit like James Bond.  He makes nearly three times as much money, is given a Porsche and a highly desirable condo in the poshest high-rise in the city, Adam begins to enjoy his double life.  That is until he begins to suspect that something isn't right.  Those he trusts show signs of being untrustworthy, and soon he feels trapped between two evils: himself, and Wyatt.<br />Publisher's Weekly has billed this as \\"the first blockbuster of 2004,\\" and Finder very well may live up to that hype.  With a tight storyline, incredible dramatic tension, well-developed characters, and more twists than a Chinese knot factory, \\"Paranoia\\" has already been added to my top ten all-time favorite reads, and should be on yours, as well!  Purchase two copies of this thriller, as you'll want one for home and one to carry with you wherever else you go.	2004-01-14

For fans of Dean Koontz, you'll recognize his signature story-telling style layered in with one of the freshest voices in any recent novel written.<br />Odd Thomas could be an everyman except for one thing:  he sees the dead everywhere around him.  They communicate with him--not in voice, but in gestures.  Odd has kept his predilection for seeing the dead mostly to himself.  Only a few around him know of this blessing/curse he's gifted with, and Odd would like to keep it that way.  That is until he uncovers the most insidious plot ever to endanger the small town of Pico Mundo.  The plot, ripped straight from newspaper headlines, has a nasty little twist to it which I won't give away here.  Needless to say, it's up to Odd, and Odd alone, to save his friends and the town...and he does so by putting himself in serious danger.<br />Koontz has thrilled readers over the years with his tales of the supernatural and various other oddities, but never has he captured a unique cast of characters as he has in &quot;Odd Thomas.&quot;  Like a Tim Burton film, he unravels the strange events in a manner that allows the reader to slowly buy in to them...and ultimately believe and root for a new hero: Odd Thomas.	2003-12-19

After reading a local review that simply raved about William Lashner, calling him the &quot;best mystery writer in the country,&quot; I knew I had to find one of his books and read it.  I was not disappointed.<br />Victor Carl, an attorney with two first names, isn't your ordinary, every day hero.  One might call him an anti-hero.  Consider that he's a lawyer, first off.  And that he's made some really bad decisions in his life, which has put him on the &quot;down and out&quot; list in Philadelphia.  In order to save his failing private practice, he agrees to aid Councilman Jimmy Moore to avoid a racketeering and murder rap.  Basically, he's sold his soul in order to get a leg up in the world.  Not only does his decision turn out to be the most dangerous choice he's ever made...it turns out to be the worst.<br />While Victor watches as his client is framed--and could it be that he's being duped as well?--he begins to learn a hard lesson about life, and about himself.<br />An excellent, well-written novel, with deeply flawed and believable characters, Lashner is one author that gets added to my &quot;favorites&quot; list!	2003-12-12

If one is caught still in the game after sunset, he is no longer in control of the game...rather, the game is in control of him.<br />So begins the terrors that face Nemo Raglan, a young man called home to Hawthorne after the brutal murder of his father. Though some of the suspicion falls upon Nemo's sister, who may or may not be losing her mind, the truth is far more bizarre, and is somehow linked to The Dark Game Nemo played as a child with his sister and brother.<br />Though I rarely read books in this genre, I came across its description on Amazon.com one day and was intrigued enough to buy it.  I was not disappointed!  Douglas Clegg manages to imbue his story with riveting suspense and mystery, while painting his characters well and believably.  Even Stephen King is a fan of this author's work--and you will be too!	2003-12-02

Clyde Phillips has been away for too long...but that has only served to sharpen his storytelling skills as evidenced in his latest thriller, &quot;Sacrifice.&quot;<br />Inspector-turned-Lieutenant Jane Candiotti returns in this snappy-paced thriller, and she's spunkier than ever!  Married to fellow officer Kenny Marks, the duo make a riveting team.  When billionaire philanthropist Phillip Iverson is murdered after pledging another generous financial gift to his own children's charity, it's up to Candiotti and Marks to put the pieces together.  But how many pieces are there?  Is the serial murders of local homeless men connected?  How does the not-so-grieving billionaire widow fit into it all?<br />With plenty of action, suspense, and enough red herrings to stock his own fish farm, Phillips delivers another ripping thriller to his eagerly-awaiting fans!

It spins a \\"what if\\" scenario about a government agency that wants badly to have access to all digital communications globally in order to \\"serve and protect.\\"  This big brother plot is interesting enough to hook the reader, but once inside the story, there are no characters with whom to sympathize.  Who are the bad guys and who are the good guys?  By the end of the novel I still had no clear idea of who the author was wanting me to like and who to hate, and that apathy made me ask why I'd bothered to read to the finish?  Perhaps that's why \\"Digital Fortress\\" didn't put the author on the map, but will become a sort of \\"backhanded\\" bestseller based on \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"	2003-11-14

Christopher John Francis Boone cannot stand to be touched.  He relates well to animals, though, like his pet rat, Toby, and his neighbor's dog, Wellington.  He can calculate complicated mathematical problems in his head for fun...and uses this device when he faces something he cannot comprehend--like emotions.  Christopher is autistic.  When Wellington is killed with a garden fork, Christopher cannot help but find the killer.  He turns to his favorite fictional character to help him &quot;detect&quot; the clues he'll need, even though he &quot;doesn't like Arthur Conan Doyle.&quot;  His sleuth-work gets him into all kinds of trouble, not only with the local constabulary, but his father and neighbors as well.<br />Mark Haddon, author of this wonderful book, brilliantly makes Christopher his narrator--a boy unable to fathom emotions but telling a highly emotional tale.  The voice is fresh, the story engaging, and the plot twists enough to wrench the reader's heart, no matter how cynical.  I strongly recommend this novel...and if you enjoy it, also try &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; by Jonathan Lethem.	2003-11-10

While she's very adept at creating scenes and scenery that resonates deeply, her characters leave something to be desired.  In &quot;Sunshine,&quot; the main character, nicknamed--what else?--Sunshine, has a tendency to disperse long, rambling, narratives that tend to lull the reader to sleep.  Somewhat stream-of-consciousness, the narratives don't serve to move the story forward very quickly, but are more like roadside distractions one sees along the way.  There is little action in this novel outside the main character's head, a difficult task even in the best of hands.  In &quot;Sunshine,&quot; the payoff was far too long in coming with little or no tension created beforehand to draw the reader along.  I loved McKinley's previous works, but don't count this one as one of her better ones.	2003-11-03

Too bad the story itself isn't half as good.  By page fifty, I kept wishing the narrator would meet a painful, bloody end.

Thus begins the trials of Josh Winkler, whose lackadaisical world is turned upside down when he accidently slips through a rip in time...but only travels fifteen minutes into his past.  The resulting fallout changes his world, and everyone around him.<br />Dickenson has written a wonderful romp of a tale that tweaked my imagination and made me think about the concept we know as time.  Though I thought that the protagonist, Josh, was a bit unlikable, the writing drew me forward, as did the story itself.  Though he's compared to the likes of Jonathan Carroll, I'd say Dickenson is a better storyteller.	2003-10-17

For this, he hires two local youths, brothers who are close enough in image and attitude they could be twins.  But all is not as it seems amongst the natives.<br />Demonstrating once again his prowess for taking a small community, injecting it with an external gay influence and making the results sing like a high-tension wire in a windstorm, Paul Russell does an excellent job in his newest novel, \\"War Against the Animals.\\"  Rich with metaphor and symbolism, \\"...Animals\\" is a subtle, poignant, and wonderful novel.

The plot is well-conceived and executed with enough adrenaline-churning moments to give the weak of spirit heart attacks.  Despite a few minor inconsistencies in detail, &quot;High Crimes&quot; layers the intrigue and suspense inescapably.  Finder does a phenomenal job of revving the tension to the right RPM to push this military/civilian thriller over the redline.  This novel was one of those page-turners we hope every book will turn out to be.	2003-10-04

While she's at times permissive and at others psychotic, Noah must navigate the waters of his adolescence without losing his own sanity, or losing his life.

While &quot;Still Life...&quot; wasn't a bad book--it kept my interest until the last scenes--it seemed to be too self-consciously written, self-referential, and tried too hard to be clever and funny, both of which it failed at.

What starts out as a very interesting premise devolves quickly into a battle between (almost) good and (almost) evil, though it doesn't even quite succeed at even that.  \\"The Silence In Heaven\\" begins with a number of angels being purged from heaven and forced to be earthbound.  Then it tells us that it was these angels who \\"created\\" vampires with their celestial blood.  Can you see what's coming?  Yes, the angels must battle the vampires for control of the world or mankind or something.  And there might be a love story (almost) involved, but since angels have no reproductive organs, it's more of a frottage* story, I would imagine.  Anyway, if you're looking for a summer read that doesn't involve a brain or any common sense, then by all means read this book.<br />*The act of rubbing against the body of another person, as in a crowd, to attain sexual gratification.	2003-05-11

It has a deeply imbedded moral, for one thing.  For another, it's beautifully written.  It assumes that magick is an everyday part of our lives in every way.  The moral part of this story deals with differences, and how each character handles or perceives themselves in light of such differences.  It's about relationships on many levels.  It's about changing who you think you are into who you ACTUALLY are.<br />All in all, Nina Kiriki Hoffman's novel, \\"A Fistful of Sky\\" is one of the most wonderful books I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time.

While it was entertaining and informative (though at times sounding like a how-to manual for hostage rescue), the story itself was only average.  Not having read any of Baldacci's previous novels in this genre, though I did read \\"Wish You Well,\\" which I loved, I would recommend his work.  The build-up in \\"Last Man Standing\\" was admirably executed, though the ultimate payoff seemed somehow disappointing.

While some have disparaged &quot;Peace Like A River&quot; for being unbelievable and tedious, I celebrate those very things--especially in a world where magic and miraculous happenings have been replaced by technology and television.  Leif Enger begins his fabulous novel by asking us to see the world through the eyes of his young narrator, Rueben Land, a child who is a miracle embodied.  He was stillborn, and brought to life by the words of his miracle-performing father.  From that moment on, Rueben's world has been filled with miracles--some of which only his eyes can see.<br />When his mentor and older brother, Davy, kills two men set on doing harm to the family, and then &quot;miraculously&quot; escapes jail, the Lands take off after him, pursued by an FBI agent bent on bringing Davy to justice.  The journey, and the wondrous things that happen along the way are the elements that make this an excellent novel.  Deep and symbolic (notice the family's name (Land, or earth); the blizzards that prevent passage (water and wind); and the places where the earth is rent in two by lignite (fire)), &quot;Peace Like A River&quot; shines in every way.  Forget the naysayers...this book is magic.	2003-02-05

If I had actually purchased this book instead of finding it on the shelf at my local library, I would've been angry at having wasted the cover price on &quot;The Eighth Day.&quot;<br />While the premise is excellent--nanotechnology as global takeover--it's mired in repetitive and uneven storytelling.  The ending is so contrived and ridiculous, I wondered if perhaps the authors had watched one too many Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis movies.  It wasn't a total waste of time, though, as I found myself drawn deeper and deeper into it, despite the sloppy and amateurish writing.  With better editing and some severe tightening up, &quot;The Eighth Day&quot; might've been a really good story.  As it is, I would recommend reading their first novel instead, or something else altogether.	2003-01-24

Though little new ground is covered, &quot;Goodnight, Nebraska&quot; is a wonderful novel, full of poetic language and deftly-turned phrases.  With echoes of Faulkner and Welty, McNeal has managed to evoke the last bastion of America, its hopes and broken dreams, and the beautiful rhythm that meanders throughout.  While the book jacket says that &quot;Goodnight, Nebraska&quot; is Randall Hunsacker's tale, in truth, Hunsacker is merely a rock dropped into a pond.  The resulting ripples spread ever outward, affecting everyone's lives in subtle and not-so-subtle ways.  This is one of those rare novels that begs a rainy day to be able to lose ones self within its pages.	2003-01-19

His brilliant style and voice--born from the gajillion books he's penned, certainly--draws one in immediately to the story without sacrificing character development or the element of mystery.  Set in his famous 87th Precinct, &quot;Fat Ollie's Book&quot; is another excellent notch in McBain's belt as fabulous storytelling.  His characters verbal sparring and jousting is unequaled in the mystery genre as their individual peculiarities speed the plot along to its surprising conclusion.

Hypothetically, this idea isn't that farfetched.  But when the scientists are found brutally tortured and murdered, the mystery begins!<br />The husband and wife team of Michael and Kathleen Gear write a believable and thrilling journey into the ethics of DNA replication, the moral quandary that comes with it, and manages to deliver a brilliantly written slam-bang novel that doesn't relent for any of its nearly 600 pages.  While obviously not fans of the \\"religious right\\", as the characters in the novel are fairly stereotypical, the Gears still thrill with \\"Raising Abel\\".  This one will make it onto my \\"best reads\\" list, for sure!	2003-01-04

While &quot;The Lost Boy&quot; brings up many ambitious ideas about the poor state of the earth's ecology, and sounds the doomsday horn about it, the story itself seems a bit too glossed over.<br />Robert Lieberman takes on the task of telling Molly and Danny Driscoll's tale, a woman and her five-year-old son.  When Danny mysteriously goes missing from his daycare centre one day, this sets the plot into motion.  But it's no ordinary &quot;missing child&quot; case.  As the author hints at things to come by building up the tension admirably, there are too many unbelievable reactions by the various characters to make this a better novel.  The eco-disaster motif is refreshing, especially the underlying message included in the story...but it doesn't really seem to play out in a way that holds ones interest until the end.  I kept thinking of &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot;, only with an end-of-the-world message while reading this.  While it was engaging enough, it wasn't a page-turner by any means.	2002-12-09

Augusten Burroughs' memoir about growing up in apparently the most dysfunctional place in the Universe, is brilliant, if somewhat surreal.<br />Burroughs relates his childhood with his mother, who may or may not be insane, and the cast of bizarre characters that inhabit his world. Like a strange episode of \\"The Twilight Zone\\", \\"Running With Scissors\\" is at once engaging and horrifying. I had to keep reminding myself throughout that it wasn't fiction, that Burroughs had actually experienced the drama as he told it. With a wry sense of humor that's prevalent all the way through, Burroughs manages to depict the horror of his life without slipping into maudlin self-pity. An excellent read...and I hope there's a sequel!	2002-12-02

While Lestat does make a \\"cameo\\" appearance in the excellent \\"Blackwood Farm\\", it's a far kinder, gentler Lestat than in previous novels.  It's almost as if Lestat has lost his 'fangs'.<br />\\"Blackwood Farm\\" is wholly Tarquin Blackwood's tale though, a hybrid of the Mayfair clan and neophyte blood hunter.  He tells the engaging story of his life at Blackwood Manor, with all of its interesting characters.  He hunts down Lestat for help when his \\"doppelganger\\" becomes too powerful and threatens his family and \\"un-life\\".  While Rice covers little new ground here in her combining of the Mayfair witch tales and her vampire legacies, her talent shines through tremendously.  Unfortunately, the narrative is uneven and choppy in places....but not enough so that the story is affected too much.<br />Rice knows her characters, her backstory, and how to build tension, which shows to great effect in \\"Blackwood Farm\\".  Even if you've become somehow jaded with recent novels from Rice, this would be an excellent time to renew your faith!	2002-11-29

Nancy Sparling rolls out the doormat in her novel \\"Being...Alexander\\"...and his name is Alex.  Alex Fairfax, to be exact.  Alex is a corporate cut-out doll, a pushover, a Mr. Milquetoast for the twenty-first century.  But unlike that legendary character, Alex gets pissed and decides not to take it anymore.  When he walks in on his nefarious and backstabbing boss having sex with his girlfriend, something in Alex snaps.  And thus is born Alexander.<br />Sparling does an excellent job of making Alex an unlikable git at the beginning of her novel, and an equally excellent job of making the reader root for him as he is born again...with great, giant balls.  His endeavor for revenge against all those who've walked over him is a wonderful exercise in revenge.  Sparling doesn't wimp out at the end either, by offering some overused and trite moral comeuppance...but allows the story to run its course naturally.  For that reason, \\"Being...Alexander\\" is a great story; entertaining and perfect for anyone who's been used as a doormat in their life.	2002-11-29

Husband and father Scott Gardner is jealous of his brother, who seems to have everything Scott doesn't.  Scott pushes his family to excel and succeed...but is hampered by the memory of his dead son, Adam.  Brandon Gardner, Scott's next-oldest son and still living, must survive with the pressure of Adam's ghost hovering over his world all the time.  Scott is certain that Adam would've grown up to become the perfect uber-son, had he not succumbed to leukemia at a relatively young age.  And now Brandon is beginning to show signs of failure.<br />Enter Julian Sawyer, an opportunistic man hired as tutor to Brandon Gardner.  Think Norman Bates here.

Stephen IS King.<br />&quot;From A Buick 8&quot; is far from a &quot;Christine&quot; knock-off.  More like a compilation of &quot;Tommyknockers&quot;, &quot;The Regulators&quot;, &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; with new elements of suspense thrown in.  All in all, it makes a horrifying and well-told story, done in brilliant King style.<br />No one draws characters like King does, and that amazing ability is shown to perfect advantage in &quot;...Buick 8&quot;.  Most of the story takes place on the grounds of a western Pennsylvania State Trooper department, where, in Shed B, rests an odd vehicle. One that pretends to be a Buick, but enough of its parts are just wrong enough to make it suspicious.  And when it begins spewing bizarre, monstrous and dangerous items from its trunk--the State Troopers have their hands full trying to determine the nature of this particular beast.<br />King allows his characters to tell the story, a task they undertake very well.  Offering slightly different viewpoints, but still a consistent and flowing narrative, this storytelling style works marvelously in this novel.<br />To King's credit, he does not offer easy answers to the events that take place, but leads the reader down many possible paths, allowing us to enjoy the story.  And to draw our own conclusions.<br />&quot;From A Buick 8&quot; is an excellent story, with all the expected King elements.  A frightening page-turner!	2002-10-30

While I haven't read a Koontz novel since &quot;Watchers&quot;, this came highly recommended to me by a family member...so I dove in.  I was not disappointed.<br />Like Stephen King, Dean Koontz draws his characters with exacting details, allowing the reader to believe in them, and to make an emotional investment.<br />Blending elements of science fiction, horror, and suspense, Koontz tells a gripping tale--with aliens, monsters of the human sort, and innocent-seeming heroes and heroines...all the classic elements of an excellent story.<br />The only real drawback I encountered in &quot;One Door Away From Heaven&quot; was a narrative ploy Koontz introduces late in the story...one that pulled me out of the story and confused me somewhat.  For the first two-thirds of his story, Koontz presents his story in the viewpoint of three of its main characters.  In order to avoid a narrative black-hole, we suddenly encounter the viewpoint of the story's protagonist, Preston Maddoc.  While I can see why it was necessary to do so, it was nonetheless jarring...and a problem that could've been remedied by introducing Maddoc's narrative earlier in the story.<br />But, Koontz is still tells a wicked-good story!	2002-10-30

It's immediately apparent that the pair's trajectories are following the same arc.  And for the reader, an excellent tension-builder, for we know that this is Beatrice's doomed soul mate.  Their lives together makes both of them more happy than they've ever been...and we know that a love like theirs happens rarely.  That's why we want that long-ago fortune teller to be wrong, for their love to prevail over all.<br />When a story is so well-written that it engages my emotions on an incredibly deep level, deep enough for me to get angry at Beatrice for being such a fool...I know the writer has me hooked.<br />Tiffanie DeBartolo does an excellent job of making her characters believable and complex, with tough choices that ultimately affect their lives in profound ways.  &quot;God Shaped Hole&quot; is one of those books that only comes along once a decade--but manages to remain in the hearts of anyone who is lucky enough to have read it.

The story is deep, dark, and delicious!  As a Wiccan practitioner, I found this arcane story to be an excellent read, except...and here I may be the only one who found this to be true...except for the annoying places where names and dates were left out.  While realizing this is a plot device designed to add mystery and intrigue to an already beguiling story, it only served to be repetitive and without seeming consistency.  I did not understand WHY certain names and dates were &quot;blanked out&quot;, and others were not.  By the time I'd finished the book, I was so irritated by this ploy, I closed the book in disgust.  The author might've concentrated more on telling his wonderful story than attempting to lure the reader in such a manner.  Hence the rating I've logged.	2002-09-24

Taking place over a year and in many locales, \\"Anything Goes\\" introduces us to Jesse, a disaffected and somewhat bitter young man traveling through his life as a member of a band called...you guessed it...Anything Goes. As a band name, the title [is bad].... But as a theme for the novel it works quite well.<br />Jesse, abandoned as a child by his mother and physically abused by his father, has become a man who doesn't expect good things from the world. As he matures throughout the pages of this book, he discovers himself in ways that are both subtle and poignant. This is a quiet story that stays with you long after you've read it...and I recommend giving it a read!	2002-09-14

While Iles's writing is tight and his stories move along with a quick pace, &quot;Sleep No More&quot; loses its pace somewhere in the third chapter and never quite regains its footing.<br />&quot;Sleep No More&quot; has the feel of having been written prior to Iles's other books, having a more amateur-ish style instead of the excellent previous books.  While this particular novel is still far better than many novels in the genre, it's not one of the author's personal best.  Still worth reading!	2002-09-04

Although<br />the story is exceptional and the premise is refreshing and bold, the plot dwindles away like the memory of the main character.<br />Telling the story of the late fourteen-year-old Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\"--and why the author chose this name is one of the mysteries of this novel)who was recently murdered, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" presents a fresh voice in contemporary literature. We see the entire story from Susie's vantage point in her heaven, a plot device that is at once brilliant and daunting. As we watch the devastation that Susie's unsolved murder wreaks on her family and the community in which she lived, the reader is treated to a multi-viewpoint narrative...a treat in itself. Susie is able to hear the thoughts and see the actions of every character in the book, including those of her murderer.<br />That there is no real retribution in the story of the man who brought down his murderous wrath on Susie and numerous others, is a point that sticks in my mind as one of the weaker plot issues.<br />Reading \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was a joy, and I recommend this to everyone looking for an interesting novel from a different perspective on life.	2002-08-24

Alton Gasky enters an arena once held by none other than the ubiquitous Frank Peretti with his novel &quot;The Prodigy&quot;. While Gasky covers no new ground with this well told tale, he does do it with passion, verve, and a deft hand. While I tend to shy away from any books with a religious theme, &quot;The Prodigy&quot; is a fabulous exception to my typically steadfast rule. Handling the story of six-year-old Toby, a backwoods-born, illegitimate son of an uneducated mother and abusive father with capable hands, Gasky entertains with the best of them. Though the story itself has gaping holes in the plot, and some of the events take a tremendous leap of belief for the reader, &quot;The Prodigy&quot; is still an entertaining read. Also, some of the questions posed are left unanswered in this tale...questions of faith and plausibility. Still, I would recommend this novel for anyone wanting a quick, easy, non-thinking read for a summer day~	2002-07-25

Or take her to a field, push her out of the still-moving car, and leave her there.<br />In Miriam Taylor, Nicole Stansbury has created a kinder, gentler \\"Mommie Dearest\\"...as told by the youngest daughter, Lucy.  In Lucy, we find an enabler in the making, forgiving her dysfunctional mother time and again, no matter how destructive her mother is to the family, and especially to Lucy.  And it seems, in \\"Places To Look For A Mother\\" that nobody really loves Lucy.<br />There were times in this novel that I wished I could reach deep into the pages and shake some sense into Lucy, tell her to get out before Miriam's insidious poison seeped into her heart, never to be dispelled.  Reading \\"Places...\\" brought up many of my own \\"mother issues\\", and it was an anxiety-ridden read from beginning to end.  (my own mother makes Miriam look like Mother Theresa...though there were many issues in this novel that rang totally true from my viewpoint)<br />I gave this book only 3 stars, not because of the story or the wonderful writing (albeit a bit disjointed in places).  This rating is for the very poor proofreading and editing job that was performed before the book was released.  Many deleted words, repeated words, words with too many letters or not enough...very irritating overall.  Each one was like a tiny little speedbump on the page that slowed the story down.  Otherwise, great read!	2002-07-20

Into a world of instant gratification and quick sitcom/mini-drama type resolution comes a fabulous new novel by Stephen Carter.<br />Judge Oliver Garland, a feared, respected, and misunderstood man, is dead of an alleged heart attack. As his family, friends, former colleagues and other assorted denizens gather together to pay last respects (or at least plot underhanded political manuevers), the reader begins to suspect that not all is as it seems. Enter Talcott Garland, second eldest son of \\"The Judge\\", and the one riddled with the most self-doubt and angst. His father's death has created a vacuum in Tal's world that is quickly filled with conspiracies and danger.<br />Carter takes his own, sweet time unraveling his story, much to the benefit of the reader, introducing paranoid plots and many red-herrings along the way. At first I found the lengthy read daunting, but settled into the lyrical language and ever-deepening plot comfortably. It's refreshing to find an author who takes his time to unravel his story rather than rushing through. By the end of \\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\\", I felt I knew all of the characters very well...a rare find in many modern reads. In fact, reading \\"The Emperor...\\" was like enjoying a fine meal prepared by a skilled chef, delicious and hugely satisfying.<br />I heartily recommend buying this book, cancelling all of your appointments, unplugging the phone, and digging in!	2002-07-16

Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed.<br />While Grimsley has perfected his character development in previous books, and has that whole southern storyteller thing down, I found &quot;Boulevard&quot; to be confusing and meandering.  While the initial 100 pages are Grimsley at his best (drawing a deep and complex character in Newell), the introduction of the subsequent characters was distracting.  By the time I got to page 200, I no longer cared what happened to Newell, or his innocence...or especially his newfound and somewhat sociopathic boyfriend.<br />I would recommend any of Grimsley's previous works before touting this one.	2002-06-27

Being a first-time reader of Rodman Philbrick's work, I found \\"The Last Book...\\" to be brilliantly original and fresh.  The story is exciting, and the realization of a near-future Earth is fabulous and haunting.  For this book, Philbrick has created his own future jargon, adding a spicy element to the story not found in too many other YA novels.<br />In \\"The Last Book...\\", the plotline might seem familiar, but the unlikely hero's journey has never been depicted quite so cleverly.  \\"Spaz\\", a teen epilectic, lives in a world in which social decay is the norm...cities crumbled or destroyed, roving bands of rebels taking the place of law enforcement, and technology the downfall of all.  Imagining such a gloomy, and perhaps prophetic world seems such an easy task in the deft hands of Philbrick.  I see that many younger readers enjoyed this highly entertaining page-turner...but as an avid reader of YA novels, I found this to be a fantastic read!	2002-06-21

In the town of Steepleton, it appears that tolerance of others is low on the list of virtues, with the town being drawn into separatism based on where one lives.  When resident geek Christopher Creed mysteriously disappears, leaving behind an equally mysterious note, what ensues is an engrossing ghost story, bordering on mysticism, with a hefty dose of morality thrown in.<br />Carol Plum-Ucci has a wonderful way with words, though some of her attempts at capturing the jargon of the day falls a bit flat in places, sounding contrived and trite.  But that is certainly overpowered by the story itself.  I recommend this story as an excellent mystery with no easy answers, and an unflinching look at life in a small town...warts and all.	2002-06-06

This worthy sequel to &quot;...Planet&quot; begins only a week after the action of the first.  The characters already established, as is the plot, &quot;...Moon&quot; is a continuation of the wonderful story.<br />&quot;Chigger&quot; and his two brothers are still fleeing from many people, including their parents, while unknowingly toting a stuffed robotic animal endowed with super-intelligence.  While this super-intelligence is only in its test phases, a few units have &quot;escaped&quot; and are loose in the solar system.  &quot;Chigger&quot; finds out that his little brothers stuffed monkey is actually a sentient being on the lam from many nations who would control it. Most of the action takes place on the cold, sterile and anonymous surface and sub-surface of Earth's Moon, which has been colonized by the &quot;Loonies&quot;, a nickname for lunar inhabitants.  Gerrold does an apt job of bringing the action forward (although the story itself nearly mimics the first novel in story arc) and keeping the reader interested in the outcome, which has a somewhat surprising twist.<br />As far as young adult fare goes, this one is a winner!	2002-06-06

In her newest novel, \\"Walter's Purple Heart\\", she cements her domination as an incredible storyteller and translator of the language of undying love.<br />\\"Walter's Purple Heart\\", a symbol for the love one man holds as a bright, shining beacon of hope, even after his own death, presents the reader with an interesting premise.  Not unlike \\"Ghost\\", and reminiscent of \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" in tone and flavor (only much, much better written), \\"Walter's Purple Heart\\" resonates with poetry and brilliance.<br />Walter is killed in Guadalcanal in 1942, but his soul is restless.  It seems that he cannot \\"cross over\\" and leave his love unspoken for Mary Ann...nor his death a mystery for his best friend Andrew. He enlists the (at first) unwilling aid of Michael, a somewhat paranoid marijuana farmer in California (what other kinds are there?).  By giving Michael bizarre dreams of his horrific and untimely death, Walter draws Michael into his reasons for returning, and urges him (or perhaps threatens him is more apt) to find his childhood sweetheart and his former best friend.<br />\\"How will I know what to do once I find them?\\" Michael asks.<br />\\"You'll know,\\" Walter assures him.<br />Nothing is ever quite that simple.  While Mary Ann recognizes Walter in Michael's eyes, and their decades-old relationship sparks anew (despite the glaring difference in age), Andrew is reluctant and bitter, refusing to believe that Walter has returned in the unlikely form of Michael.<br />With unerring brilliance, Hyde again displays her ability to make a phrase sing with wonder and beauty, drawing the reader in flawlessly and effortlessly.  By presenting Walter's appearance in the story in a no-nonsense fashion, Hyde thereby avoids the \\"suspension of belief\\" issue of dealing with her narrator being a ghost, the sign of a great writer.<br />\\"Walter's Purple Heart\\" proves that Hyde is an author to be reckoned with, her storytelling capabilities destined to become legend, if they're not already!he sign of a great writer.<br />\\"Walter's Purple Heart\\" proves that Hyde is an author to be reckoned with, her storytelling capabilities destined to become legend, if they're not already!	2002-05-24

In the years I've been reading the Alex Delaware series, it seems that the author peaked at book two, and continued his downward descent ever since.  Though there have been some incredible highlights here and there, for the most part I don't buy the hype that is Kellerman's media marketing.<br />In \\"Flesh and Blood\\", I found myself trudging through the emotionally devoid writing, trying hard to find something likable about the paper cutout characters and weak storytelling...to no avail.  It appeared that somewhere along the line, Kellerman lost his passion for writing, and continues to do so only to meet his contract requirements with the publisher, or else compete with his wife, novelist Faye Kellerman.  It's as if Kellerman, himself a psychologist, writes an analytical report of what a book SHOULD look like, then tweaks a few areas and submits the results as a novel.  I find it impossible to care about his relationship with Robin, who would be better off hooking up with gay Detective Milo Sturgis.  At least there she'd find something akin to the passion that Delaware/Kellerman sorely lack.  The plots have become replications of every other plot in the series, with no new twists or turns...perhaps Kellerman is banking on familiarity, and therefore afraid to break new ground with new material.<br />For the first time, I count myself as not one of an author's avid fans, but a strong dissenter.  My suggestion would be for Kellerman to try writing something else, or give up altogether.	2002-05-08

All the brilliant things we might have done with our lives if only we suspected we knew how.\\"<br />Although this simple sentence appears near the end of Ann Patchett's beautiful and brilliant \\"Bel Canto\\", it aptly sums up the whole of this excellent story.<br />With the daunting task of setting the entire story in the sometimes-home of a South American Vice President, Patchett breathes wonderful life into a cast of characters put into unusual and tense surroundings.  When the birthday celebration of a Japanese businessman becomes the hostile battleground for a group of renegade terrorists, the party's attendees become the unwilling cast which Patchett moves deftly through their paces.  Although the claustrophobic setting of this story would seem off-putting, Patchett takes this chance to explore the endless possibilities of the human heart within the strict confines of its captive surroundings, giving her novel the illusion of breathtaking expansiveness and of being totally boundless.<br />This is one of those rare books which one is loathe to put down, yet reluctant to read quickly, for the pure joy of reading the poetically written emotions and perfectly worded sentences.  I found that I could only read one page per sitting, so badly did I want to savor it's exquisite flavors.  Count me in as a new advocate of Ann Patchett!	2002-04-03

Though perhaps \\"life\\" is the wrong word to use.<br /> Hollywood in the 1920's and `30's was a glamorous world filled with the classy silver screen stars that helped put the movie capitol of the world on the map.  What the world rarely saw or heard of was the seamier underbelly of that same glitzy lifestyle, the sexual peccadillos and perversions of some of Hollywood's brightest stars.  Barker delves deep into this depravity, and weaves one helluva ghost story to boot.<br /> Todd Pickett is the fictional main character, an A-list hunk on the level of Cruise, Pitt, or Gibson.  It's not that he's a great actor, or that he stars in great films.  But he was blessed with the genetic attributes that causes a whole nation to swoon over his every expression. But, in Hollywood, age can be anathema to any beautiful face, and so it goes with Pickett.  Under the ill-advisement of a wunderkind producer, Pickett decides to \\"go under the knife\\" of one the that city's best reconstructive and cosmetic surgeons.  Of course, the surgery somehow goes horribly wrong, permanently disfiguring Pickett's face.<br /> In an effort to avoid the press frenzy sure to follow such a fantastic story, Pickett retreats to an old mansion hidden deep in the hills above Sunset Blvd., a mansion thought to be deserted.  What Pickett finds out, in the worst way possible, is that its not deserted at all, but filled with the souls of the Who's Who of Hollywood past, trapped there by a piece of  art transported from Romania by a man obsessed with his wife, the great screen star Katya Lupia.<br /> The story is filled with the names and faces that made Hollywood what it is today, but in ways that are tittilating and fantastic.  With his usual panache and deft scene structure, Barker creates a thrilling story, well worth the read!<br /> Be forewarned, this book contains very sexually explicit scenes...with ghosts.d!  <BR> Be forewarned, this book contains very sexually explicit scenes...with ghosts.	2002-01-12

However, due to some editing and continuity flaws, this story falls short of being nearly perfect.<br />Matson breathes life into all of her characters in a manner similar to Catherine Ryan Hyde (Pay It Forward, Electric God),  but without the dramatic emotional insight that would bring them up out of the story and into emotional realism.  While I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;A Trick of Nature&quot;, it left me feeling somehow cheated, like something was being held back from me...some vital and important piece I wasn't privileged to.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book for those searching for a good diversion from reality for awhile.	2001-12-05

So blown away was I by the first novel of his that I read, &quot;24 Hours&quot;, that I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I was not disappointed.<br />Jordan Glass, a female photojournalist heralded for her breathtaking work in the same vein as her late father, is deeply troubled by life.  Her father disappeared and was presumed dead during one of his Pulitzer-winning photo jaunts, and her identical twin sister disappeared as well without a trace.  While travelling in Hong Kong, Jordan comes upon an art exhibit in which she sees a disturbing image...herself, dead.  Or so she presumes.  Perhaps it's her sister's image, she's not sure.<br />The ensuing mystery grabs you by the adrenal gland and doesn't let go until the final climactic scene.  Again, Isles does a tremendous job of moving his story forward at breakneck speed, keeping his characters believable and his plot tight.  Count me in as a Greg Isles convert!	2001-11-09

While Kalogridis gives us excellent visuals and brilliant plotlines, the 'flowus interruptis' is distracting and annoying.

I pity the poor shades confined to the Euclidean prison which is sanity.&quot;  Dr. Amedeus Arkham<br />  'Batman:Arkham Asylum'<br />David Czuchlewski's debut novel, &quot;The Muse Asylum&quot;, is a brilliantly wrought story about the mysterious paths our lives take, bringing us into contact with people for strange reasons...reasons which ultimately are revealed to us, for better or for worse.<br />At the center of this story is Lara Knowles, a young woman loved by two men:  Jake Burnett, a reporter dedicated to revealing the identity of the reclusive and highly revered American author Horace Jacob Little; and Andrew Wallace, a very disturbed genius and inmate of the Overlook Psychiatric Institute for artists.  Andrew is convinced that Little is trying to kill him.  Because of Lara and Little, the three characters paths converge and cross many times, stoking the plot nicely.<br />With twists and turns abounding, &quot;...Asylum&quot; is an incredible and entertaining read, mysterious and intelligent.  I applaud Mr. Czuchlewski's insight and talent!	2001-10-05

Stephen King and Peter Straub, both incredible writers in their own right, have re-formed the Dynamic Duo to bring us &quot;Black House&quot;...the title a reference to &quot;Bleak House&quot; by Charles Dickens (and the story itself done in a daring narrative style all its own, like Dickens's story)...a sequel to bestelling book &quot;The Talisman&quot;.  While Dickens story is an assault on the British Court System, showing the interconnectedness of all levels of society--from Lord and Lady Deadlock to orphaned Esther Sommerson to Jo the street-sweeper--so do King and Straub show the interconnectedness of all levels of existence.  And of course, they all rotate around and are hinged upon the Dark Tower, of King's previous series.  References to King's earlier works is only one of the many pleasures of devouring this newest effort.<br />Not without it's gruesome moments ala King and Straub, &quot;Black House&quot; delivers on many other levels as well.  Introducing a cast of equally memorable characters (on this level of existence), such as Henry Leyden, the blind disc-jockey, &quot;Black House&quot; is a hellraising, incredible feat, and should be read by everyone...immediately.	2001-09-28

Taking a viable scientific premise, implanted/recovered memory, and giving it a nasty twist, they create an incredibly promising start to a novel that spins its wheels and goes absolutely nowhere. And unfortunately, it takes a long time to get there. The characters are one-dimensional, and the way in which the story revolves around them seems lifeless, without any passion whatsoever. I had a very hard time caring about anything that happened to them, and wished they would just shut up and go away. Better luck next time!	2001-09-21

Colorado's Connie Willis has set out to do what many people have devoted their entire lives to: answer questions about life after death. The hotly debated topic has stymied scholors, religious leaders and the like down through the ages. Willis's latest novel, &quot;Passage&quot;, takes this issue by the thorny horns and wrestles it admirably, and somehow managing to tie in the Titanic at the same time.<br />Dr. Joanne Lander is an M.D. in the fictional hospital of Mercy General in Denver. She is fascinated by patients who have allegedly 'crossed to the other side', and come back to the land of the living. By interviewing them extensively, she is trying to understand the phenomena called Near Death Experience. Working with her (or against her, if you were to ask her) is Dr. Mandrake...somewhat of a charlatan in that he is more interested in the notoriety his own take on the issue brings than finding any real answers.<br />In a plot move reminiscent of the movie &quot;Flatliners&quot; (which Willis also deftly refers to here), Dr. Lander becomes a subject in a NDE experiment being conducted by the handsome, if somewhat tunnel-visioned, (pun intended) Dr. Wright. The experiment sets into motion a chain of incredible insights and events that take the characters on a wild ride to the other side.<br />Taking the time to develop the story and the characters, Willis imbues Lander and Mandrake and the numerous other characters in &quot;Passage&quot; with believable traits and actions. The pace is languid at times and riveting at others. I was highly entertained by this great adventure, and guarantee that you will be too! (note to author: one cannot turn west onto 6th Avenue from Colorado Blvd. It's one way headed east. :-) )	2001-09-13

She takes on a babysitting job for Jolly, a woman not much older that LaVaughn, but who is saddled with two kids already. With no prospects for the future....even less so because she's just gotten fired from her job because her boss thought that &quot;low-income&quot; means &quot;easy&quot;, Jolly cannot pay LaVaughn.  LaVaughn, though, is already attached to Jolly's two kids...and the drama unfolds.<br />Told in a realistic and visionary voice, &quot;Make Lemonade&quot; is an incredible tale of standing up for what you believe in and not wavering in the face of self-doubt or the doubt of others.  LaVaughn perseveres and grows because of it, as do all of the central characters in Virginia Euwer Wolff's first of a trilogy story geared toward young adults.  Recommended.	2001-09-04

Now a much calmer adult, he oversees that town's police force as chief. Having made peace with the demon's of his youth, Frannie has settled into a pleasant, if somewhat uneventful, life in Crane's View. That is until he befriends a three-legged dog, which summarily drops dead in his office one day. Taking it upon himself to bury the poor thing, it starts into action a chain of events that changes Frannie's life, and death, forever. Drawing on &quot;magical realism&quot; to tell his story, Jonathan Carroll weaves a brilliant premise of gods, aliens, and strange, colorful feathers which seem to keep cropping up whenever things are about to get really hinky in Frannie's world. The story is engrossing throughout it's many plot twists and turns, but seems somehow to take far too long to get to its point.  By the end of this story, I found myself skimming over the last pages to find the answers, not really caring about the droning particulars of the story any longer. Written with a wry nod to Neil Gaiman, &quot;The Wooden Sea&quot; starts out with a bang, and ends with the whimper of a three-legged dog named Old Vertue.	2001-08-24

When one thinks of wolves, several connotations come immediately to mind.  First, of course, is the literal form, the pack-running animals humans tend to fear and misunderstand.  Another might be a more oblique definition, used more in business dealings...and then there's always the everyday dealings we come across in our lives.  Michael C. White has utilized all of these references in his wonderful new novel, &quot;A Dream Of Wolves&quot;.  With incredible nuance, style, and emotional depth, White submerges the reader into the small-town lives of the people of Hubbard County, North Carolina, snug in the hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Seen through Doc's eyes, we witness the trials and tribulations that seem magnified in a town of such size. &quot;Doc&quot;, a &quot;yank&quot; from Maine, is the towns only OB/GYN and practicing medical examiner, a chore he'd much sooner be rid of, since he's getting on in years, and feels that his plate is already too full.  Even after thirteen years, he's reeling from the sudden disappearance and death of his only son, Will, and the subsequent deterioration of his wife's mental state...she, who disappears for months on end, only to return without warning to disrupt &quot;Doc's&quot; life.  When a local Native American woman is accused of killing her backwoods boyfriend under mysterious (at least to Doc) circumstances, the story revves into gear.<br />White depicts a multi-layered community, rife with tensions, racial and otherwise.  The characters act and react in a real manner, and become people you'll care about and want to know more of.  Excellent storytelling from an incredible author!	2001-08-13

Returning former-attorney Tom McInnes is back dodging bullets and bad guys, even though he insists he's &quot;only an attorney&quot;.  It seems that trouble just seems to find him no matter what...which would be to the benefit of everyone's entertainment if only &quot;Dog Island&quot; were as good as the first.  The characters felt somehow less vibrant this time around, and didn't bring about the empathy or interest the author was aiming for.  With too many predictable twists and turns, Stewart's writing feels as bogged down as the swamplands in which this second effort takes place.<br />Basing this story on the witness of a grisly murder by a teenage runaway, Stewart continues the characterizations he introduced in &quot;Sins of the Brother&quot;, though by mid-story, one hopes that they all meet untimely deaths, or at least decide to move to another state.  While confusing multiple identities with plotline, &quot;Dog Island&quot; becomes only repetitive and dreary by the exceptional &quot;seen-it-coming&quot; ending.  One would hope that this slump is only temporary, for the promise that &quot;Sins...&quot; showed us says that Stewart is very talented.  Let's hope he's not a one-hit wonder!	2001-08-07

The lead protagonist in this beautifully crafted novel is saddled with the unfortunate name of The Tao Jones...and as if that isn't bad enough, he is a racial mix.  That in itself is not the problem, unless one lives in the backward-thinking town of Cutter, Washington.  Being equal parts Black, Japanese and White puts T.J. (as he's known to everyone) in the crosshairs of every racially bigoted neanderthal in town, and in his high school.  It's no wonder then that he eschews organized anything, since he's been rejected pretty much all of his life. It's a classic case of reject first before he's rejected.  Naturally athletically gifted, he is courted by every coach in school, to no avail...until...he's approached about starting a swim team in a school without a pool.  Seeing an opportunity to flaunt a town's bigotry back in its face, T.J. accepts, and proceeds to put together the most motley crew of rejects he can find.  Never once losing his sense of vengeance, the swim team goes on to take its members and the school to new heights.<br />While presenting tolerance and intolerance in an objective light, Chris Cutcher manages to create a poignant atmosphere that is at once uplifting and bittersweet.  His main characters unwavering goals and ultimate perseverance is beautifully rendered, while managing to not alienate anyone who might read this book.  Highly recommended for adults as well as young adults, &quot;Whale Talk&quot; goes on my list of best reads of 2001.	2001-08-04

If it were possible to write a book using a stick of high caliber explosive as a pen, Greg Iles would be the one to do it.  &quot;24 Hours&quot; is quick-paced, yet loses no amount of character or plot development because of it.  With exactly the right number of twists and hooks, the reader is drawn right into the middle of the action and not released until the hostages are!<br />The Jennings are a model family: Will is a much sought-after anesthesiologist, while his wife Karen is a discontent housewife who was forced to put her own promising medical career on hold when she became pregnant.  Little Abby is the result, precocious and suffering from severe juvenile diabetes, a plot point that comes up again and again throughout the story. While Will is away at a medical conference, Abby is kidnapped by another type of family that falls somewhere on the opposite end of the scale from the Jennings.  The resulting nightmare is brilliantly told thriller that holds ones attention like it was stapled to the page!  With a series of double-crosses and unexpected plot twists, the story roars along to an intelligent conclusion.<br />This being my first reading of any of Iles books, I will definitely seek out his others as soon as possible!	2001-07-30

Though &quot;Night Sins&quot; is an earlier book than the other two mentioned, it still displays her considerable talents as a storyteller, weaving intense emotional backdrops which she sets her dramatic thrillers against.  Creating fully believable events that affect her credibly drawn cast of characters, Hoag delivers thrillers that continue to amaze by covering new territory on each outing, and bringing to life the people of the frozen north...Minnesota to be exact.  Setting most of her stories in such a forbidding meteorological place, bringing out in bas relief the events that transpire, giving each story a moody and tense atmosphere. I was hooked after reading only one of Hoag's finely written thrillers...and now I can't seem to stop reading them!	2001-07-22

Rozan's latest book, &quot;Stone Quarry, I expected a lot from it.  What I found though was somewhat entertaining, not at all informative, and wholly average.<br />Bill Smith, private detective, and his on-again/off-again partner, Lydia Chin, are the stars of this current installment of an ongoing series.  While vacationing in his deceased uncle's cabin in upstate New York, Smith becomes engaged in a what appears on the surface to be a simple burglary involving a reclusive artist who wants to remain anonymous but still recover some valuable paintings that were stolen from her.  The situation devolves quickly into a fight to the death with local crooks who may-or-may-not have mob ties, along with some bought-off cops on the local force.<br />While Rozan does an able job with telling this story, it follows a well-trodden path and ends in a place we've all been many times before. By the end of the story, I found myself being able to skip ahead without missing anything, which to me, says a lot about a book. While it appears that Rozan may have a huge following, she didn't gain a new one with me.	2001-07-14

Secrets buried deep beneath the shiny veneer of a model family have a way of working their way to the surface to the utmost detriment of the family structure.  Such is the case with Eliza Naumann's family.  Eliza, a largely indifferent young girl, barely skims through her life, when suddenly she's thrust almost unwillingly into the spotlight of the world via her adept spelling skills.  Her quick rise to &quot;stardom&quot; sets into motion a series of events that have repercussions for her brother Aaron, her doting father Saul, and most of all, her mother, Merriam.  And caught in the middle is Eliza, innocent and unable to do anything to save the crumbling structure of her family.  As we experience each member's innermost dialogue, we sit haplessly by and watch as they all fly off in different directions, not necessarily to the benefit of their well-being.<br />Using symbolism and sensitivity, Myla Goldberg depicts the effects of life on a family foundation built on modern-day faultlines.  Deeply moving and poetic, &quot;Bee Season&quot; brings about an emotional reaction felt clear to the core of one's soul.	2001-07-07

At times ironic and at others banal, &quot;Rides of the Midway&quot; is well-written enough to hold your interest, but that's about as much as can be said for it.<br />Telling the story of Noel Witherspoon, aka &quot;Spoon&quot;, aka &quot;Wasted&quot;...Durkee's novel spins out a fantastical tale of cynical youth caught up in the maelstrom of small-town life, fighting boredom and apathy while seeking escape in whatever chemical is trendy at the time.  When a series of somewhat bizarre circumstances brings the story to it's climax, the reader is already disinterested and ready to move on.  At times hallucinogenic, &quot;Rides...&quot; is a jumpy, jittery, yet languid story that covers no new ground, but is a good distraction nonetheless.	2001-06-29

Upon being awakened in strange surroundings, he is confronted by the oddest pair of wealthy kids he could ever imagine.  Jamalee and her stunning beauty of a brother Jason have him duct-taped to the very chair in which he fell asleep, and are interrogating him to determine if he is &quot;dangerous enough&quot; for their plans.<br />This is the incredible premise which opens &quot;Tomato Red&quot;, and immediately the reader is sucked into the vortex of these lives.  When Sammy discovers that the pair aren't in fact residents of the house he's broken into, but two kids from his side of the tracks, literally, who have also broken in to &quot;practice bein' rich&quot;, since Jamalee is positive that was the life they were destined for, it all riding on her brother's looks.  But every one of their thoughts are severely flawed...and the story takes a hellish ride through the subsequent landscape in which they are imprisoned.<br />Daniel Woodrell writes with an uncanny ear for dialect and a poetic way of depicting such regional wastelands.  &quot;Tomato Red&quot; is one of those books which never rested far from hand.  With razor sharp wit and unerring ability to write without pulling any punches, Woodrell gives us a classic downgrading of &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;, done with panache and humor.	2001-06-20

Pelacanos last thriller, &quot;Shame the Devil&quot; (five stars, &quot;A SHOTGUN BLAST OF A NOVEL!&quot;, review by Christian M. Lyons, Sept. 19, 2000), I expected another slam-bang nailbiter.  I wasn't disappointed with &quot;Right As Rain&quot;, Pelacanos' latest offering.  This time around, he presents it in a much more understated and subtle style.  This technique helps build the tension in increments instead of the in-your-face style of the previous book.  Still written with the panache and knowledge of all of his previous work, Pelacanos delivers another excellent read!<br />Former policeman-turned-private-investigator Derek Strange is happy with his world outside the police force.  His business is doing well, and he thinks he might be in love with his assistant, Janine, though he's unwilling to make that necessary step and commit to her outside of their frequent sleepovers.  When the mother of a recently murdered policeman hires Strange to find out the truth about her son's death, he slowly but inevitably he gets drawn in deeper and deeper to a massive coverup...putting his own life in danger.  With a believable cast, &quot;Right As Rain&quot; sings like a high-tension wire in a thunderstorm, building to an incredible climax that kept me hooked until the very last word.  I recommend reading this immediately, then running out and buying the others from the brilliant brain of George P. Pelacanos!	2001-06-07

Never has a book inspired so many conflicting emotions within me as &quot;Nearer Than The Sky&quot;.  T. Greenwood, author of &quot;Breathing Water&quot;, has penned an incredibly nuanced story of a family beset by an insidious and dangerous mental illness: Munchausen Syndrome by proxy. This relatively unknown illness goes unreported in so many cases, mostly because it's almost impossible to detect (especially in it's subtler forms), and is hard to prove in a court of law.  But it's very real...as real as your baby's next breath.<br />This is the story of Indie Brown, a woman who wishes that her childhood had never happened.  But in the way of all life, nothing is ever completely over and done with.  Happily settled into adulthood with her loving and steadfast husband, Peter, Indie begins to be drawn ever so slowly backward into her past when she begins to suspect her sister Lily of causing harm to her own newborn baby.  Upon this discovery, Indie realizes that their mother is the one responsible for Lily's illness, as Lily is responsible for her own daughter's mysterious sicknesses.<br />Writing with poetic insight and incredible subtlety, Greenwood wraps the reader up in the darkness of Munchausen Syndrome by proxy, illustrating its far-reaching effects and ultimately destructive force.  Greenwood's characters are multi-dimensional and real, reacting to each crisis in wholly human ways, flawed and believable.  With each breathtaking revelation, Greenwood captures the moment with startling clarity and brilliant depiction.  Add &quot;Nearer Than The Sky&quot; to your reading list immediately, and grab the tissues.  You'll need them.	2001-05-30

Searles work is vividly imagined and riveting, one of those rare page-turners that avid readers seek out so frequently...reminiscent of that &quot;next fix&quot; mentality.<br />&quot;Boy Still Missing&quot;, with its numerous twists and turns, tells the story of 15-year-old Dominick Pindle, a somewhat troubled teen for whom the wheels of life seem to threaten running him over rather than carrying him to any great destinations. His mother spends many nights dragging him around their &quot;nowhere&quot; New England town, searching rabidly for his father, who may or may not be having an affair with the town beauty.  On one of these numerous drive-by's, Dominick meets Edie, the &quot;other woman&quot;, and nothing is the same ever again.  Finding himself caught up in an escalating nightmare from which he cannot awaken, Dominick watches in horror as his world begins to crash in upon itself.  Searles builds his tension masterfully page after page, culminating in a nail-biting climax that's sure to impress even the most jaded reader.  I found myself having to set this book down and walking away from it for a minute to calm myself down.

In &quot;The Babel Effect&quot;, Daniel Hecht sets out to show us just what havoc such an idea wreaks on not only the characters, but the world as well.  Steeped in Biblical lore (hence the name, stemming from the city of Babel), &quot;The Babel Effect&quot; poses many interesting questions and ideas, then proceeds to strap us into the passenger seat for a wild quest for answers.<br />Dr. Ryan McCloud, and his ultra-beautiful wife Jessamine are two of the world's top thinkers and researchers.  When they, with their loyal team of experts, set out to find the source of what external and internal influence makes a person turn from citizen to killing machine, they don't know exactly what they're getting into. In effect, they are trying to uncover the source of evil, whether it be a manmade source, or a biological one.  Their research uncovers a viper's nest of intrigue, subterfuge, and torture, putting them also in the crosshairs of every underground government group, religious fanatic, and third-world terrorist group. Their digging and tenacious personalities brings the danger right to their doorstep.  Crossing international culture lines and geographical borders, &quot;The Babel Effect&quot; is an &uuml;ber-thriller!<br />Well researched and planned, Hecht writes a thinking-person's novel, bringing up moral, biological, and theological questions, then setting forth ambitiously to answer them.  &quot;The Babel Effect&quot; is one of those books that stays in your head long after you've finished it.	2001-05-20

When Ambrose Pierce was quoted as saying &quot;the covers of this book are too far apart&quot;, he might have been writing about this novel by Sebastian Stuart.  Stuart writes with a chilling intensity, not wasting words to tell his story, yet his plot is all too familiar and overused.  Perhaps &quot;The Mentor&quot; would have worked better as a short fiction, rather than a full-length book.<br />Telling the story of Charles Davis, a once-great writer who is barely hanging onto his socialite wife's pricey shirttails, finds that he has hit bottom.  Rock bottom.  When his wife hires a temp to fill in at her posh office uptown, then hires this same woman to be &quot;secretary&quot; to her struggling husband, Davis finds this new &quot;girl Friday&quot; to be a godsend of sorts.  Although she's been in a mental institution for a good part of her life for possibly murdering her abusive mother, Emma thrives under Charles' attention.  When it's discovered that Emma has a writing talent that is raw and powerful, Charles forms a diabolical plan.<br />One can easily figure out where this story heads from there.  Every character evokes, not sympathy, but apathy, as the story quickly unfolds and rockets to it's expected conclusion.  While a good rainy afternoon diversion, &quot;The Mentor&quot; leaves the reader with a longing to find a good book to read.	2001-05-05

With rich prose and imaginative imagery, it blooms like a garden gone wild.  The oleander, a highly poisonous evergreen shrub, is an apt symbol to use when telling the story of Astrid Magnussen, a young woman torn away from her roots when her mother, Ingrid, poisons and kills a would-be boyfriend who shuns her.  Becoming obsessive, Ingrid stalks the man and in her final passionate plea for attention, concocts a murderous potion in which the white oleander flower is used.  Her subsequent sentence to prison sets young Astrid adrift, floating like a spirit through one foster home after another, learning the poisonous ways of the world in her own way.  She is abused physically, pschologically, and emotionally at every step, and takes on a thorny demeanor in order to keep the world at bay.<br />Told with incredible voice, Fitch portrays the day to day struggles a young woman on her own faces in this great land of ours, seeming to attract only those who would cause her harm.  Through this Job's test of trial and tribulation, Astrid learns to stand up for herself and to pluck the flower of her life while its still in bloom. She blames her mother for everything that has happened to her, but learns that each of us make our own decisions in life, and must live with the consequences.<br />Both sad and uplifting, &quot;White Oleander&quot; is beautifully written, evocative of a female &quot;Catcher In The Rye&quot;.

This is the beautifully crafted story of three friends, Walter, Susan and Mitch, who create memories together while drifting through the world around them like ghosts. This is Walter's story though, a boy whom we watch grow into uneasy adulthood, carrying inside of him all the dreams of his youth, unrealized.<br />Hamilton casts a wondrous spell on the reader with sepia-tinted imagery and poetic phrasing, vivid characters against a background that is at once dreamlike and real. &quot;A Short History of a Prince&quot; is the kind of story that gets lost in the fast-pace of our lives, but would be well-worth slowing down to read.  In the adage &quot;stop and smell the roses&quot;, Hamilton's book is that rose, beckoning alluringly from a place far off the trodden path.  As a first-time reader of her work, I was enthralled from beginning to end, seeking out these pages whenever I could.  Hamilton's writing helped me recapture  emotions that seemed to have faded once I reached adulthood, with striking exactness.  I highly recommend this book for everyone who hasn't taken the time to stop and smell the roses for a long, long time.	2001-04-20

Beginning with the chilling opening scene in which a three year old girl witnesses the cold-blooded and brutal murder of her father, and racing along till the very last page, &quot;Rock Paper Scissors&quot; is an adrenaline rush of a book!<br />Utilizing the precarious political theater of the Middle East, and more specifically, the uncertain future of Saddam Hussien, Samuel has woven an incredible first novel.  Painting his characters in broad strokes, he allows the reader to enjoy the spectacle of politicians with much more than the public eye in mind.<br />Years after she's seen her father gunned down, Sarah Peterson, now a top secret service agent,  is horrified to accidently uncover a plot that could feasibly destroy life on Earth.  This knowledge puts her in the crosshairs of some of the most powerful people in the world...and it's a nail-biting trip to find out if she will win out over the deceit of those she's put in charge of protecting.  &quot;Rock Paper Scissors&quot; is well-written and perfectly executed.  Although it reaches for and misses in some of its imagery, overall, it's a fantastic escape!	2001-04-11

A hundred adjectives leapt to mind when I sat down to write this review of Tami Hoag's brilliant thriller, &quot;Dust To Dust&quot;.  None of them were accurate enough to list here without sounding somewhat sycophantic or gushing like a schoolgirl...so I'll proceed to the details.  Hoag's previous work, &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot;, was my first delightful exposure to her Minnesota-based thrillers, and I thought then that I could see why Hoag is such a sought-after author.  While being a big fan of police thrillers, Hoag takes the prize for creating such multi-dimensional characters, from her heroes and heroines to her crafty villians.  Set in the frigid landscape of the wintery north, Hoag knows how to ever-so-subtly create a sense of increasing tension within her stories, by depicting her protagonists with real and accesible emotions and dilemmas.  I have yet to read another author who does so with such incredible deftness.  Multi-layered and vivid, &quot;Dust To Dust&quot; is one of the best psycho-thrillers this reader has enjoyed in much too long! Count me in with Hoag's legions of fans and avid readers!	2001-04-06

With his &quot;humanitron&quot;, he assists those who wish to die achieve their goals in a &quot;humane and dignified manner&quot;...even if sometimes he leaves the bodies in cheap hotel rooms for someone to find.  Most would consider it a very good day when Mate's body is found, brutally butchered inside his own van, hooked up to the &quot;humanitron&quot;.  It is far too obvious to Detective Milo Sturgis and his long-time confidant, Dr. Alex Delaware, that Mate didn't die in the most humane way.  Nor did he &quot;off himself&quot; with his own machine.  Their investigation leads them down many paths...chasing numerous suspects and cogitating just as many motives.<br />As a long-time fan of Kellerman's &quot;Alex Delaware&quot; series, this reader has analyzed the reasons &quot;Dr. Death&quot;, and Kellerman's previous novel, &quot;Monster&quot;, don't live up to Kellerman's obvious potential.  When Kellerman was writing what he knows, and that is child psychology, his writing shines with knowledge and suspense.  Delaware had a personal interest in not only his patients, but the victims of the tragedies that beset them.  In more recent novels, Kellerman drifts away from the comfort zone and into areas that are already deluged with stories...most of them better plotted, and well-thought out.  While &quot;Dr. Death&quot; has its moments, with some well-spoken phrases and vivid scenes, his stories lack real depth.  Where once his passion was his motivation, now it's as if he's just some guy sitting behind a desk thinking up stories.  &quot;Dr. Death&quot; is socially relevant to our times, but tends to become a bit preachy, and long-winded in spots.  The child characters seem mere cardboard cutouts, gratuitous and out of place in &quot;Dr. Death&quot;.  Kellerman disappoints with this latest story.  It barely held my interest long enough to find out whodunnit.	2001-03-15

Dennis Lehane, creator of such killer novels as &quot;Gone Baby Gone&quot; and &quot;Prayers For Rain&quot;, has drifted off of his standard fare and delved deeper into the dark corners of the human soul, dredging up some intense muck from those depths.<br />Twenty five years ago, three friends were playing on the street in their neighborhood, when a car pulls up, the male driver and passenger convincing the friends that they were cops.  One of the trio got into the car, only to disappear for four days.  He escapes, but seems to leave some essential part of himself back in the dark closet in which he was encaptured. Whispers of what had taken place in those four days circulated amongst the neighborhood, and the unfortunate young man is affected in ways that no one could imagine.<br />Now that the murdered daughter of one of the former three friends is found at the local drive-in, one of the trio, a cop, must divinate the killer's identity, turning over stones, old and new, to find out what took place.  The answers he finds are disturbing and dangerous.<br />Lehane once again uses his uncanny insight to delve below the surface of humanity and uncover it's ugly, blackened underbelly.  With his agile use of concise ideas and concepts, he depicts a world that may not be all that it seems. Telling his tale in more poetic and meandering ways, yet retaining the sharp edges that he's known for, &quot;Mystic River&quot; shines with brilliant insight and a dense substructure of dramatic tension.  I heartily recommend this book to anyone seeking something more from their mystery thriller!	2001-03-04

Caleb Carr, author of such incredible time-travelling murder mysteries as &quot;The Alienist&quot; and &quot;Angel of Darkness&quot;, tries travelling again, only this time forward, into a world that is ripe for war and gullibility, it seems. &quot;Killing Time&quot; is based on the premise that the world depends solely on the internet for its information and news, and that every individual believes all that they find in their apparently endless search for knowledge, using only the easily manipulatable world wide web.  That there is a band of renegades zipping through space, messing with the information available, turning it into disinformation, propaganda and nasty rumour is the plot device Carr uses to lure us in.  Unfortunately for the reader, because this literary trick allows the author to create numerous situations in a relatively small number of pages, it never allows the reader to fully grasp the emotional depth of the characters themselves, nor care about them in the manner one wants to.  The story poses a lot of interesting &quot;what if's&quot;, but those are shallow points to be able to grasp onto...and it makes the story itself seem shallow and pointless.  To serve as a warning to the souls who reside in this era, it's an apt message to give...otherwise, one would be better served finding a different book to read.	2001-02-18

And those secrets may very well end up being the death of Broussard, if she doesn't find out the truth before the killer gets to her.<br />Told in a hauntingly realistic voice, Tami Hoag once again delivers a brilliant mystery thriller, ripe with detail and atmosphere, well-written dialogue, and unforgettable characters.

That all of his troubles seem to manifest from the darkest corners of his own soul is a fact not lost on him.  Aptly comparing &quot;Electric God&quot; to a comprehensive retelling of the Book of Job, Catherine Ryan Hyde delivers a fascinating story, one ripe with strife and human drama, but ultimately leading to a rich redemption one can only feel with the whole of one's heart.  The fierce determination that Reese unfailingly displays shows not only the indomitable spirit of human nature, but that the need to &quot;do good&quot; is so powerful that in the end it may be the only thing that saves him.  Reese makes some hard choices in the face of every adversity and comes out, not so much a winner, but a man at peace with himself at long last...and that in itself is a form of redemption, perhaps one that is ultimately most satisfying.  Hyde has the unerring ability to delve deep into the human heart and emerge holding the answers, or perhaps the key, to our salvation with each other on this earth.  With intelligent dialogue and brilliant plot, &quot;Electric God&quot; is recommended reading for everyone, and is destined to become required reading for human beings everywhere.	2001-01-29

Like the spare imagery of the haiku, &quot;Lying Awake&quot; evokes its poetry with as few words as possible.  This is by far one of Salzman's best works.<br />Sister John of the Cross is searching for answers, and hopes that her response will be the Voice of God, guiding with a gentle hand.  A celebrated poet of the simple lives of the cloister, Sister John lives her days quietly and uneventfully in the last vestiges of solitude in Los Angeles.  That is, until she is visited with images so powerful and breath-taking, she begins to believe her journey to find God is drawing to a climax.  Not so, says the doctors to whom Sister John is taken when she begins to experience mild epileptic seizures.  Her 'visions' are none other than hallucinations brought on by a small 'smudge' on her brain just above her ear.  This revelation about the true source of her Godly images sends Sister John into a crisis of faith that threatens the rest of the nunnery as well as her own peace of mind.<br />Salzman writes as if in a whisper about the quiet ways of those on the chosen Path of God, with delicate reticence, yet manages to tell a poetic tale that brings the reader a certain sense of inner peace as well.  A book to reflect upon in a world that is filled with the faithless and lost.<br />Also recommended:<br />&quot;Agnes De Dios&quot;--Leonore Fleischer &quot;The Blind Side of the Heart&quot;--Michael C.

Susan Price has written an engrossing and rollicking adventure story...one which not only egages the readers intelligence, but their imagination as well.  Taking place in the 16th and 21st centuries simultaneously, this novel of the effects of modern man pillaging the past for his own gain rings true as any...and teaches a lot about integrity and morals along the way.<br />In the 21st century, a mega-corporation has secretly done what the world has been striving for in the whole of history...create time travel.  They've done this by marrying modern technology with old-school methodology, and though not completely accurate, have managed to land in 16th century Europe.  A team of researchers are the first to arrive, and effectively convince the natives of that land that they are &quot;Elves&quot;, capable of unlimited marvel and magick.  The locals, a family by the name of Sterkarm, are afraid and easily manipulated by these strange beings who appear before them as if from nowhere.  The Sterkarms, the fiercest clan in the land, are not as easily led as they lead others to believe.  The researchers largely underestimate the Sterkarms cunning and treachery...hence the title of the book.  Never, ever, shake hands with a Sterkarm.  Hug them, kiss them...but don't rely on their word or their handshake.  This is the mistake the researchers from the 21st side make.  They rely on the natives' gullibility, which proves to be the downfall of the whole time-travel project...not to mention the violent death of many of its team.<br />The team of researchers are there for only one reason.  They recognize the pristine resources of unlimited capacity that the 16th century holds...and with virtually no one to stop them, they plot to make millions of dollars by raping the land of all of its splendor...minerals and ores that have long since become extinct, thanks to the mindless squandering by modern man.  The Sterkarms, though, are not so easily decieved.

Besides, she just robbed a man of over 2 million dollars, a man who is found shot dead in his Las Vegas hotel room bed the following morning.  She needs the dough, but didn't expect quite the amount that she ended up with.  She decides to keep it though, to start a new life for her...and her daughter.  The reader learns of this little 'secret' part of the way into the story, but is not given enough time to adjust to believing that Cassie actually cares for her...yet that is her motivation for doing all that she does.<br />It's on this premise that Michael Connelly builds his latest work.  Well-written, with enough suspense to hook the reader all the way through, the story itself lacks.  The characters come across as mere facades for more promising, better-developed characters lurking just beneath.  While Connelly delivers a technically accurate and exciting story...he seems to leave out the meat---the emotional development.  Had the characters been more detailed, the motivation which carries the plot might have come across as a much stronger foundation.  Since that doesn't happen, the story seems a bit flat and underdeveloped.  The action is intense...if that's all you're looking for.	2001-01-09

He and his mother scheme to come up with the remainder of the costly tuition.  Nat has settled on the New England school of Inverness, a choice that is the catalyst for all the events to follow. Once there, he is befriended by twin sisters, Izzie and Grace Zorn, affluent young women to whom wealth is merely something to which they awaken every day.

I did not expect to find one of the best written, intelligent thrillers I have read in awhile!  I nearly caught the pages on fire, I was turning them so fast!  And I'm told that &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot; isn't even her finest work!<br />Former FBI agent turned Victims Advocate in the chilly climes of Minnesota, Kate Conlan is enjoying the laid-back themes her life has taken since leaving the Bureau.  Too bad for her, it seems then, when a killer known locally as The Cremator begins burning a path through town, leaving charred corpses in his wake...and Kate is assigned the only witness who can identify this gruesome killer.  To top it off, her client is a bratty, foul-mouthed teenage kleptomaniac, facts which don't please Kate in the least. &quot;I don't do kids&quot; is her mantra, all the while being sucked into one of most disturbing cases of her career...albeit, unwillingly.  The case is deemed so disturbing that the local politicians bring in Kate's former partner/boyfriend and top criminal profiler John Quinn.  This only complicates Kates life further.  As the two dance an uncomfortable ballet around each other, trying to find place for their unrequited love, the killer looms ever closer and ever more complex.  As the case escalates exponentially, Kate and Quinn are thrown together not only in emotional turmoil, but as the only ones who can detangle the web that the killer is weaving.<br />Hoag does a brilliant job of portraying the emotional tenseness that Kate and Quinn are experiencing, heightening it with the tense murders and the dense political background that the pair must cut a swath through in order to save themselves, and the next victim.  Hoag's characters are some of the most believable and emotionally real characters I've had the pleasure of meeting...tough as nails on the outside, yet completely unsure and vulnerable...and wraps them in a package that kept me up nights in terrified glee, eagerly turning pages to sop up every delightful, nasty detail.<br />Also recommended: &quot;Deviant Ways&quot;--Chris Mooney &quot;Blindsided&quot;--Clyde Phillips..tough as nails on the outside, yet completely unsure and vulnerable...and wraps them in a package that kept me up nights in terrified glee, eagerly turning pages to sop up every delightful, nasty detail.<br />Also recommended: &quot;Deviant Ways&quot;--Chris Mooney &quot;Blindsided&quot;--Clyde Phillips	2001-01-05

Although the story ends in triumphant redemption, this victory is bittersweet for both Neil and his tormented father.  Both have abandonment issues that color their every decision, and by the final page, each deals with those in cataclysmic ways...resulting in one of the most powerfully triumphant stories to grace a page.  Watt has captured Neil's tortured soul in an original voice, and aptly portrays the effects of two men's choices that go horribly wrong on a family that is already deteriorating beyond repair.  Far from being depressing, &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is hopeful and poetic. A highly recommended read!<br />Also recommended as companion books: &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot;--James Kirkwood<br />&quot;A Separate Peace&quot;--John Knowles<br />&quot;The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys&quot;--Chris Fuhrman	2000-12-16

This bright, shining gem of a story is a welcome diversion from the plethora of thrillers that deluge the market today...and the best thing about it is, Baldacci is one of the best storytellers there are!  &quot;WISH YOU WELL&quot; reads like a somewhat autobiographical tale of a writer and his family who are struck by tragedy one dark night while riding in their car.  Swerving to miss a stranded motorist, Jack Cardinal ends up rolling his vehicle with his wife, son and daughter in it.  He is ejected and killed instantly.  The mother, striving to protect her children, manages to save them, at the expense of herself.  She slips into a coma that lasts years.  The children, alone and devastated, are shipped off by relatives to live with their father's mother--and little Louisa Mae Cardinal's namesake--in a backwoods mountain home that time forgot.  Once there, they rediscover life, love, and a whole range of colorful characters that only Baldacci could bring to life in such a brilliant and quaint way.  Of course, the story slips into a courtroom by the end of it, but the journey there is beautifully crafted and a great journey.  Emotional and tense at times, &quot;WISH YOU WELL&quot; is the perfect tale to discover your own sense of priority in life.	2000-12-08

Peter Moore Smith has reinvented an entire genre in &quot;Raveling&quot;, his first novel.  Calling this an ordinary thriller or even a ghost story would be an insult to his talent as a writer and to the reader as well.  Anyone who enjoys a book that you can't seem to leave far from hand, or a story that wraps its cold, chilling tendrils of suspense around the very center of your being...owe yourselves this book.<br />The Aerie family has unraveled.  The fabric of their lives quickly came apart when Fiona, the youngest child, disappears one small day, which no one notices until a day too late.  But...one suspects that these threads had worked their way loose long before that.  Her disappearance is merely the catalyst for events that were already well on their way.  James, the father, is an airline pilot who would much rather lose himself in the heavens than deal with the mundane matters of family down on Earth.  Hannah, the mother, is the keeper of secrets so heinous that they cause her to go blind.  Ironically, she begins to &quot;see&quot; her missing daughter in strange hallucinations, 20 years after she disappeared.  Eric, the golden child and brilliant neurosurgeon, seems to be the glue that is holding everyone together.  And Pilot...the younger brother and teller of this haunting and beautiful tale...is diagnosed with schizophrenia after he is found in the woods behind the family home, reverted completely to an animal state.  Committed to a local institution, it is here that the chilling tale of the Airie family begins to come to light.  Revealing any more about this fantastic novel would be to give away the ultimate pleasure of reading it.  The story is told in a hauntingly poetic and visionary voice...the characters drawn in strokes that are delicate with nuance, and bold in action.  The definitive story of a family fraught destructive secrets and the havoc that keeping those secrets causes, &quot;Raveling&quot; is added to my top-ten list of all-time favorite reads.  I can only impatiently wait for Smith's next stunning foray into literature, with bated breath.te reads.

His primary demon is the stereotypical one of all literary Irish cops: alcohol.  He invited this particular demon into his life upon the suicide of his long-time partner on the force.  His partner, intelligent and one of N.H.'s best, one day, without warning, pulled out his own service revolver, put it to his head, and pulled the trigger.  Word was that his partner had been slowly and quietly going insane...a fate that O'Hara fears is happening to him.  See, a serial killer, whom O'Hara was instrumental in sending to the electric chair, is impossibly killing again.  And to top it all off, the dead killer himself is visiting O'Hara's house, deep in the deadly grip of an east coast winter.  O'Hara is &quot;this close&quot; to retirement...and doesn't appreciate this last big murder case...nor the fact that he's being pursued by the ghost of a killer, a ghost who is still claiming his unequivocal innocence.<br />One wonders in how many ways an author can show and tell a protagonists disbelief in all things spiritual...reading &quot;A Room For The Dead&quot; will quickly show you exactly how many, and show you how repetitive and irritating such a device can be.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been so bad if the story actually delivered the goods at the end of the 300-something pages this book contains.  But it doesn't, and  O'Hara ultimately just ends up sounding whiny and ridiculous...grating on the nerves.  While the premise of this story is promising, it goes nowhere, and takes a long, long time to get there.	2000-11-13

Philip Pullman is the obvious predecessor of &quot;those other books&quot; in this genre...namely, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series...but with a huge difference.  Pullman creates a world at once believable and fantastical, with enough seriousness to make it all worthwhile!<br />Lyra is just a girl, with no more thought of the future than any young lady.  But, her future, unbeknownst to her, is already underway.  And what an incredible future it is!  It will take her to lands far beyond her imagination, and will introduce her to events that will change her forever.  Her gradual and poignant loss of innocence is well-told, with careful sensitivity to details and a masters eye for magick.

If one could create a new category of fiction, say, in the manner of sports, this first novel by Chris Mooney would be at the top of a list titled: Extreme Fiction.  As one who is never at a loss for words, this incredibly intelligent and mind-rendering thriller evoked only the most astounding comparisons...such as, &quot;Move over Thomas Harris, Chris Mooney has created a bigger, better, and meaner Hannibal Lecter!&quot;  Where once Harris' top-selling book was the litmus test to improve upon, Mooney's &quot;Deviant Ways&quot; is destined to become one to outdo.<br />Jack Casey is a man haunted.  Not by your everyday, run-of-the-mill ghosts...but by his own demons: The face of his former wife as she lay dying only feet away from him, bleeding to death from a slashed throat;  the images of all the victims that he was too late to save as a criminal profiler for one of the nation's top law enforcement agencies, the FBI.  Now retired from the Bureau, but still tormented by his past, Casey is trying to form a new existence, hoping vainly to outrun these demons that insist on following him.  And follow him they do, deep into one of the most intense thrillers ever written.  Like an evil hybrid of Jack Clancy, Thomas Harris, and Jonathon Kellerman, Mooney writes like a man possessed by his own monsters, and his therapy is to purge them onto the page...much to the benefit of the reader.<br />Pursuing Jack Casey is The Sandman, the result of a horrible government drug experiment gone as wrong as possible.  The Sandman is without conscience, remorse, or feeling...but what he lacks in these, he makes up for in cunning and intelligence, and knowledge in explosives.  As Casey tries to out-think The Sandman, he is forced to confront all of his own monsters, not only to save his own life, but those of the people he is beginning to care about as well.<br />With as many twisting turns as a mountain highway, &quot;Deviant Ways&quot; is not for those who read to fall asleep.

In &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;, he introduced us to Homicide Inspector Jane Candiotti, a beautiful, yet emotionally flawed woman who makes some choices that definitely aren't in her best interest.  In Phillips newest novel, &quot;Blindsided&quot;, Candiotti is back, and seems to have grown and even learned from her previous mistakes.  Reaching much more satisfying and believable emotional depths, Phillips pulls out all the stops in this rip-roaring, brilliant thriller.<br />Someone has brutally murdered a homeless junkie.  Just another day on the job for Candiotti and her partner Kenny Marks. ..until they discover that the homeless man was once one of their own.  When yet another officer is brought down, Candiotti begins to suspect that there's more to these seemingly random killings than she can put her finger on. As the killer gets more and more daring, Candiotti and Marks must race to find him before he can kill again.<br />Phillips craftily plays the mounting suspense of the pursuit of the police killer against Candiotti's newfound resolution to settle down and find love, with none other than her partner, Marks.  As her life becomes more and more perfect, the killer gets closer and closer to home...creating some of the most intense dramatic tension captured on a page.  Although the reader finds out who the killer is pretty early on in the story, that knowledge only heightens the adrenaline rush as we follow his every move...and his ultimate target: Jane Candiotti.

Originally published as &quot;Burt&quot; here in the States in 1981, this original and fresh young adult book didn't find immediate success.  Buten then published it in France, where it (and he) became known as &quot;one of France's best-loved contemporary writers&quot;, even though the author and the story are both American.  Go figure.<br />&quot;When I Was Five...&quot; is the wholly original story of Burton Rembrandt, a precocious and misunderstood young man, trying to grow up around adults who seem to have landed here from another planet.  None of their words or actions make much sense to Burton...or Burt...but, neither does he to those who must try and to understand and deal with his unique way of seeing the world around him.  When an event transpires totally out of Burt's control, and the resulting backlash lands him in The Children's Trust Residence Center, Burt finds himself in a dangerous and completely alien new world.  Nothing makes sense to him anymore...and he reacts in the only way he knows how...by throwing tantrums, aching to voice not only his confusion at the treatment he's recieving, but also at his frustration with not being able to communicate with adults.<br />Told completely from Burt's point of view, this story is one of the most intelligent and lyrical stories ever written.  Given the mysticism of youth and told in a voice that is at once immature and completely adult, this goes down as one of the most influential books I have ever read in this genre.  It's message and story literally took my breath away at times...and it's importance lingers long after I've read the last word.	2000-10-13

The action starts on the first page and snowballs like a demon avalanche to the very last!<br />A therapeutic camping trip turns into an ongoing nightmare for Bobby and Susan Martin, a couple whose entire life revolves around starting a family.  When their first child, who they've already picked out a name for (Steven), dies in the last months of pregnancy, the couple is devastated.  Hoping to regain their tattered sense of togetherness, they go off on a weekend outing.  When the night's silence is shattered by the screams of a child, their world quickly takes on its nightmarish hues.  The boy races into their campsite, dirty and horribly frightened, as if the devil himself is in pursuit...and he might very well be.  When a man claiming to be a police officer finds the couple with the child, he demands the boy back, most likely at the cost of Bobby's and Susan's life.  A struggle follows and the results in the death of the unknown man.  In a panic, Bobby and Susan flee the campsite with the boy.  The following story is like a worst-case scenario come true.<br />Taking many conflicting storylines and weaving them intricately together, Gilstrap creates a pulse-pounding page-turner that ranks with the best in the genre.  Intelligent, crafty, and brilliant, this should rank right up with any other modern day thriller!	2000-10-11

It's inevitable  that the progeny of talented horror/erotica writer Anne Rice would try his hand at writing, considering the reputation and formidable empire that his mother has built with her work.  It seems almost as inevitable that her child would attempt to mimic her eloquent style and considerable story-telling talent.  What else could follow but the literary comparisons that spring up with the frequency of weeds in a summer garden.<br />In &quot;A Density of Souls&quot;, Christopher Rice sets out to tell the story of four school friends who live through a summer forming the strong bonds of youth and innocence.  Come Fall, though, as they enter the halls of high school, those bonds are strongly tested when the friends separate and form new alliances and friendships, not always to the benefit of themselves or others.  At the center of this story is Stephen, labeled &quot;the sensitive one&quot; (read gay) who is about to wander into the dark realm of his own sexuality, at the expense of his friends, and quite possibly, his entire world. The following pages are filled with predictable and clumsy attempts at justifying the action the characters are doomed to take.  Without the superb eloquence or skill that should be his heritage, Rice drags the reader through a messy and often confusing story, bringing everything to a cacophonous and unsatisfying end.<br />One can only imagine the reasons why such a book would be allowed publication (string-pulling, anyone?) or allowed to bypass editors without massive revisions or rewrites to make it at least seem as if the author had some idea of what he were doing.  Although there are some passable moments in the story which bring about a glimmer of salvation for the reader (perhaps it WOULD turn out to be a good read after all!), the majority of this book would have been better off left on some computer disk, and stored away in the hopes that its author would forget about it.	2000-10-10

In the world beyond the boundaries of these United States, there are more things that happen than we are ever aware of.  In Jon Land's novel, &quot;A Walk In The Darkness&quot;, we discover exactly what some of those things might be.<br />On the ever-present verge of war, Turkey is shocked by the murder of a group of American archeologists on the brink of making an earth-shattering find: scrolls that may just throw Christianity into a frenzy.  If true, the information contained in these ancient Aramaic scripts will destroy organized religion as it is currently known.  They just may contain information saying that Jesus Christ was never resurrected, because he never actually died on the Cross.  Called into action are Chief Inspector Danielle Barnea of Isreal's National Police, and Palestinian detective Ben Kamal...joining together amidst the heat of the Judean desert to get to the bottom of this mystery.  But the scrolls in question, though missing, may not be the reason the Americans were murdered after all.  Taking all of their combined ingenuity and skill, Kamal and Bernea are pursued from continent to continent once they begin to unravel the true mystery.<br />Divided into nearly 90 bite-sized chapters, Land's novel is a humdinger of a read...drawing the readers attention on with each well-written word.

A reader and contributor to Amazon.com came across a review that I'd done for another author, and sent an email saying that I would benefit greatly from reading Scott Charles Adams first novel, &quot;...never dream&quot;.  Since I recieve numerous recommendations of this sort, most of which turn out to be other authors promoting their own books (not all of which are worth mentioning here), I was very skeptical.  It took a few weeks for me to find a copy of &quot;...never dream&quot;, and was filled with even more trepidation when I saw the grainy black and white cover with the home p.c. designed graphics.  All of that magickally fell away after I began to read...and read, and read.  I ravenously devoured this 240-pager in one sitting.<br />Reading like a serio-comic gothic thriller, &quot;...never dream&quot; deserves a more mainstream release.  Taking the legend of vampires and werewolves and treating them like everyday occurances (if you suspend your need for reality every once in awhile), &quot;...never dream&quot; is hugely entertaining.  Except for the obvious editing errors (one of the main characters somehow loses his Cockney accent about a third of the way into the story) and somewhat tedious and confusing point-of-veiw changes, this story is destined to become a cult classic.<br />Arthur Talon, a 700-year-old vampire, is troubled.  An ancient book, once in his possession, has mysteriously disappeared.  This book, a kind of an &quot;owners manual&quot; for the undead, is a revealing work that, in the wrong hands, is destined to destroy vampire-kind as we know it.  And of course, it is about to fall into the wrong hands...the hands of a relatively young and cocky vampire who goes by the unlikely name of Lyle.  This short but fast-paced story takes an at once serious and tongue-in-cheek view on the whole vampire genre.  Who else would use Anne Rice novels as training manuals for modern-day bloodsuckers?  Telling the story from the point of view of most of the main protagonists, the story becomes a bit diluted and trite...but worth plodding through to unearth the little nuggets of delight that are buried there.<br />Fresh and entertaining, &quot;...never dream&quot; is worth tracking down and owning.e main protagonists, the story becomes a bit diluted and trite...but worth plodding through to unearth the little nuggets of delight that are buried there.  <br />Fresh and entertaining, &quot;...never dream&quot; is worth tracking down and owning.	2000-09-20

This wham-bam shoot-'em-up is furiously paced and intelligent as well.  It  all seems to begin when handsome lawyer David Perry is told by his  beautiful wife that she is suing for divorce.  The following emotional  battle degenerates into a hateful tug-of-war.  Perry moves into a recently  purchased condo, pining for more time with his only daughter, Lily, whom  his soon-to-be ex-wife wants to deny him visitation rights with.  One day,  while taking a seemingly random ride on San Francisco's BART transit  system, Perry strikes up a conversation with Barton Hubble, a  self-proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; on foreign cars...which Perry finds to  be fortuitous, since his BMW's recent mechanical problems are the reason he  says he's been forced to utilize public transit.  The two become unlikely  friends when Hubble offers to fix Perry's car &quot;free of charge&quot;,  in exchange for some free legal advice.  Finding a sympathetic ear, Perry  spills his anger and bitterness about his wife...and suddenly finds himself  in the midst of a murder investigation.  His wife is kidnapped from her own  house one morning, only to be found brutally murdered and buried in a  shallow grave in a nearby park. Enter Jane Candiotti, one of SF's finest  homicide detectives.  Her and her partner Kenny are handed the  investigation, on top of an already full case-load.  What the pair don't  realize is exactly how complicated their lives and their careers are about  to become.  When Jane falls in love with Perry, much to the anger and  dismay of her partner, the story takes a series of astounding and thrilling  twists.<br />Phillips knows how to pace his story and throw in just enough  action and intrigue to make this not only a page-turner, but a page-burner  as well!

And he precisely captures the freezing January  landscape and no-nonsense mentality of the citizens who choose to live  there.  Justice is swift and hard during the frozen months of the midwest,  and no one shows that more exactly than Harstad in his latest novel,  &quot;The Big Thaw&quot;.  Depicting the flat, somewhat uninteresting  landscape of the American heartland as the breeding ground for many of the  worlds anarchist, right-wing crazies, Harstad paints a perfect portrayal of  what can happen when one such group makes the mistake of calling Nation  County, Iowa, home.  At least in the eyes of Carl Houseman, a slow-moving  but very intelligent deputy Sheriff.  Houseman stumbles on a surprising  scene one bitter-cold night when he intercepts a call on his walkie-talkie  regarding a local kid who was found behaving suspiciously in town.  Houseman reluctantly responds, and finds himself in the midst of a gruesome  but cleverly concealed murder scene.  True, the recent series of cat  burglaries suddenly seemed to have been solved with the arrest of Fred  Gothler, aka &quot;Goober&quot;, a slow-witted 20-year-old with a history  of misdemeanors on his rap sheet.  But what Houseman uncovers is a plot far  more disturbing than he expected.  A militant group, led by a man dubbed  &quot;Gabriel&quot;, is planning a grand heist to raise money to finance  his &quot;next big move&quot;, and has chosen Nation County in which to  pull it off.  Houseman finds the bodies of two brothers, and the race to  find the murderers and stop the massive bank robbery is on.<br />Using dry  humor, midwestern sensibility and inflection in his tale, Harstad delivers  one of the finest works in his ongoing Nation County series.  Like taking a  stroll down a gravel country road, &quot;The Big Thaw&quot; takes its time  getting to its point, but the trip there is time well-spent.

Joseph Glass has mastered control of the human endocrine system with  &quot;Blood: A Susan Shader Novel&quot;.  Displaying perfect control, he  deftly manipulates your adrenal gland with just the right amount of  reserve...slowly building his plot with unexpected twists and excellent  characterization.  He knows just when to push the button to make you jump,  and when to withhold to increase the dramatic tension.  A follow-up to  &quot;Eyes&quot;, his first novel, this second effort far surpasses the  first.<br />Susan Shader returns in &quot;Blood...&quot; as the psychologist  with an added gift...second sight.  But this &quot;gift&quot; is more of a  curse than a blessing for her.  Although it helped to save her son in the  first novel, it also was the reason several innocent people died.  Clairvoyance, after all, is not an exact science.  Ambiguous in its  visions, it can be interpreted in many ways...and Shader knows that she  must use it with extreme caution.  She has learned to downplay it whenever  possible and cringe when forced to rely on it for help.  Unfortunately, a  killer as surfaced in Chicago and is draining blood from his victims...the  police confounded by a lack of usable information, forcing them to turn to  Shader once again for help. Haunted by errors she made previously, she  approaches this most recent case with definite trepidation and dismay...but  also with a bit more determination to do right.  Personal guilt is her most  ferocious detractor...not to mention the numerous officials who would  rather see her banished to some far corner of the earth before they would  admit that her second sight even exists.  It's this tension upon which  Glass builds his story...effectively and powerfully.  Giving Shader such  derailing emotions, he creates a credible foundation on which his  characters play out their drama.<br />Although he follows nearly the identical  format here as he did in his first book, Glass manages this time to fine  tune it and create a hugely complex plot and a much more satisfying climax.  His plot twists are more surprising, his characterization more detailed,  and his story much more engrossing.  I would highly recommend this book to  anyone who likes being grabbed by their lapels and hurled into a great  read.

Otherwise, I think the Learning Channel is showing a rerun of the  mating habits of South African bees.	2000-09-12

And what if  the two young men making that choice get caught up in a murder and its  subsequent cover-up?  That's the premise that Gary Krist lays before us in  this, his latest thriller.  Set in the tawdry political background of our  nation's capitol, &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; leads us down one dark alley  after another, chasing possibilities in this &quot;by the numbers&quot;  thriller.<br />The two young protagonists of this novel find themselves  experiencing the same situation from wholly different backgrounds...Jason  is white, and Dennis is black.  Because of this fundamental difference, and  despite the fact that these two are best friends, their experience spins  them in two totally different directions.  Jason goes on the lam, running  from more than just his pursuers.  He is running from his personal life as  well.  Dennis, because he is black, sees his tenuous future crumbling  before him, sure to be somehow implicated in the drama which unfolds based  solely on the color of his skin.  When Dennis becomes a captive in the  political game which is being played, the story roars toward its thrilling  conclusion.<br />While there are no surprises in the telling of this tale, the  action is in high gear, and the characters play their parts well. Somewhat  predictable, but fully entertaining, &quot;Chaos Theory&quot; is well worth  the time spent reading it.	2000-09-02

It is always with a sense of anxiety that one picks up a Peter Straub  work...that feeling akin to coming unexpectedly upon the scene of a violent  accedent while driving to a favorite vacation spot.  Lulled into a false  feeling of luxurious complacency, the horrific spectacle of glittering  glass and bloodied pavement is at once terrible and fascinating.  No matter  how many stories one reads in a lifetime, Straub can have that same,  irreversible effect on a reader.<br />&quot;Magic Terror&quot;, his latest  collection of short fiction, is no different.  From first word to last, it  is impossible to tear your eyes from the page.  His elegant prose wraps  itself insidiously around your every thought and lingers there like the  remnants of a terrifying childhood nightmare.  The seven tales here are  classic Straub...haunting and beautiful.<br />The most astonishing piece is  the story entitled &quot;Bunny Is Good Bread&quot;.  Appropriately dedicate  to horror-meister Stephen King (with whom Straub collaborated with on  &quot;The Talisman&quot;), &quot;Bunny&quot; is the hypnotic tale of the  childhood of a boy who will grow up to be a serial killer.  Evoking William  S. Burroughs in its disconnected imagery and narrative style,  &quot;Bunny&quot; is one of the most grotesque and horror-inducing works of  fiction Straub has ever written.  The story is worth reading twice, just to  be sure that no small detail is overlooked.  While the remaining six  stories are Straub at the top of his form, it's &quot;Bunny&quot; that  stays firmly implanted in ones mind.  Worth every penny of the cover price,  &quot;Magic Terror&quot; will increase the value of every literary  collection that it graces!	2000-08-22

When this book was recommended to me as a work of &quot;young adult sci-fi&quot;, I was dubiously interested.  Five pages into &quot;Jumping  Off The Planet&quot;, I was anxiously reading to find out more!  One would  hardly call this brilliantly realized sci-fi story suitable for &quot;young  adults&quot; entirely, but it is told from the perspective of an  intelligent, curious, 13-year-old boy.<br />When Charles &quot;Chigger&quot;  Dingillian is approached by his mostly-absent father to take a little  &quot;vacation to the Moon&quot; with him, Chigger figures it to be yet  another empty promise made to him by one of his emotionally manipulative  and unstable parents.  The Earth was becoming vastly overcrowded, and  disease-ridden, but such was life on the planet.  Chigger had his music as  escape, recently having &quot;discovered&quot; the raw emotional beauty of  20th century jazz musician John Coltrane.  He plugged in whenever his  mothers incessant harping and belittling became too much to handle...and  that was most of the time.  Caught in the middle of a bitter custody battle  for him and his two brothers, Chigger decides that even if his father makes  promises that he can't keep, he might as well accept his father's offer.  Couldn't hurt.  Little does Chigger know that his father, desperate, broke,  and willing to do almost anything to save his own butt, is kidnapping them  and involving them (without their knowledge) in a smuggling scheme  &quot;guaranteed&quot; to make him rich.  Nothing turns out as planned  though.<br />As the tension escalates, and the anxiety between siblings,  father, and new friends reaches increasingly higher levels of deceit and  manipulation...Chigger realizes that his dysfunctional family is far more  unsalvageable than even he knew.  His decision to divorce his parents is  only one of the incredible climaxes of this fascinating story.  Though  simplistic at times, it is only so because of the maturity level of its  narrator.  David Gerrold does an awesome job of believable  storytelling...down to the finest details of life in the 21st century.  Politics, national intrigue, and familial greed all escalate this  satisfying tale.  The ability of Chigger to absorb all that happens around  him and still make an adult decision based on these facts, drew me in and  held me until the very last page!  I recommend this to everyone!David Gerrold does an awesome job of believable  storytelling...down to the finest details of life in the 21st century.

Based on tangible evidence, and the the intangible psychic visions of  long-time friend and confidant Dr. Susan Shader, Gold rushes to close the  case that has beleaguered the city for months.  Though Shader has  misgivings and secret doubts about the man they arrested, she keeps them to  herself.  Her reticence blows up in her face when the man arrested as the  murderer kills himself in his cell, and days later, another victim is found  mutilated in the same manner as the previous ones.  Self-esteem dangerously  low, and reputation destroyed, Shader goes into a reclusive state.  Shunned  by the public and vilified by the Chicago Police Department, Shader vows  never to trust her visions again.  Until the apple-of-her-eye is abducted  in plain view of hundreds of witnesses...her son.  Though his kidnapping  happens in the midst of O'Hare airport, no one has seen the boy nor his  abductor.  Shader knows she must work quickly (and alone) to save her  boy.<br />Though the book jacket likens &quot;Eyes&quot; killer to Hannibal  Lecter...the insidious evil of the Harris novels is sadly absent. We are  not privy to the thoughts and dark workings of the killers mind here, but  the story itself is not lacking because of it.  A thrilling page-turner,  &quot;Eyes&quot; is bound to keep the reader wanting more!	2000-08-16

This tongue-in-cheek work from Dave Eggers, former editor of &quot;Might&quot; Magazine, is definitely heartbreaking.  The death of both  parents withing weeks of each other sends Eggers and his siblings into a  tailspin, thrust suddenly into orphanhood, with Eggers finding himself the  &quot;mother figure&quot; for his 8-year-old brother. The resulting  &quot;true story&quot; is told with raw energy, candor, and a blustering  sense of self-importance.  It is this latter factor that slowly drains away  the momentum from what could have been a true work of staggering genius.  Told in a stream-of-consciousness style narrative, &quot;...Genius&quot;  meanders its way to a muddled conclusion...but it is sheer entertainment  along the way!  The voice is fresh (if a bit cynical) and &quot;tells it  like it is&quot;.  Skewering everything from MTV's &quot;The Real  World&quot; to motherhood, &quot;...Genius&quot; is at least worth the time  to read it cover to cover.	2000-08-09

The makings  of an incredibly intriguing and beguiling mystery.  Unfortunately, in the  hands of Tony Strong, what comes out of this mix is merely a hodge-podge of  information and characters that act in predictable and unintelligent ways.  It's as if the author attempted to attract too wide a range of readers, but  only succeeds in confusing a perfectly good premise with overkill and an  unbelievable plot.<br />Terry Williams, the lead character, begins the story  proclaiming herself to be a lesbian scholar, researching the history of a  woman who was burned as a witch centuries earlier--but who may have been  lesbian as well, and burned instead for that.  Her goal is perhaps to bring  the persecution of witches in Scotland into the present by comparing the  modern day persecution of gays and lesbians.  Through letters and research,  Terry gets closer and closer to the truth...or what she thinks is the  truth.  In fact, she uncovers another mystery altogether--the recent murder  of a local woman who might possibly have been killed by the local witch  coven.  In a wholly predictable move, Terry enters the coven under false  pretenses...and lands immediately in the bed of the most handsome male of  the group.  Is she using him, or he her?  Who cares...it has no bearing on  the plot.  Soon enough, Terry finds herself vying for the affections of a  local pig farmer (and you can draw your own analogy from that) in whose  &quot;Death Pit&quot; (the trough dug for disposing of pig carcasses) the  murder victim's body was found.  The story deteriorates from there. (again,  no pun intended)<br />Though the historical information regarding the witch  hunts and trials in Scotland are fascinating, if a bit morbid, the  interwoven storyline is a distraction.  While the bookjacket suggests a  mystery extraordinaire, it was as interesting as a made-for-tv-movie in its  second or third showing....and about as well written.  Trudging through the  last few chapters I found myself eager for its end...so I could move on.  Once committed to reading it though, I felt obligated to finish, much to my  disappointment.jacket suggests a  mystery extraordinaire, it was as interesting as a made-for-tv-movie in its  second or third showing....and about as well written.

Secrets no one seems to want to talk about and secrets most would completely deny the exixtence of...that is, until two of the town's favorite daughters go  missing.  In the ensuing uproar over their disappearance, a battle cry  erupts from one of the girls' father--a wealthy and influential member of  the town.  His vengeance is aimed squarely at the head of Thomas Tripp,  former local English teacher and recent confidant of the two &quot;Lost  Girls&quot;.<br />The resulting search of Tripp's apartment (and his recent  past) reveal a defeated, haunted man with secrets of his own.  The walls of  his modest teachers apartment are heavily adorned with thousands of cut-out  pictures of young girls in various stages of undress--gleaned from teen  girl magazines and catalogues.  Muddy clothing found in his clothes hamper,  and a bloodstained rear seat in his car seem to point to his unequivocal  guilt.  The fact that he recently experienced a painful divorce and  subsequent loss of visitation rights to his only daughter (because of very  questionable behaviour) only increase the appearance of his involvment.  Tripp is arrested and held in the disappearance of the two girls.<br />Enter  Bartholomew Christian Crane, a still wet-behind-the-ears young attorney  from a neighboring city--and newest member of &quot;Lie, Gettemoff, and  Associates&quot;, a not-too-prestigious law firm known for defending some  of the country's more despicable criminals.  Crane, accompanied by the  diparaging comments of the senior partners of the firm and a cocaine  addiction larger than his rented Lincoln Continental, appears reluctantly  in the town of Murdoch, where the story takes place.  He is fully prepared  to do whatever it takes to procure Tripp's freedom...even withhold  evidence.  What Crane doesn't realize is that he's headed directly into the  nightmare of his own past--long repressed and thought forgotten.  As  the insidious secrets that hide in the town of Murdoch slowly seep into  him, Crane begins to realize that those very secrets are his secrets as  well.  As he loses control of the case and his own mind, we witness the  inevitable destruction of two men, a town, and the results of what secrets  can do to the very fabric of life.<br />Ghosts come in many forms.  Andrew  Pyper creates a disturbing, ominous, and wholly memorable ghost story in  &quot;Lost Girls&quot;.  Painting this dark mystery as a bleak landscape of  self-destruction and courtroom drama, he draws an eerie portrait of man's  vastly troubled soul, using faulted human canvasses.  His depiction of a  town and its people caught in the undertow of the past is incredibly vivid  and nightmarish at the same time.

From the very first page, author Timothy Findley insinuates his haunting prose through the multi-layered folds of your mind, bringing about a trance-like ecstacy...which continues till the very last word.<br />The story  of Pilgrim, an enigmatic soul in the form of a man, is found hanging from a  tree, an apparent suicide.  Rumors of his death, however, are greatly  exaggerated, for this is not the first attempt he has made on his own life  and recovered to tell about it.  The hanging that begins this story,  though, comes to the attention of Carl Gustav Jung, the noted  psychotherapist, who is just coming into his own at the time of Pilgrim's  untimely un-demise.  To relate the rest of this epic retelling of such  historical events as the creation of the Mona Lisa, or the life of Oscar  Wilde, one would be denied the ultimate pleasure of experiencing it for  ones self!  Findley takes events that have been endlessly documented and  gives them a fresh voice, a daunting task, to be sure.  Not since reading  Caleb Carr's &quot;The Alienist&quot; has this reviewer enjoyed such a  vivid and imaginative story from beginning to end.  And not the  fun-for-the-moment satisfaction of many of todays novels...but a true,  deep-seated satisfaction that lingers in the soul. Pilgrim's search for  &quot;eternal peace&quot; and the simultaneous epiphanies experienced by  Herr Doktor Jung, weave together some of the most fascinating thoughts and  images in print today.  It was an enthralling read, and one that I would  highly recommend to any literary enthusiast or weekend historian.	2000-07-15

And even when the stone  sinks quickly beneath the surface, it only sinks mere inches into the  shallow water.  Too shallow to even be called a lake.  A puddle, really.  Peter Weltner sets out to tell the interrelated stories of the Odom  family...a family torn apart by war, both inside and outside of its  familial structure.  Through the eyes of each individual character, we find  out a little something about this war torn family...very little.  We feel  that there is so much more to learn than what we're being told, but somehow  aren't quite privileged to that information.  In the narrative voices of  both male and female family members, it's the men we find telling the most  compelling and memorable stories...and the most believable.  The women's  voices don't ring true, sounding forced and flat, while the men's are rich  and vibrant with emotion.  Even with such an undertaking though, we feel  cheated and unsatisfied with the results.  For an author to take on such an  ambitious narrative device, he would need to delve deeply into the hearts  of each person and flesh them out more vividly on the page...much more so  than is done here.  I walked away from this book with a feeling that I  needed about ten more pages for each character to get a strong sense of who  they are, or who they were trying to be, which is unfortunate.	2000-07-06

Yes, we all know about  Dorothy and her annoying little dog...the twister, the house... But, how  much were we told about how Oz came to be, or Munchkinland, or the Wizard  himself?  We were expected to accept these places and things as they were,  without any explanation, and as kids, we did.  We accepted that Glinda was  the good witch and that the Wicked Witch of the West was evil...but why?  Well, when you read &quot;Wicked&quot;, you get the story, warts and all!  You find that perhaps the Wicked Witch of the West (born Elphaba) wasn't  entirely acting out of pure evil at all, nor was Glinda acting on behalf of  all that's good.  You find that perhaps there was a lot more going on in  that particular world than you ever imagined...but luckily for all of us,  Maguire does an excellent job of imagining it for us!  The politics, the  treachery, the origin of The Wiz himself...all of this included in this  highly readable, immensely likeable book!<br />Don't start it expecting to  read another take on Dorothy or her adventure in the &quot;wonderful Land  of Oz&quot;.  She doesn't even enter into the picture until the very end!  What you will find is an incredibly imagined story, for adults, that you'll  find yourself thinking about for a long time after you've finished reading  it!	2000-06-28

And if you extend that metaphor out further, you'd eventually realize that  each &quot;line&quot; of amphetamine that was heartily devoured in this  story could be compared to the reader devouring each line of text in the  same addicted manner.<br />&quot;Radboy&quot; thinks differently than anyone  he knows.  He has to, to survive.  Only 14, and a deaf-mute, he lives  moment to moment on the street, never sure where his life is taking him.  He fled his abusive father, but not before his father attempts to kill him  for falsely testifying against him in the &quot;accidental&quot; death of  Radboy's mother.  He is rescued and taken in by &quot;Jonnyboy&quot;,  another street survivor, and sworn &quot;meth&quot; addict...or tweeker.  Jonnyboy and Radboy become good and fast friends, mainly because on the  street, there aren't many you can trust.  Through Jonnyboy, Radboy learns  quickly the ways to survive, and is introduced to Jonnyboy's various  friends, whom Radboy takes to hanging out with when Jonnyboy disappears for  days at a time.<br />The story is told solely from the perspective of Radboy  in a hyperkinetic narrative that free-associates its way to a brutal and  nail-biting climax.  The narrative device is at first off-putting, but  lends itself perfectly to the story once the rhythm is found.  We find  ourselves following Radboy and his exploits almost as if we ourselves are  amped up on speed and anxious for action.  In this, his first novel, Kief  Hillsbery delivers a fantastic new perspective to the world around us, and  wraps it up in a tidy moral story about trust, real family, and friendship.  I eagerly await his next book!	2000-06-15

His well-ordered world does not accomodate anything for which he has not carefully planned.  The only thing in his life in which he allows himself to be at all whimsical, is  when he's surrounded by classical music.  In fact, that is his one true  passion, but even then he struggles to find the meaning...the ORDER in it.  He must fit it into his view of how the world works in order to understand  it.  It is London, 1906, and the doctor is a pioneer in what he terms  &quot;clinical suggestion&quot;...or what we would call hypnotism.  He  struggles to be successful in an era when clinical psychology is just  appearing--and Sigmund Freud has yet to make a name for himself.  This is  why he only takes on patients with which he is certain of his ultimate  success in treatment.  That is until Sylvie Blum is brought into his  clinic, knocked unconcious by morphine, and accompanied by her father and  her nanny.  They bring with them a strange tale...the young girl has  stopped eating, drinking, or bathing.  In fact, she seems to be terrified  of water altogether. Thus begins &quot;Perlman's Ordeal&quot;.  As he  struggles to find the source of the young girls trauma, he begins to  uncover even stranger information--of the mythical city of Atlantis.  His  efforts to &quot;cure&quot; the girl are unsuccessful, and lead Perlman  (called &quot;pearl-man&quot; by the young girl) down avenues bizarre and  disconcerting.<br />While Brooks Hansen evokes powerful images of time and  place, the story itself seems to meander down blind alleys and meaningless  streets.  The subject matter is intriguing, but never uncovers any  untrodden paths.  Hansen is adept at writing, and pulling the reader into  his story, but once there,  are left to wonder why they came in the first  place.  His characterization is colourful and pleasing...but one wishes  these characters had more direction and substance.  A good read, but  ultimately disappointing.	2000-06-08

I was hooked after reading &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;, (forget the mediocre movie), but if it's possible to become a certified junkie, then I have become just that!<br />Lincoln Rhyme,  the grumpy, curmudgeonly, wheelchair-bound, quadriplegic forensic detective  (though he detests being labelled merely a &quot;forensic&quot; anything),  returns with his model-turned-police officer partner, Amelia Sachs.  Rhyme,  with his C-4 spinal injury, and Sachs, with  her self-destructive  behaviour, make an unlikely pair...and unlikely lovers.  Both carry enough  psychic and emotional baggage to fill a barn--yet together they make an  excellent team.  They travel together to a hospital in North Carolina where  the medical doctors there specialize in experimental treatment of exactly  the kind of spinal injury that Rhyme suffers from.  Though the treatment is  unproven and risky, Rhyme insists on going through with it, much to Sachs  disapproval.  While waiting to check into the hospital, the pair are  approached by police officers from a neighboring town, referred by a cousin  of one of their officers who had worked previously with Rhyme.  They were  investigating the case of a 16-year-old boy, highly disturbed, who had  allegedly kidnapped two women, and possibly killed a number of other  people.  The case was becoming more than they could handle alone, and  practically beg Rhyme to help them.  But there's more to this case than  they are being told.  Much, much more!  Due to the dizzying talents and  skills of Rhyme and Sachs, the boy is apprehended merely halfway through  the book.  In the hugely capable hands of Deaver, though, the story is only  getting warmed up.  When Sachs, taking pity on the scared boy, breaks into  the local jail and escapes with him, it's certain that the reader is in for  an edge-of-the-seat story whose end comes all too quickly!  It takes every  ounce of cunning and intelligence Rhyme has to find Sachs and the boy  before they are both killed by not only the local police, but a group of  moonshine-crazed vigilantes who seem hellbent on beating everyone to the  kill.<br />A page-turning, sweat-churning exercise in reading, &quot;The Empty  Chair&quot; is one of the finest murder/mysteries to come along in many  years.  Deaver makes his characters jump off the page and yet wholly  vulnerable--a combination that works well in drawing ones sympathy and care  about the outcome.

And when I say that I couldn't wait to finish  it, it is merely to indicate that it was to be done with it and never see  it again.  &quot;Sons of the City&quot; is basically a 308-page script for  a mediocre television crime drama.  My guess would be that someone watched  one-too-many episodes of Starsky &amp; Hutch as a young adult and parlayed  it into a novel.  To be fair, this story does have all the necessary  ingredients of a hard-boiled mystery...but unfortunately, the ingredients  were left sitting out far too long and had already gone stale by the time  they were used.  The good cop, the bad cops, the mob boss and his henchman,  the black community of some inner city...all these are here, but you could  most likely guess the storyline and the outcome just from reading this  review!  The characters were wooden, mouthing exceptionally predictable  dialogue, and the action was related in such a monotonous voice, I nearly  acquired a bout of narcolepsy while trudging my way through it.

He's found his niche in the world of police mysteries, and he is the master of his craft.  I first stumbled across his 87th Precinct stories in junior high...lured in as I was by a tittilating  cover of a book called &quot;Fuzz&quot;, with a drawing of Lonie Anderson  and a nude of Burt Reynolds staring boldly out at me.  Hormones in turmoil,  I embarrassedly checked it out of the school library.  I devoured that book  as fast as my teenage mind could handle it...and I've been a fan ever  since.  McBain has found the winning formula once again, bringing the  detectives of the 87th Precinct into yet another brain-teasing murder  mystery.  By now, these detectives feel like family to me...I know their  histories and their quirks, told at times in all seriousness, and at other  times with a sense of irony and dry wit that only McBain can deliver.  The  dialogue is sharp, the pace is quick, and the climax is completely  satisfying.  If you're not already a fan of the 87th Precinct, I recommend  picking up ANY of his books...you won't be disappointed.  If you know of  what I write, then by all means, grab this newest addition to McBain's  prolific career--I found it to be one of his best.  But I say that about  all of his books!	2000-05-20

It's about love, trust,  friendship, and lies.  It's about not knowing the easy answers, nor knowing  where to turn when your world turns upside-down.<br />The story centers around  a murder that may or may not have been committed by two friends, and the  young man who loves one of these would-be murderers.  Drew Burke is  attending Johns Hopkins University on scholarship, where he befriends and  becomes utterly enchanted by a rich, exotic and beautiful girl by the name  of Bahar.  The two become fast friends, but their friendship is not all it  seems on the surface.  Soon, Drew finds himself pushed into the arms of  Bahar's brother Jake...and the ensuing drama that unfolds is enough to make  Drew wish he'd never met either of these two supposed friends.  Lies,  deceit, manipulation and murder...a lethal cocktail which fuels this  fast-paced, hallucinatory novel.<br />Niehart once again accurately captures  the voice of youth, and the seemingly endless possibilities of every choice  one makes.  The confusion, and the way in which our hearts can lead us to  make the wrong choices even when our intentions are good.  I found myself  utterly transfixed by the events as they unfolded, like a gawker at the  scene of a horrible accident....unable to tear myself away.	2000-05-17

In this era of buddy movies and feel-good groups of friends relating in the post-college world, Jonathon Tropper's &quot;PLAN B&quot; fits right in there with the best of them.  Like a postmodern episode of  &quot;Friends&quot;, Tropper presents his party of five with tongue firmly  planted in cheek, and plot delicately balanced between reality and  Hollywood.<br />A decade ago, five idealistic friends (Ben, the narrator;  Lindsey, his then girlfriend; Chuck, the overweight geek cum womanizer;  Alison, the soft-spoken one; and Jack, the all-american boy turned  Hollywood superstar) graduated from NYU, rush headlong into the world, only  to find, as they turn thirty, that the world has teeth and bites back with  a vengeance.  Each one seems to have suffered some injustice on their  path...and as they converge one fatal summer to intervene in what becomes a  comedic and often insightful display of aggressive friendship toward Jack,  the more successful, yet most drastically flawed of the group--each learns  a valuable lesson about him or herself that carries the story along quickly  to its predictable resolution.  I found the ending much too tidy and  &quot;Hollywood&quot; for my taste, but feel that the writing style,  character development, and emotional atmosphere rang true.  Tropper  delivers, in a loud, clear voice, a delightful work of fiction, from which  I learned a little about the world around me, and even a little about  myself.  This one is highly recommended.	2000-05-15

Emile &quot;Meely&quot; LaBauve is destined to become one of the most unforgettable characters to emerge in literature in many years.  Everyone talks about finding &quot;the next Holden Caulfield&quot;, or becoming the  next Salinger...but until Ken Wells set out to tell this story, they didn't  know what they were talking about!<br />&quot;Meely LaBauve&quot;, (pronounced  Le-Bove, as in &quot;cove&quot;) is set in the Loosiana bayous and  backwoods...brought to insect-buzzing life in the talented hands of Ken  Wells. The narrator, 15-year-old Meely, is a modern day Tom Sawyer, prone  to playin' hooky from school and getting into all kinds of trouble.  He  lives in a rundown &quot;shack&quot; in the woods with his Daddy, a man  known all-too-well by the local police, and by the folks who live in the  neighboring woods...but for different reasons.  The law sees him as a bad  father and a drunk, given to bouts of illegal activities that they would  rather put a permanent stop to...but can't seem to pull their heads out of  their behinds (where it seems to be firmly lodged right up to their red  necks...) long enough to catch him.  Or it may just be that Meely's father  isn't as dumb as they think he is.  Their neighbors consider him a  &quot;character&quot; who delivers fresh caught game to their doorstep, and  a story or two to entertain them. Meely and his daddy survive alone  together, though more often than not, Meely's father is off somewhere  &quot;taking care of business&quot;, where he remains for days at a time.  Meely's mother died in childbirth when Meely was seven...so he's learned  how to survive by his own wits and resourcefulness most of his young life.  And survive he has, despite the many people who would do him harm...and his  daddy as well.  The tension builds throughout the story, coming to  full-boil finally, like a cauldron of gumbo left on the fire too long.  The  manner in which Meely deals with his world and the circumstances which  transpire is like reading poetry with a cajun dialect--beautiful and  magical.  Meely outfoxes every person with bad intent toward him, but does  it in such a way that you root for him the entire time.  Wholly likeable  and charming, Meely stays with you long after you've finished reading.<br />To  compare Wells to Mark Twain in his prime would be to flatter Twain, as he'd  likely say himself were he around to enjoy this delightful novel.  This one  makes my top 5 list of all-time favorite reads!  But don't believe me, read  it for yourself!ire is like reading poetry with a cajun dialect--beautiful and  magical.

The plot develops in a casual, meandering style, like a stroll through a woods in autumn.  The characters enter the story in a similar pace, thoroughly revealing their all-too-human failings as they emerge.  These  faults are the back upon which the reader finds himself riding, taken along  into a world of dark psyches and deep horrors that are unleashed upon the  students of a small, private school.  The students themselves are products  of dysfunctional homes and broken dreams, and the ensuing nightmare which  is slowly realized by the staff and students seems almost expected by  them...as if the very fact of their existence should somehow be punished.  And punished they are when Dr. Hawthorne, himself a man searching for  redemption after the fiery death of his wife and only daughter, in which he  failed to rescue them, stumbles upon a disturbing plot delicately woven by  the staff of the school.  While the bodies begin piling up and the dark  winter descends upon the region like madness, the truth is carefully  uncovered in a shocking and riveting finish.  Dobyns manages to play upon  the bleakest knowledge of the human heart, pulling you in and refusing to  release the pressure until the final page.  His marvelous use of  characterization and storyline serve to make this a fantastic novel!	2000-05-08

Rick Sanford (aka Ben Barker, a 1970's gay adult film star), tells the somewhat autobiographical tale of a man in his early 40's who questions the confusing moral judgments of the world around him.  The story's narrator,  Rick, is an out of work actor, living from unemployment check to  unemployment check, and seemingly morally bankrupt, at least in the eyes of  the people around him.  An avowed homosexual, atheist, and non-Jewish, Rick  becomes fascinated with the boys whom attend the Hassidic school across  from where he lives.  His fascination turns to fixation when he begins to  dress like the boys in their traditional Jewish garb.  His reasons for  doing such are suspect, as he changes his response nearly every time he's  asked.  His behaviour, though, attracts the attention of the boys in the  school and a few of the instructors as well.  They aren't sure if they're  being ridiculed by a foolish man or complimented by Rick's devotion to  learning all there is to learn about the Hassidic Jews.  The boys in turn  become fascinated with Rick and his immoral lifestyle, for which he refuses  to apologize...in fact, he revels in it before them, claiming to have slept  with at least 2,000 men in his lifetime.  He shares pictures of naked men  with the boys, and other facets of his life...and one is never quite sure  if he is seducing the boys, or merely without inhibitions about who he is.  The sexual tension and seemingly inevitable seduction which lurks on the  near horizon provides the drama around which the story unfolds.  No issue  is left unchallenged, and a dividing line the width of the street between  the school and Rick's front steps seems to be the battle line drawn in the  lives of these characters.<br />Told in a very simplistic manner, Sanford is  able to convey the growing tension in these relationships meaningfully and  satisfactorily.  When the heat is turned up and violence boils over,  causing an even deeper chasm to divide the factions, you are pulled ever  deeper into the morals of each side and wonder which will win out,  religious belief or the moral decay which Rick seems to signify.  A taut  little story, as informative as it is entertaining.pulled ever  deeper into the morals of each side and wonder which will win out,  religious belief or the moral decay which Rick seems to signify.

Nora Kelly is an  assistant professor at the Santa Fe Archeological Institute, feeling quite  burned out with her academic life. Her heart's passion is to be out in the  wilderness making great discoveries in the name of bettering humankind.  Her father, an archeologist as well, but better known as a man with dreams  bigger than facts could support, mysteriously disappeared sixteen years  earlier while pursuing the mythical Quivira--an ancient lost city rumored  to contain the world's wealth in gold.  His disappearance leaves Nora and  her younger brother Skip to fend for themselves.  Nora has begun to make a  name for herself, but her brother battles with his need to drink himself  into oblivion.  One night, Nora is drawn inexplicably to her family's  now-abandoned and delapidated ranch, where she is terrifyingly and  viciously attacked by what she at first thinks are wild dogs, but turn out  to be somehow human.  In her flight to escape her attackers, she happens  coincidentally upon a letter, addressed to her deceased mother...from her  father.  In it, he hints at his discovery of his fabled Quivira, but the  letter is more enigmatic than informative.  Thus begins one of the most  memorable adventure stories of the past decade, as Nora convinces her  employer to fund an expedition to locate the lost city, and perhaps answer  the questions that have plagued her regarding her father's disappearance.  After a harrowing journey with a hastily but well-thought out team, Nora  finally stumbles upon the legendary city...but the thrills only begin  there.  Haunting, chilling, but wildly entertaining...this was definitely a  page-turning adventure!  Plan on staying up till the wee hours to follow  this awesome tale!some tale!	2000-05-01

Irish born, poor, and fatherless, she struggles through her life living hand-to-mouth. Her mother, a devout Catholic and of very ill-health, is never available enough to show Maggie the ways of life, leaving Maggie to  fend for herself.  Unfortunately for Maggie, she takes after her father in  character--he, a wild-eyed drunk who is killed one bleak night when he  stumbles into the path of a passing lorry.  Maggie remembers him as given  to short bouts of heartbreaking tenderness when he wasn't passed out in a  pub somewhere.  Though she tries to please her Mother by being the  &quot;good little Catholic girl&quot;, her reckless side wins out again and  again.  Inevitably, she finds herself pregnant at sixteen and &quot;deep in  her cups&quot;, just like her Father.  The birth of her son, Eion,  doesn't change her much, though it does give her pause more than once to  consider the consequences of her actions...to no avail.  In one fateful  moment, she goes against her better judgement and leaves her then  3-year-old boy alone for a quick afternoon romp with a man who has been  flirting with her for months.  Eion wanders into a pond and drowns.  This,  and the death of her Mother shortly thereafter, sends Maggie into the  darkest time her soul could endure...a vicious, downward spiral. Trying to  escape from her personal guilt and torment, and her loss of faith in God,  she travels to America.  She succumbs to her demons anyway,  unsuccessfully  attempting suicide.  Awaking in a hospital bed, disoriented and confused,  she meets Father Jack Devlin, who sits vigil by her bedside.  Thus begins  Maggie's redemption...and Father Jack's eventual downfall.  Father  Jack becomes Maggie's saving grace, taking her in and turning her life  around.  Father Jack is known for taking in &quot;stray souls&quot; and  giving them a second chance at life.  Eventually, these good-samaritan  gestures come back on him and bite him when one of his former altar boys  makes allegations that involve sexual abuse...and which leads to rumours of  murder.

It would be so easy to write  her off as a disturbed young woman from a troubled and tragic past...but it  is difficult to fault her for reacting to the world in the only way she  knows how...fight.  And the only way she knows how to survive is to fight  to the death.  Unfortunately for those who choose to take her on, it is  their own bloody demise that they meet.  She is not without conscience,  though, and her own violent reactions cause her to flee the only man she  has ever loved, regardless of the fact that she must leave him or draw him  inexorably into her bleak, dangerous world.

Fourteen-year-old Louis Bowman survives  in the housing projects with his mother, a very stubborn and proud woman  who gives new meaning to the phrase &quot;tough love&quot;, and her most  recent &quot;saviour&quot;, a man who becomes Louis' stepfather all too  soon.  They exist within the confining walls of a tenement apartment, one  which comes to resemble a boxing ring, both figuratively and literally.  The three feint and joust their way through their lives, trying hard  to  stay out of one another's path, and yet achieve their dreams and goals.  For each,these are very different, and it becomes survival of the fittest  for all.  Louis, the narrator of this story, soon finds out that life isn't  always easy when it's fight or die...especially when he  begins to feel  emotions that he doesn't understand for the neighborhood  &quot;hoodlum&quot;, Ray Anthony Robinson.  Against the odds, he moves  through his life, managing to keep his sanity intact and not get himself  killed in the process. Wright tells his tale in deft and wholly believable  prose. Not since April Sinclair's &quot;Coffee Will Make You Black&quot;  and &quot;Ain't Gonna Be The Same Fool Twice&quot; has there been a more  poignant coming-of-age story told with  such evocative imagery and lyrical  rhythms.

He's as anchored to his shadow as  his shadow is to him...and it keeps him bobbing only fractions away from  the black depths of certain hell.  If only he could break loose, free  himself of the onerous weight his shadow puts on him. The responsibility.  But, in the hands of Richard Bowes, one is never quite certain who is who  throughout this compelling and nightmarish novel.  At once a novel about  addictions, being gay, and finding ones true self, MINIONS OF THE MOON is  like an acid-flashback one can never escape. Grierson's plight and ultimate  redeeming journey through the Hell's Kitchen (suitably used for the name  alone) of his youth and adulthood takes the reader on one carnival ride  after another.  One never knows whether the shadow is the person or the  person is the shadow.  This is one read that will keep you interested and  intrigued until the very last word.

As his 17-year-old narrator, Evan is a disaffected young man surviving in steamy Florida.  He just meanders his way through his days,  pretending to not care about anything, especially the direction his life is  taking.  He feels completely alienated from his parents, who stopped  speaking months ago and have yet to reestablish communcation, with him, his  runaway older brother, or each other for that matter.  There are weeks when  not one word is spoken within the walls of their house.  One day, while  mowing his parents lawn, he is confronted by a neighbor man who professes  to be in need of his services.  Almost disdainfully, Evan finally  agrees...and the decision is one that cuts him loose from the moors of his  life and sends him drifting aimlessly through a world that he seems to have  no control over.  As he wanders, feeling unwanted and disconnected, the  reader also feels the meandering thoughts and emotions that Evan is  experiencing.  This narrative style gives the story an almost other-worldly  feel, as if we are viewing Evan's world through a distorted lens.  The  story ends without resolution, though one feels that Evan is learning how  to deal with his world and the people in it, if only in self-defense.  I  would recommend this read if only for its narrative styling and beautiful  imagery.  The story itself has been told before, many times.  There is no  new ground covered here.	2000-03-21

Jefferson Morgan thinks that he has seen it all, having been a crime reporter in the Windy City for most of his career.  The lure of the countryside calls though, and he returns to his hometown of Winchester,  Wyoming, with his wife, to settle down in the relative quiet of rural life  in a small town.  It's anything BUT quiet,  he quickly finds out.  He  purchases the towns only newspaper, The Bullet, and is quickly and  unwittingly submersed in the politicking and squabbles that his once-  peaceful town dumps in his lap.  But the most disturbing is a 50-year-old  murder case that rears its spectral head...bringing nothing but grief and  headaches for Morgan and his wife, both of whom are still dealing with the  untimely death of their only son.  When Morgan is approached by a recently  released convict, the man who had confessed to the murder in question 50  years prior, Morgan is suddenly caught up in a tangled web of deceit and  deception.  Franscell deftly portrays life in a small town, and the  quirky nature that life there can take...especially when murder and  cover-up are involved.  His descriptive narrative and strong characters  make the story jump from the page, impressing itself indelibly on the  brain.  It has been a long time since I have found a page-turner such as  this with people so vividly imagined and given life.  I heartily recommend  this to everyone who likes a good read on a dark night!	2000-03-13

As always, I am not easily sold when a book is described by using the talent of another, far better, author, for  comparison.  To compare this reshaping of the legend and myth surrounding  werewolves to Anne Rice's vampire legend is to invite disappointment.  With  that in mind, I delved into this dark and brooding tale.  I was pleasantly  surprised!  Boyd does admirable work in rebuilding the legend of the  werewolf, making them not beastly, unthinking killing machines, but rather,  intelligent and cultured sometime human/sometime animal.  Where Rice's  strenghts lie in her ability to create a chilling and compelling atmosphere  in which to display the predatory side of the human (and non-human) heart,  Boyd builds a more subtle and engrossing comparison of the darker sides of  the human soul.  The Devoncroix, a family that has survived for hundreds of  years, are the forebearers of the werewolf pack, and have used their  unsurpassed intelligence and uncanny overdeveloped senses to survive in a  world where humans believe they are the only race living on the planet.  Building tremendous financial empires at the disadvantage of humans, the  pack desires to rise above the lowly human race by displaying their  more-than-human sensibilities in that they refuse to kill a human under any  circumstances.  Not so humans.  And not so a small group of anarchist  rebels which exists in the frozen tundra of Siberia...they believe that all  humans (except for the few left alive for subservient purposes) should be  eradicated from the planet.  When these two factions clash, brother against  brother, a moral tale arises within which the shades of darkness within the  soul are brought to light.  This tale is well-written, informative, and  definitely entertaining.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for a  good diversion from reality!	2000-03-13

Reading Paul Russell's latest outing (pun unfortunate) is like being drawn into the work of one of the greatest pointillist artists of our time.  One is first captivated by the over-all beauty of the work, its detailed scenes  created by thousands of tiny points of colorful narration, coalescing to  evoke a magnificent and somehow ominous landscape.  As the reader moves  incrementally closer, drawn it seems, against the will, one begins to  determine that each point of color is in itself telling its own story.  In &quot;The Coming Storm&quot;, Russell masterfully does just this.  His  overall rendering of The Forge School, which houses many troubled teenage  boys and equally misguided adults, begins by showing the reader life in  such a secluded and even recluded, private boys school.  Upon the  arrival of Tracy Parker, a charming and charismatic young teacher, and also  the story's pivotal protagonist, one senses the imminent  and inevitable  explosion which draws near.  Russell begins adding layer upon layer of  texture and color, creating an atmosphere that becomes more complex than  one thought possible, it's many possibilities present in every word.  Is it  perhaps the nature of humans to manifest their own past into a malignant  reality, such as Louis Tremper does as the headmaster of the school?  Or is  it the intense yet misplaced affections of Noah Lathrop III, whose  troubling attention to his new teacher, Tracy Parker, brings about a  present that perfectly and tragically invokes the past?  All the  characters in Russell's story are richly painted upon a background of  self-deception, lies, and ultimately redemption. This is going to be one of  the most important literary works of our time.  I highly recommend buying  it!	2000-02-23

Lionel Essrog, aka &quot;Freakshow&quot; to his fellow constituents at the L&amp;L Car Service, a front for the L&amp;L Detective Agency, is the Holden Caulfield of this century--if &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; had  been told by Raymond Chandler instead of Salinger.  This Tourette-riddled  narrator guides the reader, albeit in a loopy and rapid-fire free  association, through his life in Brooklyn.  An orphan boy, though we're  really not certain if even that is true, he is &quot;adopted&quot; by Frank  Minna, an errand runner for unsavory crime figures, and taken under Minna's  wing, despite his &quot;freakshow&quot; qualities.  When Minna is murdered,  Lionel takes it upon himself to find his friends killer.  The journey will  be one not soon forgotten.  Lethem ably and aptly deploys his amazing  writing skills once again in his fifth fiction outing.  After three  consecutive readings, I have chosen this novel as the most important and  best novel I have ever had the (repeated) pleasure of laying my eyes and  hands on.  If you don't read this book, give up reading!	2000-02-15

While the  information that the authors impart in telling this story is somewhat  engaging, the language used felt flat and unimaginative.  Even the  emotional makeup of the lead characters, Jake Donovan and his supporting  crew, seemed as if they were filtered through the same electronic  surveillance devices used by the Agency in gathering evidence.  Had the  story been told with more dynamic flair for the material, it would not have  resembled a walk through a garden papered with cut-out impressions of real  flowers.  The ideas were intriguing, but not enough to carry the idea  through to a satisfying end.  It is as if this book exists primarily to  cash in on the popularity of the science of profiling, as done so well in  &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;.	2000-02-07
