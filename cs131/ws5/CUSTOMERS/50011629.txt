I've always been fascinated by her after seeing publicity stills of her from the mid-1900s. She appeared to be warm, charismatic and fascinating. Her greatest tragedy is that none of her films have been shown in eighty years. I have one of her shorts, \\"Flo's Discipline\\" which only lasts about twelve minutes but it gives you a hint of how dazzling she was before the cameras. While her cohort, Mary Pickford, went onto a spectacular career that included mind-boggling salaries and a world-famous Hollywood castle, Pickfair, poor Lawrence was living in a small, hotel room, being paid a few dollars a week as an extra at MGM. Her life would make a wonderful movie--and a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of how fleeting fame is, and how fickle is the public when it comes to remaining faithful to the flavor of the month.	2005-06-23

In the same month of that year, Jonathan Coleman published his big, non-fiction study, \\"At Mother's Request,\\" of the same shocking crime. Of the two, Coleman's book far surpasses Alexander's on several levels. Coleman appears to have interviewed and investigated every major and minor figure involved in this case where a psychopathic mother orders her son to kill her wealthy, plain-living father. More importantly, he includes lots of dramatic photographs of the murderous Mom, her two psychotic sons and the major players in this bigger-than-life tragedy. Alexander doesn't include a single photograph. She and a few other true crime writers appear to have this lofty idea that pictures should be included in lurid, paperback true-crime stories only because books like her's are too big and important to cater to the plebians. I keep harping on this lack of pictures because I think it greatly dilutes a major source of information and enjoyment for readers. Your imagination can only fill in the blanks so far. I dearly love to curl up with a big, thick nonfiction crime book and Coleman's is the one you'll find me with on a wintry weekend. Alexander's book is okay but unsatisfying. Yet, it was her book that became the source of a wildly popular TV miniseries back in the 80s.	2005-01-04

Nobody does it better than Ann Coulter! She uses words like bullets, cutting through polite and civilized posturings and politically correct posing. In this book, she carries on her heady and exhilirating tradition of her last book, \\"Treason.\\" Coulter pulls no punches, when it comes to decontructing the myriad of conceits of self-styled liberals. She pulls way the window dressing to reveal the extreme liberals for what they are: rabid do-gooders who refuse to listen to another person's viewpoints. Don't get me wrong!

I agree with other readers that there was too much space given to the father, Leonard Boudin, an intense, civil rights attorney, who specialized in representing the radical left. So it's not surprising that his daughter, Kathy Boudin, became a radical protestor of the Vietnam War and a loud, snarling member of the Weather Underground. While other members of this pathetic group finally threw in the towel and turned themselves into the law after careers as bombers, killers and trouble-makers, Kathy Boudin stuck it out. You read in horrified fascination how she became a key member of the killers who murdered two police officers in a foiled Brinks truck armed robbery. Even behind bars for 21 years, she played the role of wronged martyr. I remember during the sixties, when the Weather Underground was at its peak of fury. My college roommate dubbed them, The Marx Brothers of Terrorism. He hit the nail on the head. No one knew really what these rich, wealthy white kids were protesting. None had ever worked anywhere in their lives. Even when they supposedly went underground, their wealthy parents and friends supported them and gave them safe houses. Yet, you caught occasional glimpses of them on television as they shrieked and cursed and acted like lunatics. In their own pathetic little reality, they dramatized themselves as great revolutionaries who would foment a nation wide revolution to destroy America's values. No one knew what they wanted to replace them with.	2004-10-26

Bill Ayers fondly recalls those wondrous days of blowing up the Pentagon, trying to murder and blow up the \\"pigs\\" and other innocents who didn't share his beliefs or those of his fellow pychos. Ayers and his ilk came from wealthy, white-bread families and this was a chance for them to dramatize their poor, boring lives by pretending to be social outlaws. Protected by money and other kindred rich and air-headed brats, the Underground zanies created their own theatrical reality--where they were bravely trying to destroy the \\"white man's\\" society and liberate all those poor little welfare people. Ayers rationalizes this behavior by centering his theme on the trauma of the Vietnam war. He justifies his eager and nutty attempts to murder and maim innocent Americans by inner rage at America and the War. Millions of others were also frustrated by many issues in those days but they didn't attempt to blow up and destroy symbols and people. What's scary is that Bill Ayers is now a Distinguished Professor at the University of Illinois. His fellow former terrorist, Bernardine Dorn, is now his wife. What a couple! What they tried to do back in their glory days was accomplished by terrorists Sept. 11, 2001. To paraphrase an old New York saying, \\"only in America, kids. Only in America.\\"	2004-10-15

Even if you're a skeptic or the cynical, this is a fascinating non-fiction book you should read. Charles Berlitz &quot;The Bermuda Triangle&quot; that came out during the seventies is still one of my favorite studies of this mysterious and sinister area of the sea. In &quot;Beyond the Bermuda Triangle&quot; the author brings us the latest mysteries and bizarre events in the Triangle--all backed up by scrupulous research and investigation. With brilliant daring, the author also correlates some of the mystery to our universe and the real secret of UFOs. He weaves all of this together in fascinating detail. The fact that hundreds of ships and planes have mysteriously vanished since the first &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; appeared in the seventies should chill us all. And wonder what is behind this everyday nightmare.	2004-03-26

The author attempts to explain this Vassar educated American woman who became a Russian spy, but Bently still remains a vague phantom. Since I'm fascinated by that whole period--of Joe McCarthy, Alger Hiss, the shocking presence of real-life commnists in American government back in the 30s and 40s--I found this book very readable. You might also enjoy related books, especially Ann Coulter's best-selling, &quot;Treason,&quot; which really delivers the goods about how the Communist scare of the 40s and 50s was not the imaginary fear of paranoid Americans. It really was something to cause genuine fear. Elizabeth Bently revealed just have intensive this spy network was.	2004-02-20

Coulter made me rethink my whole concept of McCarthyrism. Consequently, I've been reading all the books she mentions regarding Joe McCarthy's destruction and the elevation of Soviet Agent Alger Hiss to martydom.

So were stupid white liberal males. They thought they were really being daring. Most of us outgrew this embarassing phase. Michael Moore never did. He sounds a lot like fakey civil right activists who are also good at blaming Stupid White American Males for everything wrong with the world. If there's an earthquake, it's the fault of STupid White American Guys. Moore is more than repulsively hypocritical. He likes to project this naughty, shambling,good old boy, scruffy and impish. In real life, he lives in a penthouse apartment and has a chaffeured limousin at his beck and call. He's grown rich from Stupid White Book Buyers who can't tell when they've been suckered.	2003-10-28

This is the first book I've read by Andrea D'Allasandra but it was a real scare-fest! The l3 stories are fresh, off-beat and each has a shocker of a ending. Like \\"X-Files\\" or \\"Twilight Zone\\" stuff. The l3 women in each story are so totally believable and when that horrible mother in 'Stay Away, Little Girl' finally got her's at the end, I whooped and cheered. Many of these stories take place in Wilmington, N.C., a place I've visited many times. The author recreates this place so vividly. Another story I enjoyed was the last one, 'The Haunted House'and I've seen houses like this one. The story that really jolted me was 'Deadly Pick-up.'

I began my love affair with &quot;We the Living&quot; back in the fifties and read it several times each year. My attitude toward Kira Argounova, however, has changed drastically as I've grown older. She represented a fascinating, fearless heroine who stood alone against a brutal world. But then I began to wonder why did she give up everything for the sadistic, beautiful Leo while delbirately destroying the only heroic character in the book: Andrei? Through the book, Kira arrogantly insists that nothing is greater than a person's ego. Yet, she becomes hot for the body of the Russian god, Leo, and goes crazy over him. Leo belongs with Rand's gallery of villians and I would definitely put Kira Argounova in there with them. She destroyed a noble, intense young Russian warrior in order to keep her sleazy hunk alive. There's nothing admirable or noble in what she does. She would fit in with the hookers on 42nd Street here in NYC.	2003-06-18

About 600 pages but it's double-spaced, like it's published for the hard-to-see. Anyway, I couldn't put this one down. The violence and sex are graphic but then it's not exploitive. I mean, the plot line calls for very explicit sex and gore. The author has done a great job of creating a small world, within a remote mountain chalet, and inhabiting it with people so real you're tempted to grab a butcher knife or rifle to protect yourself. You might say this thriller is saturated with terror, sensuality and violence and I would definitely say that Andrea D'Allasandra has knocked into the ballpark a sizzling, sexy thriller that you won't soon forget. You'll definitely NOT forget the psycho villain--Billy Mulligan. Despite all the horrible things he does, I still wanted to spend some quality time with him--just so he was manacled and chained to the wall.

Kira sacrifices her dignity and helps the Soviets kill the only true hero in the book: Andrei. She does this in the name of love for the sleazy, brutal Leo. I can't see anything admirable about this sadistic killer. Kira becomes like any teeny-bopper and can't keep her hands off this muscular hunk. so much for the high ideals of our heroine. Other than that, \\"We the Living\\" is a masterpiece. You owe to yourself to see the Italian made film of this book.

Since I worked as an aide in a mental hospital in Asheville, N.C. back in the 60s, I came across a few patients who would certainly follow the mind-set of the killer.

Must Read	I had just finished reading Fury's novel, HIs Eyes Were Dark, He Licked His lips, when I grabbed this one. Wow! There're 20 or more stories, each one with a shocking ending. The action takes place in a scary place called Wintersville. Fury makes the backdrop as important as the doomed gay heroes of these stories. My favorite was the last one, &quot;He's Out There!&quot; with a great Alfred Hithcock ending. If gay sex bothers you, then forget about this book. If you're into great writing, with strong plots and scary story lines, then you should grab this one. Better in many ways than Fury's Eric's Body.	2001-02-04

It offers a fascinating look at the life of movie extras, while the backdrops are the making of &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Gone With the  Wind&quot;, etc. Three gay men struggle to make it big and only one  succeeds. Terrific dish about the scandals and you meet Bette Davis,  Crawford, Garbo, GAble, etc. Haunting and poignant ending. This would make  a fantastic movie with Tom Cruise or Brendan Frasier portraying bad-good  guy, Eddie Bostic; Jude Law doing Sunny St. James and some handsome,  incredibly well-built guy who portray the amazing Mack Johnson. Anyone into  nostalgia for the 30s, especially the movies, this one is definitely for  you.	2000-03-22

Jason Fury, probably the most enigmatic of current authors, weaves a haunting, intensely sensual  spell with each of the 23 stories included. My favorite was &quot;Forbidden  Fruit&quot; which studies the surreal relationship between Fury and a  mental patient. EVen better is &quot;Miracle on 55th Street&quot; were  Jason is a star stripper who has an affair with a young cop. Why Fury  hasn't published anymore stories is a mystery and tragedy. Bravo to gay  erotica's very own Colette.	2000-03-20

Wow! this book has got everything--three swinging guys in Hollywood during the 30s, their loves, tragedies, triumphs. Jason Fury has long been a favorite author of mine. In this one, he's greater than ever! The men are  gay, so if that alone turns you off, then you might skip it. But for the  more broad-minded, this is a trip. You meet Davis and Garbo and Gable and  Crawford, terrific dish about who was doing who between takes of Gone With  the Wind, King Kong, etc. A must-have for any fan of old Hollywood and for  those who enjoy a panaromic look of the film colony. You'll laugh, cry,  love it!	2000-02-22
