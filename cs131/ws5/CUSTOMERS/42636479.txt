US	42636479	R3BZY54S42GVB	1416509801	942415879	Fantastic Four	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Read this 'Four' a 'Fantastic' 'Reed', excuse all the puns..	*STORY* - A crew of four men and a woman go on a scientific trip to space into the center of a cosmic storm; perhaps to somehow unlock the secrets of the human gentic code. However, things go teribly wrong when the cosmic storm moves at an astonishingly acclerating rate. The cosmic radiation changes and mutates their DNA... changing their very lives and future. <br /> <br />*CHARACTERS* - Here are brief sketches of the characters from the book and upcoming summer movie for the year 2005... <br /> <br />Dr. Reed Richard (Mr. Fantastic) - A scientific genius whose ultimately problem is thinking too much before taking any action, Reed inevitably becomes the leader of what will become the Fantastic4. His new powers enables him to stretch and contort his body into any shape. <br /> <br />Susan Storm (Invisible Girl) - Reed's ex-girlfriend who still harbors feeling for the scientist while continually being frustrated by him, has the power to make herself become invisible and create force fields. <br /> <br />Ben Grimm (The Thing) - Reed's best friend and former astronaut-from-Brooklyn, he's known for his surly manner and dry humor. The radiation mutated him into a rock-like, superhumanly stronge 'thing'. <br /> <br />Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) - Sue's hotheaded younger brother, he's known for chasing thrills (not to mention the ladies...). His abilites include engulfing his body into flames and flying. <br /> <br />Victor Von Doom (Doctor Doom) - The financier for the whole expidition into space, he is Reed's long time rival who is now a billionaire industrialist. Though many believed him to have been kept safe from the radiation, he actually did not escape the 'incident' unscathes and unchanged... <br /> <br />*REVIEW* - \\"Fantastic4\\" was a very, VERY enjoyable read, one which I could not put down without wanting to pick it back up again. I was quite impressed with Peter David's writing; he chooses his words well, using every 'cliche' so uniquely that it's quite novelto read about the 'solid' Ben Grimm, 'smoking' Johnny Storm, and etc. <br /> <br />As the other reviewer commented, some of the 'physical' humor/action is slightly awkward to read at times, Johnny's ski 'trip' coming most to mind. I'm sure that on screen it would come off better (hopefully). <br /> <br />On the other hand, the book gives much more details which I know for a fact that will never be portrayed well in the movie. Peter David gives a nice insight into the minds of each of the characters, most especially that of Ben Grimm. The turmoil in him from being 'the Thing' is well written.  <br /> <br />*CLOSING* - I was quite impressed with the novel and though like many of the recent movies F4 has a lot of action, some even 'unnecessary' to some degree, I am looking forward to the character development, if well done, could make this on par with the likes of superhero movie giants, \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\".	2005-06-15
US	42636479	R2R210KH29THMQ	0553573918	765635327	The Icarus Hunt	Books	5	10	10	N	N	"The Icarus Hunt"; a Timothy Zahn masterpiece!	All I can say is that Timothy Zahn is perhaps among the best sci-fi authors out there, next to Isaac Asimov. His stories are all complex and detailed, the plot jampacked with twists, turns, surprises, and shockers. \\"The Icarus Hunt\\" is certainly no exception. <br /> <br />\\"The Icarus Hunt\\"'s main character is Jordan McKell, a star-freighter pilot who plays the role of a poor yet honest private contracter, considering that in reality he is a smuggler working for a huge crime organization. Things couldn't get worse he supposed. Or so he thought...  <br />When he takes a job flying a strangely put-together antique ship called the 'Icarus' with a ragtag crew, little does he know that he has just landed himself in the middle of a huge conspiracy. Jordan is immediately thrust into events spiraling out of control: one of the crew is murdered, his employer seems to have disappeared, an unknown saboteur is on board, and the 'Icarus' is being wanted by the oppresive Patth who have monopolized all trade in the galaxy.  <br />It's up to Jordan and his mechanic partner Ixil, a Kalixiri with his two ferret 'outhunters' Pix and Pax, to figure out what's going on while struggling to stay alive. The hunt for the 'Icarus' is on! <br /> <br />If you thought my summary was complicated, wait until you actually pick up the book! There are so many other subplots that are too numerous too count and besides, most of them are the twists and turns this book has to offer. But though seemingly 'complicated', Zahn's expertise is put to use as he deftly weaves a tale with numerous 'threads' yet makes up one intricately woven 'tapestry'. There is not one moment where the action and suspense slows down; instead, we are taken on a ride where you have no clue where it'll end! <br /> <br />Though written in first-person from Jordan McKell's point of view, Zahn carefully makes sure we don't know 'everything'. We do get to know most of Jordan's thoughts and theories, but there's still plenty of mysteryfor you to try to figure out on your own. There are lots of stories where there's such a huge build up but at the end falls flat on it's face; fortunately, \\"The Icarus Hunt\\" is not the case. The ending is just one big surprise though if you think about it, you could have seen it coming. That again is one of Zahn's talents; in that he give you so many clues, theories, details, and little surprises, you can't tell what to expect! <br /> <br />Unlike many of Zahn's other stories, \\"The Icarus Hunt\\" has a large dose of humor in the story. Jordan McKell's character is very sarcastic and is quite the cynic, and has a dry sense of humor which I enjoy a lot. One of my favorite part is: <br /> <br />\\"For a change, Lady Luck seemed to be smiling on me. Then again, maybe the fickle wench was just lulling me into a false sense of security while she reached for a rock.\\" <br /> <br />Those two sentences sums up Jordan's character perfectly. ^_^ <br /> <br />To sum up, \\"The Icarus Hunt\\" is something I can highly recommend to all readers who enjoys a good mix of sci-fi, mystery, suspense, action, and humor. Other good Timothy Zahn books include \\"The Cobra Trilogy\\", \\"The Thrawn Trilogy\\", and \\"The Conquerors Trilogy\\". Now, all I can say is, when are any of Zahn's books gonna be made into a movie? Now THAT is a film I'd enjoy watching if they stay true to his work!	2004-11-22

I am an absolute lover of the Lord of the Rings books, not to mention the movies. I have used the two previous versions of this student planner, so I was so pleased to see them come out with another planner for this school year! This student planner is a terrific addition to my Lord of the Rings collection. One of the best things about this student planner must be mentioned, which are the wonderful photographs!  <br /> <br />This is a 12 month student planner, 7.30\\" x 8.86\\", and is wire-o bound. Includes: <br />*GENERAL INFORMATION* - Insert your general info. <br />*EMERGENCY INFORMATION* - Insert you emergency info. <br />*YEAR-AT-A-GLANCE PAGE* - Includes all special dates. <br />*CLASS SCHEDULE* - Fill in class schedules for the 5 school days, including space for the times for the 7 classes. There are 4 blank schedules for the four school quarters. <br />*WEEKLY PLANNER* - Plenty of large movie stills from the hit-movie and plenty of room to put all information you need to write down.  <br />*GRADE KEEPER* - Put in your grades for up to 11 subjects, includes a chart on 'Grade Point Average'. <br />*COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS* - 45 sets of commonly misused words. <br />*WEIGHTS & MEASURES* - A complete chart for both the Metric System and the U.S. Customary System. <br />*CONVERSIONS* - I must say this will be VERY helpful to me! Seems very complete. <br />*COMMONLY MISSPELLED WORDS* - 321 different words. <br />*ADDRESS/PHONE* - 2-pages to fill with friend's and family's info. <br />*BIRTHDAYS & SPECIAL OCCASIONS* - Fill in special events and their dates. <br />*NOTES* - Only 1 page to fill with your notes. I had hoped there would be more. <br /> <br />One thing is that there is some sort of confusion about the front cover. In Amazon it shows the picure of Legolas and Gimli on a horse, while my front cover is the main poster used to promote \\"The Return of the King\\". Ineither case, both are spectacular pictures. The whole book is in beautiful faded parchment colors of light brown and yellowish brown. All pages have the faded background of the White Tree of Gondor and a red vine edge near the center. All of this gives the book a beautiful touch. The pictures are not particularily clear images but are given a textured effect. <br /> <br />Only one complaint... there are no pictures of Faramir! I mean, even Galadriel gets a full page picture, why doesn't Faramir? *sniff sniff*	2004-10-15

Net Force Explorer Megan O'Malley and her friend Wilma Christensen become worried when they discover that their equestrian teammate and Wilma's boyfriend, Burt Kamen, disappears. Fortunately they find him at a combined online-offline refuge for 'runaways'. Burt reveals his reason for leaving is that his home life had become more than he could handle. How can he feel at home when his parents can't stand him? But Meg becomes suspicious hearing that Burt has gotten a job. What kind of employer would hire a runaways and troubled kids? And what kind of job? As Meg digs deeper, she finds that things are not exactly what they seem. Calling in reinforcements Leif Anderson and Mark Gridley, it's up to the three Net Force Explorers to discover what is really going on...<br />I'm a BIG fan of the Net Force Explorers series! The NFE series are a great Young Adult fiction series, especially those with a love for computers and the Internet. Since the Net presented in the books have no boundaries, you will never know what to expect next. But there IS one thing you can come to expect: stories that have plenty of twists and turns, having the whole plot well balanced with mystery, excitement, and adventure. And sometimes, there's a good romance! The Net Force Explorers include Matt Hunter, Megan O'Malley, Leif Anderson, Andy Moore, Mark Gridley, David Gray, Maj Greene, Caitlin Murray, and P.J. Farris. Occasionally other characters are introduced though they show up rarely.<br />It's too bad though that \\"Runaways\\" is the last book of the series. I hope they continue to publish more of the series! My only problem with this book is that it's a bit short, only 184 pages. Not only that, I felt that the first chapter was a bit unnecessary to the plot. Otherwise, the plot was interesting. I especially liked it that Leif gets to show-off his language abilities. None of the other books have really shown the extent of his talents in languages.  <br />The series is for Young Adults and I strongly recommend only older kids since at times the computer and Net 'talk' is a bit confusing and hard for younger kids to understand. And there are some minor profanities in the book. I can highly recommend the whole series!	2003-08-22

Though still worried about his condition, the Council decides to finally send him on a new mission. Obi-Wan Kenobi is relieved to be on an assignment, but wonders if his master can handle it. They travel to the planet of Frego to find then escort witness Lena Cobral back to Coruscant. Since because her testimony could bring the downfall of an evil crime family on the planet, the Jedi must ensure her safety. The mission was supposed to be an easy one. Unfortunately, the two Jedi must keep their wits about them as they must try to distinguish truth from lies.<br />\\"The Only Witness\\" is book 17 of the 18 Jedi Apprentice books. Sadly, I must say that this book is one of the weakest stories of the whole series. The plot was interesting but never has the climaxes, twists and turns we have come to expect from Jude Watson. The whole first part of the story is not that intriguing though fortunately the ending was very well done. On the plus side to the story, Jude Watson vividly and beautifully writes down Qui-Gon's emotion and grief on paper exceptionally well. Obi-Wan's character is also well-written, his confusion and helplessness in giving support to his Master is expressed to the reader without feeling overdone. On the downside though, I just couldn't really like the character of Lena Cobral very much. She's very much of an uneven character, and I just couldn't keep up with her changes from a strong, noble woman to a weak and emotional one. Ah well, I just guess I've been spoiled from all the previous books. :-) I still do recommend Jedi Apprentice fans to read this book, for first timers, I suggest you read from the very first book then work up through the whole series.<br />A bit of info on the whole Jedi Apprentice Series. This series explains a lot about how Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan first meet. Their beginning is far from simple and all smooth-sailings, which would be pretty monotonous if it was. Though the books are said for ages 9-12, like many other reviewers I agree that the Jedi Apprentice Series are for anybody. Extremely well-written, the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of the main characters are very well put down into words. I also like the different array of humans and aliens which are portrayed, both good and bad. <br />Plus check out the new Jedi Quest series, dealing with the master and apprentice duo of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Another Star Wars Series I recommend and like a lot are the Young Jedi Knights series. The stories are about Jacen and Jaina Solo (twins of Han and Leia Solo), and their friends as they journey on the road to becoming Jedi Knights. More on the teenager level of reading. For adult readings, a few selections I enjoy reading are \\"The Thrawn Trilogy\\", \\"Rogue Planet\\", \\"The Jedi Academy Trilogy\\", \\"The Corellian Trilogy\\", and \\"The Truce at Bakura\\".	2003-08-22

Sixteen-year-old orphan Nicola Sparks has just finished her schooling at a young lady's academy. She's ready for her first London Season and though other young girls would be searching for a husband, Nicola's not worried. She has already decided she will marry the young and handsome viscount, Lord Sebastian Bartholomew. She loves poetry, he loves poetry. And he seems to be as much in lover with her as she is with him. So Nicola feels everything is going well when Lord Sebastian proposes to her. That is, until Nathaniel Sheridan, Nicola's best friend's brother, questions the viscount's character and motivation in marrying her. Nicola is convinced though that Nathaniel is just making pointless accusations. But, what if Nathaniel is right, and Lord Sebastian has an ulterior motive for marrying her? It's up to Nicola is piece together the facts and find the truth, and to also search her heart to figure out who she really is in love with...    <br />The fifth book of the series, \\"Nicola and the Viscount\\" is an Avon True Romance for teenage girls. And even though this book is first and foremost a romance novel, there is plenty of intrigue, humor, and excitement to entertain a variety of teens.<br />Nicola is a very interesting character, far from being perfect. I thought that Meg Cabot made Nicola's fascination and infatuation with the viscount very realistic. It's very often that many young woman mistake love with a physical attraction. Yes, Lord Sebastian was handsome but it was not until later on that Nicola truly poses the important questions. Besides his physical appearance, what dis she REALLY love about him? As we go through the book, we can see a change come through Nicola as she realizes that the truth is that she and the viscount had very little in common. Then there's Nathaniel who's such a tease and much like an annoying brother, but later on Nicola comes to realize that they just might be perfect for each other. The ending is so sweet and I assure you that you'll like it!<br />If all the other Avon True Romance novels for teens are anything like \\"Nicola and the Viscount\\", I'm definitely picking up another in the series! So far, \\"Catherine and the Pirate\\" and \\"Victoria and the Rogue\\" are my favorites.	2003-08-10

His half brother, Richard, is bitterly upset for he had expected to become the next duke. But in the company of Richard's fiance, Anna Welsley, Ewan finds himself falling in love. Anna herself is drawn towards the handsome half English/Scottish Ewan for she is facing a form of dissatisfaction in the arrangement marriage with Richard. But the plot thickens when it becomes clear that Richard is conspiring against Ewan. Will Anna and Ewan stop him before it's too late?  <br />The third book of the series, \\"Anna and the Duke\\" is an Avon True Romance for teenage girls. And even though this book is first and foremost a romance novel, there is plenty of intrigue, humor, and excitement to entertain a variety of teens.<br />The only Avon True Romance for teens that I read is so far \\"Victoria and the Rogue\\". In that book the story had been told in the view of the main character Victoria, who was a young, naive, and a bit haughty young woman. In \\"Anna and the Duke\\", I was given a totally different type of young lady. Anna Welsley was in a way more ladylike and had a shy temperament. But in no way she can be thought of as a boring, 'perfect' girl which plagues many romance novels of late. Anna has her faults but is strong and brave enough to fight for her loved one. Her loved one is Ewan MacLaughlin who is perfectly charming! I loved his background of being Scottish which is pretty cool.<br />If all the other Avon True Romance novels for teens are anything like \\"Anna and the Duke\\", I'm definitely picking up another in the series!	2003-08-09

Kearney is determined to find his father's killer, because it is now obvious that McRaven had been murdered. But it seems that Kearney must also solve the myster of his father's shadowy past, a past which involves killers who will do anything to keep a startling secret.<br />I just love Louis L'Amour's westerns! With plenty of intrigue, suspense, action, and romance, for any L'Amour fan this is a must read. One of the best things I like about this book is the mystery. I love mysteries and &quot;The Proving Trail&quot; is very much a page-turner. I could hardly put it down so I finished the book in record time. L'Amour also as usual puts a lot into his characters. Characters like Kearney McRaven, Felix Yant, Laurie McCrae, Billy Jenkins, Ben Blocker and more. L'Amour wonderfully displays the different types of people who made up the American frontier.<br />Other L'Amour books I highly recommend are: All of the Sackett books, including my most favorites, &quot;Jubal Sackett&quot; and &quot;Galloway, &quot;Westward the Tide&quot; &quot;North to the Rails&quot;, &quot;Broken Gun&quot;, &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot;, and &quot;Comstock Lode&quot;.	2003-08-08

A page turner, \\"Gameprey\\" has in my opinion the most action put in any of the Net Force Explorers Series. Another point in \\"Gameprey\\"'s favor is that ALL of the NFEs are in this book! From my favorite characters Leif, the smartest NFE Mark, to the jokester Andy, everyone's involved in this mystery. Another interesting aspect in the book is that we're given the viewpoints of the bad guys, too though Maj Greene is the main character. <br />The series is for Young Adults and I strongly recommend only older kids since at times the computer and Net 'talk' is a bit confusing and hard for younger kids to understand. I can highly recommend the whole series! <br />One little thing, though VERY small. There's a typo on page 125, around the upper middle half of the page.

She's haughty, a bit unlady-like, a bit innocent, and controlling of other. Doesn't sound much of a character you'd like, huh? But in actuality, her character was for me totally fascinating. As I was reading the book, I kept looking forward to having someone put her in her place and teach her what it means to love.<br />And of course this character is Jacob Carstairs. Absolutely the kind of guy you'd dream about! I thought him very charming (though his collar points is a good two inches belowed the required height, clearly a crime against 1810 London fashion). He's certainly the perfect match for Victoria. I must congratulate Meg Cabot in her style of writing. She's staying with the usual 'formula' for romance novels, yet gives a feeling of experiencing something new.<br />If all the other Avon True Romance novels for teens are anything like \\"Victoria and the Rogue\\", I'm definitely picking up another in the series!	2003-08-06

Some mutants want to strike out against mankind, these mutants being led by the powerful Magneto. But then again, there are some mutants who uses their special abilities for the greater. They battle against prejudice and agents of intolerance to save mankind, these mutants are the X-Men. But now there is a new enemy whose cunning and evil plan may lead to the destruction of all mutants and until the enemy is stopped, no one is safe...<br />First off I would like to say that I've never been an X-Men fan, never even have read any of the comics. It was only recently that I saw the movie \\"X-Men\\", read the first X-Men novelization, then saw \\"X-2\\". I found the movies a totally must-see experience! So naturally I wanted to pick up the novelization. A great read I must say!<br />Compared to the first movie novelization by Kristine Kathryn Rusch, \\"X-Men 2\\" was written with a better style. Instead of focusing on just one main character, Chris Claremont delves into each and every character, from the main X-men characters to the small characters of the soldiers or police involved. The action is put into words with great care, neither hunkering it down with too many details nor shortening the action into boring little incidents. <br />The only major problem with this book is the ending which I'm sure other reviewers have mentioned. What exactly had happened? It's totally different from the movie! My only question is, what's going to happen when X-3 comes out, which it inevitably will. Since the movie and book endings are different, how is the X-3 movie novelization going to turn out.   <br />Overall, I can highly recommend this book for all \\"X-Men\\" or \\"X-Men 2\\" movie fans. I'm not sure if \\"X-Men\\" comics fans might enjoy this, since I don't know if the characters are very different from the comics. The movie was rated PG-13 so I guess this book is more for older teens and adults because of some swearing, violence, and sexual innuendos.	2003-07-21
US	42636479	RE077AH81OGMA	006440966X	374371506	The Two Princesses of Bamarre	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Way to go, Gail Carson Levine!	After being enchanted by \\"Ella Enchanted\\", I knew I had to pick up Gail Carson Levin's \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\". And I must say that I found this fairy tale to be quite a fascinating read!<br />Princess Medryl can't wait to be grown up so she can leave the castle, why? So she can have all sorts of adventures fighting off the evil monsters which roam the land of Bamarre. On the other hand though, her sister Princess Adelina, called Addie, is afraid just of the thought of adventures. She's afraid of spiders and rats, how can she face down dragons, specters, gryphons, or ogres? More than anything though, she is afraid to lose her sister to whom she depends on for courage and strength. But in the year Addie turns sixteen, Merlyn is stricken by the fatal Gray Death. It's up to Princess Addie to save her sister and find a cure. But the quest will be dangerous and she will have to face her deepest fears. Will Addie be able to fidn the cure before time runs out for both her and her sister?<br />For a Young Adult fairy-tale, this story cotains it tall: an exciting plot, fun characters lots of daring adventures, magic, monsters in the forms of dragons and other creatures, and a sweet romance. Totally worth the read!<br />Levine's characters as usual are lovable and fun to read about. Especially the main characters Addie who is sweet and charming. In the typcal writing style of Levine, we are given a first-person view of Addie's character. And typical for Levine, this view does not get boring not even once because of Levine's sense of humor which keeps her characters lively and interesting. <br />Mostly for young girls 10 and up, this book can still be read by older teens (I'm sixteen and I still enjoy these books for fun!). So if you have a chance, pick up \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\". Here are two other books by Gail Carson Levine I also recommend:<BR>*ELLA ENCHANTED* ~ If I were to choose between this book and \\"The Two Princesses...\\", I might veer towards liking this book more. A Cinderella like story with a fun twist, this book is a Newberry honor award. 5 stars easily!<BR>*THE WISH* ~ The story of a girl who wishes for popularity and learns an important lesson about what true popularity is. Not really up to par with \\"Ella Enchanted\\" and \\"The Two Princesses...\\" (not many books are), but still is a cute story to read.	2003-07-18

The Soviets have build the submarine, the Red October. Deadly and almost silent with a new propulsion system, commandeered by Captain Marko Ramius, the Red October is heading West. The reason? It's up to the Americans to find out.  At first, the American government immediately jump to the conclusion that the Russians are planning to attack the United States. But then strangely enough, they find out that the entire Russian naval and air commands are trying to find the &quot;Red October&quot;: there orders, to sink the submarine! Lone CIA analyst, Jack Ryan has a different idea that is almost too impossible to believe! The hunt is on!!<br />Now this is a book worth the reading! Not only is the book a suspensful and thrilling read, the plot is so well constructed that it's almost impossible to believe that this never really took place. Down to the last detail, Tom Clancy gives us a story which will have your eyes glued to every single page and make the time fly past.<br />Clancy's characters are fully developed and I'm most thankful for that. There are times when I read a very detailed book with so many characters, and even while reading, I forget the characters and have to turn back to find out 'who in the world is that?' But not so in this case, From the main characters, Jack Ryan, Marko Ramius, the President, and etc., I still can probably start reading the book again and remember most of the characters. <br />When you finish this book, I can most definitely guarantee it won't leave you feeling disappointed. But don't stop there! Tom Clancy is the author of many more novels which will give you the same feeling of delving into some sort of hidden story waiting to be opened up. Also, be sure to check out the 1990 movie based on this book:<br />&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990) - Basically the same as the book. Understandably though, not all the characters, incidents, and details aren't included in the movie. Still a greatmovie, I can highly recommend it. Starring Sean Connery, Alec Baldwin, Scott Glenn.

(I know it seems early but if I can get my hands on anything LOTR, I get it!) I am an absolute lover of the Lord of the Rings books, not to mention the movies. I used to have &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring Studen Planner 2002-2003&quot; so I was so pleased to see them come out with another planner for this school year! This student planner is a terrific addition to my Lord of the Rings collection. One of the best things about this student planner must be mentioned, which are the wonderful photographs! <br />This is a 12 month student planner, 7.30&quot; x 8.86&quot;, and is wire-o bound. Includes:<BR>*GENERAL INFORMATION* - Insert your general info.<BR>*EMERGENCY INFORMATION* - Insert you emergency info.<BR>*YEAR-AT-A-GLANCE PAGE* - Includes all special dates.<BR>*CLASS SCHEDULE* - Fill in class schedules for the 5 school days, including space for the times for the 7 classes. There are 4 blank schedules for the four school quarters.<BR>*WEEKLY PLANNER* - Plenty of large movie stills from the hit-movie and plenty of room to put all information you need to write down. <BR>*GRADE KEEPER* - Put in your grades for up to 11 subjects, includes a chart on 'Grade Point Average'.<BR>*COMMONLY MISUSED WORDS* - 45 sets of commonly misused words.<BR>*WEIGHTS &amp; MEASURES* - A complete chart for both the Metric System and the U.S. Customary System.<BR>*CONVERSIONS* - I must say this will be VERY helpful to me! Seems very complete.<BR>*COMMONLY MISSPELLED WORDS* - 321 different words.<BR>*ADDRESS/PHONE* - 2-pages to fill with friend's and family's info.<BR>*BIRTHDAYS &amp; SPECIAL OCCASIONS* - Fill in special events and their dates.<BR>*NOTES* - Only 1 page to fill with your notes. I had hoped there would be more.<br />The front cover of the student planner is from &quot;The Two Towers&quot; poster, the one wear Frodo is clutching the One Ring in his hand. The wholebook is in a beautiful faded parchment brown color. All pages have either faded backgrounds of maps from Middle-Earth or Elvish writing. All of this gives the book a beautiful touch. The pictures look like they were taken off of old parchments, giving a terrific effect.	2003-07-06

The fifth book of the O'Malley series, \\"The Healer\\" will just captivate you! And if you've read all three books and loved them as much as I do, I'm sure you feel a part of the O'Malley family now!<br />The O'Malley family consists of seven brothers and sister, three boys and four girls. Since they were little they had been in the same orphanage and when they got out of the orphanage, they decided to 'adopt' each other, taking the name O'Malley as their family name. They all have very important jobs, Marcus is a U.S. Marshal, Kate a negotiator for hostage situations, botched-up robberies, etc., Jennifer is a doctor, Jack a fireman, Stephen a paramedic, Rachel a trauma psychologist, and Lisa is a forensic pathologist. This story is about Rachel O'Malley, 'the healer'.<br />Rachel O'Malley by the faith and prayers of her family is now a Christian. But being a trauma psychologist is a tense and stressful job. Working at disasters for the Red Cross, trying to heal the lives of children torn apart by parent's divorces, Rachel finds it hard at times to trust in Jesus to help her let go of the hurt she sees. <br />Captain Cole Parker, captain of a fire company who has spent the last few years fighting fires and trying to stop arsons. A devout Christian from a young age, Cole sticks by Rachel and helps her through the hard times. It is inevitable that they become closer, even reaching the point of falling in love.<br />But in the midst of Rachel of having to deal with the fact she might lose her sister Jennifer to cancer, tragedy strikes. When Rachel's sister Lisa O'Malley discovers a murder scene discovered in a flooded community, it is suspected that there may be a second victim. Things become worse when there is gunfire at a local school. Children are injured, children are dead, and what's so terrible is that the shooters were children. But the mystery begins when one of the bullets matches the one which had killed the victim in the flood. And that gun has disappeared. What is going on, how are the two cases connected? Rachel, Cole, and the O'Malley's must race to find the missing gun, before tragedy repeats...<br />Of all the books, I think that \\"The Healer\\" is one of the weakest in the series in that there isn't much of a mystery. I had already guessed much of the plot and most of the guesses were correct. But I must confess, this story is the most emotionally and spiritually touching of all the O'Malley books. From the aftermath of the shooting to Jennifer's sickness, there were moments where I felt like crying. Dee Henderson is a master at letting you get caught up into the story. The characters are likable, and I especially love Cole!<br />These are five books in the O'Malley Series in order, all highly recommended:<BR>#1 \\"The Negotiator\\", Kate O'Malley's story. One of the best of the series.<BR>#2 \\"The Guardian\\", Marcus O'Malley's story, the oldest of the O'Malleys. A great love story with an incredibly suspenseful plot!<BR>#3 \\"The Truth Seeker\\", Lisa O'Malley's story, very suspenseful!<BR>#4 \\"The Protector\\", Jack O'Malley's story, not as good as the previous three books yet still enjoyable. <BR>#5 \\"The Healer\\", Rachel O'Malley's story.<BR>#6 \\"The REscuer\\", Stephen O'Malley's story.

Dee Henderson, you're an incredible writer, my hat off to you! The sixth book of the O'Malley series, \\"The Rescuer\\" is a captivating and thrilling story! And if you've read all the previous books and loved them as much as I do, I'm sure you feel a part of the O'Malley family now!<br />The O'Malley family consists of seven brothers and sister, three boys and four girls. Since they were little they had been in the same orphanage and when they got out of the orphanage, they decided to 'adopt' each other, taking the name O'Malley as their family name. They all have very important jobs, Marcus is a U.S. Marshal, Kate a negotiator for hostage situations, botched-up robberies, etc., Jennifer is a doctor, Jack a fireman, Stephen a paramedic, Rachel a trauma psychologist, and Lisa is a forensic pathologist. This story is about Stephen O'Malley, 'the rescuer'.<br />Stephen O'Malley is a paramedic and he has been saving lives and rescuing people all his life. Now he's feeling insecure about himself and his life; his sister Jennifer has died from cancer and he can't come to terms to having to live without her. As for the rest of the O'Malleys, they are all Christians now, are all attached being either married or engaged, and have a sense of peace. Stephen on the other hand feels left out, he hasn't found someone special in his life and can't believe in a God he doesn't want to trust. <br />Meghan Delhart has had a crush on Stephen since at a very young age. She is blind because of a terrible accident years before. She knows that Stephen is hurting and will do anything to help him. But she also knows she can't become too close to him, she believes in her personal Savior Jesus while Stephen tries to run away from the truth. <br />Stolen jewels start to turn up at the strangest of places. And it seems that the criminal conspiracy is somehow connected to Meghan. Stephen will go to the greatest of lengths to protect and help her out, and before he knows it, he soon finds himself falling for her. But first he must work out the turmoil in his heart and search for the peace which has been eluding him all these years. Can Jesus Christ be the answer, can Stephen put his trust in the God he has been running away from? But time is running out, the race is on to find out about the jewels before the thieves do.<br />\\"The Rescuer\\" has got to be on of my most favorite of the O'Malley series, including \\"The Negotiator\\" and \\"The Guardian\\". It's not a real mystery story, but be assured there is a lot of suspense and intrigue! And the love story is an interesting one, Stephen and Meghan have been friends for years but cannot be anything more because of different beliefs. Stephen hasn't been mentioned that much in the previous books but here we get to know a lot about him. I really like his character, he's so believable and sounds like a great person to have as a friend. Meghan is also a good character, Dee Henderson gives us a look at the life of the blind in Meghan. I can highly recommend this book though I suggest you read the series in order. It's too bad this is the last of the series, maybe Dee Henderson will give us more stories on the second generation O'Malleys! <br />These are five books in the O'Malley Series in order, all highly recommended:<BR>#1 \\"The Negotiator\\", Kate O'Malley's story.

Morris. The world as we know it has changed after a terrible nuclear war. Fourteen-year-old Joshua Adams wakes up from a fifty year sleep to find himself escaped from the war. But to his surprised he finds that his awakening has hailed the beginning of an ancient prophecy. For years the genetically altered races of Earth have sung of Seven Sleepers who would awaken from a deep sleep and unite together with Goel to fight against the evil priests of the Sanhedrin. Josh's quest is to now find the other sleepers and continue the quest to rid the world of the Sanhedrin. But along the way, Josh and his new found friends, both from the old world and new world, must face dangers and betrayals that will threaten their faith and commitment to Goel.<br />Some say that these series live up to the standards of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", I beg to differ. Their are some similarities, one in that the main characters are of the younger generations, teenagers to be more specific. But while the Narnia series had a depth to it in which even adults will find themselves drawn into the story, \\"The Seven Sleepers Series\\" falls a bit flat. Gilbert Morris is an accomplished writer of more adult books, including the great \\"House of Winslow Series\\", \\"Appomattox Series\\", \\"Cheney Duvalle M.D. Series\\", and numerous other wonderful historical/fiction series. But his attempt to writing a series aimed for younger children is a bit disappointing.<br />First of all, the religious themes embedded into this series feels a bit contrite and not too well developed. Aslan was a great character in Narnia, but Goel's characters feels a bit flat even though he is supposed to be the Sleeper's spiritual champion. There is no real climax in the book as the story plods through at a mediocre pace. I had to force myself to finish the story.<br />But don't take me wrong, I am only giving my opinion as a sixteen-year-old. The series is aimed for kids younger than me. There is nothing objectionable in the stories so these books are great for kids ages 10-14. The only point I'm trying to make is some reviewers said that this series is up there with the Chronicles of Narnia. Whereas those series can be read by kids of a wide age range, \\"The Seven Sleepers\\" are strictly for younger kids.	2003-05-12

The second book of the Westmark Trilogy, the adventures of Westmark continues in \\"The Kestrel\\". Theo is now traveling through Westmark to learn more about the country. He and Mickle, now known as Princess Augusta, are hoping to be married after he returns. But suddenly and without warning, Westmark is thrown into turmoil as the neighboring country of Regia has declared war on Westmark. Theo is once again forced into making a hard decision, will he stay in the sidelines or fight for his country? Eventually, he joins under the command of Florian and his people to fight a guerrilla war against the troops of Regia. As he sees brave and honorable men die one by one, Theo finds himself changing into a merciless commander and a stranger to himself...<br />For those familiar with Lloyd Alexander's award winning series, \\"The Prydain Chronicles\\", I can honestly and truly recommend this other series written by the 'grand master of fantasy'. A bit more serious with dark overtones, \\"The Westmark Trilogy\\" deals with realistic events that can almost convince you that the series is based on true historical events. Through the series you will be given a chance to explore the characters as they struggle with forces beyond their control. Lloyd Alexander gives a realistically accurate study of human nature and psychology of war. I must say, after reading this book, I was left in thoughtful silence, musing over what I had just finished reading. It is not very often we Young Adults are given books which leaves you in a state of contemplation<br />As I said, I can highly recommend the thrilling and psychologically filling \\"Westmark Trilogy\\". Best to read in order. But the faint-hearted be warned, this book and the next one in the series are somewhat violent and gritty since the main theme is about war. But nothing too bad to turn away lovers of a good series! Pick these series up!	2003-05-12

Theo, a printer's apprentice, is about to have his whole life changed! When he agrees to print a traveling showman's pamphlet, he doesn't think about the consequences which might ensue. The printer shop is immediately closed down, his boss and friend is murdered, and a warrant is issued out for his arrest! He joins up with the traveling showman himself, Count Las Bombas who is actually a con artist, and his dwarf servant Musket. The trio is joined up by a street urchin, Mickle, who has a mysterious past. But it's not long before they are all caught up into political intrigue as the evil Chief Minister Cabbarus is planning to overthrow the king and take over the kingdom. And on the other hand, the mysterious Florian and his 'children' are determined to kick out the monarchy and put in a new government for Westmark. What will Theo do? Will he hold up the monarchy, support the revolutionists, or try to hide away from everything?<br />I have always loved reading the \\"Prydain Chronicles\\" which could be easily said to be one of the best fantasy novels for Young Adults. Lloyd Alexander is easily the grand master of fantasy and it is further proved when reading the \\"Westmark Trilogy\\". Besides providing plenty of lovable and interesting characters, the stories are always full of action, adventure, some romance, and humor. But differing from the \\"Prydain Chronicles\\", the \\"Westmark Trilogy\\" includes plenty of realistic political intrigue. It's almost like reading a historical fiction instead of a fantasy story.<br />Some people complained that this book was a bit too short which I can agree with. I think the end could of have been expanded a little more but it's nothing too bad. Thankfully, \\"Westmark\\" is only the first of a wonderful trilogy so I strongly you don't start reading this book before having all three volumes at hand. <br />But I must warn that in the next two books there are many deaths, including character deaths. I guess it makes the trilogy more realistic and grittier, so be warned for the faint-hearted. I myself almost cried at some points! But I do definitely recommend this trilogy for all Young Adults! Full of thrilling excitement, \\"Westmark\\" will please all fantasy fans!	2003-04-28

The Net Force Explorers are furious! Their caption, James Winters is being suspended after being accused of murder! Now the Explorer's will do anything to prove his innocence. But not only will they have to investigate a recent murder, they will also have to delve into the past of Captain James Winters - which includes the unfortunate death of his wife that took place four years ago. The Explorer's will also have to watch their backs because someone wants to make sure that secrets are left in the dark, and will do anything to keep it that way...<br />The NFE series are a great Young Adult fiction series, especially those with a love for computers and the Internet. Since the Net presented in the books have no boundaries, you will never know what to expect next. But there IS one thing you can come to expect: stories that have plenty of twists and turns, having the whole plot well balanced with mystery, excitement, and adventure. And sometimes, there's a good romance! The Net Force Explorers include Matt Hunter, Megan O'Malley, Leif Anderson, Andy Moore, Mark Gridley, David Gray, Maj Greene, and P.J. Farris. Occasionally other characters are introduced though they show up rarely.<br />\\"Private Lives\\" is one of my favorite NFE books! The reason as I stated is because two of my most favorite NFEs are the main characters in this story: Megan O'Malley and Leif Anderson. Meg is very much the tomboy and is an expert martial artist. With her stubborn personality, she's the type of person who likes to get things done. Leif Anderson comes from a wealthy family so he is constantly teased from Meg about being 'a rich kid playboy'. He and Meg are called the 'troublemakers' because put together Meg's recklessness and Leif's hacker skills, the two seem to always look for trouble. <br />\\"Private Justice\\" has a great plot, one of the best I've read. Already having read many of the books, I too at the beginning felt as angry as the NFEs felt when Captain Winters is put on suspension! And the ways the kids 'reacted' to this was hilarious! The bantering between the characters are well-written and at some points I was laughing so hard! It's also very obvious to everyone that Leif likes Meg so the light bantering between the two of them is cute! The only problem I have with the story is the ending was too abrupt. It was a bit startling for me when I finished reading the last page and I turned the next page expecting at least another chapter. I felt a bit disappointed not to read more about Leif and Matt since we left them at an interesting point in the story. Ah well, the rest of the story made up for the slight disappointment at the end.<br />The series is for Young Adults and I strongly recommend only older kids read it since there are many occasions where a few bad words are sprinkled here and there. Not that bad but still in a way a bit annoying to have them in the book. But I still highly recommend it for older kids for I'm sure you'll love it! The books can stand alone though I strongly recommend you read in order since in later books there are some referrences to earlier stories. Favorite part:<br />\\"Now I get it,\\" Leif said. \\"Things are getting out of hand, so you call in your pal the scamologist to see if he can't come up with something - what? Clever? Devious? Certainly something that Captain Winters would never approve of - if he heard about it.\\" Now this explains to you what kind of kids the NFE deals with. ;)	2003-03-18

It didn't matter who she married, as long as he was rich! But Catherine will not stand to be bartered off like cattle, and through trickery, wit and luck, she sends several would-be husbands running from her. But unfortunately, her father is a very stubborn man. Will Catherine ever be able to be free?<BR> <BR>When I read the summary on the back of the book, I sincerely thought I would really enjoy reading this book. I love stories of medieval England, and especially love reading about young teens who are high-spirited and clever. Unfortunately, though Catherine may be high spirited and clever, the words rude, selfish, willful, and annoying can also be used to describe her. Some of her humor and wit I must confess is really VERY funny! But most of the time I just couldn't get myself to like the character of Catherine at all. And there is no use trying to like the story when you can't stand the main character.<BR> <BR>And though Cushman may have wanted to write the book exactly about how it was during that era of time, sometimes things are better left unsaid. I was very surprised to find out that this book is recommended for children 12 and up. On the contrary, I would better suggest the kid to be at least 15 to read the book! Here are the reasons parents might want to beware of having younger children, maybe even older children read this book: <BR>1) The humor is extremely crude and vulgar most of the times, even might result in some readers (like me!) to feel very uncomfortable. <BR>2) Besides the humor, there are a lot of innuendos, it is always very obvious what Catherine is implying in her diary. Catherine is also frank about certain aspects growing up. So the humor and the innuendos put in the book might definitely turn off parents from letting their younger children read. <BR>3) Catherine clearly states that the words \\"Deuce\\" and \\"Corpus Bones\\" are profanities. Yet, Catherine VERY often uses the words, besides 'making up her own special profanity'. Though \\"Deuce\\" and \\"Corpus Bones\\" might be thought as 'very mild', considering that profanities nowadays are quite 'strong' I'm not sure how young children might react to this. <BR>4) Another point is that Catherine continually calls her father names, hates him openly, embarrasses him in public, etc. and etc. Though young adolescents might at times be very willful, Catherine is a bit too extreme. On the whole she also doesn't really respect others, except for her mother, Perkins, and Edward. And though Uncle George and Aelis are her friends, she at one points treats them terribly. <BR>5) Lastly, many references are made about religious aspects of growing up in medieval times. Catherine's views of God and the Devil are sometimes a bit strange, though I guess that might have been how it was at that time. There is also a few instances where she tries to curse someone :S and other times where superstitions are used. <br />As for criticism in a literary sense, I felt the writing was well done. It's almost like 'listening' about Catherine's feelings instead of reading them. But I felt that the end was just a bit too flat, it seemed to end too quickly...<br />The reason for my two stars are because some of the humor put in the book is extremely funny! I was especially laughing out loud at the parts about how Catherine sends (more like scares!) away her suitors! Overall though, I cannot recommend this book. There are just too many reasons why I can't enjoy the book to try to convince myself otherwise. I would instead recommend you to read \\"Ella Enchanted\\" another Newberry Honor Book. Now this is a WONDERFUL book to read about a young girl growing up with a terrible curse on her. A must-read!	2003-03-13
US	42636479	R1178DAZTZGVN7	0743419219	999050996	Timeless Love	Books	3	7	8	N	N	A bit disappointing but good for some light reading	Sixteen-year-old Samantha McKenna is your average ordinary modern teen. She can't wait to get her driver's license, she's looking forward to having the party she's been having planned, and can't wait to get to meet 'Kevin the Hunk' up close! But when she wrecks her father's precious BMW, she wishes to was anywhere but home. Strangely enough, by chance while holding onto the strange antique charm hung around her neck (an early birthday present), she is magically transported to... England in the year 1553! She meets the sickly Edward VI who is the young king of England. He is her own age, and Sam knows he is supposed to die at about sixteen. Determined to save his life, she does just that. Soon, the sick king is back to full health and everything seems to go beautifully. But as Sam thinks about returning back to her time, she is swept into the middle of a dangerous situation where her life might be at stake...<br />First off, I must say that I love all stories about history and romance. Judith O'Brien is a terrific writer and after reading the book it was most obvious she had done her research well. The descriptions are vividly written down, life back in the 1550s was certainly not all about beautiful parties and great adventures. The food, the hygiene, the clothes, etc., everything is made into a reality in the story as Sam struggles in extreme 'culture shock'. <br />The characters are on the whole likable. Sam is a bit too ordinary and is nobody really special. An 'ok' main character though she could have been made a bit more interesting. Historical characters such as Edward VI and Jane Grey are pretty well developed, and I especially loved Princess Elizabeth (soon-to-be the wonderful Queen Elizabeth!). The Duke of Northumberland is a 'good' bad guy. Barnaby Fitzpatrick is unfortunately not a character who went through good character development. By the end of the book, we really didn't know anything about his personality or anything.<br />Which brings me to have toexplain the reason for my giving only 3 stars for \\"Timeless Love\\". For once thing, as I said earlier, both Sam and Barnaby were... I don't know, they just felt flat and one dimensional. I just really couldn't relate to them as much as I would like to with the main characters of a story. And as it is hinted in the title, I can't really classify this as a real 'romance' story since Sam doesn't even meet Barnaby till like your a little more than half way through he book. So the little romance there is feels a bit rushed. Also, it's a bit strange and doesn't fit in with the rest of the story, plus it is too unbelievable.<br />All in all, the story is not that bad. A great book for some light reading, best for teens maybe 14 or older.	2003-03-13
US	42636479	RD0GKYGTG3V7M	0451184106	180666383	Stargate Tie-in	Books	4	12	13	N	N	One star off for numerous mistakes and typos...	\\"The passage to discovery is about to be entered...\\"<BR>It all began in North Africa 8000 B.C. when a young boy walks into a dazzling beam of light in the sky. Egypt 1928, on the Giza plateau near a great pyramid, a mysterious object shaped like a giant ring is discovered, baffling scientists and archaeologists. In 1994, the U.S. government with the help of Egyptologist Daniel Jackson discovers that this mysterious object is a Stargate. In other words, a device able to create a passage through space. And now, a special team of scientists and soldiers is going to be sent through the Stargate to an unknown destination. With no idea what they will find and absolutely no clue if they can return, the team is going to have the ultimate adventure of their lives...<br />I first saw the movie \\"Stargate\\" (1994) before reading this book. After watching the movie and instantly finding it a terrific film, I knew I would really like to read the novelization. And I must say, I totally enjoyed reading it though I do have my complaints about it. Here is a brief descriptions of the two main characters:<BR>Daniel Jackson: A brilliant young genius, Daniel though is scorned by the scientific community. From the first moment you read about him, I assure you that you'll find him a likable guy. Daniel is very witty and I love it when he gives his speech in the beginning of the story. <BR>Colonel Jack O'Neill: Jack is a retired operative of the U.S. special forces. Though tough and in every way a soldier, he also has a troubled past. Can't help but love him, I love his outward facade of being the 'perfect commander'. :)<BR>Another of my favorite characters is Lieutenant Colonel Adam Kawalsky. The banter between him and Daniel is great and I also like the tension between him and Colonel O'Neill.<br />THE GOOD: First I'll give you the good. The book is well-written by authors Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. It flows very well and it's a pretty easy read. The characters are very likable, oneof the most important elements of a great book. It's sometimes so terribly disappointing when you read novelizations from your favorite movies to find that your favorite characters are so dislikable when you read about them. The action and suspense is strongly given off the reader, definitely a page-turner at some points in the plot, making the book hard to put down. But most of all, some parts in the story is just totally HILARIOUS! Like there's the one instance where the people of the mysterious planet give Daniel and the soldiers a feast. That part just had me cracking up!<br />THE BAD: But unfortunately, there's also the bad. The publisher and editor of the book should be very ashamed of themselves as some other reviewers have states. Besides having lots of misspells and typos, there's also plot errors! There's a place where it is clearly stated that someone dies, then later on at one point he's alive and helping out a fellow soldier! Tsk, tsk, tsk! <br />On the overall, the book is a terrific one to read, though I recommend you read after watching the movie. Since the movie is rated PG-13, I guess I will rate the book the same. There is no sex though there is one instant which adults will definitely not want their children to read. Plus, the language is also pretty bad throughout the book. Best for kids 15 or older in my opinion though I would strongly suggest parents to look through the book before letting their children read.	2003-03-10

I've always loved reading the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexander. Filled with great adventures, the Prydain Chronicles tells the story of Taran, a lowly assistant pig-keeper, who grows up fighting evil with the comradship of numerous friends. His most beloved friends include the high-spirited and talkative Princess Eilowny, the faithful to the end Gurgi, and Fflewddur Fflam, a king who wants to be a bard. In the five books of the Prydain Chronicles, Alexander opened up the reader's eyes to a wonderful world of imagination.<br />In \\"The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain\\", the reader is given a chance to explore more of Prydain, the world of adventure and magic. Altogether, there are eight enchanting tales in this book:<BR>\\"The Foundling\\": Learn about Dallben when he was young and find out how he came to be in possession of The Book of Three.<BR>\\"The Stone\\": Read about the lovable yet still bad-tempered Doli of the Fair Folk and his magic stone.<BR>\\"The True Enchanter\\": The story of how Princess Eilowny's mother, Princess Angharad of the Castle of Llyr, finds true love with a true enchanter.<BR>\\"The Rascal Crow\\": As Medwyn, the ancient guardian and protector of animals, the rascal crow Kadwyir learns a valuable lesson in an Aesop's Fable type of story.<BR>\\"The Sword\\": Learn the terrible and tragic story of Rhitta, the sword Durnwyn, and the Spiral Castle.<BR>\\"The Smith, the Weaver, and the Harper\\": Of the three, who was the wisest and became a hero as he faced evil?<BR>\\"The Truthful Harp\\": King Flewddur Fflam maybe getting a lot more than he expects when he receives a beautiful harp...<BR>\\"Coll and His White Pig\\": Finally, the story of brave Coll when he sets out to rescue Hen Wen, his white pig.<br />A truly must-have book for the Prydain Chronicles fans, this book won't disappoint. Though this book is aimed mroe for Young Adults, teens and adults might probably enjoy this book, too. I love how the stories blend into the history of Prydain and how us readers can learn more about our favorite characters. Though it wouldn't matter whether you read this before or after the Prydain Series, I suggest that afterwards is better, I think this book will be better enjoyed that way. Don't forget to read the author's note! All-in-all, a short read full of terrific stories!	2003-03-10
US	42636479	R2549TNTO0MQMY	0345440951	490249600	X-Men: A Novelization	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A must-read for &quot;X-Men: The Movie&quot; fans!	&quot;X-Men: A Novelization&quot; is a novelization from the 2000 action packed movies starring Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellan. Genetic mutants are very real in the 'not too distant future'. Made outcasts from societies, these mutants are rejected, feared, and hated for their superhuman powers. Some mutants want to strike out against mankind, these mutants being led by the powerful Magneto. But then again, there are some mutants who uses their special abilities for the greater. They battle against prejudice and agents of intolerance to save mankind, these mutants are... the X-Men.<br />First off I would like to say that I've never been an X-Men fan, never even have read any of the comics. It was only recently that I saw the movie &quot;X-Men&quot;. I absolutely loved it and found the movie an amazing movie! So naturally I wanted to pick up the novelization. A great read I must say!<br />The basic plot is the same as the movie though there are some extra 'missing scenes' that were never in the movie. For example, I would have like to see some more of the friction between Wolverine and Cyclops in the movie like they had in the book. The characters are more realistic as we are able to go into their minds. The main character is that of Logan, or otherwise called Wolverine. He is a fascinating character as he at first tries to reject any help from anyone. That is until he meets up with first Marie (also called Rogue) then the X-Men. The writing is well-done, all the descriptions are done very nicely making you 'see' each scene. <br />Overall, I can highly recommend this book for all &quot;X-Men&quot; movie fans. I'm not sure if &quot;X-Men&quot; comics fans might enjoy this, since I don't know if the characters are very different from the comics. The movie was rated PG-13 so I guess this book is more for older teens and adults because of some swearing and the action is sometimes a bit violent.	2003-03-08

Frodo and Sam are on their own as they continue on their way towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring. Merry and Pippin are captured by the Uruk-Hai and it's up to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to rescue them. Both new allies and new foes will be made as the battle for Middle Earth continues. What will happen to the fellowship, will Middle Earth ever be rid of the evil of Sauron?<br />\\"The Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers Photo Guide\\" is the illustrated story from the epic New Line Cinema film. In other words, this is more like a picture book. Includes over 100 color photos which are of very high quality! LOTR movie buffs might have seen many of the pictures either on the Internet or somewhere else, but there are some photos which are new. Lots of the pictures have captions from the movie. It's easy to look through the book since at the top of each page there is like a title for each major scene in the movie (ex. \\"Plains of Rohan\\" or \\"Helm's Deep\\". <br />Some of the best pictures from the book include: Gandalf riding Shadowfax, Legolas riding a horse during the battle against Orcs and Wargs, Frodo keeping the Ring away from Faramir, Merry and Pippin in the capable 'hands' of Treebeard, and King Theoden riding into Helm's Deep. Plus plenty more!<br />Definitely not a replacement to seeing the actual movie or reading the original books by J.R.R. Tolkien, but I can still recommend this book for LOTR Movie fans and kids. My suggestion though is to watch the movie before reading this since in my opinion it's better to not know what will happen. Another reason to by this book is that there are some missing scenes from the movie. For example, in this photo guide it explains how the horse Brego was able to rescue Aragorn. AndFaramir's plan will be pleased to see at the end he helps Frodo and Sam more than in the movie. And some more info on Gollum's past! Hopefully an extended edition of \\"The Two Towers\\" will come out including these missing scenes!<br />Also included at the back of the Photo Guide are stickers of the characters of \\"The Two Towers\\". Stickers include Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Saruman, Faramir, Merry and Pippin, King Theoden, Eowyn, and Arwen, which is altogether twelve stickers. Some people might be disappointed to find that there is no sticker for Eomer, who will come to be a pretty major character in the Lord of the Rings.	2003-03-06

Beautifully done, this \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\\" 2003 Datebook by Cedco Publishing is very well worth the price. \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic story of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The movie directed by Peter Jackson, this is the story of the ultimate battle between good and evil, the fate of Middle-Earth and all of its people resting on the outcome. <br />This 12-month datebook is 5 3/4\\" x 8 1/8\\". Wire-O bound, there is also an elastic loop closure. There are 15 step-down index tabs, 12 monthly sections and 3 more sections for Address/Phone, Occasions, and Web Sites. For each month, there is both a monthly grid and weekly planner pages. Includes also 18 full-color images from the movie. <br />I can highly recommend this for all Lord of the Rings fans. The artwork is beautiful and well done, the main color being a reddish-tinged brown of maps of Middle-Earth. The paper is of very high quality and I'm sure that even at the end of the year, the datebook would still be in a pretty good condition. For me, the best feature is the section for Web Sites. I was so delighted to see there's a place to write down your passwords for each of your regular sites! Whew, now I won't have to worry about forgetting my passwords!<br />As I said, I can highly recommend this datebook for anybody. But if you're looking for a planner with more pictures from the movie \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\", I suggest you get the 2002-2003 Student Planner which has lots of pictures.	2003-02-17

Written by Seymour Reit, \\"Behind Rebel Lines\\" tells the true story of Emma Edmonds. Running away from her father at the age of sixteen, she had left Canada for the country where freedom and liberty would become a reality. Now the year 1861, Emma is now 21 and the Civil War between states has begun. When President Lincoln asks for volunteers, Emma is determined not to just sit by. She disguises herself as a man and enlists herself into the Union Army. Now everyone, including her superior officers and fellow soldiers, believe her to be Private Franklin Thompson, assigned to Company F. But Emma wants to do more, so she volunteers to be a Union spy. But while she has been all this time fooling her own army, can she keep her secret behind rebel lines?<br />A truly well-written story, \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" is sure to please. The author did a lot of research to write this book, re-creating Emma Edmond's story through Emma's memoirs, U.S. Army Records, and files from the National Archive. At the front cover of the book it is written \\"Great Episodes\\". This is because each chapter is separated in such a way. In that sense, while reading the story the reader might feel as though the book does not really flow as well as you would like. But on the overall, the whole story is written well if not a bit aimed more for younger audiences.<br />Emma's character is captivating and very realistic. Oh, I know that she WAS a real character, but in few cases, some authors cannot seem to grasp the character of who they're writing about. Fortunately, Seymour Reit puts down Emma's life down on paper flawlessly. You can almost 'hear' the imp voice in Emma's ear! <br />On the whole, \\"Behind Rebel Lines\\" is a gripping and fascinating historical biography and I can easily recommend it. Best for ages 10 - 14 but older teens and some adults might find this a good read. <br />\\"This stranger-than-fiction story will captivate history buffs and hold the attention of the most reluctant reader.\\"<BR>-BankStreet College of Education-	2003-01-30

His apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi is lost as he struggles to comfort his master and at the same time concentrate on the mission they are on. When Jedi Council member Mace Windu and Bant, Tahl's apprentice, come to aide them, Obi-Wan feels that everything will get better. But he couldn't be more wrong as Qui-Gon strikes out on his own, Bant resents him for not contacting her earlier about her master Tahl, and the situation on the planet Apsolon becomes perilous. Can Qui-Gon begin using his Jedi training to control his personal feelings? And can the mystery surrounding Apsolon be solved before it's too late?<br />\\"The Call to Vengeance\\" is the last part of a three book story arc. The story is extremely exciting and interesting to read as the events we've been reading about in the previous two books begin to reveal themselves. I was absolutely shocked when all of the deceit and secrets were revealed! But of course I found the ending very satisfying. My only small disappointment (my reason for taking 1/2 a star, resulting for the fours stars) is how Qui-Gon's character is portrayed. I can understand all of his feelings when Tahl dies and I completely agree that he will not be acting himself. But I just can't see him as someone who will be bent on revenge. I would definitely be sure that he would want the enemies be brought to justice, but he would not resort to revenge. But I guess that that's just my opinion. I also wish there would be more of Obi-Wan. Read \\"The Ties That Bind\\" and \\"The Death of Hope\\" before this book or I assure you that you will be a bit confused because many of the events which take place closely tie in with the two previous books.<br />This series explains a lot about how Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan first meet. Their beginning is far from simple and all smooth-sailings, which would be pretty monotonous if it was. Though the books are said for ages 9-12, like many other reviewers I agree that the Jedi Apprentice Series are for anybody. Extremely well-written, the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of the main characters are very well put down into words. I also like the different array of humans and aliens which are portrayed, both good and bad. <br />Plus check out the new Jedi Quest series, dealing with the master and apprentice duo of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Another Star Wars Series I recommend and like a lot are the Young Jedi Knights series. The stories are about Jacen and Jaina Solo (twins of Han and Leia Solo), and their friends as they journey on the road to becoming Jedi Knights. More on the teenager level of reading. For adult readings, a few selections I enjoy reading are \\"The Thrawn Trilogy\\", \\"Rogue Planet\\", \\"The Jedi Academy Trilogy\\", \\"The Corellian Trilogy\\", and \\"The Truce at Bakura\\".	2003-01-28

This time, they're headed for London, England.\\"<br />The story starts off in the year 1887. In the Forbidden City of China, Chon Wang's father, the Keeper of the Seal, is murdered and the Imperial Seal is stolen. Hearing about this and also that his sister, Lin, had followed the murderer to London, Chon Wang immediately sets out to find his sister. With friend and fellow partner Roy O'Bannon in tow, the two upon setting foot in England discover a dire plot to overthrow the two countries of China and England. Will Chon Wang, Roy, and Lin be able to catch the crooks and save the two countries?<br />\\"Shanghai Knights\\" is actually the prequel to the 2000 movie, \\"Shanghai Noon\\". Starring Jackie Chan as the 'fish-out-of-water' Chinese man who came to America and Owen Wilson as Roy O'Bannon the 'not-quite-your-average' outlaw, \\"Shanghai Noon\\" has always been one of my favorite movies to watch. And of course when I heard that the sequel \\"Shanghai Knights\\" was coming out, I knew I had to see it. But since the movie won't be coming out for a few more weeks (February 7th, 2003), I decided to get the novelization.<br />As far as the plot goes, I'm very much looking forward to seeing it on the big screen. There's definitely going to be a lot more acion than in the first movie, and plus there's a romance going on (you've probably guessed who falls in love with whom). And you might not believe me but the sequel might actually be a lot more fun than the first one!<br />As far as this novelization goes, it was an ok book to read but there is a down side to reading this novel. For one thing, the book is aimed more for kids, maybe 10 - 12. I knew from the beginning that since the movie will be rated PG-13, the book will be cutting some scenes and changing the plot a bit. I would have really preferred reading a 'real' novelization of \\"Shanghai Knights\\" but this is all there is. Plus the reading levelis very easy, I'm sure any teenager or adult will finish this in 1 hour flat.<br />If you're 13 or so and younger or you're really looking forward to seeing the movie, I can easily recommend this book for you. But if you're really not all that excited about the upcoming movie... just wait for the movie to come out.	2003-01-18

Meg O'Malley, a Net Force Explorer, is more than willing to go undercover to discover the identity of the illusive thief. Since her father, a renowned writer, has already been asked to host a writing workshop at Xanadu, Meg is given the perfect opportunity to conduct an investigation. But the beautiful resort with its gourmet food, entertainment, and high tech virtual sites may also be one of the most deadly places to be for Meg. For without any aide from other Net Force investigators, she's on her own to track down the thief.<br />The Net Force Explorers is a great Young Adult fiction series, especially those with a love for computers and the Internet. Since the Net presented in the books have no boundaries, you will never know what to expect next. With a well-thought out plot, this story has plenty of twists and turns, having the whole plot well balanced with mystery, excitement, and adventure. The end as usual becomes a bit technical and hard to follow as most of the books in the series but you still have a general idea what's going on. But I can't really say any more or I would ruin the story! :)<br />The characters of the book is what really makes the book more fun to read. Meg O'Malley is a terrific Net Force Explorer with her quick wits, sharp tongue, and martial arts talents. I especially found her very cool and I loved the part where she jokes about her brothers. Mark Gridley, who appears briefly towards the end of the book, is also a fun character. I wish there was more of him in the story. My only complaint for the story is that there's no Leif Anderson! I really loved him in \\"The Deadliest Game\\" (book #3 of the Net Force Explorer's series) and I wished he was here. Wim Dorfladen was a poor substitute to be put in as Meg's 'ally'. I really hope we get another story with the teaming up of Meg andLeif!<br />The series is for Young Adults and I strongly recommend only older kids read it since there are many occasions where a few bad words are sprinkled here and there. Not that bad but still in a way a bit annoying to have them in the book. But I still highly recommend it for older kids for I'm sure you'll love it!	2002-11-16
US	42636479	R1LPPJS3GAV1I3	0060519673	231187340	I Spy	Books	2	1	3	N	N	I do hope the movie is a lot better than the novelization!	When a super-stealth plane called the Switchblade is stolen, the United States government will do anything to make sure the deadly weapon does not get into the hands of terrorists. When BNS's intelligence finds out that the plane is being held in Hungary by a billionaire arms dealer named Arnold Gundars, they come up with a plan. They're going to send in Alex Scott, a super special government agent, into the European lair to steal back Switchblade. And his backup is going to be none other than world boxing champion Kelly Robinson! But no two men can be more different than Scott and Robinson. Will they be able to work together to save the world from terrorist hands?<br />Well, I must say that I am a pretty big fan of the original 60's \\"I Spy\\" TV series starring Robert Culp and Bill Cosby. Terrific series with ingenious plots taken at exotic places. And the partnership between their characters of Alexander Scott and Kelly Robinson is truly admirable. But I must that besides the names of the main characters, the new upcoming movie of \\"I Spy\\" is totally different from the series. And the main difference is this. The 1960's TV series has Alex Scott as a tennis player with Kelly Robinson his trainer. Both are specially trained agents and travel around the world going undercover. The new movie has Alex Scott as an agent being fluent with languages and Kelly Robinson being a boxer and a civilian. Plus, their personalities are completely different though Owen Wilson's Alex Scott will be a bit closer to the original than Eddie Murphy's portrayal of Kelly Robinson. <br />Alexander Scott, called Alex by all of his friends, is an incredibly cool agent (obviously my favorite character, plus he'll be played by one of my favorite actors of all time). He loves his job and he loves his country. He has a very positive view on the world and has a very funny, sarcastic, and witty kind of humor. He has this very cute school-boy crush on fellow agent Rachel Wright. I hope they put a bit more of her character in the movie. ;) But in the book the romance only seems to be a subplot. Plus he has some pretty cool skills, including a flair for languages. The first chapter is one of the best parts of the book, telling about Alex infiltrating a prison. Kelly Robinson is a superstar boxer who loves being 'the man', who loves all the ladies, who loves to refer to himself in a 'third person' way, and most of all... loves himself (obviously, this character can only be played by Eddie Murphy). His character is a bit annoying though you get a bit used to him as you read along.<br />Now I'd like to tell you about the 'bad points' of the book. I know this movie is going to be rated PG-13 for \\"action violence, some sexual content, and language.\\" But I must say this book was a bit too foul in language for me. In movies I can try to withstand and ignore the language while it's very difficult to do so when reading. I hope the movie will be at least a bit tamer than the book, I really hope so. As for the action/violence, the ending of the book is a bit graphic though nothing too bad. And as for sexual innuendos, too too much. It's not to graphic but as I said, they're 'innuendos'... you get the message though nothing explicit is said.<br />So putting it all together, I can only give this book 2 stars. Don't get me wrong, the whole idea of the \\"I Spy\\" is great and I thought the plot was extremely fun and interesting (especially as I said the first part). Plus some of the humor is very funny (especially the beginning where Alex gets a call...). But now I'm a bit apprehensive on watching the movie after reading this book. I do hope that the movie is an improvement over the book. My advice is, if you're looking forward to the movie, I think it'd be better to wait out on reading this book. But if you'd like to read it, I strongly recommend the book only for older teens and adults. I'm sure parents will disapprove young children reading \\"I Spy\\", the novelization. But I stillcan't wait till the movie is out!<br />Starring in the upcoming film will be (including my favorite movies in which they've played in): Owen Wilson as Alexander Scott (\\"Shanghai Noon\\", \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\"), Eddie Murphy as Kelly Robinson (\\"Shrek\\"), Famke Janssen as Rachel Wright (\\"X-Men: The Movie\\"), Malcolm MdDowell as Gundars (\\"Mr. Magoo\\"), and more.	2002-10-22
US	42636479	R310CNLOB3WOFI	0440407028	159056506	The Book of Three (Pyrdain Chronicles)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	First of a wonderful series, "The Prydain Chronicles"	Assistan Pig-Keeper Taran is on the verge of manhood and as such young men do, he dreams of adventure and battles. Or if anything to get away from the too peaceful Caer Dallben. Unfortunately, as his 'title' suggests, his only role in life is to assist in taking care of the oracular pig, Hen Wen. But Hen Wen one day panics then runs away from Caer Dallben for no apparent reason. From then on, Taran is thrust into an adventure to help the land of Prydain from destruction. Long ago the Sons of Don had kept off the forces of evil King Arawn, Lord of Annuvin, from taking over Prydain. Now the High King Math and his son Prince Gwydion, descendents of the House of Don, are being threatened by Arawn's powerful warlord, the Horned King. Will Prydain be saved from a terrible fate? With a band of strange yet the best kind of friends anyone could ever have, Taran finds himself fighting so good can have victory over evil, so that Prydain will be safe from the hands of evil?<br />Lloyd Alexander, author of the \\"Prydain Chronicles\\", wrote this series which resembles a bit of Welsh mythology and legends. Though under the category for young adults, I can truly say that even adults would probably find the world of Prydain fascinating. Victories in battle, good versus evil, relationship between friends, and responsibilities, \\"The Book of Three\\" has many good morals which we should have in real life. With lots of adventure, magic, humor, and excitement, \\"The Book of Three\\" has it all!<br />The characters are what really draw you deep into the story. Taran is your average hero who is reaching the age of adulthood and is far from perfect. A bit cocky and rash in the beginning, he still possess courage and enthusiasm which makes him all the more likable. Then there are plenty more terrific characters who each have their own quirks: the wise and courageous Prince Gwydion, the funny creature Gurgi with his 'crunchings and munchings', Fflewddur Fflam the prince who wants to be a bard, Princess Eilonwy of the golden hair who is charming and a motor-mouth, Doli the dwarf who wants to become invisible, Dallben the wise, and Coll the warrior now farmer. And these characters are only the good guys! Of the bad people, I like Queen Achren the most, a very powerful witch who in beginning gave King Arawn his powers. <br />Well, I can't really tell you anymore about the story except that the book doesn't end the story! The Chronicle continues the adventures of Taran as he grows up in \\"The Black Cauldron\\", \\"The Castle of Llyr\\", \\"Taran Wanderer\\", and \\"The High King\\". My favorites are the first three books though the last two books are a must read, too. And if you are wondering, yes, most of the same characters show up in the rest of the books and plenty more new ones! Have fun reading \\"The Prydain Chronicles\\"!	2002-10-19
US	42636479	R16QQBYC6891VD	0810919397	390794156	Animalia	Books	5	20	20	N	N	An amazing picture book by Graeme Base!	I remember distinctly the day on which I received this book as a present, along with another Graeme Base book \\"The Eleventh Hour\\". Being young, I was immediately fascinated by just looking at the front cover of \\"Animalia\\". And who wouldn't be fascinated with the beautiful artwork blossoming with abounding color? And I must say I just fell in love with the book!<br />\\"Within the pages of this book<BR>You may discover, if you look<BR>Beyond the spell of written words,<BR>A hidden land of beasts and birds.<br />For many things are 'of a kind',<BR>And those with keenest eyes will find<BR>A thousand things, or maybe more -<BR>It's up to your to keep the score.<br />Just by reading this poem (found in the very beginning of the book, the first two stanzas) you can tell what the book contains. \\"Animalia\\" is a picture book of A-Z, showing animals from Alligators to Zebras. And not your average alphabet book this is, each picture contains quite a number of things starting from the letter of each alphabet. And you also get quite a tongue twister for every letter. For example, I would never have imagined making a good tongue twister with the letter 'X' but Graeme uses a very unique technique (nice choice of words, huh?) to make an 'X' tongue twister.<br />And of course, the pictures and the quality in which they are written in is what makes Graeme Base's books so much more fun to read! Visually stunning, \\"Animalia\\" is pleasurable to the eye, I especially love the beautiful picture of the 'lazy lions lounging in the local library', reading books such as 'Lassie', 'Let's Learn Latin', 'and more. If you haven't had a chance to read or even peruse a Graeme Base book, I strongly recommend you do! Terrific for both young children and adults, I'm sure the books will satisfy!	2002-10-17

But using the 'Draw 50' books are so very, very easy to use! Lee J. Ames's drawing method is simple with the step-by-step instructions which are easy to follow. For kids 9 and older, \\"Draw 50 Dogs\\" by Lee J. Ames is great for drawing in your scrapbook, onto your notebooks, on cards, etc.<br />As the title says, this book includes instructions to draw 50 dogs; all of the 50 are different breeds and types. For me I love the portraits though I also love to draw dogs running or posing. My favorite pictures to draw are most probably the 'Irish Wolfhound', 'Cairn Terrier', 'German Shepherd Dog', 'Cocker Spaniel', and 'English Setter'. The book has another nice touch which is at the bottom of each drawing, there is some information on that dog including a brief history of the breed, average weight and height of the dog, and coat and color of the dog. Extremely helpful especially if you are thinking of coloring your drawing afterwards or would like to know how big to draw the dog when putting it in a background. My only complaint that there isn't a picture of a papillon to draw which I would like to (the reason? I have a papillon for a pet!).<br />Of course all of the \\"Draw 50\\" series are great, be sure to check them all out! The books I want are \\"Draw 50 Athletes\\", \\"Draw 50 Cats\\", \\"Draw 50 Cars, Trucks, and Motorcycles\\", and \\"Draw 50 Famous Faces\\".	2002-10-13
US	42636479	R1LZIYW6P6PLQJ	0380001411	689181285	Christy	Books	5	97	101	N	N	"Christy", an uplifting and spiritually filling book!	\\"Christy\\" is the story of 19 year old Christy Huddleston who is in search for something to fill her soul and give her a purpose in life. So volunteering to teach in a mission school, Christy journeys to the Smokey Mountains of Tennessee, more specifically the area of Cutter Gap. Along with her, the other missions workers are a Quaker woman whom Christy looks up to Miss Alice Henderson, the handsome and charming Reverend David Grantland, and the reverend's spinster and dour sister, Ida Grantland. As she begins to get used to living in the primitive surroundings, her heart reaches out the highlanders, especially to the children. Another person Christy begins to bond with is Doctor Neil MacNeil who has a strong desire to help his people. And as Christy struggles through hardships and heartache, joy and victories, she learns to have faith that God will take care of each and every one of them through good times and bad times.<br />\\"Christy\\" was written by Catherine Marshall in 1967. The book is under the category of 'fiction', but in actuality Catherine Marshall had written the story based on her mother, Christy's, life. An extremely uplifting and spiritually filling book, \\"Christy\\" is sure to please both young adults and adults.<br />The characters in the story are what really draw you into the book, making it a turn pager not in the sense that it's suspenseful, but in that you just want to read more and more about the characters. Christy Huddleston has all of the qualities of a young woman, intelligent, charming, yet a bit innocent. She also has a very curious mind and is always pondering about life and God's mysterious ways. Miss Alice Henderson is so well described you can just picture in your mind her 'queenly stature and beautiful poise'. I would sorely have liked to meet her in real life and discuss God with her as she has such a close relationship with Him. <br />Then there's the two men in Christy's life, the reverend and the doctor, both possessing unique attraction and strength. Reverend David Grantland is everything a girl dreams of, young, handsome, and incredibly romantic. But at the same time Christy finds he doesn't seem to have such a good relationship with God. Whenever Christy tries to ask him deep questions, his answers are vague, unfulfilling, and he also tries to avoid any discussions. Then of course we have Doctor Neil MacNeil, a man of science and not one of God. Though a highlander himself, since he had graduated from a prestigious college he is incredibly smart and sharp. His quick wit, quiet and calm ways, and cool attitude draws Christy towards him. But at the same time she can find him annoying and feels uncomfortable with him. Who is she in love with? I can't tell you the answer though I can assure you that Christy DOES find the love of her life, a man who loves her so very much.<br />Catherine Marshall puts into her story many instances where Christy questions God's mysterious ways, for example where is God when a close friend dies? How can God's mercy be taught to the people of Cutter Gap who are very poor and whose lives are very hard? Catherine Marshall writes so vividly and so well that you begin yourself to ask questions and as you read find the answers. Also, the end was SOOOOO well-done! I must admit that whenever I read the last two pages, I do get a bit misty eyed and I feel so uplifted! It's not the romance (though it does include romance) but it's the eloquence of this person's (I'm not telling who!) prayer to God. Whenever I finish reading the book, I always think, \\"that's how much faith I want to have in God!\\"<br />I highly recommend this book, probably for teens and adults, mostly for teens older than 14. One reason is because younger children might find the book a bit dull or deep. Also some adult issues are discussed that younger children won't understand and some teens mind find a bit uncomfortable. But I still very highly recommend this book to read for both enjoyment and learning. Also recommended is the \\"Christy\\" series in which all the episodes are sold from Volume 1-12 (though unfortunately most are not sold on Amazon, hint hint!). The cast includes Kellie Martin, Randall Batinkoff, Stewart Finlay-Mclennan, and Tyne Daly. Also in the year 2001, PAX tv gave made three Christy movies, \\"Return to Cutter Gap\\", \\"A Change of Seasons\\", and \\"A New Beginning\\". The cast includes Lauren Lee Smith, Stewart Finlay-McLennan, James Waterston, and Dianne Ladd.	2002-10-12

Since Roddy has done plenty of damaging 'pranks' before, the rest of the Group decides to exile Roddy, meaning no virtmails and no sims between the friends and him. But Roddy has something up his sleeve, a new 'playroom' he has recently created. But the 'playroom' is not all he's done, he's also discovered something of pure genius, something that can be used for good... or for evil.<br />The Net Force Explorers is a great Young Adult fiction series, especially those with a love for computers and the Internet. Since the Net presented in the books have no boundaries, you will never know what to expect next. With well-thought out plots, the stories have plenty of twists and turns, having the whole plot well balanced with mystery, excitement, and adventure. <br />Unfortunately for me, \\"One is the Loneliest Number\\" isn't one of my favorite Net Force Explorer's books. The reason is because the back of the book did not explain what the story was about very well so the first half of the book was very slow and a bit dull for me. I think the reason is because though in the back it says that the Group of Seven are Net Force Explorers, it's not necessarily true. Only Maj is an Explorer so Net Force doesn't appear for a while in the story. But as soon as things began to pick up, I must admit that the story was incredibly exciting! My tip is, though maybe a bit slow at first, keep reading. The last few chapters are EXTREMELY exciting!<br />The character of Maj Green is pretty average, has a temper that flairs up occasionally but soon simmers down. But for me my favorite character was Mark Grideley, who appears later in the book. He is fairly young, thirteen years old,but since he is the Net Force director's son, he's very smart. As stubborn as a rock, he is in a way a good leader. I LOVE the part where he, Maj, and Charlie (another Explorer) confront Roddy. But of course I can't say too much! <br />The series is for Young Adults and I strongly recommend only older kids read it since there are many occasions where a few bad words are sprinkled here and there.

He has what you might call a normal life. But things are just about to get hot when his jockey friend, Martin Stukely, dies in steeplechase accident. From then on, Gerard finds himself involved in a deadly search for a valuable videotape. Martin was the last person who had the tape, now the bad guys think that Gerard have it. And they would do anything to get it. The thing is, Gerard has no idea what the videotape contains, let alone understand the priceless information it contains. Gerard must try to solve the mystery of the videotape, while at the same time trying to survive...<br />I was very surprised to see the low ratings this book was getting from other reviewers. For my part, I enjoyed this book immensely! It might have something to do with this being only my third book to read of Dick Francis' while others have read many of his books. But still, I just thoroughly enjoy the flavor of Dick Francis' books. Especially when you read the first line of his book:<BR> <BR>\\"Four of us drove together to Cheltenham races on the day that Martin Stukely died there from a fall in a steeplechase.\\"<br />Francis just cuts right to the point and begins the story right off, which for me, immediately grabs my attention. From then on, he plunges you into a story worth the read with intrigue, mystery, romance, action, and wit.<br />Gerard Logan is the usual Francis character; young, bright, likable, and clearly a very nice chap. He also is as curious as anyone can be. There is also the usual love interest, in this book the detective constable Catherine Dodd. Beautiful and also very smart, she too is incredibly likable. In \\"Shattered\\", there is one magical moment where Gerard is captivated and inspired by Catherine's beauty to make a dynamic glass sculpture. I thought that Francis wrote that part very well.<br />And of course there are the bad guys, whom I won't reveal except that 'beware of Blackmask 4'! But the few of the most enjoyable characters whom I liked were Gerard's bodyguards. There's Worthington a chauffeur who watches over Gerard, the actual 'bodyguard' Tom Pigeon with his three Dobermans, and Gerard's taxi driver, Jim.<br />My only complaint of the book is the bit disappointing ending, I wish it was a bit different. But \\"Shattered\\" is still satisfying. As usual, Dick Francis cleverly weaves into the tale a bit of horse racing, steeple chasing. And adding glass blowing into the plot was pretty cool. I must admit that I now find glass making a bit more interesting and fascinating than, I was at first skeptical as to whether you can actual put glass blowing into a mystery thriller.<br />So if you've never read any of Dick Francis' books, I suggest you to pick up \\"Shattered\\" if you get a chance. But if you've read any of Francis' other books, I can't honestly tell you how good it is compared to them. You'll just have to see. \\"Shattered\\" is mostly for older teenagers and adults, due to some violence, some language, and some innuendo.	2002-09-26

After Mrs. Crale dies only one year after being tried and convicted, the murder is laid to rest. But now 16 years later, the Crale daughter, Carla, is given a letter from her mother. Mrs. Crale had written the letter before her death, in which she explicitly says she wasn't guilty of murder. Now Carla is determined to know the truth and hires the best person for the job, the remarkable Hercule Poirot. But can Poirot solve a murder which took place 16 years before?<br />Agatha Christie certainly spins a terrific story revolving around a murder which has been laid to rest for 16 years. Throughout the story we are given different points of views from different characters. This novel truly defines the meaning of 'in the eye of the beholder' since everyone has a different account to tell, a different viewpoint, and a difference in remembering facts. Though Poirot will never have the chance to meet the victim (Amyas Crale) or the supposed murderess (Caroline Crale), with the help of interviewing the people involved long ago. Part One tells about Poirot's interviews with the counsel for the defence, counsel for the prosecution, the solicitors, the police superintendent, and the five witnesses. Then Book Two focuses on the narratives of the five witnesses and the conclusion to the story.<br />Here's a quick introduction to the five witnesses (and suspects!). The title, \\"Five Little Pigs\\", refers to these five characters;<BR>Philip Blake - went to market: Best friend to the murdered victim, has good business sense and is a very precise man. Could he have devised the perfect plan to kill?<BR>Meredith Blake - stayed at home: The perfect example of a English country gentleman. Loves nature and has a very quiet temperament, but could he actually be a murderer?<BR>Elsa Greer - ate roast beef. She falls in love with Amyas and finds nothing wrong with stealing him from a lovely wife and daughter. Extremely greedy and selfish, could she kill her lover?<BR>Miss William - got none. A governess in the Crale household, she was soon going to be dismissed from teaching Mrs. Crale's young sister. Also has a distaste for men, and was angry at Amywas for wanting to leave his wife. <BR>Angela Warren - cried all the way home. Disfigured sister of Mrs. Crale, had many fights and arguments with the murdered man.<br />Everyone has a motive, and everyone seems to be hiding something. Who is the murderer and what had exactly taken place on that fateful day of Amyas' death? After reading to almost the conclusion, you'll probably have an idea what had happened. But I most assure, Christie has plenty of surprises and twists and turns for you!<br />\\"Five Little Pigs\\" is certainly well-written and should not be missed, but it's not one of my most favorite Christie stories. And some people might find it a bit repetitive though that's the beauty of the whole story, how everything meshes together subtly. I recommend you read \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" if you have never read any of Agatha Christie's mysteries before.	2002-09-24

Though I must say I like and enjoy reading about the stories of Hercule Poirot, probably Agatha Christie's most famous character, I really loved reading about Bobby and Frankie. I read this recently for the first time and now find it one of my favorite Christie stories! <br />When Bobby Jones discovers the body of a man at the bottom of a cliff, he never dreams how much adventure and danger he will find himself in. For before the man takes his last breathe, he says his last words, \\"Why didn't they ask Evans?\\" From then on, Bobby Jones is in terrible danger as more and more strange accidents occur. With the help of a childhood friend, the Lady France Derwent (called Frankie by her friends), they try to uncover the secret and mystery behind the death of the man. But throughout their investigation, they keep coming back to the mysterious question, \\"Why didn't they ask Evans?\\"...<br />Poirot's stories have this general type of flow to it, where you tend to have to use your head more to think out the mystery with the famous 'system of order and method'. The ending will take you completely by surprise and everything comes to place when Poirot 'presents the facts'. In the case of this book, Bobby and Frankie do an large amount of moving about, having adventures one after another, and going undercover. The reader also gets to feel more like he (or she) is participating more since Bobby and Frankie always meet and discuss everything together. Somehow, \\"Why Didn't They Ask Evans?\\" I actually enjoyed myself a lot in the way Christie changed her style a bit to make it more fun. But I must warn you, there's plenty of surprises throughout the way! <br />The characters of Bobby and Frankie are also incredibly likable. Bobby seems to be the bit more sensible one of the pair though as the story progresses, we see him coming out more with plenty of ideas and imagination. Frankie seems to be the somewhat opposite of her partner. She is in the beginning your usual 'comes from a rich family' young lady, a bit bored with life and wanting some adventure. But as things get more mysterious and dangerous, she can be very serious while keeping her chin up.<br />There is also plenty of humor which will keep you smiling throughout the story. Plenty of wit and sarcasm, and of course, plenty of chemistry between the two characters. From the very beginning you know that the two are meant for each so it's fun to see them flirt a bit, yet try to keep their distance. Bobby is so shy and deems himself not in her class, while Frankie just seems to wait for him to say something. The ending is completely satisfactory but I sorely wished there were more books out on Bobby and Frankie. Would have liked to read more about them.<br />I most guarantee that you'll love this book, check it out if you get a chance! And as I've said, besides Hercule Poirot, there are other Christie characters who are loads of fun and likable! There's Miss Marple, Parker Pyne, Mr. Quin, and others. Also, there is the great duo Tommy and Tuppence. A bit like Bobby and Frankie so I love reading about them in \\"The Secret Adversary\\", \\"Partners in Crime\\", \\"N or M?\\", and \\"By the Pricking of My Thumbs\\".	2002-09-19

Captain Hastings is invalided home from World War I, and while on leave comes across an old friend, John Cavendish. When Hastings is offered to stay for the duration of his leave with the Cavendish family, he immediately takes up the offer. Arriving at Styles Court, instead of having a relaxing and pleasant stay, he gets involved in a murder! The victim is Emily Inglethorpe, mother of John Cavendish, murder by poison. It is then that Hastings brings in the famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, a refugee from his homeland. Will the detective be able to sort through the clues, use method and order, and exercise his 'little grey cells' to bring the killer to justice?<br />This is truly one of Agatha Christie's best Poirot novel! My father, my sister, and I are the proud owners of almost all of Agatha Christie's mysteries. All of her books are just so enjoyable to read that the best atmosphere I recommend you read them in is when you're either curled up on the couch or relaxing on your bed. Very hard to put down, I can almost guarantee you won't take as long as a week to finish one book!<br />The story and plot of \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is ingenious, with lots of clues, happenings, twists and turns which never seem to come together or make sense! Agatha Christie has that writing style where she seems to be giving you everything, all of the hints and clues, but at the same keeping you in the dark, guessing and suspecting but never actually knowing. Then she gives you a finale which just leaves thinking, \\"Of course! Absolutely brilliant! That's how it happened!\\" <br />The character of Hercule Poirot has a personality all of his own. Yes, we have our Sherlock Holmes and other well known and well liked characters, but Hercule Poirot himself is a remarkable character. With his system of method and order, gathering all of the clues even the most significant ones, then putting them all together with the help of a little imagination, he is quite brilliant. Then there's Captain Hastings, so incredibly gullible that though at times you'd like to ask him whether he's keeping up with everything, you can't help but like him. <br />Then there's the array of other characters for this mystery who all seem to have a motive for murder: John Cavendish, Mary Cavendish, Alfred Inglethorpe, Evelyn Howard, Lawrence Cavendish, Cynthia Murdoch, Dorcas, and more. Everyone is under suspicion, who do you think is the murderer?<br />I recommend all of Hercule Poirot's mysteries. And besides Poirot, Agatha Christie has written stories on numerous other heroes and heroines, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, Parker Pine, and others. Other mystery writers whose work I enjoy reading are Lillian Jackson Braun and Dick Francis.<br />Also, don't miss out on any of the TV series and movies of Hercule Poirot. Starring as Poirot is David Suchet, perfect in his role! Plus, the movie, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is on DVD!	2002-09-18

If someone was to ask me who are my most favorite mystery writers, I would reply, \\"Agatha Christie, Dick Francis, and also let's not forget Lilian Jackson Braun!\\" I can honestly say that my father, my sister, and I are the proud owners of the whole \\"The Cat Who...\\" series. \\"The Cat Who Could Read Backwards\\" is the first book of the series.<br />After being on the unemployment list for some time, former newspaperman Jim Qwilleran's luck seems to be on his side as he is hired by the Daily Fluxion. But his excitement is quickly deflated as he discovers he's been assigned to cover the art beat, and if there's anybody who doesn't know anything about art, it's Qwilleran. He needs the job though so he agrees to take the assignment. But soon he discovers that the world of art is as deadly as the real world. A stabbing in an art gallery, vandalized paintings, and other mysterious events. Qwilleran then meets Koko, a brilliant Siamese cat with an extraordinary talent. Together they are teamed up together to solve the mystery and catch the crooks!<br />Each and every one of \\"The Cat Who...\\" series are intriguing and fun to read. As some reviewers have also said, I find that the best atmosphere to read the books are when you're either curled up on the couch or on your bed. It's very hard to put down, especially when you're down to the last few chapters. Like many good mystery writers, clues are given out throughout the whole book but not until the very end do they come together to solve the mysterious events. <br />The best thing about the stories for me is the undeniable chemistry between Jim Qwilleran and Koko who make a perfect pair (later on a female Siamese cat named Yum Yum joins the crew to really perfect the team). Jim Qwilleran is such an interesting character from his bushy salt and pepper mustache to his magnetism to crime. He also has a very dry sense of humor which will keep you chuckling. And of course there's Koko who is just too terrific! Lilian Jackson Braun describes him so perfectly that you can just picture him in your mind, a 'long, lean, muscular cat with sleek fur and an unbearable amount of assurance and authority'. Another character who frequently shows up is Odd Bunsen, a photographer for the Daily Fluxion. He's an extremely likable fellow and is one of my favorite secondary characters. <br />So if you love detective and mystery stories like Agatha Christie and Dick Francis books, I implore you to check out \\"The Cat Who Could Read Backwards\\". It most definitely is worth it!	2002-09-09
US	42636479	RQ507WNM8V52	0345435389	753640827	Rogue Planet (Star Wars)	Books	3	1	2	N	N	A bit boring, yet a should read for Star Wars fans	Three years have passed since &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Anakin Skywalker still retains his child-like innocence as he finds a deeper relationship with the Force. His master Obi-Wan Kenobi still feels he is not ready to take on a mission and with good reason, too. Though Anakin is strong in the Force, he still is undisciplined, bearing the scars of his former slavery. But the council and revered Jedi Thracia Cho Leem feel that Obi-Wan and Anakin should be sent to the planet of Zonama Sekot, home of where the galaxy's fastest ships are made. A year ago another Jedi Knight had been sent to the planet but nothing has been heard from her since. And as the two Jedis Obi-Wan and Anakin find strange going-ons of Zonama Sekot, Commander Wilhuff Tarkin and Raith Sienar make plans to extract the secrets of the planet...<br />The plot leaves much to be desired for as most of the story is focused on the building of the ships, plus all of the ceremonies and traditions involved. A bit strange, this part of the book never really held my interest and I had to slowly read along. But the beginning of the story is very interesting and exciting, telling about one of Anakin's romp in the underworld of Coruscant. The last part of the book is also extremely exciting to read. Probably the beginning and last part of the story is what saved &quot;Rogue Planet&quot; from complete dullness.<br />My favorite character of all the Star Wars, besides Harrison Ford as Han Solo, has always been Obi-Wan Kenobi. So when I first had heard about &quot;Rogue Planet&quot; I was very excited to read more about Obi-Wan. Unfortunately, he's in a way placed more as a secondary character to Anakin Skywalker. Also he is made very stern and at times made to be in the wrong. One of the most interesting characters for me was Raith Sienar. Somehow he's a very likable bad guy, if you know what I mean.<br />&quot;Rogue Planet&quot; I recommend for those who are Star Wars fans. But for those who have never read any Star Wars books and plan to start with this book, I recommend you read something first. Here are a few more Star Wars recommendations. First there's the Jedi Apprentice Series and Jedi Quest Series. Though aimed for young adults, they're extremely fun to read even for adults. Another Star Wars Series I recommend and like a lot are the Young Jedi Knights series. More on the teenager level of reading. For adult readings, a few selections I enjoy reading are &quot;The Thrawn Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Jedi Academy Trilogy&quot;, &quot;The Corellian Trilogy&quot;, and &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot;.	2002-08-27

Obi-Wan Kenobi is now sixteen-years-old and now has a pretty solid relationship with his master, Qui-Gon Jinn. But right now he is very confused as his master acts distant. The reason is because Qui-Gon is being plagued with terrible dreams about his good friend, the Jedi Tahl, and because of this, he is troubled in his heart. Tahl instead just feels that he is being protective of her because of her blindness. Because of this, Tahl resents any help from him. So when Tahl leaves for a solo mission and doesn't return on schedule, he defies the council and goes to the planet Apsolon to find her. Naturally his confused apprentice follows. But nothing is as it seems. Six years ago Qui-Gon and Tahl had helped bring peace to the planet of Apsolon. But now their leader has been killed and his twin daughters are in trouble. The people are divided between the Workers and the Absolutes and there is unrest as there are secrets and sabotoge. Will the Jedi be able to help the people of Apsolon? And at the same time, will Qui-Gon be able to search his heart for the answer about his feelings for Tahl?<br />\\"The Ties That Bind\\" is the first of a three book story arc. Though this is a Jedi 'Apprentice' series, the story mostly centers on Qui-Gon as he struggles to search his heart and feelings and he realizes his love for Tahl. The story doesn't really have much action in a way, the focus is more on the extremely satisfying plot with so many intricate twists and turns. I love how everything is kept secret and things are revealed little by little until the very end where everything is made clear! The story is also very dramatic and very sad at times. When reading any of the Jedi Apprentice books, I'm sure you'll realize what talent Jude Watson has, packing each and every book with all the elements of a good read. After reading this, have \\"The Death of Hope\\" and \\"The Call to Vengeance\\" on hand since this book ends in a cliffhanger!<br />This series explains a lot about how Qui-Gon andObi-Wan first meet. Their beginning is far from simple and all smooth-sailings, which would be pretty monotonous if it was. Though the books are said for ages 9-12, like many other reviewers I agree that the Jedi Apprentice Series are for anybody. Extremely well-written, the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of the main characters are very well put down into words. I also like the different array of humans and aliens which are portrayed, both good and bad. <br />Plust check out the new Jedi Quest series, dealing with the master and apprentice duo of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Another Star Wars Series I recommend and like a lot are the Young Jedi Knights series. The stories are about Jacen and Jaina Solo (twins of Han and Leia Solo), and their friends as they journey on the road to becoming Jedi Knights. More on the teenager level of reading. For adult readings, a few selections I enjoy reading are \\"The Thrawn Trilogy\\", \\"Rogue Planet\\", \\"The Jedi Academy Trilogy\\", \\"The Corellian Trilogy\\", and \\"The Truce at Bakura\\".	2002-08-21

Obi-Wan Kenobi, with the help of Jedi Master Adi Gallia and her apprentice Siri, rescue Qui-Gon Jinn from the clutches from Jenna Zan Arbor, but fail to stop her escape. The evil scientist Jenna Zan Arbor will stop at nothing as she tries to discover the secrets of the Force... then use them for her own power. When escaping, she takes along with her one Jedi who remains her captive. Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Adi Gallia, and Siri must rescue the Jedi and at the same time rescue a planet from her evil clutches.<br />\\"The Dangerous Rescue\\" is the conclusion of three books following one story arc. In my opinion, this is one of my most favorite story lines! The story is very exciting and Obi-Wan and another Jedi apprentice, Siri, go off on their own adventures when they go help Astri. Plus there's plenty more excitement as the deadly bounty hunter, Ona Nobis, is bent on having her revenge on Obi-Wan. I also love the character of Siri and am very happy that we get to read a little more about her. One problem I have is the return of the three bumbling characters, Cholly, Weez, and Tup. Somehow I found them a bit annoying but still, I guess their presence is needed somewhat. Read \\"The Deadly Hunter\\" and \\"The Evil Experiment\\" before this book or I assure you that you will be a bit confused because many of the events which take place closely tie in with the two previous books.<br />This series explains a lot about how Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan first meet.

Qui-Gon is consumed by dark visions, visions foreseeing something terrible about to happen to Tahl. With his apprentice Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon must rescue Tahl before it's too late. But nothing is easy as both enemies and friends may not be trusted because everyone has something to hide...<br />\\"The Death of Hope\\" is the second book of a three book story arc. By far as most people have mentioned, this book is the most sad and touching story. Again the book focuses mostly on Qui-Gon as he struggles to sort out his feelings and to save his loved one. As you continue reading the story, the true sides of both enemies and friends are revealed. It's very confusing as the Jedis have to sort out what is truth and what are lies.

Leed, the firstborn heir to the throne of Rutan, does not want to go back to his home planet and his father will stop at nothing to get him back. Will Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan be able to bring peace and keep the situation from turning to war and bloodshed?<br />For a children's series, each and every Jedi Apprentice book is jam-packed with excitement and suspense, at the same time giving you time to think.

I also love it how Obi-Wan is able to do a lot in the story, plus fight immensely well. But one of the best reasons is because of the bounty hunter. After Xanatos was cut off from the story, I was missing a really 'good' enemy, one worthy of battling weapons and wits against the Jedi team. And the bounty hunter (her name won't revealed till the next book, \\"The Evil Experiment\\", so I'm won't spoil it!) is pretty cool. I love her weapon of choice, her deadly whip.

Velma (Linda Cardellini) is tired of not getting any credit for her brain-work, Fred (a blonde Freddie Prinze Jr.) arrogantly thinks himself better working alone, and Daphne (Sara Michelle Gellar) has had it with her 'damsel-in-distress' part. Only Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby Doo (voice by Neil Fanning) is left heart-broken. But a few years later, the whole gang is invited to Spooky Island to investigate the mysterious going-ons and the strange behavior of the students who visit there. Of course the Scooby Gang wants to solve the mystery without the help of the others but in the end, they discover that the only way they would ever solve the mystery is to work together. But it will not be easy as clue by clue, the gang discovers a sinister plot to rule the world!<br />Included in this scrapbook is:<BR>*INTRODUCTION* - An introduction to how the making of the movie came about and about the idea of the plot.<BR>*MEET THE CAST* - Chapters based on how the director came to choose the stars, how the stars reacted, info on the characters they portrayed, and basic statistics on the stars.<BR>*MEET THE MAKERS OF SCOOBY-DOO* - About the making of the computer animated character, Scooby Doo.<BR>*SPECIAL FEATURES* - About all of the special effects, stunts, and action.<BR>*BEHIND THE SCENES* - Chapter on... well... the behind the scenes info!<BR>*SCOOBY IQ TEST* - A test on your Scooby smarts against the stars.<br />But one of the most reasons I like this book is because of the spectacular color photos. Every page has at least a few pictures, either behind the scenes pictures, movie stills, or production photos. There's a really coolpicture of Sarah Michelle Gellar in a type of Chinise martial arts costume.<br />Another book I recommend is the junior novelization of the movie \\"Scooby Doo\\". Very good for younger kids with great color photos included in the book.	2002-08-02

As he gets closer to Papa Cservanka's granddaughter, Syeira, a vivacious and strong willed teenager, Andy finds strange things happening under the big top. As he begins exploring the strange events, he finds that the cyber-circus could be under the threat of a black market ring. Can Andy figure everything out before someone gets hurt... including him?<br />For a Young Adult book, \\"High Wire\\" is great for all teenagers. With a well-thought out plot, this story will please those looking for a good read. Mel Odom, the author, gives plenty of twists and turns, having the whole plot well balanced with mystery, excitement, love, and adventure. As for myself, since I love using the internet, find this Net Force story intriguing as the Net has no boundaries.<br />The character of Andy Moore is a fun main character. For a teenager, he's very smart and it's interesting how he figures out problems and comes up with remarkable plans. I also would love to read more about all of his Net Force Explorer friends, especially Matt Hunter and Mark Grideley, called the Squirt. And though she is only mentioned and she doesn't come out in the story, I would love to read a story about Megan O'Malley who's supposed to be a martial artist.	2002-08-02

This junior novelization is based on the new hit movie \\"Scooby Doo\\". Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cardellini, \\"Scooby Doo\\" was made into an immediate favorite of mine after seeing it in theaters. So I of course got this book to read until the movie comes out on DVD. Here is the plot of the story:<br />When Mystery Inc. again solves another mystery, the gang splits up for reasons of their own. Velma is tired of not getting any credit for her brain-work, Fred arrogantly thinks himself better working alone, and Daphne has had it with her 'damsel-in-distress' part. Only Shaggy and Scooby Doo is left heart-broken. But a few years later, the whole gang is invited to Spooky Island to investigate the mysterious going-ons and the strange behavior of the students who visit there. Of course the Scooby Gang wants to solve the mystery without the help of the others but in the end, they discover that the only way they would ever solve the mystery is to work together. But it will not be easy as clue by clue, the gang discovers a sinister plot to rule the world!<br />In reality I would give this book 4 1/2 stars because of the style used to write the book. Every chapter is read through the eyes of the characters Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and occasionally Scooby. Overall, this approach was interesting to read and very fun to be able to see through the characters eyes. Unfortunately, using this technique also is at some points a damper since many subplots and events seem to be missing. But on the whole the story is fun to read and recommended for younger readers. Also included in the center of the book are pictures from the motion pictures, a total of 14 photos.<br />Also recommended is \\"Scooby Doo: The Complete Movie Scrapbook\\", the ultimate guide for all who loved the movie \\"Scooby Doo\\". Included cast and character guides, behind the scenes info, facts from the movie, special effects chapter, and a fun Scooby IQ test at the end of the book.	2002-08-02

And I must say, the book delivers a truly wonderful tale worthy of the Newbery Honor it received.<BR> <BR>It is the year 1832 and thirteen-year-old Charlotte Doyle is being summoned by her family to return to America. But what they don't know is that he two families who were to accompany Charlotte have suddenly decided not to go! Before she knows it, Charlotte is the lone lady passenger on board the 'Seahawk'. Though Captain Jaggery seems to be the only gentleman among the rough crew, Charlotte discovers that all is not what is seems. When she befriends the old cook Zachariah, she finds out that something is about to happen, something she never dreams would happen! Throughout the deadly voyage on the high seas, Charlotte will be tested in her courage, find out her true loyalties, and discover is she has the will to survive!<br />A truly amazing and thrilling tale, \\"The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle\\" will not disappoint. It starts off a bit slow I must confess for me but my feelings for the book changed almost immediately. A definite must-read for all young adults. Charlotte Doyle is such a remarkable character that you can't help but relate to her. In the beginning I was a bit startled by her actions of being 'the young lady' and how she must act the part. But soon I began to cheer her on as she began to really open her eyes to the situation growing around her.<br />Avi is truly a wonderful author and has proven the range of talent he/she has. I mean, I have had the book \\"Romeo and Juliet - Together (and Alive!) At Last\\", which is a totally hilarious book! I just laugh every time I read the book. But in \\"The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle\\", there is a sort of classic novel feel to it. If you liked this book or enjoy reading funny stories, don't miss \\"Romeo and Juliet - Together (and Alive!) At Last\\".	2002-07-16

Original, interesting, and having a superb cast with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, the movies will most likely remain one of my favorites for a very long time. So when I heard that &quot;Men in Black II&quot; was coming out on July 3rd, 2002, I was all for going to see it. But I decided first to read the official novelization by Esther M. Friesner to see what it would be like.<br />Here's the story. An unauthorized spaceship lands in Central Park, carrying a deadly Kylothian warrior. Her name is Serleena and her mission is: to bring the Light of Zartha back to her planet. MIB gets Agent Jay to be assigned to the case whose mission first involves getting back his old partner, Agent Kay. Only Agent Kay, whose memory had been wiped clean so he could retire, holds the secret to either the salvation or destruction of the planets Earth and Zartha. <br />The story is intriguing and the book can't be put down. It's very much like the original Men in Black, with all the elements which made the movie into such a success. First, about the characters. Jay is now a veteran agent, having a reputation of getting the job done, but he doesn't regularly go 'by the book'. There's also Kay, and even when his memory has been removed, he's still the tough, strong, and emotionless hard bitten guy we all know and love. Frank, the pug/alien is also back, now also working for MIB. His personality seems to have changed a bit. There's Zed, too who gets to do a lot more. But my favorite characters who have returned in MIIB is of course are the Worm Guys. They get lots more dialogue, more action, and get some pretty fun parts. And of course we get lots of new characters; Serleena a Kylothian warrior, Charlie/Scrad the two headed alien, Laura Vesquez who is Jay's love interest, and a few others.<br />I would actually give the book 4 and 1/2 stars because o Esther M. Friesner's style of writing. There are a few momentswhere it seems she's giving meaningless information and is dragging the plot a little.  But at the same time, she gives some pretty colorful and hilarious insight and the characters thoughts and feelings. One of my favorite parts is where Jay is thinking about this couple and in the book it says: &quot;They had been clearly made for each other, even if cynics everywhere would chime in with 'Yeah, out of spare parts.'&quot; It thought that line was soooo funny!<br />Anyway, this book is a fun read and highly enjoyable. But please don't think that if you get the book, you won't have to see the movie. Far from it, because of this book I'm more excited than before on seeing the movie! The book is mostly for older teenagers and adults.	2002-06-22

Based on the movie \\"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones\\", this postcard book has 16 punchout postcards. The photos are great, most of them my favorite movie stills! Definitely the postcards shouldn't be sent out to friends and family, but kept to collect. Better yet, you shouldn't even punch the cards out! For those who don't know the story of \\"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones\\", here's a brief summary.<br />From the last 10 years since \\"The Phantom Menace\\", a war is brewing between the Republic and a group of Separatists who are threatening to leave the Republic. The Senate is in chaos, arguing whether they should create an army of their own since there aren't enough Jedis. When Padme Amidala, now the Senator of Naboo, is targeted by an assassin, the Jedi send two Jedis to protect them: Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, now Master and Apprentice. Anakin is already having enough trouble by being rebellious, irresponsible, and having no self-control. But when he meets Padme again, he finds himself uncontrollably falling in love with her and she for him. While this is going on, Obi-Wan must find out the mystery behind the Separatists movement, a huge clone army, and a strange and cunning bounty hunter.<br />And here's a list of the cards in the book, including the size in inches:<BR>*1* (3.5\\" x 6\\") Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala on a romantic place in Naboo.<BR>*2* (3.5\\" x 7.25\\") Obi-Wan Kenobi deflects a blaster bolt from Jango Fett on Kamino.<BR>*3* (4\\" x 5.5\\") Character photo of Padme Amidala.<BR>*4* (4\\" x 5.5\\") Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker on a speeder chase on Coruscant.<BR>*5* (4\\" x 5.5\\") Mace Windu is thinking with Yoda, Padme, Jar-jar and others in the background.<BR>*6* (4\\" x 5.5\\") Character photo of Zam Wessil.<BR>*7* (4\\" x 5.5\\") A fight scene between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jango Fett on Kamino.<BR>*8* (4\\" x 5.5\\") Obi-Wan Kenobi in his starfighter with R4-P.<BR>*9* (5.5\\" x 8.5\\") Yoda with the caption, \\"Do their duty, the Jedi will.\\"<BR>*10* (4.25\\" x 9.25\\") Coruscant with the caption, \\"Coruscant - Wish you were here!\\"<BR>*11* (4.25\\" x 9.25\\") A picture of the Jedi Temple's Archives Library.<BR>*12* (4\\" x 5.5\\") Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.<BR>*13* (4\\" x 5.5\\") An advertisement on \\"Attack of the Clones\\" Hasbro toys.<BR>*14* (5.5\\" x 8.5\\") Obi-Wan Kenobi with the Kaminoans Taun We and Prime Minister Lama Su.<BR>*15* (3.5\\" x 6\\") Obi-Wan Kenobi fighting a lightsaber duel with Count Dooku.<br />*16* (3.5\\" x 6\\") Jango Fett flying with his jet pack on Kamino.<br />I also recommend \\"Attack of the Clones Scrapbook\\", \\"Attack of the Clones\\" by R.A.

Living in Japan has some disadvantages, one is that movies come out in theaters much later than in America. \\"Attack of the Clones\\" came out already in the States on May 13, the movie comes out in the middle of July over here. So I have to make do with looking it up on the Internet and buying the books on \\"Attack of the Clones\\".<br />This movie storybook is definitely a must-have. Oh, yes, the book is said to be for ages 4-8 (I'm 15) but still it's enjoyable and entertaining to read. Reading the story is great fun but the best part for me is looking at the magnificent pictures! While reading the story you get to see plenty of movie stills (about 125 movie-still photographs if I'm correct). For those who don't know the story of \\"Star Wars: Attack of the Clones\\", here's a brief summary.<br />From the last 10 years since \\"The Phantom Menace\\", a war is brewing between the Republic and a group of Separatists who are threatening to leave the Republic.

After crossing paths with Black Fetchen and coming out of the ordeal alive, they knew it was best to keep away from him. But when they are asked to escort young and pretty Judith Costello to her father's ranch, they couldn't refuse. Unfortunately, Black Fetchen has had his eye on Judith for a while and wants to marry her. Judith being young also wants to marry him, not knowing what is good for her. So when the Sacketts leave with Judith, Fetchen follows them along with his gang of hired guns and troublemakers. But Fetchen also has another reason for following them out west... and Flagan and Galloway are never the ones to stay away from trouble, no less back away from a fight.<br />One of my favorite Sackett novels, which is saying a lot since all of the books are fantastic! Louis L'Amour captures the West to perfection in all of his books, making you really get into the story and get to know each and every one of his characters. \\"The Sky-Liners\\" differs in some ways from the other Sackett novels in which it has some very humorous parts! From the very first page I guarantee you'll be laughing (I always do!). I'm serious, the first maybe three or four pages where Flagan and Galloway face the Fetchens is hilarious! But the book has its serious and grim parts, with plenty of action and gun fights.<br />If you loved \\"The Sky-Liners\\", I surely do recommend \\"Galloway\\", which continues the adventures of the Sackett brothers. But all-in-all, all of the Sackett novels should be read. A few other of my favorites are \\"Jubal Sackett\\", \\"Ride the River\\", and \\"Sackett\\". Other Louis L'Amour greats are \\"Crossfire Trail\\", \\"Westward the Tide\\", \\"A Man Called Noon\\", \\"North to the Rails\\", and \\"Hills of Homicide\\".	2002-05-29

Unfortunately, he finds out that he would be going with another Jedi Team, Adi Gallia and her new apprentice Siri. Obi-Wan just can't seem to understand Siri, finding her competitive, serious, and hard to be with. But they would have to work together if they want to complete their mission. The planet of Kegan is completely cut off from the rest of the galaxy. So it was a surprise to the Jedi when the recieve a request to test a young potential Jedi on the planet. The Jedis do not get a warm welcome, finding the planet full of deception and secrets. <br />A great read yet as I said, not very exciting. There aren't many chances for the Jedis to show their lightsaber skills. But the character development is good, especially between Obi-Wan and Siri. \\"The Fight for Truth\\" has plenty of story twists and turns to make it enjoyable, yet not too confusing to make it boring. I could just feel the frustrations from Obi-Wan and Siri as they try to argue with the teachers!<br />This series explains a lot about how Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan first meet. Their beginning is far from simple and all smooth-sailings, which would be pretty monotonous if it was. Though the books are said for ages 9-12, like many other reviewers I agree that the Jedi Apprentice Series are for anybody. Extremely well-written, the emotions, thoughts, and feelings of the main characters are very well put down into words. I also like the different array of humans and aliens which are portrayed, both good and bad.<br />Like I said the rest of the Jedi Apprentice books, altogether 20 books, are written by Jude Watson and are all very highly recommended from me. The books don't really 'end' at all, the books ends in either a cliffhanger or with a little glimpse into the future. Believe me, once you start reading them, you'll want to read the next one... then the next one... I can't wait for Jude Watson's next Star Wars series, The Jedi Quest Series with Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Jedi Master and Anakin Skywalker as the Padawan Apprentice.<br />Another Star Wars Series I recommend and like a lot are the Young Jedi Knights series. The stories are about Jacen and Jaina Solo (twins of Han and Leia Solo), and their friends as they journey on the road to becoming Jedi Knights. More on the teenager level of reading. For adult readings, a few selections I enjoy reading are \\"The Thrawn Trilogy\\", \\"Rogue Planet\\", \\"The Jedi Academy Trilogy\\", \\"The Corellian Trilogy\\", and \\"The Truce at Bakura\\".	2002-05-22

Alexander is asked for his help in hiding Ivan's two treasures, the King Alfred cup and Golden Malt, a valuable racing thoroughbred. But soon Alexander realizes that not only will he have to protect these two items at the same trying to find out where the embezzled money went, he must also watch out for himself as things turn from worse to deadly...<br />My second Dick Francis novel to read, I found \\"To the Hilt\\" a totally enjoyable read. Very exciting and suspenseful, there's a lot of mystery. Alexander is a delightfully fun character, you can't help but feel sorry for him as he gets more and more involved in helping his stepfather although the only thing he wants to do is paint. Dick Francis must also be applauded for his array of interesting characters. There's the jealous stepsister Patty who would do anything to discredit Alexander, Alexander's uncle Robert the Earl, Oliver Grantchester the lawyer, and more. But probably my most favorite characters is 'Young and Uttley', who is really just one person. I love how he has so many disguises. I cracked up laughing at one part where Alexander tries not to reveal that his 'lady-friend' is actually his 'Young and Uttley' bodyguard!...	2002-05-13

The World Government is controlled by wealthy Technocrats who have outlawed Christianity. The Christians are then forced to live in Old Newyork, now a bombed-out island where only the criminal and poverty-stricken Welfaros live. The World Government decides to destroy the whole island of Old Newyork, killing all of its inhabitants. But a committee together comes up with a plan, one in which they will need to find a hero. After giving up on many candidates, they have only one last hope, that is to test the Welfaro, Mok. Will he be able to survive through the 'Cyberquest'?<br />This complete book of the Cyberquest series (consisting of 6 short books) is a great read. If parents are searching for a good book with a Christian theme for their kids, this book is definitely worth looking up! It has adventure, suspense, Christian morals, and a futuristic setting which would appeal to kids ages 9 and up. The character Mok is your typical hero, poor and not educated yet intelligent, searching for the answer about who the Galilee man is, and if this person called Jesus really lived... and still lives?<br />My only complaint about \\"Cyberquest\\" is some points about the writing. I love twists and turns in the plot and especially love surprises. This book has plenty of them except at some parts I can't help but feel like it wasn't written down well. Either the scene was a bit rushed or forced upon you quickly you don't know what's going on, confusing the reader at some intervals. Other than that it's a great, lightweight adventure story to read. A bit of a reminder, since this book is six books in one, many times things or events are repeated or explained numerous times.<br />Two other Sigmund Brouwer series I love are \\"Lightning on Ice Series\\" and the \\"Mars Diaries\\". The \\"Lightning on Ice\\" books are about teenage ice hockey players while the \\"Mars Diaries\\" are a science fiction series on a teenager who lives on a colony on Mars.	2002-05-13

A few days ago my father told me that I should try out \\"10 lb. Penalty\\", saying that I might like it. And I surely did enjoy it! Totally hooked, I finished the book in about three days, each page an excitement and pleasure to read. <br />Here's the main plot: Young soon-to-be eighteen-year-old Benedict Juliar's hopes of becoming a steeplechase jockey are all dashed when he is fired for reason he can't understand. But things become clear as he realizes the whole idea was his father's. George Juliard is a businessman battling a Dorset by-election for a street level entry into politics. And he now needs his son to help him in his campaign. Benedict has no choice and agrees. Unfortunately, things get bad as many strange and dangerous incidents occur. Can Benedict protect his father from a mysterious attacker? <br />Dick Francis has a style all his own, with a plot which is believable and realistic. But one of the best things I liked about \\"10 lb. Penalty\\" is the wonderful array of characters. Each individual has his or her own personality, flaws, and characteristics put on paper so well that you can't help but feel that you know each person. There's characters like Benedict Juliard, George Juliard, Orinda Nagle, Mervyn Teck, Polly, A. L. Wyvern, Usher Rudd, and others. In the story also there is a quality of humor to it, making me chuckle at times. But still this book is ONLY for older people, NOT for younger children, due to language and innuendos.<br />Most of the reviewers have given less than 5 stars for this book, saying it was very different and not as good as Dick Francis' other books. I cannot agree or disagree with that since this is my first book of his to read and I think 5 stars is very much indeed accurate. I'm now also reading \\"To the Hilt\\" which I'm finding VERY interesting and exciting to read!	2002-05-09

Obi-Wan Kenobi is still dealing with grief over the death of another Jedi student, Bruck Chun. Unfortunately, Bruck's father and brother are blaming Obi-Wan on the death, saying that Obi-Wan murdered him! Together with Qui-Gon Jinn his Master, Obi-Wan must clear his name. But even if he is found not guilty, he will gain a hateful enemy. Twelve years later, Obi-Wan is now a Jedi Knight and master to young Anakin Skywalker. Obi-Wan's past is just about to catch up with him as he must face his old enemies. Together with Anakin, Obi-Wan fights off deception with truth, solving a mystery which was never really solved.<br />Completely enjoyable, it's very hard not to read the whole book in one read. The book is separated generally in two parts, the first part involving Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, the second part Obi-Wan and Anakin. The first part was very well written, putting Obi-Wan's emotions into words with such reality that you can't help but feel for him. The second part has more action and adventure, ending the story well. We also get to read again about past characters Den and Andra, from book 8, \\"The Day of Reckoning\\". Very exciting and fun to read, \\"Deceptions\\" is an exceptionally 'special' edition, a must-read for Jedi Apprentice fans.<br />This series explains a lot about how Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan first meet. Their beginning is far from simple and all smooth-sailings, which would be pretty monotonous if it was.

Obi-Wan was so hopeful that Qui-Gon would take him as an apprentice after all they've gone through but Qui-Gon is reluctant to do that. Qui-Gon cannot forget his past, concerning his first apprentice, Xanatos, who had gone to the dark side of the Force. Qui-Gon sees in Obi-Wan what he saw in Xanatos; eagerness, determination, and strength. He also sees the same weaknesses; fear and anger. But Qui-Gon's past is just about to catch up with him, can Xanatos have been the one who had gotten him involved with the mining corporations in Bandomeer? Qui-Gon is afraid that Xanatos is not only back into his life... he's afraid that Xanatos wants revenge.<br />Truly exciting and fast-paced, \\"The Dark Rival\\" is a fantastic read! This is Jude Watson's first try in the Jedi Apprentice series, with Dave Wolverton writing the first book, \\"The Rising Force\\". Now Jude Watson has written 18 more books after this and she's done an astoundingly good job!<br />This series explains a lot about how Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan first meet.

But they are sent there without the consent of the people on the planet. Obi-Wan is surprised to see how much hatred there is between the two warring peoples. No negotiations can heal the planet. The Jedis are helped by a band of rebel children calling themselves the \\"Young\\" who are tired of war and want it to stop. Obi-Wan is swept away by their cause and instead of seeing their anger for their elders, he only sees their passion.

He has this nagging suspicion that something is about to happen, something terrible. Little does he know that whatever he is experiencing has something to do with the mysterious creature called.. the Dream Thief.

Lawhead so for my birthday, I decided to get &quot;Dream Thief&quot;. And I've had a totally enjoyable time reading it! It has everything, exciting adventure, alien settings, lots of suspense, character development, well thought out plot, romance, and a great reference to God. I must say that one of the best things about the book are the amazing characters whom I just loved! There's Spence, Ari, Adjani, Gita, Kyr, Packer, Kalkinov, and plenty more. I can't tell you much more about the book, it would ruin the book. You're just kept in suspense till the very end!

Dee Henderson is probably... no, not probably but she IS my favorite Christian writer!! This book is the fourth of the O'Malley series. The O'Malley family consists of seven brothers and sister, three boys and four girls. Since they were little they had been in the same orphanage and when they got out of the orphanage, they decided to 'adopt' each other, taking the name O'Malley as their family name. They all have very important jobs, Marcus is a U.S. Marshal, Kate a negotiator for hostage situations, botched-up robberies, etc., Jennifer is a doctor, Jack a fireman, Rachel a trauma psychologist, and Lisa is a forensic pathologist. This story is about Jack O'Malley, the protector.<br />The story begins with Fireman Jack O'Malley finding out that he has an arsonist on his hands. The person's identity is a mystery but he leaves his signature of popcorn at the fire site and hateful words on walls. Who is this person? Jack O'Malley must find out because he fears that whoever the person is... the person is escalating. And not only that, sidelined firefighter Cassie Ellis is afraid she has seen the arsonist. And she's afraid that it's someone she knows. Jack is determined to protect Cassie who to his surprise he begins to fall in love with. Can they solve the mystery before the arsonist goes to far? And can Jack trust God with the kind of faith Cassie has?<br />Terrific story, I just love the O'Malley series! By far, Kate O'Malley has always been my favorite character but ever since I read this book, I find Jack O'Malley to be a fun character, too. Unfortunately though, the book doesn't have as much romance in it as the other books, which was a bit disappointing for me. Another difference from the rest of the books which is good is that &quot;The Protector&quot; is highly suspenseful. You'll never guess who the arsonist is! Throughout the whole book I was guessing and trying to figure out but my answer was completely different from the conclusion of the story. The book also lets you have a glimpse at Rachel O'Malley getting closer to Christ and also her growing romance with Cole. I can't wait till &quot;The Healer&quot; comes out in July 2002. I also want to read more about Stephen, who isn't mentioned very much in any of the books. I'm curious to read about him. Also for Jennifer's story of how she fights cancer. My suggestion to you if you've never read any of Dee Henderson's books is to read first &quot;Danger in the Shadows&quot;, then on to the O'Malley series. The Uncommon Heroes Series is also pretty great.<br />The first in the O'Malley series is &quot;The Negotiator&quot; in which the main character is Jack's sister, Kate O'Malley. The next in the O'Malley series is &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which the main character is Marcus O'Malley, the oldest of the O'Malley's. This is also another great book! Then after that there is &quot;The Truth-Seeker&quot; with Lisa O'Malley. Other books by Dee Henderson is &quot;Danger in the Shadows&quot; (written before &quot;The Negotiator&quot; whose main character is Dave Richman's sister, Sara) and &quot;True Devotion&quot; and &quot;True Valor&quot; of the Uncommon Heroes Series. Don't miss any of these books!	2002-03-27

And before you know it, she's the star of school! Everyone loves her, she has forty dates to the Grad Night Dance, gets to hang out with the popular kids, and receives love poetry from an anonymous person. Wilma can't think of any way her life could get any better and forgets that all wishes sometimes has a few loopholes to it. Soon she discovers that her popularity might not last...<br />Ever since I read \\"Ella Enchanted\\", I knew I had to read another Gail Carson Levine book. So for my birthday I got \\"The Wish\\", which sounded so enjoyable to me. And it was a terrific book, though I give it only 4.5 stars because in my opinion the book could have been a little longer. But it was still great. It's amazing how well Levine was able to describe the life of a 14-year-old so realistically. \\"The Wish\\" has a very good lesson to it, giving the reader a real look on the subject about popularity and true friends. Though the book says it's for kids ages 8-12, for me I thought it was more like for girls 12-up.	2002-03-13

Written by the terrific husband and wife team, Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta, the Star Wars Young Jedi Knights series are not to be missed! These series of books center on the young twins of Han Solo and Lei Organa, Jacen and Jacen, and their friends, Lowbacca and Tenel Ka, as they journey on the road to becoming Jedi Knights.<br />The second book, \\"Shadow Academy\\", begins where the twins and their friend Lowie journey to Lando's new venture, GemDiver Station. Unfortunately, Tenel Ka couldn't go with them since her grandmother, the Matriarch of the Royal Hapan Cluster, had sent her ambassador, Yfra, to visit her. Tenel Ka has still not confessed to her friends about her true identity, the heir to the Royal Throne of Hapes. But little does anyone know that an evil force is growing stronger all the time, this same evil force with evil plans for the young jedi knights...<br />\\"Shadow Academy\\" is so much fun, one of my favorites of the first part of the first six books of the series. But \\"Lightsbaers\\" and \\"Jedi Under Siege\\" comes pretty close. The five main characters of the books are well likable because each of them have their own personalities, characteristics, and quirks.<br />JACEN: He loves all living thing from plants, animals, to insects. In his own room he has his on menagerie of them. He has a special talent in using the Force to communicate with living creatures. <BR>JAINA: An almost complete opposite of her brother, she takes after her father, Han Solo. She is a mechanical whiz and just loves taking apart and putting together droids, machines, and just almost anything. Also like her father, she is very spirited and has a self-confidence which makes her a natural leader.<BR>LOWBACCA: Called Lowie by his friends, he is a Wookie and the nephew of Chewbacca. Very courageous and strong, he loves his friends very much. But sometimes he can't but just help missing his home planet Kashyyyk.<BR>EM TEEDEE: Very much like C-3PO (almost to a fault), Em Teedee isa miniature translating droid who is always kept on Lowie's belt. Though talkative and annoying at times, Em Teedee is a member of the five friends.<BR>TENEL KA: My personal favorite character, Tenel Ka is the daughter of Teneniel Djo, one of the witches of Dathomir, and Prince Isolder of the Royal House of Hapes. Loyal, a little humorless, brave, and strong, she is a warrior and most of all a true friend. Though strong in the force, she tries not to rely too much in it so she is very athletic.<br />So I highly recommend you read all of the fourteen books in order. The series are divided mostly into three parts. The first six books are about the rising force of the Empire and its Dark Jedi Knights. The next five books are about how the Jedi's must stop the Diversity Alliance. And the last three books are how the Jedi's deal with Czethros and Black Sun. Another Star Wars series I very much recommend are the \\"Jedi Apprentice\\" series. Don't miss them!	2002-02-25

Written by the terrific husband and wife team, Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta, the Star Wars Young Jedi Knights series are not to be missed! These series of books center on the young twins of Han Solo and Lei Organa, Jacen and Jacen, and their friends, Lowbacca and Tenel Ka, as they journey on the road to becoming Jedi Knights.<br />&quot;Jedi Under Siege&quot;, the sixth book of the YJK series, is the last book of one story arc. The story begins right after book five, &quot;Darkest Knight&quot;, when the young Jedis have learned that the Second Imperium plans an attack upon Yavin 4 where Luke Skywalker's Jedi academy is located. Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, and Lowie rush back to Yavin 4 just in time for when Shadow Academy gets ready to launch their forces. When the academy's shield generator is destroyed, the have only one choice, and that is to fight against the Dark Jedi Master Brakiss, Darkest Knight Zekk, Nightsister Tamith Kai, and their forces. If Skywalker and his Jedis gain victory, that means the end of the Second Imperium. But if they are defeated, then there will be no more hope for the future of the galaxy...<br />I must say that I just love the Young Jedi Knights, which is best read in order! I really like all Star Wars books but this series one of my favorites for the reasons that, 1) the characters are very interesting and close to my age, 2) superbly and well written, and 3) all books are exciting and full of adventure. The four main characters of the books are well likable because each of them have their own personalities, characteristics, and quirks. Jacen with his love for all living plants, animals, insects, etc. Jaina with her mechanical ability and strong willed nature. Tenel Ka, the warrior and true friend. And of course there's Lowie, courageous and strong. <br />This book especially has much excitement and suspense. Terrific ending and close for this one story arc but still you have enough hunger to get your hands onto the next book, &quot;Shards of Alderaan&quot;. The story doesn't focus just on the main characters, you'll be able to see through the eyes of both main characters and other friends and foes. You'll get insight on everyone's thoughts and feelings, plus you will find a few surprises. For example, when Tenel Ka shocks everyone by... but of course I won't spoil the surprise and humor by telling you! You will just have to read the book yourself!<br />So I highly recommend you read all of the fourteen books in order. The series are divided mostly into three parts. The first six books are about the rising force of the Empire and its Dark Jedi Knights. The next five books are about how the Jedis must stop the Diversity Alliance. And the last three books are how the Jedis deal with Czethros and Black Sun. Another Star Wars series I very much recommend are the &quot;Jedi Apprentice&quot; series. Don't miss them!	2002-02-16

That is each Wookiee must prove himself (or herself) in some way. And Sirra has decided to travel to the lowest levels of the planet to get some gossamer fibers from the terrifying and dangerous syren plant. Lowie desperately wants to help her so when Chewbacca goes with him, his friends naturally decide to accompany him. Meanwhile, Zekk who has now been named the Darkest Knight, must prove himself by accomplishing his own mission: to lead a raid on the computer center on Kashyyyk. Jedi Brakiss has total trust in him, though the Nighsister Tamith Ka still doesn't believe Zekk has truly gone over to the Dark Side of the Force. So Zekk must complete another mission... that is, to eliminate the young Jedis Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, and Lowie, whom they know is on the planet.<br />I must say that I just love the Young Jedi Knights, which is best read in order!

It begins where Luke Skywalker makes a hard decision. He decides to train Jacen, Jaina, Lowie, and Tenel Ka to use lightsabers. All four begin their work in constructing their weapons. But Tenel Ka, who relies more on her physical strength than in using the Force, isn't patient enough to make her lightsaber correctly. During a sparring practice with Jacen, to the shock of everyone, her lightsaber explodes and Jacen, caught off guard, (I won't give you the whole details), severes her left arm. Feeling terrible and not wanting to have pity from her friends, Tenel Ka leaves for the Royal Court of Hapes, where her grandmother awaits. But her friends go to her and try to comfort her. Tenel Ka doesn't know how to deal with the situation. With so many mixed emotions, she doesn't know whether she wants to continue her training at the Jedi Academy. As she sorts through her feelings, she and her friends must deal with an assassin whose prime target is... her grandmother, the Matriarch of the Royal Hapan Cluster!<br />I must say that I just love the Young Jedi Knights!

All of the books in the series have lots of action and adventure, plus plenty of humor. I love the whole idea of the Race Against Time series, how Stephen and Uncle Richard always go on an adventure while Stephen's parents are gone, save the world during the weekend, and be able to get back home before his parents get home. Also, I like all the different girls Uncle Richard 'falls in love' with. One of my favorite heroines in the series is Jade Munroe in this book, \\"Evil in Paradise\\". She's tough, smart, and very mysterious.<br />I also love the Kronom K-D2 watches! They're so cool, almost better than any of 007's gadgets. In this book, \\"Evil in Paradise\\", the watches are used a lot for interesting and useful ways to help deal with their enemies.<br />Another of my favorite Race Against Time book is \\"Escape from Raven Castle\\".

Just one look at the beautiful and spirited Jacquine Coyle and Matt Bardoul knew that she was the woman for him. So when he finds out that she and her father and brother are planning to go on a wagon train, he decides to go along too. When he first learns about the wagon train heading for the rich pasture of the Big Horns and the gold which would be plentiful there, he finds nothing wrong. But soon he starts getting an uneasy feeling that something is definitely wrong. The wagon train would be made up of strong and innocent men and their families but they would be lead by a pack of the worst murderers, thieves, and gunslingers. Though Bardoul gets and urgently whispered message telling him not to go, he is still determined to go on the train because of Jacquine and the land at Big Horns. Bardoul doesn't realize that he is getting involved in a very deadly plot where the bad guys would stop at nothing to make sure everything goes according to their plans. Will Bardoul be able to figure out their plans before it's too late?<br />I just love Louis L'Amour's westerns and &quot;Westward the Tide&quot; has got to be one of his bests ever! With plenty of intrigue, suspense, action, and romance, for any L'Amour fan this is a must read. One of the best things I like about this book are the characters which are portrayed. Characters like Matt Bardoul, Jacquine Coyle, Brian Coyle, Clive Massey, Buffalo Murphy, Logan Deane, Ban Hardy, Portugee Philips, and more, L'Amour wonderfully displays the different types of people who made up the American frontier.<br />Other L'Amour books I highly recommend are: All of the Sackett books, including my most favorites, &quot;Jubal Sackett&quot; and &quot;Galloway, &quot;North to the Rails&quot;, &quot;Broken Gun&quot;, &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot;, and &quot;Comstock Lode&quot;.	2002-02-09

With step-by-step instructions, it's a pretty easy book to follow. For kids 9 and older, \\"Draw 50 Horses\\" bye Lee J. Ames is great for drawing in your scrapbook, onto your notebooks, on cards, etc.<br />Some different pictures of horses you can draw are many portraits, at least twelve different types of horses, and plenty of pictures of horses walking, cantering, galloping, grazing, performing, jumping, and more! My favorite pictures to draw are most probably the 'Portrait Rearing', 'Arabian', 'Thoroughbred', 'Pinto', 'Jumping #2', 'Rearing Front View', 'Cantering #2', 'Galloping Side View', and 'Colt'. <br />Of course all of the \\"Draw 50\\" series are great, be sure to check them all out! The books I want are \\"Draw 50 Athletes\\", \\"Draw 50 Famous Faces\\", \\"Draw 50 People of the Bible\\".	2002-02-02

For all \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fans, this book is a must read. A great biography on that great orphan, scholar, soldier, professor, and author of what is considered by many to be the finest book of the 20th Century, J.R.R. Tolkien! <br />There are 125 pages about the life of Tolkien, from when he was born in South Africa, January 3, 1892, to the day he died on September 2, 1973. The book is divided into seven chapters:<br />Chapter 1) Beginnings: This chapter tells about how Tolkien's parents were married and they began their life in South Africa. When both his parents died he lived with Father Francis and when he was old enough, was accepted to Exeter College.<BR>Chapter 2) Oxford and Upward: Tolkien is now a man and has married his love, Edith Bratt. But then comes World War I and he is sent out as a second lieutenant. Luckily he comes back home safely.<BR>Chapter 3) Inklings: Now a professor, Tolkien starts becoming very popular among students and friends. This chapter talks mostly about Tolkien's professor life and about his friends, especially one of his greatest friends, C.S. Lewis. (author of the acclaimed \\"Narnia Chronicles\\".)<BR>Chapter 4) A Hole in the Ground: Tolkien finishes writing his first book, \\"The Hobbit\\". And quite to his surprise, he finds that many, many people simply loved it! Around that time, he also publishes \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" and \\"Mr. Bliss\\". He also beings writing \\"The Silmarillion\\", which he never really finished but his son, Christopher, did.<BR>Chapter 5) His Lordship of the Rings: After 12 years of writing, Tolkien finished his \\"Lord of the Rings\\" story. Published in three books, it won over people and Tolkien is now very popular.<BR>Chapter 6) Just Another Teacher: Even with his fame, Tolkien is still a wonderful teacher and family man. This chapter mostly focuses on his life afterwards.<BR>Chapter 7) End Times: This chapter deals on the last years of Tolkien's life.<br />As I said a terrific book! Definitely for kids 11 and up and aworthy read for adults, too. A nice collection of around 28 pictures which, though black and white, are very clear pictures. A nice introduction in the beginning which I find very interesting. And also at the end of the book, there is a bibliography on books by Tolkien, his books which were edited by others, and also books about Tolkien. The index at the end was a good idea, too. A great read!	2002-01-31

The McGurk Detective Organization - consisting of ten-year-olds McGurk, Willie, Wanda, and Joey - are on a tough case! There has been a murder in their neighborhood; one of the Overshaw's doves has been killed. Ray Williams's cat, Whiskers, stands accused with evidence piled up against him. Unless Whiskers is cleared, he will be sent to the pound to almost certain death. It's up to McGurk and his partners to find the real killer... before the cat runs out of time!<br />I have two of the McGurk mysteries, both of which I enjoy reading immensely! Though it is said to be for readers around 8 years old, I totally disagree. I'm 14 years old and I still love reading McGurk books I have! If you have a chance, don't miss up on the McGurk books, especially \\"The Case of the Slingshot Sniper\\" which is pretty great!<br />Very entertaining and interesting, I could recommend \\"The Case of the Condemned Cat\\" to any of my friends. Measures up to the Encyclopedia Brown mysteries!	2002-01-30

Randall, alias Darn Cat or FBI Agent X-14, is back as he helps the FBI in one of their toughest cases!<br />In \\"Undercover Cat Prowls Again\\", there's a beautiful blonde named Shirley Hutchinson who knows too much, a jewel cutter named Memo who is marked for murder, $300,000 worth of hot gems, and a stop-at-nothing syndicate. But of course, nothing goes the way the FBI would want it to. Agent Zeke Kelso who is allergic to cats has continuing problems with D.C., they can't get to their informant whose life is in danger, Zeke is having problems with his fiance Patti Randall because of Miss Hutchinson, and of course, there are the snoopy neighbors Mrs. MacDougall and Greg Balter. Will the FBI be able to crack their case?<br />The sequel to the Gordons book, \\"That Darn Cat\\" (also published under the title \\"Undercover Cat\\"), \\"Undercover Cat Prowls Again\\" is highly suspenseful and fast moving. Not only does the story is read through the people's eyes, we also get to go through the story through the eyes of D.C.! The Gordons imagine what cats think so well that you can almost believe that they had help from a cat to write the book! I love all of the characters, especially the whole Randall family. How could you not love Patti, Ingrid, and D.C.? This book is best read for kids 12 and older since this book is for mature readers. <br />I also highly recommend \\"That Darn Cat\\" (\\"Undercover Cat\\"). Also, there's a Disney movie out called \\"That Darn Cat\\" which is absolutely a must-watch! It has great stars like Hayley Mills, Dean Jones, Roddy McDowell, and much more!	2002-01-26

It was a town built on deceit and theft, a town corrupted by its own greed, a town that had arrived at this point without realizing how deep were the depths into which it descended.\\"<BR>-The beginning in Chapter 3, \\"The High Graders\\"-<br />Mike Shevlin has after so many years returned to Rafter, only to find out that the only two people in the world who he really cared about, Eli Patterson and Jack Moorman, had been murdered. Not only that, Shevlin discovers that the cattle business there had deteriorated because of the mining going on. And not just had had the mining poisoned the range water, it had also poisoned the town with many people getting involved with high grading. Shevlin is hired by Laine Tennison, the rightful owner of one of the richest mines, to get her high-grade ore back. To do that he'll have to go against many of the most coldest and most ruthless people ever...<br />Louis L'Amour uses a different style than what he usually uses in writing this book. \\"The High Graders\\" has a lot of mystery to it. Lots of different situations come up that don't seem to tie into the plot, or do they...? Also while reading the book you never really know if someone is the good guy or the bad guy. This book keeps you in high-tension suspense, especially the last half of the book where Shevlin is going to 'blow the lid off in this town'. \\"The High Graders\\" is a must read for all Louis L'Amour readers.	2002-01-15

Also some other movies are recommended if the movie was liked. There are also some days which tell about birthdays for movie directors and actors and also gives suggestions on what movies to watch on special occasions.<br />But there's a down side to having this calendar, thus my giving this calendar 4 stars. Since I am still 14 I was a little disappointed to find that most movies which are being reviewed on are mostly all R-rated! I wish there had been more movies on PG-13, PG, or Unrated movies. But other than that, this calendar has lots of movie info which are very interesting.	2002-01-15

The stories are centered on the famous mystery writer Jessica Fletcher who always manages somehow to get involved in a murder.<br />&quot;Brandy and Bullets&quot; takes place in Jessica Fletcher's hometown of Cabot Cove, Maine, where some very interesting events are taking place. The Worrell mansion is being turned into a retreat for a variety of musicians, artists, writers, and other artistic people. Cabot Cove does not know what to make of it, some against it, others, like Jessica, are all for it. But strange things begin to happen, like a mysterious suicide. Then another attempted suicide, then one of Jessica's dear friend disappears. What is going on? Jessica's interest is piqued and she is determined to find out, except she does not entirely realize that she is putting her own life at stake...<br />Since this is the first and only &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; book I've read, I cannot compare it with any of the other books in the series. But I must confess, I was a little disappointed. First of all, it wasn't really a murder mystery, nothing interesting really took place. And plus it wasn't as suspenseful and exciting like the TV series. But in its defense I must say that the conclusion was pretty surprising, but of course I won't say anymore to spoil it.<br />I still might try another one of the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; books, &quot;Blood of the Vine&quot; probably because that sounds the most interesting. But if you are thinking of reading any of the books, I suggest you pass up &quot;Brandy and Bullets&quot; and read some other ones first.	2002-01-11

I am probably one of the few people who has read &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; AFTER the movie came out. The reason is because I didn't find any interest in it at all. But after seeing the movie and finding it very interesting, I wanted to read the first book to see what it was like. And I must confess, I found the world of Harry Potter to be rather fun!<br />Ever since he could remember, Harry Potter had been living with his awful Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and abominable cousin Dudley. He cannot remember his parents and does not know how he came about having the strange lightening scar on his forehead. Then surprisingly, on his 10th birthday, he finds out from the giant Hagrid that he is really a wizard! And not only that, he is now being offered to be enrolled into Hogwarts School of Wizardry, a very distinguished and best school. There, Harry makes friends Ron Weasely and Hermione Granger and begins to learn the art of wizardry. But something is amiss, something that concerns a mysterious trapdoor guarded by a terrible three-headed dog. And that something has something to do with Voldemort, the evil wizard, and... the sorcerer's stone.<br />A totally enchanting book, it's one of the best fantasies I've ever read. J.K. Rowling has made up a world of imagination you could never dream of. Parents who are worried about the books involving wizardry should be warned though in this way. If children cannot understand that there is a difference between reality and fiction, imaginary places, and magic, I suggest that they should know that. Other than that, I think it's fun for kids to read, mostly around the ages of 8 and or older. I cannot say anything about the other books in the series though because I have yet to read them.<br />But I have to agree with some people who said that the Harry Potter series aren't the best. &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; are so far the best fantasies ever written of its kind though these books are mostly recommended to older kids and adults. Another series that draws greater attention for all ages are the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; by C.S. Lewis (by the way, writer J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were the greatest of friends!). So if you have enjoyed the Harry Potter books, I greatly recommend all books by J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.s are mostly recommended to older kids and adults.

Lori Wick certainly is one of my favorite Christian/Romance writers, coming up to a close second to Dee Henderson. And probably my favorite books from Lori Wick are the Kensington Chronicles.<br />&quot;Wings of the Morning&quot; is about young Victoria &quot;Smokey&quot; Simmons, captain of one of the fastest ship of the Atlantic, the 'Aramis'. When her father, the famous Clancy, had died and left her alone in the world, she asks God to give her strength. Three years have passed and Smokey begins dreaming of life away from the sea. She wants to have a home and raise a family. When she meets another sea captain, Dallas Knight, she believes that her dreams can finally come true. Dallas, also hopelessly in love with her, shares her dreams. But when a scheming and evil pirate comes into their lives, Smokey and Dallas' hopes for the future may come to an end. Will they have the strength to overcome these painful events and to trust themselves into their Father in heaven?<br />A truly marvelous tale taking place in the mid-1800s, &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot; will have you swept into a world of romance and suspense. I love the wonderful characters of Smokey, who is young and shy yet has great spirit, and Dallas, who will do anything to protect her. They are so real that it is very hard not to like them and to hope they have their dreams fulfilled. <br />The other three books of the Kensington Chronicles are &quot;The Hawk and the Jewel&quot;, &quot;Who Brings Forth the Wind&quot;, and &quot;The Knight and the Dove&quot;, all of them filled with romance and suspense, plus they all are about people who love and honor their God. My suggestion to you is that if you have never read any of Lori Wick's books, you should start with these four books.<br />And if you are looking for other terrific Christian/Romance books, I recommend all books by Dee Henderson, including the O'Malley Series, &quot;Danger in the Shadows&quot;, and the Uncommon Heroes Series. But be ready for suspense, intrigue, and mystery, because these books are filled with them!	2002-01-11

So for this Christmas of course I got three books about this movie: &quot;Fellowship of the Rings Photo Guide&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide&quot;, and &quot;Fellowship of the Ring Insider's Guide&quot;.<br />This Insider's Guide is mostly aimed for younger kids. This 96 pages book has 16 pages of color photographs, history of J.R.R. Tolkien, history on Peter Jackson, behind-the-scenes, about cast and crew, and much, much more! Some may be disappointed though because the book being in a way short and not containing enough stuff. But the major reason for my giving only 4 stars is that though there are 16 pages filled with 34 nice color photos and yet, there are other small pictures in the book. The thing is, the rest of the pictures are all in fuzzy, very unclear black and white photos! If they were going to put photos in this Insider's Guide, they could have at least made them nice, clean color pictures!<br />My favorite part is the part around the end where they were talking about the accidents that happened on the set. Actor Sean Astin (who plays Samwise Gangee) had a huge wooden loom for making tapestries fell and hit him on the head. Ever since that, his hobbit friends would make him jump by pointing behind him and shouting, &quot;Loom!&quot;<br />If you're thinking of getting a &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; book based on the new movie, I recommend this book if you can overlook the most of the pretty bad photos like I described. I still love the &quot;Insider's Guide&quot; and I'm sure you'll like it, too.<br />Here are two other books I can recommend you to get. &quot;The Lord of the Rings Official Movie Guide&quot; is a much bigger book, 118 pages long with plenty, PLENTY of beautiful, color photos! Not only that but it also has lots of information on behind the scenes trivia, background, short biographies on cast and crew, and more. The &quot;Photo Guide&quot; is aimed for kids and is like a picture story book but still enjoyable by all with amazing photographs and lines from the movie.	2001-12-31

Since I have not yet been able to go see the movie since the movie won't be coming out till April here in Japan, I must satisfy myself with books that are out on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. <br />This is not necessarily what I would call a &quot;Photo Guide&quot; but it's like a story book with plenty of pictures. Though it is said that this book is for ages 9-12, this book can be enjoyed by any ages of people. Not only does it have over 70 amazing color photos, it also includes previously unseen images and direct quotes from the movie. My favorite part of the book is probably page 33, &quot;The Nine Companions&quot;, which shows pictures and quotes from Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir.<br />Very enjoyable and mesmerizing, I can recommend this book to anyone! I love this book very much and it was a great Christmas present for me!	2001-12-27

The third book of the O'Malley series, &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot; will just captivate you! And if you've read all three books and loved them as much as I do, I'm sure you feel a part of the O'Malley family now!<br />The O'Malley family consists of seven brothers and sister, three boys and four girls. Since they were little they had been in the same orphanage and when they got out of the orphanage, they decided to 'adopt' each other, taking the name O'Malley as their family name. They all have very important jobs, Marcus is a U.S. Marshal, Kate a negotiator for hostage situations, botched-up robberies, etc., Jennifer is a doctor, Jack a fireman, Rachel a trauma psychologist, and Lisa is a forensic pathologist. This story is about Lisa O'Malley, 'the truth seeker'.<br />U.S. Marshal Quinn Diamond has for twenty years been searching for the person who murdered his father. His only link is the disappearance of Amy Ireland, a neighbor of his ranch where Quinn's father was killed. And Quinn is still searching for her.<br />Lisa O'Malley, forensic pathologist has worked crime scenes in Chicago for many years. When she is asked by her boss to look over the files of unsolved cases, she of course accepts and digs into the sea of evidence and connections between victims that are faint but are now fading.<br />Quinn and Lisa's cases seem to come together by some threads of evidence. As Quinn spends more time around Lisa, he finds himself falling in love with her and prays every day for her salvation. Lisa is also beginning to fall for Quinn but has seen to much pain and death to believe in God and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And there is also the deep secret which Lisa has been hiding for years, even from her family. Quinn is determined to find out about it. <br />Now there is a killer out to stop Quinn and Lisa from discovering which has been remained buried for years. He'll stop at nothing, escalating from notes... then to arson. But where will he stop at? Lisa and Quinn are afraid that he'll stop at nothing, even murder...<br />The characters are so lovable! From the silent and strong Quinn with his steadfast faith in God, to Lisa who holds a heavy secret in her heart which keeps her from believing in the one person who can help her. Who can help from wanting to find out more about them, and hoping that they would fall in love? As with all of Dee Henderson books, &quot;The Truth Seeker&quot; is well written and can't be put down. Plus you get to find out a lot more about police investigations and forensic studies. Dee Henderson must have put a lot of work into all of the O'Malley books.<br />The first in the O'Malley series is &quot;The Negotiator&quot; in which the main character is Lisa's sister, Kate O'Malley. The next book after that is &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in which the main character is Marcus O'Malley, the oldest of the O'Malley's. Then comes &quot;The Protector&quot; whose main character is Jack O'Malley. I just can't wait to read it! I wonder who Dee Henderson would write about next? Rachel, Stephen, or Jennifer?

Mostly for reader 9 to 12, all of the books in the series have lots of action and adventure, plus plenty of humor. I love the whole idea of the Race Against Time series, how Stephen and Uncle Richard always go on an adventure while Stephen's parents are gone, save the world during the weekend, and be able to get back home before his parents get home. But like I said, O didn't enjoy &quot;Search for Mad Jack's Crown&quot; as much as I did the other books. I prefer &quot;Escape from Raven Castle&quot;, &quot;Trapped in the USSR&quot;, and &quot;Evil in Paradise&quot;.<br />I love the Kronom K-D2 watches! They're so cool, almost better than any of 007's gadgets. In this book though, the watches are used that much.<br />All of the books are limited availability but if you ever get have a chance to borrow these books at the library or buy them, I'm sure you won't regret reading the Race Against Time books!

Lady-in-waiting Kate Sutton, finds out that her sister, Alicia, impulsively sent a complaint letter to the Queen Mary about the Princess Elizabeth. Kate finds herself blamed for her sister's actions and is exiled to Elvenwood, 'the Perilous Gard' to be kept under watch by the master of the isolated castle, Geoffrey Heron. She finds the place shrouded with mystery and is intrigued by the handsome but strangely silent brother of Geoffrey, Christopher. She hears rumors that Christopher had killed his niece to ensure that he would get the inheritance from his brother. Kate, determined to find out the truth, stumbles into a dark secret about the People of the Hill. Kate and Christopher are quite suddenly plunged into the otherworldly province where they just might lose their lives...<br />Totally wonderful book! I'm not in the least surprised this is a Newberry Honor book! I must warn you though that this book is for ages 12 and up. Not at all appropriate for kids younger than 12. But because of the intriguing plot, the well-developed characters, and the fact that it is so much fun to read makes it even enjoyable for adults!<br />The characters of Kate Sutton and Christopher Heron are wonderful! I immediately fell in love with them. They are both stubborn, very determined, and faithful friends. The humor and banter are very witty and makes me laugh all the time! Though I have to tell you that the book is over-all pretty serious.<br />I strongly recommend &quot;The Perilous Gard&quot; and I'm most assured that everyone who will read it will put it on your favorites list!	2001-12-15

The best thing of the are Uncle Richard's and Stephen's watches. They're sooooooo cool though I can't say too much about them, you'll have to read the books yourself.

Shea, who is half Elvin, discovers he is really of the bloodline of Shannara. Allanon tells him that the evil Warlock Lord is planning to take over the world. And since the Warlock Lord is of the spirit world, there is only way to defeat him... by having the sole heir of Shannara take up the sword of Shannara which is the only weapon which can kill him. And Shea is the last and only heir of Shannara! Together the three of them with the help of Balinor the Prince of Callahorn, Menion Leah the Prince of Leah, Hendel the Dwarf, and the Elves Durin and Dayel, who are the cousins of Elf King Eventine, must travel to the Druid's keep of Paranor to get the Sword of Shannara. But little do they know that the Warlock Lord is already having his army ready for war against the stronghold of Tyrsis and that he has already sent part of his army to take hold of Paranor... also, he has sent his Skull Bearers to destroy Shea...<br />Terrific tale but as I said it is very much like J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. It's not just the plot but also the characters are very alike. For exampel you can easily think of Allanon as Wizard Gandalf, Shea as Hobbit Frodo, Flick as the faithful Sam, Hendel can relate to Gimli the Dwarf, the Elf brothers are much like Elf Legolas, and many more of the characters. <br />People who love J.R.R. Tolkien might be a little exasperated reading this book, finding the two books so alike, and yet, though I totally think &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is fantastic, I was able to enjoy this book. Though I must warn you that the first 170 pages are pretty boring and I had a hard time to keep on reading. For this reason I gave the book 4 stars. But after reading a lot more, a found I couldn't put the book down!<br />My favorite character is Panamon Creel, the one-handed thief. Though he was very arrogant and proud, he was still a fun and interesting character. Two other characters is Menion Leah and Shirl Ravenlock, both whom fall in love later in the book. Menion Leah is such a faithful friend and Shirl is very devoted to him and stayed with him even though danger was very close.<br />So all-in-all, I strongly recommend the book though please don't be too disappointed in the very slow beginning and how very much alike it is to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.	2001-12-15

The characters are all great, with the main character, Major Tappan Duvarney who is handsome, brave, fast with a gun, yet smart enough to know when not to use it.

It's up to Sam now to save his master Frodo. It's a good thing he has the Ring of Doom with him. When Sam finally is able to free Frodo, they must continue their quest to destroy the Ring, before the evil Sauron uses it to his own purposes, to cover all the lands with his Darkness. But Frodo is starting to weaken with the weight and power of the Ring. Will he be able to complete his quest? Meanwhile, King Theoden and his Rohan forces, along with Merry the hobbit, travel to Minas Tirith to help King Denethor fight off Sauron's forces of Men and Orcs. And Aragorn the Ranger (or is he...?), Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and the Rangers decide to go to Minas Tirith... by the Paths of Dead!<br />A truly great conclustion to such a terrific series. J.R.R. Tolkien certainly made these books so interesting and realistic. You must read the Appendixes at the end of the book, it tells about all of the histories of Men, Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits, and more. Also gives timelines of the 2nd Age, 3rd Age, and more.<br />One of my most favorite characters is Legolas the Elf, one important reason is because he is an Elf. Somehow Elves have always fascinated and interested me, with their mysterious, quiet but strong ways. I love how he and Gimli the Dwarf are the best of friends and how they're always together and inseparable. I also love Pippin the Hobbit, he's so cheerful, kind, but always seems to always get into trouble! Also I think that Faramir the Prince is also a good character. Son of the King Denethor, in the eyes of his father is unworthy because he is compared with his brother, Boromir, who had been killed.<br />I can't honestly say which of the three books in the trilogy is the best.

The Company is faced with a choice, whether to continue on with Frodo the hobbit to Mount Doom to destroy the ring, or travel to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, to help fight the evil Sauron's forces. But in the end, Frodo secretly goes off alone with his faithful hobbit friend, Sam, to Mount Doom. The other members split up to try to find them.<br />Here is where &quot;The Two Towers&quot; story begins. Boromir is killed while trying to protect hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orcs. The three other members of the Company, Aragorn the Ranger, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf, set out to rescue them. They realize that the orcs are not of the forces of Sauron, but someone else. Then a member of the Fellowship Gandalf the wizard, whom they thought was killed, tells them that the orcs are working under the wizard Saruman. Before Saruman had been good but had turned to evil and wants the powers of the Ring. Gandalf tells them that Merry and Pippin have escaped are in the capable hands of Treebeard and the Ents. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to instead go to the lands of Rohan to help King Theoden in the upcoming war from the forces of Saruman. Here ends part one of the book. The second part tells about Frodo and Sam's quest to the land of Mordor with the unexpected help of... Gollum!<br />J.R.R.

It's one of those classics where you can just keep on reading on and on and you don't want to finish. Yes, this book just captivated me with the adventure, suspense, excitement, and humor.<br />&quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; is the first book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. Hobbit Frodo Baggins, the nephew of the famous Bilbo Baggins (read J.R.R. Tolkiens prelude to the trilogy, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;) is visited by the wizard Gandalf. When Bilbo had left years ago he had left his magical and mystical Ring which he had taken from Gollum in his earlier adventures to Frodo. From Gandalf Frodo learns that this Ring is actually the Ring of Power from the Elven lore:<br />One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,<br />One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<br />Lost for centures, if this ring should fall back into the hands of the evil Sauron, he would be enabled to destory everything which is good in Middle-earth, bringing the land into darkness. Frodo and his hobbit friends Sam, Pippin, and Merry travel to the Rivendell to seek counsel from the Elf Elrond on what to do with the ring. There he finds out that he must destroy the Ring and to do that, must cast it into Mount Doom, located at the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom. Thus the Fellowship is created to help Frodo in his journey. The Fellowship consists of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn the Ranger who is not what he seems, Legolas of the Elves of Mirkwood, Boromir a man of Gondor, and Gimli the dwarf from the Lonely Mountains. Together the nine set out for Mount Doom. But the way is treacherous and the dark, evil Ringwraiths are searching for them.<br />But the story doesn't end here. If you have never read the books and you want to try it out, I suggest that you get all three books, not just the first one because this. If you like it, I assure you that you will be in agony at the end to find out what happens. The books are very addictive and it's very hard to stop at just &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;.

This book was written by the famous Western writer, Louis L'Amour. Louis L'Amour has written over a hundred books, including the famous Sackett novels. The setting of this story is in the mid-1800's, during the gold rush in America. The story is told in Virginia City, Nevada.<br />The main character is Val Trevallion, a young man of twenty-four with a harsh past. Both of his parents were killed when he was young and he has taken it upon himself to have revenge on the killers. He is a quiet man but very strong because of his work in mines. Though he has not had the best education, he is very smart. Grita Redaway is Val's friend from his past. Her parents were also killed by the same people who killed Val's parents. She is a very beautiful and an intelligent actress. She is independent though with a streak of stubbornness in her. Al Hesketh is the villain of the story. He is a cruel and wicked man, only thinking of himself and how he can become rich. <br />The story begins in Cornwall, England in the year 1859. Val is fourteen-years-old when his father and mother decide to move to America. His father wants to work his own mine in California. He saves enough money so they go to America by boat. When they reached Gunwalloe, the Trevallions decide to travel to California with another family, the Redaways. The Redaways have only one daughter, Grita, who is eight-years-old. A few days before they leave, Val's father goes to buy supplies a few miles away.  Suddenly, drunken rustlers attack the wagons in which Val and Grita's mothers are in. The drifters kill the mothers then beat up Mr. Redaway. During the whole time, Val and Grita are hidden nearby; Val protecting Grita and shielding her from the sight. After they leave, killing Mr. Redaway, Val and Grita go find Mr. Trevallion. After the dead are buried, Mr. Trevallion, though heartbroken, decides to carry on to California with Val while Grita goes to live with her aunt. But onthe way to California, Val's father is killed by the same men who had killed his mother. Val swears to have revenge on the murderers. Ten years go by, during which Val shoots two of the people who were involved in the murders. Val then realizes that he has wasted his life and decides to settle down and have his own mine in Virginia City, Nevada, where the Comstock Lode is. He gets good land and finds some silver in his mines. But trouble seems to follow him everywhere. He finds out that Grita is in big trouble, in which the remaining men who murdered his parents are involved.<br />Love this book, and is one of my favorite L'Amour books. Louis L'Amour is the type of writer that, whatever he writes, you'll know before-hand that you'll love them. &quot;Comstock Lode&quot; is no exception. Some other of my favorite L'Amour books are:<br />*North to the Rails*<BR>*Sackett Series*<BR>*Matagorda*<BR>*Crossfire Trail*<br />...and this list can go on and on and on!	2001-11-27

First of the Appomattox Saga, a series about the Civil War in Virginia, this book is very realistic. It is a novel with much history, romance, and adventure in it. Part One of the book is written in the summer of 1840, part two in 1849, and part three and four in 1859 and 1860.<br />Clay Rocklin, a headstrong and passionate man, is the main character of the story. He is rough and very competitive with his cousin, Gideon Rocklin, and loves to win. Having a restless spirit, he drinks and goes out all the time, which shames his family greatly. Later on though, he finds the Lord and starts a new life following Christ. Gideon Rocklin is Clay's cousin, who is almost an exact opposite of him. He is steadfast, responsible, and at the top of his class at West Point, a famous military school. He falls in love with Melanie Benton and they get married, much to Clay's dislike, since he loves Melanie, too. Melora Yancy is the young girl who leads Clay to Jesus. She is pretty, bright, and loves to read. <br />The story begins in the summer of 1840 in Virginia, when nineteen-year-old Gideon Rocklin, from the North Rocklin's, comes for a visit. The Rocklins were separated into the Southern and Northern Rocklins, when one of the Rocklins married a Northern woman. Nineteen-year-old Clay of the Southern Rocklins, is in love with Melanie Benton, as is Gideon. Melanie at first cannot decide between them and so flirts with both of them, trying to keep both of their attentions. But when Melanie finds out that she is in love with Gideon, she agrees to marry him. Clay, in frustration and anger, starts drinking, gambling, and shames the family. Will Clay ever have peace in his heart? And with the coming Civil War, will he be able to know where his loyalties lie?<br />Terrific book, as I said very realistic. I read this book in one night for I was in agony with Clay and was wondering throughout the whole book whether he would ever have peace. My favorite character is probably the calm and pretty Melora Yancy. I do hope she comes out more in all of the rest of the books in the Appomattox Series. I have also read the second book, &quot;Gate of His Enemies&quot;. Unfortunately I still haven't read any of the other books though I hope to get them soon!	2001-11-24
US	42636479	R14FF7XCI8UMLF	0310205026	313211401	In the Hall of the Dragon King (The Dragon King Trilogy, Book 1)	Books	5	30	34	N	N	The best book of the Dragon King Trilogy	Stephen R. Lawhead's book, &quot;In the Hall of the Dragon King&quot; is a fantasy novel. The story is set during what seems like the Middle Ages where there are kings and queens, knights and lords, and battles against good and evil. <br />Quentin is the main character of the story. In the beginning, he is a fifteen-year-old acolyte to the god Ariel but later becomes a follower of God. He is very headstrong, courageous, and kind. He is always helping others and makes many friends. Durwin the Holy Hermit is the one who teaches Quentin about God. Durwin is a hermit who lives in the woods, healing and helping the sick. He is very helpful and caring and loves to tell others about God. Toli is a Jher, a race of people who live in the woods. He leaves his tribe to be a servant of Quentin. He is not only a servant, but also Quentin's best friend. Toli is a quiet person with a crafty and quick mind. Prince Jaspin is the wicked brother of the Dragon King of Mesandor. He is crafty and mean but also a coward. He plots against the king with the help of Nimrood the Necromancer. Nimrood is an evil magician who calls on the dark side for his powers. He is evil, cruel, and a lunatic for power.<br />Very late in the night, Quentin awakes suddenly. He hears the priests talking in the temple a goes to find out what happened. A morally wounded knight had stumbled into the temple where Quentin serves as an acolyte to the god Ariel. The knight says his name is Ronsard and that he has a most important message to deliver to Queen Alinea at the city of Askelon. Since because of his injury, he pleads for one of them to send to message. Quentin decides to deliver the message for him. But though that means he can never come back to them temple, he still insists he will go. So one of the priests named Biorkis, tells him to go and on the way ask help from a certain man named Durwin. Quentin leaves on the knight's horse Balder and sets off for Durwin's cottage. He arrives there and sees not onlyDurwin there, but also Durwin's friend Heidi. When they hear that Quentin has a message from Ronsard for the queen, they both suddenly get excited. Theido says he will go with Quentin to Askelon. They go to Escalon trying to slip there unnoticed but Prince Jaspin recognizes Theido. You see Theido is really a lord who was made an outlaw by Prince Jaspin! Prince Japan's henchmen catch Theido but Quentin escapes. Quentin takes his message to Queen Alinea. When he delivers the message and the queen reads it, she tells him that Nimrood the Necromancer is holding the Dragon King prisoner. Queen Alinea knows that if they don't free the king, Nimrood and his accomplice, Prince Jaspin, will kill him. The queen then frees Theido, and goes to Durwin's cottage with Quentin and her warder, Trenn.  Then, the four of them flee to an ancient city called Dekra, but they find out that Prince Jaspin has put three Harriers on their trail. Harriers are barbarous and savage people who hunt down people and bring them back, dead or alive. Will they be able to make it to Dekra to obtain help to find the king? And even if they do, will they be able to free him from the evil clutches of Nimrood the Necromancer?<br />Great trilogy, one of my favorites of fantasy novels. It's very exciting and suspenseful, while at the same time it has a Christian moral to it. My favorite part is in the beginning where Quentin tries to give the message to the Queen. Also love it when Quentin and his band try to free the king. Enjoyable for everyone, kids and adults alike though my opinion is it is best for teenagers.<br />For other fantasy books like &quot;In the Hall of the Dragon King&quot;, I recommend the Narnia Chronicles and the Lord of the Rings series. These books are also terrific!	2001-11-21
US	42636479	RF7R1STBAC4W0	0553214020	996520695	The Scarlet Pimpernel	Books	5	6	8	N	N	&quot;That demmed illusive Pimpernel...&quot;	&quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; was written by Baroness Orczy, the setting of the story is during the French Revolution, 1792. The French Revolution is well under hand; hundreds of aristocrats are being put to death through the guillotine. All in Paris is in terror of the guillotine and many of the aristocrats try to flee but are always caught until a band of brave and noble Englishmen risk their lives to protect the innocent. This group of men are led by a mysterious man known only as 'the Scarlet Pimpernel'. No one knows who he is and the French Revolutionists want to know badly so that they can capture and kill him. One of the leaders, Chauvelin, comes up with a plan to use a former citoyenne of France, Marguerite St. Just, as a spy. Now that she is married to one of the most fashionable and richest Englishmen, Sir Percy of Blackeney, she is the pivot of social London who hears and sees everything. She might find out who the Scarlet Pimpernel is. Though she refuses and says she wants to have nothing to do with the Revolution, Chauvelin blackmails her with a signed letter proving that her brother, Armand St. Just, is in league with the Scarlet Pimpernel. If she does not cooperate with him, Chauvelin will produce the letter to the head of the French council and Armand will be put to death. Marguerite, seeing no choice, agrees reluctantly. She has had many problems of her own. When she married Percy, everyone was gossiping why ever would she marry such a fop and an idiot when she could have chosen to marry anyone. But Marguerite is in love with Percy, because she feels that he is wearing a mask, and that being a fop is just a façade. A terrible thing happens on their wedding day because Percy finds out that Marguerite was involved in the execution of the whole St. Cyr family when she tells the Committee that Marquis de St. Cyr is a spy for the Scarlet Pimpernel. Though she pleads that she is innocent, which is true, Percy does not believe her and is cold towardsher. So thus Marguerite has no one to turn to when Chauvelin blackmails her. At the Prince of Waless ball, she finds out that the Scarlet Pimpernel will be waiting for two of his accomplices in the library at the ball. Will Marguerite betray the Scarlet Pimpernel, or will she hand over the life of her dear brother, Armand?<br />I love this book because it has plenty of adventure, action, mystery, suspense, and romance. One of my favorite parts of the book is where Sir Percy recites his poem, &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel.&quot;<br />&quot;They seek him here, they seek him there,<BR>Those Frenchies seek him everywhere,<BR>Is he in heaven or is he in hell,<BR>That demmed illusive Pimernel.&quot;<br />Baroness Orczy made me feel for the characters. When Marguerite was scorned by the Comtesse de Tournay, I felt so bad for her and when Chauvelin is about to go into the library to find the Scarlet Pimpernel, I was in such suspense as to whether he would find him or not. This is a book which can be enjoyed by everyone. One of those classics that must, MUST, be read! <br />If you enjoyed the book, I strongly recommend the 1982 version of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. With great actors Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymore, this is one of my favorite films to watch even after watching it so many times. There's also a 1934 version with Leslie Howard though I'm sorry to say I haven't seen it yet. Do want to see it though!	2001-11-21
US	42636479	R2O87A9MNHZ7QU	0449704378	458323947	The Light in the Forest	Books	3	10	13	N	N	Not one of my favorites yet very interesting to read	\\"The Light in the Forest\\", written by writer Conrad Richter is a very famous Young Adult Fiction book written in 1953. The setting is in the wilderness of the early American frontier, during the time where the white people and Indians were not necessarily enemies, yet were wary and scared of each other. The main character in this book is True Son, his real name John Butler.<br />John Butler was only four years old when he was captured by the Lenni Lenape Indians. Instead of being killed, he was kept alive and adopted into the tribe by the warrior chief Cuyloga. John Butler is renamed True Son, and grows up to think, feel, and fight like an Indian. He does not remember anything of his life before he lived with the Indians, nor does he care because he hates the white people. Now he is fifteen years old and the Indians make a treaty with the white people, agreeing to return all white captives to their own people. True Son is very angry and does not want to return to his people. He thinks like all Indians that white people are evil and that the Indian way is the right way. He tries at first to hide but is soon caught and because he tries every opportunity to escape, they tie him up and bring him forcefully to Peshtank, or renamed Paxton by the white people. There he goes back to live with his real father, mother, aunt, and younger brother. But True Son despises all of his family and relatives, especially his narrow-minded uncle, Uncle Wilse, who believes that all of the 'savages' should be killed. Only True Son's younger brother, Gordie, is somewhat his friend. True Son feels like he is a captive living with his family, he does not agree with their ways and scorns them. But just as he was about to become settled down a little bit, Half Arrow, True Son's Indian cousin, comes to visit him with very bad tidings.<br />Like I said, this book is not really one of my favorite books to read, though really interesting. Also, when I read this book I fell so depressed thinking about how narrow-minded the people were back in early American history, both Indians and the white people. Yet that is why I think the book is very interesting because it describes well how life was back when the Indians and the white people were enemies. I do not think younger kids will enjoy this book much though I think that maybe older children should at least read \\"The Light in the Forest\\" one time.	2001-11-21
US	42636479	R2ZFXXSF2X07EN	0671655604	366326040	COBRA	Books	5	11	12	N	N	The first of the Cobra Series, and what I think is the best!	&quot;Cobra - the most deadly guerrilla warriors mankind has ever produced.&quot; The Cobra series are based on the lives of the Moreau generations. The first book, &quot;Cobra&quot;, is about the life of Johnny Moreau, one of the first Cobras.<br />The alien Troft forces have taken over the colony worlds of Adirondack and Silvern. Outnumbered and on the defensive, the humans on Earth make a decision to not atttack the aliens from space, but on the ground. Thus the Cobra units were created, a guerilla force whose weapons and other devices are surgically implanted, invisible to the human eye yet deadly. When Johnny Moreau signs up for the army, he is surprised to be among the few to be made into Cobras. He is sent to Adirondack to fight the Trofts. But being a Cobra isn't at all what Johnny expects it to be, and must learn the uses and abuses of his abilities. From Trainee to Warrior, Veteran to Loyalist, then finally to become from Politician to Statesman, Johnny will learn what it really is to become... a Cobra.<br />Timothy Zahn is truly one of my most favorite Science Fiction writers and &quot;Cobra&quot; is a truly good example of one of his best books. I love all the twists and turns in the plot, so many surprises at every corner. And I really liked the character of Johnny Moreau. He is smart, thoughtful, and always tried to help others. I felt so sorry for him when he returned home after the war. Everyone was afraid of him and despised him for being a Cobra. Another of my favorite characters in the books is Cally Halloran, another Cobra from Johnny's unit.<br />As I said, this is the first book of the Cobra Series. The next books are &quot;Cobra Strike&quot; and &quot;Cobra Bargain&quot;. &quot;Cobra Strike&quot; is about Johnny's son, Justin Moreau, who becomes a Cobra and is sent on a dangerous mission to an unknown planet. &quot;Cobra Bargain&quot; is about the daughter of Justin whose dream of becoming the first woman Cobra comes true. Though these books are very hard to find, if you can get them, I'm sure you'll love them!	2001-11-15

Ender is a child prodigy and there is a reason the government want to send him to Battle School at the Belt. Humanity is under the constant threat from an alien race called the Buggers. No one seems to know anything about them but people on earth believe that after being defeated long time ago, the Buggers will try again to attack the humans. The people are ready, they have the troops, the weapons, the technology, but they still don't have one very important thing, they don't have a commander to lead them. And their only hope rests on young Ender's. From the moment he reaches Battle School, his life is strictly disciplined by mind games, isolation, patience, computers, and mock battles. As the invasion draws closer and closer and Ender must be pushed to his limits. Will Ender be able to endure the pressure?<br />Full of surprises, twists and turns, &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is for all science fiction lovers. Very realistic and fun to read. The ending will really shock you... I was!! My favorite parts are probably all the mock-battles and the very end. The only problem I have in this book, the reason for only 4 stars, is because of the language. But except for that I would have given this book 5 stars and I recommend this book for older kids and adults who can handle it and some of the violence. The other books of the Ender's Saga is &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot;, &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;, and &quot;Shadow of Hegemon&quot;.	2001-11-09

Suspense, action, love, humor, faith in God, excitement, mystery... these are the elements used by Dee Henderson in book 2 of the O'Malley series, &quot;The Guardian&quot;. As I said, I can recommend this book to be read by ANYONE! It's fantastically written. The O'Malley series are about the O'Malley family. The O'Malley consists of seven brothers and sisters, three boys and four girls. Since they were little they had been in the same orphanage and when they got out of the orphanage, they decided to 'adopt' each other, taking the name O'Malley as their family name. They all have very important jobs, Marcus is a U.S. Marshal, Kate a negotiator for hostage situations, botched-up robberies, etc., Jennifer is a doctor, Jack a fireman, Rachel a trauma psychologist, and Lisa is a forensic pathologist. This story is about Marcus, the guardian of the family.<br />U.S. Marshal Marcus O'Malley is helping with security at Chicago Jefferson Renaissance Hotel, making sure nothing goes wrong at a judicial conference. During the banquet, political speech writer Shari Hanford, stumbles into security control center by accident. There she meets Marcus and he leads her back to the ballroom. Both finding each other attractive, they set a date to have coffee the next morning. They part happily anticipating seeing each other again. Little do they know that they would see each other again sooner than they expect, under very grim circumstances.<br />Judge Carl Whitmore, friend of the Hanford family, is unexpectedly chosen to be the next Supreme Court justice. He is murdered that very night, killed in cold blood. But the killer did not expect to have Shari open the door from the adjoining room while he is still there. He fires at her but she is saved by her brother, Josh, who pushes her out of the way. Josh is hit in the shoulder and Shari's father is shot in the chest. The killer escapes and U.S. Marshal Marcus and others must make sure he is caught and brought to justice. And one more thing, they must protect Shari because the killer wants her dead, for she saw his face. Marcus must guard Shari from danger while at the same time begins to fall in love with her. But Marcus is uncomfortable with Shari and her praying to God. He had once been a believer when he was very young and had prayed all the time. Then he had been hurt when his mother had died and didn't believe in prayer anymore. Can Shari teach Marcus to believe in God and prayer?<br />I just loved the characters of Marcus and Shari. They are so realistic with such good characteristics such as kind, loving, trustworthy, patient, and caring. But this story just isn't about Marcus and Shari, it also involves the O'Malley's, Dave Richman (Kate O'Malley's boyfriend), and Marcus' partner, Quinn Diamond. I love the banter between Lisa O'Malley and Quinn! This book focuses on prayer and I absolutely agree with everything it says about prayer in this book. Just because God doesn't answer you doesn't mean that He's not listening. God is always there and He has a plan and a time for everything. We just have to trust in Him.<br />The first in the O'Malley series is &quot;The Negotiator&quot; in which the main character is Marcus' sister, Kate O'Malley. This is also another great book! Then after this book is &quot;The Truth-Seeker&quot; with Lisa O'Malley then &quot;The Protector&quot; with Jack O'Malley. Can't wait to read those, too! Other books by Dee Henderson is &quot;Danger in the Shadows&quot; (written before &quot;The Negotiator&quot; whose main character is Dave Richman's sister, Sara Richman) and &quot;True Devotion&quot;, the first in the Uncommon Heroes Series. I highly recommend all of these books!! Trust me, they're all fantastic!	2001-11-09

And will the Redwall animals be able to defeat Cluny?<br />This is the first book written in the Redwall Series, though if you were to read the books in time order, books like \\"Martin the Warrior\\", \\"Mossflower\\", \\"Mariel of Redwall\\", and \\"The Bellmaker\\" are before this book. As with all of the Redwall Series, I love the hare, Basil Stag Hare, with his military ways, his enormous appetite, his humor, and his faithfulness to stick with his friends. Really like Silent Sam, the squirrel, too! Also love all the riddles and puzzles in which Matthias and Methuselah had to solve to find the sword.	2001-11-02

Dee Henderson is probably... no, not probably but she IS my favorite Christian writer!! \\"The Negotiator\\" is probably my favorite of the books she has written (though I still haven't read \\"The Truth-Seeker\\" or \\"The Protector\\" yet so I'll have to see!). This book is the first of the O'Malley series. The O'Malley family consists of seven brothers and sister, three boys and four girls. Since they were little they had been in the same orphanage and when they got out of the orphanage, they decided to `adopt' each other, taking the name O'Malley as their family name. They all have very important jobs, Marcus is a U.S. Marshal, Kate a negotiator for hostage situations, botched-up robberies, etc., Jennifer is a doctor, Jack a fireman, Rachel a trauma psychologist, and Lisa is a forensic pathologist. This story is about Kate O'Malley, the negotiator.<br />The story begins when while Kate O'Malley negotiates with a man at a bank, she meets FBI agent Dave Richman. Dave Richman is interested with her and Kate also finds him attractive, but Dave is a Christian while Kate is not. Kate has grown up trusting no one except the O'Malley family. She has seen too much violence and injustice and can't believe that there is a God if He lets such things happen. In the Bible, it says that God is merciful and just, so she thinks &quot;then why do I even have this job&quot;? Before Dave can really talk to her about it disaster strikes. Someone sends Kate black roses. Black roses which stand for death. A few days after, an airliner blows up, and somehow Kate is involved in it when the bomber calls up and says, \\"tell Kate O'Malley that I haven't forgotten the past.\\" But Kate O'Malley does not want to remember the past. She tries to shut it out but then she is faced with shocking and terrifying evidence that the bomber may be someone she know, someone from her past! Dave discovers that he is in love with Kate and vows to protect her but will she be able to trust in Dave and the God he trusts somuch in?<br />\\"The Negotiator\\" is very well-written. I just fell in love with the characters of Kate O'Malley and Dave Richman. It's also so suspenseful that I suggest you read it on a day when you have plenty of free time because you won't be able to put the book down! It was terrible when I had only the last few chapters to read when I had to go to school! What agony! But it's not only the suspense, action, mystery, and the excitement I had when reading it that I liked, I also loved the humor and romance in it. The humor in it very much reminds me of my sister and I when we talk to each other. This book also talks about trust and faith in not only our friends and family, but in God. God is always with us and though we don't know why He does this or why He doesn't do that, we must always have faith in Him and to pray.<br />The next in the O'Malley series is \\"The Guardian\\" in which the main character is Marcus O'Malley, the oldest of the O'Malley's. This is also another great book! Then after that there is \\"The Truth-Seeker\\" with Lisa O'Malley then \\"The Protector\\" with Jack O'Malley. Can't wait to read those, too! Other books by Dee Henderson is \\"Danger in the Shadows\\" (written before \\"The Negotiator\\" whose main character is Dave Richman's sister, Sara) and \\"True Devotion\\", the first in the Uncommon Heroes Series. Don't miss any of these books!	2001-11-01

They are left for dead and Nagru and his army keep looking for Serena and Truffen using two ermine, called the evil Dirgecallers to track down the squirrel queen and her son.<br />Meanwhile, Mariel and Dandin themselves are in serious trouble as they fight off a group of rats who are trying to kill a family of moles. Luckily, they are helped by hare Field Marshal Meldrum Fallowthorn with his four nephew leveret hares and run the rats off. The grateful moles lead them to their mole hideout and explains the circumstances of Southward. The next day they see Nagru, his army, and the Dirgecallers on the scent of Serena and Truffle. Wanting to help, they started jumping on the very top of a dune and the dune collapses on all of the rats and Nagru! Some of his rats are killed and the Dirgecallers, who were in the front, are also killed. Mariel, Dandin, and Meldrum are captured and made to starve in the highest tower in Castle Floret. The break down the door by breaking the hinges, then free the other prisoners whom one of them happens to be Gael Squirrelking! The other prisoner is Glokkpod, a great, red-backed shrike. They try to escape but there is no way out since they're at the top of the tower and the rats have discovered their escape and are rushing in. Glokkpod helps to break open the roof to the atticand they stay there, trying to keep off the rat hordes.<br />While all of this is going on, back at Redwall Abbey, Joseph the Bellmaker has a vision from the mouse warrior, Martin. In his vision he is told that Mariel is in danger and needs his help. He is told to go by sea towards the south and is told, \\"Five will ride the Roaringburn, But only four will e'er return.\\" Using the clues, they realize that the five mentioned is Joseph, Rufe Brush the squirrel bellringer, Durry Quill the cellar hog, Foremole, and Hon Rosie, the hare. Together with the help of Log-a-log and his shrews and Finbarr Galedeep the sea otter, they steal the ship, \\"The Pearl Queen\\" (which rightfully belongs to Finbarr) to sail away to help Mariel.<br />Will Mariel and her friends be able to escape Castle Floret? Will Serena and her friend otters try to help them? Will Joseph, the Redwall creatures, and their friends come to help fight Nagru and his army? Is it true that `five will ride the Roaringburn, but only four will e'er return? To find out these questions, however, you'll have to read the book yourself to find out.  <br />This book \\"The Bellmaker\\" is of the Redwall series and should be read right after reading \\"Mariel of Redwall. Probably my most favorite characters in this book is Dandin, Meldrum, Hon Rosie, and Rufe. Dandin for being the brave and kind warrior mouse, Meldrum because of his military ways, Hon Rosie for her jokes and her ear shattering laugh, and Rufe for his timid yet strong ways. Rufe was lucky to have such nice friends Durry and Fatch the sea rat.	2001-11-01

Tom Chantry came from the East to the West to buy cattle then bring them to the railroads at Dodge. But when he backs down from a shoot-out with a drunk named Dutch Akins, everyone takes him for a coward and a man who doesn't keep his word. Tom can't find anyone now to buy cattle from or even help move them to the railroads. Tom must learn that he is now in the untamed land of the west where there is no law but only a man's courage and his gun.<br />Then Tom shocks everyone with how much nerve he has. He makes a deal with French Williams, a well-known man who everyone accuses of stealing cattle though there is no proof. He is said to be able to swindle anyone out of a cow deal. Tom says to Williams that if French Williams will supply the men to help take the herd to the rails, Chantry will give him some shares of the profit. Then Tom makes the deal more interesting. He says that if he himself can't keep up with the outfit and doesn't make it to Dodge City, French Williams will get all of the profit. Williams agrees to it.<br />Now Tom must be sure to keep up with the herd. But everyone forgets that his father was the famous Borden Chantry and that Tom knows what he's doing. Though at first he is against having a gun, he buys himself a gun and a rifle. And not only does he know how to shoot, he knows how to fight. Local outlaws and gunmen mistake him for a victim but they were going to learn that he is no greenhorn and not a man to be trifled with.<br />This is a great book to read!! When I first read it, I had such a hard time putting it down when I had to do other things. I couldn't stop reading it. It's very exciting and suspenseful. The character of Tom Chantry is really likable and I was rooting him on throughout the whole book. But probably my most favorite character in the book was French Williams. He is cool, smart, fast with a gun, and a very honorable man. He might steal cattle from others and swindle people out of a cattle deal, he still is very nice and trustworthy. Then there's also the character of Mr. Sparrow. He's very mysterious yet nice and kind, and strangely very attached to Tom Chantry, even though they hardly know each other. But if I tell to much about him, I'll spoil the story.	2001-10-30

But they are attacked by the pirates of Gabool the Wild, a searat who is a terror on the seas, leader of all the searats.  Everyone on board are either killed or taken to Gabool's fortress Bladegirt on the isle of Terramort to be made as oarslaves. Joseph is kept alive to be made to tell what the symbols on the great bell mean, but he remains silent. Mariel though is thrown off the cliffs of Terramort for attacking Gabool and making a fool of him before his followers.<br />She is carried by the tide towards the coast near the swamp lands. She remembers nothing so she calls herself Storm Gullwhacker, Storm because she remembers the terrible storm she was in and Gullwhacker, because of a rope she found which is knotted and used as a weapon. She meets three hares from the Long Patrol, Colonel Clary Meadowcleary, Brigadier Thyme, and Honorable Rosemary (called Hon Rosie). They take her to an odd old squirrel named Pakatugg who will lead her to safety, to Redwall. Instead, Storm (Mariel)gets so frustrated with him that she leaves him. Fortunately, he meets up with Tarquin L. Woodsorrel, a hare from the Long Patrol who was sent by Lord Rawnblade to stay at Redwall (he is also very much in love with Hon Rosie!) He takes her to Redwall Abbey.<br />There Storm (Mariel) makes friends with two mice, Dandin and Saxtus. Mariel regains her memory though when Saxtus recites an old prophecy which includes her father and her. She is determined to go to Terramort to free her father and to kill Gabool. The only clues to the direction of Terramort is an old poem and she sets out with her friends Dandin, Tarquin, and Durry Quill, a friendly porcupine. But before they had left, in a dream, Dandin was visited by the legendary Martin the Warrior and when he woke up, Martin's sword was next to him. The group knows that thespirit of Martin is with them.<br />But they are not the only ones who are heading towards danger. One of Gabool's captains has deserted with his crew. Their plans, to take over Redwall...<br />This is a really fun book, exciting with plenty of action and suspense. My favorite characters in this book are probably all the hares, Dandin, and Durry Quill. I love the way the hares talk, in a very British way. For example, &quot;Y'don't suppose they've bally well gone to bed, wot?&quot; &quot;Hardly, old chap.&quot; And so on. <br />The next book to read after this is definitely &quot;The Bellmaker&quot;, with almost all the same main characters as this book. But I strongly suggest you read as many Redwall books as you can because they're ALL great!!	2001-10-28

Don't miss &quot;Mossflower&quot;!	&quot;Mossflower&quot; is the story of a wandering warrior mouse named Martin who comes to Mossflower woods.  There he finds out that the woodlanders there are being ruled under the tyrant Verdauga, the wild cat who has a fortress, Kotir. Martin is captured for trespassing and carrying a sword, which belonged to his father. Gingivere, Verdauga's son says to let Martin go but Tsarmina, his sister, orders him to be killed but Verdauga says to just throw him in the dungeons for a while because he saw that Martin is a real warrior. Tsarmina loses her temper and breaks Martin's sword in two. She then orders that the broken sword hilt be put around Martin's neck. Before Martin is taken away though, he vows that he will kill Tsarmina for breaking his sword.<br />Unfortunately for Martin, Tsarmina murders her father, putting the blame on Gingivere. She throws him into the dungeons then puts herself in her father's place, now to be the tyrant of Kotir and Mossflower. The woodlander animals flee to the safety of Bella the Brokhall, a female badgers, place. They then try to concoct a plan to stop Tsarmina from her reign of terror.<br />Winter passes, then spring arrives, with Martin still forgotten in the dungeons. He tries to talk to Gingivere but is always quieted by the soldiers. One day though, a mouse named Gonff, the Prince of Mousethieves, is put in the same cell as Martin for stealing food from Kotir. Fortunately, Gonff is also an escape artist and they flee from Kotir, Martin promising to return to rescue Gingivere someday.<br />Martin joins up with the woodlanders to stop Tsarmina. He makes friends with Lady Amber, queen of the squirrels, Skipper the leader of the otters, Dinny the mole, and more. Bella asks Martin, Gonff, and Dinny to venture to the mountains of Salamandastron to ask for help from her badger grandfather. With only an ancient poem to guide them, they set out to Salamandastron.<br />Meanwhile, two young hedgehogs who try to pretend to be warriors arecaught by Tsarmina's soldiers and are put in two cells on either side of Gingivere's cell. Gingivere manages to make tunnels from their cells to his cell so they can be together. The Mossflower animals get help from the Mask, the mysterious brother of Skipper, who is a master of disguises, to rescue the two hedgehogs and Gingivere.<br />Sorry, I can't tell you anything more because it'll spoil the story! You'll have to read to find out of Martin and his two friends are able to reach Salamandastron safely and if the woodland animals are able to save Gingivere and the two young hedgehogs.<br />The best of the Redwall series, &quot;Mossflower&quot; is lots of fun. In my opinion, Tsarmina is one of the best villains in all of Brian Jacques' books. I also love the characters of Martin, Gonff, Columbine (Gonff's sweetheart), Lady Amber, Skipper, and Mask. For those who haven't read any of the books, I suggest you read &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; first (if you want to read in time order), then &quot;Mossflower&quot;, though all of the books can stand by itself. ENJOY!!	2001-10-19
US	42636479	RSFAD023T4EDT	0553253069	306519798	The Empty Land: A Novel	Books	5	8	8	N	N	&quot;I'll clean up the town...&quot;	At first Matt Coburn is reluctant to do just that, to clean up the town of Confusion, Utah, a boom town over-run by the most dangerous men, every kind of gunman, drygulcher, outlaw, tin horn, and murderer. But he knows that no one else is up to the task, most of the town people believe that there must be another way to clean up the town without killings. Laurie Shannon is one of these people, a ranch owner, who is attracted to Matt yet doesn't want him to get involved. But there are others who knows that if the killers in the town aren't killed, more innocent people will be killed. Madge Healy is one of these people, who is being hunted down by Willard &amp; Kingsbury who want her claims and would even have a woman killed to have it. Matt must make up his mind whether to forget about the whole matter and just leave, or to make Confusion into a good town.<br />&quot;The Empty Land&quot; is a great book. Where as most of Louis L'Amour's books it was easy to guess which girl the main character was going to get, but I couldn't figure out if Matt was going to love Laurie or Madge. But you'll have to read the book yourself to find out. I also love the book how it explains like most of L'Amour's book that the main character is always at the same time doesn't want to kill anyone, he always knows when it is necessary to stop the bad guys.<br />For those people who want to start reading Louis L'Amour books, I suggest you read the Sackett series which I think are the best of Louis L'Amour, besides also &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot;, one of my favorites!	2001-10-18

For those who have read the other books in the Redwall Series, I'm sure you've all heard of 'Martin the Warrior'. Well, this book tells all about him, and where he came from before he had wandered into Mossflower to rescue the animals from under the tyranny of Tsarmina the Wildcat.<br />\\"Martin the Warrior\\" starts of with Martin, a warrior mouse, among with many other animals made to work as slaves to the cruel Badrang the Stoat. When Martin is able to escape with another mouse named Brome and Felldoh the squirrel. Martin ventures to Noonvale with Fellodoh, Brome and his sister, the mousemaid Rose, and Grumm the mole, to try to recruit the animals there to help free the other slaves in Badrang's fortress. But they are separated while Martin, Rose, and Grumm continue onto Noonvale, Felldoh and Brome meet up with some performers lead by Ballaw the hare. Felldoh and his band create havoc against Badrang while Badrang himself is trying to keep Coggs, another stoat, from taking over his fortress. <br />This is a good book but because I'm comparing this with the other Brian Jacquess Redwall books like \\"Mossflower\\" and \\"Redwall\\", I gave this book only 4 stars. The characters are really fun, my favorite being Grumm the mole with his curious mole accent. \\"Martin the Warrior\\" has actually a pretty sad ending compared to the other Redwall books.<br />Also, although \\"Martin the Warrior\\" is named as book 6 in the Redwall series, if you want to read the books in order of time, this is the first book, the next being \\"Mossflower.\\" So I suggest to those who haven't read any of the books to start with this one, but as I said, it has kind of a sad ending so have the next book, \\"Mossflower\\", on hand. Have fun reading!	2001-10-18
US	42636479	R2EV8LSUKRZQRZ	0743423011	728707079	Tomb Raider	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Terrific Book Based On The Terrific Movie &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;	Lara Croft, adventurer, wakes up on the night of the first stage of the alignment of all nine planets, to the ticking of a mysterious old clock hidden in a secret room. She finds out that the ancient relic is called the All Seeing Eye, which will lead to the whereabouts of two pieces of metal which, when put together, forms a triangle. When these pieces of metal are put together at exactly the right moment, the pocessor will have the ability to control time. But Lara's clock is stolen by Manfred Powell, a member of the Illuminati, a group who has a diabolical plan to use the power for themselves, steals the clock. Now its up to her to find the two pieces of the triangle before Powell does, with the help of gadget whiz Bryce and sort of boyfriend/enemy, Alex West.<br />As always, the movie and the novelizations are different which is the case of the movie and this book. But both are good in different ways. This book was great because though it didn't have as much action as it did in the movie, it had plenty of explanations to some parts you wouldn't understand watching &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, and there's also more conversation and humor. But the movie is better in that it has more action, though not so much conversation. <br />Enjoy! This book is lots of fun to read and can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. I'd also like to try to get the adult version of the book &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, written by Dave Stern.	2001-10-10

If you liked the movie, which I did, I'm sure you would like &quot;Pearl Harbor: The Movie and the Moment&quot;. Not only does it have plenty of color images, movie stills, sketches, storyboards, maps, blueprints, computer graphics, behind the scenes information, and more, it also tells about the actual history of what happened on December 7, 1941 at Pearl Harbor. I liked reading the actors, producers, and writers comments in the book. I especially liked reading about the Eagle Squadron. Teaches you Eagle Squadron slang in the book! <br />I think that even if you didn't like the movie that much, this book has plenty of information about the history of Pearl Harbor so I'm sure you would be satisfied with it. Enjoy!	2001-09-09
