Haunted was excellent follow up to the \\"Women of the Otherworld\\" series. <br /> <br />Eve Levine definitely deserves the title \\"Mother of Year\\" as she proves that even death cannot keep her away from the person she loved best in this world, her daughter, Savannah.  Eve goes to hell and back to protect her daughter and her guardians from a evil ghost who inhibits human bodies through trickery and creates havoc and death wherever she goes.   <br /> <br />This is a toughest assignment of her life/death but Eve certainly delivers and my admiration for her goes up tenfold and she has at last found her place in the \\"everafter\\". <br /> <br />Great job Ms. Armstrong!!!  Holding my breathe for the next in the series \\"Broken\\" due out next year.  Can't get enough of this series.	2005-06-18

And oh boy does Christina shake up Prince David's world as well as the entire palace with her smart mouth.  Christina is honest to fault but she just doesn't think before opening her mouth -- and what comes out sometimes will leave you in stitches.   <br /> <br />The royal family members are just downright outrageous from the oldest member (the King) to the youngest (Prince Nicky) and the staff, well they just simply don't know how to take Christina.   I very much enjoyed \\"Edmund\\" as sarcasm really does become him.  Christina she fits right in with the Royal family and doesn't take and crap from anyone including the king. <br /> <br />Although David and Christina's arrangement starts out as a \\"marriage of convenience\\" that changes pretty darn quick as theirs is a relationship which slowly turns into love which I think will last a lifetime.   Christina is exactly what David needs and David, as well as his family, are what Christina  needs.   <br /> <br />I loved this novel and could not contain my outright laughter throughout the reading of this delightful and refreshing novel.  Couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. <br /> <br />Thereby, I am anxiously awaiting the release of \\"The Royal Pain\\" due out later this year.  Great writing and great fun Ms. Davidson.	2005-06-18

Oh well - I'll just have to wait and see!!!! <br /> <br />\\"Dead as a Doornail\\" may not be for everyone but it was for me.  Ms. Harris left me wanting more as I believe things are going to be quite interesting in the next \\"Dead\\" edition, especially for the upcoming Summit.	2005-05-31

Apparently, Harry is even more powerful than he even suspected.      Harry has been assigned a mission by one of his most hated enemies which is to find \\"The Word of Kemmler\\" which he hasn't a clue what it is but if he doesn't find it, his best friend, Murphy will suffer the consequences but as Harry discovers later is that if he doesn't find this \\"The Word of Kemmler\\" the rest of the world will suffer more.  Therein lies the conflict Murphy or the entire world - the choice becomes quite simple after little contemplation of Harry's part.  Therefore, it seems we have a lot of bad guys on the path in search of \\"The Word of Kemmler\\" and with the prize being to rule all.    Although I miss not having Murphy play a major role in this exciting novel, I got the chance to know Harry's half-brother, Thomas, a lot better and from what I can see they are loyal to each other to a fault  (it's wonderful having family at your back).  Additionally Harry's relationship with his coroner buddy, \\"Butters\\", is definitely an interesting one as it seems Butters has developed a spine and Harry needs all the allies in his corner he can get and of course, \\"Bob\\" is always a bonus.    Lastly, I'm definitely curious about Harry's dog \\"Mouse\\".  There is definitely a lot more to \\"Mouse\\" than I suspected.      \\"Dead Beat\\" did for me the same as all the previous Jim Butcher novels I've read, I loved it and can't wait for the next installment, especially to see how Harry acclimates to his  new job.  Mr. Butcher you are truly one of finest authors out there and you always leave me with the ride of a lifetime.	2005-05-30

In this second outing, Aisling is once again delivering an item to a client in Budapest and while there will also be attending a conference for the \\"GODTAM\\", i.e.,  \\"Guardians, Oracles, Diviners, Theurgist and Mages\\" for the Otherworld or as they say \\"L'au-del\\", so that she can horn her skills as a Guardian by hopefully becoming an apprentice to a full-fledged Guardian as she was meant to be.    Upon Aisling's arrival to Budapest she runs into the one person she would most rather not  see, the man she left behind once before as she could not handle being a Demon's Mate, the \\"dragon\\" who sets her heart, mind and body on fire, Drake Vireo.  Little does Aisling know but Drake's presence in Budapest is not a coincidence, he's there to claim his mate, by any means necessary and not necessarily to Aisling's liking.    During Aisling's visit at the conference, other \\"Guardians\\" start turning up dead and once again the fingers of justice point to Aisling as the culprit and she must once again prove her innocence or be banded from what she is most determined to become and what she is meant to be, a true \\"Guardian\\" which she had denied herself by hiding what she is after the accidental death of her friend mentioned in \\"You Slay Me\\".  With almost no training Aisling makes a few wrong turns but she always finds her way back and with her underlying talents, which she has yet to realize, she is unquestionably going to be one hell of a \\"Guardian\\" (actually her skills are already beyond some) one day.    Although Drake understands what being a Guardian means to Aisling, he deems it as \\"foolish\\".  Drake feels he and his \\"Sept\\" should be uppermost in her mind and in her life and therein lies the conflict.   Compromise can be a difficult dish to serve but the wayI see it, if he doesn't compromise just a little, he will lose Aisling and that I cannot foresee happening as the big picture is Drake loves Aisling no matter what she does or where she goes, he's gonna be a part of her life, so he will have to find a way around this.  Can't wait to see how he resolves this.      Katie MacAlister has once again weaved an intriguing story of magic, lust, love and betrayal and I loved \\"Fire Me Up\\" as much as, if not more than, \\"You Slay Me\\" and I am impatiently  waiting for the release of \\"Blow Me Down\\" as I can't wait to see what happens next to my favorite couple, Aisling and Drake and of course, my favorite demon, Jim.     Ms. MacAlister keep this novels coming, as in my eyes you can do no wrong!!!!	2005-05-15

I have read every novel by Christine Feehan and have for the most part enjoyed them, not to say that I hated this novel, but \\"Dark Secret\\" showed me something that was apparently there all the time and I refused to see, \\"Lifemates are given no choice and they are generally taken against their will\\".   <br /> <br />While the Carpathian male proclaims that it is his duty to protect his Lifemate and see to her happiness/well being, who protects the Lifemate against such a predator?  What if she can protect herself and can make her own happiness? The reality of it is that he needs her more than she needs him. <br /> <br />Although I usually love the dominant Carpathian males in Ms. Feehan's novels, I had some serious issues with Rafael in \\"Dark Secret\\", in particular his raping Colby, and no matter how you cut it, it was rape.  Rafael is the first Carpathian I truly didn't like throughout the story and my opinion of him hasn't changed.  Although Colby has had to work hard to provide for her siblings and as difficult as it would have been, Colby would have managed without Rafael's entrance into her life. <br /> <br />When looking back on the series as a whole, Rafael wasn't the first Carpathian male to do what he did to an unsuspecting female who has given color/emotions back to a Carpathian male.   <br /> <br />I am fully aware these stories are completely fantasy and that the Carpathian male must find his Lifemate in order survive becoming the vampire but it's almost like saying \\"I'm going to live no matter what the consequences are to you and I will MAKE you go along with the program no matter what you think/feel/do, I KNOW what is best for you\\". <br /> <br />Although there may have been other instances, I can only recall  \\"Dark Symphony\\" where the Carpathian male, Byron actually gave Lifemate, Antonietta the choice as to whether she wanted to become a part of the Carpathian world.  Byron resisted his nature of taking the control away from Antonietta because he wantedher just as she was no matter the cost to himself.  Antonietta made that choice to be with him in all ways.  Although many of you did not care for Byron's character, I respected him, as he actually did what was good for his Lifemate and not what was necessary to his well-being.   <br /> <br />Unless there is instance where the Lifemate life were in jeopardy or death was imminent as in \\"Dark Gold\\" where Alexandria was bitten by a vampire and was destined to become a vampire, until Aidan intervened, conversion into the Carpathian world should still not be accomplished less she, the Lifemate consents. <br /> <br />After much consideration on my part, after having read \\"Dark Secret\\", I've decided to take a break from Ms. Feehan's Carpathian series as it appears I'm experiencing a problem with the fact that all Lifemates are portrayed as subservient to their male counterparts, no matter how smart or powerful she is in her own right.  As in every novel, it is the male who controls all.  <br /> <br />Maybe these novels are not what I need at this time as \\"Dark Secret\\" left a really bad taste in my mouth and I'm not certain I can rid myself of it anytime soon.	2005-02-19

I don't know how she keeps surpassing the previous novels she written but she does.  I hate when I finish her novels so quickly as the wait for the next one is excruciating. <br /> <br />I also loved getting a glimpse into Ash's other life and I can't wait to see what's next.

I really love Jude Deveraux and quite frankly I've read every novel she's written to date and will mostly likely continue to do so.    But after having enjoyed both \\"Forever\\", \\"Forever and Always\\", I found myself anxiously awaiting for the finale \\"Always\\" but now I find myself at a complete loss, completely confused and just a little angry at prolonging what should have been a great story.      I don't know what to say about \\"Always\\".  Okay, there are definitely some interesting points in this novel:  the time travel, the ghosts encountered along the way,  and of course  Darci learning more about some of the things she can accomplish with her \\"special talents\\".   After three novels you mean to tell me that this was it, this is what I've been waiting for?      In \\"Always\\" Darci has changed her life as well as her future completely.  Is this a good thing?  I don't think so.    Exactly what happened to Adam? No answers in this novel.    What about Darci and Adam's children, will they be born?     What about Darci's father, will he marry Adam's sister and have a child?     My conclusion as to how Darci eventually found Adam leads me to believe that all of the events that took place in the previous novels never occurred and none of the events leading up it will never exist so why write three novels when the end result is none of it ever happened.      Always sounds a lot like the Dallas episode when Pam dreamed that Bobby was dead!!!    Furthermore, what of all the characters Darci met along the way from book one to book three, will they just be her memories as none of the characters she encountered will ever have known her.      Sorry Ms. Deveraux, \\"Always\\" requires a rewrite.  Better luck next time!!!	2004-11-14

It's pretty obvious that some of you have not been paying attention, Anita has been headed in this direction since the past few novels and I personally cannot foresee her going back to the character she portrayed in the early novels because like it or not, this is who Anita Blake is now. <br /> <br />You either loved \\"Incubus Dreams\\" or you hated it. <br /> <br />I chose to love it, regardless of the lengthiness, the sex scenes, typos, or lack of scenes with major characters, Jean-Claude and Richard.  I thought the story was a good one, finally the triumverate is beginning to work between Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard but what's even better a new triumverate has formed between Anita, Nathaniel and Damian.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  I would not have missed \\"Incubus Dreams\\" for the world and am waiting anxiously for the next installation.  Anita is gaining more power, more knowledge and more skill and can still kick butt with the best of them.  Although at times Anita  seems a little conflicted about who or what she is, she is still number one in my book as she usually gets her man. <br /> <br />Just because some of you hated \\"Incubus Dreams\\", thought it was trash or not up to par ... well that's your opinion and if anyone writes a review stating that they liked this novel, you're on it like white on rice with the negative voting campaigns, once again your opinion. <br /> <br />Laurell K. Hamilton can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned and as long as she writes about Anita Blake, I'll read them and if her novels offend you, save your time and your money - just don't buy her novels but I know that I'll be right there on the release date of her next novel, probably first in line.	2004-10-16

Tessa may be a big girl but she has a heart of gold and is constantly trying to find to a way to make others happy.

Tessa hasn't felt that way in long, long time and has simply been letting life pass her by.  Tessa doesn't believe that Max would ever give her the time of day based on the fact that he is just one downright sexy and devastatingly handsome man.    <br /> <br />Max who has his own share of \\"baggage\\" is definitely a man who can see that Tessa is someone worth getting to know and once they start the two-step, he can't seem to get enough and doesn't want ever give her up, no matter what problems come up.  Although Tessa and Max have their share of ups and downs during their month long location shoot, especially concerning Max's daughter, Penny, their relationship endures and they both learn something of value from each other and boy, oh boy do those two sizzle right off the pages when they are together.   <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed this novel and will definitely be keeping my eye on Katie MacAlister.	2004-10-06

What Jane doesn't know is that there a madman, by the name of Aldo, who is out there killing and mutilating any woman with her particular facial features and now Jane is next on his list.  But why? Jane discovers that the woman she's been dreaming about really existed 2,000 years ago and her name was is \\"Cira\\" and she happens to look exactly like Jane.  Aldo feels he must kill Jane because of his hatred of \\"Cira\\" whom he believes destroyed his life by taking away his father's love.    <br /> <br />Jane grows weary of being surrounded by security; not being able to live her life as she chooses and decides with the help of Eve and Joe, along with conman, Mark Trevor who is more than he seems to set up a trap to draw out this madman and get him before he kills again.

But what kind of job can vampire find?  Well obviously a job that allows her to work nights.  Lo and behold Betsy finds her dream job, a job working in the exclusive shoe department of Macy's where she can get a large employee discount on the items she loves most.  She's definitely in heaven and although Sinclair, her Consort/King disapproves of her working and states \\"my queen does not work\\" and that she must quit her job, doesn't go over well with Betsy.  But Betsy being Betsy tells him \\"to get lost.\\" <br /> <br />As the story unravels, it seems someone is killing women vampires and Betsy is now at the top of the list but fortunately for her getting killed is no easy task as Betsy proves again and again that she is no mere vampire as she can survive, so far, all the things other vampires cannot, i.e., can say God, go the church, survive holy water and be staked and live.  <br /> <br />Yes, Betsy is shallow/vain, a bit self-centered and sometimes a pain in the rear end but she is also loyal/protective to her friends and I love her just the same.  Once again Betsy has proven herself to be a force to be reckoned with and she has also made some new friends along the way that will only add to this notable series.  Being Queen of the Vampires is not a role that Betsy cherishes but when put to task, she takes it in stride. <br /> <br />It's pretty obvious that Sinclair loves Betsy, with all her faults, and unfortunately Betsy does not want to admit it but she loves him too.  Therefore, I can't wait to read more \\"Undead\\" as I love those characters as they've made their marks on me.	2004-09-12

Well just ask Aisling Grey American courier who goes to France to deliver a priceless artifact only to discover the buyer has been murdered in a satanic ritual and a dragon \\"in human form\\" who turns out to be her mate steals said artifact and literally leaves her holding the bag. <br /> <br />The police suspect Aisling of murder.  As Aisling sets about on a mission to recover the stolen item and to clear her name, she discovers that she is indeed a \\"Guardian\\" but she has no idea what or who a \\"Guardian\\" is.  Due to her lack of knowledge/training Aisling  conjures up a demon by the name of Jim in order to help find the missing artifact so now she has an additional title \\"Demonlord\\" added to her list of accomplishments.  Jim is not your typical demon since he has no powers but he is definitely a hoot and when challenged comes through in pinch to save the day. <br />  <br />While trying to learn the secrets as to what a Guardian is/does, more murders occur and Aisling of course is the prime suspect to each one but who she can trust?  Her mate, Drake is definitely high on her list of candidates but her soul says differently.  Drake is a dragon who wears many hats but now that he has found a woman who can sustain his dragon's kiss he will not allow anything to stop him from claiming her as his own.  Since he's not making any real headway with Aisling while she's awake, he visits her in her dreams and wow what dreams they are. <br /> <br />I was just really getting into this novel when it ended and now find myself waiting for the next installation \\"Fire Me Up\\" due out next year to see what happens with the misadventures of Aisling and Drake as the two of them have me sizzling in anticipation.   <br /> <br />Katie MacAlister is definitely on a roll and \\"You Slay Me\\" is definitely a keeper.   Ms. MacAlister, you just keep writing them and I'll keep buying them.	2004-09-12

I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the following novels by Olivia <BR>Goldsmith:<br />The First Wives Club<BR>Flavor of the Month<BR>The Bestseller<BR>Fashionably Late<BR>Marrying Mom<BR>Switcheroo<BR>Young Wives<BR>Bad Boys (although a lot of you disliked it, I actually enjoyed it)<BR>Pen Pals<br />and have concluded, in my opinion, based on Ms. Goldsmith's untimely death, Dumping Bill was not Olivia Goldsmith's finished product. The plot may have been Olivia's but this story does not fit the in depth characterizations of her previous works.<br />Although I would not recommend passing on &quot;Dumping Billy&quot;, as I found it interesting that a lot of us still mistake good looks with stupidity, cockiness or something worse. There are times when you have to look under the surface of an individual or a situation to perhaps find something you might have otherwised missed, like a good person who assumes an undeserved title without actually knowing it exists. The lesson I learned here was &quot;you can't judge a good book by its cover&quot;.<br />Just beware this novel does not compare to the wonderful novels Olivia Goldsmith has defined throughout the years and you will come away asking the same question I did &quot;Who Really Wrote this Novel&quot;?	2004-06-06
US	49895626	RISOFR2O4SF5Q	0505525542	280223908	Sex and the Single Vampire	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Mmmm	Although I found myself anxiously awaiting the release of \\"Sex and the Single Vampire\\" after reading \\"A Girl's Guide to Vampires\\", at the same time I was a little annoyed because I loved Christian in the previous story and I wanted to him to end up with Joy his \\"Beloved\\".  <br />So of course when I began reading \\"Sex and the Single Vampire\\" I started to find fault with the writing, the storyline and even the characters.  But Ms. MacAlister convinced me I was wrong and \\"Sex and the Single Vampire\\" is a more than worthy follow-up novel.  I loved every minute of it.<br />This story revolves around Allegra who is a special woman who has survived some of the things in her life that most of us could not imagine going through.  Allegra happens to be a summoner of spirits who until she arrives in London hasn't managed to summon anything and her job is on the line unless she can produce some proof of her supposed abilities, that is until Allegra ends up going to a C. J. Dante a.k.a. \\"Christian\\" book signing arranged by no other than Christian's previously thought \\"Beloved\\" Joy and her sidekick Roxy. <br />Allegra actually meets the man who will eventually change her entire world.  Although Christian is everything she despises in a man (he is controlling and arrogant to top it off) but despite her distrust of Christian, she is drawn to him in a way she's never been drawn to another man.<br />Of course Christian doesn't believe Allegra is his \\"Beloved\\" since he's been wrong before and because she is everything a \\"Beloved\\" shouldn't be, Allegra is self-sufficient and completely independent but curiosity gets the best of him and time proves them both wrong because when the Christian and Allegra are finally united they become a very powerful duo and can face down whatever trouble comes their way.<br />I'm so glad that I did not allow my initial reaction to this novel get the best of me because I would have missed out on another wonderful story.  By the time I finished this novelI knew Christian and Allegra were truly destined to be together and now Ms. MacAlister has me once again \\"anxiously\\" awaiting her next release.  <br />Don't miss this opportunity to read a simply amazing story proving how the power of love and trust when tested can indeed conquer all.	2004-03-13

Well you certainly can't say anything negative about this novel because \\"Edge of Twilight\\" is certainly beyond compare.<br />\\"Edge of Twilight\\" is one of most entertaining novels Maggie Shayne has written to date and in my opinion it is simply the best of the \\"Twilight\\" series and I should know as I've read every last one of them.<br />This second installment of Amber Lily's life \\"the Child of Promise\\", the child born to two vampires who is born not a vampire but not a mortal either has it all, from drama to humor, from love to hate, from mistrust to trust.  Once you begin this adventure into the \\"Twilight\\" you will find can't stop reading until you've just reached the last page and still find yourself wanting more.<br />Amber Lily has supernatural powers like no other and she's still discovering new things that she can achieve.  To date she can't be killed by any known methods and that is something our old friend Frank Stiles former \\"DPI\\" secret government agent wants to obtain for himself.  Frank Stiles hates all vampires and attempts to destroy them by any means possible but he craves the one thing they have \\"immortality\\" and once again he's after the \\"Child of Promise\\" but what he doesn't know is that he is also being hunted by \\"Child of Promise\\" for the same reasons. <br />Amber Lily is on a mission to find a cure for a friend who has been diagnosed with cancer and along the way she meets the man of her dreams, I mean literally the man of her dreams.  Can she trust him?  No.  But Amber Lily follows her heart not her head and by doing so she ends up with the love of lifetime.  <br />And, although Edge has his own agenda (revenge), upon his first sighting of Amber Lily his quest changes along the way and becomes twofold, love/family or revenge/a lifetime of loneliness.  Which will he choose?  You might be surprised but read this novel as it is certainly bound to go down in history as one of the greatest vampire love stories of all time.	2004-03-07

Elizabeth Taylor is a woman with a good heart but vanity is still her name.  Although Elizabeth is still Elizabeth, she can do most of the things a vampire can do (although she's not exactly sure what those things are as she's just discovering them) but Elizabeth can also do things no other vampire in history can do, i.e. she doesn't need to feed on regular basis, she can go to church, wear a cross, be bathed in holy water and walk in sunlight, so of course the head vampire must have her in his in cult but Elizabeth has other plans. <br />Elizabeth plans to live (???) her life the same as before she died and has no plans for hanging out in the cemetery with the other vampire losers who have no sense of cleanliness. Godliness or style.   As Elizabeth learns more about her new existence with the help of a family member and some interesting friends she becomes a power to be reckoned with.<br />Undead and Unwed is indeed one of the best vampire novels I've read to date and if you don't believe me read it yourself and you could just die laughing. <br />Patiently waiting to read what's next for Queen Elizabeth and her new Consort as it's bound to be another terrific adventure into the land vampire politics.	2004-03-07

Couldn't wait to finish it but at the same time, I didn't want it to end.  Deadly Embrace is simply that good, actually it's one of the best that Jackie Collins has written to date and it is a definite keeper.<br />Good job Jackie!!!	2004-01-04

The characters, Joy, Raphael, Christian and Roxy jumped off the pages in living color into my world and my heart.  You truly care about what happens to each of them.  The characters in this novel demonstrate exactly how much they are willing to sacrifice for love.<br />The only problem I had with this novel, \\"was Joy really was Christian's \\"Beloved\\"\\"?  I say this because the feelings she initially had towards Raphael were the emotions evoked by Christian but since she saw Raphael first and not Christian those feelings were directed towards Raphael and she ended up with him and not the man she was destined to be with.   I know she had a choice and although I loved Joy and Raphael together, I still feel a deep sadness for Christian as he was amazing and a true gentlemen but I still sort of wished it was he who ended up with Joy regardless of her being damned as foretold my Miranda.  The characters in this novel demonstrate exactly how much they are willing to sacrifice for love.<br />Regardless of how the story ends, it was still a sensational  one that you don't want to miss out on.   I loved this novel and also the author who has done an excellent job with this particular work.  <br />In closing,  I guess we'll find  out more about Christian with the continuation \\"Sex and the Single Vampire\\".   If you haven't had the opportunity to read Katie MacAlister take a chance as this author is definitely going places.	2003-12-31

I picked up this novel many times at the bookstore and put it down when it was first released in hardcover but once I saw it in paperback I said why not?   Why not? Indeed.  <br />This novel was reviewed as being &quot;hilarious&quot; and based on the numerous 5 star reviews listed at this site praising the storyline and the authors, I figured I couldn't go wrong.  <br />All I can is &quot;you've got to be kidding&quot;.  Child abuse in Upper Class America is not funny and neither was anything else written about the spineless main character &quot;Nanny&quot; who happened to be the biggest wimp I've ever read about to date.  Her parents certainly wasted their money on her education as she came away with absolutely NOTHING and I mean NOTHING.   <br />I wouldn't even consider loaning this novel to someone to read, so after I finished it, I promptly threw it in the trashcan, which for me, is a major no no.  How the Nanny Diaries ever made &quot;bestseller&quot; boggles my mind, my head is still spinning.  <br />I wished I had put IT down when I had the chance.	2003-11-02

Her writing style is remarkable and she once again hits on life in the small town of Grace Valley and centers on the life of Dr. June Hudson whom we came to love in Deep in the Valley.<br />There is just so much to love about this novel but the one that I find interesting is that June's in love with a man no one in the \\"nosey\\" town of Grace even knows exist and she can't tell anyone, not even her father, as her lover happens to an undercover DEA agent.<br />If you're expecting a novel filled with violence and sex, this isn't the novel for you.  But if you're looking for a novel about caring and sharing, where people actually <care> about family, friends and neighbors -- usually whether you want them to or not, go pick up Just Over the Mountain.

I know writing this review will yield a lot of negative responses but I can't let my feelings go unheard.  I have previously read and enjoyed the Stephanie Plum mysteries (1 through 7) and in my opinion (which I never dreamed I'd say), \\"it's time for Stephanie to get a new job\\". <br />I waited an entire year to find out what would happen with Stephanie and Ranger/Stephanie and Morelli and what did I get -- disappointed.<br />You would figure after 8 outings Stephanie would at least have become more competent in her line of business but the character remains clueless. <br />Why does every novel have to explain how Stephanie met each person, i.e. Morelli, Ranger, Lula, etc.? Those entries take up a good 20 pages explaining what we already know. <br />Why keep rehashing events from the previous novel, i.e. the funeral home getting burned down, someone getting murdered on the fire escape. The moments were funny the first time around but it becomes a little stale repeating it over and over again.<br />Nothing new really happens in Hard Eight, it's the same old thing: Ranger/Morelli comes to the rescue, Stephanie loses another car, dead bodies end up in her apartment, Stephanie can't find the bullets to her gun, etc.<br />Hard Eight adds up to thing:  It's time to MOVE ON Janet, this series has run out of steam.	2002-07-21

The characters are just so easy to love and Angela captured my heart from page one. She's definitely more than just a pretty face. Angela has it all but discovers a little surprise left from her previous relationship which ended on a pretty sour note and through it all it Angela perseveres one-step at a time. Her first encounter with fellow attorney John Franco sizzles from the moment they meet again. Little does Angela know but John has had a thing for her since their high school days and nothing -- and I mean nothing is gonna stand in his way to get her.<BR>I believe you'll enjoy this novel as it's filled with romance and on top of several emotional upheavals along the way, Angela and John overcome it all. Having the characters back from the previous &quot;Mary&quot; and &quot;Annie&quot; stories is an additional pleasure. Anyway this is one novel deemed to knock your socks off cause once you pick it -- you won't be able to put it down. Enjoy!	2002-06-13

I'm not sure how a story about prison could be entertaining but for me it was.<br />The story begins with Jennifer Spencer, financial wizard, arrogant to a fault who goes to prison for a crime she doesn't commit.  Jennifer arrives in the prison thinking that she'd only be there a day or a week at most but soon realizes she's been set up by the person she's trusted and protected and who is going to leave her there without a second thought.  Prison teaches her a lesson that she will never forget.  Life is not just about material things but about thinking about something/someone other than yourself.  Although the story revolves around not only Jennifer Spencer, the main character, but a group of women in prison for crimes they've committed, some really bad and some not so bad and their courage and strength to survive behind the locked gates.  Some of the women's stories are simply heart wrenching but through it all, Jennifer comes out a better person who wants to make a difference for the lives of woman who have been mistreated in the system.   <br />I guess this novel was a reality check for me as it was something I never thought about.  I'm sure this novel was jazzed up a bit to show some happiness behind the bars but the truth of the matter is when your freedom is gone -- making it through each day is a challenge.  Good work Ms. Goldsmith -- you done good.	2002-06-11

The story of two married woman Elizabeth and Clover who want their husbands to be the men they were when they first got married (attentive, loving, sexy, high energy level).  Both women feel that after a few years of marriage, their husbands don't pay enough attention to them anymore, don't make love to them like they used to and they no longer do the things they used to do when then were first married.  The women decide visit a doctor who specializes in giving a person back what they once had (enhanced).<br />Well Elizabeth and Clover got what they wanted and more than either of them can handle.  The husbands are now listening to what they have to say, helping around the house, are very attentive to their wives every need and they want to make love all the time.  Seems like things have backfired, the wives can't keep up with their newly enhanced husbands and get left in the dust -- and since the wives can't keep up the husbands seek others who are willing to go the distance.  Now what to do?  Go back to the doctor and get the antidote -- well they find out the doctor really isn't a doctor but a con artist and that's when the fun begins.<br />This was just such a good read; I didn't want it to end.

I can't begin to express how much I enjoyed this story of true friendship in every sense of the word and it's one story that I won't forget for a long time.

I couldn't read fast enough to find out what was going to happen next.  Merry \\"Princess Meredith\\" has been hiding out in Los Angeles for the past three years because someone is trying to kill her and it appears to be someone close to home.  <br />While growing up Merry was considered the \\"ugly duckling\\" because she was too short, too human but mostly because she had no real power like the others at court.<br />Merry is employed by a detective agency as a P.I. - while working on a case someone ends up dead and Merry is being held as the prime suspect in the murder she didn't commit.  The media attention Merry receives after her release leads to her being discovered by the folks back home and she is forced to return to the land where she still fears for her life.  Merry learns upon her return that she may now inherit the throne from the very person she believes wants her dead and to her surprise and she is now coming into her powers which have been dormant all theses years -- making her a source to be contended with.<br />Merry is definitely the new star on my block hands down.  I found all the characters to be refreshing -- even the bad guys.  This novel is one you just can put down but it's definitely not for conservatives. <br />I don't know how Ms. Hamilton can improve upon this novel but I surely can't wait to read the next installation.  I loved it and I believe most of you will also.	2002-03-14

She finds out she has a connection to Morgan and is willing to do anything to save Morgan from the path she's chosen.  Can she save Morgan and will her love ever be reciprocated?<br />Sarafina - a gypsy vampire who's trying to keep her only remaining family member close to her and no one else.

I've gotten so much pleasure from reading her novels and this one is no exception.  Ms. Keyes makes you care about her characters to the point where you want to hug them or throttle them.

This novel was definitely an \\"Illusion\\". Although I can't wait to see what Ms. Starr comes up with next, Illusions is definitely not on my read again list. Better luck next time.	2002-01-16

Yeah there's a lot sex going on but so what, you've read worse. <br />This novel may not have been what you wanted but it certainly made its impact on you all given the number of reviews written in a month's time.  Anita still rules whether you like it or not.  You can hate the direction Laurell K.

Ashton Sinclair and Netherland Brooms' trip through the power of love was done with excellent taste and Ms. Jackson's descriptions left me breathless and wanting more.  <br />I've always appreciated a man or woman (in this case a man) who knows what he wants and doesn't let anything or anyone stop him from achieving his goal.  Ashton has wanted Nettie for over three years and decides he not going to wait any longer for her to realize that she is his destiny, the love of his life, his soulmate.  <br />Ashton places himself in a position where Nettie cannot ignore him or hide her feelings for him --- ignore him she cannot as Ashton is a man on mission.  The man is definitely a master at seduction without having to use the technique of force, he just applies love, simply plain love and sometimes it's not so simple. Ashton just wasn't going to give up no matter what.   <br />This story had me hooked from page one and if you're looking for a novel that renews your faith in the power/magic of love, Surrender is a must read.  I've followed Ms. Jackson's career from the beginning and am always awaiting her next release as she is one of those authors you can take to the bank.<br />Don't miss out on this wonderful novel -- if you haven't read Ms. Jackson's other works of art be sure to check them out as they are definitely worth your time and your money.	2001-08-05

There is just not much going on here to make this an interesting novel. Dr. Lynn Wyman became an instructor of  &quot;Womenspeak&quot; in order to teach men how to relate with women in their daily interactions because of the relationship between her parents which ended in divorce.  Lynn felt her father never listened to what her mother had to say and her goal in life was to help other men change their habits so that they could relate better with women.  Lynn has everything going for her, she a wonderful career; she has great husband who is an absolute marvel and he also cooks and cleans; she has a bestselling novel; she has her own radio show, she does TV appearances/has articles written about her in all the national magazines/newspapers and she has four great girlfriends.  What more could a woman what?<br />Lynn's almost perfect world spins out of control when she learns some truths:  the husband she thought was ideal turns out to be a husband who cheats, the news of her marital breakup is reported to the press (she thinks by her ex-husband), the career she has worked so hard to achieve takes a downward turn (because how can a woman propose to teach men to relate to women when she can't relate to her own husband); the friend she thought she could trust betrays her and the relationship between her parents was not exactly what she believed. <br />Lynn needs a comeback in her career which she is barely hanging on to and found this in the form of Brandon Brock a CEO who has major problems in his company because he can't seem to relate to women, the top women are leaving the company because of the hostile work environment he has created and the board of directors give Brandon an ultimate &quot;change your ways or change your job&quot;.  After a difficult six-month period, Lynn transforms Brandon into the almost perfect boss, one who listens to his women employees, who cares what they think and what their concerns are and then Lynn does the unthinkable, she falls in love with Brandon.  When I finally finished this novel, I felt had not really gained anything from it but you decide!	2001-06-01

In the normal scope of life first comes love, then marriage and then baby.  This novel does not fall into the normal scope. <br />Beautiful and eccentric rancher, Annie Hollister decided to leave the high paced life of advertising and return to the ranch her grandparents left her to enjoy a life she loves, fresh air, trees, grass, animals, etc.  After returning to the ranch Annie's biological clock is ticking loud and clear but she sees no man she'd want to have a child with so decides to go to a fertility facility and have a child on her own.  Annie has a beautiful baby girl, Madeline, by means of artificial insemination believing that the donor signed an agreement stating that he would not be a presence in her or her child's lives.   Things don't always work out like we want.<br />Handsome and determined attorney Jake Chastaine discovers he has fathered child (in fact Annie's child) because of an unscrupulous doctor who uses Jake' sperm which Jake and his wife had hoped to use one day but sadly that day never comes as his wife is killed before the deed can be performed. <br />Once Jake finds Annie Hollister and has gotten a look at Madeline who happens to be the spitting image of himself he decides he wants to be a part of this child's life is every sense of word and will do anything to attain that goal even if it means a court battle.  <br />Annie's afraid of losing Madeline and initially wants to leave town as she wants no part of Jake but she gets sick and guess who ends up taking care of Madeline, right, Jake and that's when things slowly begin to change to the normal scope.  Jake has a tough time dealing with a very active 14-month-old baby who gets into everything a toddler can get into but Jake eventually gets the hang of things.  When Annie is released from the hospital she realizes that it might not be so bad having Jake in Madeline's life.   The story continues in the normal scope:  first comes like, then love, and then marriage but getting there is no easy road for these two very different people but they do say that opposites attract.  This is a wonderful novel filled with much humor and love that will leave you feeling wonderful all over.    I enjoyed it Baby Oh Baby so very much and you will too.	2001-05-05

The twins are adamant about returning to their reunion so their worried father hires a bodyguard for each of them to protect them from a potential threat on their lives.  Each twin has a separate secret about prom night that perhaps had something to do with the women they've become.  The storyline was very slow and mostly uninteresting (it took me an entire week to finish this novel and that's including skipping over pages).  I will admit the last 30 pages were the only appealing points throughout the entire novel when it is discovered that Eve and Simone's lives may really be in jeopardy concluding that the threats are not because of their father's paranoia.  I loved Ms. Bevarly's My Man Pendleton, Her Man Friday and How to Trap a Tycoon but I have to admit &quot;He Could Be the One&quot; was a total disappointment and a waste of time and money.  Looking forward to the next release.	2001-04-27

I waited a long time for the paperback edition of the novel to reach the bookstore and Gar Anthony Haywood's Aaron Gunner series are definitely still at the top of my list.  I enjoyed this story of Aaron Gunner trying to solve the mystery of a rap star who  &quot;supposedly&quot; committed suicide.  Did rapper Digga Jones, an up and coming rap star, who had everything going for him, fame and fortune commit suicide or did one of his fellow rappers, his manager or his record label executives do the deed?  All these questions are answered and when you find out the truth, you may be surprised.  Check out this novel as Mr. Haywood is definitely the real deal.	2001-04-22

In the past Ms. Hailstock has generally written wonderful action-packed romance novels filled with lots of suspense/mystery but &quot;His 1-800 Wife&quot; is pure romance - - romance that will leave you breathless.  I completed this novel within a 12 hour span and it definitely left me wanting more.  This story of Catherine Carson installing an 800 number to find a husband &quot;in name only&quot; so that she can put a stop to her sister's and mother's matchmaking.  Catherine's goal was use the 800 number as a tool in order to find a man, marry, then divorce within six months, which would result in a reprieve from her mother and sister.  Unfortunately one of the callers to her 800 number is from Jarrod Greene, a man from her youth, to be exact her next door neighbor who made her life miserable as child (who at every turn plagued her young life with practical jokes and pranks which embarrassed her to no end) but Jarrod was also the brother/&quot;boy&quot; friend she never had, who had been living in England for the past five years and has just returned home.  Little did Jarrod know when he called 1-800 Wife that Catherine would be the voice he hears on the answering machine. As fate would have it Catherine and Jarrod marry with the understanding that after six months each would go their separate ways and all parties would free to do as they pleased and their families would leave them alone.  Unfortunately things do not always go according to plan, Catherine and Jarrod have had feelings for each other since they were children, the pranks and the jokes were just a cover and now with the two being married and thrown together in close quarters the love that for years had simmered below the surface has now exploded into a love which cannot be denied. The sparks are really flying now.  This is truly a fantastic reading experience so don't pass on it cause you will miss one of truly great ones.	2001-04-15

We met most of the characters in Fate but here we get know Vanessa's older sister, Monica as well as find out how Vanessa's marriage to Scott is coming along.  After the death of her husband Monica Jones swore off men and devoted her life to the rearing of her three children, her family and her job.  As much as Monica denies that she won't ever love again that theory goes out the window upon her first meeting of developer Devin Preston.  Monica cannot maintain her cool facade whenever she is in Devin's presence, the sparks just fly.  Devin knows what he wants and goes after Monica using whatever it takes to get her.   It's not an easy path but Devin is not one to give up and Monica learns that she can still love without dishonoring the memory of her late husband.  I really enjoyed Chances because it is exactly what this novel is about (giving love another chance).  Take a chance and read this wonderful story by Pamela Leigh Starr as it's one you're sure to enjoy.	2001-04-14

This novel was thoroughly captivating in every sense of the word, there was never a dull moment.  Someone is murdering newlyweds shortly after their vows are taken; the reason behind these vicious murders may seem ludicrous to the average person but to the killer it's pure genius.  Although the Police/FBI are on the case, four women of the newly formed &quot;murder club&quot; consisting of a homicide inspector, a DA, a medical examiner and a reporter for the local newspaper are the ones who actually trap a killer.  I loved these girls who formed a lasting bond of friendship because of this serial killer.  1st to Die had me guessing correctly who the killer was, then I started doubting myself and then found out I right along.  If you haven't read 1st to Die, go get it and enjoy the ride of your life.	2001-04-14

I've read all of Mr. Moore's novels and his work just keeps getting better.  I purchased &quot;Practical Demonkeeping&quot; on a whim by an author I hadn't ever read before and found I couldn't put it down.  I went out and picked up all of his other novels.  Mr. Moore's style of writing is unique and is in a class of its own. I love his guy!  Each of his novels will hold your attention from beginning to end. He is so very creative, imaginative and so very funny. Mr. Moore is definitely a keeper, so I'll be waiting &amp; watching for anything that he may publish. I may have been a little late finding out about this author but I'm definitely not sorry. For those of you who haven't read Mr. Moore's work, check it out cause you're missing something exciting and out of the ordinary.  Keep up the good work Mr. Moore!	2001-03-30

I just finished one of the best fantasy novels ever.  &quot;Thoroughly Kissed&quot; was simply awesome.  The story of the &quot;true&quot; Sleeping Beauty, Emma Lost who is alive and kicking in the modern world after a thousand year sleep.  Emma who has had to learn everything about the past and present history from the scratch has become a distinguished professor at a University has found out she has come into her magic a lot sooner than she expected and it is completely out of control and she needs help in reaching Portland in order to learn how to control the magic she now possesses.  Did I mention, Emma is a witch.  The new chairman of the history department, Michael Found is immediately smitten on his first sighting of the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, Ms. Lost but has his doubts about her teaching capabilities and wants her gone from the University but he soon realizes that magic does exist and finds that he is willing to do anything to help Emma Lost as he has already lost his heart to her.  Emma Lost and Michael Found are the definite made for each other but of course they have to go through all the hurdles before they realize they are truly meant for each other.  Emma makes the ultimate sacrifice and gets the man she desires.   The only bad thing which occurred after reading this wonderful novel was that I found out there was a previous novel &quot;Utterly Charming&quot; which I should have read before reading this one, which may or may not have given me more insight into the life of Emma and her teacher Aethelstan &quot;Alex&quot; Blackstone.  But you must know I ran out and purchased &quot;Utterly Charming&quot; before I finished &quot;Thoroughly Kissed&quot;.  Don't pass on this novel cause it's one of the best romance novels to hit the bookstores in recent times.  Believe me you will receive great pleasure from reading this fantastic story.	2001-03-29

This was an enjoyable novel from start to finish.  I loved it. A guilt ridden Alex Blackstone tries to make things right after casting a magic spell which puts his girlfriend, Emma to sleep for one thousand years after he kisses her and she falls into a deep coma which comes from a spell cast on her previously by her evil &quot;mother&quot; (mentor), Ealhswith.  Alex misinterprets the &quot;Fates&quot; (the rulers of the magic world) believing Emma is his soul mate but after meeting attorney, Nora Barr his views on who his true soul mate is slowly becomes clear.  After sleeping for one thousand years Emma awakes angry, confused and is truly lost in this modern new world.  Emma has to learn everything from scratch (she has no clue as to what a shower is, what a car is, etc.) as if she were a child even though she is the equivalent of a 20 something year old young woman.  If you believe in fairy tales, this novel is a must read, filled with lots of humor and the belief that dreams can really come true.	2001-03-29

Although the story was well written and the plot is taken right off the front pages of today's newspapers &quot;School shootings - children killing their peers and teachers&quot;.  I had a hard time with this novel, not because the story was slow paced (it wasn't) or uninteresting (it was) but because of the plot itself (the sadness and the pain).  I can't say that I enjoyed it as I actually didn't (it hurts too much).  The story did however open my eyes to some of the reasons behind these killings but I don't think we can ever actually understand the whys and we simply don't know how to stop the carnage. <br />I truly liked Officer Lorraine Conner, FBI man, Pierce Quincy, as well as the other characters involved.  Officer Lorraine Conner has a secret past which the entire town of suspects but their theories are completely off the mark.  I felt the pain of families and the outrage which comes from losing a child in such a senseless fashion.  Lisa Gardner is a very talented author and she impressed me to no end with &quot;The Perfect Husband&quot; but unfortunately &quot;Third Victim&quot; just didn't do anything for me aside from introducing victim &quot;Amanda Quincy&quot; in the next installation of &quot;The Next Accident&quot; which I am looking forward to.  In my opinion &quot;The Third Victim&quot; is one novel you can definitely pass on but judge for yourself.	2001-03-18

Wendy Corsi Staub did a fantastic job putting together a novel that you are virtually reeled in from page 1 and the pull just doesn't let up until you finish this exceptional thriller.   The small upscale town of Townsend Heights, NY becomes the killing ground for a serial killer of wives who don't work outside the home but who is the killer and why he is killing these women remains unanswered.  Suspicion is cast on almost every character mentioned in the book.  I kept saying &quot;it's him, no it's her, no it's him&quot; throughout the entire book.   When the true killer was uncovered I was at the point in the book where everybody knows whodunit.   &quot; The Last to Know&quot; is a must read.   I was on the edge of my seat until the very end.  Buy it or borrow it, just read it -- because believe me you will enjoy it.	2001-03-08

Nobody does it quite like Deborah Smith.  The lives of Ursula Powell and Quentin Riconni are so different and yet so similar.  Both were raised in poverty with loving families (one NY, the other in the Georgia mountains), both have been hurt by love and both have decided they would never allow another that power (love) to hurt them again.  The one thing that they each have in common and that brings them together is a sculpture of a bear which was created by Quentin's deceased father.   Once Ursula and Quentin meet, although there is major resistance on both sides they both discover that yes they can love and love they do.   All the characters are so genuine and refreshing you find yourself feeling as though you are a part of the story.

A Day Late and a Dollar Short was positively worth the wait. The lives of the Prices in so many ways seemed so real to me as it reflects so much of the day-to-day lives of my own family and friends. Just reading about this family on the brink of collapse but who manages to find its way back to what's really important, (family) after the death of one of the main characters is without a doubt a memorable one and one you don't want to miss. Acceptance of the good and the bad as well as the strong and the weak.

She's done an excellent job of matchmaking until she meets Neville Hawke a man who depicts everything she despises in a man and definitely not a man she would make a match with until she actually sees the real man, a man who is everything that she desires but is afraid to love.  But as we all know love cannot be dissuaded once it's felt and what have you got, an enjoyable romantic adventure.  Enjoy - I did!	2001-02-25

Elrod novels and finally took chance on Bloodlist.  I'm not surprised that I really enjoyed the story of Jack Fleming, a vampire with a conscience and on a mission to find out who killed him.  The story is filled with a refreshing mix of characters.  After Jack, I especially loved Charles Escott and Shoe Coldfield and I find the time period charming (the era of prohibition).  This novel was a pleasant change and I've already picked up volume 2, LifeBlood and hope that I will enjoy it as much as I hope to slowly work my way through the entire series.	2001-02-12
US	49895626	R2CEBLX2NM1PRR	052594558X	187046121	Bad Boy	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Good Guy Goes Bad	Jon Delano and Tracie Higgins have been best friends since their college days and have always made time for each other.  He's a hardworking guy who works in computer industry (nerd) who just wants to be noticed by women and of course, get laid and she's a newspaper reporter who aspires to be a good journalist but ends up with the puff features.  Tracie's one major fault is that she is attracted to &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (good looking guys with great bodies, who are selfish in all they do and have absolutely nothing going for them).  Jon comes to Tracie seeking help by way of transforming him into type of guy Tracie goes for and whom other women will also be fascinated with.  Tracie succeeds in her mission only too well by turning Jon into exactly the kind of man she's attracted to.  Unfortunately for Tracie she discovers she been in love with Jon along and tries to set him up for failure with the ultimate female fatale. Since Jon's now a &quot;Bad Boy&quot; he no longer has time for Tracie as he begins to conquer the fairer sex using all the techniques taught to him by his teacher, Tracie.  I've been a major fan of Olivia Goldsmith since the release of The First Wives Club and have read every novel she's had published but this novel had a rather slow start. If you can get beyond page 186 you may find an interesting story in there.  All the characters seem to be lacking self-esteem in a major way and looking for love in all the wrong places.  I'm sure it's possible, but I can't imagine looking for a man who knowingly mistreats women; who has no regard for anyone but himself and is just plain selfish; although there may be many women out there seeking just that.  I found it particularly amusing how a man would want to change himself from totally respectable guy into a &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, but one never knows, does one.	2001-02-12

I found this novel to be a huge disappointment.  Ivy Daniels, on her wedding day decides to not to marry, Keith, a guy she's been dating for years, as she realizes she doesn't love him and runs from the church in full wedding attire only to run into a complete stranger (Ben Stephens) she meets on the subway and then proceeds to go to baseball game with him just so she doesn't have to go home and face the music.  Ivy's friendship with Ben eventually blossoms into something special in a very short period of time. After forming a relationship with Ben, Ivy discovers she's already pregnant by Keith, the guy she was going to marry and now decides in the best interest of baby she should try and work it out with Keith by attempting to tie the knot once again. Give me a break!!  The biggest mistake one can make is to enter into a loveless marriage, even if a child is involved.  Sure a child should be raised by two parents but by two parents who are willing to go the distance. Fortunately Ivy realizes her error and once again backs out of marrying Keith. Although the story ends on right track, getting there was definitely a rollercoster ride.	2001-02-12
US	49895626	R3AM0RCUAMEXVK	0804119503	938459104	The Trouble with Mary	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Mary is Simply Adorable	Millie Criswell's is definitely an impressive writer.  The story of Mary Russo and her family is a riot from beginning to end.  Mary is 33 years of age and has a typical family who butts in on her life with comments like:  it's time you got married and have children, you're too fat, you're too thin, you think too much, you should do it like this, listen to your mama, we know what's best for you.  But Mary has a revelation after her boss commits suicide and has decided to do things her way for change.  She has finally come into her own independence.  Mary decides she's going to live her life the way she wants (but no matter what happens in life you're family is always gonna be there interfering whether you want them to or not) Mary moves out of parents home, purchases a restaurant and after confronting the newspaper food critic (Dan Gallagher) who gives her restaurant a bad review she realizes this is the man of her dreams, one who finds her appealing just as she is. I loved Mary and her meddling family, along with Dan's son who is a good kid with problems but changes after the influence of Mary and her wonderful family.  The novel is just plain funny.  As Mary's relationship grows with Dan, Mary finally comes into her own and finds a love she never believed possible. I'm sure you probably know someone who matches every character mentioned in the novel.  You will definitely find this novel to be entertaining and you will most certainly find yourself laughing out loud at the most inappropriate times, but never mind that, go out and get this novel because you'll love it.  Can't wait until the continuation &quot;What to Do About Annie&quot;.  Good Luck Ms. Criswell - - we want more!!!!	2001-01-31

Ms. Shayne's unique style of writing will keep you spellbound from start to finish.  I read this novel in one day which I hated doing but couldn't seem to stop myself.  Destiny, the story of two immoral high witches, Nidaba and Eannatum, was an interesting journey to the dark side. Imagine finding the one you loved and lost after four thousand years and once again it seems just like the first time (a love of a lifetime).  This was an extremely powerful love story filled with deceit and betrayal.   Although I enjoyed Destiny, it does not surpass its counterparts, Eternity and Infinity, but you will find it to be an entertaining reading experience.  I anxiously await the next installation &quot;Immorality &quot; due out in fall, as I remain a devoted Maggie Shayne fan.	2001-01-29

This was an enthralling, fast paced novel filled with powerful emotions which pits child against parent, wife against husband, and friend against friend. The fallout is just simply astounding.  I was so caught up in this story until I wasn't sure if what I was reading was fictional or factual.  The story goes back and forth between a 15-year who wants an abortion based on the fact that her fetus has no chance of survival and the confirmation hearings of Caroline Masters.  Although I wanted to know the outcome, I didn't want to finish this novel. Mr. Patterson is definitely one of the masters of courtroom drama.  Just knowing what some people who have power/authority are willing to do in order to achieve what they deem their &quot;success&quot; regardless of what the cost is to others is simply astounding.  Government officials who were elected to work for the people some times forget who they serve and a lot them end up serving the interests of special interest groups.  Kerry Kilcannon is still my hero and having Caroline Masters, Clayton Slade and Laura Costello as well as a few others from his previous novels, certainly doesn't hurt the storyline one bit.  This is one novel you don't want to miss out on.	2001-01-27

Mary Russo who at the age of 33 has finally come into her own independence, moved of her parents home, bought a restaurant and found a man who likes her for what she is.  This novel is just downright funny.  The Russo clad is a riot.  Can't wait for Ms. Criswell's next release.  If you don't want to find yourself laughing out loud in the most inappropriate places, this isn't the novel for you.  But if you're like me and don't care you'll love The Trouble with Mary.	2001-01-14

Private Passions is another addition to the Coles, Sterlings, Kirklands and Delgados saga and another masterpiece.  Ms. Alers' novels will leave you breathless.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Emily and Christopher from beginning to end and so will you. If you're a fan, run out and get it.

I love reading novels by Christiane Heggan.  Ms. Heggan is a very creative/wonderful writer and I've read nearly all of her novels which are each filled with a lot of mystery, suspense and intrigue.  Blind Faith was a good reading experience and one I don't think you'd want to miss.  There's a lot of action and suspense and you'll be guessing until the end whodunit. The characters are simply excellent.  Investigative reporter Kelly Robolo and Detective Nick McBride do set the pages ablaze as the plot untangles. The story is enjoyable and I think you'll catch the feeling of excitement as I did.  If you haven't read one of Ms. Heggan's novels, try one - you just might like it.	2001-01-12

Imagine being a wedding planner who is being blackmailed into becoming a bride because she tried to kidnap a man who was supposedly dumped by his fiance who hasn't paid the expenses for a wedding being billed as &quot;the wedding of the year&quot; and then actually falling in love with a man you never dreamed you want.

I love reading Mr. Woods' novels and have never been disappointed.  LA Dead was done in his usual elegant style.  Stone Barrington is one of my personal heroes in the Woods' series of novels.  LA Dead had me hooked from the beginning -- opening with a marriage and ending in the courtroom.  This novel kept me wondering who did it, although some of you will say you had it figured out from the beginning but for those of you like myself yes I guessed but I was never sure until the end.  Mr. Woods is definitely a master in this arena.  If you're looking for an enjoyable reading experience checkout LA Dead and all of Stuart Woods' other novels because they are worth it.	2000-12-16

The storyline was interesting from beginning to end but I found it lacked a lot of the action from Mr. Patterson's previous Alex Cross series. Finding out who the Mastermind really was came as quite a surprise but it really shouldn't have since the question was poised within the storyline. I believe you'll enjoy even though I found it lacking of its usual style.	2000-12-13

I own most of his novels and there are only a few which I didn't particularly care for.  Mr. Koontz' novels have been classified as being &quot;horror&quot; but I've never found them to be frightening. His novels are thought provoking and always make me feel as if &quot;it's possible&quot;. When I first started reading False Memory, it reminded me a lot of one of his previous novels &quot;Night Chills&quot; and I thought why am I reading this again. False Memory's beginning was slow and I had to push myself to get through it but somewhere around the half point it picked up to a level which held my attention.  It took me five days to complete this novel which is quite unusual for me.  I skipped over a lot of pages as they were too descriptive and unnecessary to the plot of the story.  While I must admit when I reached the end of the novel - I did enjoy its outcome but it was definitely not one of my favorites. False Memory didn't do much for me.  Mr. Koontz is a great storyteller who has written so many unforgettable novels that I have gotten great pleasure from and since I'm a major Dean Koontz' fan, I'll be purchasing his next novel and the next and the next.   He's definitely a man ahead of his time.	2000-12-10

The three main characters, Felicia, Gabrielle and Stephanie each carried an array of secrets.  I feel they each got what they deserved in the end especially the biggest deceiver of all.  I must admit that this novel touched me to the core.  I love to read, always have, always will but knowing that there are so many out there who can't just blows me away.  Illiteracy is a real problem in this country but a curable one. Who knows why so many people fall through the cracks and never get the reading skills required but these individuals should never be ashamed or think of themselves as being stupid - all they need to do ask for help, I know it's not easy but there are many programs available to assist non-readers and shame should never be a option.   As I stated previously I was touched deeply by this novel.	2000-11-27

Each story carries its own weight from start to finish and each left me with that special feeling that comes after reading a first-class novel. I honestly can't say which story I enjoyed more as they were all beautifully written.  There are definite highs and lows in each story but finding that special someone has never been smooth sailing.  As we all know, romance can certainly be found in a variety of places even when we're not looking for it.  &quot;Leo's&quot; was the perfect setting for each of these 4 masterpieces. My advice to those of you who enjoy reading high-quality material, is to go out and purchase this novel as there is no doubt in my mind that once you start reading &quot;Leo's&quot;, you won't be able to put it down until you've reached it's conclusion.  IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!	2000-11-25

I love the way Ms. DeBerry and Ms. Grant can weave a tale. This novel was all that I'd hoped for and more. The story of Della, Celeste, Ronnie and all those who encompassed their lives had me going through all the emotions: uncertainty, fear, joy, pain, sadness, happiness and last but not least a love that never dies.  This was such a powerful, moving and just plain wonderful novel.  I can't say enough good things about it because when I finished the last page I almost felt like I'd come home.  The bottom line is &quot;don't let the good stuff settle to the bottom&quot;. Although Ms. DeBerry and Ms. Grant's books are far in between they are definitely worth the wait.  Go get it and enjoy!!!!!	2000-11-22

Ms. Crusie has a flair for making me laugh. Since I take mass transit, it's not always a good idea to read of one Ms. Crusie's novels as the people sitting next to me sometimes tend to slide over or give me that look (is she crazy) after I've just burst out into fit of giggles.  Kate Svenson a woman on a mission to find Mr. Right and Jake Templeton a man who swore he would never be serious about another woman was captivating.  Kate and Jake's friendship grew into a fierce attraction.  It was amazing how the entire town guessed where both Kate and Jake's feelings lie but the two of them didn't catch on until they were too far gone to notice.  Kate and Jake's story was highly entertaining. Whenever I need a pick me up, I pick up Jennifer Crusie as she always comes through.	2000-11-12

I think my expectations were too great and I ended up disappointed.  This novel in my opinion was just not up to the usual standards of Mr. Dickey.  I loved Sister Sister, Friends &amp; Lovers, Milk in my Coffee, and Cheaters but Liars' Game just didn't do anything for me.  I've read my fellow reviewers comments but this was simply one novel I had wished I had gotten from the library.  I will continue to be a fan of Mr. Dickey.	2000-11-12

I have been reading Ms. Forster since I discovered her novel &quot;Sealed with a Kiss&quot; which remains one of my all time favorites. Secret Desire as I recall is the first novel in which Ms. Forster has done a sequel. The lives of both Kate Middleton a bookstore owner and Luke Hickson a police detective was an interesting one filled with a lot of initial unanswered questions which Ms. Forster concluded with all the answers coming to light. Kate and Luke met under very unusual circumstances but their attraction to each other allowed them both to overcome the devastation of marriages through the deaths of their spouses to once again find that special person. Each had obstacles to overcome in order to reach that ultimate achievement but in the end, Love, Trust and Honesty came through. I recommend this book highly as it offers much to its readers.

Ms. Carr's account of small town living and the going ons was pretty much accurate.  The town of Grace Valley reminded me so much of the small town where I grew up.  Everybody knew everybody and all your business was out there whether you wanted it out there or not. Although small towns are quaint, they still have their share of problems with crime but there's closeness in the community you just won't find in the big cities and Ms. Carr brought a lot of this out in her novel.  June Hudson and her community of family and friends made me miss that place where I can no longer live because I do enjoy my privacy but I miss not knowing who my neighbors are. This novel was pleasantly pleasing and left me wanting more.	2000-10-27

I simply admired Terra O'Shaughssey for finally standing up to her brother (a user) and hopefully the family (family of users) which made her feel she'd done the ultimate sin by not wanting more from life than working in a chicken factory (not there's anything wrong with than line of work, but it's not for everyone) but with the realization that education is the key to achieving success in the life. Michael Crawford although he came from a privileged family also learned a valuable lesson ... money does not guarantee happiness (he gave his wife everything but couldn't give her child and to her that was the ultimate failure) but because Michael had a supportive family he had a lot more going on for him than those without.   The bottom family is a very important part of lives but we can't allow them to make us feel guilty for becoming all that we can be and we can't hold them accountable for the choices we make in life that can bring us either up or down.  No matter what life throws in our paths, we can overcome those obstacles through time and effort.  Thanks for sharing this story Ms. Green, I for one enjoyed it immensely.	2000-10-24

Sharon Mitchell did a wonderful job with the family involved.  There just aren't words enough to express the effect this novel had on me.  The storyline was fast, highly entertaining and brought out a lot of emotions which I just didn't expect.  I loved the characters' strengths, weaknesses and most of I loved how this family stuck together through thick and thin.  Of course Toni Carleton was definitely the major player here but through the heartaches she faced and seeing how she rose above it all just made me want to stand up a cheer and cheer I did, not just for Toni, but for her entire family, especially, Lynn, Joy, Anna Mae and Chris.  This was one novel that touched me to the core.  Family is what's important in this life and it seems, we as people sometimes forget just how important, until...

Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake series is one of the best I've ever read. This novel did not include much about my leading men, Jean-Claude or Richard Zeeman but of the life surrounding Ted Forrester (Edward) who is a mystery unto himself. And I found the details of Edward's life fasinating. This novel was well written and had a lot of action, with a touch of humor and I  recommend it highly.  Although I hate waiting until 2001 for the next installment, I'm sure it will be worth the wait. Laurell Hamilton definitely has it going on and she has a fan in me for life.	2000-10-16

From start to finish I was there with them -- I laughed, I cried, I  felt their pain, their joy, their fear and their frustrations.   It's such  a heart-rendering story.  Ms. Jenkins is noted for weaving quite a bit of  real life history into her stories.  She caught my attention and I fell  hard for her novels when I read &quot;Vivid&quot;.   Since that time, I've  read each and every one of her novels (&quot;Vivid, Night Song, Topaz,  Indigo, Through the Storm, and The Taming of Jessi Rose&quot;).  My advice  to all of you, who want read a great novel, with a touch of historical  facts, Beverly Jenkins is one author you want to add to your to buy list  and one you'll want keep on that list.  Every time I say she can't possibly  improve on this last novel, she proves me wrong by doing the possible by  generating another great book.  Keep it up Beverly.	2000-09-09

Ms.  Jackson's characters are always interesting and her style of writing holds  your attention to the very last sentence. Brenda Jackson is one of the  queens in the writing industry, a star in the making. After reading one of  her novels you are guaranteed to want to read another and another until  you've read them all. I've been following her career from the beginning and  the quality of her work just keeps getting better. My favorite novel by Ms.  Jackson has always remained &quot;One Special Moment.&quot; &quot;One  Special Moment&quot; actually made me slowly exhale at its conclusion and  not many novels have had that effect on me.  Ms. Jackson is definitely one  of those authors you can take to the bank because you'll never walk away  saying why did I waste my money buying this novel. With Ms. Jackson's  novels you'll always be left wanting more -- take that from someone who  knows.	2000-09-05

I never figured out who the character mentioned in the  prologue was which kind of surprised me since I had already pointed the  finger at one of the other characters.  This novel took me by surprise as I  thought Ms. Files would have followed along paths as her previous two  novels, &quot;Scenes from a Sister&quot; and &quot;Getting to the Good  Part&quot; which both very good stories and I sometimes reread my favorite  parts over and over again.  Obviously, Ms. Files doesn't fall into just one  category, she's very versatile and not to be typecasted.  If you haven't  read Ms. Files' material yet, check them out -- you'll be in for a treat.	2000-09-05
US	49895626	R2M032UPYAM7PF	0451199480	988152936	One Last Dance	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A Sure Winner	I just finished the paperback edition of One Last Dance and wanted to let  you know how much I enjoyed it.  This was truly a remarkable book.  I  couldn't put it down but at the same time I didn't want to finish it.  I  loved the three sisters and how they rose to meet the challenges of life  and death.  I must admit Daphne and Kitty were my favorites.  It will  always amaze me at the things we are willing to do for love.  <br />I've been  a fan of yours since Garden of Lies but I must admit until One Last Dance,  my favorite has been Thorns of Truth.  I am awaiting the release of the  paperback edition of The Second Silence.	2000-08-26

Ms. Heller's books generally affect me that way.   She's a wonderful writer and keeps me waiting for more.   I've been hooked on Ms.  Heller since I read her book The Club a few years ago.  After reading The  Club I went out and purchased every book of hers that I could find.  For me  she became one of those authors who I would purchase on faith alone.  I  think you will enjoy this book so go out and get it.	2000-07-25
US	49895626	R3FY5PHBF7LKRY	0061030120	569759464	In the Midnight Rain	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Good Reading Experience	I read In the Midnight Rain and was quite impressed.  I'm not quite sure why I picked it up at the bookstore because I had never heard of the author but I'm always looking for new talent.   But the fact of the matter is, I  couldn't put the book down once I started reading it and I didn't want the  story to end.  Ms. Wind is truly a talented writer and I'm looking forward  to reading whatever she next releases. For those of you who haven't read  this novel do.	2000-07-13
US	49895626	RJJGEWLULFETT	0312205406	963436946	Hot Six	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Too Hoooot!	I got a late start reading the series (last year) but read them all within a week's time.  Ms. Evanovich just keeps getting better with each release.   I didn't think she could top High Five but she did.  I loved Hot Six and  wrote to her at janet@evanovich.com and let her know.  Don't ask me why but  I want Stephanie and Ranger together, not Stephanie and Morelli (even  though I like Morelli's character) but who knows whom she's going to end up  with.   I just wanted to mention there was one scene involving Stephanie  and a FTA which made me laugh until I cried (but of course I can't say  which scene).  I read the passage to my daughter and it had the same effect  on her.  I read this book in a day's time and now I'm sitting here  anticipating the next Evanovich release.  If you haven't read this book  you're definitely missing out on the excitement.   Those of you who didn't  like this book- - you gotta be kidding.  Ms. Evanovich keep those books  coming.  I love them.	2000-07-06

I read Practical Demonkeeping last month which was the first of Christopher's books I had ever purchased on a whim by an author I'd hadn't read before and found I couldn't put it down.  I went out  and picked up all of his other novels.  I love his writing!  Each of his  novels held my attention from start to finish.  He is so very creative,  imaginative and so very funny.  I had picked up Coyote Blue on a number of  occasions but put it back because I didn't think I'd like it (little did I  know).  He's definitely a keeper, so I'll be waiting &amp; watching for  anything that he may publish. I may have been a little late finding out  about this author but I'm definitely not sorry. For those of you who  haven't read his work, check it out cause you're missing something  exciting. Keep up the good work Christopher!	1999-04-22
