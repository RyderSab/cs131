US	43930707	RCH5ZGZ4C6WA7	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A decent read	I'd heard a lot of hype about this book, and saw it for $1 at a thrift store, so I decided I might as well check it out. I'm glad it wasn't more than a dollar, however. It's not that it was a terrible book, but it definitely wasn't the best book I've ever read. I don't really understand what all the hype was about. Alice Sebold is a very good writer, but some parts of the book were a little ridiculous. I understand that the narrator, Susie Salmon, is watching from heaven, and that Alice Sebold hasn't been to heaven, so she doesn't know exactly what it's like. So obviously, there is going to be some fantasy mixed in with the dramatic-ness of the story. However, there were just some things that I was like, \\"WHAT?\\" after I read them. I don't want to give anything away, but there is a part where Susie comes back to earth, just for a few hours, and lives in her friend's body as her friend hangs out in heaven for a few hours. It was just...weird. <br /> <br />Besides that part, and a few others, it was a pretty decent book. I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but if you're bored and happen to see it being sold for a dollar, go ahead and buy it. Or, borrow it from the library. Just to warn you, though, it is really depressing, and although all the critics talk about all the \\"hope\\" that there is in the novel, it really doesn't get positive until maybe the last chapter.	2005-07-18

If you're a teen looking for a book that you can relate to and enjoy without the predictable happily-ever-after ending, then Megan McCafferty's novel \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" is for you. It is honestly the most realistic book I've ever read. I loved reading about Jessica Darling because I felt as if I were reading my own journal. I also loved Jessica's wit and humor about life. Amidst all of the depression in her life, there was always something to laugh about as well--which is how life should be. <br /> <br />There are too many books out there that portray teen love in a way that isn't true-to-life (i.e. \\"The Notebook\\"). However, \\"Sloppy Firsts\\" is different than any book about teen love that you'll read. You won't be able to put it down as Jessica's life continues to change drastically, and once it's over, you won't be able to wait to read the sequel.	2005-07-18

It was a great mystery about murder, mischief, and adultery. Maddie Faraday finds out her husband is cheating on her, plus C.L, the guy she lost her virginity to in high school, shows up. The events that follow will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br />The only think I didn't like about this book was that it was a little unrealistic. (WARNING: Don't read the rest of this review if you don't want to know the ending!) Only two weeks after Maddie's husband gets killed, she says she loves C.L. and might want to marry him.	2004-09-18

In fact, I wish I'd read it a few months ago when I was going through a tough time with a guy. But the facts in this book have made me realize the mistakes I made and how I should feel about the mistakes he made. <br /> <br />This funny yet truthful book is blunt and to-the-point, no matter how much it hurts. It explains exactly how guys' and girls' minds work, and now I know that I haven't been judging teenage guys too harshly--they really are as perverted as I thought! Justin Lookadoo and Hayley DiMarco explain that any guy, even if he is a Christian, is going to be a guy first. There are also fun quizzes and doodles throughout the book. <br /> <br />I think this is a great book for any teenager. My outlook on so many things has changed now. One thing the authors suggested was, when you're with a guy, imagine that someone is taking pictures of what you're doing, and then showing them to your parents, pastor, grandma, etc. How would you feel about what you were doing? This made me realize that some things, even though they seem right, must be saved for marriage. <br /> <br />I also like that the book isn't one-sided and doesn't force opinions on people. It said things like \\"kissing, hugging, and holding hands while dating is okay. But if you believe that kissing is wrong, then don't do it.\\" It also said a lot of truths about girls--like the fact that girls like bad boys, but they'll just hurt them in the end, so nice guys should take on the adventuresome traits that bad boys have, but not the jerky traits. <br /> <br />I don't agree with \\"Spiderfriend\\" and \\"a reader\\" (who wrote a review on July 17, 2004), who don't like the idea of the authors portraying guys as pansies. The thing is, readers, most guys these days are wimps who expect the girls to do all the work. I think this book encourages guys to not be like that. Maybe the fact that guys should be the leaders in relationships is old-fashioned, butit is the way God intended relationships to be.	2004-08-29
US	43930707	R3ISA96JJ273Q4	1928749143	63874217	Millie's Grand Adventure, Book 6	Books	3	1	2	N	N	An okay addition to the series.	In this book, Millie Keith, a bright and caring 16-year-old living in the 1830s, has decided to follow in the footsteps of her Aunt Wealthy, who never married and travels to exotic places to tell people about God. Then the man she loves, Charles Landreth, shows up, but Millie doesn't want to compromise her Christianity for Charles. <br /> <br />I didn't like this book as much as the others because at the end of the book (and don't read any more of this, because this gives away the ending) Aunt Wealthy writes Millie and asks her to go to New Orleans and help her witness to people there with her talent of piano-playing. I thought that the next book would be about Millie's experiences in New Orleans, but instead, there is an epilogue that simply explains what's going on 6 years later. Charles comes back and asks again for Millie's hand in marriage, and Millie says something about daffodils (I think this implies a \\"yes\\"). So in the next book, Millie will be around 23 years old. I was hoping the series would continue to follow Millie's teen years. <br /> <br />Also, Millie isn't much like normal Christian teenagers. She rarely makes a mistake and has a kind of self-discipline I barely see in 17-year-olds. That might be because of the time period, but still, it's a little annoying.	2004-08-26
US	43930707	RD09IJLCWFFYO	0823406660	686726224	Slam Book	Books	3	1	4	N	N	I definitely want to slam this book...	Okay, it wasn't THAT bad. But this must've been one of Ann M. Martin's first books, because she didn't write it as well as her others. Also, it was a bit unrealistic. Anna starts a book where people write mean things about others, and suddenly, she's one of the most popular girls at her high school. One girl commits suicide and another almost does because of things written in the \\"slam book\\"--highly unrealistic. (At least it's mentioned in the book that these girls must've had emotional problems to want to kill themselves.)    Also, on this site, it says that this book is for grades 6 and up. Even though it's a short and easy-to-read book, I think it's much more appropriate for people in grades 9 & up. It covers topics like sex, divorce, depression, and, like I mentioned, suicide...plus other things that a 6th-grader probably wouldn't understand or want to read about.    If you're bored, this is an okay read that'll keep you occupied for a few hours. If you're looking for a really good Ann M. Martin book, this isn't for you.	2004-08-10

In this addition to the series, they go on a tour with Iron Cross, the most popular Christian band in the country. They encounter many problems on their tour, such as Laura's sudden drug usage. But of course, in the end, everything turns out alright...almost. At the end of the book, the girls are waiting to see if Laura's mom will let her continue to be in the band. <br />  <br /> She probably will, because even though the Chloe books are supposed to be easier to relate to than the Caitlin ones--which they are, in a sense--the Chloe books seem to be becoming more & more unrealistic. It's very rare that a band that has only been together for six months gets on the bestseller list. And it seems as if every time something goes wrong for the band, it works out for the better. <br />  <br /> I'm not trying to sound pessimistic or anything, but sometimes, that's not how it works in real life. Some problems are never solved. Yet it seems that, even though Laura did have her drug problem, and other obstacles popped up in the book, Chloe is usually happy. Most teens, even if they are Christians, are battling depression, but Chloe's band is apparently headed straight to the top, and everyone around her seems to be becoming Christians. <br />  <br /> I'm not saying I hate these books or anything. In fact, Melody Carlson is probably my favorite author right now. If you're looking for a fun read, definitely choose this book. It's just frustrating that everything in Chloe's life, no matter how un-perfect it is, seems to become almost perfect within the next few pages. <br />  <br /> I'm sure everyone who reads this is going to bash me in their review, because I know I'm sounding like I'm really against these books. I guess I should accept the fact that there's barely any books out there that are completely realistic. But don't get me wrong, I'm definitely going to read the next book in the series.	2004-08-06
US	43930707	R3FIQ7PM8RBISM	038549128X	12958692	Candles on Bay Street	Books	2	12	28	N	N	A huge disappointment.	When I first began reading &quot;Candles On Bay Street&quot;, I was hoping it would be a heart-warming romance story. I was hoping Dee Dee would come back, and she would end up with Sam in the end. Unfortunately, I was let down. <br />  <br /> As I read, it became more disappointing. Lydia, Sam's wife, didn't seem to care that Sam was still in love with Dee Dee, so no drama there. And no drama usually means no excitment. But, I kept reading. Then, around the middle of the book, I read that Dee Dee has cancer. WHAT?! Of course, there was no hope left for a romantic relationship between Sam and Dee Dee. Dee Dee would obviously die in the end. <br />  <br /> I didn't see a reason to continue reading, but I did. Each page was more and more corny, stupid, and ridiculously typical. There are so many dramatic stories about cancer out there, it's become a usual thing. If you're writing a dramatic story, hey, might as well throw in some cancer. <br />  <br /> The worst thing was, in the end, Dee Dee asks Sam (who is a veterinarian) to give her some pills to help her commit suicide. Who in their right mind would do that to their best friend? But, Sam does. He gives her some pills, and she dies. To me, the story was pointless and a waste of time. I'm glad I bought it at a garage sale for ten cents.	2004-08-03

My dad recommended that I read his copy of this book after I went through a very tough time during my junior year of high school. Brennan Manning writes in a way that you can totally relate to him. Even though he is a famous author and speaker, he is a normal human being. Even though he is a Christian, he makes mistakes. <br /> <br />In this wonderful book, Manning describes a ragamuffin--someone who knows that they've done wrong and knows that they can never be good enough for God, but accepts that they don't have to be perfect; God loves us anyway. Manning does a great job writing about God's love for us, and stresses His love throughout the book. <br /> <br />When I was done reading this book, I contemplated for about 15 minutes all that I had read, and I began crying. It's almost unbelievable to think that God loves all of us, no matter what we do, say, or think. He wants all of us to come to Him and accept His gift of grace. <br /> <br />This book is for anyone, even high-schoolers like me, that need reminding of God's love for us.	2004-07-29

I usually love Sweet Valley books, but this one didn't keep my attention. I only kept reading because I don't like leaving books unfinished.<br />This book is more of an introduction to the series than a real \\"first book\\". It shows why Elizabeth decides to go to London and it describes what happens when she gets there, up until the very end, when she finally finds a place to stay & work. The whole thing could've been a chapter or two. I thought the details were too drawn-out, and it was not a real page-turner. I'm hoping the other books in this series will be a lot better.	2004-06-20

But even after the first few pages, I thought that maybe it wasn't a good idea to get this book. But I kept reading, hoping that it might get better.<br />After reading the book, I gave it 2 stars because of 2 things.<br />1) THE GIRLS' MORALS. The girls swear in every other sentence, and Sally is the only one that is a virgin. But even she swears, and her number one goal in life is to have sex before she graduates from high school. These girls are only seventeen! I'm fourteen, and I vowed when I was thirteen to never have sex until marriage. It's a special thing that should be saved for your husband; not a toy to try out with every boy you see. And another thing: they drink. They're only seventeen, and they drink! The worst part? Their parents don't care, and some even encourage it!<br />2) THE UNREALISTICNESS. This book was completely unrealistic. Min's boyfriend, Tobias, has a puppy and treats it like a real child. He dresses him in clothes, feeds him people food, and even talks to him like a real kid. Sorry, but I think that's really stupid.I have a dog, and I don't treat it like I would a two-year-old. I treat it like a dog. Another thing that's unrealistic is the &quot;fairy godmother&quot; thing. There's no such things as fairy godmothers, and the only being that knows the future is God. Also, the book makes it seem like everyone is like these girls (swears all the time, has sex, drinks, etc.) when that's not true. Did you know that 50% of girls and 40% of guys leave high school without ever being on one date?<br />I hope that I help you in your descision not to read this book.	2001-11-15

In this one, Elizabeth really, really wants to go with Blue. But one day, Jessica asks Elizabeth to get her homework from her locker. Elizabeth goes to Jessica's locker, and finds Jessica's dorky locker partner there! When he asks Elizabeth to the dance, she is so nice, she can't bear to say no. Meanwhile, Blue is contemplating whether he should ask Elizabeth to the dance, and if so, when. Finally, Blue calls Elizabeth, but she concludes that she must tell the truth, and she tells Blue about her date. Blue is terribly sad, but then Elizabeth and Blue make up a plan that will fix everything...	2001-09-08

I've read 16 out of the 18 Replica books out, and I'm sad to say that this one isn't one of my favorites, but it is still very good. On the morning of her birthday, Amy Candler, who is a clone, wakes up to find out that she looks like she is in her twenties. Amy's mother, Nancy, and Dr. Hopkins, her mom's boyfriend, tell Amy that someone slipped a gene in Amy's body that would make her look like she was in her twenties on the day of her thirteenth birthday. Nancy, not wanting Amy's secret to slip out, tells her that she will not be able to attend the party. She makes up a lie to tell Amy's friends (that Amy's appendix was taken out) so that her friends won't ask many questions. But Eric is determined to find out the truth. Meanwhile, Amy is taken to a special hospital room while she is tested and poked with needles to see how they can get rid of the gene so she can get back to normal. Amy hates the hospital, so one night, she slips out into the darkness of night and goes to a homeless shelter for kids called Sanctuary. There, Amy volunteers to help at the shelter. You'll have to find out the rest by reading the book!<br />Now for my opinion on the book. I liked it, but some parts were extremely unrealistic. Like, how Amy's mother wasn't even mad that Amy ran away. Plus, who in their right mind would run away when mad scientists are looking for her? As I said before, this wasn't my favorite Replica book. My favorite is #4, Perfect Girls. Nevertheless, I urge you to read this book, especially if you're a Replica fan like me!	2001-09-08

Then Alex gets word from her Mom that she won't be able to come up from Texas for Mother's Day.

This is definitely the best book in the Todaysgirls.com series, and I have read 10 of the 12 that are out as of now. (August 2001) I also recommend that you start with book #1, because this is the first book I read in the series, and I was pretty clueless to who everyone is! Anyway, I loved this book! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! I *love* Alex because I am just like her. I even look like her! She is one of my fave girls. I also like Jamie, because I am shy like she is. Anyway, I *highly* recommend this book. And if you're a *big* fan of Todaysgirls.com, you've gotta be crazy not to read this one! You're missing out on a fantastic read!	2001-08-30

This is the first book in a 12-book series about 6 awesome girls of today that have a web site together. In this book, a girl named Amber invents the web site.

I've been reading the BSC books since 1st grade, and I'm devasated that they're over. I've been hoping that she'll begin a new series about them being in high school, but my hopes have died now, since it's been almost a year since she ended the series with this last book. This is probably the most sad book in the series, but also the best. If you love the BSC books, you'll love this one!	2001-08-09

As you've probably read from all the other reviews on this book, Amy meets a woman claiming to be her real mother and convinces Amy that she's not really a clone, and that Dr. Jaleski was lying to her. Amy runs away from her mother with the woman claiming to be her mother. It all seems to fit until you get to the end. This is a very suspenseful book. You won't be able to put it down!!!	2001-06-02

I have read (and have) books 1-10 of the Replica series (I recently ordered books 11 &amp; 12 on Amazon.com) and love them all, but my favorite one would have to be *Perfect Girls*. It was very suspenseful, compelling, and intriguing, and I recommend it to readers everywhere, especially mystery and fantasy lovers like me.	2001-05-18
