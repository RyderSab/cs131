Let me start off by saying that I love historical romances; however, I have never been interested in history ... until I read this book.  This is the first book that has ever inspired me to read up about history.  I was compelled to learn more about Privy Seal, Henry VIII, and Anne Boleyn,    I was that fascinated.   <br /> <br />I loved everything about this book.  It made me feel each and every one of Guenivere's feelings, from anger, to fear, to downright outrage, and then love.  Wow, what a ride.  I truly loved Guenivere's daughter, Pippa.  She was the most refreshing child I have ever read about.   <br /> <br />I could not give this book enought stars.	2005-09-28

You'll probably appreciate the secondary characters or the ancestors more if you read the books in sequence, but it's not necessary to follow the book completely.   <br /> <br />In saying that, I agree that Brenda did stray from her usual formula in the first three-quarters of the book, but I didn't feel that I knew Tyrell any less.  In fact, I think I was so ready to hear his side that I read it that much slower just to absorb his personality more.  And boy, did I think he was great.   <br />	2005-09-19

I truly hope this book marks a new beginning for all of JL's fans.  I was starting to get worried that we had lost her.   <br /> <br />Both Jeremy and Danny were fabulous.  I believe that one of the reasons that I love the Malory series so much is because JL has a way of bringing in all her characters without drowning out the two main characters.

And Kootz's writing style ... way, way too much description and detail on everyday things that were boring and redundant.  I did, however, enjoy it once I got into it (more than half way through it).  Even then, I had to skip the descriptions and details.

I rarely sway from romance, and I NEVER read thrillers (I'm a chicken....) I don't even watch them on TV, but boy am I glad I read this book.   <br /> <br />When I first read what this book was about, I almost didn't read it.  I don't like reading about battered women.  I usually have no sympathy for them (I was one for years).  I have always been a strong believer that if she's there it's because she wants to be there.  But this book really had nothing to do with battered women. It was about a women fighting back and taking back her life.	2005-04-13

I must agree with the other reviewers -- this book is good, however, it moves so slow.  Like another reviewer, the only reason I finished it was to see what happened with the ghost.  <br />Also, another problem I had was when Mereli lost her virginity. (If she did! Ms. Coffman doesn't really say yay or nay.) There was nothing to lead up to such an interlude.  Also, we didn't get to know Meleri's thoughts on losing her virginity.  <br />I will say though the book got better after the first 225 pages. But even though, I was yawning throughout the book.	2004-07-19

This book is so different from other books I have read.  Karyn Monk is such a good writer, she really helped me understand how sad it is to be ostracized for being different and how mean children can be. But on a lighter note, the constant bickering between the elders of the clan was very amusing. And McDunn's way with words is outstanding. The plot is very original.  <br />This is the first book from Karyn Monk I have read and it won't be my last.	2004-07-10

This book was no exception.  <br />Dee is a very, very strong character, yet she's feminine. Lucas is the alpha male that Linda Howard (and me) loves so much.  These two actually cause so many sparks I thought the pages in my book were going to catch fire!  <br />Anyhoot, I highly recommend this book (all Linda Howard books for that matter).	2004-07-02

There were so many subplots that had nothing to do with the book.  I mean there was page after page, after page of the prince and his mistress.  Not only was it unnecessary, it was BORING, and SICKENING.  They were so lovydovy it was gross.  I found myself (at times) reluctant to pick it back up. I couldn't even skip the pages and pages of the prince and his mistress because I kept telling myself that of course if had something to do with the plot.  WRONG!!     On the good side, it had a very good plot (the reason for 3 stars).  But come on even after Tony slept with Adam and talked to him all night, he still couldn't figure out who she was?  Okay, she had a mask painted on but don't you think her voice would give her away?  Again, this was a good book but very fantastical. Some of the things Tony did, i.e., the duel, the race, etc. were too unbelievable.  Isn't the whole reason for reading to be brought into the plot and not keep telling yourself \\"yeah, right.\\"	2004-07-02

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the mother committed an unspeakable act (I can't say what she did, it would give the book away) and when she finally confessed nothing more was said about it.  But this was not enough to hurt the book.  I just felt as if Brenda Joyce forgot about the mother.  Anyhow, this was a great book.  I highly recommend it.	2004-07-02

Even though this is the first book from Lorraine Heath I have read, I am an instant fan! <br />FYI: My 13-year-old daughter loves to read historical romance books but I have to read them first to determine whether or not she can read them (because of their sexual content), well I handed this book to her without ANY WORRY WHATSOEVER.

Maybe JL reviewed it and made some changes, but I doubt that she wrote it.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not \\"JL good.\\" If this was any other author I probably would have given it 5 stars, but I have read all JL's book and know what she is capable of writing.<br />A few of the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars is as follows:<br />1) The stable scene -- what happened?  I'm still not sure.  It was so abrupt.  Absolutely no sexual tension to lead up to such an interlude; 2) When Chad and Marian admitted they loved each other, I was actually in shock.  When did it happen?  I actually flipped back through the pages to see what I had missed; 3) Where's the dialogue?  We actually got to know them through their thoughts!!<br />The end was very, very good.  That's why I gave it 4 stars. Overall, I would recommend this book (in paperback). It was good.	2003-07-22

This book was one of the best books I have ever read. <br />When I first started reading this book I thought Kassia was going to be one of those \\"weak heroines.\\" I was wrong. Kassia is very strong, and stayed strong throughout the book without being stupid. You know what I mean: those women who disobey and put their husband in danger and thereafter are considered intelligent and free spirited (please). Well, Kassia is not one of those . . . free spirited women. She is intelligent and caring without being weak. <br />Graelam believes that a woman is only good for breeding and pleasing her husband. Well, how many books have we read with a hero like this? I agree. However, Graelam is somehow different. It takes him a long time to come around and during this time he does do cruel things to Kassia: sleeping with the servants and raping Kassia. Still, somehow you've got to feel sorry for a guy whose wife refuses to sleep with him. <br />You have to remember that it's a book and what other way for a book to be a page-turner other than to have every emotion imaginable? Emotion is what this book has plenty of. How boring a book when it's all roses.	2002-07-14

The only thing that I didn't like is that in both books the heroine realizes she loves him too soon. There's not enough \\"what's wrong with me? Why does he get to me so easy?\\" for it to be believable or even suspenseful. <br />Lorelei Dupree is engaged to her lifelong friend, Jason, with whom she grew up. She naturally believes she's in love with him. But when Black Jack Rhys abducts her, while posing as a barmaid to trap him, she starts to see her life through his eyes and becomes confused. <br />Black Jack Rhys is a notorious rake who can't understand why he is so attracted to this not-so-beautiful looking young woman when he can have any woman he wants. Nevertheless, when he gets to know her he realizes why. <br />I would say this is a good book and recommend it to Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason and Sandra Hill fans.

However, if you only like \\"sweet\\" books, this is not for you. [RR is know for being a bodice-riper]	2002-06-14

If I gave this book one star it's because the option of NEGATIVE STARS is not available.  This is the first Susan Johnson book I have read and if they are all like this one...it will be the last.  There is no romance, no love and no \\"HARD TO GET.\\"  This book was HORRIBLE!  Zena has no pride, no self esteem and no...NOTHING.  She is madly in love with a JERK who shows no feelings except for sexual desire. If it helps you, I am a HUGE Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason and Judith McNaught fan and this book is NOTHING like those authors.	2002-06-14
