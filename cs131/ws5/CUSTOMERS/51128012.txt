KILL ME TWICE, the first in Roxanne St. Claire's Bullet Catcher series is set in Miami Beach with the most incredible sexy, talented, and hot Cuban born bodyguard you will ever come to know, Alex Romero.  Alex is hired to protect Jessica Adams, a Miami newscaster who is about to write a very powerful expose which will put her at the top of her field and land her in New York.  Jessica asks her identical twin, Jazz, a PI, to fill in for her at the Miami TV station so that she can go undercover to get her story.  When Jazz arrives in Miami, she finds that Alex, a bodyguard has been hired to protect her twin, due to personal threats on her life.  Now her sister is missing and not to be found.  From there on, these two very capable, strong willed and fiery people team up and begin a journey and search for Jessica that will knock your socks off.<br /><br />I found this book suspenseful, powerful, intriguing and extremely sensual.  The Bullet Catcher organization is headed up by an amazing ex-CIA agent, Lucy Sharpe.  Lucy also has on her team, two additional strong and sexy men, Max Roper and Dan Gallagher.  The stores of these bodyguards and security specialists will be continued in future Bullet Catcher Series.<br /><br />KILL ME TWICE, I believe will be one of Roxanne St. Claire's best romance/suspense novel.  This book truly deserves five stars and more!  I can hardly wait until THRILL ME TO DEATH (Max Roper's story) will be released.	2005-09-29

Estella  is being sold off to the highest bidder in order to save the family reputation.  Estella is very warm, soft, sexy and sensitive.<br /><br />Ramon meets Estella at her family home where he has a meeting with her father to purchase a TV station.  However, there is a glitch when her father wants her married as part of the deal to save the family name from a past scandal.  Ramon wants the TV station, the only thing that would truly be his, not something belonging to his past or present family ties.<br /><br />Personally, I fell in love with Ramon's character;  He's strong, sexy, sensitive, intelligent, and daring, the perfect alpha male.  Kate has an incredible way of describing Ramon from his background, to his present role in the Alcolar family, business and his feelings and intentions where Estella is concerned.  Estella has been accused of being a \\"fallen woman\\" by high society.  She is warm, sensitive and a real spitfire.  When Ramon and Estella are put together, sparks begin to form and fly.  This very high paced love story continues with a marriage of convenience and both realize that this mutual attraction is something more.<br /><br />Once I began to read this wonderful love story, I couldn't put it down.  I also encourage you to read \\"The Twelve-Month Mistress\\", the first in the series. If you get to know the Alcolar's, you won't be sorry, I promise.	2005-05-02

When the beautiful Samantha sets out for a one week fling before committing herself to a marriage to save her father's debt, she by chance meets the handsome Mac in an Arizona desert bar.<br /><br />As their story enfolds, both characters not only learn about each other but also about themselves.  Mac taught Samantha the meaning of love, the fairy tale type of love.  Samantha taught Mac new things about himself as well, about his ability to love and give.  Even though they only tell each other half truths and live in a fantasy, their love and respect for each other grows.  Their journey is one you won't want to miss.	2005-04-17
