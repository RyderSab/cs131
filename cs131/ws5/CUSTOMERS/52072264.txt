Unfortunately, none of the other mine workers, nor their work, is more than mentioned in passing.  Very little description is given of the mines themselves nor their operation-for example it is unclear even how many shafts were in operation at any particular time.  In addition to labor history and the lives of the coal cutters, most of the remaining space is given to a description of the sociology of the company town.  The book has other annoying empty holes, such not even superficially mentioning the fate of the town after 1926.  But overall, A Way of Work... is well written and worthwhile.<br /><br />&#62; Click on https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AI0BCEWRE04G0/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.	2000-10-19

Bates is unfortunately, a little more than a directory or mailing list of such museums.  In the center of  the book are photos, generally of exhibits, of about 25 museums.  However, there is no information on hours, nor any descriptions of exhibits, etc.  Moreover, with a nominal publishing date of 1992, most of the addresses are  probably 15 years old at this time (mid-2000), and so, many, if not most  have probably changed.  Apparently, Volume 2 was never printed, which also  limits the utility of the book as a mailing list.	2000-06-24

The most evident purpose of the novel---as is appropriate to historical novels as opposed to  non-fiction--is to humanize McCarthy.  To see even enemies as human is  always important.<br /><br />Since this IS a novel, perhaps it was a mistake on my  part to have desired more concrete information on the actual facts.  Considering Mr. Buckley's politics, the account is remarkably  unbiased---almost to the point of blandness politically.<br /><br />As a novel, a  story of the life and struggles of a human being, it is very successful and  well done.	2000-03-13

Rather it was &#34;ordinary Germans&#34; (in Goldhagen's words) who were the perpetrators of the Holocaust, and bear the sole responsibility.  According to Mr. Goldhagen, speaking the German language and being anti-Semitic are strongly, perhaps unavoidably, linked characteristics---although unfortunately he fails to explain the underlying genetic mechanism.<br /><br />[According to Goldhagen then:] All Germans then suffer from a severe mental disorder.  Although we do not use the word &#34;evil&#34; in these modern times, it is unequivocally clear that, in layman's terms, all Germans are evil---although certainly not by choice.  It is not their fault.  It is merely a genetic trait, a mental defect.  People who share significant and noticeable genetic traits are called &#34;races&#34;.  So then, it is the German people, or the Aryan Race (using the terminology of the Nazi Party), who are the problem.  Mr. Goldhagen makes the point very clearly that anyone who could have participated in the Holocaust is subhuman, and no-one can argue against that.<br /><br />[It follows from Goldhagen's thesis that:] Surely, it is a great handicap to suffer from such a severe mental disorder.  It would be in the best interest of everyone, including the Germans themselves, to cure them of this dreadful mental disease.  Medical research may be of great help in finding a cure, perhaps requiring some drastic experimentation.  If a cure cannot be found, perhaps we should consider humane means to limit the procreation of Germans---for their own good, of course.  But, the bottom line, is that as distasteful as it may be, we need to be prepared to defend ourselves against Germans.  The most humane way to rid ourselves of Germans would be simply to segregate them somewhere else than where the rest of us live.  These need not be prisons, they can be humane work camps.  If a few suffer, that would be a shame, but surely more than a few deserve to suffer, so we should not be overly concerned.  Consider all of the suffering which Germans have caused us.  After all, Germans are subhuman.  We can be humane, but that does not mean we have to treat Germans as though they are also human beings.  They arn't.  We could, for example, humanely treat Germans the way we do stray cats and dogs.  That is, hold them in &#34;adoption centers&#34; for a while, then humanely dispose of them in gas chambers, and cremate the remains.<br /><br />Goldhagen declares that his thesis is wholly &#34;new to the scholarly literature&#34;. I don't know about you, but it seems to me that it is a rather old idea.  A very old and very evil idea.  Overall, HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONERS is the most instructive work about the nature of Nazism, Racism, and just plain evil that I have ever read.

Perhaps the 4 or 5 novels by Clancy-wanna-be authors I've read in the meantime have effected my perspective.  Simply  put, no-one comes close to Clancy in this narrow action genre.  RAINBOW SIX  may not be quite the equivalent of WITHOUT REMORSE or EXECUTIVE ORDERS, but  it is miles ahead of anything written by the copy-cats.  In RAINBOW SIX  Clancy added a new element, a  mysterious conspiracy.  The action sequences  alternate with the unveiling of the mystery.  Unfortunately, much of the  mystery plot is implausible.  Readers thus rush through the action and  character-development sequences, not fully appreciating them, to get to the  mystery sequences, which are ultimately unsatisfying.  As a result, readers  are disappointed with the entire experience.  The action sequences and  character development, are good by Clancy standards, terrific by comparison  with anything else in the genre.<br /><br />As to plausibility, as one of the  creators of the very first Earth Day, I do not find the fanatic  environmentalists in any way implausible.  I've known such people,  intimately.  The science too, is perfectly plausible.  It is other,  relatively irrelevant, plot elements which are implausible.	1999-09-07

New readers are likely to be disappointed, as character development in earlier novels is essential to appreciating the main characters.  Fans of the  series are likely to be moderately disappointed.  Very little new character development takes place, and oddly, there is little reference to earlier characters and events.  The introduction of a new character (a female) surgeon's assistant, presents much potential, which is not realized.  The  plot thesis also has much potential which never materializes.  As always,  O'Brian brilliantly describes the day-to-day life of sailors.  THE HUNDRED  DAYS is even richer in such details that the earlier novels in the series.  Unfortunately, in THE HUNDRED DAYS the ancient \\"HMS Surprise\\" journeys nowhere, and our beloved characters are too old and set in their  ways to be interesting.<br /><br />UPDATE: Having re-read the entire series a couple of times in the 15 years since writing the review above, my opinion has changed.  The novel is a nearly perfect fit in the series.  It is deep and rich, and rings true.  The novel reveals much about how the personalities of the main characters change as they age (as, in fact, they do through the entire series).<br /><br />However, I have chosen to leave my original review intact, because I still expect new readers (who have not read the preceding novels of the series, in order) to be disappointed, and for first-readers (who have read the series up to this point), especially young readers,  to be moderately disappointed by the death of Diana and by the departure from seagoing action and adventure.  This is not a novel to read on its own.  But as part of the series, it is a great novel, fully equal to any other in the series---which is very high praise.	1999-09-06

To read the whole thing in one afternoon requires skipping every other page, but fortunately, that in no way detracts from  the experience.  The Clancyesque details are annoyingly excessive, such as  the fact that an ordinary, totally insignificant, sheet of typing paper  measures 8 ½ by 11 inches.  Innumerable plot elements are highly  improbable.  I doubt that interior passageway walls within the QE2 are  concrete.  The descriptions of macho military types being seasick on the  QE2 in calm weather is completely unnecessary to the plot, and is  ludicrous.  Parachuting an individual soldier onto the QE2, while the ship  is making 25 knots, at night, in bad weather, in the middle of the North  Atlantic, against a hostile force is absurd---especially when there is  already a free agent on board, in radio contact with the authorities, who  is perfectly capable of the proposed mission (and in fact, ultimately  accomplishes the mission).  A submarine dawdling at periscope depth in 30'  waves in a hurricane without the slightest roll or pitching seems  improbable.  To be able to see a 100' rouge wave a couple of miles away  through a periscope in 30' waves is simply impossible.  And the list of  absurdities goes on and on and on.  With remarkable candor, a character  describes the action as reminiscent of a TV \\"movie of the  week\\".<br /><br />A flaw of most novels in this genre is a \\"cast of  thousands\\" which prevents the reader from identifying with ANY of the  characters-ATTACK ON THE QUEEN being an excellent example.  Someone  probably brought this to Mr. Henrick's attention, with the unfortunate  result that much space is devoted to adding depth to a half-dozen  characters.  The attempt inevitably (and unavoidably) fails, but Mr.  Henrick's attempt is particularly inept.  The \\"details\\" are  generic and potentially interchangeable among the characters, and thus, in  no way helps to define them.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, one of the leading  characters (in his 20s) is a \\"grizzled veteran\\" (Mr. Henrick's  own actual words) of the Grenada Invasion.  In fact, quite a few characters  are described as \\"grizzled veterans.\\"  Mr. Henrick clearly  overused his thesaurus hunting for hackneyed adjectives.  The advice of a  minimally competent editor could have, and should have, corrected these  flaws.  With more judicious character development, greater attention to  descriptive passages (LESS adjectives), and abridgement to about 1/3 of its  length, ATTACK ON THE QUEEN could be a notable novel in the genre.  There  is no sex, little gore, no controversial opinions are expressed, and even  the profanity is restrained.

The detailed and accurately  depicted diamond mining methods described will be unfamiliar and  informative to most readers.  In my opinion, the plot is a bit more complex than it  could be, and characters could be filled-in a little more, and more  numerous and more detailed descriptive passages would have been appreciated.

US	52072264	R185VLQBTHSXYS	0425136191	422763605	Blindsight	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A good one-time read	I think of Robin Cook novels as being \\"paperback novels\\" in that they are one-time reads (i.e., it's foolish to buy a hardback), because although great page turners, there is little depth once you're in on the  \\"horrible secret conspiracy\\" (whatever it is).  Also, like most  \\"who dunits\\", in retrospect, the plots are usually unsatisfying  because an inadequate foundation for them is lain early in the novel.  (Caveat, the lack of foundation is almost essential to creating the  suspense of such novels).  Given these generalizations, Robin Cook is a  master of the genre, and nearly all of his books can't be put down once  you've got a good start.  BLINDSIGHT is a departure from this structure, in  that any intelligent reader is essentially in on the \\"horrible secret  conspiracy\\" from the start.  So, BLINDSIGHT isn't as suspenseful as  most other Robin Cook novels.  I found the plot complication of a competing  crime family to only be confusing.  Similarly, the \\"bad doctor\\"  who apparently knows about the \\"horrible secret conspiracy\\" but  simply keeps silent is very unconvincing. I'm still unclear on who the  \\"really bad doctor\\" who gave the hoodlums the necessary medical  traning was.  And it is unsatisfying that neither \\"bad doctor\\" was  punished.	1999-08-05

Much of the action of the novel is set in a gold mine.  The extensive descriptions  of the mine, mining methods, and processing methods are clear and  accurate-with one possible exception.  Mr. Smith's use of the term  \\"heavy media separation\\" seems to conflict with standard usage.

Unfortunately the little book is written the first person which is awkward  and annoying-especially in this particular case.

They are clearly-to be polite-uncritical readers.  2) The readers who hated  it.  If you carefully read between the lines, you'll discover that they are  mostly dreary, bigoted, anal-retentive liberals.  Many closely identify  with the Phelan children.  They've been fanatical Grisham devotees because  of the hackneyed and relentless political correctness of his earlier  novels-and now they feel betrayed.  The &quot;objectionable&quot; themes in  THE TESTAMENT are the depiction of an extraordinarily kind, gentle,  selfless missionary, and of the redemption of a hopeless alcoholic lawyer  (Nate) by his faith in her faith.  3) The third camp is composed of readers  who appreciate Grisham's brilliant writing, but were disappointed by  various deficiencies which should have been caught and corrected by the  (apparently comatose) editor.  Moreover, while THE TESTAMENT isn't as  entertaining as THE RAINMAKER or THE RUNAWAY JURY, a comparison is  unfair-THE TESTAMENT is a different genre.  Also, admittedly, the ending is  unsatisfying, but that's almost become a Grisham trademark.<br />So, if you  are a narrow-minded zealot who expects a Grisham novel to be an insipid  politically-correct sermon, you'll hate THE TESTAMENT.

Similarly, throughout the book, events outside of  Alabama and Mississippi are discussed in context with their effect on the  Alabama/Mississippi oil industry.  Many maps, diagrams, and tables are very  effective in enhancing the presentation.  Even so, the subject matter and  the detail in which it is treated makes this admirable work primarily a  reference for specialists, and not a light read for a general audience.  A  glossary could have helped make this work a more accessible to a slightly  wider audience.  The limitation of the scope to \\"up to 1945\\",  greatly reduces the potential utility and interest in this work.  It simply  leaves readers hanging.  Surely one or two chapters could have brought the  book up to, say 1995.  Even a short \\"summary to the Present\\" of 3  or 4 pages would have been appreciated.  Apparently, even the author felt  this has he provides summary sentences describing the ultimate number of  wells and production of fields in Mississippi subsequent to 1945 and  mentions post-1945 discoveries in passing.  The book concentrates on  Mississippi, but covers Alabama nearly as thoroughly.  There are only two  petroleum fields in Florida, so the challenge to cover Florida just as  thoroughly is trivial, but this challenge is not met. This neglect is also  evidenced by several trivial, but annoying errors, in the discussion about  Florida.  Only 2 or 3 pages based on 2 or 3 readily available (free) Florida Geological Survey publications, could have made the Florida  coverage comparable to Alabama/Mississippi.	1999-04-18

It consist of childhood memories of the author between 1920 and 1927 at Kennecott, Alaska, a company-owned mining town.  Note that the town is now called Kennicott, but Mrs. Kluh uses the spelling  current when she was a child there.  The book provides a charming, often  hilarious, sketch of life in such a town.  It is sentimental without being  maudlin.  Obviously, childhood memories are selective and incomplete, on  the other hand children are often keen observers.  The book is heavily  illustrated, but the vast majority are parental snapshots of Sissy and her  sisters.  While I could have wished for more, that would have been an  entirely different book.

When I was a kid, my dad told me that there was a small outcrop of lowgrade coal in the back yard of the family home which they mined for heating coal, perhaps two or three wheelbarrows of coal a year.  Was it a mine?  Certainly.  The definition of &#34;mine&#34; does not have a lower limit on the size of the deposit nor the quantity of it which is mined.  Some gem mines have produced only a few ounces of gems.  Nor does the definition of &#34;mine&#34; require commercial operations or economic success.  The definition of &#34;mine&#34; does not require a permanent settlement.  Native Americans mounted periodic expeditions, traveling hundreds of miles to visit choice flint, pipestone, salt, asphalt, and other mineral resources, and often left no archaeological traces.  Nor is it relevant whether or not metal ores are successfully smelted or not.  Elsewhere Native Americans mined copper, mercury, and iron minerals as pigments and did NOT attempt to smelt the metals.  A mine is natural mineral deposit, from which someone removes a quantity of a desirable material for some economic purpose.  That's all.<br /><br />In this case, given that there unquestionable was a significant copper deposit, and that it was probably known to the Dutch, it would virtually be impossible to disprove the thesis that they mined some ore from the deposit.  It almost goes without saying that Kraft fails to meet this standard.<br /><br />Mr. Kraft explores four major sub-theses<br /><br />1) There is no unassailable positive evidence that the mining took place.<br /><br />2) About half of the book is concerned with the Lenape Indians of the area, and is totally irrelevant to the main thesis.  Apparently this material was meant to support the thesis (rephrased) that: &#34;No damned idiot would be wandering around in the wilderness 100 miles from the nearest settlement to discover such a mine in the first place.&#34;<br /><br />3) The mining technology of the period available to the local Dutch settlers was inadequate.<br /><br />4) The smelting technology of the period available to the local Dutch settlers was inadequate or too difficult.<br /><br />CRITIQUE<br />Thesis 1) Mr. Kraft succeeds in showing that positive evidence (documentary or archaeological) appears to be lacking.  As a mining historian, I can tell you that many small mines, say of the early 1900s, are no better documented.  It is particularly annoying that one of Mr. Kraft's key points is archaeological evidence based on digs he supervised--yet he never presents ANY results of those digs.  Whatever the results, a lack of positive evidence does NOT constitute negative evidence.<br /><br />Thesis 2) Mr. Kraft was apparently unaware of the fact that the French Voyaguers were all over the interior of North America by that time, thousands of miles from the nearest settlement, and in fact, by 1650, had taught Fox Indians (in the vicinity of Dubuque, Iowa) to smelt lead, to supply the French trappers with lead for their bullets.<br /><br />Thesis 3) Mr. Kraft presents a brief history of mining technology-which would be unintelligible to anyone not knowledgeable on the subject--and is utterly irrelevant to the thesis of whether or not mining took place at Pahaquarry or not.  Mining technology is hardly the issue--Native Americans which met Columbus in the Caribbean were wearing copper ornaments made from copper mined in the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan with deer antler picks.  Beginning about 1000BC to 1200AD the Native Americans mined thousands of tons of Keweenaw copper from over 1000 documented mines which was traded throughout North America. Surely a Dutchman with a simple iron hammer and chisel could have mined several tons of ore at Pahaquarry.  There are numerous historic colonial mines all over New England---most of which were tiny--often just &#34;holes&#34; a few feet deep. Colonial needs for metals were small, and the cost of imported metals was enormous. So, it was economical to mine and smelt very small deposits, even of low-grade ore, for the few pounds of metal needed.<br /><br />IF Mr. Kraft's thesis had been that mining technology available to the local Dutch colonists WAS adequate, that would have been demonstrable.<br /><br />Thesis 4) Mr. Kraft provides a nice summary of the prehistoric development of copper smelting, but not up to 1650.  He fails to describe what technology was available to the Dutch settlers, and so does not even address whether or not they could have smelted the ore.  Besides, lack of smelting capacity does not disprove attempts at mining.<br /><br />IF Mr. Kraft's thesis had been that smelting technology  available to the local Dutch colonists WAS adequate, that probably would have been demonstrable.<br /><br />Mr. Kraft discusses subsequent mining at the site, but far less adequately than magazine articles I've seen. Why not?  The subsequent mining (although ultimately an economic failure) is unequivocal proof that there was a substantial copper deposit at the site<br /><br />In short, Mr. Kraft flatly fails to adequately support ANY of his sub-theses.<br /><br />OTHER POINTS<br />&#62; The tradition that &#34;The Old Mine Road&#34; was specifically built by the Dutch for access to the mine is open to question---and could probably be successfully reputed.  Building such a road in the wilderness would have been a enormous expense for the small Dutch community.  Some documentation for the building of the road should have survived.  More likely, the Old Mine Road was a preexisting Indian trail, which the Dutch named the &#34;mine road&#34;, when a copper deposit was coincidentally found near its southern end.  If the Indian road had terminated near a large lake, it would probably have been called &#34;The Old Lake Road&#34;---the name &#34;Mine Road&#34; does not necessarily imply that the road was built access to a mine.  Even though the Old Mine Road was probably NOT built for access to the mine, for almost two centuries later, it remained the major highway in the region and was expanded and improved in the course of ordinary use.  By, say 1850, it was indeed an &#34;Old Road&#34;.

I suppose that, like myself, Mr. Bond judged making Germans or Russians the bad guys is too hackneyed, and making the French alone a  threat would be unbelievable.  Cauldron is reminiscent of early Clancy, and for good reason-Larry Bond was a consultant on Red Storm  Rising.  Specifically, the novel is one of action, not characters.  That's  not to say that there's no attempt at character development-there is.  And  in fact, the character development is better than early Clancy-but the  minute you begin to empathize with a character the scene shifts, and  usually that character never appears again.  Or the character is killed  off.  Or, by the time the character resurfaces, I've forgotten who he/she  is.  Personally, I get very tired of investing emotional capital in  ephemeral characters.  I'd prefer less character development of such  characters.  Clancy eventually realized this shortcoming and created permanent characters such as Ryan--at which point he became more than a cult  writer.	1999-02-28
US	52072264	R3PIQMEL08Q8VW	0440224764	999720718	The Partner	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Fast action, intiquing plot turns, and a flawed end	\\"The Partner\\", in my opinion, is Grisham's second-best novel-and  that is saying a very great deal.  The story is essentially of a lawyer who  discovers that his firm is planning, with a client, to defraud the  government, and cutting him out of the profits.  So he stages his own  disappearance, and manages to steal the money.  The companies affected in  various ways band together and hire a sleazy detective to find him.  He is  found in Brazil and almost tortured to death, and then returned to the  United States to face charges.  None of this is revealing any significant  plot because it all takes place in the first chapter.  The turns and twists  of how the lawyer manages to brilliantly tie up the legal system, and  ultimately gets away with a hand slap constitutes most of the rest of the  novel.  As in all Grisham novels, the pace and action are engrossing.  The  characters are not as completely fleshed-out as they could be.<br /><br /> The  only disappointments are in retrospect, i.e., at least three serious flaws  in the plot.  If you haven't read the novel yet, stop here.  All of these  flaws appear to have been tacked-on to the finished novel, perhaps at the  urging of an idiot editor.  One is that the lawyer is accused of having  murdered someone to take his place in his burning car when he disappears.  In fact, there is no logical reason for such a dramatic disappearance-much  less a murder to cover it.  At the time, the theft had not yet taken place  and no-one would have been looking for the lawyer if he had just quietly  disappeared.  The second serious plot flaw is that we discover in the last  chapter that he had arranged-years in advance--for his own capture.  It  would have been much safer to have been captured by a law enforcement  agency in the States-perhaps while visiting his mother.  Alternatively,  with $100 million dollars, his options for avoiding discovery were  virtually unlimited.  We are asked to believe that the lawyer is a  fantastically rich genius who has spent years planning to thwart the  system, but yet unnecessarily and intentionally allows himself to be  captured and tortured by thugs, in Brazil.  As a third highly improbable  plot twist, at the very end..y rich genius who has spent years planning to thwart the  system, but yet unnecessarily and intentionally allows himself to be  captured and tortured by thugs, in Brazil.

There is none of the marvelous psychological/philosophical insight of later Steinbeck.  The characters are flat.  The plot, necessarily constrained by real history, is without intrigue or interest.

By Tom Clancy standards, RAINBOW SIX is disappointing.  The entire first half of the novel is based on two untenable premises, 1) that a sudden increase  in terrorist activities would influence which of many competing companies  an Olympics security contract would be awarded to, and 2) that an  organization would spend 100 million dollars or so, sponsoring such random terror, when simply undercutting competitor's bids would be more effective.  Clancy's writing has achieved a high quality of excellence.  Characters  are evenly and appropriately developed for an action novel.  However, for a  Clancy novel, there isn't much action.  At times the novel is painfully slow paced.  The unnecessary repetition of philosophical an technical  points-frequently verbatim, or nearly so-gives the impression of sloppy  editing.	1999-02-08

The  remarkable size of these almost unknown industries is astonishing.  Also of  interest is the discussion of the historic potash industry.  The word \\"monograph\\" implies dry academic language, but this work manages  to be both academic and sufficiently well-written to be easy reading.  Unfortunately, some of the mining terminology and limestone chemistry is  obsolete, and difficult for non-specialists to understand.

Some  scenes are underground, and as far as I recall, accurately portray mining.  The mine suffers from rock burst and pockets of scalding pressurized water  (as the mines in the area really did), and interestingly, at one point the  miners are forced to employ quenching to excavate some particularly hard  rock.  While I assume that this is based on a true event, I've never seen  any reference to quenching in a modern underground mine elsewhere.	1999-01-14

This gritty pioneer mentality is appropriate to South Africa.<br /><br />I imagine that many readers will conclude that many of the characters in Smith's novels lack dimension. But that's a failure of people, not of the author. There ARE nasty, vengeful people in the world who are NOT complex, and Smith describes such people accurately. Smith does not attempt to explain such people-which I appreciate (in contrast with most modern novels filled with dreary shallow pop-psychology). Smith's heroes are men who manage to exceed the sum of their heredity and environment-as is often the case in the real world.	1999-01-14

Viewed as a novel, the book consists of incomplete fragments, largely out of sequence, without any plot, and with little explicit character development.<br /><br />However, the quality of the prose is exceptional and often captivating. Many of the descriptions of people and places are extraordinarily vivid. Many of the stories, as stand-alone stories, are rich, poignant, and amusing. And yet the book felt incomplete, perhaps like $500/bottle wine in a paper cup. The book ends with a lack of meaning or purpose and without resolution.  That, of course, may be the point.<br /><br />The book consists heavily of highly offensive stereotyped snapshots of the &#34;cute&#34; hopelessly stupid, alcoholic, filthy, superstitious, lazy, mentally defective, thieving, pathetic, murderous Mexican natives. Worse, it is implied that such is simply the inherent, genetic, Mexican nature---that there is no hope of improvement---even the suggestion that if improvement were possible, it would not be desirable. As though Mexico is a zoo, and Mexicans are amusing subhuman creatures.
