Finding out about them and their ideas was as much fun as it will be to read Dan Brown's next book about the Masons. Secret knowledge is always fun...forbidden fruit and all.<br /><br />Style does spend a fair amount of time in introspection, rather than simply turning this into a poor version of a 500-page issue of a Penthouse Letters book. This was one of the most refreshing things about the book. Although I disagree with his conclusions, it is nice to see the author actually consider the philosophical implications of his work.<br /><br />In all, I would say that it is a very worthwhile book. I would additionally like to give the author and publisher a pat on the back for style points in presentation. I actually had a goal upon entering the bookstore. A book I was there to purchase. However, I quickly forgot all about it, got engrossed in this, and wandered out with a goofy smile on my face. Six blocks away, I remembered my original goal.<br /><br />Something must have been done right. A very well put together book. I was well-pleased with it. While it isn't for everyone, it is interesting, and a careful read with an open mind will leave you thinking about yourself and your own behavior...a very good sign. Worth buying.<br /><br />Harkius	2005-10-13

I have read plenty of books good enough that I couldn't put them down. Eyes of the Dragon immediately leaps to mind, which is why I no longer start it on a weeknight.<br /><br />But, until now, I have never read a novel so good that I periodically had to close the book, put it down, and walk away. I can see the reason for the complaints by some of the reviewers. At times, yes, it is a bit melodramatic. However, the entire piece has a feeling of hyperreality. So real that it FEELS artificial. This is a feeling only a few books have given me, and none of them were the hack-and-slash neo-modern kitsch that goes by the term \\"cyberpunk.\\" Bear v. Shark was the other truly appropriate example.<br /><br />This book had everything that Cat's Cradle (another I read recently) did not. Adequate character development, a compelling storyline, dramatic conflict, etc. Y'know...the elements of fiction. This was a tremendously good book, and I can see why it is on the Spanish bestseller list, and why it has been for three years.<br /><br />A great book. Read it, share it, pass it on. Put it down and walk away, though, because sometimes...it seems like the author is sitting in a chair, whispering in your ear. And that, my friend, is not a terribly good feeling late at night when you expect to be all alone. Loved it!<br /><br />Harkius	2005-06-03

Call me a Philistine, but it didn't really have much in the neighborhood of character development. Or conflict. Or most of the elements of a story, for that matter.  <br /> <br />Granted, it was an entertaining read, and I can see a smile on Vonnegut's face upon reading this. He would probably look at me and say, \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" Was that the point? Was I supposed to come out of it with a nihilistic outlook? The story was short, simple, and it lacked depth. I found it lacking.  <br /> <br />Read it if you like, or don't. I don't see anything particularly compelling about it, and I am enjoying my new book much more. <br />Harkius	2005-06-03

The characterizations were a bit two-dimensional, the lines that should have been packed with meaning were a bit shallow, and the whole affair was a bit tepid.<br /><br />Why do I say that it was well written, then? If all of my comments are negative, how can I not give the book one star? Well, the book is written in a technically superb way. Much like Data's playing violin (for you Trekkies out there), the notes are all correct and the pitches are executed perfectly, but there is no feeling behind the music.<br /><br />A good effort by the author, but it almost felt as if he had lost any interest in the characters and as if Forge was demanding that he write another novel to fill his contract. If he does write another, I won't read it. It is just too much to sit through. It is one thing to technically make a wonderful piece, but it is quite another to make it, enjoy it, and make it so that it can be enjoyed. It has to feel spontaneous, not crafted.<br /><br />A good effort, but falling short. Check it out of the library, borrow it from a friend, but don't encourage this type of bibliocide with a purchase. Buy something better, instead.<br /><br />Harkius	2005-05-11

Although it at no point was so enthralling that I felt that I couldn't put it down (or even that I should read it when I felt that I should do something else, I still finished it quite rapidly.  <br /> <br />The storytelling is what made this book, not the plot or the characters. Both of the latter are staid and trite, although I must say that I like the climax of the book. But, the storytelling was what made this worthwhile for me. It was stilted, and most of the character's interactions were likewise. In effect, this gave it the same kind of strange, surreal feeling that The Office (a comedy on NBC) has. This feeling was quite entertaining. Although the book felt almost as if there was a message hidden within it (and the stengogram discussion didn't help alleviate my paranoia), I couldn't find anything worth taking away for a very long period of time.  <br /> <br />Despite the fact that it felt weird and I can't really recall much of value within the book directly, it was still very entertaining, and I will read it again someday. I enjoyed it, but I can't quite place my finger on why. <br /> <br />An interesting book, entertaining if you are in the mood, painful if you aren't. I recommend checking it out, rather than purchasing it. <br />Harkius	2005-05-04

I particularly enjoyed the mockery of the portrayal of Islamic Fascism, as well as the convincing attempt to portray this as not necessarily the most popular branch, but certainly more popular than people believe. His discussion of the popularity not mattering in preference to the power was also interesting, and amusing. All told, it was an amazing, not to mention prescient (it was written in 1995 after all), satire of the opinions of the Neo-Conservative.  <br /> <br />What's that you say? It was meant to be taken seriously? You're joking, right? Drat. Guess I will have to rethink my review.  <br /> <br />Seriously, this book is nearly a joke. After spending the first half of the book or so writing convincing, but flawed, arguments, the author degenerated into two sections about Islam and the role it plays as the \\"barbarians\\" of the Twenty-First Century. He claims that this is a historic role, as well, despite the fact that, were it not for Islam, we wouldn't have many of the classical works that we do today. Ignore that fact at your peril, Mr. Bloom, as it flies in the face of the behavior of your other cited Barbarian groups, many of whom were not particularly literate. And some of whom, at least, were pluralistic. <br /> <br />So, to list off the myriad scientific and cultural misunderstandings of our dear Mr. Bloom would take more time and space than I have or Amazon will allow. But, a smattering of the more egregious scientific sins will likely suffice. First, Mr. Bloom is not, nor has he ever been, a sociologist or a scientist. Instead, we are told that he was trained as a scientist, but then decided to avoid the strangling world of academia in favor of promoting the careers of Michael Jackson and John Cougar Mellencamp. This does not, I believe, qualify him as a source of authority on many issues. Likely, he failed as a scientist, and he then looked around for a career he could excel at. Apparently alarmist psuedo-scientific writings was it. <br /> <br />So, on with the misunderstandings. First of all, our dear Mr. Bloom claims, foolishly, that our brain is made up of three parts. He calls this the triune brain. He claims that it is descended from three types of ancestors. The \\"animal\\" brain comes from reptiles, amphibians, etc., and seems to be comprised largely of the cerebellum and the brainstem. The \\"mammalian\\" brain involves the remainder of the cortex, and the \\"human\\" brain is the newly derived neocortex. What he fails to understand, utterly, is that this may be biologically true, but fall far short of accuracy. Intelligence and awareness, along with other nervous functions, are emergent properties. Speech is largely controlled by the Broca's region, found in the cortex. Mammals aside from us do not speak. Discussion of whether this is due to our larynx aside, this points out a serious flaw in the author's thinking. The origin of our brains plays little or no role in their current function. Go look up the idea of analogous physical features, Mr. Bloom.  <br /> <br />Next, there is a brief period of mockery for Mr. Bloom's advocation of Freudian psychology. Ha ha! Further comment is unnecessary. <br /> <br />In a more overarching theme, and giving grounds for my comment that he likely failed in science, Mr. Bloom CONSISTENTLY mistakes several scientific ideas. One is overinterpretation of data. I cannot cite any particular cases off-hand, but in multiple locations through the book, he will interpret data far beyond reasonable and credible levels to attempt to make some grand point, often a highly contentious one. A hint Mr. Bloom: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. It is a basic tenet of science. Further, he mistakes the ideas of causation and correlation, which is a funamentally trained difference in all sciences. I CAN think of an example on this front. He cites the correlation of animals/Islamic families failure to treat their children with compassion and affection with increased potential for violence. This is not really something that can be argued. It has been proven time and again. However, whether this CAUSES the violence has not. To merely gloss over this fact suggests to me that the world of science should rise up and refuse to acknowledge that this man was EVER successfully trained as a scientist.  <br /> <br />In short, the book is interesting enough in its speculations, but the deviant understandings of data, along with the ethnocentric observations are irritating and call into question the trends that he attempts to prove, simply because you must wonder, without independent confirmation of EVERY fact, whether he has misinterpreted them as well.  <br /> <br />In addition, he has a glaring logical problem that I will address quite briefly. Despite citing a mass of \\"proof\\" that humans are predictably going to turn toward violent and status-seeking behaviors, Mr. Bloom claims that pluralistic societies (in space, perhaps) will find a way to peacefully spread our memes and overcome our \\"primitive\\" nature. Mr. Bloom, you are living in a fantastic land of delusion. A non-violent spread of memes is merely the next logical method of spread: without your followers being killed, your meme will spread more successfully. Much like increased birth rates amongst believers, this is simply a propagation method. It is no better, or worse, than forcefully converting others to your policies.  <br /> <br />In short, a controversial book, riddled with problems and a few gems. If you have the time and the money to waste, go ahead and read it. If you have something better to do (like pick your nose with a fork), I would suggest that instead. Good luck with this. <br />Harkius	2005-04-30

I went into this treatise expecting to be irritated and expecting to find someone who did not know what they were talking about. I was wrong on both accounts. <br /> <br />Wright does a good job of theorizing on the driving forces of cultural and biological evolution, claiming that both are driven by intrinsic cost-benefit analyses that are basically enforced by that brute of the biological world: survival. If we weigh our analysis improperly, we will not have a chance to regret it. To a certain extent, he is correct. His arguments are lucid and rational, at least for the majority of the book.  <br /> <br />However, at one point I must confess that our dear Mr. Wright left the road of rationality, driving headlong into the realm of near-psychotic hatred of Stephen Jay Gould. Now, admittedly, I don't agree with Dr. Gould's theories of evolution either. Particularly his viewpoint on punctuated equilibrium. However, Dr. Gould is a trained biologist, and a world-known expert in the field of evolutionary theory. As near as I can tell from Mr. Wright's mangled ideas of DNA (at one point he claims that it is not only a blueprint for proteins, but that it unconsciously \\"decides\\" which proteins to create, which is a technical falsity. As a trained molecular biologist, I can honestly say this is not a common or widely held point of view, mainly because proteins serve these functions), Mr. Wright is an anthropologist. To be clear, he does have a good grasp of the facts of evolution, but he is not the expert that Dr. Gould is. Therefore, when Mr. Wright, on page 393, claims that Dr. Gould's arguments are based on biases and not on reasoned facts seems short-sighted. In fact, he spends nearly 30-40 pages trying to savage the arguments of Dr. Gould, and claims, with what credible basis I am not informed enough to discuss, that Dr. Gould's arguments are false. <br /> <br />This is really the major problem that I had with this book. The other problem was a small point really. While Mr. Wright acknowledges the forces of irrationality in the decisions of heads of state and the possession of peoples of weapons capable of wiping out an entire city or state in one fell swoop, he fails to tie these two critical pieces of information together. He argues that societies making poor, zero-sum evaluations are eventually ground into dust by history, but he fails to adequately acknowledge the fact that they may take a good portion of the world's population with them. He seems to know this, and doesn't seem concerned, which really isn't my problem. My main problem is that he fails to see this as a dent in his rosy imaginations of the future of our species.  <br /> <br />Overall, well argued and well thought out. Several glaring fallacies do exist, but they are not enough to destroy enjoyment of the book. Good job. This book should be as widely read as the reviews of it suggest that it is. If you are interested in cultural anthropology, or decision science, then this may be a good pick for you. If not, pass it by for the latest Grisham thriller.  <br /> <br />Harkius	2005-04-11

Despite this, I enjoyed the book.  <br /> <br />The protagonist of the story is bedeviled by his own understanding, and he suffers from the curse of the self-aware: his existence is bourgois and has no point. Seeking to avoid this realization, he attempts to find ways to deprive himself of this knowledge, including the aforementioned alcoholism, suicide, HappyZac (not to be confused with that other well-known SSRI), and other delightful distractions of modern life.  <br /> <br />My biggest problem with the book, surprisingly, was not its pretentious nature, which I enjoyed, as it was perfect typecasting for the narrator. Rather, I didn't accept the nature of the character development. Most people will read this and understand what I mean, so I won't spoil the story. Suffice it to say, the results of spilling coffee on your keyboard are not what he was looking for, and the suggestion that this somehow led him where he ended up was a bit farcical and forced.  <br /> <br />I must also confess a sort of bitter ambivalence toward the book as a result of having seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind recently, and the Conclusion of the book had a rather Deus ex Machina result that left me feeling a bit like Alice. The only thing that I could connect to was the movie, and I felt that was unfortunate. <br /> <br />A good book, well worth the afternoon it takes to read it. Read it, share it, pass it on. Don't consider it an instruction manual, though. Unless you are into that kind of thing. In which case, Backa! <br />Harkius	2005-01-26

When a book is predictable, and tame, then I am usually tapping my fingers, waiting to see the spectacular ending. In this case, the ending almost made me wince. Suffice it to say that I thought there would be more conspiracy involved in the ending, and I expected that the story would have more plot twists and turns.  <br /> <br />In reality, this book should never be compared to The Da Vinci Code. Having read that novel several times, I am always reminded of the twists and turns that kept me interested. This book was tame, and its rerelease upon the wave of interest in this subject started by Brown was irritating especially due to the rather tepid nature of this book.  <br /> <br />If you want more of The Da Vinci Code, read Angels and Demons.

I don't know that there was any one thing in specific about this book that left the bad impression that it did, but I am sure that the composite left me dissatisfied. <br />First of all, the book points out, quite reassuringly, that it was printed in 1983, to tell you that it is not just a rip-off of The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown. Then, there are glaring problems that make me wonder what types of revisions they made. For example, there is a reference to a politician who &quot;been killed eleven years ago in one of the 9/11 aircraft that crashed into the World Trade Center.&quot; Hmmm...thats a bit quirky. This man accurately predicted a disaster some eighteen years ahead of time, and yet, no one ever heard of it. <br />Then, there are the editorial problems, one of which was the worst I have ever seen. The back blurb refers to a Da Vinci scholar named Curtis Davis, who NEVER APPEARS IN THE BOOK! I can only assume that they changed all of the instances (or none) of Curtis Davis's name to Vance Erikson. <br />Another lovely presentation problem was their placing on the cover: The Da Vinci Codex is missing, which is an obvious reference to it's competition, The Da Vinci Code. This way annoying and insulting, and when combined with the rest of the problems, made the format of the book very unenticing. <br />On to the meat and potatoes of the book: First off, the pacing was not very good, which is critical for an action-adventure. There needs to be a smooth climb to the climax, not a herky-jerky stop-and-start roller-coaster ride. <br />Furthermore, the antagonists were not unique, convincing, or interesting, thus making it a more intellectual exercise than it was a fight-for-your life thriller. I was more interested in finding out what the machine did, which was greatly disappointing, than I was in discovering if the main villain could be stopped.<br />Overall, it was quite dissatisfying. The only redeeming merit that it had was that it seems fairly well-researched, which will earn it a bonus point from me.<br />Don't but it. Borrow it from the library or a friend, read it once.

One player goes into diabetic shock while the other has a coincidental pacemaker problem that makes it possible for a game-death to kill him. <br />Other than that difficulty, it is entertaining and a fun story. No real issues of great import are ever discussed in the novel, but it is a book for fun, not for serious contemplation. The three main characters are interesting, though, and they do have a fun story, even if it isn't terribly compelling. <br />Walter is an emotionally scarred ex-policeman who was assaulted by a vicious wife-beater (who should have died, quite frankly), and who is seeking escape in virtual reality. Baal is an emotionally scarred teenage girl who was diagnosed with diabetes and who has a tragedy-fraught romantic life. She wants to find out what dying is like, and thinks that VR is the best way to find out before she finally commits. <br />Their story is interesting and believable, and the action carries it through the parts that don't make as much sense and where characterization fails a bit, but it makes a fun, cohesive whole. <br />It's not a brain-bender by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a very fun read that I recommend.

This book is exceptionally gory and it doesn't ever reach an intellectual point or conclusion. Those are the sole negative aspects of it.<br />The characterization is pretty good for a shooter novel, and it is a fun book that actually succeeds at giving some type of story to the concept of DOOM, the bestselling First Person Shooter (FPS) game that really got the computer gaming industry going in storm. This is quite surprising, as the game itself tends to ignore the story, quite rightly. Nothing is more annoying than a transparent, crappy attempt at giving a story to a game that doesn't really need one. The great thing about this book is that it doesn't really give a crappy attempt, it actually succeeds. It also gives reasonable justification for the characters traveling down the base into the parts that are densest in monsters.<br />The book also does a good job of explaining normal human reactions to the types of things that the characters would experience in DOOM.<br />It's a great book and it is really fun to read.

For the majority of the book he uses New Guineans in his examples, and he, strangely, refers to New Guinea as a mini-continent on a frequent basis, which is strange to me, since it is quite small, and, in both economic and political terms, unimportant on a world-wide basis. His infatuation with the culture and the island, I think, hurts the book. <br />In other places, he makes references to certain facts, I don't recall what they are off-hand, that are not true, most especially having to do with disease etiology and origins. Actually, I do remember one, where he cites influenza as having origins in swine, where it really comes from fowl, and it is amplified and altered by genetic recombination in swine. This also undermines his credibility, and these factors hurt the ability of the author to make persuasive arguments, making it difficult to accept them.<br />I would recommend reading it to people, but only with caution. Like everything else, think about it when you read it, but take more caution than normal, as the author is very intelligent and quite persuasive, but potentially fundamentally flawed.<BR>Harkius	2003-12-06

What I find most atrocious about this despicable little attempt at a self-help book is its hipocracy. If the author thought that he was giving true insight for the best of other people, that would be one thing, and he would give the book away for free. Instead, the book costs thirteen dollars, two dollars of each copy probably goes to the author. I don't think that he is in it for the good of others or to &quot;share the truth&quot;. I think that he wants to milk this little cow for all it is worth. All he needs now is a celebrity sponsor to &quot;change their life&quot; and he would have a fortune on his hands. <br />If you want more proof, look at the seminars, companion books, workbooks, etc that he allows to be put out. This isn't about what is right; it's about what is profitable. Even that wouldn't be so obnoxious if people weren't willing to swallow it. Instead, people say that this book changes their lives. It doesn't. Only you can change your life. No book will do it for you. This book is annoying, obnoxious, and hypocritical. <br />If I had the chance, I would go back in time and refuse to read it.

It seems to be just a bunch of essays that are by people who are famous and who slightly modified another essay that they had already written in order to make them apply to The Matrix as well. Only three or so of the essays directly applied, and one of them didn't mention the movie at all (although that essay was noted as having been written before the movie and was included as a prophetic statement). Of these essays, one focused entirely on whether the technology in The Matrix was possible, which wasn't entirely interesting to me. <br />Other essays, notably the religious ones, were quite amusing, as religion was never really intended to be a main theme of the movie, although philosophy was. The author (can't remember his name off hand, but I am sure you can look at the table of contents) who said that The Matrix was a Christian movie was quite entertaining, although a bit...inaccurate. He compared Neo to Jesus (of course) and cited Biblical scripture about the Messiah coming and being a military and spiritual leader, which is funny, since that isn't what Jesus did at all. <br />The author comparing it to Buddhism seemed similarly deluded, since The Matrix is an anthem of personal choice and individuality, which is not at all what Buddhism is all about. Granted, there are overtones of both in the movie, but they are both wrong that the movie instills their religious viewpoints. It is, however, interesting to note that such widely disparate religions could both think that the movie referred to their religion. Perhaps they are not as far apart as they think? Perhaps they simply fell into the trap of confirmation bias. <br />Either way, it is a fairly fun read, but not because it will give you any terribly new thoughts on the movie...rather, it will allow you to see why the movie was so popular. It meant many things to many people, and the creators did a great job of manufacturing a movie that allowed people to suspend disbelief, even if for only a moment.<br />The book is all right, but I would rent it from a library instead of purchasing it again. I will likely only read it once. <BR>You may find it to be better. Good luck.<BR>Harkius	2003-10-04

Christopher Moore manages irreverence (pun intended) at the expense of Jesus Christ without doing so in a way that will even offend intelligent Christians. Fundamentalists will not enjoy this book, but they aren't exactly fun-loving people, so that isn't really all that surprising. <br />Christopher Moore has his protagonist telling the story of Josh, the young Messiah who isn't really sure that he is up to the job. The young leader realizes his destiny from near the start of the book, but he manages to be fairly lighthearted about it most of the time. Biff is a great voice, one of the best I've read recently, as he is a loyal sinner, confident in his pal and willing to die for him. <br />The book has a fun time of talking about Josh and Biff wandering around the East and learning about Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. It is fun to see Christopher Moore criticize the faiths, but I would have preferred that he had criticized Buddhism while he was at it. He let it off the hook far too easily. He criticized Judaism, blind Christianity, Hinduism, and even the other Eastern faith, can't remember which one. <br />The book is fun, and it is a good thinker. It did make me pause and consider my life path, which isn't all that common, and it gets a bonus just for that. I love it. Buy it, share it, and think about it. It's great!<BR>Harkius	2003-09-29
US	40897880	R1JUJOEJMVUAI4	1588462196	286326706	Midnight Siege	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Well Done.	This book was well written, and it gave a lot of good ideas for conflicts and storylines in times of war. It also focused on the types of goals that each group has (Camarilla, Sabbat, and Independent) as well as common actions they would take and when. Not only that, but there were some very interesting surprises, as well. All told, it was well written.<br />Unfortunately, it was not quite perfect. For example, the editing was done poorly in some places. Misspelled words should never make it into a publication. The other reviewer is right, as well, about the art. Much of it is too dark to make anything useful out. I like the trend away from the lame cartoony art, but the noir is not much better.<br />Good for a storyteller, probably extraneous for others.<BR>Harkius	2003-09-18

US	40897880	R1T2FRN50YUJVC	0553762109	87066635	Death Dream	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Very Well Done	This book was written very well. Featuring a slew of fun, dysfunctional characters, it would only take a small stretch of existential angst for me to give it a 5th star. As it is, though, it is merely a precautionary tale of the dangers that virtual reality may bring to the world. Precautionary tales are nice, and sometimes they are fun (like this one is), but they don't really have the meaning to earn that 5th star. <br />This is the first book I have read by Mr. Bova, and I think that it is good, with some small imperfections. He has a certain writing style that is somewhat stilted to me, and it is sometimes hard to read. I can't place my finger on exactly what it is, though. It may be overusage of the character's names, or it may be the fact that the characters are a bit hackneyed, but whatever it is, it is somewhat annoying, like a tiny piece of flesh hanging from the top of your mouth...you know what it is and you want to fix it, but you can't really get directly at it, so you just worry it around with your tongue. <br />Other than the lack of any real substance and the small writing annoyance, the book was very good overall, and I am quite impressed. Don't get me wrong, the book is fun to read, and I will read it again sometime in the future, it just won't alter my perceptions of the world in any measurable fashion. <br />It is an exciting book, though, and it is fun to see Kyle Muncrief's whole world fall down around his sick, twisted feet, and I can't see why anyone should have to face repercussions for the consequences of his last VR sim.<br />That's just me though. Read it, enjoy it, and pass it on. Definitely a buyer.<BR>Harkius	2003-08-26
US	40897880	R1OSBYCNLMNNYJ	0312963009	638192149	Neanderthal	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Not Bad for Its Genre	This is a very easily classifiable work. It is the &quot;unknown man-like creature&quot; genre. Such other notable works in this grouping are Congo by Michael Crichton and The Descent by Jeff Long. And, if you are interested in reading a book from this grouping, read The Descent. If you are going to read another, read Congo. If you are bored out of your mind and want a break from life and like this genre, go ahead and pick this up.<br />As far as the genre goes, this book does nothing to really forward it. It has the same type of plot line as the others, and it doesn't really ever vary from it the way that they do. In fact, it never really gets you involved in the story. The adjectives used are uninspired and the characters involved are easy to feel dispassionate about. In the end, you aren't really going to care who lives and who dies. Actually, there are two exceptions to that: Two characters really seem like they deserve to die and one of them does, so I was pretty happy about that.<br />Other than that, though, it doesn't really have too very much to recommend it. It isn't a bad book, per se, but it does nothing to make itself stand out in my mind the way that Congo and The Descent do. Whereas this is simply a novel, Congo is a page-turner, and The Descent is an epic. That book creates a whole new world for you to explore, and when you close the book, you wonder, just for a second, whether it may not be true. Never, at any point, did I worry about a neanderthal while I was reading this. <br />It wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good. It was, above all else, average for the genre, with no exceptional characteristics. Pass on it, unless you love the plot line, and have already read the better ones.<BR>Harkius	2003-08-21

There are not a lot of surprises or twists in the plot, but it is no less fun as a result of those absences. It is a fun read, and it is short enough for a plane trip, a couple hours on the beach, or just a short evening on the couch in front of the fireplace and radio. <br />In short, if you like Predator (not the second movie, it [was bad]), and you wanted a bit more action, pick this up. You won't be disappointed. If you are looking for something that requires a little bit of thought, keep looking you haven't found it yet. But, like I said, great for a two-hour brain-break.

Rather like Dostyevsky's Crime and Punishment (without the second half), the book focuses on a man who is desperately trying to fulfill an obsession that he has. In this case, it is an iconologist (different from an iconographer, don't ya know), who becomes completely, irrationally, and annoyingly obsessed with bringing to light what he believes is a long-forgotten, long-lost masterpiece. <br />During the course of the book, we are subjected to probably at least 100 pages of Dutch history between the ages of 1530 and 1570.  This would all be well and good if the book didn't consist of 340 pages. That is correct, almost 1/3 of this book is history from forty years. Forty years that were not terribly important in the grand scheme of European history. The fact that we are subjected to it in such mundane detail is painful. The fact that, in the end, it all comes to naught, is even worse. <br />Other reviewers have called it a mystery, and I think that is misleading. From the start, we know, simply know, that the fool will take the painting, by hook or by crook. He is obsessed, and, like a drug addict, he will do anything to fulfill his need, even mortgaging his child's future. This may be part of what one of the other reviewers referred to (along with the extramarital &quot;relations&quot;) when they said it was part morality play, which I can accept. Boring, but about morality, sure.<br />There are some novel things in this book. For example, his interpretations of the complex silences between his wife and himself are kind of interesting. However, that gets old really, really fast. I purchased this book expecting something like a cross between Gregory Blake Smith's &quot;The Divine Comedy of John Venner&quot; and Arturo Perez-Reverte's &quot;The Flanders Panel&quot;. I was sorely disappointed. It had the history of the latter, indeed, and the moral difficulties of the former, but it had far too much of both and not enough payoff to make reading it worthwhile. I am sincerely glad that I only paid four dollars for it.<br />If you want moral plays, find The Divine Comedy of John Venner. If you want art history in a fun, fictional format, findThe Flanders Panel or The Da Vinci Code. Skip this. It isn't really worthwhile unless you want to punish yourself.<BR>Harkius	2003-08-18

This, at least, is true and useful. There are some very positive aspects of the book. For example, &quot;A convincing case can be made that the entire free enterprise system is based on envy.&quot; Such is one nugget of wisdom from the book. However, a majority of it never rises to that level. <br />Instead, we are forced to listen to Harry Stein begrudge his friends and enemies and himself the natural human inclinations that we all experience. In addition, he spends a good deal of time trumpeting his own horn about how he doesn't experience those feelings that we all do.  It is obnoxious at best and unbearable at worst. Part of the obnoxiousness of it, really, is the knowledge that he is frequently right. Jealousy and revenge are low and should be avoided. But, his crowing about how he does that already is pointless and irritating. <br />The book suffers from those problems and more. It never really has the inspired knowledge that the back or other reviewers claim. I am truly doubtful that it will change your life. I don't think that anyone reading this book will really change the world. In the end, it is merely an annoyance and doesn't serve any real end.<br />I would be upset that I had this book if I had purchased it. I would be grateful that I had it if I borrowed it. However, it was given to me by a stranger for free, so I am going to return the favor. I will give it to a stranger and cross my fingers. Maybe (I personally doubt it) it will fall into the hands of someone who will find it useful. Don't buy it, don't read it. Mostly, don't bother.<BR>Harkius	2003-08-14

This was his first real novel, and it was rather more simplistic in certain ways than his later novels. That is not to say that it is a bad book; it is excellent and well worth the price of admission. However, the characterizations are not quite as rich, the plots are a bit easier to see through, and so on. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it is just that Mr. Brown had not fully developed his style as a professional writer yet.<br />This novel was about cryptographers and teachers. Much as always, geeks are the heroes in this work, and they are good ones at that. Mr. Brown seems to be quite interested in secrets and also in teaching them to others. All four of his most popular books (Digital Fortress, Deception Point, Angels and Demons, and The Da Vinci Code) center on rather covert agencies and ideas and in all of them there is a pedagogical figure who is interested in explaining to others the secrets and how they are kept. <br />In the end, this novel follows the general pattern of all of his and of all action-suspense works. It is a fairly well-defined genre. However, the joy in Mr. Brown's work is not in its inherent originality; rather, it is in learning new things (which happens for most of us with each of his books...he has a rather esoteric collection of wisom and makes some positively strange and delightful connections), watching the geeks save the day, and seeing the characters live up to their potentials. <br />Much like his other books, this is a great work, and it is definately worthwhile. If you read only one book this month, read this book. (I have difficulties with the conception that the average American reads one book each year...). Buy it, read it, enjoy it, and share it. <br />Lovely book, Mr. Brown. Great stuff. Keep it up.<BR>Harkius	2003-08-13
US	40897880	R1M32LPSD1UUFH	0743458982	972674723	Hardwired (Transformers, Book 1)	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Vaguely Similar to Mutant Empire	I may give this book a higher rating if not for that. However, as yet, it isn't even a really good copy. Transformers will never have the same impact as the X-Men. It just won't happen, since Transformers are not really relatable, but everyone feels like a mutant sometimes. The storytelling isn't necessarily bad, it just is too much deja vu. <br />In addition to that, the editing was atrocious. Some things are forgivable: forgetting to hyphenate a complex adjective isn't very surprising. However, when words are misspelled, in the wrong tense, MISSING, or otherwise mangled, it makes it difficult to read an otherwise sub-par book. <br />Not a book that I would buy again. Matter of fact, I probably won't buy the rest of the series, either. This is not the Transformers you remember. They are all whiny and uninteresting and the editing is terrible. Barely a reader, not a buyer. Rent it or borrow it instead. Ciencin can do much better, though. For example, read The Night Parade. Fairly frightening and very graphic. A great book with a lot of cool imagery. This seems hastily put together in comparison. I wouldn't be surprised to find book two within three months. I really wouldn't bother. <BR>Harkius	2003-08-11

Instantly, I went out and bought this. I was not as impressed by this novel, although it was very good. <br />First off, the characterizations were not as rich, as pure. Some of the characters were poorly detailed. Don Octavio is a good example. I was never really clear on his importance in the story. He never played a critical role, seeming to be an unnecessary character. His role in several relationships was important, but as a character, he seemed lacking. The Three villains were another good example. They were largely one dimensional: The fat, old, hedonistic leader. The lost and lovely, but compromised, singer, young at heart, protected by the men. And the battered, punch-drunk, silly, and far too loyal boxer. They are one dimensional and at best, I simply wanted them to die so that I wouldn't have to read about them anymore. I almost got my hope due to their unflinching stupidity, but I was saddened to discover their return. <br />However, that is not to say the book was entirely bad. The story itself was a familiar one, from many a dime-store novel. But, as with all classic stories, the value is in the telling, not in the originality. Father Quart was interesting, and it was fun to watch him come of age. Yes, that is right. The story is largely a tale of the coming-of-age of a middle-aged priest. Many people call it a mystery, but it isn't really all that mysterious. I knew whodunnit, as it is so charmingly written, shortly after it was done. There were not a lot of surprises, certainly not enough to make it a mystery. Granted, it does follow that pattern of a story line, and none of the characters (including two of the priests central to the story) are sinless, but it really isn't about that. It is a tale of discovery, of hope, of love. That, my friends, is not a mystery. It is a coming-of-age story that is parading itself as a mystery, and in that role, it is excellent. <br />The technical details are a bit boring, so I have left them for last. The book is well put together, although the chapters could have been a bit shorter (like all of Perez-Reverte's books...is it possible that American's merely have a short attention span?). The translator was not as flawless, as there are some turns of phrase that are quite bizarre and discontinous. Twirling one's cigar in one's mouth is not an activity for which I would personally use the term 'voluptously', but that may be a matter more of style than translation. However, things like that were not in the last book, so I suspect that it is translational. The singing that oen of the three villains does almost always is a bit obnoxious, a trend I hope is reserved to this novel. Last, but not least, a few more translations of Spanish and Latin titles would be helpful. I have elementary knowledge of both languages, but there were times when I was completely unable to make out what was being said. <br />A good book, overall, and a fun read. I recommend it. It will join the ranks of my &quot;Borrow to my friends&quot; novels.<BR>Harkius	2003-08-09

The book was quite well put together, although the narrator seems to come and go with a rather disconcerting lack of note...<br />The book would be useful, as I said, for people without a lot of manipulating experience. With a little bit of experience, you can start putting things from here together in inventive ways, and with a little more, you can easily outstrip the suggestions in this book and accomplish far more devilish ends. <br />A good book for new players and for the inexperienced. Otherwise, not terribly exciting. Use your own judgement on this one. <BR>Harkius	2003-08-06

And, in general, I agree with all of the things that they say. <br />However, the book is far from flawless. First of all, anytime that the book refers to sodium or cholesterol, they mean milligrams, not grams. This is a potentially fatal difference if you are not aware of what is going on. Secondly, unlike they did with fat, the authors did not point out the absolutely crucial nature of cholesterol. Being an animal fat, it isn't present in vegetables, but it is an important dietary supplement in very small amounts for the manufacture and maintenance of cell membranes. Thirdly, they make a true statement that excess protein in your diet can hamper calcium absorption, and can even promote calcium loss, but they fail to mention that you would have to eat such high amounts of protein that you would know that something was wrong. Amongst other disorders you would experience are gout and proteinuria, a shedding of excess proteins in the urine. At least the latter and most likely the former would occur before you would have to worry about osteoporosis as a result of excess protein. So, take what they say about protein with a grain of salt; follow USDA guidelines and you should be fit and healthy. Also, consult a doctor or dietician to determine your ideal amount of protein as well.<br />Other than that, an excellent book both for those considering the path and those who have recently begun to travel it. I shall pass it on.<BR>...	2003-07-28

Nystrom, who has hunted through the Mesozoic, Spanish Jamaica, Roman Germany, Stalin's Russia, Kubilai's China, and finally Arthur's Rome now gives up as being defeated just because he gets bonked on the head? C'mon!! This was a fun series because Nystrom was so very monomaniacal. Failing to accept for the entire six-book series that he would be treated in any way BUT unfair, all of the sudden we are expected to believe that he has changed his mind, just like that? It doesn't make sense and it just doesn't jibe. A truly disappointing ending for the novel, although the rest of it wasn't too bad. <br />Unfortunately, though, at no point does the author seem to be very interested in telling the story. The Steve and Jane plot line leads to an expected direction with foretold conclusions, but that wasn't enough to overcome the rest of the ending. A rather blase ending to a really fun and energetic series. Perhaps a lesser known time or one more interesting to the author would have picked up his enthusiasm and helped us out. <br />The dialogue was still sketchy, although far better by now, and the conclusion was a little compacted, but the technical parts of the story were not the failing this time. <br />An unfortunate end, but important for closure. Plus Steve and Jane finally get together. Worthwhile in the end more for the other books than on its own merit. Read it and enjoy it, but probably only once.	2003-07-24

The time of Stalin and Hitler is not a time that you can have fun reading about unless there is something deeply wrong with you.<br />However, the book manages to retain a light tone and avoids the concentration camps in favor of military camps. The dangerous and unpredictable climate (both social and meteorological) is shown adequately for us to remember where we are, but not so heavy handed as to make the book wholly depressing. Well-handled. <br />Steve and Jane's romance is proceeding apace, despite Steve's being a jerk. Feeling jealous over the young Roman soldier, Steve initially decides that he is not going with the team, but he is drawn into the adventure regardless, and it is done seamlessly. The dialogue is getting better, but it is still a bit stilted and unpracticed.<br />Overall, a good read.

For the first time, though, we get a better idea of what Dr. Nystrom is like. He is a monomaniacal, paranoid delusional, schizophrenic. Convinced that his creations will be taken away and that he will never have a chance to examine them fairly (the other roboticists are out to get him, don't ya know), any compromise is unacceptable to him. Ergo, he is willing to kidnap, lie, steal, and cheat in order to capture the MC gestalt robots. <br />Like the others, this novel is best for a precocious, young teenager. The history is fairly well researched, and it makes for an interesting and dramatic backdrop to the story. This book also has the added value of watching Steve get frustrated and upset with Jane, since a young Roman Legionnaire (what the author, unfortunately, keeps referring to as legionaries) is trying to woo her and she is obviously smitten by his war-like skills. This, of course, precipitates some jealousy and stupid behavior by team-members (not as bad as Rita in the second book, though). <br />All told, a worthwhile book. Fun to read, you'll probably read it more than once, so it is a good investment. I recommend it.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-17

The overarching theme is that a robot that is the administrator for a city has gone missing and he has divided himself into six gestalt robots and scattered himself through time. This installment is set in 1668 in Port Royal, Jamaica.<br />Other than Rita being such an annoying waste of skin in the book, it is a lot of fun to read. I swear, though, she is obnoxious enough that you almost want to reach in the book and slap her. She has romanticized a period of bloody history completely out of reality and therefore tries to defend her buccaneer boyfriend/kidnapper. <br />The rest of the book is an interesting read, though. The science is a bit sketchy, involving Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and chaos theory. The interpretations are good, and it would be an excellent book for people between 10 and 15, as long as they are precocious enough to have heard of the two theories and can be assumed to understand how they may interact. The scientific details are good and the discussions are realistic and interesting.<br />The remainder of the dialogue is a bit sketchy, though. Sometimes the characters say things that don't make sense, like one person giving their opinion, and then another agreeing and then the first actually agreeing with himself. The dialogue is also frequently stilted, and doesn't seem like it comes from someone with much practice in discussing things. It is fun to watch Steve and Jane's awkward romance burgeoning, though.<br />A fun read, and a quick one if you read fast. Good book. Recommended.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-16
US	40897880	R3RVTKWSCWT34L	0786914270	948617054	The Temptation of Elminster: The Elminster Series	Books	2	6	7	N	N	A Disappointing Read	Afer a ho-hum start and a great sequel, I was anxious to read this novel. I was quite disappointed when I read it though. Although one reviewer did point out (truthfully enough) that it has some interesting discussion on what Elminster is like to the rest of the Realms, this is not terribly useful in a series that is supposed to be about his history, since we can glean that information from his countless other appearances. <br />Rather, this book was quite disappointing because it didn't seem to have any purpose. The title doesn't even matter until the last ten pages of the book or so, and even then it is sketchy as it is obvious by now what his choice will be. The villains of the piece are either repetitive or so poorly characterized that they are almost painful to read about. There is an interesting part about the Priests of Shar, but it is never really developed into something worthwhile. So, in the end, you have a poor plot, bad characterization, an incredibly weak climax, and poor resolution. Five stars? How? <br />I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, unless they can read it in a day or so, so that they wouldn't waste too much time. C'mon Ed, you can do MUCH better. Try harder.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-15

It is a book about discovering yourself through all outlets: pain, thought, suffering, sexuality, sensuality, etc. This is more of a Sabbat outlook than a Camarilla one, so it is more appropriate for those characters.<br />That set aside, it is not really all that helpful a resource. Some of the book was obviously researched, I can tell that from my own studies. However, much of it was merely Lilith bemoaning her fate. Dark Mother indeed. Where is this Mother's self-sufficiency, her self-confidence, her satisfaction at what she is done? Nowhere. It is a book about her whining and using her powers to seduce those she hates until she meets her love, Lucifer. <br />While that is all very interesting, the art is neither detailed nor differentiated. The only really interesting pictures are toward the end, where Lilith is dressed in the outfits of Pharoh, and where she holds Lucifer's sword and prepares to slaughter her enemies. The text is not as poetic as you would be likely to think, if you had read The Book of Nod or The Erciyes Fragments, both of which are wonderful and highly recommended. If you have need of more of that, go ahead and pick this up. If you have players who are Lilins, go ahead and have them pick this up. If you are interested in vampire flavor, this is not really for you. It shuns vampires mainly, and it is not really useful for them.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-15

A prime example of what I label Existentialist Fiction, the protagonist is a self-accepted geek who finds the meaning of life to be a metaphor located in video games. But not contemporary ones where you are allowed, almost, the same intellectual wandering as with TV, but rather the arcade classics of his youth: Pac-Man, Space Invaders, etc. These, according to him, were the pinnacle of human entertainment. <br />The novel proceeds through the standard motions of the postmodern angst novel, boy meets girl, boy tries to figure out what life is about, boy loses girl giving his life definition, boy finds new girl, etc. However, the ending is quite unique: instead of one concluding chapter, there are four, all called Replay. All four are different though, and it seems to be a case of pick whichever ending you like the best. While quite arrogant, the ending actually works, for some reason that I can't quite understand. It's arrogant and conceited, but it works and it is fun. <br />The book was really good with some very witty observations on life. I highly recommend it. It is a worthwhile read, and I think that anyone who likes Existentialist Fiction will enjoy it. Buy it, read it, share it, and enjoy it. <BR>Harkius	2003-07-14

However, I take issue with the other aspect's of that person's review. The &quot;fact&quot; that the most beautiful of all elf-waifs falling in love with Elminster isn't even true. The most beautiful elf-waif wants to USE Elminster and loves him less than the rest of his enemies. Two elves love him: The Keeper of the Tomb, and his fellow captive. Secondly, the elves are portrayed with quite a bit of realism, just not in the way that the reviewer would like. Many people read about elves and dream of being one to escape dirty, greedy, selfish humans. If you are one of those people, this is not for you. <br />However, if you like to read about what an ancient people with thousands of years in their lifespan might be like, it is for you. Ed portrays the elves as being much like White Wolf's vampires. If you aren't familiar with the concept, they are selfish, greedy, malevolent, manipulative beings, bent on controlling everything and being quite egomaniacal about their own nature. If you have read this book, this will immediately sound familiar to you, as this is exactly how all of the elves behave. <br />In short, Ed Greenwood did that most forbidden of fantasy novel things: He didn't leave the ugliness of our world behind when he wrote it, and, thus, created characters that you can hate. Characters that aren't even noble while they are evil, but are simply selfish and cruel. The elves are insulated and xenophobic, casually cruel in places, and concerned only with their own existence. In short, they are all you would expect of an arrogant race that lives thousands of years. They are realistic. None of this noble houses of morality banalness. Rather, they are believable. You will hate the Starym, and you will smile at Elminster's charisma and wisdom as he lives amongst the elves of Myth Drannor. <br />It was wonderfully written, a beautiful piece. It dares challenge the belief that fantasy is all about escapism, alone earning it five stars. But, in addition to all of that, it is satisfying, fun, and pleasant. Well done. Buy this book, read it, enjoy it, and read it again.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-11

However, it lacked something in the telling that would make it great. It was as if the author didn't really want to reveal anything new about the world, and he was telling the story the way you would read it in a history book. It is useful if you run a campaign in the setting and need historical information on Elminster, but otherwise it isn't really a surprising story or a particularly well-told one. It's missing a certain joi de vivre to make it excellent. <br />On the other hand, it is necessary to read this to understand what is going on in Book 2 of the series, Elminster in Myth Drannor, which has everything that this book lacks. So, if you are interested in the sequel, definately read this. Just get it used and save yourself some money.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-11

I can understand why people liked it, but it just wasn't there for me. Rather like Lieutenant Data trying to play symphonies from Star Trek: The Next Generation, this book went through all of the motions, but it had no feeling behind it. Even catharsis isn't a good reason to read this book. <br />The protagonist is John Rain, a mixed-descent Japanese-American man who served in Viet Nam and was traumatized by the orders he recieved and the actions that he performed becomes a contract killer, with morals to boot. Then, he falls in love with the daughter of one of his targets. It's a common plot, and it isn't really carried off very well here. <br />His girlfriend is an interesting character, a jazz musician who seems like a character who could be much better explored. However, she never is. John finally lets his guard down at times, and a bit of character development occurs, but it is in all of the common directions with no real substance. Once again, no feelings behind the music. <br />A fairly typical assassin book, with an attempt to give it heart, which doesn't so much fail as it just never gets off the ground. The book carries all of the old motions but with none of the feelings. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone, because there are a lot more important things to read. It is a fun read, but it is ultimately disappointing upon the reflection stage, as there is no feeling of fullness or completion. The book just ends, no real sense of closure. I gave it three stars because it was endearing, despite its problems. But, I wouldn't, having read it, spend money on it again if I knew what it was. I may read it if I borrowed it from the library.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-06
US	40897880	R38XK2K89LO4XD	0553377868	735890843	The Flanders Panel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Wonderful Piece	I am quite pleased with this novel. It starts out with a rather intriguing question, Who took the knight? With such a lackadaisical beginning, Arturo Perez-Reverte begins a masterpiece of storytelling and intrigue. <br />But, before I continue with wonder and awe at the ability of the author to link 500-year apart events, let me make two technical notes. First, the translator was a breath of fresh air. I am hesistant to pick up novels by foreign authors, despite wonderful reviews, simply because the translations are often so sketchy. I don't know if it is the languages (Russian and German seem especially hard to understand), or if it is merely poor translation of phrases, but translated works often leave me wanting for more. Second, I have read all of the comments about understanding chess, and I think that they are a bit silly. Granted, you have to know what chess is and have an inquiring mind to care about the retroanalysis sections (which were fascinating, by the way), but you should have that kind of attitude toward learning anything new in a book, be it art history, archaeology, numismatics, or whatever the case may be. Just because it is chess doesn't mean that it is hard to understand.<br />Anyway, the technical parts aside, there was only one part of the book that I could have done without: The &quot;flashbacks&quot; (if such a term is accurate for memories that don't belong to any of the main characters) are interesting enough and are fun, but how real can they be? The Renaissance was a completely different time, and, like any different culture, is likely completely not understandable by us today. <br />But for that, I enjoyed the entire book, even the ending that is losing stars on other reviews. I believe that most of the people who criticize it don't understand it, but if you read carefully the comments of all of the characters (in the whole book; you can't start slacking toward the end), you will understand why the antagonist did what he/she did.<br />Enjoy this book. Buy it, rent it, I don't care, but enjoy it and think about all that it represents. Then, pass it along and discuss it with others. It is a treasure, far greater than the piece of art which it spends so much time discussing.<BR>Harkius	2003-07-02

Both his fiction and his non-fiction are worthwhile (which is fairly rare for an author), and his latest contribution is no exception. <br />Although it starts off a bit awkwardly with a summary of the anthrax attacks in Florida and New York in the fall of 2001, he quickly switches over to discussing smallpox. I can only assume that he wanted his readers to be familiar with how dangerous, exactly, a bioterrorism action could be. The thing is that it was really hard to make the jump into talking about smallpox when he had been discussing anthrax for twenty pages. Not only that, but there was a 30 year schism in the timeline. <br />Relatively quickly, though, Preston picked it up and gave a human face to smallpox sufferers, and explained, why we should destroy all of the working stocks of the disease and why it should be purposely removed from the planet. He makes a stellar case against the Iraqi weapons program as well, but some information in the book seems a bit questionable. Although it is true that most molecular biologists had heard of Jackson's mousepox experiment, and most people had heard of the weapons-grade nature of the anthrax used in the attack, I hadn't heard of how the anthrax had gotten that way. It was a dramatic moment in the story telling, but was it really necessary? Only time will tell.<br />It is a widely known fact that biological weapons are easy to make, but making that fact more widely known sometimes seems like a bad idea. Other than that, the book was excellent, intelligent, and provocative. Hopefully Bush will take a cue from it the way that Clinton did from The Cobra Event.<br />Buy it, read it, enjoy it. But, be careful with whom you share it.<BR>Harkius	2003-06-30
US	40897880	R3ICK46WBWMYJT	0609807986	395300413	The Jesus Mysteries: Was the "Original Jesus" a Pagan God?	Books	5	16	22	N	N	Illuminating	This is an excellent work, but it does have a few problems that I will touch on briefly. First, many of the footnotes are simply unnecessary. Instead, the footnotes should be cut by 75% or so and a simple bibliography attached. However, some of the footnotes are quite interesting, some are small historical notes that are important but didn't quite fit into the narrative thread. <br />Secondly, there is some justification to the statement that they repeatedly quoted Celsus. There was at least one occasion that they quoted the rabidly anti-Christian author when it wasn't really necessary, and they went a little extreme on quotes showing the lack of originality within Christianity. They aren't going to convince too many Christians, and simply repeating the argument is not going to work. <br />On the other hand, though, they did make a convinced believer out of me. Their thoery makes sense in the way that all good theories do. It makes sense of many disparate things, such as why Constantine chose Christianity for the religion to unite Rome, why the Romans accepted it and converted from their Pagan faith so easily, and why the New Testament authors spoke so harshly of Gnosticism. Their theory ties together numerous things that didn't make sense in a nice package that leads from prehistory up through our present day in a logical course that makes sense. I am truly impressed. It has been some time since I have seen such a cogent AND innovative argument. <br />There is one other problem, though. Arguing that Jesus never existed is futile and self-defeating. Many people will never accept that as being true, and it is simply unnecessary. It doesn't matter if Jesus existed or not, simply state your theory. Once, long ago, I am sure that there were humans that personified Attis, Mithras, Dionysus, Osiris, and the other Mystery men, if I may use the term so liberally. So, just accept his existence (as it really doesn't matter to the theory) and move on. <br />A great read. Buy it, read it, share it.<BR>Harkius	2003-06-30

Descriptions were nice, the plot was good (enough, at least) and the characters were engaging. However (isn't there always one of these), the story seems like it was dropped into a blender and left for ten minutes on frappe. The parts are mixed and matched, and, at one point a character being dead was all that told me WHEN what was happening occurred, it is a pain to tell where you are in the story. <br />If you want to do the pomo ideal and chop your story into pieces, fine. However, tell us which goes where sometime before we get halfway through the chapter. Otherwise, it makes me want to hurl the book across the room. This is the hardest Magic novel to finish with the exception of Dark Victory (which I didn't even make it through). Not worth the time.<br />Don't buy it, don't rent it.

The characters were more believable and had more individuality. The novel, in general, seemed better edited, less hasty, and more sure. The ending was not all that I'd hoped for, but I am interested in seeing what will finally become of Malik, after he gueststars in two different series. <br />Better than the other two, but is it worth reading all three? I would say no, unless you have a couple of days and twenty dollars to kill. A good book, though.<BR>Harkius	2003-06-24

However, Galaeron's shadow conflict is a little less ubiquitous, and it is far more interesting than the first, mainly since there is a little more at stake in this novel than there was. <br />The shadows are obviously gathering for the war between the Shadowvar and the rest of Faerun, and the Shadowvar will hopefully lose. They are a bunch of selfish, greedy &lt;Bad word&gt;s who really should be taught to function in the context of the rest of the realms. Someimes they remind me of the Colonial British. <br />Anyway, it was a  decent book, better than the first, and I am now working through the third apace.

Lovecraft	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Lovecraft Is Good, Notations are Disappointing	The stories are straight Lovecraft, with all of the pros and cons that drags with it. Good creepy fiction, some poor plots and some poor choices of wording. <br />The main problem that I had with this book though was the annotations. Almost every one of them was mediocre, some were truly bad, many were useless (especially the ones about names...only someone interested in genealogy would care, and they don't frequently use fiction as a source), and one that I saw foretold the ending in such a fashion as to destroy part of the ending. Hence, the annotations were rather poor. The illustrations were worse. There were two useful illustrations in the entire book. Other &quot;luminary&quot; illustrations are things like the pictures of three famous poets' graves. Why? The picture of Paul Revere's house. So? Etc. These occur throughout the book and are quite distracting as you expect them to matter, and are greatly disappointed. <br />My recommendation is to simply buy a normal version of these works. It is probably cheaper and definately more useful. The stories are decent (although I personally think that they are overrated), but the annotations are frequently annoying and almost always useless.<BR>Harkius	2003-06-20

For example, the love triangle between Vala, Galaeron, and Takari is dealt with more than is really necessary. More useful than all of the talk would be small, illustrative incidences where we could see how much each of the women love him. The shadow self is always dragged to the surface (understandably to an extent, since that is a major plot line, but still...) and his motives are constantly questioned. These are minorly annoying, but the real problem is that the book lacks anything of real substance. Its simply another romp through the FR, dealing with liches, phaerimm, and other monsters, and even Elminster makes a tired appearance. It seems odd to me that at one point Elminster, the greatest archwizard in the realms, has less magic memorized than Galaeron, who was kicked out of the Elvish Academy of Magic. Nevertheless, Elminster is a figure whom should either be a very tangential character or the center of the story. A bit player is not a good part for him, as it takes away from his mystique.<br />Not bad, just too fluffy for my liking. I hope the sequels are better.<br />Harkius	2003-06-19

I was told that Bodhipaksa was a bit harsher with meat-eaters than I found him to be, which was nice, since compassion is a major part of his faith. The Imaginary Tour through the meat-processing plants was interesting, and a bit grotesque, but that was the point. <br />My problems with the book were relatively minor, especially since the book is about Buddhism, rather than Vegetarianism per se. (Well, actually it is about why you should be a vegetarian if you are a Buddhist, but you get the picture.) Some of the issues involved were kind of silly, like \\"Did the Buddha eat meat?\\" Who cares? Really, it doesn't matter, and the philosophy itself says so, since there is a well-known passage that relates, \\"If you find the Buddha on the road, kill him.\\" What this intends to convey is the idea that it doesn't matter if the Buddha ate meat or not. You should think about what compassion tells you to do and do that, regardless. <br />Otherwise, it was a good book, and it was fairly interesting. The writing was a bit blue-collar for philosophy, but, c'est la vie. It was a good little piece of writing, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in vegetarianism and how it relates to Buddhism, or to anyone who is interested in either. Good, short read.<BR>Harkius	2003-06-19

It postulates some realistic science and some realistic sociology, but the ending just drags and the majority of the book is rather boring. I was especially unimpressed with Saul, who is a clinically depressed scientist. Granted, clinical depression is a bad thing and it makes everyday life more difficult, but Saul was an eminently despisable character, since he was such a whiner about his illness. It is one thing to be stricken with brain chemistry that you can't overcome, but it is another to take it out on your closest loved ones. Thousands of people are disadvantaged, but Saul is a baby about it.<br />Gratefully, Saul leaves the story rather early, and we are left with the love story between other characters, which is rather bland and uninspired. The plot is interesting, if lacking in the chutzpah to continue in the direction that it was headed, but can't carry the weak dialogue and slow pacing.<br />I wouldn't really recommend this book to too many people unless they are voracious readers and need something to kill some hours. It's not entirely bad (Stella's entrance is rather hideous, in a fun way), but it's not good enough to justify eight dollars.<BR>Harkius	2003-06-19

Elaine Pagels is one of the foremost authorities on the early church and a very good researcher, but if this book is a good example, she is not a terribly good author. For one thing, the book really doesn't talk about the origin of Satan. Rather, it discusses early Christian writers and their usage of the term and the idea. Which is all well and good, but it isn't really what either the back of the book nor the title really promise. There is also the problem of organization. While it makes sense to cover the Gospels in order of creation and then follow up with the Gnostic works, the intrachapter organization is frequently almost painful, as you easily get lost in trying to figure out what the point is of what she is currently discussing. There is a frequently used (and used well) literary device called signposts that should have been used in this book. Conclusions at the end of the chapters for some transition would also have been helpful.<br />The facts were all interesting, though, and I even learned a few things. The middle part of the book was exceptionally dull, but I was still able to work my way through it, and the end was pretty clear and concise. <br />All told, it wasn't the worst book I have read recently (Seal of Gaia by Marlin Maddoux gets that illustrious honor), but it wasn't the best either. Go ahead and read it if you are interested in the concepts of the early church writers on the topic of Satan and the possibilities of him controlling whomever the church was currently upset with, but otherwise don't bother. <BR>Harkius	2003-06-08

It had very common first-time author problems, such as pacing issues as well as the problem of not really knowing how to effectively write dialogue. Even when I was supposed to feel something in the dialogue, I didn't. I knew what I was supposed to feel, but I didn't feel it. In addition, there are problems that I have with the writing style. For example, the author shows a panoply of personal biases against anything liberal. Granted, legalization of drugs isn't necessarily a good idea, but that doesn't mean that all homosexuals or all liberals use them, which is implied by the story. All liberals don't agree with abortion, either, but that generalization is made too. It's all right to put things like that in and to let your voice show through, but the condemnation that the characters receive from the AUTHOR is rather harsh. In addition to that, the author cites, several times, the taxation of churches as being unconstitutional. I can only assume that he means the Separation Clause of the First Amendment, but it never guarantees the freedom of churches from taxation. Realistically, they should face property and income taxes like any other institution, and be held to the same laws requiring proof of tax exemption status. However, he is correct when he cites the banning of Christian television shows from being aired as being unconstitutional. <br />Another problem that I had was that characters would make revelations, completely without cause, simply to move the story along. An informant to give them that information may have been more plausible. With experience, the author may correct that problem.<br />One side note, I have read several Christian \\"End of The World\\" fiction pieces, and I think that it is quite humorous that all of them have a Democratic, Liberal president taking away the rights of the people, when the closest things in history to these activities were performed by Abraham Lincoln's signing of a law suspending posse comitatus, and President Bush's lovely \\"Patriot\\" Acts.<br />Anyway, the only other real problem with the story was one that is common to Christian fiction, and it comes from their viewpoint. In the end of the story, it is a foregone conclusion that all of the good characters are or will be Christians. I understand that they believe that God provides morals, but some morals are provided by society. I don't think that I would standby and allow my neighbors to be rounded up as terrorists for what they believed. No matter how much I disagree with what others believe, I refuse to take their right to believe it away.<br />If you have some free time and want to read an easy novel, pick it up, just get it cheap. You probably won't enjoy it too much.<BR>Harkius	2003-05-29

It was yet another example of Gaiman's failure to describe the physical characteristics of his characters.<br />The only really big problem (other than certain pacing issues in the book) was the conclusion. We spend the entire story hearing about the Storm and when it finally arrives, almost nothing happens. There needs to be more bloodshed, more conflict, more chaos, because Shadow spends MONTHS following Wednesday around. Really, at that point we expect some conclusions.<br />SPOILER<br />One other small problem I noticed was the conclusion of the affair with the old man in the town. I can't remember his name off hand, but he was the one who drove Shadow into town. This was an interesting plot line (although it came out of nowhere), and a child-murderer needs to be dealt with in a slightly more permanent fashion than this.<br />One of the most interesting parts of the novel, to me, at least, was the idea of Odin's sacrificing himself to himself. This is a common enough story in Pagan and Abrahamic mythologies (Jesus and Mithras both were sacrificed to themselves), and it was interesting to see that Gaiman really did his homework on the issue. He understood the anthropology and mythology behind it, and he managed to write a whole novel with it as the main subtheme.<br />END SPOILER<br />Other than the slowness, it was a pretty good book with a poor conclusion. I recommend it. Worth buying.<br />Harkius	2003-05-22

You stand warned.<br />The book started off well, and I think that Harry Harrison had a good premise...for a short story. Attempting to turn this plot into a whole novel, let alone a series of them, is somewhat foolish. The material just isn' t there for a whole series of books about Slippery Jim. The first book alone seemed to stretch over one hundred pages past where it should have. I can't, offhand, think of any particular place that it should have stopped, but after Jim met the Bishop and he got turned down, or after the Bishop was captured and freed, or even after they left Bit O' Heaven would all have been good stopping places with a slight rewrite to give a conclusion. Even at the end of the book the way it is, though, there is relatively little conclusion, and the reader is left dissatisfied.<br />Not a bad book, but probably not one you should pay full price for, either.<BR>Harkius	2003-05-22

Featuring the introduction of Steve, Jane, Hunter, The MC Governor Robot, and Wayne Nystrom, it starts a series about a chase through time involving six small robots, their obsessive and selfish creator, and a group of people attempting to keep the robots from detonating in nuclear-warhead like fashion. <br />The creator is a jerk, and he is an easily hatable villain, which is nice. However, some of the other characters are a bit thin. Chad, for example, was a paleontologist who butts heads with Steve for most of the book. This is a poor method of character development in a novel this short, and more thought needs to be given to it being a character development on the part of Steve throughout the series. He, Jane, and Wayne have that time, but Chad should have been a bit less antagonistic. <br />Another problem is that there are pacing issues. Sometimes the action moves along nicely and everything makes sense. Other times, the story seems disjointed and the characters seem to have some knowledge that they shouldn't, merely to keep it going.<br />It is an entertaining book with a modicum of good scientific data in it. Well worth reading, and worth purchasing, although it is geared more toward a younger audience, I think.<BR>Harkius	2003-05-13
US	40897880	R3QVL9BJOK1U59	0312958595	948962249	Fertile Ground	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A Great Book	Charles Wilson put together a great scientific thriller with information about epidemiology, medicine, and a little anthropology thrown in. The book starts off a little dull, but it picks up fast, and it is a great ride the whole way through. <br />I only really have two complaints about the book: First, yes, viruses can be transmitted by insects. They are commonly called arboviruses, and one of the world's foremost research labs on them is at Yale University. Secondly, Dr. Jefferies' actions are incredibly dumb. He really, really should have known better, and, though I understand he was in kind of a distressed mental state, I spent that part of the book cursing him and his stupidity. Even the eventual outcome of the mistake wasn't worth it, and no doctor would behave this way; putting thousands of lives at risk for one is careless, regardless of if it is your wife. <br />Other than that, though, the book was written very well. The divisions between scenes could be a little cleaner, with separate chapters for different characters, but that was a slight problem in the grand scheme of things. <br />So, if you like medical or scientific thrillers a la Dan Brown, Michael Crichton, Jeff Long, or Robin Cook, check this out. It is a repeatable read. <BR>Harkius	2003-05-07
US	40897880	RPM5NCOK7TVSF	0425163091	765103702	Chocolate Jesus	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Average Pomo Novel	This book was basically your average postmodern novel. The characters were the typical screwed up cast: The gambling addict and his neurotic brother who is obsessed with \\"solving America's Greatest Murder Mystery\\": Who killed JFK? The crazy old woman who runs her company with an iron fist and her spoiled son who believes that he is the inheritor of Machiavelli's wisdom, the Jewish Bookie who has decided that tortillas qualify as unleavened bread, and Reverend Domingo, the leader of the Church of the Returning Vegetarian Christ. <br />With a cast like this, I expected quite a bit more conflict. Sydney, who is Marty the gambler's brother, invents the Chocolate Jesus, and you'd think that it would hit the fan quite quickly. Instead, the main conflict of the story is between Marty and Dudes #1 and 2, Chaim Poplotnik's (the Jewish Bookie) enforcers, as they bludgeon each other. In addition to the lack of conflict, so much a requirement of postmodern fiction that Fight Club is basically only conflict, there are seemingly pointless ramblings about El Chupacubra or something quite like that, which appears to be a 600 year old rat or coyote or something that lives in the area and needlessly eats a poor hairless dog. <br />There were funny parts, but only if you are quite hostile to Christianity. This book makes a good portion of its (decent) humor at the hands of minor Christian cults. I thought those parts were funny.<br />Sadly enough, those were the most notable things about the book. It seems to lack direction, cohesion, and narrative ability. I was not terribly impressed by it, and I doubt that I will ever read it again. ...<BR>Harkius	2003-05-05
US	40897880	RCCD5L9GP1KIH	0964487349	116500264	The Dark Side of Christian History	Books	1	430	558	N	Y	Almost Worthless	Now, before you pass this off as some fundamentalist who hates the idea of the book, I am an atheist. I like reading about the atrocities of the church and pointing them out to others so that that kind of thing can't happen again. However, this book was almost purely bad, and its saving graces were quite few.<br />First off, the author readily admits that the facts are all in other places and can be accessed there. That is good to admit, but makes you wonder about the importance of the book. The quotation on the cover \\"This is simply a book that everyone must sit down and read.\\" is also misleading, as I think that very, very few people should spend their time on this.<br />She does acknowledge (like relatively few authors) that Constantine was a death-bed convert to Christianity, but she fails to clarify that he DIDN'T convert the empire, he merely made the faith a legal option. Justinian (I think) was the emperor who converted the empire finally.<br />She also gives importance to other \\"sins\\" of the church which are important: absolutism, the necessity of obedience and blind faith, racism, and sexism are all important and very negative consequences of some aspects of Christian faith, but few authors give credence to them.<br />That aside, the book was a waste of time. The author's fundamental premises included that the belief in only one God of one type leads to racism, sexism, and a formation of social hierarchies. I disagree vehemently, and posit that it is human nature that does that. She disagrees, stating that there were Neolithic societies which were entirely cooperative and in which there was no competition. I don't believe that this is true, but even if it is, her implied premise that Western thought is responsible for this is wrong. Eastern faiths all speak of the importance of humility and the lack of uniqueness of all people, which is to avoid the differentiation we try to achieve in the west.<br />Furthermore, the author devotes an entire chapter to expanding a foolish premise stated in the opening of the book, namely that the discoveries of Darwin and Newton supported the ideals of the church (inevitability of struggle and necessity of domination). She states that \\"Newtonian science seemed to confirm that the Earth was no more than the inevitable result of the mechanistic operation of inanimate components; it confirmed that the Earth lacked sanctity.\\" I don't know about you, but I don't think that the Christian faith has ever said that the Earth lacked sanctity; they believe it was specially created by God, and nothing could be more sacred.<br />What's worse, she later will claim that Darwinian evolution and Newtonian physics are limited and inaccurate. While both of these are technically true at times, neither is anywhere near as absolute as she would like you to believe. She begins to reference quantum mechanics and quantum physicists (plainly without understanding, as she misunderstands their work and their references), and she states that the world doesn't work like Newton thought that it did. Actually, it does, with the exception of the subatomic level, where Newtonian physics was NEVER thought to work, nor was it supposed to. She cites that science is unconfirmable, when it is with the exception of at the quantum level. She misunderstands the Uncertainty Principle, which is perfectly valid science, but is limited in its application. At one point, she even goes so far as to claim that subatomic particles have consciousness and make deterministic choices.<br />She did do some research in the field of anthropology, and she understands it much better, as she recognizes the importance of Mani and Mithra, two of the alternative Christs of the period. She doesn't reference them properly though, since Mani was a Gnostic. She also spells Manichaeism wrong, which is a rather odd error.<br />Speaking of which, the writing frequently seems pretty sketchy, like most of the chapters were introductions to individual books. Just when it tightens up and you are expecting some new information, the chapter ends and the cycle starts once more. In addition to this, Satan (discussed extensively in one of the later chapters, is NEVER capitalized by the author, and neither is the name of Earth. Earth is our planet, earth is dirt.<br />So, to recap: her theories are wrong, her grammar is bad, her science is worse. The book needs to have been edited with a more professional eye. I was initially curious why it wasn't published by Prometheus Books, but a little reading of the book more than answered that question. I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone, unless they already have a firm grasp of the principles that it discusses and a lot of time to waste.<br />Don't bother checking this one out from the library.

US	40897880	R3VIHPFP5SVSXO	0451192192	260699170	The Store	Books	2	2	4	N	Y	Not Little At His Best...	I was kind of disappointed in this novel. The first Bentley Little that I read was The Collection, a group of short stories by this Lovecraftian author. I was QUITE impressed by the collection with some of the stories being bizarre but fun, and others being creepy and ooky, and still others being scary and a little bit TOO believable (like The Washingtonians and Colony). Then I picked up The Association at a used bookstore. I wasn't too terribly disappointed (except for the ending, the novel was quite entertaining) and it was a good two dollar investment. <br />So, I went ahead and purchased The Store, thinking of all of the fun that Little could have with Wal-Mart combined with some satanic dictatorial CEO or living toys or something. I was quite disappointed. I don't know offhand which he wrote first, but I am surprised that the editors didn't point out to him that he had written the same story twice. This book (or The Association) is merely a rehash, the same plot, the same characters, the same evil villains (or at least close enough that they seem a bit alliterative), and in the end, you are left thinking that you read the same book twice. Of the two, Association was better.<br />Don't get me wrong, there are positive aspects. The complacent acceptance and participation in their own destruction and the destruction of their town is entertaining, in both novels. However, here is an example of the similarities: Both feature an adult married male protagonist who is not particularly religious, but stands by his convictions. Both are writers (one is a novelist I believe, a la The Shining by King, and the other is a technical writer working from home telecommuting). Both protagonists hate the Force of Evil in the book (The Store or the Homeowners Association). Both find few allies (although they do find a couple). Both have wives who are passive and relatively unimportant to the story. Both lose friends to the Force of Evil. Both confront the Force of Evil (which is headed up, both times, by an aged man who looks quite strange and whose most notable features are his eyes, which, coincidentally enough, are the only part of his face which look real). The Store does have a more nuclear-esque family for its protagonist, but that is likely only due to the nature of the book requiring that the man's family members work for The Store. In addition, both have an ending that is rather anti-climactic, and poor resolution. I can get past those things with enough story to support the rest of the book, or a justification for this, but it simply isn't here.<br />In short, I wasn't terribly impressed with this book. It isn't as good as The Collection, and it isn't even as good as The Association. I don't know if I will ever purchase another Little book (unless he puts out some more short stories - I LOVED those), but I won't buy another for quite some time at least.<br />If you feel the need to read it, or if you enjoy the way it sounds, or thought that The Association was worth another, similar story, pick it up. Otherwise, go ahead and rent it from the library for a rainy afternoon, just don't expect too much.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-26
US	40897880	R11TLXI0VMVSKE	0821601369	277037053	Pagan Christs	Books	2	22	26	N	N	Interesting, but Suboptimal	This book, while very thorough, is not terribly useful. The problem is that the book uses some seriously specious logic, along the lines of the argument that if something could be fake, than it is. Strangely enough, Appolonius is the only messiah-like character who is considered authentic by the author. However, there are more greivous problems even than this. For example, the author assumes that many of the teachings of Middle Eastern prophets and messiahs came from India originally. I don't personally know that he is wrong, but I am fairly sure that most people in the Middle East had little or no contact with people from India, especially since there existed, many years later, stories of men who existed solely on steam, people with beaks, etc. <br />The view of the author that Buddha was a messiah as well was interesting, but wrong. Buddha never claimed to be a messiah, he merely claimed that he had become enlightened. As far as I know, he never even claimed that his teachings were original. Buddhism is more centered on enlightenment, rather than on discovering the life of Buddha. <br />The author spends a significant amount of time tracing back the ideas of New World religions to Asian origins. However, his method (including calling a shared zodiac of four of twelve symbols \\"remarkable\\") was a bit disheartening. <br />Don't get me wrong, though. There are points in this book's favor. It is very informative, and it has quite a bit of anthropological data about God-making and myth-derivation. However, the book is still incredibly dense. It is only 170 pages, about what I read in an average sitting, and it took me several days to finish it. <br />I would definately recommend this to people searching for a discourse on alternate, mainly Pagan, prophets and religious leaders, but I don't know that I would recommend it to anyone past that.	2003-04-24

It examines both of these theories, explains them well, and even presents alternative theories and explains the proof for (or lack thereof) and against them. However, that does not mean that the book is without problems. <br />First of all, Dawkins has a tendency to wander off onto tangents that are only quasi-related to what he is talking about. The editor should have pounced on these and told him to elucidate further (his writing style and voice could have easily carried the book the extra twenty to fifty pages that these points would have taken), to include some footnotes for further reading (especially on points like the opinion that males and females in each species carry on a biological arms race against each other), or to simply take out these points which are of real interest, but not real discussion. They were poorly explored in some places. Secondly, Dawkins sometimes makes the subject matter more confusing than it really needs to be with excess terminology. It isn't really important to the average reader what the four types of taxonomists are called. We don't really need to know, and we don't really care. Yes, it is important to understand cladistics (and some information on the use of ribosomal DNA for cladistical purposes would have been quite appropriate, but is lacking), but the actual names of the groups, or even nicknames to help us keep them straight, are unnecessary. At other points, the reader can easily be bogged down in the various biological and genetic terms that the author uses. I don't actually know how great a problem this is (I have taken courses in genetics and biology at a local university), but it would seem that it may be slightly confusing to the average reader, which is his target audience.<br />Don't get me wrong. Dawkins writing style is great. I challenge anyone to read this and not be absolutely enthralled with his discussions of wandering through Biomorph Land that take place in Chapter 3. I have read that part of the book twice, and both times I was enraptured by his meanderings through an artificial land of artificial life forms. It is a classic in the field, and I am already planning who I will loan it to (most of my scientific friends) and the implications of the work. One last comment that I have runs toward the recommended items. Apparently, several people have recommended Darwin's Black Box, a classic by Michael Behe which challenges the idea of Darwinian evolution and presents a case more for creationism, instead of this book. I understand that some people probably cruise the site and make recommendations that are contradictory to the non-fiction books so that alternative viewpoints are read, and that is good, but I would, rather, prefer that people read both, and then make up their minds. <br />Definately a book which everyone should read once, and that people interested in theology or biology should purchase, and leave on their coffee table when friends are not eagerly borrowing it. Highly recommended, despite the missing star.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-19

However, I was a bit hesitant about this book, knowing that anytime a person strays from their field of expertise (think Shaq acting, Will Smith rapping, or Jennifer Love-Hewitt doing anything more than looking good), they tend to [be bad] at it (regardless of what it is), badly. Therefore, I waited to buy this for a very long time... I read the book, and was pleasantly surprised to find a wealth of Dilbert cartoons in it. The letters from readers are also interesting, especially since several of them are readers emailing him urban legends, with themselves as the protagonists! The only real down side was that there weren't enough Dogbert cartoons in the book, as he is a good consultant, dictator, etc. and happens to be my favorite character. <br />As far as the writing goes, it was humorous, and it was grammatically complete, so it wasn't very bad. I have read deeper works, quite surely, but this was a fun read for a good couple of hours. I have already begun loaning it out to friends, especially business majors. :)<br />Definately a buyer, and a multiple reader as well.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-15

First, he places far too much stress on the importance of a literal belief. This was probably the case when Christians were running the universities in our country, but it is not any longer. More and more liberal takes on the Bible are becoming common, and the importance of believing in contradictory accounts is less worth arguing now than it used to be. <br />Another place that I believe he goes wrong is the assumption that the proportion of soldiers in the Exodus Judiac population is equal to the proportion of ours. A more accurate case may be made to the number of American men who were soldiers in the Civil War. That, like the exodus, was about survival.<br />All told, his writing is a joy to read. He points out things that most people don't normally think about, and he makes a (to me at least) novel criticism of the dimensions of the ark and its ridiculous ventilation system. However, this is more of the type of book that I would rent from a library. It is fun to own and let friends read, but you will probably only read it once. It is a light read, though, and a fun criticism.<br />A reader, but a renter.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-11

This is how Chuck Palahniuk's latest deadpan novel begins, and it just gets odder from there. The story of one poor man's journey for self-worth, this book has some very enlightening and amusing moments, such as his description of the first pronography the sex-addicted main character ever sees. I can see the resemblance to Fight Club that other reviewers have noticed, and criticized, but those criticisms fall on deaf ears for me. The characters are very different, although they do share superficial similarities and their goals are the same. However, the generation that I am part of has a dearth of moral character anyway, and it seems that we, more than any other generation, need a reason to thrive, a reason to survive. This book describes a man in the same position as most of the men of any generation born after 1960. We wander aimlessly looking to give our lives some purpose. So, yes, it has similarities to his cult hit, but it has its own unique characteristics which make it enjoyable anyway.<br />I don't know whether to laugh at some parts of this, incredulous at the places you can get a good philosophical question to pose, or to laugh at it, reveling in the insanity that is vintage Palahniuk. In the middle of otherwise plebian circumstances, poor Victor contemplates his existence in the world, and tries to deny who he is. When he finally comes to term with who he is, the rug is pulled out from under him again, and he loses every shred of reality that he has acquired and must rebuild. This patient, relentless journey alone is enough to buy this book. The philosophical questions posed and the witty banter (internal, of course, since Denny and Victor seem rather...dim) make the book a treasure.<br />Don't read it. But if you do, don't expect to be saved. If you are, don't save anyone else. Above all else, don't lend this book!

Unlike the US biological weapons program, there is only one authoritative book on what the Soviets were up to during the Cold War, and this is it. I am fairly fond of this book, because it is factual and not exaggerated. <br />There are some problems with the book, though. First, Alibekov's writing style is a bit choppy. His \\"contributor\\" helped with this, but there are still sections where the transition from one point to another leaves you stumbling and rereading the end of the last paragraph. The other problem with the book is, from my point of view, the parts detailing what the Soviets did to hide their weapons programs from us. Granted, it is important information for the government and some people may be interested, but I wasn't. The entire section called \\"Secrets and Lies\\" is about this, and it was relatively boring, with the following exception: Alibekov's description of his realizing that the propaganda he was hearing is an interesting digression into the way people respond to state-supported lies, and his moral dilemmas are interesting.<br />All told, a good book and well worth buying, but not flawless, quite.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-06

Not because it reinforces my opinions or because it helps me defend or find my faith, but because it is so entertaining. Unfortuately, that was not really the intent. This book, like most by the esteemed Mr. McDowell is more a joke to an educated reader than anything else. In it, he presents Postmodernism as the biggest threat to Christianity ever. Bigger than Satan, bigger than Rome. It is the biggest threat ever. <br />He further goes on to contend that tolerance is not really what most of us consider it to be. Rather, it is intolerant not to believe his faith, because it is so obviously (to him at least) correct, and not accepting it is wrong. If you can read that with an open mind, you can see why this book is so entertaining. Like most of McDowell's recent work, this is mainly a collaborative effort, and I ended up wondering if he didn't really just allow his name to be put on it for recognition's sake. It is totally plausible that it is ghostwritten. However, I think that these are actually McDowell's opinions, because the same rhetoric stands out from this as does from The Evidence that Demands a Verdict with regards to postmodernism. From his redefinition of words with common meaning to his logical fallacies that cause you sto slap your head in wonder and bewilderment, this book is a farce, but an entertaining one.<br />At this point, I would like to quote South Park. There is an episode where a nameless teacher with a hand puppet (you all know who he is) engages in some outrageous and completely inappropriate behavior in order to get himself fired. At the very end of the episode, where he has broken every law of decency known to man, he rages at the audience telling them that liking something is acceptance and that putting up with something even though you don't like it is tolerance. You tolerate things that you don't like because it isn't your right to make decisions for other people.<br />In that vein, I can't decide that you shouldn't buy this book. Point of fact, I wouldn't decide that if I could. That is the behavior of people who are afraid of ideas, which leads to facism and fundamentalism. I would like to point out the importance, though, of thinking for yourself. The only reason that I gave this book a two instead of a one was the inestimable entertainment value I got from watching Josh McDowell point fingers and scream like some psychotic Islamic fundamentalist/terrorist. Granted, that is some powerful imagery, but I think that the author would understand why I use it.<br />Read the book, buy it or don't, just keep an open mind.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-05

That is akin to saying that any book with an Islamic fundamentalist who commits an act of terrorism is trashing all of the Moslems in the world. That is not true and it is a blatant misrepresentation. Rather, Swanwick needed to inject some conflict (other than the obvious in a book about time travel) into his novel, and (since evolution is a major theme) Christian fundamentalists seem like a good idea. I support this, because it is not, NOT, saying that all Christians are terrorists. I don't particularly like some of the followers of that faith, but even I would be against that assertion. Rather, he is saying that it is possible that misguided people may do anything. <br />As far as the book itself goes, it was disappointingly average. The plot was unoriginal, which isn't all bad, but the storytelling was less than inspired, which combines poorly. Instead, the author should have focused more on character development. We get to see some evolving in the characters, but we never really get to see why they change. They seem to make snap decisions out of the blue with no reason. Kind of disappointing. <br />One other note, slamming on Michael Chrichton's work, while not scientifically pure, is not the right way to go. He had a condescending tone for the author who basically started the genre of \\"Let's bring the dinosaurs back!\\" Have some respect. Please. Especially if you are going to advocate that using time travel is a good way to study dinosaurs. <br />Overall, a good book, but a loaner, not a buyer.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-02
US	40897880	RRUSGH15X91LQ	0385504209	315416156	The Da Vinci Code	Books	5	5	6	N	N	An Awesome Read	Okay, I can understand now why the other reviewer said that the story had been told before. However, I have two things to say to him: First, you should have marked your review Spoiler. Second, just because a story has been told before doesn't mean that there isn't something to be gained in a retelling. For example, John Milton's Paradise Lost is a reinterpreted and retold Genesis. Romeo and Juliet has been retold so many times that it is ridiculous. And yet, both are worthwhile. It is only part the story that is important. The more important thing is how the story is told.<br />Dan Brown tells a story that has been told before, yes. However, he tells it beautifully, and he is my favorite author. I have yet to read one of his books that disappointed me in the least. Each is Crichton-esque, but even more packed with research, care, and good story. I can't get enough of this guy's work.<br />Read this book. You won't regret it.<br />Harkius	2003-04-01

If you have to move, you will take the book with you. To the bathroom, to the breakfast table, even to your important meeting the next day.<br />Quite possibly one of the best of his generation's storytellers, Dan Brown weaves a fascinating tale of betrayal, military force, and scientific intrigue. All of his books are extremely well researched, combining the facts most of us desire with the what-if that most of us fear. A compelling storyteller with his head in the clouds and his feet on the ground, he is one of his generation's best.<br />This book doesn't fail to produce. I won't spoil the book for you, but trust me when I tell you not to think that you know what is going on until the end and you have put the book down. It is awesome!<br />A great read, and highly recommended.<br />Harkius	2003-04-01

Dan Brown can keep you clutching your book, well into the night, despite your better intentions to put it down. If you have to move, you will take the book with you. To the bathroom, to the breakfast table, even to your important meeting the next day. <BR>Quite possibly one of the best of his generation's storytellers, Dan Brown weaves a fascinating tale of betrayal, papal intrigue, and scientific terror. All of his books are extremely well researched, combining the facts most of us desire with the what-if that most of us fear. A compelling storyteller with his head in the clouds and his feet on the ground, he is one of his generation's best.<br />This was the first book by Dan Brown that I read, and it reinforced my belief that you can teach and entertain at the same time with fiction. Set against the backdrop of the Vatican and a Papal election, this book is the fascinating introduction of Robert Langdon, Brown's bookworm hero. <br />A Harvard symbologist, Langdon gets called in to help solve a mystery. Unfortunately, he gets caught up in it and it has some very good and very bad lasting results for him. He returns in Brown's latest book, The Da Vinci Code, which is incredible as well. I recommend all of Brown's books, because they are simply great.<br />Get this book.<BR>Harkius	2003-04-01
US	40897880	R3IBJKVA9L2QKH	0345461967	565690149	X-Men 2	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Surprisingly Good	Well, I don't know how this compares to the first X-Men movie novelization (because I was afraid to read it, after having seen the movie), but this one was written quite well. I can't say that I am terribly surprised by that fact, since it was written by the father of good X-Men stories, Chris Claremont, but I thought that the fact that it was supposed to be a movie would butcher it. However, I have my doubts that most of this will translate well over to the big screen. If the actors pull off the acting half as well as they should, Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen will both get Oscars. <br />The characters grew and developed, seemed real and were three-dimensional. I actually cared about them in this book, as opposed to the first movie where I had the ignomious urge to see Wolverine get hurt just to watch the wounds heal up. (When people watch your movie just for a gimmicky special effect, you should rethink your script). Hopefully Stryker is cast well, because his is a key role. John Malkovich might do a good job in the role. <br />Anyway, pick up the book, its good. Read it after the movie though, that way you will get the most from both. <br />Harkius	2003-03-21
US	40897880	R17CPQ0TY3BGU4	0380816032	263472515	The Big U	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Thoroughly Entertaining Trip to College	Although there was one facet of the book that I didn't like (the fact that you enter a Live Action Role-Playing game without warning and you feel like you have somehow become lost in another world, and desperately look for a way back to where you came from -- Don't worry, it clears itself up), this was an extremely entertaining postmodern romp through a college of dubious worth. The Big U is a college that is entirely self-contained within six square blocks, and houses some of the most believable anarchy and chaos since Greg Rucka's Batman - No Man's Land. Plus, you cannot beat the humor value of a prominent professor and the president of the college walking around a corner to the cafeteria, carrying guns, no less, only to run into a small, but heavily armored tank, that has been built by the local Geek Club. <br />I highly recommend this book, as it is entertaining, thought-provoking, and a schizophrenic romp through your own college days.<br />Harkius	2003-02-02

The case notes were frequently short enough that you would have no real interest in the case, and it read more like a How-To book for someone interested in writing a medico-legal thriller, as long as the person writing that just wanted a lot of really general information without actually knowing enough of what they are talking about. If you really want a good general interest forensics book, check out What The Corpse Revealed by Hugh Miller. In short, the book had a lot of information in it, but none of it was unavailable or more useful here than other sources.	2003-02-02
US	40897880	R3F4TFY7766LQO	0425187071	988325364	Plague	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Good, but Not Great	This was a decent enough book, but it was definitely not one of the best that I have ever read. The characterization was good and the characters evoked the feelings the author intended, but it was a trifle predictable and the villain (or antagonist if you prefer) used only common, widely-known agents. A doctor should have been able to be a little more creative, especially after noting several times how accessible the weapons are. So, as I said, worth reading, but its not going to be one of your frequent reads.	2002-12-17

I am a postmodernist. Deal. For those of you that are still reading, let me explain why this book is dangerous. First, McDowell's goal is one that I can wholeheartedly agree with. Students shooting each other is a situation that is unacceptable. Something needs to be done. This, unfortunately, is very much NOT it. The reason is very obvious, once you set aside your bias and consider what the author is trying to do. He is attempting to show you how to lead (i.e., coerce) your child/children back into a faith in God. <br />This very attempt to coerce your children back to God is wrong. No one should be forced to believe in Christianity or anything else, or we may as well reinstate the Crusades and the Inquisition. It will give you a good laugh if you take it the way that I can only assume that it is meant: as a joke. If you do what McDowell suggests, you will be forcing them to believe what you do and you will be sending them down a certain path to self-destruction. If you want your children to relate to you and to be healthy, teach them critical thinking skills and attempt to understand their lives and their decisions. They are their own human being and they CAN indeed make their own decisions. <br />It's a fun joke and I read it every once in a while to give me a fun laugh. Taking it seriously is a mistake. You do a good job, Josh. Keep the laughs coming!<BR>Harkius	2002-07-04
