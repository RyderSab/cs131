Essential reading for understanding species behavior and interaction.    Lorenz became active in the Green Party as an environmental advocate. For those interested primarily with his views on human ecology and civilization, a good follow up book to this is \\"Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins\\"(1974).	2005-02-28

Just like saying \\"The Last Tycoon\\" is better than \\"The Great Gatsby\\" or \\"Tender is the Night.\\" It is labored in parts,... and difficult perhaps for non-artists to grasp. <br /> <br />A knowledge and background in literary-cultural criticism and book reviewing is helpful.  Amis uses terminology and chains of thought which may not be immediately recognizable to some readers.  His protagonist's professional (=personal) angst arises from the critical notion that a bestselling author has a responsibility proportionate with her/his influence & status as a public figure. This standard could just well apply to film producers, directors & screenwriters; newspaper and magazine publishers, editors & columnists; tv and radio talk show hosts; politicians; judges; college administrators, etc. <br /> <br />F.R. Leavis, one of the influential founders of modern literary criticism, famously said that although we can't (objectively) judge literature, we are capable of judging life and for the practical purposes of discussion, they can be treated synonymously.  This standard applies even to the science fiction & science fantasy genre of creative writing.  So, the critic has broad license to venture out and comment on a wide array of issues; one who is wise and discerning can mold opinion now and again. <br /> <br />My hope is that Amis writes a sequel.  Like a modern Don Quixote, Richard Tull is more sympathetic than Richard III (I hope!) and deserves to be expanded upon.  What happens to him and 'The Little Magazine' in the new century, assuming Sebby didn't get to him. <br />	2005-01-07

Check out my Amazon Reviews from October 15th 2002.  As I noted earlier, reading Jonathan Weiner's book, 'The Next One Hundred Years: Shaping the Fate of Our Living Earth' before reading Gelbspan is valuable because it explains the history and science of global warming before introducing current policy issues; including the heavy obstructionism by the fossil fuels industry(oil & coal) and their public relations apparatus.  As Gelbspan notes, outside of the U.S. the existence of global warming is no longer debated.  The rest of the world has moved on to positive and meaningful steps to deal with the problem.  Quite very probably the most serious problem facing humanity in the 21st Century.	2004-07-23

The last two I recall finishing were John Grisham's 'The Firm' and Scott Turow's 'Pleading Guilty'.  Usually I just wait for the movie to come out.  <br />Kerr's specialty is, to be exact, the medical legal thriller.  As a medical malpractice lawyer, as well as a former war crimes journalist in The Hague and a supervisor of the first democratic municiple elections in the Serb Republic of Bosnia(Former Yugoslavia), he brings considerable knowledge and experience to his writing.  <br />His style of writing sometimes gets entangled in legal and medical lingo.  This is forgivable because of the completity of the subject at hand.  I wonder with the current conflict in the Middle East, that the Geneva Convention, first convened in 1949, is more relevant then ever.	2004-06-14

The heroine Stella, like a female Holden Caulfield perhaps, is a sharp observer, and posesses a quick satirical wit.  I want to compare her with Veronica, Winona Ryder's character in the film, 'Heathers'.  <br />With some exception, I believe, the best and most profound material from avant-garde women writers comes in their youth and twenties.  This is the best time for their incisive commentary on the condescending patriarchy overarching society to shine; as well as the attacks endured by the innocent(?) young female psyche by the previous generation of matriarchal authority.  In addition, she must deal with the predatory nature of her own peer groups.  My instinct is the primary reason for this clarity is when she get older, the benefits of modern feminism and PC doctrine become appealingly apparent.  To retain a rebellious outlook into early middle age contradicts the maternal instinct of community and family.	2004-05-05

Of John Fowles, Martin Amis wrote in 'The War Against Cliche' that he is a middlebrow writer who sometimes hopes he is a highbrow.  The difference is Fitzgerald wasn't equating second rate with middlebrow.<br />I wouldn't put Fowles in the same category as a writer but as an idea novelist he warrants some merit for creating this original and ambitious psychodrama.  Even when he employs artifice, Fowles is creative and imaginative.  His descriptions of the islands of Greece are impressive. <br />I recommend the hardcover Modern Library edition by Random House.  It contains the new 1998 author's Introduction.	2004-04-17

For in love, war, and banal & mundane but not always/often inconsequential small talk banter, a well turned cliche can be just the right phrase, whereas some highly evolved, original quasi-obscure Samuel Johnson or Oscar Wilde'esque proverb is more likely to furrow eyebrows and possibly evoke scorn. 'The Mezzanine' is Baker's first, a brief gimmick novel as the NYT Book Review puts it; captures the essence of everyday corporate life with stylistic flair.{Footnote: they consider 'Ulysses' the ultimate gimmick novel. Also: One of his other novels, 'Vox' became famous because Monica Lewinsky gave a copy to Bill Clinton.  She received 'Leaves of Grass' by Walt Whitman in return.}    The narrator, Howie, leads a tour of his world through the course of an afternoon. Through his eyes the trivial has seldom been so interesting and captivating. His piercing skills of observation are to be admired, testament to Baker himself. Howie playfully combines tidbits of wisdom and wit, the sums of which build and grow so by the conclusion of Chapter Fifteen it is difficult not to be subtly impressed. Baker teaches the reader to think like he does.	2003-05-31

I read the shortened version when it appeared in the Atlantic Monthly(July/August 2001). This work is almost assuredly more enjoyable to read through rose-tinted glasses. To read as intellectual satire, not puritan diatribe, is important for the following reasons.    1) The philosophical/psychological conundrum equivalent to how many camels can stand on the head of a needle is somewhat irrelevant to literary criticism. By this, the echo chambers of select English department graduate programs which fail to consider the broader reading environment.     2) Central to the role of literature is the ability of storytelling. Most if not all great/lasting literature enlightens and tells a good story.    3) Criticism and book reviewing can and should critique with reference to current social and cultural values, but life & literature are NOT the same, contrary to what F.R. Leavis expounded.    4) The critic as anti-philosopher.     Let me put forth the following working hypothesis: The typical literary critic/book reviewer is/was a failed or struggling novelist/poet.     Why not keep it relatively simple. Just state if you like something or not, process and explain what it is you like and why, regardless of style or genre. Conversely, passages which have a false ring, are clumsy, or excessively wordy or acrobatic, should be pointed out with comparative examples.     5) Writers who tend to win literary prizes, like politicians, usually garner consensus among the prize committees. It may be true that a quality writer, like a quality politician, is concerned with developing human potential. However, it is not necessary to collect prizes to tap human potential.    Along with Jonathan Franzen's famous April 1996 Harper's article, (he is the bestselling author of \\"The Corrections\\") included in \\"How to Be Alone: Essays\\", Myers' piece is a major development in recent years.	2002-11-24

This is the first book of his I have read where one of the main characters isn't a busom buddy or lover or former lover of some exhaltingly talented and ambitious MP or cabinet minister. The routine, even mundane middle-class existence represented chiefly by Joycean literature is often underappreciated. Joe's rational(?) narration is very everyman. The detailing of the balloon accident is exquisite and presents the role of fate and happen-chance in tragedy. ...  Also, the hypothetical argument presented on pages 170-171 alone makes this worth reading.    In my opinion this is the best McEwan novel I have read and one of the very best novels I've read that is set in the present day. Maybe the best. This is only my third 5 Star book.	2002-04-20

Fischer, like Tom Robbins{Still Life With Woodpecker, et al}, (and a semi obscure writer named J. Joyce) before him, uses unbridled imagination and hybridization as central vehicles to express his protagonist's vaguely normal existence in a sea of eccentricity.  <br />This book deserves considerable attention, if nothing else, for the author's choice of narrator, the wise and knowing urn.  For all it's whimsical satire, this novel presents deep sobering thoughts into contemporary society.	2002-04-20
US	49650825	RFC4B63CTGBJY	0385494246	654180128	Amsterdam: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Wickedly Rivetting	This novel is witty, keen, full of social nuance, and sharply crafted. McEwan offers on a platter the paradox of differentiating between <BR> <BR> CONDESCENTION IS THE HIGH PRICE OF ART & LIVE AND LET LIVE.<br />I wish he could have fleshed his characters out a bit more (by making the book longer perhaps), and the conclusion is straightforwardly Cynical. If its purpose was to leave a bad taste, the effect was right on. The concept of social Darwinism is alive and kicking.<br />Overall, a solid work of art.	2002-03-27
US	49650825	R13WT03H3LH4JY	0385497520	507343445	The Child in Time	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Powerful, Moving	\\"The Child in Time\\" is my first Ian McEwan work, although I was aware that he studied at Malcolm Bradbury's creative writing program at the University of East Anglia, as did Kazuo Ishiguro, of \\"The Remains of the Day\\" and \\"When We Were Orphans\\" fame.    McEwan is a subtly brilliant writer with amazing psychological understanding and insight.  With equal ease, he navigates the political landscapes of family; personal life; commercial London, and Thatcher's 1980's Whitehall.      The tribulations of his friend, publisher Charles Darke in the treehouse in rural Suffolk is altogether telling and allegorical in itself.  The stark tragedy of losing his child Kate, brings the neccesary focus needed to capture the reader's attention for the duration of the novel.    Heartfelt, and very well worth the read.	2002-03-14
US	49650825	RFY2TNONLKUBD	0375725059	408763793	The PowerBook	Books	4	3	4	N	N	CyberCentury Literature	&quot;The Powerbook&quot; is my first Jeanette Winterson book; which makes me unqualified to comment on her stylistic transformation from her 1985 debut, &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot;, to this, being her seventh and latest novel.<BR>   As a writer, I think her powers center around her descriptive abilities, both of fantastic and adventurous creation and the strength of this book, the Paris and Capri chapters; as well Spitalfields, and the George Mallory and Francesca &amp; Paolo stories. Here, the reader experiences through the bodily senses the joys of these wonderous locales.<BR>   Her writing is also intimate, tender, and personal.  I don't know if these are common adjectives which male book reviewers &amp; literary critics use to disparage female writers they don't particularly care for, but Winterson combines her up-close emational style with an array of big, intellectual ideas.<BR>   The result:  An insightful, original, sometimes funny and ironic piece of writing, but lacking the heavy satire and cramped, bleak nihilism that many women readers are not enamored by.<BR>   Conclusion: A book that could very easily make it to Oprah's Book Club but would prove anyone wrong who used that as a badge to discredit its marvelous contents.	2002-01-16

If you have trouble getting started on this lengthy book, start with &quot;The Sweet Smell of Psychosis&quot; his little novella.  <BR>   It is difficult to pin down what exactly is so provoking about this book.  Self creates a world, not quite science-fiction or science-fantasy but oblique enough that it allows him to weave his twisted but ultimately enlightening spells.  His satire is highly illuminating, extremely original, and altogether very funny in a 'noir' sort of way.  This book is definitely worth the effort of reading it in its entirety.	2002-01-03
US	49650825	RW6P0G5ALQ3W4	0743422910	769417678	The Constant Gardener	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Brave Cold World	When I turned the last page of Le Carre's latest novel, it occurred to me that it symbolized the dawn of a new millennium the way that Tom Wolfe's, \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\"(that journalistic presentation of a fictionalized circus)epitomized the eighties; and to a large extent how Martin Amis', \\"London Field's\\", in a more metaphysical tone heralded the future of the nineties and beyond.<br />Sandy, Alison, sir Bernard, Donohue, represent the careerist-minded oxbridge? establishment. The type, who comfortably nurtured, inculcated, and educated; and adequately(if not overly so) clever enough for everyone's good, could begin to sort out some of this planet's most obviously stickier problems.<br />I understand that the cocktail party circuit, to some extent, makes living in Washington D.C. bearable unless you can afford a penthouse in NYC and scoot up for the weekends. It is very easy to imagine any normally decent social climber with influence in the dualistic quandary of deciding between the ethical and the expediant, without making those careful calculations behind their eyelids as how many guest lists they might be written off of. Maybe we should commiserate with the Clintons', who successfully made the leap from Little Rock to the Georgetown/Upper East Side/Westchester County/Martha's Vineyard circles through much flack. Hurray for them.<br />\\"The Constant Gardener\\" speaks for itself. As with the two aforementioned novels by Amis and Wolfe, it is suggested necessary reading to understand our current political age.  Le Carre delivers a definitive update to the classic cold war spy story.	2001-12-09
US	49650825	R17N934TPG8AOJ	0671042742	364376928	The Honourable Schoolboy	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Honourable Spy	\\"The Honourable Schoolboy\\" is my first John Le Carre novel. It immediately brought to mind Graham Greene's, \\"The Quiet American\\" and the British miniseries, 'The Sandbaggers', by Yorkshire Television or Channel 4, starring a subdued and laconic Roy Marsden. No James Bond in sight!<br />Like another English novelist who I recall, John Fowles; Le Carre must certainly be forgiven for his occasional minor literary flaws for the fact that his overall observational skills and plot development are exceptional. I'm not a spy novel enthusiast, per se, but the lives of George Smiley, his Circus and Whitehall associates, the ambivalent Jerry Westerby, Liesa, Drake & Nelson Ko, Luke, ... are depicted in a way that makes the reader care about their fate. The climax in Hong Kong is exceptional.	2001-10-28
US	49650825	R33WPMN9O2TUJZ	0684830507	655275342	Tender Is the Night	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Tender Writing Indeed!	Tender is the Night is a somewhat lengthy, meandering sort of novel.  Its facination comes from this very obscurity; a tightly written mystery-murder(The Great Gatsby) it is not.  I highly recommend this book for its vivid portrayal of Diver's complexly layered relationships; with Nicole his wife, and with the budding starlet, Rosemary.<BR>     The author skillfully shuffles in the minor characters as well.  FitzGerald's observations about the psychology between women and men /Americans and Europeans is ultra keen.  His father's death, Abe North's death, his and Rosemary's quick but temporary liason, the fight with the Police in Rome, the illness of Mr. Warren, his parting with Franz and Kaethe, the antagonism between Baby and himself, the mental and emotional drain of Nicole's affliction, and his drinking...  portray the minor tragedies that constitute life. <BR>     FitzGerald tells his story to us better than any other 20th Century American writer could hope to, and in a lyrical style that keeps the reader spellbound.	2001-10-16
