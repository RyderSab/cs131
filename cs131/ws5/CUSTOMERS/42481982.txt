I can't believe how many people called this a \\"deep\\" read.  <br />Why are these two women friends?  They have nothing in common, don't relate well to one another and Clare, frankly, is a horrid person.  The only thing she wants out of life is, apparently, to possess Sally.  I mean, give me a break.  What was all that garbage about Clare feeling \\"betrayed\\" by what Sid does for a living?  IT DOESN'T AFFECT HER LIFE ONE BIT!  Yet she couldn't WAIT to tell Sally (and that whole \\"No, Daddy! No!\\" Sally screamed was ridiculous.  Granted, I don't approve of the kind of \\"torture\\" rags he was putting out, but that was over the top) and even worse, couldn't bear it that Sally already knew.  Pfft - there went her leverage to get Sally away from her family.  Yet she pushed and pushed to get Sally to stay away from her father, even encouraging Sally to not let her father \\"seduce\\" her.  And her to-his-face awfulness to Sid (not a great person either but he always tried to treat Clare well) and her threats about \\"I'm gonna tell\\" were self-serving, definitely NOT in Sally's best interests.  It served only Clare to have Sally separate from her family.<br />Then there is Clare's complete disrespect for Sally's marriage (and, contrarily, Sally's unsupportive reaction to Clare's first pregnancy - trying to convince her that she didn't want a baby, to abort it, put it up for adoption, anything but KEEP it).  Not only does she knock Sally's husband, Peter, to Sally's face (and for no good reason; fine, she doesn't approve of his \\"guru\\" ways but, again, she should just stay out of it as a) it doesn't affect her life and b) Sally is happy), but she is actually \\"dismayed\\" to see Sally pregnant again because it upsets her that Sally and Peter have \\"come together\\" again (i.e. she is upset by the thought of Sally having sex with her husband).<br />Again, someone tell me - WHY are these women friends?  All the \\"we know everything about each other\\" comments are also ludicrous.  These two women have only surface conversations.<br />A truly pointless and poorly written book.	2004-04-28
US	42481982	R2BMQKY1887VJC	0972601503	774499698	Buffalo Winged	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Cute, if a bit slow	This isn't a bad book, and hey - it's set in my town!  The only comment I will make is that, because the author overly saturates the novel with Buffalonian mentions, I think a reader who has never been to and knows nothing of Buffalo would get a little bored with all the restaurant/street/building references.  I mean, I live here and even I thought there was a bit of overkill on that end of things.  A book set in Chicago usually isn't overly indulgent on the landmark references, and I see no reason why a novel set in Buffalo should be any different.  While I doff my cap to the author's obvious fondness for this city, I really think she overdid it.	2004-03-02
US	42481982	R2UUMKZZZCNE7B	0373250487	212913475	Rescuing Rose (Red Dress Ink)	Books	2	7	12	N	N	Hum Drum	Okay, I have to say it.  There was not, contrary to the book jacket, any &quot;stalker who seems to know a lot about the mysterious circumstances of her birth&quot;.  That aspect of things was one of the reasons I bought this book - it seemed like there'd be an interesting twist, but noooo... there was no stalker, and certainly not one who knew her secrets.  I very much dislike when book jackets blatantly misrepresent the contents.<br />I have read both &quot;Tiffany Trott&quot; and &quot;Minty Malone&quot; and didn't find either very good nor very bad.  This book, however, just dragged on, and on, and on.  When I find myself skipping pages  I should know better and just put the book down.  But, no.  I plodded on.  I think the thing that bothered me the most about this book was Rose's unbelievable egotism.  Not to mention the twins' weird incestuous relationship (that really creeped me out).  And I found it absolutely bizarre that Bea, after only one date with Henry, expected accolades on Valentine's Day and actually introduced him to a crowd as her boyfriend when he had made it pretty clear that he wasn't.  Just strange.... as is the fact that Bev remained apparently unaware of Henry's - er - proclivities.  And what happened with the angry listener who blamed the break up of her marriage on Rose?  <br />As for Rose's orphaned status, that is one character who really felt sorry for herself.  After a while, I was like &quot;come on, now...&quot;  I mean, I can understand her frustration with not knowing, but her obsessive self-pity, mixed in with her ego, just grated after a while.<br />I won't even go into the relationship with Theo - bleh.  Not because of the age difference (though I personally feel that dating men younger than you isn't the best idea), but because he was such a bland, boring character.  AND there really wasn't enough interaction between Rose and Theo to make the reader want to see them get together.  Just my opinion.<br />And finally, could Wolffpossibly stop bringing her other characters into her books?  And she could possibly lay off the talking birds, as well.  All in all, just another fluff book with poorly fleshed out, unbelievable characters.	2004-02-27
US	42481982	R65I7AP99M52C	0373250207	854764484	Fishbowl	Books	2	1	1	N	N	One More Thing	I already reviewed this book, but I forgot to mention one other thing that made it implausible.  There is no way Jodine - a CANADIAN law student studying CANADIAN law would get a job at an AMERICAN law firm - she wouldn't be admitted to practice in America.  Heck - if you're a lawyer admitted to the New York bar and move to another state, if you've been practicing less than seven years, you will most likely have to take that state's bar!  Mylenowski needs to do her homework.	2004-02-06
US	42481982	RQDT7159R4PL2	0373250207	854764484	Fishbowl	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Good Bathtub Read - That's All	This was a cute, if not altogether well-written book.  I thought the plot line was a nice change of pace from the usual \\"I work in publishing, drink and smoke a lot, have crazy friends and am desperately searching for a man\\" formula, but still don't understand why, when it clearly WAS an accident, the book jacket describes the fire as \\"slightly accidental\\".  That made no sense (as Jodine would say).<br />I think my biggest problem with this book was the author's inability to give each of these women a distinct voice.  Allie, at some times (such as when she's observing Manny and Jodine cuddling on the couch) sounds a lot like Emma.  In turn, Emma often sounds like Jodine (and, as an aside, I know of no women who wear a size \\"0\\" yet have natural D cup breasts - that was a bit ridiculous).  I didn't understand why, in her own voice, Allie came off as capable, if somewhat naive, yet in the chapters described by the others, she comes off as some complete moron.  If Allie has \\"done everything but\\", why is she so freaked out about being a virgin?  It's not as though she's never had a man pay attention to her, so why the sweet innocent never-been-touched routine?<br />Further, I felt that the author went to extremes with some of the character's actions.  When Emma moves in, she promptly declares that she \\"has to s***\\" and then promptly removes herself to the main bathroom (when she is fully aware that she has her own bathroom) and leaves the door open?  Come on - who actually acts like that?  It just seemed so out of character for someone who is portrayed as ultimately feminine and sexy to do something so crass, just as the scene with Jodine snuggling with Manny on the couch with Allie in the room was inconsistent with her character.<br />All in all, a cute bath time read, but not one I would go around recommending.  I believe the author could do better.	2004-02-04
US	42481982	RZ95477167E5T	0452284554	111902659	Riding the Bus with My Sister: A True Life Journey	Books	3	15	25	N	N	Sorry, I don't believe it	While I will agree that Rachel Simon has a definite flair for prose, I have to say that I honestly could not buy into the notion that this book is a \\"memoir\\".  It may be based on a real person, but if that's the case, it seems highly fictionalized.  For one thing, I highly doubt that so many drivers-seat philosophers work for the same bus line (if, in fact, there are any at all).  It seemed ridiculous to me that so many of these drivers were able to spout off the true meaning of life answers that elude the rest of us mere mortals.  That is not to imply that bus drivers are by nature or profession uneducated or unable to think profoundly; I just found it a bit odd that so many of them had remarkably similary hard-life-but-I-found-the-light-and-that-is-why-I-have-all-the-answers points of view.  It would have seemed more realistic if just one (or possibly two) thought so deeply, but I laughed this \\"memoir\\" off as fiction the second the third \\"wise and learned\\" driver showed up.<br />Further, I found the character of Beth to be unbelievably obnoxious.  I read a review in which one person claims to know who Beth is and has ridden the bus with her.  If that is true (and, obviously, someone has ridden the bus with her), then I can  understand her frustration with Beth being portrayed as some sort of saint.  She's rude, plain and simple, and the author makes it clear that she certainly knows better.  If I were on my way to work and someone, disabled or not, started causing a ruckus, I would be one of those people who said something.  Heck, I would complain to the bus company.  No one has the right to behave that way and it chafed me throughout this book that Beth seemed to think it was okay for her to do whatever she pleased but that it wasn't all right for others to disagree with her behavior.<br />I found myself sympathizing mostly with those who hated having Beth on the bus.  I studied special education in college before switching majors and I have a definite sympathy for and patience with disabled individuals.  I do not, however, have any sympathy whatsoever for an able bodied individual who can and should be working to flat out refuse to do so.  Sorry, but if I suddenly decided not to work, I wouldn't get other taxpayers' money (darn - no self-determination here) and the book makes it crystal clear that Beth is able to work but won't.  A person like that is no hero - she's a drain on society and an insult to those who would love to be able to work and can't, and if Beth's social worker.<br />There are also a few editorial errors, but nothing that made me too ready to toss the book across the room.  For example, on the first page, Rachel is waking up in her sister's apartment in order to ride the bus - just this one time - for her article.  When she starts her year of riding, she comments that she has never slept there overnight.  Minor glitches such as that appear throughout the book.<br />Overall a well-written, but ultimately unbelievable book.	2004-01-22
US	42481982	R23MR6HAMTAEXL	0446691321	156214122	The Great Husband Hunt	Books	2	9	12	N	N	Dreck	Okay, maybe it's because I majored in English/Literature that I'm a bit more picky about what I read than the others who have reviewed this novel, but I have to ask - did we all read the same book?<br />To begin, both the title and book \\"blurb\\" were tremendously misleading.  The gist of both was that Poppy was a spunky, free-spirited girl trying to fight against the oppression of her mother's grand scheme to find her a husband.  Instead, this is the rather self-centered ramblings of a rather uninteresting woman.  Whoo - Poppy's an aviator?  Whoopie!  I'd have been more impressed if that part of the story was enlarged upon... what was it like for her, as a woman in the early 1920s, to take flight lessons, etc.?  In fact, I would have been more impressed, period, had the author actually told a story.  Instead, the reader is subjected to Poppy's constant \\"I'm so great, I'm so much better than everyone else is\\" bragging.  It got extremely tiresome and this book plodded on.<br />It seems to me that because the \\"book club guide\\" questions are often intelligent, they lend to certain books more credibility than they actually deserve.  This is one of those books.  While I am the first to admit that I found Graham's \\"Future Homemakers of America\\" sadly lacking in both plot, essence and skilled writing, I was willing to give this book a try (because of the aforementioned \\"blurb\\").  What a letdown.  In the author interview, Graham blatantly admits to having done \\"no research\\".  This, above all, is abundantly evident in this book.  For example, the sinking of the Titanic has been so deeply documented, I found it incredible that she managed to get her facts so screwed up.  Tell me please, Ms. Graham, how it would be possible for people on land (and particularly a newspaper) to be aware of the collision BEFORE the Carpathia was?  The comment from Poppy's aunt that the latest news is that there was a collision but the boat is being towed is ludicrous.  THEN the same aunt says thatthe news now is that the Carpathia has picked up the survivors.  Ummm... excuse me, Ms. Graham... it's not as though Titanic passengers had cell phones to call landside and give updates.  Further, as someone who has read MANY books on the Titanic, I am simply amazed that she thought this would fly.  Word of the Titanic disaster did not reach home until AFTER the Carpathia came along.  Somehow I don't think the Marconi operators were spending their time wiring newsrooms rather than sending the SOS.<br />Additionally, I found the blase nature of the characters' salon visits to be a bit progressive for the times... \\"cancel my manicure!\\".  In 1920?  Puhleeze!!!!  <br />There is also the superfluous characters whose introduction, indeed their mere mention, made no sense and who had no point to the book.  Cousin Addie?  What role did she play?  What role did Stassy play?  None whatsoever, so why bore the reader with more useless banalty?<br />Finally, Poppy's self-pitying whining about how her family always tried to run her life for her, etc. is nothing more than ridiculous.  It seems to me (or, in Poppy's words, I'm sure) that she was the person who went out of her way to abuse her family and ruin their lives.  Granted, her daughter's fixation on Gil was ridiculous, but Poppy's lies contributed to her state of mind.  Of course, Poppy's perfect, so why take the blame?<br />As for the ending, I found it woefully uncharacteristic of Poppy.  Suddenly the high-flying \\"I'm-so-much-younger-than-I-seem-and-I've-still-got-it\\" Poppy is content to live in Florida and eat early bird specials at a restaurant with a (gasp!) salad bar?  This from the person who shuddered when her grandchildren didn't chose a four-star restaurant?  Not likely.  Then again, neither are the chances of me buying another book by Laurie Graham.	2004-01-05
US	42481982	R2JHXIFF0KVMY6	0312310293	364025620	The Scheme for Full Employment: A Novel	Books	1	0	9	N	N	Beyond Bad	I could kick myself for buying this book!  It's so awful, I can't even get through it.  From the book blurb, it seemed as though the &quot;story&quot; (if you can call it that) was about a small group of men who are pulling the wool over their employers eyes.  Not so.  Instead, we're told (sort of) of &quot;The Scheme&quot; which, if you stop to think about it, really makes very little sense.  What is the point?  I mean, this company generates no revenue, so how is it able to employ so many people?  How can it really be considered a &quot;Scheme&quot; if everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) is aware of what's going on (the narrator points out that all of London envies &quot;The Scheme&quot; workers).  I just don't get it.  What is the POINT here?  I've never heard of Mills before, and certainly am not going to risk wasting another $14 on any of his other books.  This one is just awful.	2003-12-18
US	42481982	R2V5901HT6SG0	0060090367	962133592	Watermelon	Books	1	5	8	N	N	Giving up on Keyes	I have to admit to not being much of a Marian Keyes fan.  I hated \\"Lucy Sullivan\\" but did like \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" and thought I would give Keyes another try.  So I bought this book.  Over a week ago.  And still haven't finished it (not even close).  I just can't.  To begin with, I found Claire's sudden lust for Adam a bit untimely.  Having been through a sudden and very nasty breakup myself, and not having been able to function properly for months afterward, let alone even CONSIDER hooking up with someone else, I found it a bit of a stretch to believe that Claire would go from throwing things/temper tantrums, etc. to infatuation with her sister's friend in only one month.  Especially in light of Claire's supposed deep love for her husband.  Not only that, but that she made only one attempt to contact her husband during that time.  But what REALLY got to me was this line:  Claire has handed her daughter, Kate (1 month old) over to Adam and thinks to herself that, because Kate is in his arms, that she is one \\"lucky b***h.\\"  Who in their right minds would think anything of the sort about an infant... especially her own daughter?  I got to that point, closed the book, and walked away.<br />There were also some rather obvious editing errors (Claire carries on about how she is broke, then she goes to her bank - which is rather odd considering that she LIVES in England, yet her bank account is in Ireland?  Doesn't make sense.  Also, if she was broke, how was she able to get money from said bank?) that were somewhat grating, but would be overlooked in a better novel.  I realize this was Keyes' first book, but those \\"zippy\\" one liners made Claire seem crass rather than spunky or funny and I found Claire's supposed \\"zaniness\\" off kilter.  Her husband seemed such a stuffed shirt.  Why would he cheerfully bail her out without going ballistic about having to do so?  Basically, I was unable to get a feel for their relationship; it simply didn't make sense.  His departure is sudden and seemingly completely out of character and Claire's friends are all aware of the affair, but don't tell her (what kind of friends are they, anyway?)??????<br />I've pretty much lost any enthusiasm I might have had for these single-women/Brit Chix books, but I have definitely lost the very little respect I had for Ms. Keyes' writing abilities.	2003-01-27
US	42481982	R3BQ53ANAYM1E9	0140255125	472868610	The Woman Who Walked into Doors	Books	2	15	24	N	N	Well Written, But Ultimately Disappointing	I bought this book years ago... but didn't read it until recently.  Overall, I was very impressed with Roddy Doyle's writing style - and definitely impressed by his ability to write from a woman's perspective.  In fact, my only real complaint with this book is its utter lack of plot.  I was expecting a story of a woman who, though battered, pulled herself together and how she did it.  Instead, the book read: \\"I met Charlo, I married Charlo, Charlo hit me, I'm an alco.\\"  Great detail was given with respect to Paula's hiding of (and subsequent searches for) the key to the locked liquor shed, but this thread was not allowed to develop.  Nicola is aware of her mother's drinking, but nothing is said, nothing is done, nothing is faced.  If nothing was to come of Paula's repeated \\"alco\\" comments, I felt that Doyle shouldn't have bothered mentioning it.  In short, there is no resolution.  The story meanders from one tale of abuse to another until finally, \\"this is how I threw him out\\"...  So, despite the excellence of the writing, this novel fails because it simply has no storyline, character development, or resolution.  Does Paula just continue on in her miserable life, with nothing getting better?...  WHY, exactly, did John Paul leave (Doyle could have had a wonderful subplot with that, but just lets it fade)?  <br />Additionally, I got a bit irritated with the fact that Doyle repeated ENTIRE PARAGRAPHS over and over.  More than once I had the feeling that I had bought a defective book.  I kept checking to make sure that I actually had turned the page (i.e. \\"someone is in pain...\\" - that entire paragraph is repeated verbatim on the following page), and although I realize that it was done for emphasis, I failed to understand just what point, exactly, Doyle was trying to underscore...	2002-09-25
US	42481982	R33PY19OJOXVUW	0380820293	543757976	Last Chance Saloon	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Pleasantly Surprised	Having read \\"Lucy Sullivan\\" - and hating it - I was somewhat reluctant to pick up another Marian Keyes book.  However, reviews were so favorable for \\"Last Chance Saloon\\" I thought I would give Ms. Keyes another go.  Glad I did.  As a 31 year old single female, I could well relate to Tara's feelings of \\"fine, he's horrid, but he's my last chance\\"; because that was my own justification for having stayed with a complete jackass for as long as I did.  Believe it or not, my ex even pulled an Alasdair on me (the \\"I-want-you-back\\" one day and the \\"oh... forgot to tell you I met someone else\\" the next routine... devastating!)  I could definitely relate to Tara's pain... because I had experienced it myself.  Not only that, I even have a friend who's living with a \\"Thomas-type\\" who doesn't work yet feels her hard-earned money is his, acts like the world owes him something and constantly harps on her about her weight.  I couldn't believe how real these characters were; I've MET them!  Yes... Keyes really got it right this time.  Additionally, I have had the same best friend since the second grade, so the concept of friends having grown up together and remaining close was relatable.<br />As no one really expects to wind up single-with-no-prospects at nearly 32, I could also relate to the character of Katherine who, having been burned many, many times, has decided to just leave well enough alone and put her emotions on the shelf.  I'm sure there were few women reading this book who hadn't been burned at least once in the exact manner Katherine has by so many men (his frantic chase, his victory, his immediate loss of interest... woman dumped).   And regardless of what other reviewers have said about the women portrayed in these \\"Brit Chix\\" books... no matter how old, or how mature you are (or think you are), you never stop waiting for him to call the next day.<br />Fintan's illness was, of course, depressing, although I felt that Keyes handled his spiraling emotions well, and wasglad to see that, despite the fact that Fintan initially came off as the stereotypically requisite flamboyantly gay friend, he actually demonstrated depth.  Keyes portrayed his relationship with Sandro with sensitivity and tact.<br />The only down side to this book was that the O'Gradys came off as such hicks (c'mon... never having heard of an elevator?  That was a bit much), and I found the characters of Milo and Liv to be a superfluous and uninteresting diversion that the storyline easily could have done without.<br />Ahhh... and Lorcan.  Unfortunately, there are men out there like him (believe me, I've dated most of them!), though his blunt cruelty was spread a bit thick and I found his convenient brushes with the lives of each character a bit too pat and coincidental to be truly believable.  Nonetheless, Keyes tied his presence in well, and the scene between Lorcan and Joe at the commercial shoot was great.  <br />Oh... and Joe?  The only non-believable character of the plot.  Sorry, Ms. Keyes, but neither I nor any of my friends have ever encountered a guy that great.  He practically rolled over and fetched sticks for Katherine.<br />Overall, I was impressed with this book; I never expected to enjoy it as I did (I had bought it expecting a simple \\"beach read\\", no more, no less).  In fact, I might even read some other Keyes novels.  I just hope they're more like this than the horrid \\"Lucy Sullivan\\"!<br />As an aside... for all you women still searching for the stay-put lipstick, check out Yves Rocher's \\"True Color\\" line... stays like glue!	2002-06-14
US	42481982	R5JSAO85C1A73	0385720955	850910906	The Blind Assassin: A Novel	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Good, But Not Atwood's Best	I love Margaret Atwood (except for the occasional clunker she's come out with - a/k/a \\"Life Before Man\\", \\"Surfacing\\" and \\"Bodily Harm\\") and was very much looking forward to her latest.  And, up until the last chapter or so, she did not disappoint.  I was mesmerized (I even willingly read the story-within-a-story, and I loathe science fiction tales of any type) Unfortunately, though, it seems as though Atwood was writing on a deadline, or perhaps had run out of ideas.  Certainly, toward the end, the story became a bit muddled and, surprisingly, left many plot holes:... <br />Additionally, the language, which up to the book's climax, had been of sterling Atwood quality (\\"... can never stop howling\\") somehow becomes short and stilted.  \\"We were lovers, you see, in secret...\\"  When I got to that line, I had a very difficult time equating it with any other dialogue in the book.  It was too blunt, too sharp and failed to blend well with the rest of the writing (I thought of several other ways in which the author could have played that scene... definitely in a much gentler manner more in keeping with her prose)<br />And finally, the narrator's obsession with death and \\"being a skull\\", etc. was just a bit too much after a while.  Yes, we know she has health problems, we know she's elderly... but does the reader have to be beaten over the head with such blatant morbidity?<br />All in all, I felt a great deal of what was otherwise a wonderful story fell through the cracks and that much space was wasted on Alex's sci-fi tale (yes, I saw the correlations between the characters and the story; however, I felt that the Xenon story could easily have been cut by two-thirds and still have made a point).  In fact, it seemed as though the story-within-a-story was given precedence, and the rest just kind of fell in chunks around it.<br />Overall, I'm glad I read this book and certainly don't begrudge the bookstore its sticker price.  However, when compared to such greats as \\"Lady Oracle\\", \\"Cat's Eye\\" and \\"The Robber Bride\\", this was a definite disappointment.  I have come to expect a great deal from a Margaret Atwood tale, and this failed to live up to her reputation.	2002-06-06
US	42481982	R2O0OFUE0DR3TT	0743418174	780559593	Good in Bed	Books	3	9	15	N	N	Good Start - Fell Flat Towards The Middle	I agree with the other reviewers who stated that this book had an excellent beginning but that, toward the middle, fell flat on its [face] - right around the time Maxi makes an appearance.  Puh-leeeze!  I'm sorry, but regardless of the fact that I recognize this book for the work of fiction it is, it is completely beyond the realm of reality to even imagine that a popular starlet is going to randomly spill her guts to the first \\"human\\" reporter she meets, become her best friend, and lavish her with gifts - including a new home (incidentally, by that point, I thought Cannie had sold her screenplay and was rich in her own right - so where's the need for such charity?)  Oh - and as a side note, WHY do the main characters in just about every book I've read lately have to be some type of reporter/media-ite or, at the very least, work \\"in publishing\\"????????  How \\"original\\".<br />That being said, I really liked the premise of this story, with Bruce's articles, etc.  But, no, I didn't find his prose to be particularly sensitive - especially as it's well established at the beginning of the story that Cannie was comfortable with herself throughout their relationship, so where he got this \\"she hid in herself\\" take on things is beyond me.  Trust me, a woman who is hiding in herself and is ashamed of her weight does not eat french fries in public and initiate large, obvious displays of public affection.  Clearly he was embarrassed to be seen with her the whole time and used his article as some sort of catharsis in order to forgive his own shallowness. As for the pregnancy twist to the story, I liked it - it was not only a creative spin on an otherwise already-told tale (B. Jones, the utterly horrible Jemima J., etc.), it was realistic and believable, although, again, the post-partum meltdown was a bit much.  I found it unlikely, as well, that Bruce, who had (supposedly) loved Cannie so much, would completely ignore her letter announcing her pregnancy and that his new girlfriendwould not only have no qualms about being with a guy who not only got his ex up the pole and who willingly ignored her condition, but would then proceed to physically assault said pregnant ex (and she's a KINDERGARTEN teacher?????).  Huh????...	2002-04-04

However, one thing that really turned me off from giving this book four stars (which I would have, if only for the interesting twist of a murder mystery in addition to the typical meet-Mr.-right scenario)is Tansy's use of cocaine.  I really felt that Barr was glorifying drugs for at least a good portion of this book, and that is just offputting to me.<br />Other than that, there were a few editorial bloopers but nothing compared to those in, say, \\"Jemima J.\\" or \\"Bad Boy\\".  One thing I will say is that the identity of the murderer is disappointingly easy to figure out early on in the book.  Also, I wondered why Tansy didn't report to anyone the fact that the murderer was likely leaving behind items stolen from her.  Overall, a nice twist on the Bridget Jones-era copycats but still somewhat lacking in the fact that, though Tansy is from a different mold, she is still selfish and self-absorbed at the end of the story (she definitely still is not deserving of Max at all) and that brought the rating down to a three.	2002-01-29

Considering that Goldsmith is usually known for writing novels (i.e. books with actual plots), this was a far cry from her earlier ventures which I have enjoyed for the light fluff reading they are.  This, however, was nauseatingly predictable a la Harlequin, et al.  While not completely terrible, it was a far cry from Goldsmith's usual wit (see Young Wives as an example)and its characters were cardboard flat.  Tracie is hardly an exemplary young woman and Jon turns into a complete male slut.  I found it hard to believe that anyone who was initially that sweet and good could do such a 180-degree turn.  Very unlikely.<br />Additionally, who the heck edited this thing?  For instance:  on one page, it said Tracie stood up to leave.  On the very next page, about two paragraphs later, it says \\"they got up to leave\\".  At one point, Jon mentions how Tracie was there when he bought his condominium.  At the next, Tracie is griping about Jon's \\"exorbitant rent\\".  Etc. Etc.  The lack of fine tuning on this book is blatantly evident, which makes for a bad read.<br />One last thing, what kind of sexual ethics do these people have?  Jon has slept with several of Tracie's friends, yet this doesn't bother her in the least, nor does it bother her that her best friend may be getting ready to follow the same route with Phil, Tracie's ex.  And most disgusting of all, Jon sleeps with Allison and then goes straight to Tracie's bed... and she KNOWS he just crawled out of Allison's bed.  Of course, then again, she crawls right back into bed with Phil, so I guess they're all just one big happy sperm bank.  Disgusting.	2002-01-29
US	42481982	R1C6CUPCGNVQ1P	031227999X	279845342	Emotionally Weird: A Novel	Books	2	6	13	N	N	Even Being an English Major Doesn't Help...	Like many others, I, too, found the first part of this book tough going. In fact, I almost gave up on it completely. Fortunately, after about page 40, things start to pick up. But... I still don't understand exactly where Atkinson is going with this book. Like many others who have majored in English, I have had professors who attempted to force their interpretation of the \\"meaning\\" behind authors' words down helpless students' throats (fortunately, I finished school long ago and don't have to put up with that any longer). However, as I replied to one rather stubborn Lit. prof., who firmly stated that my differing interpretation of a book was \\"not what the author meant\\": \\"unless the author told you personally, you don't know for sure either.\\" That goes for me as well.<br />Therefore, I can offer only my own opinion on the one and only \\"hidden meaning\\" (if, indeed, there was one at all) I found within Atkinson's words: Effie consistently describes food as rancid, etc. All very negative, even repulsive, descriptions. Food can easily be associated with life... something for which these students seem to have a healthy disregard (see the complete lack of interest in Proteus' well-being as another example of this, as well as their own overindulgence and slovenly lifestyles). So, we have a group of selfish, self-indulgent, careless people. And so many of them!!!! While I did not have a problem keeping one character straight from another, I agree with those who felt there were completely too many \\"non-essential\\" characters in this novel. <br />Admittedly, many of the word plays are well spun, but others only grew pointless. For example, why is Watson Grant alternately Grant Watson? (note: I am not completely finished with this book, so I apologize if this becomes clearer in the end. Normally, I would finish a book before reviewing it but in this case I'm not sure the book is worth any more of my time). And all I can say about the many stories-within-stories is that they became daft after a while and I pretty much gave up on them. <br />Further, Atkinson's semi-dreamlike narrative seems to me, at least, an attempt to copy Margaret Atwood's lyrical style (okay... I'm a tremendous Atwood fan, and even she wrote some clunkers, so I'm trying to give Atkinson the benefit of the doubt and will assume that her other writing endeavors are better). If this is the case, she fails miserably; to me, it comes off as bored and lazy. I will admit, though, that Atkinson was a good judge of her readers' criticisms... well voiced, in that aspect, at least, by Nora. As soon as I thought it, Nora said it. Still, that doesn't save this book.<br />Additionally, we are to believe that Effie is narrating this tale to Nora. Why, then, is the story at times referred to as being \\"written down\\" and at others a \\"narrative\\"? Parts of the story are -by Effie's own admittance- fiction and others... are we to assume they're real? Or is it all imagined? As a side note, biological or not, I really can't imagine a young girl of 20 or 21 happily describing to her mother tales of her sex life and drug use... not to mention academic sloppiness - even if Nora IS a bit of a space cadet herself (and as a side note, if this tale is indeed being written down by Effie, why, then, would she stick with poorly-written, half-baked detective novels when she clearly has a better grasp on the English language than can be found in those pitiful lines?).<br />Finally... do we really need to read \\"my mother is not my mother... etc.\\" over and over to get the point? Quite frankly, Atkinson doesn't develop Effie enough as an individual for me to really care whether she was spawned under a cabbage leaf or dropped by a stork. Nora's history interests me even less which, to me, demonstrates Atkinson's ineptitude (at least as far as this novel is concerned). If the reader has no interest in the characters, why should she feel compelled to finish the book? It becomes very clear that Bob is more intelligent than Effie (my suspicion is that he downplays his intelligence to match that of Effie's - a person who is so academically unspectacular she is really in no place to judge Bob so harshly), as well as the better human being. In all, he's the only character I enjoyed reading about (and I am neither slouch nor druggie). As for the many other characters in Atkinson's little zoo... with the exception of Professor Cousins, who cares? They're all shallow, slovenly, mean spirited and trite. Again, however, I will assume that Atkinson has an agenda here. Unfortunately for her readers, however, I can't even begin to imagine what it is.	2002-01-17

However, as the pages turned, I soon became bored and, later on, completely underwhelmed.  Despite the fanfare, this book never really covers Tourette's Syndrome, its causes, etc.  Instead, the reader is treated to rather off-the-cuff (not to mention vaguely nauseating) descriptions of \\"eye-pops\\" and \\"croaks\\".  The characters themselves are completely one-dimensional and there is very little development there.  Though the book jacket describes Ms. Emily as Icy's only friend in a friendless town, her grandparents are actually too perfect and dote on Icy in a rather unrealistic fashion (remember, they know nothing of Tourette's - a typical adult would therefore assume, at least at first, that the child was merely acting out).  Basically, characters were either very good or very bad.  The teacher, unfamiliar with Icy-style behavior, is turned into an abusive dominatrix, while Ms. Emily, forever accepting, is something of a saint. When Icy is placed in the hospital, we see the exact same characters, this time, though, they are named Maizy and (forgot the nasty nurse's name, but you know the one).  <br />I agree completely with those who felt that Icy's spiritual awakening was far-fetched.  I can't imagine anyone in that book, especially considering the fact that her grandparents and Ms. Emily seemed to regard her with something resembling awe and fear, would force her to a tent revival.  Further, any teenager unwillingly dragged to any event will typically do anything possible to make her unhappiness at being there known.  Finally, the concept of a young teen who has not been brought up in a strict churching environment voluntarily (based on only an initial contact with religion via a rather dubious \\"revival\\") joining Bible studies, becoming a ferverent Christian, etc. is extraordinarily unlikely.<br />I was extremely perturbed when, after struggling to maintain even the slightest interest in Icy's \\"plight\\", I found the book and Icy's future summed up in two succinct pages.  How did she get into school?  How did she finally come across the necessary treatment?  What has she learned?  And, more importantly, how is the reader expected to believe that, at the age of 20 or 21, Icy is now a fully-qualified, self-aware, tender and understanding therapist?  Huh?  All in all, this book was a complete waste of my money ...and time.  ...	2001-12-05
US	42481982	R46TAS0ON8ETE	0802137008	910496991	Pure	Books	1	8	10	N	N	"Pure"ly Disgusting	If I were an English teenager, I would be furious at the way Ray has depicted a \\"typical\\" 14 year old.  <br />That being said, I, too, found it impressive (albeit a bit implausible) that Ray was only 16 when she wrote this book; that was one of the reasons I bought it in the first place.  What a disappointment.  For someone who reads as much as I do, it's rare to find a book that's harder to pick up than it is to put down.  Finally, I just skipped to the end, knowing that there was no point in reading the last 100 or so pages (repetition, repetition, repetition...) and thought \\"WHAT?!?\\".  There is absolutely no resolution to this book.  Then again, there is hardly any plot, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.  Ray seems to go strictly for the shock value of situations, none of which are pretty and most of which, I'm sure, are not issues with a \\"regular\\" teen.  From her descriptions, one would assume that the narrator's home life was one of depravity and squalor; as it was, it was simply a family struggling to get by on little money, with tempers stretched and tensions mounting.  This is typical and nothing indicitive of an abusive household.  What WAS indicitive of abuse was the fact that her parents willingly let her date a man more than twice her age.  Not only that, but a masochistic loser intent only on control.  This book is completely unrealistic and completely without merit. I believe that anyone who would consider this to be a \\"good book for teens\\" needs to take a closer look at what's going on throughout this novel (I use that term loosely)... I'll keep it short and sweet.  A 13/14 year old girl is engaging in:  oral sex on the grounds of her school; self-mutilation (for what purpose); masochistic sexual acts with an adult; drinking, drugs and violence.  Her morals are EXTREMELY loose and her friends questionable.  Her parents seem to care but let her run blithley along without consequence or discipline.  Does anyone really believe that this is status quo?  <br />Rebbecca Ray has a long, long, long way to go.  (...)	2001-11-08
US	42481982	R3R4K7TDLIOXRX	1551668394	66225134	Wedding Party	Books	2	46	52	N	N	A Bit Too Much	While I enjoyed Carr's wittiness, I felt that there was just too much going on in this book at once.  The insight into each character's life was enjoyable at first, but after a while I began to wonder what the point was.  The author begins to delve into Pam's life (Why, though... what, in the long run, does her romantic life bring to Charlene's wedding story?), only to leave her hanging for a while.  Then the story read like a hasty game of catch up.  This seemed the case also with Stephanie, Charlene's daughter, and her boyfriend, Grant.  Grant was given no character at all until the point where he decides to leave Stephanie.  Then we're bombarded with him.  I would have to say also that, though Carr defines each character's relationship with the others, their interactions seem forced.<br />Carr jumps back and forth between a myriad of characters yet they are never fully developed.  Instead, she gives to them all a &quot;everyone is happy now&quot; ending that just doesn't ring true.  In fact, much of this book rings false.  Dennis is - continuously - described as a rock, steady, trustworthy, etc.  But the second Charlene's back is turned he's after Agatha... and completely ignoring Charlene's hour of need.<br />Additionally, the book is repetitive.  We spend pages reading of Charlene's &quot;traumatic&quot; childhood in detail, only to have her daughter give a thoroughly parrot-like recap (of her mother's THOUGHTS) to her father later (and the long-lost-father story was too much - let's face it... after a certain period of time, people need to stop whining about their childhood woes and Charlene can't really use a ragabout father as an excuse for being even more self-absorbed than her daughter).  We are also told Merrie's life story several times (yet another character with no substantial purpose in the book; her story is convoluted and becomes even more difficult to track - Carr doesn't seem to know where she wants to go with it and it flies completely out of bounds).<br />I was very let down by this book; I had looked forward to reading it and to be honest I couldn't believe how much I disliked Charlene by the end of the book.  She not only does NOT get over her controlling nature, nor does she curb it; she uses it on someone else.  Truly I found her even more disgustingly self-absorbed than her daughter (why didn't Carr go into THAT aspect of things when discussing, quite unnecessarily, everyone's psyche?).<br />In all, for such a short book (I read it in one sitting) there were just too many characters and subplots at once (the stalking by Fred is completely erroneous here, as is Dennis' sister, Merrie, the woman with the goose, etc. and each lends precisely nothing to the plot which, according to all reviews and the book jacket, is supposed to be about Charlene).  For the  author to have thrown so much into so few pages served only to dilute the point she was trying to make (kind of like condensing &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;) and considering that no wedding actually gets planned, calling the book &quot;The Wedding Party&quot; is misleading.<br />Glad I only borrowed this one.	2001-11-06
US	42481982	R36KIXLLCYKFMJ	1575665867	22309935	Glass Houses	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Can You Say &quot;Trite&quot; and &quot;Unbelievably Predictable&quot;?	I have to admit it... I'm a book snob and normally don't sit around reading this type of (ahem) &quot;novel&quot;.  In fact, the only reason a Stella Cameron book found its way into my possession at all is because my mother left it behind after a visit.  I read it out of sheer boredom and within ten minutes could have told anyone interested enough to ask who, exactly, was tipping off the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  Needless to say, I wasn't surprised at the ending but the REASON for the actions of this mole was far-fetched, to say the least.<br />As for the characters themselves, I agree with everyone who referred to Olivia as a &quot;dishrag&quot;.  Give me a break!  Okay, let's see... someone breaks into her house, comes to her door, follows her, pushes a &quot;lookalike&quot; over a rail platform and the only recourse she can think of is asking advice from an e-mail stranger????  Somehow, I think at that point a normal person would be suspicious of all strangers (and probably half her friends... except she seems to have none) and would be seriously considering 911 (or the British equivalent).  And, yes, there was some extremely choppy writing.  I, too, noted the fact that Olivia mentioned that she was on the pill for reasons other than birth control (I don't remember her &quot;crying&quot; over it, though) and Aidan wondering what other possible reason there could be for taking the pill (here, Cameron is, apparently, subtly opining that all men are stupid).  The only reason for this conversation in the first place is, I assume, to indicate that yes, Olivia is a responsible woman but she's not some floozy who takes the pill just so she can sleep around.  Either way, she certainly finds her way into Aidan's bed quickly enough.  The rapidly building passion and its almost immediate dance between the sheets was odd... Olivia certainly didn't seem the type and Aidan, her protector, was someone you would think would have a bit more self-control.<br />This story flip-flops from locale to locale and the reader is left wondering what the point is.  And, if they were on the run, how did they get on a plane to England without the enemies catching on (didn't they have a heck of a time in airports at the start of their adventures?)?  Overall, this is a rather poorly written book that seems slapped together rather than well plotted.  I literally guffawed at the sudden appearance of Olivia's agent, or whatever she was, as a nemisis (again, a very shabby reason for behaving badly and why pick on Olivia, anyway?).  At that point the book went from merely bad to laughable.  I can't imagine seeking out any further Stella Cameron tomes... not even if they're left behind.	2001-10-03
US	42481982	R1PSPSJYZBL88E	1573227331	602052020	About a Boy	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Love That Marcus!!!!	While I agree with those who pointed out that this book tends to be a bit repetitive, this is still a very enjoyable book.  I adored Marcus' dimwittedness (although it seemed to me completely out of character for him to have thrown the bread at the duck in the first place) and felt genuine sympathy for him when his &quot;friends&quot; gave him the brush-off because he's too big of a geek to  hang out with even the other geeks.<br />Though it is, obviously, central to the plot, I was a bit confused by Will's logic in joining a single-parent support group in the first place.  Based on the fact that one single mother has dated (and dumped) him he decides he's hit upon the ultimate way to meet women?  Kind of a weak premise, there, but easily overlooked once the story gets rolling.  <br />One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is Hornby's ability to give the reader glimpses into both main characters' lives.  He doesn't focus on just one and we are able to glean an even clearer picture of the events as they unfold.  I was pleased to note that Horny didn't take the easy path and introduce a romance between Will and Marcus' mother (which would have been completely impossible to believe), though I would have liked to have seen a bit more character development in the mother and at least a rudimentary introduction into the life of Marcus' father (more than what we're shown, at least).<br />Actually, I would give this book 3 1/2 stars rather than three.  I gave it the lower rating because, while I genuinely enjoyed this book, it didn't leave me wanting more.  In other words, I don't feel in that big of a hurry to read it again (I've read Hornby's &quot;High Fidelity&quot; repeatedly and it hasn't been that long since I bought it) and I didn't feel at the end of the book as though I was saying goodbye to good friends.  Overall, though, a recommended read.	2001-09-27
US	42481982	R1UB2YY84VG7FV	0316777730	1192464	Naked	Books	3	5	20	N	N	Not Entirely Believable	First, let me say that, if pressed, I would give this book 3 1/2 stars (but definitely not 4) because it is well written and, at times, interesting.  However, while I enjoyed Sedaris' writing style and did, in fact, laugh out loud once or twice (the &quot;towel mystery&quot; cracked me up), I found the bookjacket comments that I would not be able to stop laughing, etc. to be more than a tad bit exaggerated (like these &quot;true&quot; stories themselves).  <br />I bought this book based on the fact that I had heard good things about &quot;Me Talk Pretty Some Day&quot; and wanted to read it.  However, I couldn't find it in the store, so I bought &quot;Naked&quot; instead.  Having read it, I have some questions.  Number one, who is this David Sedaris guy and what makes him so important that he would think he should publish his life story?  Two, why should we want to read his life story?  Three, how can anyone be expected to believe that these stories are &quot;actual events&quot;?  I find that extremely hard to swallow.  It would seem that Mr. Sedaris survived several attempted kidnapping/murders/rapes, etc. (without once learning the dangers of hitchhicking or relying too heavily on the &quot;kindness&quot; of strangers) by the time he was 20 years old or so, not to mention a myriad of other adventures.  Okay, I can believe it once, even... if I stretch my mind... twice; but after the THIRD attempt at his safety/virtue/peace of mind, it got a little hard to buy.  And, while I'm on the subject of completely unrealistic, I found it absolutely impossible to belive that - in the 1960s/early 70s, Mr. Sedaris a) not only lived in a co-ed dorm but actually shared a room with a female; b) that said female was a quadriplegic; and c) that the school actually expected him, a young man, to be responsible for the daily grooming/toilet activities, etc. of said young woman (since such institutions usually err on the side of caution I would imagine that the concept of a young paralyzed woman being bathed, etc. by a young healthy man [they wouldn't know whether he was gay or not] would be a bit suspect).  This, supposedly, is a &quot;true&quot; event.  However, even now, you would never encounter this scenario (even if it would happen, I find it hard to believe that the parents of a quadriplegic female would consent to it).<br />Also, I found nothing particulary endearing about his family and was hard pressed to figure out why I should be interested in their goings on.  I did enjoy the &quot;tic&quot; sequence and his mother's interactions with the teachers; I found the &quot;Ya-Ya&quot; sequence appalling.  Quite frankly, his entire family came off as self-important blowhards (and, yes, I ALSO &quot;believe&quot; his sister beat up a man who was beating a prostitute... completely realistic as well).  Sedaris focuses mainly on his sister, Lisa -to whom the book is dedicated; however, the reader never really learns anything about her.  All characters are painted one-dimensionally, something you wouldn't expect from a person who had grown up with them.<br />Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book more had it not been so prominently advertised with an &quot;all events are true&quot; disclaimer.  Quite frankly, I found it to be 99% exaggerated (that's the most polite way to phrase it) truth stretching.<br />Incidentally, as a matter of geography and fact, Sedaris mentions his yearly childhood trips to &quot;Western New York&quot; (Binghamton/Corning, according to him).  As a sidebar, I wanted to point out that Binghamton, New York is not &quot;Western New York&quot;.  The Buffalo area is Western New York (and there are hundreds of miles between the two).  Just wanted to clarify that because I can't stand when &quot;facts&quot; are wrongly stated in &quot;true&quot; books... regardless of how petty they are.<br />Anyway, I might venture a perusal of a borrowed copy of &quot;Me Talk Pretty Someday&quot; but think its more likely that my next &quot;autobiographical&quot; book will come from someone who actually has something to say or a point to make.  Sedaris comes off as a Lewis Grizzard (who always had something to say and a point to make) &quot;wanna-be&quot; and fails miserably in his attempt.	2001-09-26

Definitely not &quot;a masterpiece&quot;	I read this book a week ago and, while I enjoyed the general premise of the story, was quite disappointed. Simply put, there was just too much going on. Lamb could have easily left half the pages out and still come to the same conclusion. Toward the middle of the book I started to become very frustrated with the repetitiveness of the situations (i.e. Dominick going to one doctor: &quot;I want my brother out of Hatch!&quot;; Dominick going to another Doctor: &quot;I want my brother out of Hatch!&quot;, on and on ad infinitum). I found the ending more than a tad bit forced, at least on the &quot;new family, sudden wealth&quot; level (I could believe the Dessa part). And what about that character, Joy... now was THAT really necessary (the Thad situation, I mean)? I lost count of the times Dominick made a point of telling the reader that things were &quot;okay&quot; with Joy, but &quot;not great&quot;... it seemed as though just about every chapter for the first half of the book contained some sort of reference to the fact that they lived together, as well as a state of the union update (all told as though the reader was previously unaware of this particular situation). The main disappointment, however, was the grandfather's story. This was nothing more than mere filler and had next to nothing to do with anything else happening in the book. Granted it related to the characters in the sense that yes, he was a relative, but other than that it really had nothing to do with Thomas' condition, Dominick's failed marriage/relationship with Joy, Dominick's anger or his mother's partiality. It was just a story about a rotten man making penance and really had no place in the story at hand.  I'm giving this book three stars rather than two because of the fact that Thomas was beautifully written... his paranoia was believable, his dialogue sharp.  It's as though the reader is actually listening to him speak, can picture the expression on his face.<br />One more thing... what, exactly, is Lamb's obsession with MONKEYS all about?????????? Dominick is a &quot;little monkey&quot;; Dominico kills his brother's monkey; the little girl in the dance class wears a leotard printed with monkeys, etc. Not to mention Dominick's monkey dreams. ENOUGH WITH THE MONKEYS ALREADY!!!!! I majored in English/literature and even that didn't help me figure that one out. Overall, an unnecessarily lengthy book that by the middle has covered no new ground and through which the reader plods to find a disappointing end.	2001-09-24

I read this book twice because the first time I wasn't quite sure what I thought of it and thought I'd give it another go (a complete waste of time). The characters in this book are sooooo unrealistic I laughed out loud.  Karen, for instance.  Throws a dinner party and makes her roomies pay?  And they humbly agree?  Somehow, that doesn't wash, nor does her nazi-esque control of her &quot;friends&quot;.  Completely unrealistic.  A &quot;friend&quot; who carries on an affair with her co-worker's boyfriend?  And Gus... don't get me started.  I mean, how desperate is this woman, anyway?  Ditto Daniel.  As for Lucy herself, I found it very difficult to believe that she was compassionate enough to leave her &quot;fast track&quot; life in order to move in with her father.  And why introduce the &quot;depression&quot; edge of her personality if it wasn't somehow going to come into play?  Masochistic, perhaps... but depressed? <br />Oh... and the ending?  Riiiigggghhhhhttt... like we couldn't see THAT coming from the beginning.  Completely predictable... skip this unrealistic melodrama.<br />As an aside, though, I will admit that I was very amused by the characters' attitude about their place of employment. I'm sure a lot of us could relate to THAT, at least. : )	2001-09-21

Intellectual Genius	[....] Adrian Mole IS no normal 14 year old.  Adrian fancies himself to be an \\"intellectual\\", something he repeatedly belies in his fanciful, yet absolutely dumb, comments (such as \\"When Rembrandt painted the Sistine Chapel\\", etc.)  His language is purposely exaggerated to demonstrate his self-image.<br />That being said, I vaguely remember having read this in grade school; it wasn't until a leisurely browse through a discount book store that I chanced upon it again.  It seemed warmly familiar, so I bought it.  Since then, I read it whenever I feel like a humorous pick-me-up.  Adrian's language envelopes the reader and is, oddly, touching.  You can't say that you particularly LIKE Adrian all the time; yet somehow you find yourself cheering him on.  Adrian continually shows himself to be ignorant yet still manages to feel that he is intellectually superior to others.  Additionally, Adrian's self-absorption is juxtaposed perfectly with his \\"good samaritanship\\" (Bert Baxter, anyone?).  His parents are immoral, lazy, self-centered and just plain impossible, yet Adrian somehow soldiers on, alternately considering himself an object of pity and a shining example of excellence.  I'm looking forward to finding out how Adrian grew up (just found out that there's more books on him!).  In the meantime, I would recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor.	2001-09-07

I bought this book after seeing the movie and, I have to say, was actually disappointed. Very, very rarely do I find a movie to be better than the book it was based on but in this case I'll make an exception. The book starts with a bang but fizzles toward the end; it's nothing more than one &quot;hey, eluded them again&quot; chapter after another. Overall, it became repetitive and should have ended much sooner than it did.	2001-08-30

I would never make light of something as horrific as the Holocaust, nor would I presume to to minimize the plight of its victims. However, that being said, this book was not... repeat... NOT an account of the Holocaust. What it was, with my apologies to all those who praised this book while laboring under the impression that it would be unconscionable to do otherwise, is the diary of a teenager. And, to be candid, a rather conceited, spoiled teenager at that. I have to admit that, though I tried repeatedly, I have never been able to get completely through this book. Anne's considerable - and rather highhanded - opinions of herself get to be too much and it is clear that she finds herself to be superior to others. Simply said, I didn't find a warm personality in those pages.... and I can't chalk it up to the situation in the attic. Even in the first pages of the diary she compares herself with her friends and finds her friends lacking. That doesn't change.<br />Incidentally, if you want an accounting of the Holocaust, read &quot;Night&quot; by Elie Wiesel... a vastly superior book	2001-08-30

By the time I had reached the middle, enough was enough and I put it aside. Though I will admit to peeking at the end to find out &quot;whodunnit&quot;, I can't say I was particularly surprised at the outcome (seemed predictable to me; I had my suspicions of that character at the outset). What did bother me was the continual references to the occult, witchcraft, etc. Erzebet seemed to change from sweet to evil; but the characters in general were too flat to be bothered with. Overall, the narrative description was well-researched but, ultimately boring. I have no intention of finishing this book and wish I hadn't paid the money for it. A true example of not being able to judge a book by its cover.	2001-08-29

I'm starting to think that Maeve Binchy has only written one novel and that she merely changes the title. WHY is her opinion of men and marriage so skewered (especially taking into consideration the fact that she dedicates every book to her husband)???????? This book was, admittedly, one of Binchy's better efforts, but her continuing theme of &quot;girl-meets-boy-girl-marries/becomes involved with-boy-boy-cheats-on-girl-every-chance-he-gets-preferably-with-girl's-best-friend&quot; is tiresome and depressing (i.e. I have yet to read a Binchy novel where this ISN'T the substance of the plot... and I've read them all). I could see the end coming from miles away and, really, didn't think the protagonist deserved all that much of a pat on the back. The subplot of drug addiction (of a character barely acknowledged by the author) and Ria's desire to have her own business (her husband isn't stopping her... she's just too lazy) are mere page-filling fluff and the entire house swap is a little much. Overall, a nice bathtub/before bed read but nothing compelling or original.	2001-08-28

Binchy's books, as one reviewer pointed out, are either wonderful or horrible. This particular publication falls to the latter. The characters are plastic, the situations boring and the whole of Signora's background histrionic. The subsequent romance is forced and - once again - Binchy's male lead is an adulterer. Worth skipping. Instead, if you want a good Binchy novel, read Tara Road or The Glass Lake.	2001-08-28

I so enjoyed the first of the Bridget books that I eagerly plunked down the ... sticker price for the second (hard cover) edition, not wanting to wait for its paperback debut. What a waste. While the first book was chock full of quirks and oddities unlikely to challenge your typical \\"Singleton\\", there was still a lot in \\"Bridget Jones\\" to relate to. But... \\"Edge of Reason\\"? Initially I had given this sequal four stars; however, the next day I reread it and immediately changed my rating (must not have been paying much attention the first time... either that or I was still too busy chuckling over \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" to notice what drivel I was reading). African tribesman in modern suburbia? Accused drug smuggling? Thailand jails? Death threats? This book was truly beyond reason... in it we lost the \\"everyday\\" character that all over-30 singles can relate to. Instead we were \\"treated\\" to implausible, poorly strung-together, forced plotlines that completely overplayed the book's hand. The underlying romance with Mark Darcy is a farce... he tells Bridget that he loves her (and she, of course, is in raptures) yet manages to believe a conniving shrew over Bridget, mistrust her at every turn and eventually leave her with no option but... to leave. The staid, trustworthy Mark of the original installment would not jump to such ludicrous conclusions... and he would certainly be smart enough to see through Rebecca's acts of sabatoge. The re-introduction (though mercifully brief) of Daniel serves no real purpose to the novel, except to demonstrate Bridget's continual stupidity when it comes to men. Her mother, again, is over the top but, somehow, her antics aren't as interesting in this novel. Probably because somehow, Bridget is always on the outskirts of them... not actively participating in damage control, as she was in the first book. If you have somehow managed to avoid this book (and judging from the reviews out there, not many have - and yes, I realize I'm in the minority with this one), I would suggest - at best - only borrowing it from the library. Even in paperback, it's not worth it otherwise.	2001-08-28

I read this book years and years ago when I was about &quot;Linda&quot;'s age (I'm now 30) and it certainly hit home. In fact, I reread it a couple of years ago when I found it in a box of old books and the realism of Blume's fifth-grade world came flooding back. I was, unfortunately, one of the &quot;fat kids&quot; and, believe me, I received more than a bit of ridicule. And no, as is the case with Judy Blume's Wendy, those who inflicted the pain never got a &quot;comeuppance&quot; and, in fact, never seemed to think they had done wrong. Like &quot;Linda&quot;, I was punished for looking the wrong way, breathing the wrong way and for generally just being there. The characters in this book are, unfortunately, very true to life and, for those readers who are disappointed in the curse words, that, too, is realistic. I vividly remember my sixth-grade vocabulary (and offended parents who don't think their kid would use them, well... just remember back). Granted, the book's tortuous subject and the characters' subsequent actions are enough to make a person sick but it is real... kids can be cruel and the scars they leave behind deep. And, though I haven't seen this brought into play in other reviews, it is clear that the adults in this book do little more than passively encourage the abuse of &quot;Linda&quot;... as I recall from my own disinterested educators, this is also an unfortunate reality. All in all, Blume has written a very honest depiction of the elementary school jungle and should be commended for it... warts and all. This book should serve as a wake-up call to more sensitive readers (possibly the bullies themselves), as well as the parents whose children are on the receiving end. It's a frankly honest portrayal of pre-teen behavior (although I will agree that Jill's parents are shallow and more than a little unrealistic). I would like to say, though, that for the kids who today feel like a &quot;Linda&quot;... you have my sympathy but believe me, things canget better. Several years after graduating high school, I ran into one of my worst tormentors - who not only had gained about 100 lbs. and now found himself in my former position, but sheepishly apologized for his past behavior. It was just too bad for him that, by then, his opinion no longer mattered to me; but I've often wondered why he finally apologized. Maybe he had finally read this book.	2001-08-27

Imaginary conversations with imaginary friends, a heroine too stupid to recognize the signs of her own (second, no less) pregnancy (despite her husband's many attempts to tell her).  The strange, underwater quality of Frucht's writing was so odd it literally made me nauseous.  Yes, I understood the &quot;deeper aspects&quot; of the restless passing of time, life, experiences, moving on while the world seems at the same time to be standing still, etc.  However, Frucht's writing in general is abhorrent.  I also tried to read &quot;A Life Before Dying&quot; and felt the same way.  Frucht is certainly no Margaret Atwood, though I sensed that she was trying desperately to adopt Atwood's fluidity and grace with words.  She failed miserably.	2001-08-23

Nonetheless, I found this book to be delightful. Rowling has moved character development along very well (how refreshing to see Harry's friends finally get fed up with his neverending &quot;fame&quot;)and has left many avenues open for years 5-7 (did anyone else start wondering whether Dumbledore is everthing he says he is?). I did find the death of one character a bit gratuitous (he wasn't, despite all reports to the contrary, that big of a character to begin with) and the resurrection of Voldemort a bit too graphic for young children (heck, for me, even) but despite that this book had me wishing for the next installment (this from a person who read the first book only to prove that the &quot;hype&quot; was ridiculous and that these stories probably really were horrible).<br />I have to wonder, though, if this series can really sustain itself through seven years of Hogwarts (especially if we can't expect volume 5 for over a year)and Harry's teen years. Probably, though, Rowling can handle it. Oh... and for the sanctimonius ... who condemn these tales without reading them first, and who cry out for banishment (ever hear of a little story called &quot;Farenheit 451&quot;?) and book burnings, either get over yourselves or join the amish community... This book certainly does NOT promote evil (what do you think... that if it's read backwards a secret message will appear?). In fact, the students at Hogwarts are punished for using their magic for anything other than good and, for crying out loud, these books make no reference to devil worshipping, voodoo or anything of the sort. So I would suggest that you speak of things you know about and leave the conjecture to the students of Hogwarts.	2001-08-23

I read this book in one night, despite the tension headache caused by the author's continual alternation between first and third tense narration (she is, supposedly, trying to be a voice of reason in otherwise unreasonable situations). Jemima's weight loss schedule is completely farcical - although the narrator vehemently denies that Jemima is anorexic, no real person could keep such a regime and live. Additionally, Jemima's post-weight-loss lifestyle is so completely outrageous I found myself wanting to toss the book across the room. Her roommates' actions - both before and after - are unprovoked and plainly bitchy. If Jemima is such a slouch, why would they act with such jealousy? And Ben. Clearly by the end of the book Jemima still has unresolved issues. Sure, he loves her... when she's THIN (notice he wasn't too concerned with whether or not he wound up seeing her in LA... until he saw the &quot;new&quot; woman). Clearly this is the book's ultimate message... be thin, be loved. Oh... and the epilogue. At a &quot;size 10&quot;, Jemima is &quot;no longer thin&quot;. Uh... excuse me, but the last time I checked, size 10 is pretty darn good.<BR>The entire Brad/Jenny situation is laughable (incidentally, this was so obvious it wasn't even funny... you can see this coming from chapters away),if Brad truly loved her, he wouldn't care about appearances... and he certainly wouldn't be sharing his life with someone else. The whole situation refutes the book's supposed theme.... that love can exist regardless of looks. Notwithstanding that, the entire explanation for such deception is completely contrived. You mean to tell me the author could come up with no better excuse for Brad's behavior than THAT?????<BR>Overall, an okay read if you are able to completely suspend reality (fiction or not, I prefer my books to be grounded in some sort of normality). Otherwise, skip it.	2001-08-22

Unfortunately, as the story progressed, it soon turned into yet another literary clone (I did like this book the first time I read it... when it was titled &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot;).  This story, however, is merely a knock off.  The &quot;leading man&quot; is nothing more than a Mark Darcy clone (handsome, rich, successful, at first scornful, then loving, etc.) and the supporting cast flighty (if not altogether unnecessary... what WAS the point of her roommate's second cousin... who shows up in one scene, says nothing, and is never mentioned again?) Although I enjoyed the neurosis of the shopping stories and especially Becky's humorous attempt at secondary employment, the ending, proved to be disappointingly formulatic and tremendously unrealistic, with the ensuing romance seeming unlikely and forced.  Overall, a very disappointing book.	2001-08-21

Once again, as with 99% of Bridget Jones clones, this book pales in comparison.  The ending is sloppily tied together and completely unrealistic, and the characters completely flat.  Does anyone really care about Melanie's roommate, or - for that matter - Amanda?  If Melanie and Fran are too &quot;lower class&quot; for her, why would Amanda even bother and, not to spoil the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, but Amanda's sudden behavior toward Melanie at the wedding comes off as completely ridiculous.  Overall - don't waste the money.	2001-08-20

I found it disconcerting that the author couldn't find it in her to develop new characters and used her own name, occupation, habits and quirks, as well as those of her parents.  The ending suggests an slightly fictionalized autobiography; in which case this book is a rather unimaginative tale of &quot;woe is me.&quot;  Definitely not a lighthearted read.  I, too, would suggest the library version.  Not something to read over and over.	2001-08-20

One of the worst books I've ever read	This was one of the most poorly developed and weakly written books I have ever read.  I still can't believe I wasted money on it.  Unrealistic characters, non-existent plot, shallow, undefined main character, for whom the reader is, supposedly, to feel some sort of sympathy (she's sexually dissatisfied, men treat her badly, etc.). She speaks frequently of writing in her journal; yet the reader isn't allowed to read any of it, which makes it nothing more than a thin veil for a shallow, neurotic, lazy persona.  The reader never learns how she really feels, let alone whether or not her desire to be a writer is even realistic.  Overall, it seems as though her main goal in life is to find a rich man to sponge off of.  As for the other characters, Cassandra, her husband, and her miserable, perverted son are too extreme to be realistic, as are some of the more ridiculous situations they get into.  There is simply no point in discussing the &quot;professional nannies&quot; and their mercenary itineraries.  This book is not even worth getting from the library.  A complete waste of time.	2001-08-20

I did, however, find the domestic abuse situation a bit too graphically described and the ending a bit pat (once again, a la Bridget Jones). I had to laugh out loud at some of Helen's bitchier comments but found her animosity toward Marcus to be a bit unrealistic. She KNEW what he was like, so why all the hoopla over their brief, three-minute &quot;affair&quot;? Additionally, her behavior toward her friends is both hideously immature and unforgivable after a while. Helen's only saving grace from being a rather unlikable person is, in fact, her own human foibles. Had she not been so prone to embarrassing instances herself, I would have wanted to slap her. Toward the end, though, we see Helen starting to grow up a bit. She's not completely there, but at least she is making the effort to put the feelings of others into perspective and to &quot;get over&quot; her own me-me-me-me attitude. Maxted portrays this well and, having been in the same situation as Helen, I can honestly say that Maxted's portrayl of a woman confused over her sense of loss when her father - to whom she was &quot;not close&quot; - dies and her friends' subsequent confusion over her reaction is well written and very realistic. While not succumbing to complete sappiness, Maxted portrays Helen's loss well.<BR>Definitely a book worth reading.	2001-08-20
