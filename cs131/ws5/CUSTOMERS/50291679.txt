Smitten's book is an excellent biography of Jesse Livermore with many details/stories that cannot be read in \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\". It gives a fantastic insight into JL's business, and more important, private life. While this biography covers some of JL's trading strategies, it goes more in other details of JL's exciting life. I still believe the \\"Reminiscences of a ...\\" is essential reading in understanding JL's trading life. The biography can never (and maybe should not) get into the trading thinking of JL. Whoever is deeply intereted in JL should read \\"Reminiscences of a ..\\" first, and than the biography. The reader will have a much bigger picture on JL (and will re-read both books several times)	2005-08-09

It's philosophy of approaching negotiation is unmatched. But once you have the big picture/philosophy you need more tools to digg deep into the negotiation strategies and tactics. That's when \\"Everything is Negotiable\\" comes into play. This book is a blast. With 26 chapters and tuns of \\"real life\\" examples, the author explores a wide range of negotiation situation. Very thought stimulating are also all the self-assesments to each chapter. I strongly believe that this books can help the novice as wells as the advanced negotiator in honing their skills in negotiation. If there is one weakness, than it's the rather \\"simple\\" cases of negotiation examples, in particular on prices. The book highly focuses on negotiating prices while it neglects to a certain degree complicated neogiations that involve less quantifiable outcomes. Nevertheless, if negotiation on price is your first aim, than that's the book for you. Five stars for such an alloborate work on an almost every day topice.	2004-12-19

First, the book does not cover creative thinking, or creative greatness. You better look for other great books on building creative thinking like \\"Cracking Creativity\\". Second, every page confirms the writer's background of a lawyer. While thinking, especially the unthinkable is undeniably very important in the court, the writer is kind of trapped in a \\"black/white\\" world. True vs. lie with topics such as \\"concentrate on crucial facts\\" or \\"always make sure..\\". Well, that might work in the court, but helps one little in thinking out of the box / thinking creatively. Thus, worst rating possible.	2004-12-19

It's 100% a book for the beginner and semi-pro in the world of structuring/selling/using equity derivatives.

It's definitely the best  book on the subject apart from Neftci's &quot;An Introduction to the  Mathematics of Financial Derivatives&quot;. Baxter and Rennie spend more  time on probabilities than Neftci. One word on introductionary books on the  mathematics of derivatives. Introductionary is meant for people who have a  strong mathematical / quantitative background. For all the others, a book  like &quot;Quantitative Methods in Finance&quot; might be a better book to  start with.	2000-09-03

MBA book, Ward provides the student and professional  alike with an excellent introduction to finance in a strategic context. In  Part 1, he starts off with the basics including a review of theories of  finance. Part 2 is probably the most interesting one. Ward goes through the  four stages of a company and its financial strategy (start-up, growth  company, mature company, declining business). Part 3 covers the important  role of dynamic growth. Part 4 considers the impact of the opposite types  of strategies which are involved in consolidating or refocusing the  business. Part 5 offers an interesting and unique look at financial  strategy from the perspective of the externally based, professional  financial adviser (e.g. Investment Banker or Consultant).	2000-09-03

The real  cases are exciting. The topics are very broad and ranging from cash  budgeting to financial risk management. Most of the cases are supported  with good background material like charts and income statements. The book  is excellent for class discussions, but not for the ambituous reader who  wants to teach himself corporate finance.

Derivatives pushed me to study the mathematics of  derivatives. Calculus Made Easy is especially good for people who need the  &quot;big picture&quot;. People who want to &quot;understand&quot; calculus  to the extend as to applying the principles of calculus. The book is  fantastic, but you must be mathematical eager and know some algebra. Many  other books on calculus go too far. Are too broad for the reader who wants  to get the basics in an concise way. This book gives you in over 300 pages  the &quot;big picture&quot; and certainly a great foundation for further  studies.	2000-09-02

I am sure the book can be of help to  the novice as for the expert speaker alike.

There's only one point: Frank remarks that a salesman doesn't  have to understand Hull's book to be successful. Well, I disagree.

The book is  neately structured with a great conclusion at every chapter. Quantitative  support is used only where necessary and therefore kept to a minimum.

This is the book for practitioners and students alike. To me, it was very refreshing reading a book which is  &quot;down to earth&quot; but still captures the &quot;essence&quot; of  quantitative finance. Where else can you find Taylors series applied to  estimate bond price changes step by step? Some stuff is pretty basic, but  the authors manage to cover advance quite rapidly (e.g. cointegration,  GARCH, optimization). Nefti's book on derivatives is very difficult for non  math guys (if not impossible), but Wilmott's isn't much easier either.	2000-08-16

It's a great pleasure to read his book. Not only does he cover a vast range of topics (50 chapters), but he also presents it with loads of  examples. Paul's addition of Excel Visual Basic formulas plus the wide  range of references make it the book on financial engineering. It's very  rare to find people who can explain such a technical topic in such a  individualistic style (reminds me of Richard Feynmann who explained quantum  theory without maths).<br />It's still very technical though, be reminded that  Paul is a mathematician, so readers who are looking for a non math book on  derivatives are well advised to look for another book (e.g. Kolb).	2000-07-31

By analysing the acquisition premium  with his Required Performance Improvement (RPI) formula, Dr. Sirower shows  how to determine in advance when the price is far above the potential value  of an acquisition. The way managers who analyse the acquisition premium and  concept of synergy can avoid to get caught and how to predict the  probability of shareholder losses or gains (although the probability  formula is not flawless). Regardless the good work done by Dr. Sirower, I  wouldn't be surprised if M&amp;A professionals don't like the book because  of its highly critical approach to synergie effects.	2000-05-28
