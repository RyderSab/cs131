Like Mailer, Fuller made use of his experience with the subject to create a work that's gritty, provocative and rewarding. This covers the length and breadth of the war against Germany, but its focus on a small group of soldiers makes it hit home. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-08-24

The pairing definitely gives the series a spark, all without sacrificing any of the trademark wit or cleverness. Kaminsky's series is filled with interesting characters and this one is no exception; magician Harry Blackstone is the featured celebrity and he is put to good use. And, as always, Kaminsky makes excellent use of Los Angeles in the 1940s. <br />	2005-01-18

Murolo & Chitty clearly know the material and approach it from a strongly held left-of-center point of view. Their book covers centuries and contains a treasure trove of information - as well as some wonderful illustrations by Joe Sacco. It also probably contains more different acronyms than any book I've ever read (complete with a six-page list of them).  <br /> <br />The book suffers from the fate of many general histories - it covers a lot of ground without much variety to make for more flavorful reading. It doesn't help that the authors keep insisting on reminding us that women and minorities quite often have gotten the short end of the stick; that is a recurring theme that is pounded into the ground. <br />	2004-12-29

Roth's books often seem to explore the nature of truth and fiction, and this book, obviously, is no exception. It is  fascinating  the way he plays with his own personal history: How would the people he knew and loved have responded to a crisis like this? That's a pretty compelling subject to explore, and he goes at it with great gusto, filling the story with miles of precise detail and dashing off into the land of the truly implausible only toward the end (just at the point it might make sense to do so). He has the ability to make just about anyone, on any side of an issue, sound entirely reasonable. That is a gift and it helps keep his story on course.    I bought into his sense of dread and the way he conveys a deep-seeded loss of innocence. Jewishness is a powerful part of this  - what it means to be a both Jew and an American,   how beautiful that almost always is and how terrible it just might for a moment be. I don't think he could have covered this territory any better if he were writing a nonfiction treatment of the subject.	2004-10-22

Nor can I say that the author's insights seemed particularly bold or original. <br /> <br />Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton and Burr - these are larger-than-life characters who shaped a nation. If you don't know much about them, you could do worse than reading this book. All in all, a decent work but not an outstanding one. <br /> <br />	2004-10-14

One can certainly quibble with the 20 highlights he has chosen, but that would be true of any book of this nature. I'm impressed by the way he's woven so much relevant material into those 20 chapters. <br /> <br />The book's strengths are its portraits of important individuals, from Les Paul to Elvis to Kurt Cobain, and the way Bordowitz chronicles the important role that technology has played in musical change. Its weaknesses: A reliance on too many generalizations - I don't know how many times he refers to some year as a bad year in music - and sloppiness. (Eddie Cochran, for instance, is spelled Cochrane twice.) Those flaws don't wreck an otherwise fine book, but I'd say he could have used a better editor. <br /> <br />	2004-10-04

I know that some readers will disagree with some of its conclusions - Samuel Adams is portrayed as the single most important person in the Colonial drift toward revolution - but I found it to be a well-written and well-argued book.    Clarification on one point: Hallahan's book isn't actually about one day - it details the battles of Lexington and Concord, then goes on to describe what occurred in New York, Philadelphia, Williamsburg and London when word of those battles reached those cities.	2004-08-30

The book has a lot of interesting things to say about architecture, and the portrayal of Finland is certainly compelling.    The author's execution, however, left something to be desired: Some of the supporting characters are stereotypes, the dialogue was a trifle trite, and the story gets bogged down in rehashing certain doomed relationships.

It is simply not thorough enough.  <br />A warning: If you're interested in Wallis' fantastic years at Warner Bros. - the era of Bogart, Cagney, Raft, Flynn, Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan - this book isn't for you. The author spends much more time dealing with Wallis' independent productions, particularly his big budget productions in the 1960s and early 1970s. Hal Wallis, a superb movie producer, certainly deserves a book that is more focused and complete.	2004-07-01

Fast's main character here, Citizen Tom Paine (was Fast playing off the title of Citizen Kane?), comes across as an idealistic firebrand incapable of living a &quot;normal&quot; life, at least not without large quantities of alcohol. For the price of admission, the reader gets a look at both the Revolutionary War and the French Revolution. It's worth a read.	2004-06-17

The level of detail is fairly astounding - the author has something to say about just about everyone who ever met the man - and he covers all of his films thoroughly.

Fuller was a colorful character, and he didn't mind raising a ruckus, something which makes for lively reading. He also saw more and did more than most of us ever will, and his book is a parade of many of the 20th century's most fascinating events and characters. My biggest regrets after reading this work are 1) that he didn't get more of his film projects on to the screen and 2)  that so many of his books are out of print. If his other books are half as entertaining as this one, I very much would like to read them.	2004-02-09

It is at its best when it shares the stories of soldiers fighting at the front and when it relays the thoughts of the Egyptian military commander. One gets a feeling for the  brutality of combat, as well as the chaos and relentlessness of it all.<br />As it gets further from the action, it gets weaker - Golda Meir and Anwar Sadat never move to the forefront of the story. The U.S. airlift isn't mentioned at all, nor the U.S.-Soviet brinksmanship that threatened to make this a world war. In my mind, the book lacks context because of these omissions.	2004-01-14

After all, the IMDB can cover far more ground, provide a far wider range of information than any film book could. And it never needs to be reissued. <br />Yet, the latest version of Thomson's work proves there still is use for a good film reference book. Thomson's book may lack the width of IMDB but it beats it in terms of depth. Filled with bite-sized insights and concise explanations about movie people from D.W. Griffith to Reese Witherspoon, this is a work of passion, precision and knowledge. No one will agree with him on everything, even on most things. But, his skill at argument makes his opinions impossible to dismiss, and he rarely seems unfair. He recognizes when he represents the minority opinion on a subject (as with director John Ford, whom he has little admiration for) and rarely dismisses an interesting subject out of hand.	2003-10-15

I was able to talk to or correspond with dozens of old players, from Hall of Famers like Otto Graham, Chuck Bednarik, Steve Van Buren, Lou Groza and Crazy Legs Hirsch to guys who only had a cup of coffee in the NFL; much of what they had to say is woven into my narrative.

It does not bend over backward to be fair to everyone else: Gellman finds it too easy to lump New Deal liberals with Socialists and Communists - making it seem the only difference that he sees between them is shades of pink. That makes it hard to accept his arguments about red-baiting - arguments that are important to Gellman's treatment of Nixon as an honorable, ethical lawmaker ... Still, this is a stimulating work and one that taught me a lot about one of America's most fascinating political characters.	2000-12-17
