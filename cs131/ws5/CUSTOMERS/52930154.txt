Geoff Johns writing of the Flash and his entire universe has been nothing short of spectacular.  With BLITZ Johns manages to outdo himself!<br /><br />This is a solid 8 issue printing of a storyline that sees one of Wally West's colleagues become a new version of one of the Flash's oldest villains...PROFESSOR ZOOM.  The story is told with solid pacing, dialogue, plotting, and action.  Johns writes characters that we want to care about and that we can sympathize with (even when we don't agree with their actions).  In some of his earlier Flash TPB's there were a few too many asides for all the supporting cast.  This time out Johns keeps it simple with Wally West and Zoom.<br /><br />It's an exciting fast-paced read!	2005-08-17

In his writing run on JSA Geoff Johns has consistently delivered two types of stories: team battles on a massive scale and small character driven pieces.  His smaller stories have always been handled well showcasing a real love for the characters.  The larger epics have been of the more hit-or-miss variety.<br /><br />Black Reign is written as well as any superhero epic.  There's action, plot, and a strong moral ground (for both the heroes and villains...and rarely does that happen in comics).  In fact the political end of the story hits solidly with current developments in Iraq.  I was torn between my respect of the Black Adam as he fought to reclaim his homeland from tyrants, to my understanding of why the JSA were forced to go into the country and battle Adam and his companions.<br /><br />JSA: BLACK REIGN is a great read for any comic book fan!	2005-08-15

A good setting, great scientific background, and a quick pace.  Of course it also suffers the other typical problems with Crichton novels...weak characters, and the familiar prose of problem-hypothesis-scientific explanation-new problem (and repeat).<br /><br />The story focuses on nanotechnology (microscopic robots) and how they are let loose from a laboratory into the environment.  Naturally they begin to \\"prey\\" on anything they view as a threat and it's up to our computer-programming hero to come in and save the day.<br /><br />The book reads like it could someday be a big screen movie.  Overall I had fun with this book, not as good as Jurassic Park but better than Congo.	2005-08-10

However Chosen Prey was definately one of the weaker novels in the series.  On the plus side it's a fast read, the character of Lucas Davenport is enjoyable to spend time with, and the workings of police-vs.-criminal element are quite unique.<br /><br />Where Chosen Prey falters though is two key elements.  First the antagonist James Qatar is one of the weakest killers to step foot in a Prey novel.  It's clear from the early chapters that he's not really going to be a force to be reckoned with.  Second, and most importantly, the ending of this book is not only telegraphed (I saw it coming well over 100 pages from the climax) but it is darn close to a repeat of the closing of NIGHT PREY (also one of Sandford's weaker Prey books).  The setting may change but the characters involved and their motivations rang so solid that I made the comparison in endings before the climax was reached.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series read Chosen Prey.  If you're new to the series I'd recommend reading them in order (Rules of Prey, Shadow Prey...) or just checking out the best offerings (Mind Prey, Winter Prey).	2005-08-04

First this review will not spoil any aspect of the novel (unlike many others you'll find on this page)...the fun of this novel and series is not just in the reading but in the discovery.<br /><br />That said HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE ranks with the best of the Potter sequence.  It continues to unfold adventure, mystery, suspense, and a colorful mythology that only gets stronger and stronger.<br /><br />So what should you expect in this latest novel?<br /><br />1 - A less whiney Harry...and definately one who is on his way to becoming an adult with a very serious mission<br /><br />2 - A powerful bond between Harry and Dumbledore.  In many ways this novel reads more like a Mentor-Mentee book than all the rest.<br /><br />3 - Fun with Ron and Hermione...ah the angst of teenage romance.<br /><br />4 - MORE SNAPE!  Professor Snape continues to be one of the most richly written and complex characters in this series.  His exchanges with Harry are funny and gripping and true fans will want to read these parts over and over...there's clues that abound in their actions and dialogue.<br /><br />5 - A stunning connection to past novels.  I am continually amazed at how JK Rowling pulls information from her previous books and shows us how all of these stories are interconnected (hint: Go back and read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets...it's important!).<br /><br />6 - LORD VOLDE...I can't even say it myself!  A good villain needs a great back story.  This novel gives us the backstory and clearly explains the actions and reactions of the Harry Potter and Tom Riddle war.<br /><br />7 - Scares!  The story gets dark and gloomy and reminds us that although many parts of the Harry Potter mythos are fun...there is danger (serious danger) around every corner.<br /><br />8 - A TURNING POINT!  After this novel several characters will never be the same!  Many won't be back at Hogwarts...ever!  True motivations are revealed and through it all Rowling reminds us that sometimes it's a bit more complex than just being GOOD or EVIL.<br /><br />9 - The Half-Blood Prince!  Who is this person?  Don't let people spoil it for you!

This was a major league disappointment!<br /><br />With talent like Kurt Busiek and George Pereze there is no reason for subpar stories like these.  This TPB collects Avengers 23-30 and if you haven't read them...YOU AREN'T MISSING ANYTHING!<br /><br />Ok, the artwork is sensational...so if you like great art you'll be satisfied as Perez is hands down the best illustrator of any team superhero book in comics history.<br /><br />Story lines?  BORING!  A lot of pointless team shuffling brought about by racist picketers.  It leads to Triatholon joing the group...so we can have a minority character.  Now, I'm all for equal representation, but the way this was written reminded me of comics from the 1960's.  A sad commentary on our time.  There's a reason we don't see characters like Triatholon and Silverclaw making a difference in the Marvel Universe.  BECAUSE THEY'RE LAME!  They should not be wasting pages in the Avengers when there were so many BETTER characters to choose from.<br /><br />I'm a comics fan of over 28 years and I can safely say, I HATED THIS TPB!  It just shows that not every issue of a title (or in this case 8) needs to be reprinted into a collection.	2005-06-30

Having read all six of the movie-based Star Wars novels, I feel Revenge of the Sith is the strongest offering.  By now everyone knows the story of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of Darth Vader.  In fact, the odds are if you're reading this review you've also already seen the movie.  So we'll stick to the basics.<br /><br />Author Matthew Stover does a solid job of keeping the novelization close to the movie.  It's clear from some key plot points and dialogue that he was working from an early script draft and not the finished product that we see on film.  That's a good thing because it allows people to enjoy a new take on Sith even if they've seen the movie multiple times.<br /><br />The key difference is that the novel stays close to the key combatants of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin.  We are given plenty of insight into their thoughts, motivations, and fighting styles.  The novel makes it painfully clear what drives Anakin to the dark side of the force.  If you're looking for a retread of the movie you may be disappointed though as key moments like the destruction of various Jedi, the battle of Kashyyk, and the duel between Yoda and Sidious are glossed over to allow a more in depth look at Kenobi and Skywalker.<br /><br />Still, this is a strong novel with a good writer driving it.  Star Wars and sci-fi fans will love it.	2005-06-26

Before I vent on this wandering book, let me preface this by saying that I have read several books by author Christopher Golden and enjoyed them all.  I purchased Straight on 'til Morning because Golden's name was on it and I assumed I would have a 320 page entertaining read on my hands.<br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />WRONG.<br /><br />Straight on 'til Morning meanders all over the place with a first act that takes almost two-thirds of the book.  Several times I had to remind myself that this book indeed came from the 'Horror' section of my book store.  The first two thirds reads like it wants to be Stand By Me (complete with more swearing than one could experience at a Chris Rock concert).  So for 200 pages we're left with one basic dilemma.  The protagonist is in love with a girl who is two years older than him and fears that his love will not be returned.<br /><br />Then we get to the final act of this novel which turns into Peter Pan (literally) on acid.  As this act took place I kept flipping back to the cover and asking myself, \\"Is this the same book I've been reading or did I pick up the wrong one by mistake?\\"<br /><br />Golden struggles with so many problems that all show signs of a book that needed a stronger editor.  Characters are not fully established.  Plot points take forever to develop (man was that first act L-O-N-G).  Things happen that are never explained (where the hell did that car come from in the final battle?).  And worst of all the one unpardonable of any novel...taking the antagonist of 300 pages and then suddenly making him sympathetic and helpful of the protagonist.  Boy does that remove all sense of conflict and make one wonder...Couldn't this whole thing have just been avoided?<br /><br />That's how I felt after realizing I spent $6.99 and 10 hours of my life on this book.  Couldn't this whole thing have just been avoided?	2005-01-17

For any WWe fanatic who loves the wrestler Edge (aka Adam Copeland) then this book is for you.  If you're like me and are a WWe fan but think Edge is OK, well...the book is still for you.<br /><br />Adam Copeland on Edge is a fast, fun, entertaining read (100% written by the man himself).  At just under 300 pages the book reads like a short story.  I was finished with it in less than a day and frankly, the smile never left my face.  Edge comes off like a fun guy to be around.  He was influenced by comics, wrestling (duh!), hockey, video games, pranks, and just having a fun time.<br /><br />It's hilarious to read about his early friendship with Christian, misadventures wrestling in the far off regions of Canada, and early matches in the WWe.  The read is so smooth it feels like you're just listening to Edge talk directly to you.<br /><br />My one small gripe would be that he could have gone into more detail on some of the events and matches in his life.  A little more insight into his fellow WWe wrestlers and his own thoughts as he developed his character and various matches.  This is the one area that signals the \\"First Time Author\\", but all in all I highly recommend this book to all wrestling fans who might want a few hours away from a TV.	2004-12-27

But I kept going and read their second adventure (The Reptile Room) and started to feel more comfortable with the writing styles and the approach that the author was taking.<br /><br />Now comes Book The Third a.k.a. The Wide Window (all Snicket novels have titles that begin with the same letter) and I'm pleased to say that things continue to pick up speed.  The unique writing style is present with Sunny's one word can mean so much utterances, the poor disguises of Count Olaf, the stupidity of every adult in the world, and the peril upon peril that Violet and Klaus must overcome.<br /><br />It was hard for me to stop reading The Wide Window, and harder yet not to laugh at some of the masterful lines of dialogue and situations.  For any child who wants to see, or has already seen, the Series of Unfortunate Events movie, then I wholeheartedly recommend reading Books 1-3 in this entertaining series for readers of all ages.	2004-12-25

In fact, my interest was truly all about the cover (from a poster I stared at while eating burgers at Red Robin).  Now 476 pages later I'm glad I took the time to be entertained by this thrilling one-of-a-kind tale.<br /><br />Carter Beats the Devil is a period piece much like L.A. Confidential.  Real people mingle with fictitious characters in situations that happened, might have happened, and probably didn't happen.  The tale centers on second-tier magician Charles Carter who possibly killed 1920's President Warren Harding.  Did he?  Like everything else in the novel the reader is presented with clues and then taken for a ride straight out of left field.<br /><br />One of the things that makes Carter Beats the Devil a truly unique read is the pacing.  Parts move along at a medium speed, then some hints are dropped about what is coming around the corner, then a situation suddenly strikes, and we, the reader, are left to route for Carter has he attempts to escape with his life.<br /><br />It's all here: murder, mystery, dastardly evil magicians, peril, crooked FBI agents, traps, love, history, action, suspense, and an overall fun time.	2004-12-23

Eventually my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to dive in and see where authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins planned on taking me.<br /><br />Overall I found the first story in this series to be intriguing.  The story (if you didn't know from reading the thousands of other reviews) revolves around The Rapture of the Christians who are taken to heaven (along with every child on Earth) and the perils that await the populace that has been left behind...with the rise of the antichrist no less.<br /><br />While a speedy page turner, the story had some flaws: weak characters, a fairly narrow viewed storyline considering we're talking about the last people on the entire planet and yet we only really worry about 4 of them, and the fact that it seems like a majority of the population doesn't mind that ALL of the children and a good portion of adults have vanished.  If this happened in real life panic would rule the streets in a matter of minutes...but in this story things calm down after a day or two.<br /><br />The last twenty pages though are very gripping and definately the meat and potatoes of this book.  It leaves me with hope that future novels in this series will pick up speed and add a bit of \\"adventure\\" to the story.<br /><br />Left Behind is certainly not for everyone, but if you are of strong religious beliefs, or if you're just curious to see what millions of people are reading then you can do a lot worse for a few hours of reading entertainment.	2004-12-21

Mark Bagley again handles the art chores and this tag team can pretty much create the best Spidey stories on the market with little effort.<br /><br />Volume 7 reprints six issues of the title and weeves its way through stories involving Peter and Mary Jane's relationship, Spidey's search for a new costume, mutants and the Ultimate X-Men, and an indepth view of Aunt May's character.  The action and pacing for the stories is fine but the final chapter that really gives Bendis' Aunt May a turn in the spotlight borders on what a great story-teller he can be.<br /><br />Any new fans to Spider-Man comics can do a lot worse than starting with Ultimate Spider-Man: Irresponsible.  And if it lacks the superhero action that you require then I strongly recommend Ultimate Spider-Man Volumes 2 and 4.	2004-11-09

That's alot considering we're talking about a pornstar.  So what happens in her life that is so different from the stereotypical image we all have of the pornstar?  She makes a lot of money.  That's about it.<br /><br />Where she needed 576 pages (many of which are solo picture pages of her since I'm sure she loves herself as much as her fans do), I can sum up her life in a few lines.<br /><br />1.  She had a troubled childhood.  Daddy ignored her.<br /><br />2.  She met the wrong man and stayed in the relationship for years.<br /><br />3.  She stripped.<br /><br />4.

The Reptile Room is the second book in the series and from what I gather will be included in the movie.<br /><br />The books in the series deal with the 3 Baudelaire orphans and all the bad, worse, and horrendous ('horrendous' here means a little bit worse than bad) encounters that happen between them and their evil nemesis Count Olaf (who will stop at nothing to get their inheritance).<br /><br />The first book in the series The Bad Beginning took a while for me to get into.  But by the end of the second book the author's writing style had grown on me.  In fact, many of his in-jokes, word play, and situations actually made me laugh out loud.  That says a lot for a book that involves: murder, poisonous snakes, whodunnit mysteries, and ill tidings towards little children.<br /><br />I recommend The Reptile Room to young readers and also think it's a great book for parents or teachers to read aloud to children.  The jokes will be a great way to bond reader with audience.	2004-08-04

Avengers World Trust is a collection of Geoff Johns first six issues on his too brief run on the monthly title.  Johns has worked miracles over at DC with his great run on Flash and his resurgence of classic characters and plots on JSA.  Sadly, the most he brings to World Trust is a standard adventure.<br /><br />The first four issues deal with the Avengers battling a mystic enemy that is transplanting the capitals of the Earth to another dimension.  Nothing new is really brought to the storyline, but Johns reestablishes members like Namor, The Falcon, and even government liason Henry Gyrich.  The art is bad but the plotting and action are passable.<br /><br />The fifth issue included sets up where Johns plans on taking the title by allowing the Avengers to operate within the United Nations.  It's a nice paced story that allows us to reattach ourselves to the Avengers as people.<br /><br />The final issue (the best), and a great example of what Geoff Johns is known for, deals with two new members Ant-Man and Jack of Hearts. This is an excellent story in duality that treats these two characters better than they have been handled since the 1970's.  It's a must read for any Avengers fan and the art is solid throughout.<br /><br />So, six issues...one possible classic story and five standard adventures.	2004-07-23

How do you make a movie/screenplay/novel for Alien vs. Predator? Easy just mix: Alien, Predator, Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Deep Blue Sea, The Thing, X-Files, and just about every other post 80's sci-fi/horror movie into a blender and puree for about one minute.<br /><br /> Now, obviously the movie hasn't come out so perhaps all the flaws in the novel will be fixed...but I doubt it. What other reviewers fail to grasp is that author Marc Cerasini is obligated to follow the script by Paul W.S. Anderson, thus all the pros and cons of the story are not the novel's author's fault.<br /><br /> That said, we definately get some good fights (which I guess is a requirement since the title features the word &quot;vs.&quot;). However everything feels fairly generic and nothing new is brought to the table concering the two main species. If you've seen their respective movies you'll know what's coming to the table: face huggers, angry queens, acid blood, high tech weapons, green phosphorescent blood, invisible stealth, etc...<br /><br /> Probably the best aspect of the story is the unique labyrinth pyramid that the combatants do battle inside. Its' ever shifting walls, chambers, and chasms provide a nice touch to separate people and to place characters into intense battles.<br /><br /> The weakest area of the story would have to be the humans (notice how it's not called Alien vs. Predator vs. Human). It's obvious that only one character born on Earth will survive. But we spend 50% of the novel with these humans, we learn little about them, and then watch as they are dispatched...often far too quickly to even &quot;enjoy&quot; it.<br /><br /> The largest flaw of the story would have to deal with the sudden birth of hundreds of Aliens. The last time I checked one alien was birthed from one human. At the most we would have 15 human hosts but inexplicably late in the story there are hundreds of aliens (if you know the answer to this feel free to email me).<br /><br /> This said, I will say that I read the novel in 2 days. It's a fast simple read (probably a good recommend for teen readers) and does keep the pages turning entertainingly fast. In the long run it's better than Alien Resurrection and Predator 2...but nothing you'll remember a few years from now.). <br />  <br /> This said, I will say that I read the novel in 2 days.

MEG: Primal Waters is the third novel in the MEG series (and a fitting wrap up to a nice trilogy).  The first two parts MEG and The Trench had their share of strong and weak points.  I'm happy to say that Steve Alten's work as an author continues to grow and MEG: Primal Waters excels at delivering lots of fun.  This is the perfect novel to read on a beach, next to a pool, or even in the bathtub...if you're near water you'll get goosebumps.<br />The story revolves around all of the characters from the first two novels in the series and nicely wraps together old plot points while feeling fresh the entire time.  Our hero Jonas Taylor (older than the standard American protagonist) gets tangled up in a reality show that wants to incorporate MEGs into the entertainment.  At the same time Jonas' wife Terry and their friends and children deal with the appearence of a couple other MEGS.  The three stories contiunally entertwine and cliffhang keeping the reader in a perpetual state of suspense.  Alten does a nice job of creating new scenarios where bait (usually people) and the Meg(s) continually meet up for a meal.  Any fans of the San Francisco Giants will enjoy one chapter in particular.<br />The pacing and action are top notch and make for one of the fastest 300+ page reads I've had in a long time.  The only area that detracts somewhat from the enjoyable story is the character of Danielle (Jonas' daughter).  She is so completely out of control and unlikable that it becomes impossible to want to see her in any scenario except being served to a MEG.  Protagonists need to have at least a couple of positive features...she has none.  But one character does not stop a novel this entertaining.<br />Swim out to a raft in a big lake and enjoy an afternoon of reading...and hopefully you'll have enough courage to swim back to shore.	2004-07-07

Man, this series started with such promise with Armageddon and Warhawk (co-authored by Christopher Golden, and now I'm starting to really see how much he brought to the table).<br />Sadly the leaking in the Galactica started when Golden left the writing duties and the story quickly tumbled into collapse.  Each novel is plagued by grammar and spelling errors, lack of continuity (weren't Sheba and Apollo in love at one point?), and cliched plot points...pregnant with demon child anyone?  How many times are characters believed dead only to return just fine.<br />So Resurrection, Rebellion, and Paradis just kept dragging this storyline, series, and beloved characters into the black hole of science fiction literature.<br />Destiny adds little new or good to the whole series.  Except now Baltar (the man who helped lead to the near extinction of the human race gets to be a hero?).  Yeah, that's like Hitler and Stalin coming to the rescue.  Give me a break!<br />Avoid this book and horrid series at all costs.

I picked it up and was a tad apprehensive about following along with all the Japanese names and the overall length (600+ pages for an action story).<br />Needless to say there was nothing to worry about.  Battle Royale tells one of the most creative, quickest, shocking, and most violent stories of any book I've read in the last few years.<br />The premise follows the sci-fi standard of the human death sport where we play until only one contestant survives.  This time we're playing with middle school children on a remote island.  You kill your classmates or they kill you.  In the midst of the staggering action (and body count) we see plenty of unique personalities emerge and some of the battles are truly inventive.  It kept me turning the pages.<br />Anyone who enjoys an exciting read should check out Battle Royale...and if you can't get your fix on Death Sports then I also strongly advise you to pick up THE LONG WALK and THE RUNNING MAN by Stephen King (aka Richard Bachman).	2004-04-10

Smith again works in plenty of religious angles and symbolism (much like he did in the far better Daredevil: Guardian Devil).  However after 2 comics storylines and a movie (Dogma)...it's starting to get tired.  I'm glad Kevin enjoys religion and feels like he can work it into every storyline but it doesn't work for Green Arrow.  Why doesn't it work?  Because Green Arrow is essentially a guy with a bow.  Putting him into a storyline that involves Heaven and Hell and the life ever after is just silly.  Keep that stuff for the cosmic characters.<br />  Other areas that Quiver comes up short a few arrows?  Well, for anyone that is not familiar with the DCU (DC Universe Characters) then this storyline is a horrible starting on point as too many characters to count show up continually with little or no introduction.  The villain in the story is weak and doesn't do much to leave the reader anticipating any form of confrontation with Green Arrow.  It also takes Green Arrow way too long to figure out what is happening or to listen and start believing what other characters are telling him(I believe 7 of 10 chapters)!  As a reader I was caught up well in advance and found myself saying to Green Arrow, \\"Will you please just shut up and accept that you don't know what is happening!\\"  The ending of the storyline is also rushed and doesn't really give much character development of Green Arrow, other than he's still selfish and could care less about informing his friends how things turned out, and that he doesn't mind some cold-blooded vigilante justice that most \\"heroes\\" would not only frown upon but all in all fight to stop.<br />Now, there are a few minor spots that do help the storyline.  First, Kevin Smith is a good writer for dialogue and he does deliver some funny scenes (he certainly understands what makes Batman so cool).  Second, Smith is a good staple for comics and should continue to write for characters that need to be \\"made cool\\" for new readers...he obviously revived the dead characters of Daredevil and Green Arrow(just avoid relgion).  Third, Smith knows his way around the DCU and does an excellent job of showing us how numerous characters interact with each other (I enjoyed seeing Black Manta, Aqua Man, Arsenal, and Superman most of all).

Don't bother reading this if you haven't already read Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire. There's plenty of backstory and characters that are not needlessly reintroduced.<br />3 - Harry Potter as a character is given much more depth. Is he prone to be a hero? YES. Does he start to develop a teenagers attitude? YES. Does he start to learn what his place in the grand scheme of things is? YES. There is more to Harry in this book than many \\"adult\\" novels characterize for their protagonists.<br />4 - It reminds you about what it was like to be a teenager feeling those first confusing pains of romance. Should I kiss her? Should I hold her hand? Why is she crying? What did I say wrong? Harry and Cho is a fun relationship to see begin...and possibly end. However, the best one is the budding romance between Ron and Hermione...and it's doubtful that either one sees it happening.<br />5 - Good villains abound in this story. The new D.A.T.D.A. professor is a royal pain in the broomstrick. Never have I read through a novel where I prayed to see a character get what they deserve until I met Dolores Umbridge. Aside from her there's also the mystery and vileness of Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters (Come on, how can you even say \\"Death Eaters\\" without expecting someone to die?).<br />6 - Someone dies! And it shows that not every death need be heroic. The death also serves the point of helping other characters develop.<br />7 - The complex relationship between Harry and Professor Snape. Snape has gone from a wood-be suspect in the first few books to a rich character. I find myself most looking forward to the chapters where these two characters interact. The best chapter of Order of the Phoenix by far is the one entitled \\"Snape's Worst Memory\\". To think that an antagonist to Harry like Snape might actually make the readers feel sorry for him...and then hate him again all in the span of a few pages. That's just good writing!<br />8 - Action! For 800+ pages the book certainly moves quickly. And even though we can enjoy some familiar staples (Quidditch, walks in the Forbidden Forest), there's also plenty of new things.<br />9 - Dialogue. J.K. Rowling does a phenomenal job with her dialogue. As a teacher of 13 year olds, I find that when I read the Harry Potter books the kids talk and act like...KIDS.

Rowling does an incredible job of listening to kids in her real life because what flows from her pen just sounds genuine.<br />10 - IT MAKES KIDS WANT TO READ.

It was a fast read that jumps off the page like a movie more than anything I have read since Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (which made it to a movie) or Robert McCammon's The Wolf's Hour (which like Hunter cries out to be developed by Hollywood).<br />The characters in Hunter are solid.  The settings are well done.  The pace is like a roller coaster.  And the monster is well...a monster!<br />The only real problems that this novel has are that 565 pages is a bit much for a simple action novel.  And yes, sometimes there is such a thing as TOO much action (which is why we went from 5 stars to 4).<br />Still, if you're a fan of action and horror and prefer to stick to a more &quot;pop&quot; style of writing then HUNTER is a great place to start.	2003-04-22

This TPB collects the first six issues of the series and re-introduces us to the characters of: Captain America, Iron-Man, Thor, Giant-Man, and the Wasp.  Each of the characters is handled well and Mark Millar does a good job of setting the tone of the series...which starts off slow and then powers forward to the conclusion of Issue #6.<br />On the weakness front we have Millar's usual M.O. of rushed storylines and too many characters.  Unlike his run on Authority or Ultimate X-Men he has just enough characters to juggle without too much confusion (Thor is the only lacking character in the TPB).  The only other problem that readers may face when diving into The Ultimates is that it does not tell a complete tale.  This TPB was rushed out while the title is enjoying an immensely popular run so there is no 'end' to the stroyline...but there is one heck of a set-up for what will undoubtedly unfold in the second TPB.<br />But let's look at the strengths of the Ultimates:<br />1) A great WWII intro with Captain America as well as a new take on the Cap - Bucky friendship.<br />2) A great twist on why millionaire Tony Stark would want to be Iron-Man.<br />3) The strong use of SHIELD and Nick Fury in setting up the Ultimates...and then the hilarious idea that...\\"Now that we have a superhero team...what happens if we never have any villains to fight?\\"<br />4) A good battle with The Hulk (who is much more enjoyable to read when instead of saying \\"Hulk Smash!\\", we get...\\"I'm gonna rip off your head and #@!& down your neck!\\"  It scared me.<br />5)  Domestic violence between Giant-Man and the Wasp which was handled more powerfully than anything I'd read in a long long time.  Rereading the scene and reading between the lines only helps demonstrate that these are heroes with \\"real world\\" troubles.<br />All in all I recommend The Ultimates.  While not as strong as Brian Michael Bendis run on Ultimate Spider-Man, it does outshine the Ultimate X-Men and 95% of the comics and TPB's being published today.it does outshine the Ultimate X-Men and 95% of the comics and TPB's being published today.	2003-01-20

Ever since I was a little comic book geek I'd always had a fascination with the character of The Flash.  He had cool powers and a unique costume.  His assortment of great villains was probably second only to Batman.  And the majority of his comics ended with some of the best cliff-hangers ever.  Alas, in the past 20 years The Flash title has had numerous high and low points (or slow and fast if you'd prefer).  Well, I'm happy to inform you that with THE FLASH: BLOOD WILL RUN, we're heading towards another HIGH point!<br />Writer Geoff Johns has brought an incredible level of energy to his story-telling.  These stories move along at rapid-fire pacing and don't give the reader a moment to catch their breath.  Whether the Flash is battling the new villain Cicada and his evil followers, or dealing with his illegit-son, or in just trying to handle the myriad of characters from past and present who continually enter and re-enter his life.  My personal favorite being mucho-weird ex-girlfriend Francis Kane (the super powered Magenta).  Wally West is the rare hero who had such a promiscuous past that it's always fun to see some of the EX's return to wreck havoc in his life.<br />It's clear with this first collection of John's work on Flash that he is a long-time fan of the character.  He delivers plenty of action, humor, and the essential chapter ending cliff-hangers that will keep you guessing...HOW DOES THE FLASH GET OUT OF THIS ONE?	2002-06-21

Marvel has already scored a grand-slam with the Ultimate Spider-Man title which managed to succeed on every level and even surpass the regular Spider-Man comics.  However, with Ultimate X-Men they only manage the equivalent of a basehit.<br />On the good side, Ultimate X-Men is a fresh new take on the characters in the X-Men universe.  Each is presented in a new light (albeit not all that different).  Cyclops is still the stoic field-leader.  Professor X is the guidance and heart of understanding between mutants and humans.  Magento and the Brotherhood are still the evil forces that want to rule the world in the name of Homo Superior.  Wolverine is still...Wolverine.  And there are familiar members in Storm, Colossus, and Beast.  Jean Grey is the big exception who has changed completely from the wholesome female of the early Uncanny X-Men stories.  The artwork is excellent and the dialogue is outstanding.  Writer Mark Millar also manages to develop an \\"epic\\" tale as the team's trial by fire.<br />On the bad side, the regular X-Men titles suffer because there are just too many characters.  Ultimate X-Men: The Tomorrow People does not manage to correct this problem.  There is a 6-issue storyline that jams over 15 characters into the plot.  Obviously there is little room to get to know anyone (a problem that could have been rectified with just a few extra chapters), which means that new readers unfamiliar with X-Men characters will have a lot of work to do just to understand things.  The action scenes are also a bit hectic and at points things just feel rushed.<br />While not as solid an outing as Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men: The Tomorrow People is a solid beginning that can hopefully lead to some stronger follow-up stories.	2002-06-20

BEHIND THE MASK OF SPIDER-MAN by: Mark Cotta Vaz is one of the best &quot;making of&quot; movie books I have ever read.  Fair warning though, this book is so thorough that if you have not already seen Spider-Man then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!  Upon viewing some of the great color photos and reading the indepth information, you'll be completely robbed of any true movie surprises.<br />With that said...<br />In 205 pages, Vaz manages to provide tons of background on the characters, history, and production stages of Spider-Man.  You'll find everything from pictures of original comic page art to step-by-step photos on the various concept sketches of both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin (Goblin in particuar is all over the place in the various designs).  Vaz clearly did his homework as there are numerous interviews and sound bytes from everyone from Stan Lee to Sam Raimi to Willem Dafoe to producers, stunt people, and FX coordinators.<br />Rarely do &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; books read as fast and as enjoyable as this one.  Now granted, I am a HUGE Spider-Man fan, but I believe that anyone who enjoyed the movie will find lots of insight to be gained from this informative and entertaining book.	2002-05-28

For those of you not familiar with Mr. Bendis, I strongly urge you to read the Ultimate Spiderman TPB's.<br />With POWERS Bendis is trying to start an original premise and on this fact alone it's a brave move.  A title that focuses on normal police officers who investigate superheroes, villains, and the situations that surround them.  Sounds like it could be a strong clever storyline involving the interactions of \\"real\\" people with costumed crime fighters like the phenomenal MARVELS by Kurt Busiek.<br />However, POWERS never really develops.  The characters stay only a few steps above one-dimensional, with several being down-right ridiculous versions of comic relief.  The heroes are also few and far between.  The artwork leaves a lot to be desired, especially since we are given a story involving \\"real\\" people and it is being displayed with artwork that borders on cartoons and anime.<br />In a story involving a murder of a top-level hero (Retro-Girl) there needs to be a stronger emphasis on the suspects, the people invovled, and the people that knew and interacted with her.  However, Bendis bounces his protagonists around from one errand to another and doesn't allow them to bond any more than he allows the readers to develop some form of connection with anyone coming through the pages of this story.<br />I have not followed the latest issues of POWERS but as a collection of the first story arc I was very disappointed in an idea with tons of potential that simply did not deliver.	2002-04-14

I'm a 7th grade teacher and I introduced my students to this novel for the first time this year.  To my amazement they had never even heard of OLD YELLER.  Now, middle school students can be the toughest audience in the world but THEY LOVED THIS BOOK.<br />Author Fred Gipson perfectly captures the time period of Texas in the late 1800's and the challenges of daily life.  Into the mix of chores and adventures on the farm is the universal bond of a boy and his dog.  Travis and Old Yeller are two characters that any child will immediately connect with and grow to love.  And naturally as many novels geared towards younger readers, the conclusion will remain with them long after the novel has been read.<br />On a side note I must also recommend the classic Walt Disney version of OLD YELLER (VHS or DVD).  Young readers will enjoy the similarities and differences between novel and movie.  It's an excellent example to build discussion or writing lessons involving comparisons or contrasts.<br />And while I have continually mentioned young readers I should also comment that OLD YELLER is a must-read for people of any age group.  So the next time you need to be entertained by a great novel, pick up this classic.	2002-04-14

Paul Jenkins presents four storylines in Spiderman: One Small Break...one of them is good.  I'm a huge fan of Spidey but he has been portrayed in a much better style (both plotwise and artistically), look no further than J. Michael Straczynski's Spiderman: Homecoming for a perfect example.  Jenkins stories seem to slide back-and-forth between serious and cartoonish way too easily, the artwork only emphasizes the cartoonish nature.<br />The storylines presented here cover Peter Parker: Spiderman issues #27-28 and 30-34.  They include...<br />#1 - Spiderman battling his arch-enemy Stromm...and then being placed into a situation where he has to decide, \\"Is it right to kill someone if thousands of future lives will be saved?\\"  Interesting question but it could have been presented in a much stronger light.  The villain of Stromm is also not one of the stronger antagonists that Spidey has battled.<br />#2 - Spiderman battling a revenge hungry foe called Fusion.  This storyline takes several interesting turns, the most interesting being when Spiderman receives that \\"One Small Break\\" of the title's name.  Overall an average outing but there was plenty of untapped potential.<br />#3 - The best storyline of the bunch (and the only one worth reading in this collection) is a story dealing with Peter Parker (not Spiderman) and his past relationship with his Uncle Ben.  The story focuses around an annual attendance of a Mets game and it works on several levels.  Again there is some cartoonish nature that detracts from it and keeps it from reaching a \\"Best of...\\" level, but overall this one is a great read.<br />#4 - A silly and stupid and underdeveloped story about a man cursed with dangerous powers and who is being chased by some friendly monks (in the Monk-Mobile!).  UG!  Why was this story written in the first place...much less included in a TPB?  What a waste of space and it doesn't say much if this is the higher level of story to be included into a mainstream TPB.<br />If you're \\"Jones-ing\\" for a Spiderman read then you may want to pick up One Small Break.

It tells three tales:<br />1 - The Punisher locks heads with a renegade military general and his own personal island of mercenaries (including The Russian, from Ennis previous Punisher tales).  Punisher gets to do all the things we like to see him do; shoot, kill, maim, and get creative with the tools that he has on-hand.<br />2 - A character driven story about life in NYC and how it is still capable of crushing even the strongest of people.  The tale shows the Punisher attempting to track down an ex-army friend that has...lost his purpose in life.<br />3 - A picture driven story (no dialogue at all) showing the Punisher chase down a criminal and how these actions can not only effect the lives of innocents, but how a similar action can be viewed as heinous when coming from a different character.<br />I like the Punisher, and I am a HUGE fan of Mr. Ennis work on other titles (notbably the Preacher series).  The problem with his take on Punisher is it feels like a half-way effort.  We don't get the violence, swearing, or grotesqueness that we expect to shock us in a tale about one man's war against crime...it just feels watered down.  On top of that the first story-arc features The Russian who is placed into a comic element that just doesn't work in this type of story (Punisher afterall is not Preacher).<br />So when all is said and done we have a version of The Punisher that shows signs of what a brilliant character he could be.  Marvel needs to loosen the reins on Ennis and allow him to cut loose with all the gusto that we know he and artist Dillon are capable of.  The Punisher's tale is the simplest of any comicbook character: REVENGE ON CRIMINALS (usually through extreme violence on a shocking level).  So in future endeavors I hope the writers will steer away from the comedy and focus on the driving force of Frank Castle, THE PUNISHER!ing level).

Any fan of high-brow intellectual comedy will want to read this book!  Any fan of current political attitudes (with a touch of political incorrectness) will want to read this book!<br />Dennis Miller is like the Rosetta Stone to high-I.Q., high references, and high laughter comedy.  The Rants give him a chance to vent on topics ranging from: Parenting, Religion, Fame, Air Travel, and Civility.  Unlike other comic tomes written by Jay leno, Drew Carey, and Bill Maher, you'll actually need to pay close attention as you laugh because Miller buries jokes within jokes.  In fact, I had to venture over to my Webster's Dictionary just to look up a few words that were laced within a Rant...and then I found myself laughing even harder.<br />The only minor point that stands between The Rants and a 5-star rating is the fact that for the most part Miller's Rants are simply word-for-word translations of monlogues on his HBO show (mixed with a few comedic segments from his various concerts).  However, if you're not an avid viewer of either of these areas then you'll be able to read and enjoy fresh material.<br />As for books written by comedians, I'd place The Rants alongside Jerry Seinfeld's Classic &quot;SEIN-LANGUAGE&quot; and George Carlin's &quot;Brain Droppings&quot;.

However after seeing previews for the upcoming Guy Pearce movie The Time Machine (which doesn't seem to have much in common with the novel) my interest was gained.<br />The Time Machine is actually more of a novella than a novel.  It clocks in at 85 pages in the volume I have.  But it's a fun and fast paced read.  The most shocking part of the story is that it was written in the late 1800's and yet it reads like it could have been written in the present.  The prose is crisp and direct and doesn't lose the reader.  The ideas are even more impressive considering they are over 100 years old and still hold up better than many time-travel books I have read lately.<br />So by saying that The Time Machine is probably the father of the time-travel genre, I have to say that it is also a fun adventure with a surprisingly sharp ending twist.  The story surrounds the first-person narrative of a man who builds a time-machine and travels into the distant (800,000 AD) future where man has evolved into two races: the gentle Eloi and the hostile Morlocks.  Beyond exciting adventure (trips into deep caverns, the loss of the time machine, battles in burning forests) the story does make general comments on the society we live in and how it may change around us...subtlely and dangerously.<br />All in all I enjoyed this story and I plan on reading other offerings by H.G. Wells who is truly a great science fiction writer.	2002-03-03

But after hearing some of her interviews on The Law I decided to give this book a shot.  I'm glad I did!<br />The book is short, to the point, and just plain fun!  Missy cuts straight to the chase and simply tells us about her years involved with professional wrestling.  We get stories about her intro, years in various organizations, times in the big companies, and times in between the sheets with some famous wrestlers.  I must confess the dirt is fun to hear but - OUCH!  Hurts to be Val Venis and Bills QB Jim Kelly I think.<br />The pictures in the book are a nice touch and Missy does manage to convey some fine story-telling about people like her wrestling ex-husband Eddie Gilbert (who I had never heard of but came to care about).  I think the only drawback to her story is that there isn't really a growth factor.  Missy is all about having fun in professional wrestling.  When you read the book you'll be having fun too but it won't stay with you beyond that.<br />Still, with the recent run of wrestling books Missy Hyatt's biography stands at #2 right behind Mick Foley's outstanding Mankind: Have a Nice Day!  Both of these books should be read by all fans of wrestling.	2002-02-17

I'm not a fan of Motley Crue (the people or their music) but this book came to my attention through all of the stories I have heard over the years.  As far as rock biographies go, it's a fast paced read.  Motley Crue epitomizes the message of \\"Sex, Drugs, and Rock N' Roll!\\"  So since there are so many other reviews I think I'll just share what I have learned about the band members through their 430 page opus.<br />Vince Neil has the most penultimate tear-jerker in the chapter that deals with the death of his daughter.  In a book made to shock and astonish, this was as touching a moment as anything I have read.  Beyond his love and loss, he comes off like a stand-up guy who enjoys the life style and isn't making excuses.<br />Nikki Sixx had a rough childhood and has so many father-son issues it's not even funny.  While I respect the fact that he's been through more turmoil than I'll ever know...get over it.  There's nothing more pathetic than listening to rock star millionaires pining away about how sad they are.  I guess money can't buy happiness.<br />Mick Mars has the least to say in this book and this left me the most intrigued.  He has battled rough times from personal illness to divorce to just plain being the victim of emotional abuse.  I'm amazed he stayed with the band as long as he has.  His is the true sad story in The Dirt.<br />Tommy Lee...moron.  Here is the epitome of a millionaire jerk who just never learns.  How a guy like this managed to bag babes like Heather Locklear, Pamela Anderson, and Carmen Electra...is beyond me.  Don't expect to learn anything from his chapters except to see a spoiled baby who is used to getting anything he wants, and if he doesn't then the tantrums start...then and now.<br />It's a testament to this book that I enjoyed reading it.  The chapters flow quickly telling each band member's story and author Neil Strauss never slows down.  And unlike biographies by other rock groups, these characters actually have some bizarre stories to tell...and how they survived is beyond me.  While I may not be racing out to buy any Crue music, I'm very happy that I read this biography.ries to tell...and how they survived is beyond me.

COOL BOOK!	This is the first novel by Phillip K. Dick that I have ever read (up to this point it's all been short fiction) and it's great sci-fi.  There's a reason that Dick (like Heinlein) is considered a legend in the science fiction genre because he was light years ahead of its time.<br />Blade Runner is all about duality and the contrast of living and artificial beings.  It's a great book to read and then discuss with other people because it easily lends itself to open-ended themes and symbolism.<br />The nice thing about the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is that it tells a similar and yet different story than the sci-fi classic movie Blade Runner.  You can enjoy both in their own medium and rest easy knowing that you're reading and watching a classic tale.	2002-01-30

If you're a long time fan of the Amazing Spiderman comics, if you're a new reader, or if you're just curious about this character before the Sam Raimi film hits on May 3, 2002...THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU.<br />Brian Michael Bendis is the best thing to happen to Spiderman since Stan Lee and John Romita.  He's got a firm grip on the character and successfully manages to put a 21st century spin on things so both old and new fans can equally enjoy.  Peter Parker is portrayed even more realistically here than he was in the classic run of the original title.  Here's a hero with worries, problems, goof-ups, and oh yeah...superpowers.<br />The first Ultimate Spiderman collection &quot;Power and Responsibility&quot; is arguably one of the Top 5 story collections in Spidey history.  With &quot;Learning Cruve&quot; Bendis proves that he is not going to have a sophomore jinx.<br />This collection of stories from the Ultimate Spiderman comic series covers issues 8-13.  Inside we're treated to: Peter still struggling with his powers and his new role as a hero, Spiderman's clash with the Kingpin, an Ultimate spin on J.J. Jameson and the staff of the Daily Bugle, and revamped characters of The Enforcers and Electro.<br />There is no way to give the story justice in a review.  You need to read and enjoy Learning Curve like any Spiderman fan should...with a smile on your face!	2002-01-23

New fans of comics and people who know little about Peter Parker and his alter-ego Spiderman will find this an enjoyable read and will leave it with a strong knowledge of the 30+ year history of the character.<br />The book covers everything from Spidey's origin and powers to his supporting cast including Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson, Mary Jane, and plenty more.  Key points in Spiderman's adventures are also covered including: the Death of Gwen Stacy, the Alien Costume, the mystery of the Hoblgoblin, and the Clone Saga.  Villains and vigilantes are also reviewed like: Green Goblin, The Vulture, Sandman, Electro, Venom, Carnage, and several minor characters that you might not expect to see included in a 170 page book.<br />The Ultimate Guide also mentions alternate creations of Spiderman like Spiderman 2099 and The Ultimate Spiderman (my personal favorite).<br />If DeFalco's Guide does have a weak spot it's that many entries have captions and paragraphs that simply reiterate the same material.  With two pages of information on a character this can become annoying to read the same fact three times in such a short space.  Also a personal gripe of mine is that sometimes laughable characters like The Rocket Racer were included while a more common classic villain like The Shocker was overlooked.  Instead of pages devoted to Will O The Wisp and Silvermane, I would have much rather preferred a more indepth look at some of the runs of Spiderman stories and the various plots they dealt with...alas maybe in Ultimate Guide #2 (hint).<br />All in all I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about the incredible character of Spiderman before the movie premieres on May 3, 2002.	2002-01-12

I was amazed when I heard that Bruce Campbell was writing his biography.  Frankly, he's not that old, nor famous, nor does he have that remarkable of a story to tell.  And yet, the kicker is that Bruce KNOWS all of this...he wrote the book anyways, and it's a great entertaining read.<br />Seeing Evil Dead II in the theatre was one of the most ingrained movie going experiences of my life.  It's a thrill to read all of Bruce's exploits surrounding his movie making as well as his TV adventures.  Jokes abound!<br />Bruce has a real wit that translates excellently to the page.  This comes through especially strong in his childhood adventures and in his work on the TV show &quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;<br />So if you want to have your life altered, read something else.  If you want to smile and have fun for a few hours and read about the life and times of a &quot;REAL&quot; actor...then check out this book.<br />To sum up this title in one word...&quot;GROOVY!&quot;	2002-01-05

This book is a MUST-READ for any fan of video games who grew up tossing quarters into games like: Donkey Kong, Centipede, and Defender.  Mr. Sellers does a great job of giving the early history of video games and then hitting the mainstay games from 1977-1984.  The color pictures are great reminders of these games from yesterday, and there's plenty of surprises too!<br />One of the books strong points is that Sellers is obviously a huge fan of video games, both arcade and home.  Anyone who can mention &quot;Tunnels of Doom&quot; (the best TI-99 game ever) is definately in &quot;the know&quot;.  The book has plenty of fun pages that include topics like: Bizarre Games, What were they thinking?, and bad sequels to games.  Trust me, if you remember games like PENGO and POOYAN then you'll want to read this book.<br />The only weak part of the book is the fact that if you have a strong memory for the mainstay games, then you may not learn much more.  There's not lots of insider information, just a brief synopsis and overview of the game topic and play.  I was hoping for a bit more in depth research on facts that the normal joe may not have known.<br />All-in-all this is an excellent read.  I hope Mr. Sellers tackles the later years of arcade gaming (Rolling Thunder, Double Dragon, Tekken) and maybe even looks at the history of homegaming...Commodore 64 anyone?  So the next time you need a break from all your X-boxing or Gamecubing, pull out this book and treat your eyes and brain to a different treat!	2001-12-27

It is an amazing journey.  An action packed story with wonderful characters.  A story packed with hundreds of pages of history, language, and research beyond any other fictional novel that I have ever encountered (only Frank Herbert's Dune novels come close).  And truly The Lord of the Rings Saga is the cornerstone of the Fantasy genre.<br />Forewarning, anyone who wishes to read the Lord of the Rings saga should start with The Hobbit.  Hobbit is an easy fun story and it will help ground you to the first 100 pages of LOR.<br />LOR is obviously divided into three main books (and the three upcoming movies that have helped gather even more hype around the saga).<br />Part 1 - Fellowship of the Ring is an excellent intro to the entire saga.  We learn of the history behind the Ring and its creator Sauron.  We learn of Bilbo Baggins acquiring it from the evil Gollum.  And, we learn of the gathering of the Fellowship of the Ring.  It's a lot to take in, and there are numerous characters to follow...but stay with it and the pay-off will be rewarding.  The highlight being the fellowship's battles in the dungeon mines with an army or orcs and the dreaded balrog.<br />Part 2 - The Two Towers is my personal favorite section of the LOR saga.  This section divides the adventures of the fellowship into two areas.  The hobbits journey to destory the ring and the fellowships battles with the evil wizard Saruman and the armies of evil.  The action in this part is incredible and delivered at a breakneck pace.  The highlight being Frodo and Sam traveling with the fiendish Gollum and then encountering the monster Shelob.<br />Part 3 - The Return of the King is the conclusion of the saga.  All of the storylines connect and the heroes and villains travel their course.  I can't mention anything here because at a combined amount of 1,000+ pages...if you make it this far then you should be allowed to enjoy the ride without any spoilers.<br />For any fan of reading and adventure and fans of any age I can praise nothing more highly than J,R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Saga..<br />For any fan of reading and adventure and fans of any age I can praise nothing more highly than J,R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings Saga.	2001-12-17

It's all here, the quest of Jesse Custer, the love of Tulip, the betrayal of Cassidy, the vengeance of Herr Starr, the face of Arseface, the Saint of Killers versus a battalion of tanks, and...one big nuclear weapon.<br />War in the Sun hits on almost every level.  While it isn't as grim as Volume #2 (Until the End of the World) nor as action packed as Volume #3 (Proud Americans), it's a great read.<br />Kudos to Mr. Ennis...now Wub! Wub!	2001-11-06

Jesse, Tulip, and Cass are all back together and the stories in this volume give the most insight to Cass and start to make him more of a character and not so much a characture.<br />New readers be warned...Preacher is not the kind of series that you can jump onto at any point...start with Book #1 - GONE TO TEXAS.<br />For those of you who have been along for the ride let's just say that Dixie Fried gives us more of what we love: dark humor, violence, disturbing ideas, masochism, sex, swearing, and even ArseFace (who makes me sick to my stomach every time).<br />The story telling is of A-quality and the only minor stumbling points are: weaker villains...who don't portray much menace for our protagonistic three, and a lack of Herr Starr (everyone's favorite whipping boy),<br />I myself have not yet read Volumes 6-9 but I'm heading in that direction and I guarantee that anyone who starts reading these adventures in GONE TO TEXAS will end up at THE ALAMO.<br />Humperdido!	2001-11-03

Unlike some of the tired and tried crime series out there, author John Sandford (Camp) has made each entry in his series quite unique.  Some of the books have given us a serial killer (Rules of Prey, Eyes of Prey), others handle action (Sudden Prey, Shadow Prey), others allow a cat-and-mouse storyline (Mind Prey, Silent Prey), and still others move right into a straight mystery (Winter Prey, Secret Prey).  Sandford keeps things fresh while constantly making each novel stand on it's own strengths.<br />The constant of the series is of course central character Lucas Davenport.  Millionaire cop?  Sure.  But once you get past this, show me one man out there who wouldn't want to be Lucas.  Smart.  Sexy.  Rich.  Adventurous.  I know I'd like to be him.<br />All this of course leads to this entry in the Prey series - CERTAIN PREY.  Much like Eyes of Prey, this story gives Lucas two antagonists to deal with.  One is a smart, rich, borderline psychopath.  The other is a strong, skilled, borderline sociopath.  Killings happen.  Clues are left.  And the characters match wits...and keep the reader turning the pages.<br />I recommend this book.  It is definately one of the stronger entries in the series.	2001-10-27

For new fans of wrestling or the uninitiated this is an indespensable book that gives a great look at matches of the past.  The price is a bit steep so I'd definately recommend getting it at a large discount price but it does come with two products - book and DVD.<br />THE BOOK - THE GOOD<br />The pictures are outstanding and nicely capture the feel for each of the Wrestlemanias.  The large crowd shots are awesome!  However, it would have been nice to see pictures from all of the matches as I found myself forgetting the names/looks of many of the wrestlers from the 80's.<br />THE BOOK - THE BAD<br />It's not all that indepth.  The main event of each Wrestlemania is covered and for several there is a brief overview of some of the &quot;dark horse&quot; matches.

Goal #1 - Take the core members of the \\"post-Crisis\\" Justice League of America and make them into actual characters.  These being: Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aqua-Man, and Black Canary.  Goal #2 - Tell a fun story that can be intertwined with old JLA stories without rewriting history.<br />IT ACCOMPLISHES BOTH GOALS.<br />Now, many readers may complain at the lack of Superman or Batman in this story.  But let's be honest...we already know plenty about them.  The five core members of the JLA have been around since the 1960's and what do we actually know about their characters?  Not much beyond the stereotypical hero adventures that they were placed into.  Writer Mark Waid does a nice job of fleshing out who these people are.<br />Some key strengths of the twelve chapter (i.e. 12 issue) trade-paperback: The Flash taking the leadership role of the JLA, Aqua-Man's introduction to land-dwelling life, Black Canary's continual acknowledgement of the JSA and her possible relationship with The Flash, a great villain conspiracy that works well into the JLA mythos and does not overtly change anything that fans may already know about the team.<br />Sometimes retrospect storylines don't work because we (as readers) already know what becomes of these characters.  However, sometimes they are just a fun read that can remind us about our love for the history of the heroes and their team and what we miss in today's comic book environment.  I recommend JLA - Year One and I also believe that Brave & The Bold - Flash and Green Lantern makes an excellent sequel of sorts.<br />CHECK THEM OUT HERO FANS!	2001-09-02

THE PUNISHER IS COOL AGAIN!<br />Garth Ennis has done the near impossible.  He has salvaged a character that looked to be doomed because of poor decision making and bad writers.  Can anyone remember anything worthwhile from the Punisher in the last 10 years?  WELL NOW YOU CAN!<br />With Welcome Back, Frank, Ennis reintroduces the character without merely \\"forgetting\\" his past adventures.  The history is there and is acknowledged.  Once that's done Ennis unleashes the Punisher on the world of crime.  To talk about the violence and the methods to the madness would deprive the reader of the sheer \\"Fun of the Ride.\\"<br />So instead I'd like to comment on why The Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank succeeds where so many previous attempts have failed.  First, strong villains - Garth Ennis knows that when The Punisher encounters a criminal...one of them will die.  Thus he develops a series of creative and strong antagonists that we (as readers) want to see get their \\"comeuppance\\".  Ma Gnucci is truly one of the most vicious villains I've encountered in a long time.  Second, a great supporting cast - The Punisher lives in an apartment building with some truly wonderful characters.  The kind of people who can only exist in a comic book...and yet we begin to bond with them...and more surprisingly they bond with Frank...and shockingly he bonds with them!  To see The Punisher grow as a character is a very rewarding moment.<br />Welcome Back, Frank also gives the reader some of the most memorable comic book moments in a long long time.  Whether it's a weaponless Frank avoiding hitmen through the New York Zoo (oh yes...people will be dying here), or the powerful Russian beating The Punisher with his own toilet, or The Vigilante Squad seeking out their idol...it's all here.<br />Garth Ennis through his work with the fantastic Preacher series and here with the rebrith of The Punisher has truly proven to be a voice of the new dawn of comic books.	2001-08-17

You do not need to be interested in the sport of climbing to get hours of reading enjoyment from these stories.<br />The tales are brief and obviously real (some are too stupid to have been merely thought up).  A few examples: the couple that have sex in a hammock at 3,000 feet...and end up hanging naked from their ankles after the hammock rips, the 400 Lbs. rabbi who climbs up halfway and then decides it is time to rapidly return to the ground...and the poor belayer who is not ready for the &quot;weight&quot; of the matter, and the climber who plummets off of a mountain only to have his rope ensnare in a tree and save his life...mere feet from the ground.<br />The stories will make you smile and maybe even laugh out loud.  A nice bonus is the inclusion of a Commentary follow-up and a Prevention Tip at the end of each narrative.<br />So keep both feet on the ground and leave the perilous and often entertaining climbing to the wacky, wild, and way way too stupid!	2001-08-17

Ian Gittler makes that point painfully clear in the very early passages of his coffee-table book Pornstar.  Unfortunately once we have gained this knowledge there is not much more we can learn from our brief touches with the lives of the stars.<br />The Good - Gittler does a nice job of interviewing a wide range of stars and starlets.  Everyone from Nina Hartley to Sharon Mitchell to Joey Silvera to Jon Dough to Tom Byron to many many more.  His pictures are fine...some even haunting.  My mind always comes back to a photo of one starlet who is on set and desperately looking through the lights to meet her boyfriends' eyes...even when she still has &quot;business at hand&quot; with an unknown partner.<br />The Bad - Gittler is still an outsider and just doesn't have enough skill to ask the tough questions or to find the motivation in the lives of the stars.  A lot of time was also devoted to Savannah (who the author is obviously enamoured with).  I myself was more curious about the pictures of several stars who received no mention in the actual text...people like Victoria Paris, Asia Carerra, or Lisa Lipps who have nice photos but beyond that we learn nothing of their lives both in-and-out of the world of adult cinema.  And there are numerous big-name adult stars who don't get so much as a reference.<br />There is a large percentage of people who are both interested and fascinated by the world of adult movies.  Raw Talent by Jerry Butler does a better job of providing some perspective into this field (albeit from one person's point of view).  Hopefully in the near future we'll get a book that allows us entry into the lives of the stars...and digs a little deeper than what we can merely see with our eyes.	2001-08-17

I have been a fan of Spiderman since the early 1970s.  In fact I practically grew up alongside Peter Parker.  I've seen the character through plenty of ups (The Death of Gwen Stacy, Untold Tales of Spiderman) and downs (Spiderman 2099, the Howard Mackie years). So naturally, it was with great trepidation that I finally decided to read the new &quot;take&quot; on him that was presented in Power and Responsibility.  I could not imagine the fun ride that was in store for me.<br />Writers Bill Jemas and Brian Michael Bendis do an unbelievable job of keeping the beloved characters and elements that fans will know and love.  But, at the same time they create just enough of a twist to keep readers intrigued and guessing as to what they will experience next.  A perfect example is the character of Uncle Ben who is fully developed and around long enough to establish a strong relationship between himself and Peter.  Readers have plenty of time to enjoy Uncle Ben while at the same time dreading the fate that they know will unfold around him.  The death of Uncle Ben is the prime motivation for the entire character of Spiderman...and yet I liked Ben so much I hoped that this time around perhaps he'd live.<br />The Ultimate Spiderman storyline also does a nice job of fleshing out the origin of Spiderman and his nemesis The Green Goblin (who is incredibly different).  Interwoven between the characters several familiar faces also fall.  I can't wait to see the Ultimate version of Doctor Octopus or to see how the character of Harry Osborn develops do to what occurs in this intial storyarc.<br />Finally why should you read Ultimate Spiderman: Power and Responsibility?  Bottom line - IT IS FUN.  You'll have a chance to see a modern take on a classic hero and to watch as he grows, experiences the troubles of being a teenager, the challenges of being a newborn superhero, and as he learns that &quot;with great power comes great responsibility.&quot;	2001-08-17

Being a middle school teacher I try to keep up to date on books aimed for younger readers.  As I was browsing through the bookstore I came across The Three Investigaors series.  WOW! TALK ABOUT A BLAST FROM THE PAST!<br />I recalled (back in the late 70's) reading a few of these stories involving the three teens and their mystery solving cases dealing with mummies, sharks, and scarecrows.  Of their partnership with Alfred Hitchcock and their secret headquarters buried in a salavage yard.  But, would their adventures be as fascinating to a grown up?<br />The answer (as I briefly pinch my lip) is - YES!  I'm happy to say that Jupiter Jones, Pete Crenshaw, and Bob Andrews have held up remarkably well over the years.  Granted Mr. Hitchcock is now referred to as Reginald Clarke, but everything else remains the same just a fun-filled mystery.  The Secret of Terror Castle does a nice job of starting off the series and introducing readers to the characters and their exploits.<br />Anyone who grew up with Scooby Doo will love these books.  As an educator I also strongly recommend them for parents who are looking for books to get their young boys interested in reading.<br />For anyone (of any age) that is looking for more to young-literature than Harry Potter, the Hardy Boys, or the Wolrds of Narnia...then The Three Investigaors series will be a great discovery!	2001-08-16

Told in 12 chapters, the story takes a bit of time to unfold and new readers will need a while to familiarize themselves with all of the characters. But once these two areas are handled...get ready for a fun ride.<br />It's impossible to describe the depth of this story. What other writers would present as a simple battle between government soldiers and a race of super-powered beings...Paul Jenkins pulls so much more from. There is slavery, penance, insanity, forgiveness, shame, understanding, heroism, loyalty, blind loyalty, manipulation, emancipation, love, and then there is family.<br />What makes The Inhumans work so well beyond the immense story is the uniqueness of the characters. The race of inhumans each have their own individuality expressed in their dialogue, their actions, and most powerfully in their appearence. What we might view as deformed...they would view as beautiful...two worlds that meet through a mirror (a symbol that is touched upon in the narrative). Pages could be written about these characters but then that would spoil the read and discovery so I'll confine mine to two characters.<br />TRITON - In what is probably the strongest chapter of the book, this character reflects back on his witnessing of the sinking of the Lusitania. It was his first encounter with humans in a positive light and lead him to think and rethink his thoughts on these creatures of a different race. The paintings of Triton standing on the decks of the Lusitania in present day are haunting.<br />BLACK BOLT - The king of the Inhumans who is not permitted to speak because his vocal cords can decimate mountains. He is also not permitted thought balloons because that would rob the character of so much. With the powerful king we have a character that will make you think. The weight of his people rests on his shoulders, and because of his complete lack of dialogue we are kept in the dark as to his motivations just as his closest family members are. Here is a character that could not exist in any other medium save the realm of the comic book (graphic novel to the elite). I found myself staring at every panel with this wonderful character present. The embrace between brothers Black Bolt and 'Mad' Maximus was especially gripping.<br />All in all I can not praise Inhumans enough. It has a creative energy that helps it stand apart from the typical superhero storyline. Much like each citizen of Attilan, there will never be another story like Inhumans.<br />Will you love it on the first read? Maybe not. Will you think about it when it's all over...definately.

He combined new elements with elements from the classic TV show.  He developed characters and action pieces that carried weight.  And he made reading Galactica like visiting an old friend.  As a fan I could not have enjoyed these two books more.<br />Then I picked up the third Battlestar Galactica book RESURRECTION....<br />This time Hatch is writing with Stan Timmons and they're fighting a losing battle.  Somewhere along the line they tossed out 90% of the work that was done in the first two novels.  Characters that had relationships...no longer have them.  Characters that were alluded to being in relationships...are suddenly back at Square #1.  And characters that plot and schemed in earlier books...suddenly act dumbfounded and lost.  Exactly how I felt as I worked my way through the 277 pages...DUMBFOUNDED AND LOST!<br />I have so many questions that were thrown off by this poorly written and poorly edited book that I don't know where to begin.<br />Did the editor own a spell checking program? Did the author(s) bother thinking about the first two novels? Didn't Apollo and Sheba almost get married in the earlier books? Haven't we seen a character \\"almost\\" die 90,000 time by now? Didn't Count Iblis and Baltar work and scheme together? Didn't Athena and Starbuck already live together? Is any character allowed to permanently grow besides Apollo? How exciting can antagonists be when they are reintroduced 250 pages into a story?  Isn't the third book in a trilogy supposed to END all of the storylines?<br />And let's not even talk about the cliched \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" hint at the end of the story.<br />Trust me on this.  I LOVED the first two Galactica books.  They may be bubble-gum science fiction...but compared to this mess they read like LITERATURE.	2001-08-03

After 184 pages you'll quickly decide that all you're in for is a life of worry...and a quickly diminishing bank account.<br />The Getaway tells the story of Doc and Carol McCoy and how they have robbed a bank with just over $200,000 and are attempting to flee the country.  Of course along the way they have to escape the police, fellow henchman out to kill them, petty thieves, and numerous problems that they could never have predicted.  The two work together because they are in love and know that as a team they CAN succeed.  Which leaves us to their final destination the town of EL REY, where it is made painfully clear - if you want to survive you need to look out for #1.  What will become of our beloved protagonists?  Well Good Reader go and discover this for yourselves.  Here you will find a simple tale of escape that turns shockingly into a study in ethics.  To say The Getaway is a fast and exciting read would be an understatement.<br />Characters in this story are portrayed very realisticaly.  I continually come back to a 48-hour stretch where Carol McCoy is forced to sleep in a cramped watery cave that is so narrow she can't even turn around.  The claustrophobia leaps off of the page!  Jim Thompson's books have stayed in publication for decades for a reason.  This is classic crime noir and it is highly recommended.<br />On a closing side note - For movie fans out there I also recommend Quentin Tarantino's FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN on DVD.  In the audio commentary Tarantino comments on The Getaway and how he incorporated the setting of El Rey into his movie.  It's a fun look at a celebrity's appreciation of this novel.	2001-07-17

The Wolf's Hour is the 6th book by McCammon that I have read and like many readers I passed it by for years because the plot seemed a little too bizarre for me.  How cool can a werewolf book set in World War II be?  And finally in 2001 I discovered the answer...VERY VERY COOL!<br />McCammon tells the story of Michael Gallatin in two parts.  Part one deals with the early years of werewolf life and addresses the myth/fact areas of the legend that will be necessary for the novel.  Part two is sheer action as Gallatin goes on a mission deep into Nazi Germany.  The stories are told concurrently and intertwine throughout the novel.  The book is a study in duality - good vs. evil, man vs. wolf, action vs. horror...and through it all we are left to ponder the question, &quot;What is the werewolf in the eyes of God?&quot;<br />As with his other excellent novels They Thirst, Stinger, and Blue World, McCammon provides a strong protagonist and more importantly an equal antagonist.  The Wolf's Hour gives us three villains that the hero must deal with: Colonel Jerek Blok, his muscular henchman &quot;Boots&quot;, and big-game hunter Harry Sandler.  Waiting for these characters to meet and battle really made the read even more compelling.  McCammon starts the ride in motion on Page 1 and takes us through more suspense and action than we could get at any theme park.  The book is sheer KINETIC ENERGY.  And, just like the cliff-hangers of yesteryear, McCammon puts our hero into numerous perils in every single chapter. Whether it is battling a Berzerker wolf in the forest, fighting off Nazi's on the roof of the Paris opera house, struggling for survival in a Nazi death camp, or battling a vicious hunter on board a literal locomotive death-trap, we are continually asking ourselves &quot;How will the hero get out of this one?&quot;<br />The Wolf's Hour is the best book that I have read this year and it is a sad commentary that McCammon gave up being a professional author.  I strongly recommend that you do the leg work and dig up as many of his works as you can...you won't be disappointed with the ride.is a sad commentary that McCammon gave up being a professional author.

Now, in defense of author Greg Bear, it is a well written novel with some very creative and original concepts.  Mr. Bear does what he can to introduce new aliens and to incorporate some characters and conepts that we (as Star Wars fans) love.  The chapters dealing with General Tarkin were the strongest in the book (here is a character who can be quite fascinating).  But let's be honest until Episode 2 comes out...the characters of Anakin and Obi-Wan aren't going to come across anything \\"life changing\\".<br />So, if you're going through withdrawl from the Galaxy Far, Far Away...then pick this book up and read it.  But, if you're reading to be moved by something \\"grand and huge and exploding with excitement\\"...well there are plenty of other sci-fi books ....	2001-05-13

From cover to cover this book has tons of: trivia, answers to the inane, and things that you've probably heard before but forgot all about it.<br />Anyone who has any allusions of trying to get on a TV trivia show (like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire) will definately want to familiarize themself with the writings of Uncle John.  It's helped me expand my knowledge base greatly.

I have been a big fan of Steve Alten's books MEG and THE TRENCH so I dove into DOMAIN ready for an exciting tale.  In the first 250 pages or so Alten does not disappoint.  The amount of research in the novel is astounding. I loved the fact that I didn't know what was real and what had been &quot;doctored&quot; for the sake of the storyline.  Alten mixes in research, the journal of explorer scientist Julius Gabriel, and the adventures of Michael Gabriel together nicely to keep the story moving at a staggering pace.  The scenes involving Michael in the asylum (and the potential for escape) were my favorites.<br />So why only 2 Stars?  Well...Domain takes a serious stumble in the last 50 pages or so.  What started off as a great storyline devloves into a series of cliches that if you read or watch movies you will be able to identify all too easily:  nuclear war (aborted at the last second), a giant monster that is very 'B' Movie-like in description, dream sequences (do people ever dream like this in the real world), and a climax that leaves a lot to be desired.  After all of his adventures, when the main character reaches the ending...he basically just stumbles around and lets others guide him along, it certainly would have been nice to see the portagonist handle something on his own.  The antagonists are also let off way too easily in this novel, robbing the reader of the &quot;pay-off&quot;.  By the way, why is it that characters in books or movies always have twins when they are impregnated...after that one-time only romantic encounter?  Of course, these same parents also have that special &quot;mental bond&quot; with said progeny.  Oh yeah, and the story doesn't end here...or at all.  Instead we end with a sequel blurb on the last page.  That really robs you of any feelings of completion.<br />Kudos for Mr. Alten for all of the work he put into this story (especially the first 250 pages), and hopefully in the future he'll avoid the easy ending and the highway to clicheville and give us an original ending worthy of his efforts.icheville and give us an original ending worthy of his efforts.	2001-03-25

I should prefice this by saying that this volume is still better than 90% of the comics out there.  Robinson's writing is in the top echelon of the industry and he's doing some neat things with the development of the character of Jack Knight.  So, where does this TPB stumble...VILLAINS!  Jack (Starman) isn't given a strong antagonist in any of his adventures in this volume.  The best villain MIST has a stand alone storyline (which is quite good) but Starman needs someone to battle to help him further become the hero that he is capable of being.<br />This aside, Infernal Devices does have several strong points.  The annual 'Talking with David' story is the best to this point.  The relationship with Jack and his father (Ted) is still a strong central point for all of the STARMAN ADVENTURES.  And, it's always nice to see Jack in over his head when surrounded by heroes like Batman and Sentinel.  I hope future stories will just provide a stronger motivation and supervillain to keep things more hectic.  Read Starman: Infernal Devices and then go and reread Starman: A Wicked Inclination to see how GREAT this character can be when confronted by a true menace.	2001-03-18

However, I have only encountered his excellent prose twice: in the superb science fiction thriller FAHRENHEIT 451 (a must read) and here in the pages of SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES.  After these entertaining reads, I need to familiarize myself with more of his work.<br />As for the book, Something Wicked is a story that every child (especially young boys) can relate to.  It's the story of friendship and indeed best friends, the story of an evil carnival that gives people what they desire...but at what price, and the bond between fathers and sons.  Truly the monsters in this book practically leap off of the page - the dust witch really creeped me out.  The tattooed Mr. Dark is an evil classic and the confrontation between him and the main characters in the depths of the library is a page-burner (and made me remember the creepy feeling I used to get in librarys).<br />If you are not familiar with this story...READ IT NOW!  And, where this story cries out to the joys of youth and childhood, I feel I should also recommend BOY'S LIFE by Robert R. McCammon which in many ways is a reflection on this story...the two would definately make excellent book ends.	2001-02-17

Too often his books are overlooked, but McCammon has  a powerful story-telling style and can produce and action scene like  nobody's business.<br />STINGER is one of McCammon's finer works.  It tells  the story of a small desert town where two aliens have landed.  One a  peaceful energy being...the other a deadly bounty-hunter.  The town  characters are introduced...the town is sealed off from the world by an  energy field...AND THE STINGER IS TURNED LOOSE!<br />Where it might not keep  you shaking in fear, this book will deliver so much action that the last  200 pages fly by with kinetic force that few authors can achieve.<br />So  where do we stand?  McCammon is not as frightening as King.  He's more  logical and fast-paced than Koontz.  And he should not be overlooked for  the fine novels he's turned out.<br />I also recommend Robert R.

This seems to be the  overlooked 'gem' of the man-eating swimming monster genre.<br />I first came  across this book in 1993 (while waiting in a movie theatre parking lot to  see Lethal Weapon 3...never made the movie).  The &quot;super-smart&quot;  shark angle is really exciting and the fact that they hunt in a pack makes  it even more deadly for all the characters who find themselves more than  ankle deep in water.<br />I can't spoil things but lets just say, there's a  terrific build-up, nice characterization, and an action-packed finale.  If  it takes you more than 2 days to finish this book...then you need to take a  swim with the sharks.  :)<br />Oh yeah, as my friend and I often say...you  can't go scuba diving with a camera and not immediately shudder when an  incredibly vivid visual scene from this book jumps into your mind!<br />Buy  this book...and read it on the safety of the beach.<br />CHOMP!	2000-08-15

With TV and movies it's easy but  when was the last time you laughed and cried from reading a book?  This  book will make you do it!  It's a testament to how stupid people are that  they actually respond to the letters of Ted L. Nancy (which go from strange  to bizarre to absurd).<br />Some of my favorites:<br />Ted's letter to the owner  of Norm's Barbershop where he says he'll be opening his own barbershop next  door and calling it GNORM'S BARBERSHOP.  Will this be a problem?<br />Writing  to a wildlife park and telling the rangers he'll be studying the grizzly  bears in full bear costume.  &quot;If a bear waves and says 'Hello' it'll  probably be me.&quot;<br />A letter to a poetry contest with his submission  &quot;OH HOW I HATE POETRY CONTESTS&quot;!<br />The sheer ingenuity of these  letters kept me cracking up...sometimes I'd be laughing just to see which  business or country Mr. Nancy would target next.  The laughs come page  after page and I can't recommend this book more highly.	2000-08-03

There's nothing too in depth, and the characters are  only slightly deeper than those in say Jurassic Park.  Now, this may sound  like a bad thing, but this book kept me reading and left me thoroughly  entertained the entire time.  It doesn't have the sheer kinetic energy of  Rovin's last book VESPERS (which I highly recommend) but it does have a  better conflict.<br />In FATALIS, you have two sides - Sheriff Gearhart who is  looking to safe human life at any cost and Jim Grand who wants to save the  &quot;returned&quot; Sabre-tooth cats.  Obviously one is HERO and one is  ANTAGONIST, however as I read this I found myself taking strange sides.  It's a tough thing to follow a 'hero' who seems more preoccupied with  saving an animal than with all of the innocents who are being slaughtered  around him...and believe me there is a HUGE body count in this book.<br />All  in all I'd say buy Fatalis, read it, and wait for the movie...which if  Hollywood was smart...will be made!	2000-08-03

To be honest, I wanted to read FATALIS but couldn't wait for it to be published.  So I bought Vespers to familiarize myself with Mr. Rovin.  WOW!  I tore through this book faster than the bats tearing through their  victims.  A great summer read that'll keep you turning pages in excitement  (and may even make you brush your hands through your hair a couple of  times).  Sure it's sci-fi and deals with giant monsters.  But it's a FUN  READ!  Do yourself a favor and get this book!	2000-07-31
