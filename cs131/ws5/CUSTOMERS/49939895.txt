US	49939895	R1ZV4PEKL5BGWW	0915864258	834741547	The Land of Green Ginger	Books	2	2	7	N	N	One of the most depressing books I've ever read.	The first point to make is that this is NOT the wonderful children's book by the same title by Noel Langley.  If you are looking for that great children's fantasy book, please see the book with ISBN 057121083X.<br /><br />Now, for Ms. Holtby's novel.  It is a story of a woman at the turn of the century who is caught running a farm to support her husband who has tuberculosis and her two daughters.  She is constantly thinking that she should be somewhere else, namely in Africa or some other wondrous lands having adventures.  She misses what she calls \\"the land of green ginger\\".<br /><br />The life of Joanna, the main character is quite boring until foreigners move in next door and one of them becomes a boarder at her house.  There he tells her the story of his horribly depressing life, which is followed by a semi-romance under the eye of a jealous and sick husband.<br /><br />The ending is supposedly \\"happy\\" but only after lots of people are hurt deeply.  I am not sure why this novel gets praise for depicting Joanna's \\"spirit\\" or \\"charm\\".  I found the character to be clumsy and the plot rather uninteresting.  It is a story of wishes not fulfilled and it leaves you with a depressed feeling of longing for something else (possibly a different novel).<br /><br />I am quite sure this novel would not be getting as much attention if it had not shared a title with the great book by Noel Langley.	2005-01-03
US	49939895	R3NXWHJBPT72TL	0380798271	315455376	Commitment Hour	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Really enjoyable, character-driven sci-fi.	This is James Alan Gardner's early work - unlike his Expendable series, it does not feature Festina Ramos, however, the League of Peoples is briefly mentioned. <br /> <br />The basic plot for this novel is that Earth around the 24th-25th century faces a catastrophe (overpopulation, disease, etc.) and the League of Peoples offers Earthlings a way out - those who so want can leave the planet and live among aliens learning their technology and cultural standpoints.  Not everyone leaves and those who stay are left without the support of a developed civilization and the world ends up resembling that of the Middle Ages with a history (and therefore artifacts) of modern and futuristic science.  At some point, those who left the Earth decide to come back and conduct social experiments using extremely advanced technology. <br /> <br />One of these experients is a little village whose inhabitants change gender every year up until they are 20, when having experienced being both a man and a woman during their lifetime, they decide to become one permanently.  The twist is that in addition to become male or female, one can choose to become a Neut - a person of both genders.  Thankfully though, even though the plot revolves around changing genders, the emphasis of the novel is more on great technology, a society that has leaped quickly forward and then rapidly backwards, and the politics of people in such a situation.  The main character is very believable and his (her?) adventures make for a page-turner. <br /> <br />The atmosphere of this novel was similar to that of Trapped - it even features the Spark Lords.  My biggest hangup about reading this novel, even though I loved all of other novels by James Alan Gardner, was that its description does not really indicate that the novel is set in the same universe as the others.  I was very pleasantly surprised and The Commitment Hour was a fast read.  The ending was somewhat surprising and definitely not cliche. <br /> <br />I give it5 stars among Gardner's books, and 4 overall.  I recommend it highly for the author's fans.	2004-10-22

Presumably, this collection of mathematical puzzles is for fans of one Dr. Ecco whose life is full of adventures.  For people not familiar with the character, the book appears very dull and the characters contrived, uninteresting, and, well, kind of lame.  The narration is a little over the top, but all in all, the book is not terribly written.<br />The puzzles on the other hand are pretty interesting.  Ranging from solving codes through organizing buildings in space to transporting monkeys, the puzzles are a nice way of teaching mathematical concepts.  As the descriptions of the puzzles and Dr. Ecco's solutions thereof progress, the reader is asked to participate on different levels in solving of the puzzles.  Cybernovices and cyberexperts can learn about math in a fun way.<br />I recommend this book for those interested in solving puzzles of any kind who are not detered by corny storylines.  If you are not sure whether you'd like this book, I recommend you flip through it at a book store to make sure.	2004-06-11

As a big fan of Little Lit 1 and Little Lit 2, I found <i>It Was A Dark And Silly Night</i> to be a little disappointing.  I am not sure where the disappointment comes from - the art is great (kudos especially to Richard Sala and Martin Handford), the stories are interesting (my favorite being the Yeti story by Lemony Snicket), and the editing is superb.  It may be that the charm of the first two compilations was that even though they pretended to contain children stories, Little Lit 1 & 2 were really for the adults' entertainment.  The humor in Little Lit 1 & 2 was not pressured or artificially created, instead, the humor rose naturally out of the contrast between having children's stories and directing them at adults, between illustrating as if you were illustrating for kids and realizing that the story being illustrated actually contains a lot of more mature humor with more literary tricks and irony.<BR><br />Little Lit 3 is proving to be a little too silly - it's nice to see your kids read the book, but Little Lit 1 & 2 were books you could read with your kids without being bored, or even read if you didn't have any kids at all.  <i>It Was A Dark And Silly Night</i> is still a well-written, well-drawn, and well-edited compilation, however, the fact that it is purposefully directed at a younger audience makes it somewhat unreachable even for the most immature and young-hearted of adults.<BR><br />I'm still glad I have purchased this compilation as it is a nice compliment to the first two books, but it is definitely a sequel and were it the first book in the series, the series might've never become as popular as it is currently.	2003-09-22

From anime lovers to those who preach of Japanese traditions (more often than not without knowing much about them), it is hard to find an objective and yet an entertaining view of modern Japan.<BR><br />Here's where Isaac Adamson doesn't disappoint.  In his character, Billy Chaka, an American journalist working for a teen magazine finding stories in Tokyo, Adamson combines a strong lead character who doesn't take himself too seriously while remaining a kick-bum (literally) smart mouth.  In this installation of the Billy Chaka adventures, Billy pursues a mysterious geisha, finding a weird conspiracy full of what works best in mystery novels: personal tragedy, greed, and of course, dark secrets.  Billy Chaka, one of the few gaijin speaking fluent Japanese has an easy time infiltrating the Japanese culture, but even he can manage to get in trouble before solving the mystery (and even that only partially).  <BR><br />This is a fast-read novel, entertaining and engaging.  It does not glorify the Japanese (nor any other) culture, but neither does it condemn it nor patronize it.  Most of the characters are very well developed and work well with the plot.  It is a good book, and an excellent beginning of a series.  I highly recommend it.	2003-08-15

Maybe I'm just getting old (depressing as it is), but I am not sure I get this series.  I love the Narnia Chronicles, books by Astrid Lindgren, and good series such as the Harry Potter books.  The combination made Amazon recommend me this series, and surely, the reviews were favorable enough, so I got these books.  <br />Unfortunately, I'm disappointed.  Even though the writing is pretty good and the story is not trite, the idea of wizards based on the Merlin myth and the legend of King Arthur is kind of weak.  There's danger in the books and puzzles to be solved, but they're neither exciting nor interesting, and at some points, even seem to be cliches.  I may be overly harsh in this review, but I strongly suspect that The Dark Is Rising Sequence is just simply a young adult novel that doesn't grow with the person and is not at all appropriate for those beyond adolescence.  This series might be good for a range between 3rd and 7th grade for kids who like fantasy books.  I recommend it to them, but you jaded adults, steer away from this novel.	2003-08-15

While Idea Index provides actual ides for nice graphical renderings, the layout index is very simple and very scarce when it comes to layout ideas.  It has a limited number of sample ideas which only look good due to the images present in the layout.  The layouts provided don't really add much to the presentation of the information in the examples.  Also, the web layouts are especially horrendous - despite looking semi-pretty, they do not consider at all the medium (e.g. giant images take longer to load, etc.).  I was pretty disappointed by this book after liking Idea Index so much.  <BR><br />Overall, the book is so-so.  Going through it at a library will give you all the layout ideas this book could ever provide - there's no need to keep it on your shelf for future reference.  If you're looking for good, or at least original print layout ideas, you better look elsewhere.	2003-08-15

An ice-cream maker is an excellent tool to have in your kitchen.  You can make such weird ice cream as black pepper vanilla ice cream, peach frozen yogurt, or even spinach sorbet.  However, as neat as these choices sound and as entertaining they may be, &quot;weird&quot; just doesn't do for ice cream if the ice cream is not flavorful.  <BR><br />Here's where The Ultimate Ice Cream Book is more than helpful.  From the simple recipes for ice cream cones to the explanations how ice cream should be made, what is Philadelphia style ice cream, and how to keep your eggs from clouding for regular ice cream, the book is a must if you have an ice cream maker.  It provides hundreds of recipes with a lot of flavor and imagination.  One of my favorite parts of the book is that each recipes has variations, so if you are concerned about certain ingredients because of a diet, allergies, or just personal choice, it is more than easy to still make excellent ice cream while avoiding what you don't like.  Almost every recipe is accompanied by the egg-less Philadelphia style ice cream (which are faster to make), and every recipe has basic explanations what to do, so you don't have to keep flipping through the book while you're cooking.<BR><br />Every single recipe I have used from this book yielded delicious ice cream.  I highly recommend it.	2003-08-15

Tony Mendoza photographs his cat Ernie as Ernie is simply being a cat of his own.  The photographs show exactly how cats are, without the cheesiness or patronizing cuteness.<BR><br />Ernie's definitely a cat with character.  I own two cats that bear similar markings to Ernie's and I only wish a skilled photographer such as Tony Mendoza would document their lives.  Even if you don't like cats, the photography is astounding without being pretentious.  <BR><br />It is a great book to read to your cats at bedtime.	2003-08-15

So much darker and so much more involved.  J. K. Rowling definitely does not disappoint as she lays a path for what may be a conflict like none before in the Harry Potter series.  Someone dies, but Harry seems to gain more followers.  The characters grow up and face even more problems.  The Goblet of Fire and The Order of the Phoenix are both suspenseful and like the Empire Strikes Back of the series - with a terrifying cliffhanger at the end.  <BR><br />This book shows that J. K. Rowling is way past just simple book writing for kids.  This is a great novel that can involve anyone.<BR><br />Rating: Excellent.  Highly recommended to anyone.	2003-06-24

For some reason, this book was assigned to one of my intro to comp-sci classes.  It definitely does not fit such profile as it provides a great overview of the language, how it's built, how it works, and its applications, however, it does not teach to program.  If you already know the basics of programming and are proficient in a similar language (e.g. Java), this may be an interesting read to understand the workings of the C language, but by no means expect it to provide little &quot;classes&quot; to teach you to be a C programmer.<BR><br />Good overview of the language, targetted at more advanced programmers.	2003-04-04

Not unlike the other titles in the Spectrum series, Spectrum 9 provides a great overview of contemporary fantastic art, the best emerging artists, new trends, and samples of the forever-loved art.  The artwork is much better documented with sources listed for further study of fantastic art.  <BR><br />If you've ever admired a cover on a sci-fi book, cool credits in a fantasy movie, or even action figures of your favorite super heroes, this book might be for you.  The nice thing about the Spectrum series is that you do not need to reach for a specific volume to look at specific form of art.  Each volume offers a pretty even and ,personally I think, good cross section of the current fantastic art and design.	2003-04-04

First, it offers a comprehensive overview of the Weight Watchers philosophy outlining the POINTS system and the basics of nutrition.  After the intro, you get a whole lot of good recipes ranging from those suitable for a single person to eating for a while family.  It is organized by meat type (no fears, it does have a vegetarian section) and has a handy index of recipes.  Each recipe is broken down to show you how many points are contained in the servings.   For all recipes, each takes up at most one page, so you don't have to flip through pages mid-cooking.  The book is spiral bound (comb bound for the cheaper version), which makes it very easy to use in the kitchen.<BR><br />One of the nice things about this book is that it stresses the importance of using herbs and spices in your food, making the food pretty interesting and appetizing.  Most recipes are concocted from easily found items that are not usually expensive, thus allowing you to lose weight (or just watch it) while saving money and becoming healthier.<BR><br />Highly recommended for the good amount of recipes, ease of use, and financial consideration for the chef.	2003-04-04

This is a very thorough account of the practice of medicine in the Middle Ages.  It covers most key points such as humors, blood-letting, women healers, hospitals, the role of religion in medicine, the taboos regarding medicine and other topics.  It is greatly documented for further research and I recommend it highly to anyone interested in the topic, especially that it is written in a rather approachable and enjoyable fashion.

Baudolino is a story of a habitual liar whose lies get him in and out of the most outlandish type of trouble imaginable.<BR><br />Monsters, creatures, cities to conquer!  Battles, crazy emperors, artifacts!  These are just a very few parts of Bauodolino's adventures.  In a way, this novel is even better than Eco's famous The Name of the Rose as it covers the medieval world and its myths in a broader and more lighthearted way, mostly amusing the writer while taking from the world of mythology, mysticism, history, and politics.  <BR><br />Eco is a great creator of powerful characters with whom we laugh and cry in the novels.  Baudolino despite his habits is a thoroughly likeable characters and regardless of his lies, even he once in a while offers valuable advice.<BR><br />I plan on re-reading this novel many times for I am sure that I have missed on many intricacies that Eco purposefully put in the novel.  Also, I want to re-read it to once again enjoy the excitement of traveling to the end of the world, speculating how the world is shaped, and planning on visiting the earthly paradise.	2003-03-21

It is hard to write a review of a Lynda Barry novel that would do justice the greatness she puts in her books.  All Barry's characters are full of life and life problems, some more optimistic than others.  The Freddie Stories is a collection of comic strips in the same world as The! Greatest! Of! Marlys!  It is much darker than the novel about Marlys and her shining personality.  Although it made me cry at the end at the saddness of humanity (and all cheesy phrases like this), The Freddie Stories is an excellent read, once again dazzling with Barry's art, wit, and humor.  A must read for Lynda Barry's fans.	2003-03-21

Long story short, I didn't like Microserfs back then, the plot seemed underdeveloped the characters shallow and the writing too perky.<BR><br />It was not until I have moved to Seattle, the home of The Beast where I have started to like Microserfs.  It is important to be able to identify with the characters in this novel and therefore I recommend it for most computer professionals, especially those who had the chance to participate in the dotcom era.  It is an enjoyable read, suitable even for those with shortest attention spans as it is written in a form of a diary with entries ranging from 1 sentence to about 10 pages at most.  It's a light-hearted novel and yet it addresses some important points everyone should pay attention to while growing up, mainly existential angst, love, and the &quot;right&quot; priorities.<BR><br />It is a fun book to read.  It's no Shakespeare, but it'll do.	2003-03-21

I've read all of the League of People series by James Alan Gardner and I have to admit that this one is certainly the best written, clearest, and most detailed.  I was most impressed by the fact that Mr. Gardner finally figured out that to emphasize something, he doesn't have to repeat it three three three times.  Instead, the novel is full of excellent descriptions of a post-technology era, where horse-drawn carriages are pulled on 500 year old highways with giant potholes and the main way of communication is mail by land.<BR><br />However, there are flaws in this novel.  I think the primary flaw is the desperate need for tying this novel into the League of People plot.  It would really make a better book to create a whole new universe explaining the agency to protect earth to be controlled by SOME extraterrestials, but not necessarily the League of People.  Sure, the plot twists were great, however, throughout the whole book I felt they were unnecessary.  Also, on a personal note, I would've preferred much more (or even some) space travel, but between the aliens and the magic, I can't complain too much.<BR><br />I don't want to spoil too much for the reader, but the basic premise for the story is a quest that the characters take in order to save a highly powerful psychic able to perform tasks from telekinesis to mind-reading.  They embark on a journey: a fighter, a cleric, a mage, a thief, and a rich guy.  Sounds a bit too much like a Dungeons and Dragons campaign?  Maybe.  But the result is worth reading.  The technology Mr. Gardner puts in the novel mixes very well with the late Middle Ages feel of the everyday life of the characters.  The aliens, as always, are very well-developed, with their quirks and features barely or not at all understood by humans.  There is suspense and mystery and a great cosmic puzzle to be solved.  Fans of Mr. Gardner will be delighted, and those new to his writing, since the novel is very detached from the others, will become addicted.	2002-10-28

Rating: 4<BR><br />So these were the good books of the Stardoc series.  Unfortunately, S. L. Viehl has managed to reduce them into a silly soap opera where the most original characters are moody fiances, the issue at hand is breeding, the technology is so ridiculous, it's not even plausible (even for a sci-fi novel) and the plot is driven by the character's hallucinations.<BR><br />Book IV was sort of readable, mostly due to the mutant characters presented in the novel.  Otherwise, let's just say that space novels should take place in space.<BR><br />Book V ends up a total disappointment.  Cherijo finally finds out what Maggie really has to say to her, which Cherijo finds ridiculous (which is ironic, because the readers will find it even more so) and she says she disapproves of it and people who like control are bad, right?  The novel offers no unifying plot, just a series of insignificant events as in a daytime soap opera.  Sure, there are new planets and new species, but they are executed so poorly, they do not take away from the mediocre effort S. L. Viehl put into this book.<BR><br />Overall, I recommend books 1-3 of the series, they're pretty good sci-fi fluff with strong characters and interesting plots.  Book 4 and 5 are kind of lame and published only because the fans of books 1-3 will buy them.	2002-10-02

Angry White Pyjamas is an excellent account of one person's somewhat extreme experience of Japan.<br /><br />The author of the book, Robert Twigger, an awarded poet from England goes to Japan as means of escaping the boring corporate reality.  In Japan he hopes to find that his life means something.  He begins his experience as an Engish teacher in Japan.  Shortly afterwards, his job is reduced to a part-time, one day per week position.  Poor and disilusioned, living in a cheap apartment with a couple of other random gajins, he finally decides to discover the value of self by signing up for a course in martial arts.<br /><br />Once a member of a dojo, he realizes that he wants to push himself to the extreme limit of his mental and physical ability.  As a result, he signs up for the super-ultra-tough course, usually taken by candidates for the Tokyo riot police.<br /><br />Insanity ensues as he learns martial arts every day for almost 11 months amongst pain, sweat, complaining of fellow students, and constant cultural faux pas.<br /><br />Personally, I'm not sure how accurate is Twigger's descriptionon of the fighting, the food, and the cultural differences, but one must admit that whatever he writes, it is written in the most excellent style.  Twigger keeps an eye out for details in the Japanese lifestyles and describes them from the point of view of an overly enthusiastic yet naive foreigner.<br /><br />The account of the training keeps the reader constantly wondering whether Twigger will be able to finish the course.  After all, the pain, the unfriendliness, and seemintly little payback seem overwhelming.<br /><br />This book is not only for martial arts fans nor fans of the Japanese culture.  I am only slightly interested in these topics, however, I found the book very engaging.  It may not be accurate, but it is an excellent piece of literature, clever, and highly entertaining.ing.	2002-02-01

This book is somewhat a cure for your boredom.  The main storyline of Stardoc revolves around a genetically engineered heroine phycician.  The heroine practices medicine in a colony full of various aliens.  This premise allows for random fictional science, which is great (those of you disagreeing with the science in the book obviously miss the point that this is a science-FICTION book).  We learn about the insides of very weird aliens as well as their psyches.  The author provides almost enough of alien life to satisfy the tastes of sci-fi readers, however, while reading the book, I wished she'd focus more one one or two species of aliens and describe their physiques/habits more thoroughly.  <BR><br />Alas, the book is interesting with a plot engaging enough for a person not to feel that the book is dragging.  I actually wanted to see how it ends and not realizing that the book is the first one in the series, I've been tricked into having to buy the following installments.<BR><br />Although bearing an extremely pacifist message, the book doesn't take itself too seriously, which is very nice and quite uncommon in this genre.  As examples, we have the cliche (but entertaining) beaming of passangers into an alien spaceship and references to cult series with things like holodecks from Star Trek.<BR><br />Overall, this is a pretty good book as far as sci-fi goes.  It's an enjoyable read and I think many a sci-fi fan will enjoy reading it.	2002-01-21

As usual, the novel is filled with interesting aliens and mind-boggling technology that makes no sense, but fits the plot oh so perfectly.  <br /><br />Overall, this is not a book representing heights of <BR>literature, but then again, who reads sci-fi in order to appreciate allegories, alliterations, rhytms, patterns, etc?  This book is a thoroughly enjoyable read - great for the story, interesting new aliens, totally alien technology (which, if a bit implausible, totally adds to the alien feeling of the world).  If you've read any of the other Festina Ramos series, this novel is a must for you - otherwise you might miss out on some important concepts.  I admit, the premise that the devil is really a highly developed alien is pretty far-fetched, but I promise, the book is very relaxing and sometimes even funny.	2001-12-12

On other hand, I wonder whether the makers of this book feel like they have to fill up more pages and therefore sometimes go amiss in their choice of good fantasy art.  Nevertheless, this is an excellent collection of works of fantasy (and fantastic) art, especially good as a first step in the exploration of the field.  Those new to the genre might choose the Spectrum series as a beginner's guide to fantasy art and use it as a jumpboard for further research of this creative branch of art.	2001-10-25

However, I've seen much worse coverage of how computers work from mathematical point of view and this textbook definitely deserves at least 4 on a 1-5 scale.<BR><br />In a rather understandable way, Mr. Lewis covers subjects ranging from Sets, Relations, and Languages, through Automata, Context-Free Languages, Turing Machines through NP-Completeness.  The style of writing is rather dry, but it gets the job done if these are the topics that interest you.  I think the best aspect of this book is its small non-intimidating size, allowing the student to think that he or she can actually learn this loathsome stuff.<BR><br />I recommend it only for classes titled Theory of Computation for this is definitely not a novel to read on your vacation.  Good luck, poor students, good luck...	2001-10-20

I purchased this book as to satisfy my fascination with unix-based systems - I mean, after a while cd, mv, and mkdir just won't do anymore. It is an excellent book explaining the intricacies of unix-based systems and the differences between them. It covers topics such as the management of processes and devices, the filesystem, essentials in administrative tools, startup and shutdown, managing users, securing your system from others, automating your work, backups, system resources, even configuring kernels and TCP/IP Network Management. It explains everything in great detail in a way that's clear to understand while making the reader feel good about him/herself.  Even though I didn't end up a system administrator after reading the book, I enjoyed it.	2001-10-20

Little Lit 2 offers stories by famous artists such as Art Spiegelman, Barbara McClintock, and many others.  The stories are original in their plot as well as art form - from monochrome panels to crowded almost iridescent splash pages and complete with mind games, Little Lit 2 is a compelation of stories for young kids as well as their immature at heart parents.  <BR><br />It is a great book to give as a gift due to its exceptional size.  Also, it may prove excellent to read your children before bedtime.  And since it's a book that can be re-read multiple times (there's always something new to discover in it), you can give to your kids and they'll play for hours. <BR><br />I highly recommend it for hardcore comic book fans as well as those who like original stories.	2001-10-20

I'm 1/4th way through just about now and it's definitely earned entertainment, but so far so good.  <br />Better review to come shortly (this is just a place holder reminding me and motivating me to finish this dizzying novel).	2001-08-23

The science students squirming all over the place with their giant textbooks, ideals, and giant egos.  And then there's the dorky main character who bathes regularly, although not often, who uses computers, but not for hacking, and who likes hardcore science - the simple, inorganic chemistry. <br />Obviously, since this is a Neal Stephenson novel, the reader is kept in suspence as an improbable plot of conspiracy develops to almost kill the main character on many occasion while he tries, in his chaotic-good manner, to save the world from itself and corporate America.  We get the typical Neal Stephenson sarcasm, overblown ego of the main character, super-dorky references, and giant explanations of chemical processes (although some may not be accurate, e.g. not all chemical processes are reversible, really - but it's fiction, so what the heck, no?).   <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves hardcore science - not just computer science.  It's perfect for people who do any form of research in chemistry, physics, etc. while utilizing minimal use of computers in their work. <br />Zodiac is great for the early Stephenson novel that it is.  Gold-hearted geeks of all worlds, unite!	2001-08-23

It assumes no computer knowledge other than being able to FTP.  It is straightforward and detailed, but very very limited.  If you are looking for something that will make you learn Perl, rather than just be able to recognize it when you see it, I recommend Learning Perl from the O'Reilly series.  It includes the same basics and much much more.  If you need any ready Perl scripts, you can probably find many online and learn from those. <br />This book is definitely what it is, but do not expect it to be as thorough as the HTML book from the Visual Quickstart Guide series.	2001-08-23

Along with the material presented in class, this book provided great insight into basics of the Asian culture.   <br />This rather heavy book is perfectly organized chronologically and geographically.  It provides great graphical supplement to the study of early Asian art.  Many artifacts are portrayed, most with detailed description of their history and origin.   <br />I enjoyed my class greatly and this book provided great help to understanding Asian art.  If you are a person who prefers visual aids rather than tons of text and would like to learn the basics of Asian art, I highly recommend this book.  The photographs are excellent, and more often then not, actually motivate you to reading the descriptions of the portrayed objects.  This book will not make you an expert on Asian art, but you'll be able to schmooze your way through at pretentious cocktail parties without any effort.	2001-08-23

This is a compelation of poems written by an obviously disturbed youth filled with imaginative, dark but with a sense of humor, and crisp words producing the kind of poetic imagery one would appreciate when feeling lonely or quirky or both. <br />I enjoyed reading the poems - they leave you with a satisfied feeling of incompletion and melancholy.  Great for rainy days, Sundays, and noodle-based breakfasts.  I can't wait to see more works of this promising young (I presume) poet.	2001-07-13

Such statements are made throughout the entire text with no figures upon which to base such assumptions.  The authors insist on the omnipresence of unexplained jargon, vague statements, farfetched metaphors and ambiguous assumptions in order to arrive at a certain point they are failing to make. <br />It is painfully obvious that the authors are not capable of any coherent and/or original thought and in order to fill out the 360 pages of &quot;Urban Fortunes&quot; they heavily rely on recycling and reusing the ideas of others, followed by an extensive 70-page bibliography and a 20-page index.   <br />As an innocent bystander I feel cheated for losing forever the time I spent reading this text, yet I feel that much worse for the unsuspecting undergraduate college students who, according to the back cover, are required to buy this book for their classes.	2001-04-02
US	49939895	R38HKIL2EIJ51T	0451457366	887615419	The Engines of Dawn	Books	1	7	10	N	N	Unimaginative, undeveloped, with 2-D characters.	<br />First of all, this novel should have been a short story, where P. Cook would hand over his idea to someone who can actually write.   <br />The characters are either extremely cliche or have no more than two personality traits.  The space travel is based on bogus science that doesn't even seem plausible (I know this is a sci-fi novel, but many authors have succeeded at presenting a scientific world which makes some sort of sense) in order to finish up to a predictable punchline.  The aliens are either too mysterious to be described at all or are not interesting enough to actually read their descriptions.  The world that is found by the explorers is exactly the same as earth - which leaves me with a question: why read sci-fi if I am to find at best a skewed description of my real world? <br />I usually like novels dealing with space travel and exploration of new worlds and civilizations, but unfortunately, despite the amount of effort I put into giving this book a chance, I cannot say I like it at all.  The style is extremely choppy, things that happen are not explained at all or explained too much, certain characters are not necessary, and the plot doesn't really develop into anything.  You read the back of the book and you know everything you'd like to know about this novel. <br />It almost appears that this novel was written as a description of a grade B sci-fi movie the author could have watched once.  Unfortunately, the methods used to convey emotions, character traits, plot, and the mood are not always to be translated into the written form.  I wish the author better luck next time.  It would really help if he did some sort of research for his book, e.g. come up with plausible technology, make at least outlines for believable characters, and come up with a plot that would drive the novel to some extent. <br />I do not recommend this book to anyone - it'll leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and possibly spoil the fun of sci-fi for you.	2001-02-08

It explains quickly the commands and what to do with them.  VI itself is very counterintuitive, and this little book provides the necessary help to change any file in any way as quickly as you'd like.  I highly recommend it to have next to your computer when you use vi - even hardcore vi users might find its hints useful and figure out new ways of accomplishing certain tasks. <br />The price is a little bit too much for a book this size, and technically you can get all the information about vi commands online, but if you like your computer stuff explained to you on paper, this is it.  Have fun using vi!	2001-02-05

In this book, concepts of file and user management are explained.  Not much detail is provided as to not confuse the reader who has had no previous experience with unix.  Step-by-step instructions let the reader become more familiar and comfortable with the system.  The bottom line is  that this book says what it does - it is a starting guide - if you need any in-depth information about unix, you must seek elsewhere.   <br />The book has some mistakes, but if you have at least half a brain, you will be able to figure out what is wrong.  In addition, you are constantly reassured that if you are using a system with good administrators, there's little to none damage that you could possibly do.  Some parts try to be humorous in its own cute and dorky manner, but the humor is not obnoxious nor imposing.  Overall, the book is a gentle introduction;  it teaches unix without making the reader feel dumb.	2001-02-05

The characters are drawn in a oversimplified manner, yet at the same time, the reader is completely aware of the characteristics of the characters. The art has fine finish, the story line is original, the math formulas are always true and correct, and do not forget to pay attention to the headlines of newspapers read by the characters (e.g. &quot;Cartoonist Marries Supermodel&quot;). <br />Jason, the youngest of the characters is my hero - obnoxious, yet clever.  Peter, a little bit dumb, is a very nice guy.  Paige you just want to slap.   <br />I laugh every time I read this book.  The Works is great to read in one sitting or a little bit at a time.  I highly recommend it to everyone who likes original humor.	2001-02-01

It explains the basic concepts of programming, so if you have previous exerience with Java, you might not find it useful.  On the other hand, if you do not know Java at all, this is a great book to start with - it translates the concepts of programming (loops, conditionals, string treatment, recursion and more importantly: object oriented programming) into Java and explains how to use them effectively.  It is written in a quirky manner that will make you chuckle sometimes hence making even the boring parts somewhat enjoyable.   <br />I recommend it for beginners in Java with not much background in programming in general.  Combined with the online documentation on java.sun.com, it is a great tool for making cool things with Java.	2001-01-26

I am only a college student whose cooking skills are almost nonexistent, yet this particular book made me the chef of the day.  The first thing I cooked out of this book was the cheese stuffed eggplant - at first I was terrified how it was going to come out, but the recipe was delicious, meat free (meat's expensive, so meat free is a great plus for a poor college kid), and with pictures to compare whether what I have made is actually what was supposed to be made.  My roommates liked it very much, nobody complained, and I didn't blow up the kitchen or anything :). <br />I highly recommend it to anyone whose major concern is the ability to cook cheaply and effectively.  Most of the recipes include things which can be stored for a couple of days prior to final preparation.  It also includes a basic overview of dietary needs of a meat eater and vegetarians, explaining the alternatives for both.  But the best thing about it, that since it is so beautiful and classy looking, it gives you confidence to cook and doesn't make you feel like a total moron in the kitchen.	2001-01-26

The characters are beatifully developed in a setting full of &quot;Satanists&quot;, freaks, child molesters, self-esteem problems, and of course, cool hats. <br />The art of this novel exhibits the great style of Daniel Clowes, this time in pale blue/green (as it was originally published in the Eightball series), maybe intentionally alluding to the title. <br />It is an excellent graphic novel, one of the best in the genre.  Not for those with weak stomachs, but rather for greatly openminded individuals bored with their lives and the stupidity of reality. <br />I recommend it (in my pretentious way) to every intelligent person out there.	2001-01-26

A great absurdist comedy that is both a social commentary and an exercise in argumentative youth philosophy of early 20th century Poland.  Slow at first, it describes the battle of oneself with the outside world as much as the inside desires and shortcomings. <br />Pay attention to the class assignments and activities the students participate in during school.

It is a beautiful and great book because it makes you laugh - in its own great non funny way.  It is not laughing out loud, of course, more like chuckling to yourself as you read it.  You even get to identify with the characters of the book, with their weird perks and idiosyncracies.  In our real world, the cronopios have a great cult following (at least online) - in the book, they are what people strive to be: worry-free animals in pursuit of happiness.   <br />I read this book on a regular basis, mostly in short pieces.  It is written in short chapters, so even when you are too tired to read anything else, this will cheer you up. <br />Recommended for all conoisseurs of inventive and experimental literature.	2001-01-26

From the basics of ethics through the considerations of existence to the importance of the soul - this book provides simple anecdotes implementing  the major questions in philosophy.  It allows the reader to ponder upon the  answers but in addition, it provides a semi-answer guide in the back, which  even though it doesn't explain everything to the reader's satisfaction, it  points to the areas in philosophy where such questions may be answered to a  greater extent.  A nice guide through philosophy organizing in a way the  paths an amateur philosopher will have to travel to satisfy his curiousity  about the world from the philosophical point of view.  <br />I recommend it  for beginners in philosophy as well as hardcore philosophers with low  self-esteem.  101 Philosophy Problems doesn't treat you like an idiot but  at the same time it provides the basis for more answers.	2000-08-03

The movie (Director's cut, of course) lacks  nothing - it is beautifully rendered by Ridley Scott with great imagery of  a dystopian futuristic (according to the 80's) world. <br />My recommendation  is that you read the novel and see the movie - it is the only way to fully  enjoy the wonder of artificial intelligence embedded in an almost human  body.

This is a great book to read if you like short stories - just read the part  about Lessa until she comes to the Weyr.  This is the story, if I'm not  mistaken, for which Anne McCaffrey won a prize.  After that part, you can  skip it and you will not miss that much. <br />Otherwise, this novel is a  great example of fantasy novels - interesting enough plot, one or two  characters are nicely developed, good and bad things happen, and the ending  is more happy than not. <br />I recommend it for sci-fi/fantasy readers.	2000-08-01

Michael Whelan's style is gorgeously captured in this state-of-the art book.  If you are a fan of Michael Whelan's airbrush art or his private collection, you will find something in this book for you.  It includes most  of the passages paintings, the more famous covers (even the loathsome  fuzzies), and many of Michael Whelan's unpublished work.  The latter is  what makes the book worth buy - I wish the book contained more of it and  less of the cover art.  I recommend this book for any fantasy art  collector.	2000-08-01

It seems that the creators of this beautifully embellished book did not consider a good storyline a necessary part of written medium.  Rick Berry deserves five starts for his splendid computer art.  Harlan Ellison  deserves one star for his abomination of a story, which tried to take on  the hysteria of a dystopia but miserably failed.  Overall, I recommend this  book for fantasy art collectors.  If you're here to get this book for the  story, don't bother - you're better off donating your money to a lost  cause.	2000-08-01

No more looking for old paperbacks of this great saga - in this compelation, all of the Chronicles are included, although I would not recommend reading them all at once.  As a matter of fact, skip the last 4  parts.  Other than that, this is Zelazny at his best offering the curious  everyday wonders of the sci-fi world beyond.  I recommend it for hardcore  sci-fi/fantasy readers as a great introduction to Zelazny.	2000-08-01

This wonderful Tale of True Love and High Adventure contains all that is needed to make a fairy tale exciting, dangerous, and fun to read.  When compared to the movie, it stands high and adds the little perks only a book  can add - the greater explanation of the love between the main characters,  the background of the cool sidekicks, and the wonderful journalist  commentary on the level of Buttercup's beauty.  I highly recommend if  whether you have seen the movie or not.	2000-08-01

It contains great word play, clever ideas, and the ability to make you wonder about the limitless value of the  world. <br />Greatly written prose in both languages - the translator into  English deserves much credit.  When you read it, you will taste every word  and find it synonymous with fresh rasberries with whipped cream and chunks  of pistachio nuts (or whatever floats your boat). <br />The Cyberiad is a  mixture of humor parallel to one exhibited in the creations of Julio  Cortazar and Douglas Adams.  To ponder the existence of things as well as  the presence of the most common objects is Lem's domain.  Although I do not  usually like to provide quotations for take out of context, they do not  mean much, this one provides a great example of Lem's clever style:  <br />&quot;Everyone knows that dragons don't exist. But while this simplistic  formulation may satisfy the layman, it does not suffice for the scientific  mind. The School of Higher Neantical Nillity is in fact wholly unconcerned  with what does exist. Indeed, the banality of existence has been so amply  demonstrated, there is no need for us to discuss it any further here. The  brilliant Cerebron, attacking the problem analytically, discovered three  distinct kinds of dragon: the mythical, the chimerical, and the purely  hypothetical. They were all, one might say, nonexistent, but each  nonexisted in an entirely different way ... &quot; <br />In addition, if you  as a reader know anything about the social attitudes of the late 70's in  Poland, you will find this book to be a weird and exciting commentary on  the Polish people of that particular period. <br />The Cyberiad is worth a  read for many reasons, and it must be re-read on a regular basis.  I highly  recommend this collection of short stories for long reads, short reads,  one-pagers, reading backwards, making codes by skipping every other word,  and reading with your eyes closed.  Once you have this book in your hands,  you cannot go wrong from there.	2000-07-29

It tackles a great plot by developing it smoothly and embracing it with the true dorkiness of a computer scientist.  Stephenson thinks that hackers are cool, which we can overlook in favor of other great things about the novel.  A great read if  you have lots of time on your hands. <br />Whether you like computers or not,  you will like this book.  I learned most of my Unix commands from it.   Also, Stephenson explains in detail the optimal eating pattern for cereal.  <br />Enjoyable, challenging, and imaginative.  If you haven't read it yet, do  it now and write an online review for it - .........	2000-07-29

All events tie in together to form a delicious whole as the characters discover one page at a time the mysterious past and uncertain future of their lives.  Treasure, lizards, and evil people to be conquered - this is  what this novel is about.  Also in a subtle way, Holes points out the evils  of ignorance and racism.  Great moral story, recommended for kids as well  as adults.	2000-07-29

Imaginative monsters, great ways to tackle  them, and pure magic - the kind you always wanted to read about. <br />The  characters are highly developed, the little tiny love theme is not  obnoxious, and the world of magic described is wonderful and charming as  well as scary and interesting. <br />I wish this book were available in  English and/or not out of print. <br />I highly recommend it as one of the  basics for your fantasy collection.	2000-07-29

Is it a good book?  No.  It's prolonged and boring.  After a hundred pages reading the same thing over and over again becomes a torture,  the characters are underdeveloped, and the plot is almost non-existent.    <br />This book would've made a wonderful short story.  It's written in good  style, but if you skip a page, or two, or ten at a time, you're not missing  much. <br />I recommend it only for its novelty value.	2000-07-28

The Harry Potter books are turning out to be a sort of a milestone in children's books.  They're &quot;wonderful&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, and &quot;beautiful&quot;.  I agree with this sort of description, however, it  is important to point that this series of books is an epitome and therefore  a generic example of any novel about magic.<br />How is it generic if it  seems so original?<br />J.K. Rowling is a master at combining what every good  book needs: the old war between the good and evil, lots of magic tricks,  and a likeable main character (for we cannot not like Harry because he's an  orphan, right?).<br />The books contain all the ingredients any book about a  school of magic should have: magical creatures, wise and evil wizards,  strange spells, and weird professors.  On the other hand, it is not  difficult to find these in other books for children.  Yet the fame of Harry  Potter lives on - is it because we have forgotten to venture into the land  of books and we only pick what is most popular?  Nobody seems to remember  Roal Dahl or J.R.R. Tolkien - the Harry Potter books are much easier to  obtain (especially with all the discounts on them).<br />Ok.  I don't want to  seem that I am against the Harry Potter books - they are pretty and  well-written.  It is nice to see little six-year-olds carrying the giant  seven hundred page long books with them.<br />But Harry Potter books is not  all there is - try something else for a change, people, away with the cult  of Harry Potter :)<br />As for the book number four.<br />The Goblet of Fire is  well written although it seems a bit rushed.  It is almost as if J.K.  Rowling meant to write it as a longer book and had to stop herself to make  it fit something.<br />Also, it is much easier to expect who the guilty party  is going to be.  The previous books would have three kinds of suspects:  a.  the obviously guilty ones, b. the obviously innocent, and c. characters who  were not suspects at all.<br /><br />In the previous books, it was the characters  who were beyond suspicion who turned out to be guilty.  Book #4 seems to be  a slip, for it does not hold us on the same lever of excitement, for we  easily predict who is trying to kill Harry Potter this time (simply by  choosing b, not c).<br />Overall, I give the book 4 stars, not 5.  This book  does not stand as high as the previous ones, yet, I still highly recommend  it.previous books, it was the characters  who were beyond suspicion who turned out to be guilty.
