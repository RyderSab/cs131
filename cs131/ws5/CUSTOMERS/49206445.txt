Bellow plays Bozwell to the T as he paints a vivid picture of the colorful professor with his love of Cuban cigars, Hermes ties , shirts from Jermyn street &amp; Plato .As long as Bellow sticks to his purported theme he makes for quite an enjoyable read as he recounts  the quirks,eccentricities,wit and brilliance of Alan Bloom .However the second half of this novel is no more than morbid navel-gazing on the part of Bellow as he broods over his own mortality and brush with death . I don't particularly like Bellow's prose ,though he does compensate for the stylistic deficiency with his somewhat unique wit and idiosyncratic  observation .	2001-02-05

To put things in perspective , had you invested 1 dollar with LTCM in '94 it would have grown to 4 by the spring of '98 .Those 4 dollars would have shrunk to 25 CENTS in a little less than three months later after the dust had settled !The underlying principle behind LTCM being to take advantage on the &quot;discrepencies&quot; between bond and equity spreads (looking for &quot;inefficiencies&quot; ) with the assumption that markets tend to overshoot in the short term but revert to the baseline in the longer term . A bevy of ex-Salomen arbitrageurs (headed by John Meriwether) and  a couple of Nobel laureates were supposed to gain LTCM an edge over the market . To amplify  their results (since fluctuation in bond spreads are relatively small) they used leverage to their gills ____with assets of 4 billion dollars they were leveraged to the tune of 120 billion !Their plans worked brilliantly till '98 when the Russian default  set off a domino effect that shook the entire international financial system : the spreads on LTCM trades instead of narrowing actually WIDENED (flight to safety) .This coupled with LTCM's fatal reliance on leverage saw to it that the fund was decimated as its Wall Street competitors (especially Goldman Sachs) smelling blood  actually shorted the trades  LTCM was long !!! The rest as they say is history .The Fed realising that LTCM's implosion could virtually dynamite Wall Street stepped in and engineered a buyout of its assets by 6 major firms .This is a page-turner and Lowenstein should be commended for it.	2001-02-01

He covers index investing with John Bogle ,modern portfolio theory with Markovitz, forecasting market trends with Marty Zweig and value investing with Mario Gabelli , to name a few . Seeing all these different approaches drives home the point that investing is an art as well as a science (however imperfect and empiric)___there being the proverbial 1001 ways of skinning a cat ! I noticed that some of the earlier reviewers were a bit dismissive of the experts culled in this book .Well that was prior to the Nasdaq slaughter in the yr 2000 (Nazz down 39% !) I hope that the last year has taught folks who had seen the markets go only skyward that investing is a complex (and fascinating) art and more than just buying and selling the latest fad !

Given the fact that the general public knows so little about this man  whose policies can make all the difference whether they wear new shoes for X-mas or eat the older ones (!) , this glimpse into the life of Alan Greenspan is both timely and fascinating.This is a short book (230 pages) but covers most of the bases of Greenspan's life____from his youth in New York's Washington Heights with his single mother (his parents divorced when Alan was 5)  to his brief foray into the world of jazz (as an amateur clarinettist) and subsequent economic training at the NYU___ followed by a couple of decades in private practice as an economic advisor to different corporations and clients . His involvement with Ayn Rand's Objectivist group is  covered .Politically he came to prominence as the head of the council of economic advisors(CEA)to president Ford in the mid-70's during which he tried to grapple runaway  &quot;stagflation&quot; (unsuccesfully , but its arguable if anyone else could have ) after which he advised Mr.Reagan on economic issues . He reached the pinnacle of his career when Reagan made him the Fed chairman in 1987 in which capacity he has steered the US monetary policy since then .Greenspan's handling of the '87 crash , the '91 recession and the '98 Asian contagian is explained in a clear and lucid language. Along the way Martin sprinkles the account with personal and professional anecdotes &amp; observations from Greenspan's associates like Bill Seidman &amp; Henry Kissinger etc.Contrary to his deceptively benign public persona Greenspan is a consummate politician who has mastered the ropes of Power as practiced in Washington .Finally , Martin in this book has given one of the finest explanation of the late 80's S&amp;L crisis that I have come across . A good read !	2000-12-18

Vidal garnishes his  observations of the city and its people with  characteristic irreverant humor.The pace of the book is pretty informal with short chapters devoted to the origins of Venice, its geography , the great mercantile Venetian empire which lasted over a millenium ,the flowering of arts : Veronese , Tintoretto, Giorgione , Vivaldi &amp; Palladio were all at some point or another associated with the city . Also interspersed are some observations about Venice which most foreigners may not be familiar with e.g: &quot;There is no sight more beautiful than Venice under a snowfall .Venice is like a once-great beauty who deserves to be seen by candlelight , and the soft light of winter works like a photographer's air-brush on the city's many cracks and wrinkles .Venice is particularly beautiful in a winter mist &quot; etc.Also included is a chapter on the high and mighty who chose to spend some time in Venice : Henry James, Byron, Richard Wagner not to mention that Stravinsky is buried there .This is a good light read and Vidal is an entertaining guide along the way.	2000-12-11

The events leading up to the dismissal of  the &quot;Rump&quot; parliament in 1652 and the establishment of the  protectorate (essentially Cromwell's dictatorship) are also narrated  ably.All the important battles(Edgehill,Naseby etc) are sketched in detail  .Antonia Fraser does a pretty good job collating and narrating all the  major events in Cromwell's life but what's missing from this book is LIFE  (incidentally the &quot;bio&quot; in biography stands for  &quot;life&quot;!) .It is an OK history but a fairly mediocre biography  .For instance Cromwell is widely regarded as the man who galvanised the  energies of 17th century England (by getting rid of an effete monarch and  massively building up the navy)  effectively laying down the foundations of  the subsequent British empire but this book gives the reader very little  sense of that .Considering that Cromwell's contemporaries included figures  like Cardinal Mazarin,Milton,William Harvey,Francis Bacon and the birth of  Newton(1642 AD) this book does a fairly poor job of giving us a  &quot;feel&quot; for the post Elizabethan England and the dynamic energy  that must have characterised it ____a good biography being more than just a  day to day narrative of the subject's life.This is quite a leaden and  turgid book .I finished it more out of a sense of obligation than pure  reading pleasure( it is more than 700 pages long!) .

Though Vendler's  critical interpretations are at times  a bit leaden &amp; overly  &quot;technical&quot; , her  sensitivity for these sonnets comes across in  spades , throughout the book .I especially enjoyed her vocal renderings of  65 of these sonnets on the accompanying CD which are sensitive,nuanced and  a  sheer auditory  joy ! (esp 12,29,30 &amp; 55)_____much better than Sir  John Gielgud's version , which I always considered a trifle affected  .Vendler also convinced me that the best way to enjoy these sonnets is by  etching them in your memory ! A lot of their nuance and the sheer majesty  of their language is lost on you if approached cursorily .	2000-07-16

Obviously  you cannot take everything that Graham tells you too literally , following  the gist of his advice will save you a lot of grief and handwringing.In  medicine , one of the cardinal dictums is &quot;primum non nocere&quot;  i.e. first do no harm .The abiding pinciple behind Graham's argument is:  FIRST LOSE NO MONEY ....	2000-07-14

In a land known for its drab, faceless politicians who are just about as intriguing as a door knob ,ZAB was a whiff of fresh  air_____and the crowds took to him in droves .Stanley Wolpert paints a  remarkably life-like portrait of this gifted but tragically flawed former  prime minister of Pakistan.To this day ZAB's mention stokes heated  arguments across most segments of the political spectrum in his  country____a man Pakistanis loved , as well as loved to hate .A strange  admixture of Machiavelli , chairman Mao and Mussolini ___all rolled into  one! A larger than life figure (by Pakistan's much diminished standards) he  could be__ by turns__ charming , arrogant , vindictive  ,compassionate,fascist and a democrat....a strange product of enlightened  western education and dark atavistic-feudal forces.Wolpert traces Bhutto's  life through his privileged childhood in pre-partition India onto his  student years at UC Berkeeley and Oxford.His meteoric rise through Pakistan  politics is ably narrated right upto the final denoument____his execution  on cooked-up murder charges by the military junta that deposed him.This  book is very well researched and draws upon extensive first hand interviews  with Bhutto's friends &amp; associates.It is peppered with interesting  nuggets of information which would interest any student of Pakistan  history.It is fairly &quot;well-padded&quot;Z.A Bhutto was a deeply  divisive and polarising figure whose tragic end added a certain mystique to  his legacy.This balanced ,objective but sympathetic account is a must read  for  Bhutto bashers as well as those who take a more kindly view of this  complex figure.	2000-07-13
