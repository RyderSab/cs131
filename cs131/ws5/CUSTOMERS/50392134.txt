Love and food are two of my favorite subjects, so how could I resist this book?  I was not disappointed.  The loss element keeps the story subtantive so that its not just another piece of fluff.  The book has hilarious characters (including an overbearing narcissist in an amoeba jumper), but the author treats all with compassion enough to make them full and true.  The food styling scenes bring together Hollywood fakery with a delicious disgustingness (photographing motor oil poured on macshed potatoes to resemble a sundae).  You can't help cheering on narrator Julia as she navigates the  crazies and searches out her soul in a soul-less city.  Buy this book right away and enjoy!	2005-05-29

It is wonderful to be able to try so many recipes without then having 100 cookies.  It is a perfect book for making a cookie platter--you can make many kinds and fit them on one big plate!  The best things about the book are that there are a wide variety of recipes and that all of them are fabulous.  Her chocolate chip cookie recipe is the best in the world.	2005-03-11

On the other hand, I thought about a third of the book could have been cut.  If you are interested in white people's involvement in the civil rights movement or current racial issues in the deep South or marriage and parenting issues, there's something in this book for you.

Not so with this book, which reads with the smooth flow one might expect in a well-written feature story.  One of the most interesting points of the book is a repudiation of the current popular idea that divorce itself is destroying children, pointing out that divorce is not an isolated event.  Instead, the book examines the process of divorce: even if the parents don't make a legal split, much of the damage to kids is in the high conflict between parents.  If the parents do divorce, it's what occurs before and after that affects families more that the moment of the marriage's legal dissolution.  The book also addresses class issues, presenting a divorce case typical of many families in America--a family concerned with getting by on a blue/pink collar income, not with reading sociology books.  The authors also address the role fathers play in intact families and trace the extension of that role to the divorced dad, profiling a composite man who relates to his children through his wife when they remain married and who has trouble building a separate father-identity once the mother is no longer his intermediary.  The book points out that this role is changing--albeit slowly--especially in segments of the middle class, but divorce policy issues must address what is typical rather than what is ideal, and for now the burdens of divorce fall disproportionately on mothers.  The final chapter on policy gives much fodder for more study.  Overall, this is a thought-provoking and readable exploration of what will certainly remain a major, if unfortunate, component of American family life.	2004-05-09

The Mexican wedding cookies are hands down the best I've ever had.  I make the chocolate chocolate chip cookies all the time.  Using the book requires a little patience because each recipe make hundreds of treeny tiny cookies, although Brooks does give techniques to make it go faster.  Complaints about the book: the chocolate chip cookie recipe is oily and gross.  Either the proportions are wrong, or pine nuts cannot be substituted for pinon nuts.  Many recipes are for pan cookies that you simply cut into teeny tiny squares.  Seems like that could be done with any bar cookie.  But there are enough winners in the book to make it worthwhile, plus people just love the little cookies.  I put them in Chinese food take out boxes lined with tissue to make a great gift.	2003-12-23

Most projects look tacky and amateurish.  Even in the well constucted photos, if you look closely at the objects, they look clumsy and even tacky.  If you want to learn to use wire, get Wonderful Wire Works.  Many of those projects can have beads added or already have beads on them.

But buy this book on how to do it anyway.  The photo art alone is worthwhile for the inspiration.  The book also has a number of templates for cute ideas that one might not think of, like a book that looks like a little purse, and unusual ideas, like using a door hinge as a cover.  In addition, as always, the book is a kit in itself and has perfect instructions and materials (minus scissors and a stapler)for getting kids started.  The papers included are varied and attractive.  As an adult, I am having fun with this book and have used it as a springboard for my own creative additions.	2002-10-31

There are many projects and numerous techniques, not just the flat scroll work, but also free standing miniatures and some leaf cutting, etc.  However, I find most of the projects to look very old-fashioned in a way that is tacky rather than charming--wall hangings of chickadees and the like.  This book is particularly good for making more complicated Christmas designs or variations for many basic flowers.  If you are learning to quill, this book is a good place to start, but if you are already familiar with quilling, you might want to go for a book with more contemporary ideas and patterns.	2001-01-29

The cards in this book are bright and pretty.  The author has creative ideas for many specific holidays and events.  The cards are very pattern oriented rather than technique oriented.  The author has published a lot of work on scrapbooking, and there is a fair amount of emphasis on having particular colors of cardstock and on using the patterns in the back of the book.  She does give many ideas for types of cards (pop-up, accordion, ribbon tied, etc.)  I like the book, but to get a card that looks just like hers seems like it would often take a fairly long time investment unless you had some pretty specialized tools.  It does offer some great inspirations and the photography is very nice.	2000-12-22

She did, however, like wearing the ones that I made.  This is definitely more of a kit than a book.  It comes with a small pamphlet with some cool design ideas, but that's the only paper involved.  If you bought this kid to do with a larger group (scouts or a party activity), you'll need a lot more than the three gel pens provided.

Finally at a bookstore, I picked up a copy, and after leafing through decided it was something I had to try.  My first attempts, a coral snake and a turtle, came out just like the pictures.  Just a few weeks later, I painted two turtles to look like a friend's pets and gave them to her for her birthday.  Her uncle liked them so much that he wants to comission me to paint a rock for him.  It's amazing what fantastic results you get because of the clear, step-by-step instructions.  Even I was impressed by my first rabbit and kitten.  I am not much of an artist (although I enjoy crafts), but I have learned a lot of art techniques from this book, and I think I will soon feel comfortable adapting some of the designs.  The gallery of photos at the end of the book was fun to look at.  This is a craft that is fun, relaxing, and quite charming--I'm so glad I took a second look and gave it a chance.	2000-12-08

As always, Lin's instructions are crystal clear, taking you through every step.  I like crafts but have never been good at anything representational (something that's actually supposed to look like something).  However, with this book, my rocks came out looking just like Lin's--how satisfying.  I am amazed at her generosity in sharing her techniques.  I was also happy to see her give detailed instructions for some of the animals from the gallery in her first book, such as a panda.  I'm looking forward to trying mice, and I'm hoping to gain the confidence to do a tiger.  Lin's introduction in which she shows you one of her earlier rocks is really an inspiration--even the 'real' artist has improved.  If you want to try a fun, relaxing, rewarding, inexpensive craft that wows everyone, follow Lin's step by step model and you'll even wow yourself.	2000-12-08

It seemed like I could figure it out myself, and I have a lot of craft books already.  There is something so wonderful, however, about having crystal clear instructions and all the right supplies right in front of you.  With this book, there's nothing to &quot;figure out&quot; (unless you want to vary the patterns).  You can just relax and make some adorable jewelry.  These are quick to make and look quite nice.  This is another Klutz book that I'll take to the craft class I run with teens.  My complaints about the book: the bead wheel doesn't work well--beads get stuck and shoved into other compartments or fall out the sides.  The bead colors are mixed together in color families, which is a real pain when you're trying to get all one color.  There is variety in colors, but not in beads.  A flower bead or two (like the one in one of the book's pictures) would have been nice.  Still, the patterns are pretty, quick, and do-able.  The variety of representative designs (butterfly, flower) and pretty patterns (chain)is good.  It's a fine little book.	2000-12-06

I wasn't even convinced that I wanted to make tissue paper flowers until I saw this book.  The cover says that the flowers are &quot;good enough to fool bees.&quot;  This is only a slight exaggeration.  My daffodils and carnations were remarkably realistic and very easy.  My six-year-old was able to make pom pom flowers and carnations.  After showing her the basics, I came back to the table to find she had made a vase full on her own.  The book provides templates, paper, pipe cleaners (for stems), and beautiful pictures that show myriad variations of each bloom.  In addition, the book encourages creativity and invented flowers and gives some ideas for these as well.  As an adult, I loved using this book and plan to bring it in to the craft class I run with teens.  It's a winner!	2000-10-19

No one technique is explained in much depth, and sometimes the exact materials or technique is not clear enough to be executed well on the first try.  I was not able to use acrylic paint on wallpaper size to marble (I think I need to mordant the paper).  Watercolors didn't work for suminagashi.  The &quot;absentee artist&quot; technique took a lot of tries to get the right amount of paint and the right paint consistency.  Despite these problems, I have had good luck after trial and error, and the book's myriad suggestions gave me the inspiration to experiment.  I also was introduced to many techniques that I want to pursue further by looking at books on those techniques alone.  This book provides a great introduction to the possibilities of paper as well wonderful photos.  And my numerous &quot;mistakes&quot; have made great fodder for collage.	2000-10-10

I have so many cookbooks that I was reluctant to add yet another to my  collection.  However, as a vegetarian who has added some fish and chicken  to my diet (for a number of complicated reasons), I wanted some recipes  that had these foods without just being a slab o' meat on a plate.  I like  this cookbook because it has many recipes that incorporate some meat, as  well as interesting and tasty looking vegetarian dishes.  Since my children  are still vegetarian, it's great to be able to prepare a single meal with  and without meat.  The recipes are easy and straightforward, and the author  offers helpful advice about substitutions.  I made the lo mein (half with  tofu, half with shrimp).  Everyone in my family loved it.  It was easy to  prepare, and making the two versions was a snap.  I was impressed by the  number of yummy looking vegan recipes.  I also liked the way the author  divided the recipes into ethnic categories (American, Eastern European,  Asian, etc).  While some recipes are not gourmet fare (hot dog goulash or  fried rice based on a Rice-a-Roni mix), most look simple and homey and some  are definitely company fare.  I thank Carol Gelles for simplifying making  veggie and non-veggie meals at the same time.  And I thank her for making  them taste good.	2000-08-21

However, they  are sold at stained glass supply houses as &quot;jewels.&quot;  They are  also sold in millimeters, not inches (which is how the size is given in the  instructions).

While some of their books are clearly for children (based on the types of crafts  produced and the simplicity of the projects), Beadlings offers kid and  adult appeal.  I am over 30 and had a great time making these with a  nine-year-old friend (he made the baby tree frog).  As usual, Klutz's  instructions are crystal clear.  Beadlings is more creative than many  similar beading books because it uses bugle and wonder beads in addition to  seed beads.  The book also offers some great suggestions about what to DO  with all the cute little critters you make.  A suggestion that they don't  make is to use the beadlings as earrings--just attach to a French hook  (which can be bought in bulk very cheaply).  While they give enought beads  to make the projects, anyone who wants to keep going will need a fresh  supply, and the specific beads they use are not necessarily easy to find in  craft shops.  Many internet sites offer the supplies at great prices.  I  have bought a lot of beads to get variety in the project colors.	2000-08-16
