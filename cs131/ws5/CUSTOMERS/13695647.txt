After reading this book I realized she became one at the Actor's Studio in NYC. The same studio that made Brando and her Rebel costar James Dean. After Dean died Nat studied there. She made a film for Elia Kazan (Brando and Dean's old director) and became more of a method actress. I hate the part of this book that compliments her also costar Warren Beatty on his looks.

A whole section is devoted to most of Tulia, Mississippi's 10% African-American population recently getting arrested. While the author (himself African-american)is forever boringly blabbing about the problems of his racial countrymen he actually seemingly resorts to subtle (possibly sneaky) means to describe what he considers to be another problem for his racial countrymen. He describes a school in DC where the building is falling apart and never mentions that he is probably only writing about the school in failing condition because most or all of it's students and faculty are african-american! I think this particular school he wrote about is untypical of the rest of the USA as I know the mostly hispanic town of Lawrence, MA is getting a big, beautiful new high school. I think the school Herbert wrote was just an untypical example of bad faculty or maybe bad city management on a higher level. <br /> Other ways his views of what he considers problems for (mostly) his racial countryman are that he is too one-sided. He mentions stuff like welfare cuts. Gosh Herbert did it ever occur to you that such cuts are so the people won't get on welfare and plan to stay their whole lives on it. We want to get people to become productive not lazy! <br /> <br />The worse thing about this book outside of it's disproportioned alotment to non-hispanic african-american problems--when such african-american only make up around 13% of the entire USA population according to the 2000 US Census--is his ridiculous handling of discussing the situation in US-occupied <br /> Iraq. For starters he describes a peace movement that took place in early 2003 to say to get Saddam out of Iraq without war. That was impossible. The man had tons of money from his oil sales and other ventures, many arab allies,business contacts all over the world, and was immune to the effects of assassination as he provenly employed quite a few doubles of himself to make personal appearances. How could he have been thrown out without military force? He couldn't. The author personally goes for this nutty get-Saddam-out-without war bit in two areas of his book. Other problem he has in dealing with the US lead occupation of Iraq is that he is comparing it to Vietnam. Look Hebert and look good! The US employed over 8 million army, navy, air force and marine personnel in the Vietnam War and that was with a draft! There is no draft in the US-lead Iraqi occupation. We've employed less than half a million men and women in this war so far and our death count is under 1800 the death count in the VietNam conflict was above 58,000! There is no analogy! <br /> <br />In the last area of his book he starts writing about only so many people knowing evolution. What on earth that had to do with anything else in this book I don't know!	2005-07-11

I give him the answer. The USA was still a little paralyzed from the militarily-crippling antiwar demonstrations of the late 1960's early 70's. Those demonstrators made it hard for the USA to use the american army, navy, air force and marine corps in any kind of fight. True we used the military in Desert Storm but only till the Iraqis were out of Kuwait. Taking over Iraq in 1991 was too sure to bring heavy US civilian protesting movements. By 2003 the former 60's protester were too old or had passed away or were now too involved in their own lives to take such an active part in organizing effective demonstration movements.	2005-07-11

Like about how Bush's military campaign in Iraq was a success but here is a few points the author Goldberg clearly is faulty on: <br /> <br />1)That when it came to civil rights for African-americans in the 1960's there was no other side to the story. That the african-american should have nothing but success in their attempt at civil rights. Huh? Every big story has two sides. Here's the flip-side of the african-american debate. That african-americans are only 10% of the american population of the 1960's with caucasian-americans the other 89%! There were too many places in this country that just had no african-americans involved due to their sheer lack of numbers. Another sides of the story were that caucasian-americans could get too ostracised from society in the 1960's for letting the african-americans in. And so many americans (of any race!) were too busy with their own hard-life problems to bother with Martin Luther King and his civil rights attempts anyway! <br /> <br />2)The author presents his opinions on celebrities and their worth like it is a fact! It's only his opinion (good or bad). <br /> <br />3)The way Greenberg criticises the entire Carter administration on the ground of things like unemployment. Well, Carter deserves a lot of credit for keeping the USA out of just about any fighting during his 1977-81 administration. He was good for this country in nearly every way but one. He let the Shah lose Iran and let America get the humiliating Iran-hostage crisis in 1979 all due to his lack of will to in anyway fight thus showing America has to use some military force in the future to keep clear of such humiliating and deadly problems like that.	2005-07-06

I dipute that. I think ancient Greeks were just living in a very temperature-wise hot, sunny climate and as a result were often semi-nude or even nude with people of the same sex. The affection the same sex showed each other was traditional and very most likely didn't usually include the act of doing it. Also, on other homosexual points it's somewhat wrong of Cantor to point out gay English kings. Even though a defense of this could be that Cantor was only pointing a fact in this instance I have studied medieval history for years and never before heard of this terrible fact of these particular English monarchs engaging in the Bibilically sinful act of homosexuality. A personal point on something different I also got of bored of hearing how English and Spanish people ate. Hey neither of these groups are noted for their great food (tacos are mexican food). Talk more about what italians ate in the middle ages please! Cantor has done better writing. I prefer his book on the plague to this one by far!	2005-07-01

Save for two facts (that DNA studies have positively proven MAN is a genealogical cousin to apes and all other mammals, birds, fish, insects and plants and protists on this planet plus those same studies prove that man is many multiple times older than the book of Genesis made the human race look)science has proven very little about human origins. We know nothing about how old most mammal fossils that have no, say, egyptian grave date to confirm their carbon dating date, really are. A neanderthal fossil, for just one example, could be 10,000 years old or 50,000 years old or even half-way to a million years old! No way to tell! Also the extinction of dinosaurs could be 65 million years ago or just 650,000 years ago. This Future Evolution book prints things like the extinction of dinosaurs date as 65 million years like this is a fact that that is when the dinos went extinct (save for birds).

Ok. A free attorney, just because he or she isn't the personal attorney to the governor of the state the crime occurred in, is usually no solution to the arrested African-American kid's problem. So therefore according to Cosby (and the agreeing Dyson) the only solution is---what? Neither gives a solution. But it seems to me that according to either man the solution is either of the following : <br /> <br />1)Legalize armed robbery for african-american youths <br /> <br />2)Get multi-million dollar lawyers for african-american youths charged with armed robbery and who don't have money. Ensure all poor african-american youths contemplating armed store robbery of complete immunity should they get caught. <br /> <br />Both men are shortsighted losers for feeling the way they do on this subject. I also debate that Dyson appears to say that Martin Luther King Jr. could provenly cheat on his marriage and no one should pick on his memory for it. And for those who elevate Cosby to almost saint-status for getting  many African-Americans into college I say this:African-American track star Jesse Owens was in college before Bill Cosby was even born. West Point accepted african-americans as cadets more than 2 entire decades also before Bill Cosby was even born. Cosby is nowhere near the Messiah-like character so many of his fans make him out to be. And lastly I Spy and The Cosby Show are mere works of tv show fiction. Whatever they show african-americans like they are just make-believe. Remember that good and hard! <br /> <br />	2005-06-20

Why shouldn't the early literate, civilized american colonists have considered themselves superior to Indians who had no writing and were just about completely living in the stone age (though the early white americans may have considered the indians to be more like European barbarians rather than stone age types as little was known of caveman times in the ad 1600's). Realize covering all the important american history is quite a task and therefore his main aim is to show that some people too many americans thought were good (like Mafia-puppet John F. Kennedy)were really not so hot to trot. Excellent point about Kennedy as a fraud writer. What he didn't emphasize enough was that Franklin Roosevelt refused to let Jews into America when the Nazis tried to send the live Jews here. This somewhat caused Hitler to finally order the grisly Final Solution on the Jews in the early 40's. Hitler had a deserevedly very bad rep by 1939 and I cannot much understand why Roosevelt simply didn't settle many  refugee Jews in say Arizonia. Britain's Winston Churchill was way more than a little guilty of refusing many refugee Jews into England or Palestine and (as that isn't quite American history) this fact (as a footnote) along with the total condemnation of FDR for refusing refugee Jews should be included in an updated edition of this book.	2005-06-20

Harrison is wrong to a degree when he talks about man being a pathological killer in the gun section of the book. The Gatling gun was invented by a man who was trying to end warfare (he was hoping the gun would be so scarily lethal that no one would want to go to war) yet no mention of Gatling's noble motive was made by Harrison. Also, how many people only carried, or even invented new forms of, guns to defend themselves against bears or wolves or hyenas etc. You know back in the 1800's many people (even those who lived in towns) had to put with occasional bear attacks and unwelcomed ursine visits and there were no tranquilizer guns in those days (unlike today) so to get a bear rendered harmless you had usually to shoot with bullets.

For that to be true these roads would have to have been constructed in 3 AD. Actually the roads were built 1960 years ago or less. That was the year (43 AD) that the Romans conquered portions of what is now Great Britain. On other matter, Syrians from the Middle East settled in Europe (eventually especially the British Isles) around 10,000 years ago. They became Europe's first farmers (check Spencer Wells's brilliant Journey of Man book for more on these people). Fraser writes of the first people in the British Isles settling in the area about 5,000 yeras ago and only generically mentions they came from the Meditteranean.

The drawing of Idle as a lady in a painting (located in the back of the book) is odder than anything ever seen on Monty Python. Plus, the book is not always all that much about his tour, his relationship to ex-late Beatle George Harrison teeters on the homo-sexual side, badly edited (as already pointed out). The poster who suggested we blame Idle and not the publishing company was right on the money. But also the book's extra-weird slant is truly Idle's fault as well. The publishing company was not to stop him thus risking losing money and instead letting him get away with all this extra-repulsively weird stuff. jhe could've took his book biz elsewhere. Idle when are you gonna realize you're just making a retard of yourself acting weird in real life like this.	2005-05-02

This book wrongly makes it sound as if Saddam completely behaved himself in 1991 on after the Gulf War ended early that year. Also, the book never mentions how George W. Bush gave Iraq the chance to surrender in 2003 before finally invading.	2005-04-30
