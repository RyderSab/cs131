This may be from her being on antipsychotics or it may have been something else, but towards the end of the book, the book got less interesting than it had been at the beginning.  If you have psychosis, you might want to check this out, though it might be a bit triggering for self-injurers as there are some descriptions of how she cut herself.	2005-03-16

Reiland does a great job of verbally expressing the pain and anger that this disorder caused her, as well as helping to explain why she developed the disorder (her childhood experiences).  Some may be shocked by the intensity of her anger and outbursts, but one must keep in mind that these outbursts are just a sign of her problems with BPD.  She was lucky that she had an understanding husband and a very patient psychiatrist.  A lot of patients with this disorder aren't as lucky as she and end up being dumped by either their family or their therapist or both.	2005-03-15

It was tolerable. <br /> <br />The storyline could have been better developed.  Again, I understand this was based on a game, but that doesn't mean it has to only go by what happens in the game.  The author could have gotten a little more creative with it. <br /> <br />There were points where the story was confusing and complicated in the beginning, but it got too rushed towards the end.  There was a lot of time spent talking about Kakistos, who was basically a minor character, but not much time spent talking about Ethan, Cassandra, or even the First, all of whom should have had bigger parts in this book. <br /> <br />There were also some points where things just seemed to simple.  When Buffy was looking for her friends in the alternate reality, she found them too fast.  That may have been how the game unfolded, but in book form, it really made the story seem weak.	2005-03-10

Buffy is facing a new foe, in the form of a demon-god.  His vampire followers aren't like other vampires that Buffy has faced before, which causes her to be concerned.  Buffy is also warned of some impending doom by a Prophet, but she is unable to figure out what will come to pass until it is too late. <br /> <br />In this novel, Buffy doesn't quite seem like the Buffy from the tv series.  She's cold and bitter.  She's rude to her friends and is just mean compared to the tv version of her character.  Though I don't particularly enjoy her attitude, she has her reasons for being this way and I respect that. <br /> <br />The story takes a while to develop, which, though leaving you in suspense, is a bit off-putting.  It is an interesting concept, though, so for that I give the book 4 stars.	2005-03-06

I found myself having to flip back quite a bit to remind myself of who certain characters were and what the new chapters were referring to. <br /> <br />I liked the introduction of India as the Slayer who preceded Buffy.  She reminded me a bit of the season five version of Buffy in her willingness to sacrifice herself for someone she loved.  I also liked the exploration of the four elements and how they related to each Slayer. <br /> <br />One thing that I had a problem with was that Buffy and Faith seemed to be lacking their healing time.  The book referred to Faith as needing stitches for an injury that she received, which seemed odd since even when the Slayers have serious injuries (except when Faith was in a coma on the show), it rarely takes them more than a day to recover.  Being unable to recover within a day from a cut seemed unusual to me.	2005-03-06

It packs reality with humor and attitude in a way that might shame the pants off your grandmother.  This is definitely not for those girls who are afraid to embrance their inner goddess.<br />The first thing that attracted me to this book, though, was the title.  It just seemed to reflect the inner me that doesn't get to escape much.  The one who enjoys the sarcasm and acts so childish, even though I'm an adult.<br />One of the best parts is when the author decides to turn the tables on some needy guy she met on a plane.  The guy got her number and called her a few times later that week, at about four or five in the morning.  He would scream and whine into her answering machine about how much he needed her.  Well, she decided to get him back by calling him at four in the morning and yelling into his answering machine.  Honestly, it was as humorous as it was scary.<br />There are some adult innuendos in this book, but I doubt that anyone would honestly read this book to their three year olds as a bedtime story.  So, just be warned that Ms. Gilman is not afraid to push any envelopes.<br />So, this is definitely the perfect book for the tiara-wearing smartmouth goddesses of the world.	2003-02-21

The true slander of this book is Ms. Coulter's personal vendetta against all liberals and democrats. She is spreading lies and falsehoods to make herself look better. (Her comments have been publicly questioned and debated on several tv talk shows.)<br />Ms. Coulter is also a racist and has made public comments about how America should conquer all the nations of the world and convert the people to Christianity. Her intolerance is very alarming and disgusting. Quite frankly, women as hatefilled as Ms. Coulter scare me.<br />Though I understand Ms. Coulter has a First Amendment right to \\"Freedom of Speech\\". She is allowed to voice her opinion, no matter how dangerous it might be. That is her right, but that doesn't mean that people should read it.<br />So, please, people...avoid this woman who is spreading her hatred and filth.

Ms. Brodie was not writing this book as a true informative study of the LDS church.  She was writing this as a way to spread intolerance.  This book may be a convenient way for people to disprove Joseph Smith and the LDS church, but it is completely ignorant of the facts.<br />Honestly, would you want to trust someone who started writing a book convinced that she was going to find out that the church isn't true and that Joseph Smith was a liar?  Why would she even want to &quot;research&quot;?  She already knew what she wanted to find, so she was basically wasting her time.<br />This book is definitely one to AVOID!	2003-02-14

She tells of how it looked, felt, etc. It can get a bit graphic, but sometimes, you need the graphic stuff in order to understand the feelings.<br />I think that this book is exquisite. I think every self-injurer could identify with the feelings that Caroline went through. I think that non-'cutters' could identify with some of the feelings, too.<br />This book gives cutters a feeling of not being alone and non-cutters a way to understand what it's like to hurt so much that you have to hurt yourself.<br />There aren't enough words to describe how awesome this book is. I just hope that it helps you to understand how serious self-mutilation really is.	2003-02-07

She's the girlfriend of Jake and the sister of Benjamin, \\"the blind boy\\". She's the best friend to Nina, who happens to be the sister to Claire, who dates Benjamin. Claire used to date Lucas, Jake's enemy, but dumped him after an accident involving him, Claire, and Wade, Jake's brother who died in the accident. Confused yet? Heh. READ THE BOOKS!<br />Basically, this book is one where Zoey learns that she's growing up and can't depend on her lifelong habits. She's got to strike out on her own and do her own thing. Part of that means fooling around (making out) with Lucas. Then, she has to learn if she really loves Jake or Lucas.

It is very straight-forward and informative about the often misunderstood religion called Wicca.  It describes the history of Wicca and answers any newbie to the Craft's answers.  This book is different from many books on Wicca that I've seen because it actually includes a Book of Shadows (the Standing Stones Book of Shadows).  I think everyone, esp. non-Wiccans, should check this book out.  Maybe then they could decrease their hatred of those who practice the Old Religion.	2003-02-07

Then, as I saw the interviews, I noticed, she's just a normal teenage girl. She kind of reminded me of me. Then, when I read this book, I was blown away. I thought I was weird for having a close relationship with my mother. Apparently, I'm not the only one who's close to their mom. Britney and her mom are like best friends and their relationship is almost exactly like mine with my mother.<br />This book tells how Britney grew up poor, but rich. Her family may not have always had enough money or even phone service, but she still had love. The respect that her family has for one another is amazing. She had a terrific relationship with her brother, who in typical big-brother fashion, watched over her like a hawk. She has an adorable little sister who admires her. <br />Britney learned to sing when she was 3. She started dancing the year before. She always loved to perform, but was always so shy about regular conversations.<br />This book tells the story of the famous teen pop star in a rags to riches sort of way. It examines her friendships, her MMC days, and things teenage girls and moms have to talk about. It shows that with a little faith and love, you can go so far. This book also has a ton of great pictures (including some of Justin and JC of *NSYNC and Christina Aguilera).<br />I think if you want to read a touching mother-daughter book or you're a Britney fan, you should get this book. It's amazing.	2003-02-07

While it is natural to harbor some resentment to a religion that you end up leaving, this author seems to have portrayed the Church in an incorrect and somewhat defamatory state.  (It's already been defamed by so many.)  This book only furthers speculation by people who have never actually studied the Church (only books by anti-Mormons) that the Church is made up of non-Christians who have formed a cult.  That further spreads hatred and propaganda, and quite frankly, makes this world a worse place to live in.  It also subconciously spreads fear.  That fear will only be released when the fearful choose to learn about what scares them.  So, in my honest and humble opinion, as a non-LDS member who grew up in a mixed background of anti-Mormons and non-anti-Mormons, I would recommend skipping this book.	2003-02-02

It has an extreme lack of characterization and the plot is so messy.  It skips around from person to person and is written in such a way that you have no idea who is saying what and who isn't.  This had the potential to be a good book, but it was written way below its level and seems to be more of an indignity on Christianity than a helpful force.  It's more likely to make people fear God than bring them to Him.   It kind of does the opposite of what it seems to be there for.  So, I'd recommend to stay away from this book.	2002-07-09

The Scarlet Letter is a classic story of love, betrayal, lies, and an evil child all set in a Puritan town in the mid-nineteenth century.  Hester Prynne falls in love with some mysterious man and becomes pregnant with his child.  There's a slight problem.  She's married to another man who wasn't anywhere near her when she got pregnant.  In Puritan society, Hester has committed a serious crime, and when she decides not to turn over her lover to the rest of the town, they force her to wear the letter 'A' on her chest every day for the rest of her life.  With this punishment, she is also mistreated by other members of society who look at her as if she is some kind of vicious monster.<br />This is a great story to teach people about their prejudices and what happens when you fall in love with the 'wrong' person, especially after you've already married someone else.	2002-04-03

They think the &quot;insane&quot; people of the world don't cling to it also, but in the memoir of Susanna Kaysen, you see that she does.<br />All she wanted was to be a normal girl, but when normality abandoned her, she had to check herself into McLean hospital to figure out how to regain it. After spending a year and a half in the hospital, she left with no great advice to give on how to live her life or with a realization of what the meaning of life is. This doesn't mean that she learned nothing. Far from that. She learned more than almost anyone else did.<br />She learned how to survive. Not how to live, but how to survive. No one can be taught in a hospital about how to live, because the whole essence of the hospital prevents the person from living their life.<br />When the money ran out, she was kicked out of the hospital. This, sadly, is how the system works. Of course, she'd only expected to be in there for a couple of weeks. Weeks had turned into months and months into years, and by the time she was released, she thought she was a forever patient.<br />She made friends with the other members of the ward, because all of them had been doomed to longer than expected stays. They were a tight group. A group of people who cared for one another, took care of one another, but also aggrivated each other in so many ways.<br />I wanted to read this book for two reasons:<br />1.) I loved the movie it was based on. It's a bit different. Some of the scenes are the same, and if you've already seen the movie, you'll be picturing the characters doing certain things as you read about them in the book.<br />2.) Susanna was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is my diagnosis. I wanted to see how she (at the same age) handled the diagnosis. I see many similarities in the diagnosis, as well as differences. I also saw many differences/similarities in our psych hospital experiences.<br />I love this book, and I think it is very well-written. I am glad that Susanna decided to share her story with everyone. Maybe a book like this will better help more people to understand mental illness.	2002-03-14

They're cute little stories about 12 year olds who start a club to Babysit.  They meet Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in Claudia's bedroom.  You get to read about the main character of the book's big trouble in the book and you get to read about any other character who gets passed the notebook.  These are definitely great books for kids 8 and up.	2002-03-13

Somehow, I couldn't put it down.  The story of Jamie Sullivan, the awkward daughter of a widowed Baptist minister in the 1950s, and Landon Carter, the popular son of a US Congressman, is absolutely incredible.<br />They begin as absolute opposites...she's the shy, sweet girl who everyone makes fun of in school.  He's the guy everyone wants to be friends with.  They end up having the leading parts in the Christmas play, and their friendship begins to evolve.  It turns into love, but then a heartbreaking discovery may split them forever.<br />This is a walk everyone should take, but be prepared with plenty of tissues.<br />Nicholas Sparks did an excellent job describing the settings and happenings of the book.  I'd never read a book by him before, but now I'm contemplating checking out some of his other books.	2002-03-12
US	39978397	R2VWN6T7KIE8L6	1573225126	662106244	Prozac Nation	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Superb at its best	I had never read anything so thought-provoking until I read Prozac Nation by Elizabeth Wurtzel.  Elizabeth has a way of phrasing her emotions and the situations that her depression had put her into that just played in my head like a miniature movie.  It's absolutely amazing when someone can do this with a work of fiction, but even more incredible when it is a memoir.<br />Elizabeth starts the memoir with a night she and her roommate had decided to host a little party.  Unfortunately, by the time everyone got there, she was too depressed to deal with them.  She had gone off of her Lithium, which made her typical melancholy almost too much for her to handle.<br />Then, Elizabeth starts discussing how her childhood started out much like any other person her age.  Then, it just got worse and worse, much of that due to her parents and their self-absorbed personalities.  Her father was neglectful and her mother invalidated Liz's feelings and made Liz look as though she was the cause of all of the turmoil.<br />In certain ways, I could identify with Elizabeth even though her situations differed a great deal from my own...the emotions and reasonings behind them were much the same.<br />I definitely would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to teenage girls who have been suffering from depression.  It kind of helps you to understand that someone else has been through the pain you're going through.	2002-03-07

I've used this book in vocal competitions and some of the songs in it are perfect for those competitions.  Unfortunately, some are better suited for a musicals type book.  I expected when I first got this book that it would be good for more professional settings, but there are some very non-professional style songs in it.<br />Also, the songs in this book are truly meant for sopranos, so if you are a mezzo...please don't attempt this.

They think the &quot;insane&quot; people of the world don't cling to it also, but in the memoir of Susanna Kaysen, you see that she does.<br />All she wanted was to be a normal girl, but when normality abandoned her, she had to check herself into McLean hospital to figure out how to regain it.  After spending a year and a half in the hospital, she left with no great advice to give on how to live her life or with a realization of what the meaning of life is.  This doesn't mean that she learned nothing.  Far from that.  She learned more than almost anyone else did.<br />She learned how to survive.  Not how to live, but how to survive.  No one can be taught in a hospital about how to live, because the whole essence of the hospital prevents the person from living their life.<br />When the money ran out, she was kicked out of the hospital.  This, sadly, is how the system works.  Of course, she'd only expected to be in there for a couple of weeks.  Weeks had turned into months and months into years, and by the time she was released, she thought she was a forever patient.<br />She made friends with the other members of the ward, because all of them had been doomed to longer than expected stays.  They were a tight group.  A group of people who cared for one another, took care of one another, but also aggrivated each other in so many ways.<br />I wanted to read this book for two reasons:<br />1.)  I loved the movie it was based on.  It's a bit different.  Some of the scenes are the same, and if you've already seen the movie, you'll be picturing the characters doing certain things as you read about them in the book.<br />2.)  Susanna was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is my diagnosis.  I wanted to see how she (at the same age) handled the diagnosis.  I see many similarities in the diagnosis, as well as differences.  I also saw many differences/similarities in our psych hospital experiences.<br />I love this book, and I think it is very well-written.

I thought it might help me with Binge-Eating problems.  It didn't.  In fact, I got very bored.  It was sickeningly boring and only discussed how to handle things if you weren't really all that involved.<br />First of all, it's my experience with any kind of mental health problem that you can't give a person help if they don't want the help.  They have to make a conscious effort to choose to get help.  This book somewhat bypasses this whole thing.<br />Second, it states what you typically see in an Anorexic -- loss of weight, not eating, etc.  Okay, who doesn't know this?  If you didn't know this, then you probably wouldn't be picking up the book in the first place.<br />I really don't think this book would be helpful if I had a friend or family member with an eating disorder.  It's very unhelpful in my personal opinion.<br />Skip this book!	2002-02-07

(As well as other SIers.)  It explains the science behind self-injury in terms that are easily understood.  It also allows the reader to look into the lives of other SIers and understand their stories.  I think this is an incredible book and that every self-injurer should read it.

Her uncle molesting her when she was much younger.<br />With the help of her friends, Nina is able to confront her past and come out ten million times stronger.

Yes, the sisters were tried.  The only injustice, however, is that Peggy wasn't found guilty.<br />You see, the lovely thing about tv shows and books is that they can skew reality into whatever they want them to say.  They don't always show what REALLY happened.<br />You wanna know what REALLY happened with Jack, Peggy, James, and Betty?  Why don't you read through The Huntsville Times for the past 10 years?  I'll bet you didn't know that Betty Wilson had actually plotted to have Jack murdered at least once before.<br />Yes, James is a liar, but who knows?

Teen People isn't as geared towards showing teens as ditzes as other magazines can be, and I respect that.  I do like flipping through and seeing stories about my favorite artists next to stories about real issues.  I even liked the way they covered the Eminem article and I can't stand Eminem.  They provide information in a way that shows teens respect.<br />I love the Star Tracks section, too!  In case you haven't seen it before, Star Tracks is where they have a lot of candid photos of celebrities.  It basically shows the celebs as real people.<br />TP also allows their readers to participate in the magazine.  The readers can be 'Trendspotters' and try out new things.  I was once a Trendspotter and I got free nail polish that I got to try out and have my friends try out to see if they liked it.  Awesome perk.  The readers also get to have a say in the topics that are shown in the magazine.<br />I know if I was a celebrity, I would definitely want to do an article with TP first.<br />This is a really good magazine for America teens!	2002-01-25

These teens have grown up together and are, for the most part, very close.<br />In this book, Zoey, who is dating Jake, kisses Lucas.  (Lucas had been charged with drunk driving that ended up killing Jake's older brother.)  This creates a big problem for Zoey who must choose between the &quot;good guy&quot; whom she is expected to be with forever or the &quot;bad one&quot; whom she is expected to avoid at all costs.<br />She might not have to tell as long as no one else finds out, but everyone at Chatham Island are bound to know because of blabbermouth, Claire.<br />The best two characters in this book, as in all of the books, are Nina and Ben.  They add some needed comic relief.<br />I definitely think that if you like drama and romance, you'll love this.  Also, if you like funny blind guys, you'll probably enjoy this.  (You've gotta love Ben!)	2002-01-07

She tells of how it looked, felt, etc.  It can get a bit graphic, but sometimes, you need the graphic stuff in order to understand the feelings.<br />I think that this book is exquisite.  I think every self-injurer could identify with the feelings that Caroline went through.  I think that non-'cutters' could identify with some of the feelings, too.<br />This book gives cutters a feeling of not being alone and non-cutters a way to understand what it's like to hurt so much that you have to hurt yourself.<br />There aren't enough words to describe how awesome this book is.  I just hope that it helps you to understand how serious self-mutilation really is.	2002-01-06

This book tells the story of Lisa and her friends.<br />Lisa is a high school student who has gone from being your average bubbly teenage girl to being suicidal and acting very oddly for the times.  This story was placed in the sixties, when mental illness was VERY taboo.<br />Her parents want to ignore her disturbed behavior, because they think she's just being stupid.  Her friends, however, are seeing the dangers behind her self-destructive behavior.<br />I think this book is rather descriptive in its matter, which is good, because sometimes, with things like this, you have to be seeing what's going on in your mind to understand it.  Of course, I think it would be cool if they had done the story from Lisa's point of view, too.	2002-01-06

Then, as I saw the interviews, I noticed, she's just a normal teenage girl. She kind of reminded me of me. Then, when I read this book, I was blown away. I thought I was weird for having a close relationship with my mother. Apparently, I'm not the only one who's close to their mom. Britney and her mom are like best friends and their relationship is almost exactly like mine with my mother.<br />This book tells how Britney grew up poor, but rich. Her family may not have always had enough money or even phone service, but she still had love. The respect that her family has for one another is amazing. She had a terrific relationship with her brother, who in typical big-brother fashion, watched over her like a hawk. She has an adorable little sister who admires her. <br />Britney learned to sing when she was 3. She started dancing the year before. She always loved to perform, but was always so shy about regular conversations.<br />This book tells the story of the famous teen pop star in a rags to riches sort of way. It examines her friendships, her MMC days, and things teenage girls and moms have to talk about. It shows that with a little faith and love, you can go so far. This book also has a ton of great pictures (including some of Justin and JC of *NSYNC and Christina Aguilera).<br />I think if you want to read a touching mother-daughter book or you're a Britney fan, you should get this book. It's amazing.	2002-01-02
