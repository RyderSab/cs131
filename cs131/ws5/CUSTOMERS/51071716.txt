Lineage societies like the Daughters of the American Revolution, Sons of the American Revolution, United Daughters of the Confederacy, etc. got their start during this era and many books were published.  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania found itself deluged with requests for documents from its extensive holdings, so Pennsylvania began to organize its military and civil records dating all the way back to the colonial era and publish these records in series and volumes known as the Pennsylvania Archives. Due to the enormity of the project mistakes were made, but still the Pennsylvania Archives remain an excellent source for researchers and currently can be found in most large genealogical libraries.<br /><br />For those interested, Pennsylvania Archives: Series Six, Volume Ten contains a roster of the men who were in the 1st and 2nd Pennsylvania Regiments. but its Mexican War coverage is flawed for many reasons. For example, an entire company was omitted. (Co. \\"F\\" 2nd PA)<br /><br />Archivist Randy W. Hackenburg decided to revise and improve the Pennsylvania Archives portion devoted to the Mexican War, by writing this book which has a brief biography of each soldier in Pennsylvania's two volunteer infantry regiments, previously unpublished reports, summaries of  the Civil War service of many of these Mexican War veterans,  80 photographs of uniforms, flags, weapons, equipment, and Civil War vintage photos of the men, and an 89 page narrative of the activities of the two regiments from enlistment to return. Many of the companies were pre-Mexican War militia units so a one page history of each company with statistics is also included.<br /><br />Pennsylvania In The War With Mexico: The Volunteer Regiments  is essentially a reference book with narrative pages designed to provide a connection to the data. Randy Hackenburg has used period newspapers, eyewitness accounts, official records, and even the original documents used to make the Pennsylvania Archives, as a supplement to the story of troops who left Pittsburgh on steamboats, stayed in New Orleans, camped at Lobos Island, landed at Vera Cruz, fought in battles all the way  to the Halls of Montezuma, were besieged at Puebla, and helped occupy Mexico City.<br /><br />Hackenburg's work is an excellent reference tool for the researcher and is a \\"must have\\" book for anyone with a Mexican War  ancestor in one of the \\"Keystone State's\\"  two infantry regiments.ial records, and even the original documents used to make the Pennsylvania Archives, as a supplement to the story of troops who left Pittsburgh on steamboats, stayed in New Orleans, camped at Lobos Island, landed at Vera Cruz, fought in battles all the way  to the Halls of Montezuma, were besieged at Puebla, and helped occupy Mexico City.  <br /> <br />Hackenburg's work is an excellent reference tool for the researcher and is a \\"must have\\" book for anyone with a Mexican War  ancestor in one of the \\"Keystone State's\\"  two infantry regiments.	2005-04-19

Sam Camberlain was a 16 year old private from Boston who served in the elite 1st US Dragoons in Mexico and gives vivid descriptions of Saltillo, Monterrey, and Northern Mexico. Although he was not at the savage fighting during the capture of Monterrey, he claims to have been there so the reader is left to wonder about his other claims and the accuracy of his  combat in which he lied about being involved. Perhaps he had contact with those who were actually there?<br /><br />Sam Chamberlain was in the Mexican War and painted some interesting small glimpses of life & death. Reading his book is almost like listening to a veteran who seems to have been everywhere and done everything (especially with women). Sam Chamberlain relates deaths of soldiers to Mexican guerrillas and duty in the occupation but more often than not, Sam Chamberlain proclaims preposterous pick-ups with a host of women. The reader almost senses the author is bragging to fellow high schoolers in a locker room or to anyone who will listen in a bar, hence the title of the book is fitting \\"My Confessions: Recollections of a Rogue\\". This book would probably be disregarded as pure fantasy if it were not or the fact that sometimes he does detail military and daily life senarios which are proved by others.<br /><br />For those interested the Mexican War, this is a \\"must read\\" book and has been used by historians as a primary source for years because Camberlain recounts many scenes which have escaped photographers and those who made lithographs, including the massacre of Mexican civilians by Arkansas troops in a cave in Northern Mexico.<br /><br />Truth or Tall Tale or Both?

Zeh's telling is clear and adds new insight into the plight of the common soldier. A large percent of the US Army was foreign-born, so this book sheds light into a neglected aspect of the war; namely foreign-born soldiers fighting in the American ranks.<br />Frederick Zeh arrived in the USA and found hard times. He recounts the debt slavery (Purposely being paid/fed just enough to keep him from starving by his employer in New Jersey) and being fearful of the Nativist attacks against immigrants in nearby Philadelphia, which obliged him to join the US Regular Army in a special rocket/howitzer unit.<br />This is an intimate view from a common soldier. Frederick Zeh arrived at Vera Cruz and fought in the battles of Scott's campaign from Vera Cruz to Mexico City as an artilleryman. His observations of the Siege of Vera Cruz, Battle of Cerro Gordo, etc. are very precise. Do not expect much on grand strategy, as this is a tale of the dangers & hardships of a man and his comrades-in-arms.<br />Editors have corrected any minor errors by Zeh and provided excellent endnotes for clarification and further study.<br />This work could be read in a short time and pondered for much longer.	2004-05-04

Eisenhower doesn't say anything new and borrows heavily from sources available when the book was written, so some of the same mistakes are repeated. There are also some major ommissions.<br />With this understood, Eisenhower has made a readable summary of the entire war for the general public. If you are new to the subject, this would be a good book for you to start. Once this book is read, however, you should go to other places for a more indepth and accurate telling of specific facets and events.	2003-12-20

Rankin Dilworth of the 1st US Infantry. The diary reads like letters which were intended to be sent home. The entires start at Jefferson Barracks(St. Louis Missouri) on April 28, 1846 and end with Dilworth just outside of Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico on Sept 19, 1846. Lt. Rankin Dilworth was mortally wounded by a Mexican cannonball on Sept 21, 1846 during the intense assault on the city and died Sept 27, 1846.<br />There are 102 entries, with some being only a few words and others several paragraphs in length. There is one section of notes on flora &amp; fauna written by Rankin Dilworth separate from the diary. Camp life in Texas, Matamoros, Reynosa, Camargo, and the route to Monterrey are covered with ancedotes about food, women, customs, and volunteers.-Lt. Dilworth, like many regular officers was not fond of the unruly volunteers and relates his experiences so the reader can empathize.<br />Editors Joseph Chance and Lawrence Clayton borrow heavily from Francis Heitman's Historical Register and Dictionary of the United States Army and George Cullum's Biographical Register of Officers and Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy to help identify officers mentioned in the entries. Since the US Army was so small during the era before the Mexican War and the officers seem to have been quite familiar, the helpful endnotes found on pages 73 to 114 are essential to determine who is who from the names/nicknames used by Lt. Dilworth.<br />The editors should also be credited with a 14 page introduction which helps those unfamiliar with the period understand the backround of the war. There are a few maps and sketches that also add to the book.<br />This is a good, quick read thanks to the diligent work of the editors. This book makes the reader drift into the time period.	2003-11-11

Of the 94 men only 44 returned. (Most of the men died of disease)The two diarists detail interesting info on the deaths of comrades, which might never be known from offical documents.<br />Living conditions, battle descriptions, commentary about leaders, many of which were prominent in the Civil War (McClellan, Hooker, etc), make this book hard to put down. The pranks these guys played are also very amusing to read. These volunteers had quite a time in Mexico!!!<br />There are plenty of footnotes and an annotated roster of Company \\"E\\", plus a helpful index. The book is 331 pages long. No photos & few maps. Suggestions for futher reading are provided.<br />Company \\"E\\" landed at Vera Cruz and fought in the battles from Vera Cruz to Mexico City, then did occupation duty around Mexico City. Daily life, drinking, drill, looting, gambling, bickering, suffering, etc. are all covered. Pvt. Coulter was a scavanger for this group, so he tells about the farms & ranches which he and others raided. Sgt Barclay, later a LT in the 11th US Infantry, gives more of the command & strategic issues, but also tells of the daily routine. (Information from one often supplements the comments of the other.)<br />If you are unfamiliar with the Mexican War, this will be enlightening. For those who have some knowledge this will be a real treat.This book would also be helpful to those who wish to understand Mexican feelings about the war, because the mistreatment of Mexicans and atrocities by both sides are vividly recounted.	2002-04-21

Recent excavations &amp; documentary discoveries make the Mexican uniform depictions incorrect. For one example, shako plates and brestplates have been found which vary greatly from those shown &amp; Piping was not white on coats. Sources of information are largely non-Mexican. Lt.Col. Enrique de la Pena's diary and J.

Author David Paul Smith, has an extensive set of endnotes, index, and bibliography, which make this a great book for those who wish to probe this turbulent period in more detail.<br />The majority of the book deals with the region North and West of Fort Worth, although all of the Western frontier of Texas is covered. The author combines the facts with explanations to cover a period when reliable records are scarce and myth/legend are legion. Particularly impressive are the descriptions of the Elm Creek Raid and Battle of Dove Creek.<br />In addition, Frontier Defense also briefly covers strategy &amp; tactics used before and during the War Between the States.<br />Simplified maps of the frontier districts are included, but a good map of Texas is needed unless the reader is very familiar with the frontier outposts.

The cities are indexed in alphabetical order, but not the men!!!! The units are not indexed, nor is anything else. Are you really going to find men who served in a battle or specific regiment by finding a small town in Texas? A Detailed Map Would Have Been NICE, but wouldn't an index of the names, places, events, etc. have been better?<br />2) The quotes from the men have been shortened and/or deleted. The original work by Miss Yeary had sometimes long, but interesting stories. This booklet has a few stories, but mostly selected one or two sentence quotes. The men who served with the veteran and the battles and specific units are for the most part no place to be found.<br />3) The Civil War was a large and costly conflict, but ONLY THREE BOOKS WERE USED AS REFERENCES. In other words, there isn't much depth.<br />FAMILY HISTORIANS SHOULD AVOID THIS BOOK because it will make those researching their family, ancestor, unit, battle, etc. very angry.<br />CHILDREN OR THOSE WHO WANT AN EXTREMELY LIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF A COMPLEX &amp; DETAILED STRUGGLE MIGHT LIKE THIS POORLY CONSTRUCTED BOOK.<br />THIS IS NOT FOR SCHOLARS!	2001-04-21

There are 171 full color photos, plus an excellent 3-D map.<br />The author, Susan Biagi, covers the history of each building, gives helpful brief tourist information, includes short histories of some of the inhabitants, discusses the sieges, and writes a little about the reconstruction. This is NOT a definitive history of &quot;all&quot; of Louisbourg, but it is a valuable quick history no tourist should be without.<br />For those who reenact or like historical subjects, the photos and cultural info are a big help. Face it, Louisbourg is remote for most, so this is the next best thing to being there and staying warm.<br />The format is like a virtual tour, because each site has a brief history and several photos. Pages are cued to a tourmap/sitemap, so you can pick and choose at will while firmly knowing where you are. Because the author and photographer are locals, their insight on various locations surpasses in depth the typical guidebook.<br />For F&amp; I Reenactors, this is a &quot;must-buy&quot;, like the Osprey books.

There is a detailed order of battle of both land and sea units, plus  some very nice 3 dimensional maps of the terrain.

An index, chronology and suggested further reading, are also included.<br />Rene Chartrand does an excellent job of telling the story in an even-handed way so the reader can appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of both sides of the conflict. There are some very insightful comments and interesting ancedotes on leaders, troops and the times. The book is very readable.<br />Louisbourg is a National Park which includes an extensive, although not complete, recreation of the famous fortress-city. For those who can not visit, for reenactors, wargamers, and those interested in the F&amp;I War this would be an good book to have.<br />The drawbacks are few. Namely the 3-dimensional maps might have been &quot;zoomed-in&quot;, some photos of the park could have been of higher quality, and more tourist information should have been given. In spite of these minor shortcomings, LOUISBOURG 1758: WOLFE'S FIRST SIEGE is highly recommended.	2001-02-08

The journal ends May 6th 1847, but the correspondence continues unitl Dr. Love's return to Columbus Mississippi in Oct 1848.<br />There are NO BATTLES, but the medical situation is covered in depth. Someone familiar with medicine may find this book very interesting, but those unfamiliar with mid-19th century medical terminology may find it a challenge because there is no glossary of terms.<br />This book is good for serious students of the Mexican War as it answers an important mystery. Namely, a unit with an over-abuundance of personnel with medical training had 167 deaths and 134 medical discharges in an extremely short time. The doctors and Col. Ruben Davis, who was also a physican, disagreed among themselves and with others on the causes, but after reading what a descendant of Dr. Love has written the terrible cause comes to light ( I will not spoil the mystery- you'll have to read to the end of the book )<br />The fued is also a topic which might lead readers to read between the lines in a search for truth. Needless to say, Love casts himself as the good guy, but is forthright in telling some of the things said against him and in favor of Col. Davis. The reader can make a judgement, and is almost drawn into the fray by the journal and documents. During the Mexican War conflict was not unique to the 2nd Mississippi, so this can be a good case study.<br />There are a few letters to friends &amp; family, which mention people and events unknown to the reader. The letters to home last a number of pages. Included is Dr. Love's medical theis on Hereditary Transmission from the Medical Univ. of South Carolina, Charleston. These items give insight into Dr. Love, but may not be as exciting to read as the medical crisis and fued.events unknown to the reader. The letters to home last a number of pages.

It covers more monuments than you could possibly see in a visit, so it is great after you've been to Normandy. It would also be handy as you explore  because it gives backround on various sites, as well as eyewitness  accounts. This is a superb guidebook.<br />It would be nice to have a general  knowledge before reading the book, but the authors have also included a  good brief history of Operation Overlord. This is not a detailed account of  D-Day.<br />Maps, photos, eyewitness accounts, limited orders of battle,  troop positions, and info on war graves commissions are given. Emphasis is  on the Allied Powers, although there is some info on the Nazis.<br />This is  a good armchair tour and indespensible guide for your car if visiting.	2000-05-23
