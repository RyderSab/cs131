In the first fourteen books Agatha was an amateur detective solving crimes in her Cotswold village.  After she has an encounter with a pickpocket on a Paris subway, she decides to open her own private detective agency called Raisin Investigations. Most of her early cases are missing cats and teenagers. Then a client hires her to investigate death threats made to her daughter, and the plot begins to thicken.  Agatha is still grappling with getting older and attributes the pain in her hip to a strain as she thinks only old people get arthritis.  She also has a knack for picking unsuitable men; she even has a flirtation with the prime murder suspect.  The plot gets unnecessarily complicated and is somewhat choppy, and this is not the best book in the series.  However, Agatha Raisin fans will still like it.	2005-06-13

These books are light reading and can easily be read in an afternoon.  The plots in all the books are a standard format with all the old characters from Lochdubb, a remote village in northern Scotland, and new characters added to each installment to add interest.  The murder victim in this installment is a soap opera writer with an exaggerated opinion of his talents who offers to teach a writing class to the people of Lochdubb.  He ends up first boring, then insulting, all of them, and his students are the prime suspects when he ends up being murdered.  It's up to Hamish to solve the crime which he does with his usual flair.  The villagers would like to see Hamish marry and settle down, but he always has romantic complications and is accused by one of his romantic interests of being more attached to his dog than he is to her.  This is another good cozy mystery and an enjoyable read.	2005-06-08

There is also a strong emphasis on the Native American women's accounts of their lives and activities.  Of special interest to me were the accounts of women lighthouse keepers and women who worked on the ships that navigate the Great Lakes. This book is highly recommended to anyone with an interest in women's literature and/or the Great Lakes.	2005-05-22

It begins with biographical sketches of both of them from their birth, and this is interwoven with a history of all the comedy films made from the silent days until Laurel and Hardy are eventually paired together in 1927.  After that, it is a complete filmography of all their films, supporting actors in their films, their contemporaries like Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton, their directors, etc. Of greater interest to me was the biographical information on the two comedians whose personal lives were marked by enough marital misadventures to be the subject of one of their famous two-reelers.  Laurel had four wives and eight marriages; he married one wife three times. Just like in their movies, Laurel and Hardy were friends to the end.	2005-01-18

It was nice to discover a biographical book written from a different slant with much of the book relating to Mr. Burrell's history of service in Buckingham Palace before he became butler to the princess. Anyone interested in a behind the scenes look at Buckingham Palace is in for a treat.  This book makes for surprisingly good reading.	2004-11-23

Both of these settings are great, but Montreal is especially appealing and Reichs descriptions of the old streets and neighborhoods of Montreal are very well done.  Temperence deals with three skeletons found buried beneath a pizza parlor in Montreal, a friend's personal crisis, and her own romantic difficulties. This book really moves along and captures the reader.  This is the best of the series so far.	2004-08-08

Some of them were better than others, and the reviews have been mixed on Murder Room, her latest book.  In my opinion, this is one of her best, particularly in terms of setting the scene and character development. One feels one knows the characters, especially Tally Clutton, a housekeeper who lives in a cottage on the grounds of the Dupayne Museum. The Dupayne is a small, family run, specialty museum in London whose fate hangs on all three trustees signing a new lease. This sets the stage for murder.  The museum has a &quot;Murder Room&quot; featuring famous English murders of the 1920s and 30s, and it is where one of the murders takes place.  James writes the classic British mystery, and she has an extraordinary command of the English language.  This book is a must read for her fans.	2004-03-10

Each of them is an entertaining read, and they leave one wondering what is next for Agatha, an amateur detective who lives in a Cotswold Village.  Agatha discovers that her ex-husband, James, who claimed to have left her to join a monastery in France is no longer at the monastery, and it seems that he used the monastery as an excuse to divorce her.  She decides that she is through with men again. However, she has settled into village life and has even found a good friend in Mrs. Bloxsby, the vicar's wife.  Agatha is asked to assist when Mrs. Bloxsby's husband, Alf, is suspected of murdering a good looking and charming new curate. She and her neighbor, mystery writer John Armitage, set off to solve the crime.  John Armitage thinks Agatha is a pushy, selfish woman, but there is more to Agatha than that.

She is a person who has zealously guarded her privacy in spite of having to make rather recent concessions, several in connection with the tragic death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, to the media and the public.  In fact, one of the major themes is the Queen's and the Royal Family's relationship with and use of the media. MONARCH tends to start off slowly, filling over 80 pages with information about past monarchs like Queen Victoria, and tends to be pretty plodding and dry in parts. It appears to be written for a British audience and the same book is apparently titled ROYAL in Britain...	2002-07-11

Daufuskie is close to Hilton Head, but the difference between them is night and day.  While Hilton Head is completely modern and developed, Daufuskie is still natural, beautiful, serene, quiet and tranquil.  Because the 20th century basically ignored this small island, time seems to have stood still.  The students he taught, cut off from modern society, knew almost nothing of events outside their narrow and impoverished life.  Conroy attempted to expose the students to a world outside of the island.  While the main theme is education, a secondary and strong theme is life on the island.  This book is well written.  It was read after my visit to Daufuskie where I saw the school he taught in, and experiencing that really brought the book to life.	2002-05-24

Jerry becomes a victim himself when he is stabbed to death in a movie theater. The stories of the three women, and some supporting characters, are woven together.

Sheila Blackthorne, who also had a premonition that she would die at the age of 35, asked her sister and friends to have Ann Rule write her story if anything ever happened to her.  She feared that her ex-husband, Allen, would kill her eventually.  When she was savagely murdered with her four quadruplet toddlers in the house, those close to her immediately suspected her ex-husband. This book has some flaws. Rule goes into great detail with some of the characters, but Sheila is never really defined except in terms of her relationship to Allen.  The book seems to get bogged down in repetitious details like legal proceedings in the middle, but, like all of Rule's other books, tells a good story.	2002-03-14

Many of her books have a religious theme. This one is set in a seminary on the bleak coast of East Anglia. It features Commander Adam Dalgliesh, well known to her readers and also from the \\"Mystery\\" series on PBS. This book was recently adapted for this PBS program.   James is a master of the plot, but her strength is in developing the characters and making them become real. Some characters were eliminated for the T.V. version, but there were still fifteen suspects, and keeping track of them all isn't easy. In this book, the murderer also becomes known some time before the ending, but the book is so well crafted that it is only a minor flaw in an otherwise brilliant work.	2001-06-07
