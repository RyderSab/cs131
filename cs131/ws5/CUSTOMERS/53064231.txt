It's a warm family story about a pioneer family and the bonds that tied women together.  Afterward she wanted to go out and help me in the garden.  I have several friends about to have babies and this will be just perfect.  The paintings are lovely and evocative.	2004-07-03

This is one.  Both my boys are reluctant readers, and they really enjoyed another series by Hopkinson, Prairie Skies.  When we found SAILING FOR GOLD in her new Klondike Kid trilogy, they were so excited. Well, this one is as good as the last.  Recommended!	2004-07-03

It was on his summer reading list, and it's just at the perfect level for beginning or reluctant readers. Our family is headed for a summer vacation in Seattle, and we can't wait to go to the Klondike National Park in Pioneer Square and imagine what the streets looked like in 1897!	2004-06-27

The author tells the stories of five immigrants to the U.S. and New York City around 1900, but what's amazing is the power of the voices here, plus the photos.  The focus is on young people, but my adult book group read this and loved it. Everyone has seen photos of the crowded Lower East Side, but this book makes you think of the individuals and their families who lived there.	2003-11-11

The Kheel Center at Cornell University has an amazing Internet site devoted to the Triangle Fire as well.  And some of the women who worked at Triangle, including Pauline Newman, went on to become labor organizers.  I am a middle school social studies teacher and recently found a wonderful book for older children and adults called SHUTTING OUT THE SKY LIFE IN THE TENEMENTS OF NEW YORK, which contains a section not only on the Triangle Fire, but on the daily lives of shirtwaist workers and their journeys from Europe to the Lower East Side.	2003-10-25

She loves this book.  The illustrations are fun yet convey a sense of the time period.  And the story is great for reading aloud.  The best part is seeing a photograph of the real Alta Weiss, the Girl Wonder, on the back cover.  That seems to make it real for kids.

As a teacher and as a parent I've often been frustrated as I try to help my kids study for history tests about the pre-Civil War era.  They have to learn about the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but it's just another date to memorize.  But in Hopkinson's new chapter book, kids get a look at what life might have been like then.  The note says she used letters and manuscripts to research the time period, and it shows.  Even though the book is geared for third graders, my fifth grade classroom has enjoyed it too. Highly recommended!	2002-06-02

This is an obviously fictionalized story, but it does include some actual quotes from Farmer's early cookbook.  Nancy Carpenter's illustrations combine Victorian clip art with her own drawings.

Recently I found a children's book, FANNIE IN THE KITCHEN, that tells how Fannie Merritt Farmer may have gotten started in cooking as a mother's helper.  I never realized Farmer suffered from polio or a stroke as a teenager, which made her &quot;unmarriageble&quot; in those days.

About a year after James Ransome's and my children's picture book, SWEET CLARA AND THE FREEDOM QUILT was published in  1993, I received a call from Ms.Tobin, who was searching for information  about quilts and the underground railroad.   Although the inspiration for  Sweet Clara, a work of fiction, came from hearing a quilter on National  Public Radio mention escape routes being sewn into quilts, we had never  found actual documentation or confirmation.  Now, incredibly, it seems that  elements of the story, and the quilt James Ransome painted as Sweet Clara's  escape route, somehow ring true to parts of Ozella McDaniel Williams'  account of slaves using quilts to communicate.	1998-12-30
