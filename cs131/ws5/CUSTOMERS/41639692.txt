Folklore and tall tales have often featured women soldiers disguised as men and working as spies, smugglers, and scouts, but interesting and documented books about the women in the military haven't come out until the last few years. Recent non-fiction books have found that at minimum, 700 women served - disguised as men - in the ranks of the Union and Confederate armies. Some say that number should be closer to a thousand. Scores of women died at Gettysburg, undiscovered until burial. Many nameless women probably served that the history books will never detail.    So it seems timely that author Nann Dunne has created the fictional Sarah-Bren Coulter, a handsome southern woman who cannot resist the pull of the Civil War. Her twin brother stays behind to run the family foundry, and Sarah - disguised as Bren Cordell - becomes a courier-scout for the Confederate Army while spying for the Union. She finds the battles of war unlike anything she ever expected. She sees more blood and death than any person ever should. And then she herself is wounded. Instead of dying, fortune smiles upon her, sending her into the hands of Faith Pruitt, a woman with a young son who lives close to some of the fighting. But safety with Faith is not to last long. Sarah is trapped on the border of Union and Confederate forces-and which should she hold herself out as?    From that point on, the plot turns more desperate as the danger Sarah has tried to escape catches up with her. Her strength, her mental and physical stability, and her ethics will be sorely tested as she deals with the damage that befalls her. Revenge, retribution, murder-and lost love-will weigh heavily on her mind. Will Sarah Coulter be strong enough to deal with her future?    The author has done an excellent job researching the setting and time, while never inundating the reader with ahistory lesson. The drama of the story comes alive because of this. Once the novel is set up, the action is fast-paced with scenes ranging from hate-infused to anguished to terror-stricken, all of which are nicely balanced with scenes of strong friendship, camaraderie, and love. The characters in the book are full-bodied and complex and include sister-in-law Lindsay, whose ongoing support, even in face of her husband's condemnation of Sarah, is balm to Sarah's soul. Her friend Phillip is steadfast in his caring for Sarah in spite of multiple marriage rejections. There is humor and mutual respect between Sarah and her friend Leah, a \\"woman of ill repute\\" whose role in the story is central. Of course Faith, and her son Benjamin, are also critical to this \\"war between the hearts.\\"    Nann Dunne has created an unforgettable heroine, a woman before her time, standing at the crux of a new age. This fast-paced and gripping story will keep you up late at night. Highly recommended. Don't miss it! ~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review and author of the \\"Gun\\" Series and other books	2005-06-01

Now in her mid-30s, she has been taking time to reflect upon all the havoc she has wreaked in her career as a hired assassin and bounty hunter. She has committed a lot of reprehensible acts--done things that few people would ever forgive, least of all herself. Even after having walked away five years earlier from her violent life, she is still in danger because someone - most likely her former employer - has put out a million-dollar contract on her life. So Hunter is not safe at all, and her life is suddenly in grave danger when she is out in the woods deer hunting one day, and her newfound compassion causes her to stop on a lonely road and help a car crash victim who turns out to have been traveling in a stolen car.  <br /> <br />The woman Hunter takes in \\"looked to be about twenty-five, ten years younger than Hunter, and she was probably quite attractive, but it was hard to tell for sure at the moment. Bandages hid much of her face and the areas that were exposed were puffy and bruised. Her nose had been broken, blackening both eyes, and there was a small lump behind one ear. Her shoulder-length blond hair was matted with dried blood, and a three-inch gash on her forehead had been closed with several neat stitches of dental floss. Her left arm was set with a makeshift splint, her left knee was wrapped in an Ace bandage and her rib cage had been tightly taped\\" (p. 11).  <br /> <br />\\"Jake\\" finds herself in that beat-up situation when she wakes up in a dark place, attended by a strange woman, and unable to remember her name or how she came there. She cannot recall anything about her past, but she feels certain she knows Hunter, who is in turn quite sure she has never met Jake. The injured woman's certainty that she recognizes Hunter seems to furnish proof that Jake is the bounty hunter gunning for her, and this makes things difficult because in the scant amount of time the two women spend together, an attraction catches hold and sparks begin to fly. <br /> <br />But HUNTER'S PURSUIT is not primarily a romance, though it contains a romantic sub-plot. After the initial set-up, the bulk of the book is action-adventure as Hunter tries to escape detection by other bounty hunters, all of whom want the million dollar prize. Unlike her past solitude past, however, Hunter now has the injured Jake to defend, and as every hour goes by, Hunter grows more determined to protect her.  <br /> <br />The story is full of twists and turns, suspense, and a deepening mystery that is not resolved until the final couple chapters. Who is after Hunter? Who is Jake? Can they trust one another? The writing is crisp, especially as the tension mounts in the second half of the book. HUNTER'S PURSUIT is a terrific action/thriller from a promising new writer, and I highly recommend the story.  ~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review and author of the \\"Gun\\" Series	2005-06-01

Love and relationships, conflict and oddities abound in this well-written collection of thoughtful and interesting pieces.  <br /> <br />With a keen eye toward human nature, Hart's new story collection paints a rich and colorful picture of life on the margins. Two of my favorites are about an angry lesbian daughter in conflict with her mother in \\"Grandmother's Cup\\" and a frightening and realization-filled flight from Halifax to Toronto in \\"Nine Minutes.\\" The book ends with a lovely novella, \\"The Lion and the Lamb.\\" <br /> <br />Because Hart is an old-fashioned storyteller of the very highest order, each offering is solid and engrossing, relying more upon character development, careful plotting, and seamless writing than on stylistic flash. She writes lovely sentences and scenes, at times elegant, at times whimsical or witty, all of which affect the reader in surprising and delightful ways and often with unexpected consequences. The power of most of these ten stories is cumulative. By the time you arrive at the middle of the volume, you will already be regretting that there is an end in sight.  <br /> <br />Each of these stories is dazzling and inventive, with the underlying promise of something utterly unexpected waiting just up ahead. Don't miss this short story collection. It's one of the best of 2005. ~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review and author of Stepping Out: Short Stories <br />	2005-06-01

Books	5	15	17	N	N	Midwest Book Review: April 2005 Issue	From the very first entry, \\"Some Starving Artists Deserve To Starve,\\" Elaura Niles gets straight to the point. She tells about when she was first a novice writer and attended a presentation given at the local library by a literary agent named Carolyn Swayze. Niles was certain that if she could \\"just find a way to talk to Ms. Swayze privately, tell her my story, I was positive she would want to see the book. I was so convinced of this that I brought all 487 single-spaced, red-inked, coffee-stained pages along with me\\" (p. 16). Instead of a private consult with the agent, by the end of the evening Niles realized \\"I lost my writing virginity and realized I was a `crackpot writer'\\" (p. 17). As a result of what she learned from the literary agent, Niles researched the ins and outs of the publishing business. She realized that she could share loads of information with writers, and this book came to fruition.  <br /> <br />In a clear, often cutting and usually humorous manner, Niles explains why so many writers do not get published and what they can do to improve their odds. Most of the reasons writers don't get their books in print have to do with the major gaffes they commit. So, for instance, Niles tells us \\"Many Writers Fail Because They Are Trying to Sell in the Wrong Markets,\\" and she offers an amazingly simple solution: Get out of the house and 1) go to the local bookstore; 2) imagine a book like yours; 3) go find it; 4) look around at what section you are in. Quite simply she says, \\"That's your market\\" (p. 34).  <br /> <br />Whether providing a list of Pros and Cons about the different types and styles of publishers or describing what makes a good query letter, Niles is delightfully brief and funny, more to the point than most other \\"How-To\\" books. She writes about the fact that \\"Hiring A Pro Doesn't Guarantee Success\\" and that \\"Some Agents are Dishonest from the Get-Go.\\" She often provides resource information, for instance for organizations such as the Association of Author Representatives and the Writers Guild of America.    <br /> <br />I found myself laughing out loud at times as I read. It's an odd shaped little book, about 6-by-6 inches, but the graphics, sidebars, and quotations are great! I particularly enjoyed the first quote, from Frank Lloyd Wright: \\"I'm all in favor of keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of fools. Let's start with typewriters\\" (p. 15).  <br /> <br />Having worked slush piles for two publishers, I can attest to the fact that the advice Niles gives is accurate and insightful. This is exactly the type of book that should be read by any new writer or by anybody having trouble getting work accepted. I know that I wasn't aware of a number of the \\"brutal truths\\" early in my career, and any writer will be helped by reading Niles' no-nonsense advice. \\"Truth 6: Writers Are Like Popcorn: Publishers Buy Them by the Bucket and Eat Them by the Handful\\" (p. 41). If you want to avoid being a temporary popcorn snack-or being passed over for some other treat-read this book.  ~Lori L. Lake, independent reviewer, Midwest Book Review	2005-03-30

He was outed in the previous book, and he faced up to the ramifications of that, some of which continue on in the form of low-level verbal abuse from other students. \\"I'd put up with this kind of crap ever since we'd gone public with our Gay-Straight-Bisexual Alliance, and frankly I was getting pretty tired of it. Yeah, yeah, sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me. First of all, anyone who thinks that words can't hurt you has obviously never taken sophomore P.E. And second, did it ever occur to whoever wrote that stupid adage that hurtful words might be a pretty good indication that sticks and stones are on the way?\\" (p. 2).  <br /> <br />From the start, it's clear that Russel has a good sense of humor and that he is strong enough to weather the ups and downs of his newly admitted gay status. But that doesn't mean it's easy, so he is glad that summer arrives, and he is heading off to be a camp counselor with his best friends Min and Gunnar. He figures they'll goof off, swim, play games with kids, and generally have a great time. No one need ever know he's gay. What a surprise to find out how wrong he is! <br /> <br />For the first two-week camp session, Russel is assigned a cabin of ten-year-old boys, all of whom are burn survivors. They go on the rampage almost immediately. At first Russel is inclined to cut them far too much slack because he pities them, but he quickly loses control. Some of the early laughs in the book come from his internal musings about what brats they all are and how helpless he feels trying to keep them in line. Pity doesn't help; he has to learn to treat them the same as other kids and hold them to the same standards.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, he doesn't see that much of Min and Gunnar, but he does meet one of the other counselors, Web Bastian, who is a real looker. Unfortunately, Min is also enamored with Web, and Russel's friendship with Min could be at risk. In fact, his friendship with Gunnar suffers some slings and arrows, too, and Russel is at wit's end. Only Otto, another counselor who attended the camp when he was younger and is also a burn survivor, is a steadying force for Russel.  <br /> <br />The story reads very much like a teenager is narrating it. At the same time, Russel has an intuitive side to him that is a delight. His strong heart shines through every chapter of the book as he learns that scars-both internal and external-as well as secrets can bring people together and tear them apart as well. Hartinger shares the weaknesses in his well-written teenage character as well as his strengths. By showing the discrimination toward both gay youth and toward the scarred burn victims, the author makes it clear that any kind of unfairness, any kind of pain is hard on kids, and only by banding together for support can it be transcended. <br /> <br />This is a funny, touching novel about the continued growth and self-awareness that one young man attains during what should be ordinary summer camp events, but are really quite extraordinary experiences. Russel is the kind of character you wished you knew in real life, and this is a book that stays with you long after you've finished it. With this third novel from Brent Hartinger, I can see that he is an author who is only becoming more accomplished in his writing style, and I look forward to many years of reading his work. This book is highly recommended for all youth, ages 13 to 113. ~Lori L. Lake, independent reviewer, Midwest Book Review <br />	2005-03-30

The day she came out-with the support of her ex-hippie, heterosexual, single parent mother-was the day a lot of the kids began shunning her. But not Elliot, the only other gay student. And not Amina, a straight girlfriend who sticks by her through thick and thin. Romey still feels isolated, particularly because there are no other lesbian kids to hang out with. Amina and Elliot are dear to her, but she wonders if she'll ever meet that special young woman. <br /> <br />Julie Wright is unknown to Romey. A gifted singer and student, Julie is home-schooled by her deeply devout Christian parents. When the book opens, Julie's dad, reverend of the Divido Bible Church, is at the local school board meeting damning homosexual teachers. Meanwhile, his only child is at home lying on her bed letting \\"moonshine in the window and along her body. She felt that liquid sensation, new to her these past months, blushing over her again. She had a private name for it: Yearning\\" (p. 23). Nearly age 15, she is \\"old enough to understand what her dad's sermons had to say about her own life. To Julie, the sermon said that this new Yearning was her own special blessing, chosen for her by Jesus. Its mystery would be revealed in time, or not. Either way, she would thank Jesus for the inner joy bestowed upon her, welcome Yearning, and protect it\\" (p. 26).  <br /> <br />It is inevitable that Julie and Romey should meet, and despite their youth, they both feel the \\"Yearning.\\" At first seeing one another requires only a little sneaking around, but soon they are facing major obstacles. It doesn't take long before Julie's parents do everything they can to keep the two apart. But the depth of feeling that develops between the two girls can't be denied. Their actions set off a string of unexpected events that shock everyone in town and cause change and disaster. And with so much against them, can the love of these young women survive? <br /> <br />MacLean uses beautiful language and a tight plot that moves along with all due speed toward the startling denouement. The novel's structure and prose are flawless. One of my favorite scenes contains this description: \\"Romey ran into the soft night. With every stride, she sensed the moment when both of her feet were off the ground, that moment she was airborne. It was a way to trick relentless old gravity, which, unlike a parent, never lets its attention wander for even half a second, but obsessively keeps you pinned down. Without engine or wings, for moment after moment, perhaps a fifth of every stride, a minute out of every five, twelve whole minute out of every running hour, she was flying. Gliding on air\\" (p. 64). The novel is packed full of fine writing. It's by turns serious and also funny in places. With a fine group of secondary characters, this book has it all: compelling plot, unpredictable storyline, and a knockout ending. <br /> <br />The mark of a truly fantastic story is that when you finish reading the book, off and on for days you remember the characters and explore alternatives for each person's future. When you are finished with this expert debut novel, you will find ROSEMARY AND JULIET has left an indelible mark in your memory. Don't miss this one. ~Lori L.

The circumstances of that prologue don't connect up for some time, but the shadow of the kidnapping hangs over the events that follow. In the present day, Jane Lawless is called to the location of a wedding her staff is catering. The guests are behaving oddly, and it quickly becomes clear that they've been poisoned with something hallucinogenic. The police come, and the wedding guests are rushed to the hospital, but not before the Nick, the bridegroom, is badly injured diving into an empty swimming pool. Jane is frantic. Not only is she upset that people have been injured after eating her catered food, but she also fears lawsuits. Who would do such a terrible thing? She can't believe her workers would have anything to do with it. Why has she been targeted? <br /> <br />Alden Clifford, the groom's father, is a high school teacher, and he comes to the forefront as it becomes apparent that the attack might be connected to him and not about Jane at all. Six months earlier he had tried to prevent a school shooting, and the boy with the gun eventually shot and killed himself. Allegations about Alden's relationship with the boy come out, and Jane begins to wonder if this has made Alden the intended target. Nothing is immediately resolved, and Jane and The Lyme House are under police investigation. Jane turns to her best friend, Cordelia, but Cordelia has her own problems: namely a toddler dumped upon her doorstep by her sister. The little niece and Cordelia offer some great comic moments, and Cordelia, all by herself, is always funny. She refuses to ride in Jane's new Mini Cooper, calling it the \\"Daisy Duck-mobile.\\" Instead she has bought herself a green Hummer, a useful purchase which becomes clear later in the novel. <br /> <br />With an intricately interwoven plot, Hart rolls out perfectly timed scenes and details.The tension builds as the injury and death count increases. The author has never been better and does a marvelous job weaving in a compelling back story with the events of the present. She draws the reader in to this complex structure and doesn't let go until the final denouement some three hundred pages later. It's a gripping and compelling story. By the time the reader reaches the end, an intimate ghost has truly made its haunting presence known. Highly recommended. ~Lori L.

Maisel's latest, COACHING THE ARTIST WITHIN, is no exception. Drawing on his experience as a psychotherapist, author, and creativity coach, Maisel has developed a book that creative people from all realms can use.  <br /> <br />From the first examples in the Introduction through the twelve chapters of advice and information, anyone practicing an art will find solid help and inspiration. Chapters on self-coaching, creating while in the middle of things, dealing with anxiety, achieving balance and centeredness, and maintaining a creative life are particularly excellent. Maisel also provides the reader with 22 exercises, all of which provide food for thought and could easily jumpstart authors or artists who are blocked or at a crossroads with their work.  <br /> <br />Inspiring, challenging, and entertaining, the book is compulsively easy to read and jam-packed full of the kind of teaching and coaching that every creative person needs. I can't recommend it highly enough. Maisel includes an Appendix for anyone interested in becoming a Creativity Coach. At the end he also lists a Resource section of all of his own writings that support the teachings within this book. Taken all together, this volume is a wonderful addition to the library of anyone interested in furthering their creativity. ~Lori L.

Rural Holmstead County is a far cry from the \\"clubs, coffee houses, book stores, chic little storefronts crammed with modern design\\" (p.1), but it's where Brent grew up. And it's where he happens upon Nick. <br /> <br />Nick is a handsome, extremely well-built stonemason engaged to marry an Irish immigrant. She seeks citizenship, not love. He's not interested in a relationship anyway. After being badly burned in his last relationships with a man named Alex, Nick \\"buried his dream of finding an equal. A partner. He became disciplined. Trained his body. Trained his mind. He declared he would never fall in love\\" (p. 11). He's become practical and rather jaded.  <br /> <br />But of course, upon meeting one another, sparks fly-even if Nick is repulsed by Brent at first and won't admit it the attraction. He doesn't see Brent as someone worthy of a relationship and figures him for the \\"wham-bam-thank-you-man\\" type. And besides, Nick is getting married! <br /> <br />What follows is a classic romance fraught with perils and pitfalls and the angst and reluctance of a man with a broken heart. Will these two men manage to see beyond the opposites that they present to one another and find love? The tension runs high, the love scenes are hot, and the story is refreshing within this age-old genre. NICK OF TIME is a fun and entertaining read. ~Lori L.

Isabelle comes from a family of former hippies who are Peace Corps volunteering, eccentric geniuses. Free spirits and emotionally open, Isabelle's household is warm and inviting, and they are not concerned that she has professed a liking for girls.  <br /> <br />Erik's household and life are very opposite from Isabelle's. His father and brother are both Marines, and his household runs with military precision, including their meals being called \\"rations\\" and their beds made only with hospital corners. \\"Erik tried to conform by studying his father and brother's actions and language, but he never seemed to be able to mimic convincingly what came naturally to them. There was a softness in his demeanor that couldn't be ordered out....The gentleness in his hazel eyes refused to be hardened. His father saw and despised this softness\\" (p. 9). That \\"softness\\" is disguised as much as possible by Erik because he is gay.  <br /> <br />This book follows the trials and tribulations of these two young people in their first year of high school. The author has planned four books, one for each year of school, to show the ups and down Erik and Isabelle go through. The writing is clear, to the point, and accessible to teens while not being overly simplistic for the adult reader. Kim Wallace has written a realistic and hopeful book that will be enjoyable for anyone, gay or straight. ~Lori L.

He has been assigned to the lowliest muck duty far longer than others his age, and he can't help but feel shame. He also can't help that he is a clumsy, near-sighted runt, and his cousin Porak and his buddies never let him forget it. Only in his fantasies is Jig a brave and respected warrior, and he longs for the chance to prove himself.  <br /> <br />Finally Jig is given the opportunity to guard the mountain tunnels from intruders, which is a scary proposition since so many of the tunnel guards wind up dead. He resolves to do what needs to be done in order to stay alive. Imagine his surprise when he is accosted by a party of treasure hunters made up of two humans, a dwarf, and an elf who are searching for the Rod of Creation thought to be guarded by a dragon named Straum.  <br /> <br />Jig is forced to join them for the hunt-or die. \\"Jig knew what a real hero would do. A hero would scream something defiant, wrestle Darnak's club away and use it against the dwarf and the human. A hero might even slay them both before making his escape. Of course, Jig knew all the goblin songs, so he knew what happened to goblin heroes.... He had not desire to be a hero. He only wanted to go home, curl up with a hot bowl of lizard-egg soup, and feed dead cockroaches to Smudge\\" (p. 25). <br /> <br />The prospect of making such a journey successfully with his captors doesn't look good to Jig. He doesn't even know where Straum's lair is, but instead of mounting what would be a suicide attack, Jig reluctantly agrees to help the adventurers find their way around the tunnels. What follows is a series of action-filled, entertaining, and often funny adventures as they battle hobgoblins, worms, a necromancer, and various other foes.  <br /> <br />This book will appeal to both adults and young adults. Teens will very much enjoy Jig's quest and his attempt to define himself in a world that doesn't necessarily value his skills. Adults will also enjoy the humor and the upending of various aspects of the fantasy/quest genre. Prepare to be entertained throughout and completely satisfied with Jig's journey by the time you reach the end. ~Lori L.

Sixteen-year-old Jeru, the youngest of three brothers, finds his life is turned upside down by a plague that has beset the land of Omoham. Before the onset of the panic, Jeru worked the family farm and dreamed at night of a shadowy man. His life was fairly simple, though it didn't feel complete. Now everyone in the region is fleeing in fear. Jeru's brothers and parents have already left the farm, but Jeru has chosen not to accompany them. Instead, he goes south, to Cinatis, in an effort to discover what is causing the plague and to try to discover why he feels such a disturbance in the earth. Jeru's special gift is as a stone felder. He can feel in the stones under his feet that something evil is quite literally affecting the land. <br /> <br />One thing that becomes apparent as Jeru makes his pilgrimage south is that as fast as his countrymen leave Omoham, the neighboring Ch'turks come in and take over their land and holdings. This doesn't seem right. Then on the road long before he even reaches Cinatis, Jeru is attacked by Ch'turk rogues. Jeru is saved from death by Eril, a mysterious young man who Jeru soon realizes is the one who has been haunting his dreams. The two discover they are soul-mates and form a strong bond. They continue on the journey to Cinatis only to find that things are worse than they had imagined. The Ch'turk's religious orders have posted new rules for the society that can only be described as joyless, discriminatory, regimented, and fundamentalist. They've outlawed relationships like Eril and Jeru's, as well as disallowed the use of any sort of earth gifts, stonefelding included. Jeru's abilities are not ones he has ever had to hide-or refrain from using-and everything about this is wrong and unnatural for him. The penalty for not following these new rules, though, is death.  <br /> <br />At the urging and with the assistance of other powerful characters, Jeru and Eril set out on a quest to learn the truth, and it is this journey of exploration that encompasses Book One of the \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" trilogy. The next book will be called GWI'S WAR and is due out very soon, with the third book, WAR AMONG THE GODS, to come later in 2005.  <br /> <br />I've been meaning to read this book for a long time, but it is a big one - 585 pages - and that seemed a little daunting. Once I started it, however, it rolled along smoothly, revealing layer upon layer of information about a captivating world at the precipice of change. Jeru is a worthy protagonist, and his relationship with Eril is richly drawn. The villains are appropriately villainous, the \\"good guys\\" are engaging, and the land in which this epic plot takes place is fascinating. I very much look forward to the next installment of this series. ~Lori L. Lake, reviewer for Midwest Book Review and author of the \\"Gun\\" series <br />	2005-01-27

What I got far exceeded my expectations. I was enchanted from the first words, and I could hardly wait to read as many of these pieces as I could gulp down each night. When I finished, I was unhappy it was all consumed. I wanted more.<br /><br />The book is a cornucopia of variety. There are serious essays, playful performance pieces, literary commentary, a long and wonderful poem entitled \\"The Writer on, and at, Her Work,\\" and even some sketches LeGuin has done. The volume is separated into four sections: Personal Matters, Readings, Discussions & Opinions, and On Writing. The first section gives the reader a glimpse of who Ursula LeGuin is. She talks a bit of her family, of her parents' occupations (anthropologist father and biographer mother), and of her love of libraries and islands-imaginary and real. The next two sections cover all sorts of topics. Whether she was discussing awards and gender or the submerged humor of Mark Twain's \\"Diaries of Adam and Eve\\" or literacy or rhythm in the works of JRR Tolkien, I felt I was in sure hands. I must admit that I expected the essay, \\"Stress-Rhythm in Poetry and Prose\\" to be deadly dull. Instead, I was surprised beyond my wildest imagination to find that for the first time in my entire life, someone had actually explained meter and rhythm so that it made complete sense to me. I had one of those \\"Aha!\\" moments, suddenly understanding it in a way that I had never quite managed. (So _that_ is how iambic pentameter works so effectively!) I've been raving ever since about rhythm to all who will listen.<br /><br />I like the fact that LeGuin does not hesitate to address sexism, homophobia, and unfairness. Her piece entitled \\"Unquestioned Assumptions\\" is masterful. She talks about the four common varieties of unquestioned assumption (We're all men, white, straight, and Christian), and then adds a fifth which she explores at length: We're all Young. Her analysis of these issues alone was worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The final section of the book is about writing and was my favorite section. LeGuin addresses many angles of craft and technique. The name of the book, THE WAVE IN THE MIND, refers to an explanation of style that Virginia Woolf once wrote in a letter. Concerning what rhythm is, Woolf had written, \\"A sight, an emotion, creates this wave in the mind...and then, as it breaks and tumbles in the mind, it makes words to fit it\\" (p. xii).  LeGuin obviously agrees with this. She writes that \\"every novel has its characteristic rhythm. And that if the writer hasn't listened for that rhythm and followed it, the sentences will be lame, the characters will be puppets, the story will be false. And that if the writer can hold to that rhythm, the book will have some beauty. What the writer has to do is listen for that beat, hear it, keep to it, not let anything interfere with it. Then the reader will hear it too, and be carried by it\\" (p. 183). This is sage advice.<br /><br />All of LeGuin's ideas and advice-every chapter of it-is wonderful. I loved this: \\"Trust your story; trust yourself; trust your readers-but wisely. Trust watchfully, not blindly. Trust flexibly, not rigidly. The whole thing, writing a story, is a high-wire act-there you are out in midair walking on a spiderweb line of words, and down in the darkness people are watching. What can you trust but your sense of balance?\\" (p. 234).<br /><br />The examples, stories, and allusions throughout are clear and strong and elegant. Her Voice is powerful and wise, humorous and reflective. Ursula LeGuin quite clearly displays true genius. This is a book to savor, to keep, to read again and again over the years. I cannot recommend it highly enough. ~Lori L. Lake, reviewer for Midwest Book Reviewand author of the \\"Gun\\" seriesBook Review and author of the \\"Gun\\" series <br />	2005-01-27

Traveling from Michigan to dispose of the old monstrosity sounds like a lot of extra work, and Dhari's life is already far too full. Her time and energy are taken up by her job as a grant-writer for an AIDS coalition, a less-than-committed girlfriend, and serious problems in her family of origin. Little does she know that she's at the crossroads of change and is about to be sorely tested by new experiences. <br /> <br />Erin Hughes, a professor well-versed in Civil War era architecture and history is brought in to assess Anna Grayson's house, and Dhari feels an unexpected attraction to her. Dhari also meets the elderly Nessie Tinker, descendant of the slaves who worked the land in the 1800s and who eventually became landowners and neighbors to the Graysons. Nessie served as caretaker and friend to Anna Grayson, and unbeknownst to Dhari and Erin, Nessie knows many of the secrets of the past-some of which go all the way back to Civil War times-that the two women are exploring. <br /> <br />Dhari is gradually drawn in to the mysteries of the old house and its former occupants, but at the same time, her wandering girlfriend and mentally ill mother back in Michigan exert pressures upon her that keep her stressed and worried. Dhari has her own secrets, and as the story is revealed, the reader gradually comes to understand the depth of her pain and the extent to which she has gone to prevent anyone from knowing about it-even her girlfriend. When she lets slip to Erin some vital details, Dhari is appalled. \\"She'd been first-time lucky that Erin Hughes thinks the bones in her own closet shine just as bright white as hers. Most people, however, aren't that honest. They lock their skeletons up behind propriety and self-protection and make choices that to the casual observer seem entirely normal. Just like Dhari Weston. It's the closer inspection, the one that rattles the door, that has to be avoided\\" (p. 103).  <br /> <br />The ways that Dhari ends up \\"rattling that door\\" make for an engrossing read. The book itself is slight, but the issues raised and the secrets revealed make for powerful and unforgettable reading. This book was entertaining, and the way the pieces all came together was ultimately quite satisfying. Read it for the tight plot, for the mystery, for the romance, and don't miss this engaging story. ~Lori L. Lake, reviewer for Midwest Book Review and author of the \\"Gun\\" series <br />	2005-01-27

In this third novel in the Marshall \\"Mars\\" Bahr series, author K.J. Erickson has delivered a terrific plot, engaging characters, and a nail-biter finish that comes out of left field. Mars is in his final days as the lead detective assigned to a special unit created by the previous police chief. Because of a regime change in the department, Mars and his intelligent assistant Nettie are happy to be moving to the Cold Case Unit at the State's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. But one last murder intervenes.  <br /> <br />The wife of flashy basketball star, Tayron \\"T-Jack\\" Jackman has been viciously murdered in her home. Mars intuitively knows that Jackman must be responsible for Terri DuCain Jackman's death. He very quickly learns that T-Jack  was obsessively controlling and brutal toward his wife, beating her regularly. Unfortunately, at the time of the murder, the cocky ball player was with Terri's wealthy parents wrapping up a one hundred million dollar deal in which he would divorce Terri and walk away. Not only does he get the hundred mil, but upon his wife's death, he also gets the five-year-old daughter whom he doesn't ever plan to let Terri's stricken parents see. <br /> <br />Everyone involved in the investigation believes Jackman arranged to kill his wife, but proving it is another matter. It doesn't help that the new chief of police is a nincompoop or that Mars is soon struggling with departmental politics of the worse kind. Dead bodies start surfacing, and simultaneously, issues with Mars' ex-wife and son, Chris, crop up and cause a very harried Mars to sweat the impending deadline to close the case.  <br /> <br />With Erickson's dynamite cast of characters and an engrossing plot that won't quit, this book is a real page-turner. Erickson has herself a wonderful new franchise that could go on a long time in much the same way that John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series has. I can't wait to read the fourth book in the series, ALONE AT NIGHT. ~Lori L.

Kate had been outed and had lost her TV anchor job, but Jay was still in the closet. Now, in this sequel, Kate has become the Director of Public Information for the New York state correctional system. She takes some flak for being lesbian, but her relationship with Jay is still not known by anyone outside their circle of friends. <br /> <br />Jay has continued with her journalism career, and at first all seems well, but very quickly it becomes clear that rocky times are ahead. Not only are there dastardly forces at work behind the scenes that are undermining Kate and her job, but Jay cannot depend on her anonymity being guarded. Then there is a struggle for power at the highest levels of the state and federal government, and certain individuals are willing to sabotage or quite literally dispose of Kate to gain political advantage. Neither Kate nor Jay know how devious and destructive those forces will be, but even though it gradually dawns upon Kate that she is being more than undermined, she is not prepared for the lengths to which desperate men will go. It will take all her physical and emotional strength to get through the disaster that occurs-and Jay will be tested, too. <br /> <br />Author Lynn Ames maintains the excitement of the two women's growing relationship while making sure that the romance and hot love scenes don't derail the action side of the plot. An exciting romantic thriller, THE COST OF COMMITMENT will keep you awake late into the night wondering how Jay and Kate can possibly get out of the mess they find themselves in.

US	41639692	R1Q53YPA3AWQZO	0964109964	315138860	The Front Runner: A Novel	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Stunning Story--Packs a Punch Three Decades Later!	In late 1974, 39-year-old Harlan Brown is living quietly, employed as a track coach at a small college in upstate New York.  He's been through a lot in those 39 years, much of which we discover later in the narrative from Harlan himself, who is the first person narrator.  But on that winter day, Harlan is in for the shock of his life when the college administrator sends three young transfer athletes to try out for the track team.  These are not just any young men; they're all three gay-as is the deeply closeted Harlan-and they've been thrown off a big-time college team because of their sexuality.  Billy Sive is one of the three, and it's his spirit and strength that suffuse the book with gradually increasing power and wonder.  Billy is a front runner, the man in the footrace who runs hard and fast as he can, attempting to stave off his competitors.  He has great talent, which Harlan believes he can bring out if only the young man will listen to his coaching. <br /> <br />And so begins the story of two men as they struggle with the feelings that grow between them.  Eventually they become lovers united in partnership and with the goal to go for Olympic gold while trying to find a place of acceptance in a world that is not nearly as accepting as it is today.  Graphic and gritty at times, the story of their attraction and relationship is also tender and powerful.  Millions of gay men and women, not to mention many straight people, from all over the world have read The Front Runner.  Whether you're straight or gay-or anywhere in between-the story is compelling.   <br /> <br />Patricia Nell Warren, writing this story in the early 1970's, could not have foreseen the ripple effect it had upon gays and lesbians in America and around the world.  Other books had been written about homosexual experience, but when this one was first published in 1974, it had a stunning effect and still packs a punch.  The Front Runner took hold of a Gay Hero Archetype and made it real, while atthe same time causing the reader to feel deeply about characters who seemed so genuinely appealing and authentic, they could almost walk off the page.   <br /> <br />This book is nearing 30 years old, and yet it still rings true.  Still feels real.  Still packs a wallop.  Patricia Nell Warren was very nearly prescient in her treatment of the Gay Heroes in this novel.  Since The Front Runner's publication, we have seen the emergence of gay pride and solidarity that had only just begun in 1969 with the Stonewall Riots.  Since then, from Harvey Milk's 1977 ascendance to political power in California and subsequent assassination to the bravery of gay rugby player Mark Bingham in helping to avert disaster in the Flight 93 attack on September 11th, our nation has gotten glimpses of the strength, beauty, and contributions of gay people who put their lives on the line for the good of an ideal.  And I like to think that above it all, the ghost of Billy Sive hovers: \\"He had overcome the fury by nonviolence and compassion.  He was out front, running free.  He was accepted for what he was.  He was even valued now, as someone who might speak for a whole universe of human feeling that had been denied.  It was so ironic...\\"     <br /> <br />Though it's been 20 years since I first read this book, time has been good to it, infusing it with both a prophetic voice and a elegiac tone that would not be so powerful if prejudice and hate were not still so prevalent.  The world has come a long way in the last three decades, but not far enough.  There are still far too many Matthew Shepards and Jamie Naboznys.  Until the world is tolerant and accepting, The Front Runner will continue to speak to all of us.  I recommend this book highly.  All of straight America should be required to read it. ~Lori L.

US	41639692	R2CLE7MTKW534Z	0952362538	647823941	The World Celaeno Chose	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Rich, Glorious Prose, and a Spell-Binding World & Characters	In the Temple in the city of Fairfield, a young woman named Lynn does the important work of helping women reproduce. She is a sort of psychic DNA-knitting doctor/priest called an imprinter. Imprinters are chosen very young for their psychic abilities and are taken from the families to serve Celaeno, the great goddess of the people. Everything about Lynn's world is focused on prayer, imprinting, and the teachings of Celaeno. The imprinting skill she shares brings in a fortune in \\"offerings\\" (required by the Church) from eager women desperate for children.. There is no separation of Church and State; they are one and the same.    After a couple of decades of this mind-numbing, psychologically draining work, the book opens with Lynn in a state of depression. Once a month during a religious ritual on the steps of the Temple, she sees the outdoors. Otherwise, she is locked into the tomb-like environment of the Temple, never to have a lover, never to have freedom, never to know anything but this life of service. She is basically held captive, a prisoner of her own abilities-until the day Sister Smith, from the larger Temple in Landfall, appears and wrangles with the authorities to take the talented imprinter far away to the larger, more powerful Temple. Lynn is excited to make the long journey during which, perhaps for the last time, she can enjoy the forests, the freedom to walk on the woodland paths and see the moon, and the cool air at night.     A squadron of Rangers, including Lt. Kimberly Ramon, is quickly assigned to escort the Sisters and Lynn on the long journey over the mountains and to the south. And this is where the adventure begins. For the first time since childhood, Lynn is among real and interesting women, and she is quite taken with Ramon, who has her own secrets and griefs. \\"As much as anything, Lynn enjoyed the honest, open banter, although the jokes were frequently bawdy. To Lynn's mind they were fair less offensive than the conversation of the sisters; the intimidation by pious quotes, the political backstabbing disguised in religious platitudes. The soldiers spoke of a world Lynn would never know, but it didn't matter. Their stories were like breathing fresh air after years of choking in incense\\" (p. 90).     The soldiers are also brave, and when they are attacked on the journey, everything about the trip changes. Lynn's ability to envision herself as a free woman begins to grow. But can she shake free of the grip of the Church? How far will the powers-that-be go in order to keep her to themselves?     This fundamentalist society, operating based upon bits and pieces of lore, abridged history, inaccurate facts, and misguided good intentions, is all the more frightening because it is peopled only by women. In Fletcher's world of Celaeno, it's not men with the compulsion to render matters of life into simplistic and often bone-crushing black and white; women can be and are just as dangerous.     With rich, glorious prose, Jane Fletcher has created a spell-binding world and a variety of fascinating and multi-dimensional characters. The world is so compelling that I couldn't help but wish I could quite literally go there! Lynn's quest, as well as that of Kim Ramon, makes for exciting reading. At its heart, the book is an adventure/quest, but it is also a mystery. Who are these people? Where did they come from? What happened to the men, if, indeed, there ever were any? The back story of the previous 533 years is unraveled slowly, but surely, for the reader so that by the end of the book, all is revealed.     THE WORLD CELAENO CHOSE is absorbing and engrossing tale-telling of the highest order, and the really exciting thing is that although this novel is complete and \\"finished,\\" the door is left open to explore more of this world, which the author has apparently done in subsequent books. I can't wait to read the next Celaeno volumes, and this book is a keeper that I will re-read again and again. I highly recommend it.	2004-12-02

In this, the fourth novel in the \\"Honor\\" series, author Radclyffe continues the story of the relationship between Blair Powell, the daughter of the president of the United States, and Cameron \\"Cam\\" Roberts, the Secret Service agent assigned to protect her. As with each of the previous books, HONOR GUARDS picks up where the last novel (LOVE AND HONOR) left off. When the novel opens, Blair has already given an interview to a reporter revealing her sexual orientation and her lover's identity, and she and Cam are waiting for the story to be printed and for the media blitz that is sure to follow. In the brief time before that happens, they are able to be together as lovers, luxuriating in one another's arms and trying to block out the rest of the world to focus on their relationship. <br /> <br />But little do they know that behind the scenes, malignant forces are at work, including a conspiracy to assassinate Blair. Radclyffe has set this book from August 16, 2001 and onward toward the inevitability of the 9/11 attacks. Interspersing the two lover's daily struggles with politics, privacy, and the paparazzi are brief details of the conspiracy to unseat the government by way of terrorism. Every step of the way, from the racy love scenes to the daily security worries weighing heavy on Cam's shoulders, the reader is aware of the oncoming disasters, even as we root for Blair and Cam to cement their relationship once and for all. <br /> <br />A secondary plot line involving Secret Service agent Paula Stark and FBI agent, Renee Savard, is interwoven into the story. Renee is still recovering from wounds suffered during a previous attempt on Blair's life, and Paula continues to be part of Cam's team protecting the president's daughter. Their relationship unfolds sweetly and delightfully, and Paula plays a critical role in the exciting events that unfold. <br /> <br />As usual with Radclyffe's books, the sex scenes are hot, the twists and turns of the plot are engrossing, and theaction scenes build slowly and explode effectively. Best of all, at the end of this fourth book in the series, the reader is left wanting more, and there is definitely room for another novel. Highly recommended. ~Lori L.

Each evening for the past two weeks, it has been my great joy to end the day by reading a chapter or two of John Dufresne's sensible, sensitive, and sometimes funny book. Dufresne, a novelist and college teacher, has written a wonderful volume about writing well. I went through two containers of Post-It flags in order to mark the wise and witty spots that I want to reflect upon further for my own writing and use in teaching my classes.    But this book is not necessarily a book for teachers. It's a guide for writing fiction that writers at all levels would benefit by reading. Dufresne has split the book into two major sections: The Process and The Product, with a follow-up section containing advice about reading and craft, and a bibliography as well. Using common sense and a breadth of knowledge about the life and writing of authors throughout the ages, the author gives solid advice and often laugh-out-loud observations. Each section provides wonderful exercises--some of the best ideas for prompting writing that I have ever encountered.     Dufresne approaches fiction--the \\"lies\\" we write that tell the truth--by focusing on the importance of the story and of the characters who people our stories. He tells us we \\"crave a person's story. You want meaning, but not answers. Fiction writers understand that there are no answers, simple or otherwise. The point is not to answer, but to question, not to solve, but to seek, not to preach, but to explore, not to assure, but to agitate\\" (p. 61). In the Introduction, when Dufresne says, \\"Well the _idea_ of writing is overwhelming; the act of writing, however, is simplicity itself,\\" he is right on. And everything he tells us throughout the rest of the book is aimed toward encouraging each writer to get past being overwhelmed to focus on the act of writing.    I loved this book! It is one to which I will return again and again, both as a writer and as a teacher. John Dufresne does a marvelous job making the process and experienceof writing understandable. His sage take on things and his witty, educated style make this volume a joy to read. Whether you are already an author or are contemplating writing, this lively, clever, and entertaining book will speak to you. This one gets my highest recommendation. ~Lori L. Lake, (...)	2004-10-15

In this third novel in the Marshall \\"Mars\\" Bahr series, author K.J. Erickson has delivered a terrific plot, engaging characters, and a nail-biter finish that comes out of left field. Mars is in his final days as the lead detective assigned to a special unit created by the previous police chief. Because of a regime change in the department, Mars and his intelligent assistant Nettie are happy to be moving to the Cold Case Unit at the State's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. But one last murder intervenes.     The wife of flashy basketball star, Tayron \\"T-Jack\\" Jackman has been viciously murdered in her home. Mars intuitively knows that Jackman must be responsible for Terri DuCain Jackman's death. He very quickly learns that T-Jack  was obsessively controlling and brutal toward his wife, beating her regularly. Unfortunately, at the time of the murder, the cocky ball player was with Terri's wealthy parents wrapping up a one hundred million dollar deal in which he would divorce Terri and walk away. Not only does he get the hundred mil, but upon his wife's death, he also gets the five-year-old daughter whom he doesn't ever plan to let Terri's stricken parents see.    Everyone involved in the investigation believes Jackman arranged to kill his wife, but proving it is another matter. It doesn't help that the new chief of police is a nincompoop or that Mars is soon struggling with departmental politics of the worse kind. Dead bodies start surfacing, and simultaneously, issues with Mars' ex-wife and son, Chris, crop up and cause a very harried Mars to sweat the impending deadline to close the case.     With Erickson's dynamite cast of characters and an engrossing plot that won't quit, this book is a real page-turner. Erickson has herself a wonderful new franchise that could go on a long time in much the same way that John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series has. (...)	2004-08-28

With her lover, Lilian, out of town at an important poetry slam, Carline has no one to help her deal with this new indignity, and she finds herself falling into an emotional whirlpool from which she doesn't know how to escape.  <br /> <br />Carline is a woman of size - in other words, she is extremely fat. \\"Fat. It always came back to that... Vicious comments on the street, carefully worded references to `professional appearance' in job reviews, suddenly masked looks on the faces of friends; at this moment, hatred was all I could see, all I could breathe, all I was\\" (p. 20). A crisis looms over her life. <br /> <br />Carline works as an administrator in a home economics program and specializes in pamphlets that help homemakers. Despite distributing information and assistance to women on five continents, Carline is dismayed that so few people pay attention to the details that are critically important to her. She is thwarted because \\"(p)eople who thought home economics was just pie crusts and vacuuming occupied every station in life; they outnumbered, perhaps, those who believed home economics no longer existed\\" (p. 15). In her own little home economics world, Carline has barely let into her consciousness the fact that her job doesn't seem meaningful, nor does much of her life. It is as if she has let her extra weight insulate her from true feeling, preventing any awareness to permeate and spur her toward needed change. <br /> <br />So when Carline is accosted by the young toughs and her fragile sense of self is knocked completely askew, she stews for a day. Then her aunt Frankie from Chalk, Texas calls to report the death of a dear friend. Carline quits her job, packs a bag, and takes off on a bus trip with two odd fellows, Mel, who usually rides the bus with her, and Tucker, the driver, who is taking the old bus across the country to Dallas where it can be auctioned.  <br /> <br />The trip Carline takes is both internal and external, and little of it went at all like I expected. I don't want to ruin the surprises of the story, but suffice to say that there are several unexpected turns, each of which causes Carline to come closer and closer to confronting her own fears and pain and anguish. It takes her a long time to come to grips with the fact that she has \\"kept going under, shaking myself out of it, then falling again into fear and self-hate. The worse part was that it seemed so ordinary. I needed to stop\\" (p. 179). The tale of this journey \\"to stop\\" is filled with good writing, gold nuggets of description, and insightful narrative. The author has offered up a real jewel of a novel, featuring a character at times awkward, at times selfish, but ultimately compelling and sympathetic as she moves forward in her quest for understanding.  <br /> <br />Stinson's previous novel, FAT GIRL DANCES WITH ROCKS, focused on a 17-year-old fat teen and her struggles with societal meanness about fat women and girls; VENUS OF CHALK takes on some of the same issues and expands upon them by showing a woman, several years older, dealing with the similar pain, misunderstanding, and self-loathing. The journey Carline takes, dealing with awkward relationships, past pain, and internalized homophobia (and fat-phobia as well), makes for an engrossing read. Do not miss this one. It's one of the best books of the year. ~Lori L.

Some time ago, I purchased a set of 48 playing-card-sized cards painted by Susan Seddon Boulet. I've kept them by my computer and occasionally dip into the deck, pull one out, and see if the colorful painting in some way inspires me in my writing. Now, with his new \\"A Little Every Day Decks,\\" creativity coach, writer, and psychologist Eric Maisel has given me an exciting new deck and a simple, easy-to-use program to spur creativity and inspiration. Each card contains a truth about creativity: \\"Grow creative by astonishing yourself\\" or \\"Grow creative by opening to serendipity,\\" for instance. The point of focus on each card is book-ended by ideas about the truth and then an exercise that can be done to enhance or change one's experience and accessing of creativity. <br /> <br />In an introductory section, Maisel tells us, \\"You can read through the thirty cards in your deck, pick out the one that feels particularly resonant, and try the simple exercise the card suggests. You can use the cards as a thirty-day program, taking in one message a day....You can shuffle the cards, cut the deck and let a random (is it really random?) message speak directly to you.\\" All of these are good ideas, and once you've gone through the deck, I have a hunch it will pay off to go through it again. And again. <br /> <br />I've been examining and pondering the meanings of the cards for a couple weeks now and have settled upon using one each day at random before I begin my writing. In just a little over two weeks, I find that each morning I am anticipating reading the next card. Often the idea contained within stays with me all day, firing me on to carry out my appointed tasks. The cards are not just for writers or artists but for anyone seeking to expand, explore, or open up channels of creativity. Highly recommended. ~Lori L.

In the middle of the 9th century, a young girl lives in the royal castle in medieval Europe with her mother, the queen, and her dastardly father, Markold. The throne must pass through Queen Ingunn of Roderick's bloodline. Because she has had no sons, her only child, Ragny, is the last descendant of the line. \\"Queen Ingunn had made a mistake, and paid for it all her life, but now, with her life gone, she saw a way to make amends\\" (p. 1). The queen lies on her deathbed. Her last wish in order to make amends is to see her estranged daughter-and to proclaim Ragny rightful heir to the throne as the new queen of Spain. Unfortunately, it is not to be for Markold holds sway over the soldiers and servants of the household. Though Markold does not keep Ingunn from giving Ragny a key piece of information, before the queen dies, he does prevent the proclamation of a new queen. Instead, he intends to marry Ragny, his daughter, and force her to bear a son of the Roderick line. <br /> <br />Ragny is young, slender, almost boyish. She hasn't fully bloomed to womanhood, and already she is facing dilemmas of the worst kind. She cannot stay with Markold and claim her rightful place and to flee is a risky proposition, but she chooses the latter course. With the king's men hot on her trail, she begins a journey to Francia disguised as a young man named Roderick the Beardless. Little does she realize at first that she has allies her foes cannot even imagine. Despite her youth and inexperience, within Ragny beats the heart of a champion, a lover, and a just person, capable of inspiring others so long as she is attired as a man. What will happen if she drops the disguise? <br /> <br />I read the first few pages of this historical drama/romance in the bookstore, was utterly hooked on this epic tale, and could hardly wait to get home and read more about this warrior princess with strange powers on her side. The twists and turns the story takes kept me reading long into the night. The cast ofcharacters-priests, the French king, the Viking invaders, Frankish knights, and Seffrid, the sergeant charged by Markold to track down Ragny-are all well-drawn as are the battles and conflicts. Ragny's journey, both external and internal, was illuminated with grace and power by an author clearly comfortable with bringing history to life. I loved this book! I'd have paid a lot closer attention to medieval history in college if it had been this mesmerizing. Highly recommended to anyone who loves a tale well told about knights and kings, lost princesses, and justice stolen and regained. ~Lori L.

Other authors and experts have covered this topic, but Frank's book is one of the most accessible I have read. Full of common sense suggestions, easy-to-understand explanations, and a cogently organized process, the book is one to which every new writer should turn.  <br /> <br />Drawing on his experience as a high school English teacher, the author walks the aspiring reader through all parts of the writing process. He's structured the book in the form of 10 Commandments (i.e. Thou shalt not Kill Thy Sentences; Thou Shalt Describe Thy World, Express Thy Opinions, and Preserve Thy Past; Thou Shalt Overcome Writer's Block; Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Writer's Prose). Humorously and in an engaging-sometimes laugh-out-loud-style, the author demystifies the writing process and makes it seem fun. Particularly useful are his suggestions for recommended reading and an appendix of the top ten grammar mistakes to avoid. The book is durably composed with no messy slip cover, and it's the perfect size for any novice to carry in a book-bag or purse. <br /> <br />Any new writer serious about exploring the world of writing should get thee to thy nearest book outlet, purchase this book, and read it from cover to cover. The few hours spent will be immensely worthwhile. Highly recommended. ~Lori L.

US	41639692	R2KIZAWTP91ZU9	0743237188	434448992	Fall On Your Knees (Oprah's Book Club)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Outstanding Debut Novel by a Terrifically Talented Writer!	At heart, FALL ON YOUR KNEES is the family saga of Kathleen, Mercedes, Frances, and Lily, the daughters of James and Materia Piper who live in Cape Breton Island off Nova Scotia. But it is so much more-so big and ambitious that it's very much a tour-de-force. This long, detailed novel builds and grows in power and tone, having a cumulative effect, so that by the time you get to the end, you feel you've been walloped with a big stick and fallen into a boggy pond where you are compelled to continue swimming in order to investigate and understand its power.  <br /> <br />The story begins in 1898 with James Piper and doesn't end for some seven-plus decades. In the interim there are enough twists and turns to sink into melodrama, but the story never does that, perhaps because the author has real style which is unique and very different from the narrative techniques used in books nowadays. MacDonald writes from an omniscient viewpoint, going in and out of various consciousnesses, switching perspective and point of view with speed and grace. She breaks every rule I can think of with point of view and she gets away with it with style. I was impressed. It's very 19th century, and that was jarring to me at first, but I quickly became accustomed to the style. The first bit of the book was somewhat choppy, partly because of the narrative style and partly because MacDonald structured this book almost like a mystery. What are the secrets these girls hide? What do their cryptic experiences mean? MacDonald moves about in time, focuses on various characters (some of whom die unexpectedly), and the reader has to keep several character arcs floating all at once even though they come at you in a non-linear fashion. The middle hits a good stride that carries right through to the final pages. Once you get to the last couple of chapters, every little thing falls into place, and you can't help but feel you've been on a major journey!  <br /> <br />The characterization of James, the fatherin the family, is one of the clearest, most sympathetic, and ultimately maddening descriptions of an utter monster of a man that I have ever seen. When I've read about abusive characters in other books-for instance, Daddy Glen in Dorothy Allison's BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA-it was much easier to see the character as a cruel, irredeemable monster for whom I felt no sympathy. James, on the other hand, is rounded out in such a way that although he commits evil, horrible deeds, I saw him as acting out of ignorance, pain, and fear. He seemed believable. He seemed all too real. In other words, I didn't see him as evil through and through. And I saw some level of redemption for him at the end. <br /> <br />About halfway through, MacDonald writes: \\"But memory plays tricks. Memory is another word for story, and nothing is more unreliable\\" (p. 255).  In the same way that no one's memories are absolutely accurate, neither are those of the characters about whom she writes. They misremember, in effect lying to themselves and to others. Failure to correctly recall or failure to remember at all becomes a theme throughout as characters attempt to protect themselves or others from the pain and horrors they've experienced.  <br /> <br />There were other key thematic issues that also struck me: women really got a raw deal in the past; men also got a raw deal, but they were not nearly so constrained as women; war crippled men in ways that weren't observable on the outside; physical and sexual abuse scar not just the victim, but also the perpetrator and everyone else in a family; many habits brought over from the Old Country (and ANY Old Country counts) did not translate well into more modern cultural practices; economic pressures took a serious toll on families, as did war; people close to one another, even when they love one another desperately, can do awful things to one another; and people who lived in the past sometimes had simply horrible lives that came to a bad end for no good reason at all. <br />  <br />MacDonald has a great way with tone and managed to make the book extremely atmospheric-sometimes spooky, sometimes suspenseful, and curiously maddening because she makes the reader wait to get answers to questions one would naturally end up wondering along the way. Her use of language, metaphor, and simile was quite wonderful at times, and it's her steady accretion of images and details that really accentuates the tragedies and events in this complex and fascinating novel. This is one of those books I will probably always remember. It strikes me as exactly the sort of book that should be read in colleges forevermore. It's every bit as good as works by Piercy, Atwood, Tyler, and Morrison. Outstanding debut novel by a talented Canadian writer. ~Lori L.

Many, if not most, mainstream churches have deliberate proscriptions against homosexuality, and with all that we've seen lately in the news, there seems to be no end in sight to the strife. Despite the fact that each year scientists offer more proof that sexual orientation is genetic (i.e. that's the way God made us), many churchgoers and clergy discriminate against gay people. <br /> <br />Lost in the midst of the polemics and condemnations are millions of non-heterosexual people trying to make their way in a world where matters of the Spirit are land mines and the path of that same Spirit does not always appear accessible. In his marvelous new book on this topic, Toby Johnson writes: \\"There is a Sufi saying: 'If the rose knew what the gardener's care would result in come spring, it would joyfully bend to the pruning knife.' Gay people experience pruning in late childhood and early adulthood. We realize the truth of our orientation and have to give up familial and cultural expectations of what our lives will be. Often we experience ridicule and ostracism by schoolmates and peers, along with rejection and disapproval by parents. Even if we grow up feeling it is okay to be gay, we experience confusion and trauma because we will not follow in the path that our parents, teachers, and role models have laid before us\\" (p. 239) It's this very phenomenon that tends to alienate gay people from churches and from the life-force of the Spirit.  <br /> <br />For gay men, in particular, Toby Johnson' book GAY SPIRITUALITY is a lifesaver. Johnson's thesis is that gays are very much \\"Outsiders\\" in American society, and because of that, gay people possess valuable knowledge and inspiration about the true nature of the Spirit. Gay people experience the world differently than others do, including being more aware of the polarities. Ratherthan exclusion from the world of God, religion, and spirituality, Johnson calls for all people to listen to and heed the wisdom gay people have to offer. Because human knowledge and understanding continues to grow, Johnson wants any person struggling with gay issues to know that we are in the middle of a huge transformation of human consciousness-a major paradigm shift. Because of this, there is much to learn and room for growth, all of which is likely to give anyone struggling with issues of the Spirit a fair amount of hope.  <br /> <br />Drawing from world religions, the Hero Cycle, Jungian thought, and dozens of other sources, Johnson discusses religion, spirituality, and sexuality from a variety of angles. With his background as a teacher, theologian, ex-Roman Catholic monk, and writer, this book has much to offer any person exploring spiritual paths. Ultimately, I found myself resonating strongly while reading part of the conclusion: \\"Being gay is a blessing... This discovery is an important part of spiritual maturation. As we understand how blessed we are, we begin to put out good vibes. When we realize that being gay is drawing a long straw in this life, we can forgive the world. We can accept things as they are with all the pain and loss that goes with being human. And when we do that we change the world\\" (p. 259).   <br /> <br />It is clear from this book's premise (and that of the companion volume, GAY PERSPECTIVE: Things Our Homosexuality Tells Us About the Nature of God and the Universe), that Johnson is offer viable and life-changing alternatives for people, both gay and straight, to understand the search for a meaningful spirituality. This is a wonderful book to assist in that search. ~Lori L. Lake, reviewer for The Independent Gay Writer and Midwest Book Review <br />	2004-07-29

Having already read a dozen of his books, I came to this new volume with excitement. I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />Several authors and experts have covered the topic of writing book proposals, but none have done it in the organic, yet sensible, way Maisel does. Drawing on his experience as both author and creativity coach, he walks the reader through all parts of the process, including shaping the idea, titling the book, creating all aspects of the proposal, and understanding the agent and publisher's expectations. Particularly useful are his checklists and suggested formats for keeping track of project and proposal. <br /> <br />Any writer serious about creating a work of non-fiction should run-don't walk!-to your nearest book outlet, get this book, and read it from cover to cover. The few hours spent will be immensely worthwhile not just for writing the proposal, but also for devising the general (perhaps even specific) outline to follow in the actual writing of the book. <br /> <br />Maisel includes a tremendously helpful Appendix: a sample book proposal for what turned out to be his previous book, THE VAN GOGH BLUES, which is a mind-blowingly wonderful book. With his focus on helping authors succeed and to access their creativity in the most profitable and satisfactory ways, Maisel has made this a book no writer should miss. ~Lori L.

And so begins a journey in the present as well as in the past. <br /> <br />Rose's first person tale is bookended by events in the present, while the bulk of the novel tells the story of her youth. In a crisp, fresh, and often funny voice, she tells of her early struggles with her manic-depressive mother, of feeling alone and outside the pale during her school years, and most of all, of her friendship with Jessie who not only had a screwed up mother similar to Rose's, but also carried hidden wounds of traumatic abuse.  <br /> <br />Much of Rose's description of her childhood is moving, and with her fine prose, Esposito never lapses into melodrama. \\"I was nine the first time my mother got sick, leaving me with an emptiness that clawed at me like some little trapped animal. It was as if some faceless man had taken her away in the middle of the night and because I could not yet feel where she ended and I began, had taken me with them. I awoke one morning to find her shell and a hugeness that grew louder and louder and more panicky inside me. The first aloneness\\" (p. 34).  <br /> <br />The way Rose attempts to make sense of her world, to grow up, to find a place for herself is by terms touching and comical. I laughed out loud when Rose describes her friend's enormous Newfoundland dog: \\"She was, I was sure, some mix of black bear and water buffalo, definitely bigger and heavier than me, with long black fur and a mouth I envisioned snapping off my leg in one jagged bloody chomp\\" (p. 22).  <br /> <br />Esposito has a delightful sense of timing as well as the ability to evoke character, particularly Rose's, in ways that kept me glued to the book. For instance, at her grandmother's funeral, she nervously connects back up with childhood friend Jessie, and thinks this: \\"I can't even tell you why I'm so damn nervous except that I don't know where to start. You can't start from where you left off because that was a dozen years ago and you end up feeling like William Randolph Hearst clutching a sled, rocking back and forth in some dark room, whispering, 'Rosebud, Rosebud'\\" (p. 116). Esposito's ability to juxtapose flashes of comedy into the story is illuminating in the way that unexpected lightning allows for brief glimpses into dark places.  <br /> <br />By the time the events of the past catch up with the quandaries and disasters of the present, it's clear that Rose has the ability to rise above her circumstances-but will she make the right choices in order to do so? She has the possibility of a life with Jessie, but can she let go of her hang-ups and really communicate with the people she loves? \\"Love is knowing a person's tender spots, the places where the skin is transparent, not fully formed, like the clear membrane that holds a yolk round even after you separate it from the white. Love is standing guard over a beloved's yolk\\" (p. 219). Musings like that are just lovely and endeared Rose to me forever. How she gets to the point where she can stand over someone else's yolk, much less her own, makes for a wonderful story. This is a book that shouldn't be missed. ~Lori L.

He?s had an affair with a Major in the British Army and been found out. From the unexpected violence of the opening pages to his journey?first in Lower Canada, then Pennsylvania and onward as he travels West?it is clear that Chapman is an innocent. He has no frontier skills, no horse, no weapons, and some serious doubts about his courage, most of which were implanted by his abusive father. But he does have determination to try to make it to free land in the West to stake his claim or die trying. If he can make it to the Warren Outpost and get free supplies and a parcel of his own land, he thinks his troubles will be over. <br /> <br />Despite the snow and ice, he manages to cross the Allegheny Plateau, but is lost, physically spent, and out of food. Days?perhaps hours?from death, he comes upon a cabin in the wilderness where he is reluctantly taken in by the threatening and mysterious Daniel McQuay.  <br /> <br />From this point on, the characters he meets (Daniel, George Chase in Franklin, the solitary Indian woman Gwennie, and the charmingly handsome Palmer Baxter) all have a huge impact on his life. Over the long winter, Daniel teaches him survival skills, but he wants something and eventually scares Chapman away. George Chase then lets him stay in a vacant cabin, but he wants something. Chapman doesn?t know what Gwennie wants. It?s clear Palmer wants Chapman, but our hero isn?t about to succumb to the kind of love and attraction that has already gotten him in trouble and cost a man his life. Despite the fact that Chapman manages to resist Palmer?s charms initially, he still has to deal with small-mindedness, sexism, racism, the ignorant swath of compassionless ?Christians,? bad weather, and new enemies. And old enemies. Lurking in the midst of Chapman?s seemingly safe world is an evil enemy who has the capacity to turn his world upside down and who,of course, does just that. Injuries, deaths, and intrigue ensue, and I was at the proverbial edge of my seat through most of the last half of the book. <br /> <br />The tale is wonderfully told. Jensen?s dialogue is fresh and realistic, giving an accurate flavor of late 18th century while not overwhelming the reader with colloquialisms. Chapman has a sense of humor, especially about his failure to be a tough, he-man type.  He displays a gentleness and humanity many of the settlers lack that made me identify with and love him. His narrative of the weather and environment is balanced perfectly as in this lovely description: ?Lightning flashed against the darkening sky, giving me an excuse to turn away. Already dark clouds the color of ugly bruises and hateful intentions were closer, bearing down on us as surely as winter on autumn. Occasional gusts of wind rumbled own the valley rippling through the treetops, their leaves trembling suddenly in the sunlight like a million green-winged birds in flight? (p. 263).  <br /> <br />Jensen has crafted a compelling story the likes of which I have never read before. I am not aware of any historical drama/adventure/romance based upon such a well-rounded and mesmerizing gay character. John Chapman?s first person account is riveting. This is bildungsroman of the highest order, a story of love, lust, greed, and striving set against the unforgiving American frontier. I can?t recommend it highly enough! ~Lori L.

She just isn't entirely sure how to go about it.<br />Though only 26, Terry has already been through a lot in her life. Through her own drunken rage, she lost the love of her life. She's got issues with her family, some of which are because she's lesbian, but also because she was such a wild girl, and her connections with her brothers and parents have been affected by all the lies and failures. She flunked out of school, ran with a fast crowd, and did a lot of risky things. She knows the addiction to drugs and alcohol is terrible for her health and well-being, but she for a long time she kids herself whenever her shortcomings become apparent to others or to her. \\"These insinuations about my ego just chap my ass,\\" (p. 31) she says early on. This first-person narrator has got a comic voice at times, and the story she tells is, by turns, very funny and very heartbreaking. <br />It takes a long time and quite a number of mistakes before Terry starts to get her head on straight. For anyone who has ever been addicted, particularly to alcohol, or been around others struggling with the nightmare of drunkenness, every angle of her story rings true. When Terry finally admits that she \\"cannot take the pain of knowing that I can't trust myself, of knowing the rage and insanity that lurk within me,waiting for the next drink,\\" (p. 122), a glimmer of hope can be found. She still has to hit bottom, learn to connect with others while not high, and figure out how to fashion a life worth living, but with that admission, she is starting to change. <br />Bufford opens each chapter with a quotation from the 12-Step world, and that's where the title of the book came from: \\"If there's a minus (step) one, that's where I'm at.\\" But don't mistake this book to be about recovery only. It's a coming-of-age story, a love story, and an entertaining and engrossing journey through one woman's life. I couldn't put the book down and read it in one sitting. I highly recommend it. ~Lori L.

Quinn looks around, can't find an attending physician, and immediately takes over the victim's care with the help of a nurse and the woman who first greeted her whom she assumes is a resident. Big mistake. Instead, it's Honor Blake, the chief of emergency services. Fortunately, Honor doesn't hold Quinn's assumptions against her. While both women are secretly impressed with the skills the other displayed in saving the patient's life, they're also wary of the other. <br />So begins an uneasy alliance during which circumstances draw Honor and Quinn together, and they find themselves unaccountably attracted to one another. Honor can't figure out why a surgeon as skilled as Quinn chose to leave a prominent position at a big-time New York hospital to be an attending ER doctor at a university hospital in Philly. And Quinn can't figure out why Honor shies away from her when it's clear there's an undeniable pull between them. Both of them have secrets they refuse to divulge. How can they work together, much less become friends-or more-so long as each is so carefully guarding her own little world?<br />The story of these two women's lives-and the twists and turns that take place to bring them to the same place-is impossible to put down. With ample angst, realistic and exciting medical emergencies, winsome secondary characters, and a sprinkling of humor, FATED LOVE turns out to be a terrific romance. It's one of the best I have read in the last three years. Run-do not walk-right out and get this one. You'll be hooked by yet another of Radclyffe's wonderful stories. Highly recommended. ~Lori L.

The rage of her husband has gradually escalated over the years, and \\"four days after the fist and the blood,\\" she flees to Brooklyn. Fortunately she has a decent job which allows her to move into a small place of her own, and she begins the process of trying to come to terms with her past, deal with the issues of the present, and forge a future. <br />The early chapters of the book are gripping, and the descriptions of her separation, grief, and adjustment are, at times, intense. For the first time in ages, she is alone, and the process of reconciling herself to that will be familiar to anyone going through a breakup. She wants to know if she can make it on her own. She needs to know why her husband did what he did to her. She wonders if she is gay. \\"I had spent 27 years making sure everything fit into a nice little suburban box. I was finding it hard that I didn't fit into the box so easily any more. I kept looking for a \\"for sure\\" test. You know, spin around three times, clap your hands and if you start humming the Indigo Girls, then proof positive. Hand that girl a rainbow sticker and tell her to get her hair cut already\\" (p. 28). <br />The first signs of a sense of humor emerge early on. We follow the narrator along through random days at work, her encounters with oddball people, and into episodic scenes where she reflects on and attempts to make a new life for herself. At times, the story is a bit rambling and picaresque. The occasional bit of humor keeps the narrative rolling. For instance, her cat, Maggie, is actually male. \\"Friends told me I was the only person they knew with a Jewish transgender cat.\\" Another instance: she puts a personals ad in Match.com. \\"I had no idea what that meant or what it was I thought I'd find there. I just generally believed in the power of the Internet to fix my life\\" (p. 70). The sardonic wit is welcome, especially since it's often unexpected.<br />But in between the funny observations and the grief-struck memories, the structure of the novel doesn't quite hold. The book reads a great deal more like an autobiography or memoir, so it's curious that the author chose to specifically label it \\"A Novel,\\" as though otherwise the reader wouldn't know. As the unnamed narrator moves forward in her healing process and begins dating women and exploring her sexual orientation, the narrative punch decreases. Some of that is because we never really get to know anyone she encounters, and we never even know her name. People come and go, but there's little solidity to hang on to...still, we want good things for the narrator. By the end of the book, she's had an interesting journey, sometimes rambling, sometimes odd, but interesting all the same. ~Lori L.

After eight years of experience with community organizing and activism on behalf of LGBT families, Abigail Garner has written a book about kids with gay parents. FAMILIES LIKE MINE is full of heart and hope-but even more importantly, it's full of truths. Because of her own experience as a child with two gay dads, she speaks from a well-qualified vantage point. She says she is \\"culturally queer\\" but heterosexual, and with that perspective, she comes at the topic from a unique and fascinating angle.<br />Using extensive research and interviews with some five dozen youths, Garner discusses many topics including: adult parents coming out in the family; family changes, particularly divorces and same-sex break-ups; how kids with LGBT parents handle school; the concept of \\"straight family privilege\\"; the impact of HIV/AIDS; straight kids in queer culture; and kids of LGBT parents who don't grow up to be straight. She doesn't shy away from tough questions, and she doesn't believe that kids with gay parents grow up exactly like everyone else. But it is clear that she is championing a little-heard truth: that kids with LGBT parents don't reach adulthood any more wounded or messed up than other kids from straight homes. In fact, many such children grow up more open-minded and tolerant than their peers, though they often have to face a great deal more antagonism and prejudice than is fair.<br />Weaving into the book her own fears and experiences, Garner is able to clearly delineate many of the problems that members of a non-traditional family encounter. For instance, once when her biological father was out of town, Garner's other dad, Russ, fell ill and was rushed to the ER. Most of us take for granted that as legal members of the immediate family, we'd get to visit our parent in the hospital and would be entitled to medical information. Garner was lucky because no one asked questions when she claimed to be Russ's daughter. But under the rules of most hospitals, if she had beenchallenged, she could have been barred from his room. She is correct when she writes, \\"What are labeled as special rights are not special at all; they are human rights that are currently being denied to LGBT citizens\\" (p. 127). A right as simple as visiting a sick member of the family ought not be denied, but it does happen.<br />I found this book to be tremendously readable and could not put it down. The contributions from the interviewees and the author's personal story were fascinating. Garner's ability to synthesize and explore this topic in such an accessible way is ground-breaking. By the end, when Garner writes, \\"Children of LGBT parents, however, are thriving in this world of possibilities\\" (p. 228), I found myself hoping that this would continue to be true and that our society would become more accepting, more knowledgeable, and with many more resources for \\"alternative\\" families. <br />This is a book that belongs in all libraries and should be read by school administrators, teachers, social workers, legislators, and parents (whether they are gay or not). If people would listen to Garner's message, the world would be a better place for all kids, whether their parents are gay or straight.  ~Lori L.

Marcia Muller, a pioneer in the field of writing women sleuths, talks about developing a series character while Ellen Hart covers sidekicks and supporting characters. Essays on writing villains, atmosphere/suspense, place, setting, character creation and development, research, plotting, style, pacing, and ending the mystery fill out the book.<br />One of my favorite essays is Joan M. Drury's \\"The Wrong Way: My Approach to Plot, Process, and Endings\\" in which she describes the organic methods she employs to create her stories. Instead of adhering to a strict outline and knowing in advance exactly where her plot is going, she lets it take her whither it will. This is a particularly useful essay for a new writer because most first-time authors are, indeed, making it up as they go.<br />The voices of each author are clear, sincere, and helpful. Reading this book was like getting an audience with a panel of experts who had already walked the path I am treading. Whether you are a new writer or an experienced author, this collection will be useful and entertaining. Highly recommended.	2004-04-30

At long last, this sequel resolves the cliffhanger we were left with at the end of the fourth installment of this immensely entertaining sci-fi/fantasy series. When last we saw Isis's leader Tomyris \\"Whit\\" Whitaker, her jet and that of fellow soldier Danu Sullivan had been chased by enemy forces into Elysium territory. In this continuation of the WINGED ISIS storyline, Whit and Danu crash land and are faced with the difficulties of hiding and surviving in enemy lands. By a stroke of good luck, they fall in with a group of Amazon rebels. But the enemy is hot on their trail, and they are outnumbered hundreds to one.<br />The women of Isis live in Freeland, a democratic city-colony on the western side of the U.S. On the other side is Elysium where religious fanatics, corrupt men, and the Regulators, a Gestapo-type of police force live violent, miserable lives.  The highly technological and deadly Elysium men want nothing more than to destroy Isis and take their resources, and only the Border shield powered by satellites stops them. Unfortunately, the Border has developed inconsistencies, and that's how the enemy got in. Though the Freeland forces did repel the Elysium attackers, they can't afford to lose Whit or Danu, and a rescue mission must be planned. Unfortunately, as with most Isis emergencies, the plan is not quickly decided upon, and Whit's partner Kali and Danu's girlfriend Tor are tortured by the wait. When the two women take off prematurely on a journey to rescue the two fighters, they set in motion a series of events resulting in battles, chases, and the death of a key character. <br />Stewart's plotting is deft and focused, her characters well-rounded, and the storyline compelling. Nobody writes lesbian adventure fiction like she does. I have said it before that Stewart's work in its own special category: a hybrid of science fiction, adventure, and romance in a uniquely lesbian framework. WIZARD OF ISIS has an exhilarating pace and engrossing plotline. I couldn't put the book down until I came to the end, and I eagerly await the next installment. ~Lori L.

Little does she know that she will become an overnight sensation when disaster strikes at the state capitol, and she happens to be the only news person on the scene to relay the news live, on camera. She also helps with the rescue efforts, and her live report is carried nationally. Being thrust into the limelight has a dual positive effect: she is accorded fame, and the adoring focus brings her into contact with journalist Jay Parker, who happens to be an acquaintance from Kate's college days. <br />Jay and Kate's lives have touched before-twice, actually, under appalling circumstances. But the third time's a charm, and this time around there is no stopping the attraction. They embark upon a love affair with more passion and intensity than either of them has ever felt before. But once again, disaster strikes, and this time it's entirely out of their control. Will the price of fame mean that these two will be crushed? <br />This is romance writing at its most absorbing, with all the angst and uncertainty of missed communications and misdirected intentions. Ames touches on many aspects of these two women's lives, past and present, and though the reader can't help but root for their relationship, there is no way on earth it can work for them...or could it?

He keeps a low profile because he doesn't want to be treated like the school outcast and scapegoat Brian Bund upon whom all manner of dirty tricks and teenage cruelties are visited. Instead, Russel spends his time with Gunnar and Min, a guy and girl known for their brains, but who are also \\"occasional visitors to the border region of high school respectability\\" (p. 6).  Russel is not eager to leave that border. Ever.<br />By a fluke Russel learns that another student is also gay, and he embarks upon that universally heady, intense journey where falling in love seems oh-so-right. He joins the baseball team to be with his boyfriend-even hits a home run-and suddenly he's living in the Land of the Popular. But he also meets some other kids who are gay and lonely. They have an inspiration to start a gay/lesbian support group, but in order to keep out those who would mock and exile them, they call it Geography Club. Unfortunately, the secret does not stay confidential, and the fallout is more than Russel thinks he can bear. Will he choose to take the coward's way out? Or can he stand up to the ignorant people all around?<br />With a light touch and a sense of humor, Hartinger tells a very serious story, one that is being played out in high schools across the country. With unerring accuracy, he depicts the isolation and fear first of one young man, then of a small group, and he reveals the courage and support it takes for any gay or lesbian high school student to stand up to the crowd. By the end of this novel, I had tears in my eyes. The story is moving, the characters are classic, and the discoveries Russel makes are ones that both high schoolers and adults should all learn. Highly recommended.	2004-04-30

The circumstances of that prologue don't connect up for some time, but the shadow of the kidnapping hangs over the events that follow. In the present day, Jane Lawless is called to the location of a wedding her staff is catering. The guests are behaving oddly, and it quickly becomes clear that they've been poisoned with something hallucinogenic. The police come, and the wedding guests are rushed to the hospital, but not before the Nick, the bridegroom, is badly injured diving into an empty swimming pool. Jane is frantic. Not only is she upset that people have been injured after eating her catered food, but she also fears lawsuits. Who would do such a terrible thing? She can't believe her workers would have anything to do with it. Why has she been targeted?<br />Alden Clifford, the groom's father, is a high school teacher, and he comes to the forefront as it becomes apparent that the attack might be connected to him and not about Jane at all. Six months earlier he had tried to prevent a school shooting, and the boy with the gun eventually shot and killed himself. Allegations about Alden's relationship with the boy come out, and Jane begins to wonder if this has made Alden the intended target. Nothing is immediately resolved, and Jane and The Lyme House are under police investigation. Jane turns to her best friend, Cordelia, but Cordelia has her own problems: namely a toddler dumped upon her doorstep by her sister. The little niece and Cordelia offer some great comic moments, and Cordelia, all by herself, is always funny. She refuses to ride in Jane's new Mini Cooper, calling it the \\"Daisy Duck-mobile.\\" Instead she has bought herself a green Hummer, a useful purchase which becomes clear later in the novel.<br />With an intricately interwoven plot, Hart rolls out perfectly timed scenes and details. The tension buildsas the injury and death count increases. The author has never been better and does a marvelous job weaving in a compelling back story with the events of the present. She draws the reader in to this complex structure and doesn't let go until the final denouement some three hundred pages later. It's a gripping and compelling story. By the time the reader reaches the end, an intimate ghost has truly made its haunting presence known. (...)	2004-04-01

She's had problems everywhere she's gone and been basically labeled incorrigible. One more screw-up, and she'll be sent to a prison-like facility until she turns 18. Against her better judgment, Lucy connects right away with Leon, one of the counselors who she finds out later has had his own painful foster care past. When he tells her early on that there is \\"hardly anything in Kindle Home that isn't broken somehow,\\" it resonates with the reader. Lucy later says that the home is nothing more than \\"a storage shed for broken teenagers,\\" and she isn't too far off. Lucy and her fellow residents have major problems, many of which have to do with having been deprived of love early on.<br />Though only in her mid-teens, Lucy is worn out and on the brink of giving up. She is tired of fighting the other kids; tired of uncaring counselors; most of all, tired of being uprooted continually. So she decides to make an effort to stay at Kindle Home, but right away she finds herself facing obstacles, not the least of which is her own temper. And then things get even more complicated when she gets in a fight at school, one of the fellow residents has it out for her, someone's setting fires in the neighborhood, and the funding for the home is being threatened. Can Lucy pull things together and face up to all the issues that are coming down upon her?<br />In this second novel, following his critically acclaimed GEOGRAPHY CLUB, Hartinger has done a marvelous job of bringing Lucy, the counselors, and the kids to life. He's written the story in first-person point of view, and Lucy's voice is clear and refreshing. You can hear and see her grow throughout the events of the story. From Lucy's first line, \\"The door was locked, and I sure as hell didn't have the key,\\" until the end of the story whenLucy has managed to find and fully possess all the keys she needs to succeed, I was charmed and moved. THE LAST CHANCE TEXACO is a terrific book geared toward the Young Adult market, but also worthwhile for adults to read, if only to see and understand the world that kids like Lucy Pitt are forced to survive in.

Its been since 1996 that Marie Sheppard Williams published her debut collection, THE WORLDWIDE CHURCH OF THE HANDICAPPED, and those were seven long years. At last, her new book of short stories has arrived, and it was well worth the wait. The five semi-autobiographical storiesnearly novellasthat comprise the book take on all sorts of topics: the inability of families to truly understand one another, Alzheimers, the death of a cousin and all its repercussions even decades later, the fickleness of friendship, as well as the meanness, heroism, and the generosity of ordinary, everyday people. <br />Joan, the first-person narrator of all five stories, sees the world with an unusual clarity and precision, and she shares her viewpoint honestly, even when she thinks less of herself. She writes about the relationship she has with Sara, an elderly Alzheimers patient for whom she is a paid companion, and says The time I spend with Sara is boring. I nearly expire of boredom... Later, when Sara calls Joan sweet, Joan writes, Can you imagine? I am about as sweet as strychnine. If Sara could see the inside of me sometimes, she would flinch in terror (p. 170). Then Joan goes on to explain all the reasons why she is not sweet, and its very funny. She puts into words all the frustrations anyone would feel working with an Alzheimers patient, and the reader cant help but think, There but for the grace of God go Iand if that ever happens to me, I hope my caretaker is someone like Joan.<br />Williams treatment and descriptions of the elderly, the odd, the young, and the inexplicable border on comedic much of the time, but then she turns everything on its head and manages to confront the mysteries of life and death with compassion and wisdom. How is it that with such deceptively simple language and chatty delivery, we suddenly find ourselves wrapped up in all sorts of questions about the mystery of the past, the present, and the future? Im not sure how she does it, but she manages to move between the nutty and the sublime with surprising ease. These lines gave me the shivers:  How do we live from day to day? Whywe live by Gods courtesy, in the shadow, or in the light, of our own deaths (p. 168), and upon reading this, we believe Joan knows it as an incontrovertible fact. <br />I have never read any other author who writes with exactly this sort of style and grace. Author Bill Holm calls Williams a descendant of Sherwood Anderson, but I tend to disagree. She possesses wholly and completely her own special and unique Voice, and it will not be denied. Read these stories to be entertained, to laugh, and to puzzle over peoples bizarre quirks, but above all, for the shivers of recognition about the depth, the danger, and the meaning of life. ~Lori L.

At first the cops don't even suspect that the death is a homicide, and the story builds steam gradually as Mars and Nettie come to understand that the cryptic numbers inked on the dead man's arm match those of other seemingly unrelated victims, all of whom had ancestors connected to the Battle at Gettysburg. It becomes a race against the clock for a team of computer techs to match data to try to prevent further murders. <br />I enjoyed this second installment in a very promising series.

Then Ash receives legal papers from her long-lost father concerning the estate of her grandmother, and long buried family secrets begin to emerge. To top things off, she unexpectedly uncovers evidence of corporate ethics violations, which could put her in danger. Whom can she trust? Which secrets from the past will come out, and what about the powerful pull she feels toward Renee?<br />With deft characterizations, an engrossing plot, and a marvelous sense about the volatility of secrets, Cameron Abbott has crafted an terrific follow-up to her first novel, To The Edge.

I am thankful I chose to read GAY PERSPECTIVE. This is a book full of hope and heart, and every person-gay or straight-would benefit from reading it. Toby Johnson, the author of the previous groundbreaking book, GAY SPIRITUALITY, takes his points from that earlier book one step further and delineates a careful examination of all the ways that an \\"outsider\\" perspective - such as a non-heterosexual point of view - allows for a unique and life-giving take on true spirituality, as opposed to old-time religion of superstition, fear, and exclusion. He includes chapters on how our homosexuality tells us things about: Life, Sex, Religion, the Church, God, and the World, and in so doing, weaves together a wonderful narrative about all the ways gay people can help society transcend ignorance and embrace true love and compassion.<br />In thoughtful, clear language, Johnson presents positive affirmation that the spiritual consciousness that gay people-indeed, all GLBTQ people-are now expressing is a vital and evolutionary step forward for everyone on the planet. No longer need we be trapped in meaningless, dogmatic, fear-based, or male-dominated religious practices. He writes, \\"It is not a negative, fatalistic, or materialistic secularism our homosexuality reveals to us, but a universe full of mystery, wonder, beauty, and magic\\" (p. 203). We \\"outsiders\\" have the opportunity to rise above that and lead the way for all people to a more loving, accepting, and spiritually fulfilling place.<br />Early on, Johnson says that gay men may find the book to be more about them than lesbians will. He indicates that since he is writing from the experience of a gay man, he doesn't assume to speak for women; however, as a lesbian reading this book, I found that the author accorded respect toward all women and advocated for a holistic and feminist view of relationships for all.  <br />Author, psychotherapist, activist, and community organizer Toby Johnson is also a religious scholar and former Catholic monk. His experience and insight shine in this fantastic new book. I highly recommend it to anyone-gay or otherwise. ~Lori L.

She's gotten so out of hand that neither her mother nor her step-father knows what to do with her. After assaulting a teacher, the juvenile court judge incarcerates Grace until her 18th birthday, which is six months away. Grace is too angry to care. She arrives at Sapling Hill, a kind of boot camp for juveniles, and it doesn't take long for her to realize that the camp instructors don't play by the same rules as the world outside the institution. By yelling, shaming, intimidation, and withholding of privileges, the instructors compel the teen girls to behave, and they suffer consequences when they do not. Surprisingly, Grace responds-in particular, she responds to the tough and relentless Instructor Carey, who sees something in Grace that the kid doesn't even know is there. But Grace's journey isn't going to be an easy one. She is hiding secrets that first must be lanced and healed, and the young woman is in no way prepared to share, not even with Carey for whom she gradually gains a caring and respect. <br />From the first pages, I was hooked. The narrative is fast-paced, the secondary characters are colorful, and the dialogue sparkles. Some of the events at Sapling Hill are quite amusing, and there is plenty of conflict between the teens. It reads like a cross between \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\" and \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" in other words, immensely accessible, seemingly light-but dealing with harsh realities under the surface. Grace's journey is compelling, and Carey's role in it is honorable. The relationships that Grace develops once she drops her guard enough to look around and open up feel truthful and real. <br />Miller and Foster have done an excellent job showing Grace's growth curve from age 17 to 19 or so as she learns to deal with the abuses she has suffered. The romance that eventually grows for her is a fitting end to her struggle. Abook that is a lot of fun to read, this one is highly recommended. ~Lori L.

Jane is still recovering from injuries suffered the previous fall when she was nearly killed, and in this book, she is more vulnerable than she has ever been in any of the previous books. She and her best buddy, Cordelia, travel to upstate Connecticut to an old mansion, Innishannon, to attend the wedding of Cordelia's estranged sister, Octavia, a stage actress who caught the attention of the living legend, Roland Lester. He's an 82-year-old movie director, a millionaire, and a man with multiple secrets including one that goes all the way back to 1957 when his best friend and purported lover, Lew Wallace, was shot in a murder that was never solved. Is this the kind of man Octavia should be marrying? Can Cordelia and Octavia put aside eight years worth of differences and reconcile? And what about the zany cast of characters rattling around at Innishannon?  Roland's brother, a grand-niece, Lew Wallace's son, the housekeeper, and a documentary filmmaker on site all have their own secrets to hide, too. Soon enough, there are more killings, and it is unclear whether they are connected to the past murders or not.<br />I loved the references to the movies. Hart has taken the time to flesh out a mix of made up characters with the real-life stories about Hollywood legends such as Loretta Young, John Wayne, Clark Gable, George Cukor, and many more. Along with that, Cordelia's humor-and even Jane's occasional wry sense of humor-was entertaining. It didn't make for laugh-out-loud yucks, but Cordelia's exaggeration and her sparring with her sister had this reviewer grinning fairly regularly.<br />For readers who have followed the Lawless mysteries since their 1989 inception, Hart continues to build upon the relationships and storylines from the previous nine books, but anyone could pick this novel up, read it out of order, and still be perfectly at home in the world that Hart creates. Highly recommended for all lovers of mystery, and especially for those who enjoy sub-plots of growth and change for the main character along the lines of fiction by Nevada Barr, Carolyn Wheat, Sue Grafton, and Marcia Muller.  ~Lori L.

Within five pages I was intrigued; by page thirty I was hooked. The story begins with a woman-a drug dealer-waiting in her car to make a delivery, but instead, catching sight of a man and young woman getting out of a car and heading toward the bluffs near the Mississippi River. The dealer gets spooked and flees. Then we are introduced to a Minneapolis cop, Marshall \\"Mars\\" Bahr, who is having weekend visitation with his son, Chris (who is one of the most precocious and interesting eight-year-olds in mystery history). By hard work and smarts, Mars has risen to the status of Special Investigator reporting directly to the police chief. He's got an excellent case closure record, and because he is a decent person who treats his colleagues well, he gets fairly good cooperation most of the time. He's also decent to his ex-wife and his son. <br />Mars gets a call about a murder on the bluffs, drops his son off at a Scout meeting, and is launched into the investigation of the death of a high school student from a ritzy part of the Twin Cities. Erickson lays out a wonderfully plotted police procedural with unexpected twists and turns, and not a single one of the characters I suspected turned out to be the murderer. <br />But beyond the mystery angle, Erickson has laid the groundwork for multiple sequels by having a compelling hero in Mars and many promising secondary characters, especially his son and his administrative assistant, Nettie. I've read a lot of debut novels, but this one is superior. The characters are well-drawn, the plot never falters, there are surprises around every corner, and the repartee between Mars and his many contacts is authentic and absorbing. I can't wait to read the sequel. I give this mystery my highest recommendation. ~Lori L.

She and Eric have just purchased a summer retreat in upstate New York, and they are doing so well financially that Jennifer doesn't even need to work. She's living every heterosexual woman's dream. Perhaps the only fly in the ointment is her shrewish mother-in-law and all the expectations of Eric's and her parents. But even they can be ignored when she considers the wondrous layout of the new home and starts thinking of ways to decorate it. The day she and Eric move in, Jennifer becomes acquainted with the next door neighbor, Alex Foster, who is a slightly mysterious novelist with a not-so-mysteriously broken heart. Jennifer, too, has secret aches of her own, and with Eric off at the law office in the city so much, she starts leaning on Alex for companionship, joins her volleyball league, and gets to know Alex's friends. It's only a matter of time before problems bloom for Eric and Jennifer, and the inevitable happens. When it does, the lives of everyone involved threaten to blow apart.<BR> <BR>There aren't any new twists on the straight-woman-falls-in-love-with-a-woman plot, but this story is well-written and contains compelling and believable conflict and angst.

After two years, Reese Conlon and Tory King have cemented their relationship, and they're ready to start a family. Meanwhile, Reese's protg, Brianna Parker, has grown weary of college in New York but is fearful of losing Caroline's love. While Reese and Tory are much more mature and strong, Bri and Caroline are still less sophisticated, which lends a sizable amount of angst to the story when they move apart so Bri can go through police academy and field training in Provincetown with Reese. <BR> <BR>With police work and the medical world as backgrounds, Radclyffe explores the lives of Reese, Tory, and Bri in a leisurely manner, providing a novel full of ups and downs, accidents, illness, misunderstandings, and life-threatening peril. The powerful relationships between family and friends are a major emphasis, and those who enjoy fairly graphic and frequent erotic scenes will not be disappointed. An entertaining read and yet another successful volume to add to the prolific Radclyffe's expanding oeuvre.	2003-12-06

Jewish mother/wife/amateur actress Sheila Katz, married for over thirty years, is stunned from complacency when she learns her daughter Jenny is getting married to a woman named Tamara. Dan, her husband, doesn't take the news well and thinks that given time, Jenny will pass through the phase. He's already suffered enough criticism because his son married a Catholic girl-and converted!-and he refuses to acknowledge his daughter's sexual orientation. This pushes Sheila and Dan's marriage to the edge and contributes to the uproar over Jenny's lifestyle.<br />Sheila is a survivor, though, and she definitely does not want to lose her daughter, so she chooses the \\"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\\" tactic. She starts attending PFLAG meetings, works at readjusting her thinking, and helps to plan the Jewish wedding ceremony behind Dan's back. Little does she know that meeting an attractive lesbian artist will have such an affect her. If her life wasn't turned upside down before, it truly is now. <br />The story of how Sheila and the Katz family deals with this very topical issue is engrossing, endearing, and entertaining, while also sometimes sobering. Schwab uses a smooth and highly readable style to write a novel for the new millennium. With the legalization of marriage in Canada in 2003 and the ongoing social arguments about fair treatment of gays and lesbians, including marriage, this book is timely and fascinating. It's a book all parents-and non-parents-should read. In Schwab's skillful and sensitive hands, A DEPARTURE FROM THE SCRIPT is funny and true to life, but poses no easy answers. Highly recommended. ~Lori L. Lake, book reviewer for Midwest Book Review, The Independent Gay Writer, Just About Write, and TheGayRead.com.	2003-11-06

Starting with a person's first glimmer of an idea about wanting to write, and then carrying on through the whole process of writing, revising, and publishing, See shares her advice and often laugh-out-loud observations. For instance, writing about revising, she says: \\"Revision is when you first get to recognize the distance between what you wanted to write, what you thought were were writing, and what you actually did write. That recognition often makes you want to throw up\\" (p. 177).<br />I loved this book! Carolyn See does a marvelous job describing the pitfalls and peaks of making a literary life while at the same time telling the reader about her own process and experiences-sometimes as guides to follow and other times as cautionary tales. Her sage take on things coupled with a unique voice and style make this book a joy to read. Whether you are already a writer or merely contemplating a literary life, this lively, touching, and entertaining book will speak to you. Highly recommended. ~Lori L.

Vic and Angie, a bus driver and bookie's assistant respectively, have two kids, Joni, 15, and Jake, 14, neither of whom is happy. The story of this family, who live in Edinburgh, Scotland, is told from all four characters' points of view, and Hird captures their voices perfectly. Jake's longings, Joni's petulance and savagery, their mother's alcoholic binges and affair, and their father's resignation to his empty life are all rendered flawlessly.<br />The prose is energetic and cutting; the story, by turns, ugly and bleak. But the novel is also darkly comic, rising up into moments of hilarity. You can't resist laughing while at the same time feeling appalled and uncomfortable by the events and attitudes of the characters.<br />Hird's take on this Scottish family is a frightening look at the characters' failure to connect with one another, to escape their dismal situations, or to even imagine rising above the circumstances they face.  They are alienated, angry, and unable to see any alternative solutions. In that way, there is a universality in the theme Hird is illuminating: that of the desperation and lack of hope some families face and the destruction and misery that follows in their wake. ~Lori L.

In this matrilineal society, the women are the warriors and the men are small, weak, and serve in roles as housekeepers, babysitters, and servants. Tevi does not belong. She is awkward-not good with a sword or any type of weapon-and the leaders of Storenseg do not believe she possesses any useful leadership skills. Her younger sister, Laff, is far better suited for power and ruling.  Unfortunately, Tevi makes the mistake of revealing feelings for a woman, and in this profoundly heterosexist society, that is cause for death or exile. Like the ugly duckling, Tevi is a disgrace in the eyes of all her people.<br />Rather than sentence her own granddaughter to death, the Queen sends Tevi on an impossible mission to recover a chalice stolen under odd circumstances. In anguish, the 19-year-old woman embarks upon a journey to other lands. In classic Quest form, Tevi goes out in the world and this is when the fun starts. While learning new skills and finding talents she didn't know she had, she encounters wayfarers, sorcerers, enchanted castles, witches, wild animals, dwarves, and magic-and Jemeryl, who is a young Sorceress who not only saves Tevi from a terrible fate, but also proves critical  in the search for the stolen chalice. As it turns out, Tevi's quest has much further reaching ramifications than anyone back in Storenseg ever imagined.<br />A mesmerizing read, LORIMAL'S CHALICE is a tour-de-force packed with adventure, ordeals, complex twists and turns, and the internal introspection of appealing characters. The author writes effortlessly, handling the size and scope of the book with ease. Not since the fantasy works of Elizabeth Moon and Lynn Flewelling have I been so thoroughly engrossed in a tale. This is knockout fiction, tantalizingly told, and beautifully packaged. I highly recommend it.	2003-09-04

In other words, Julian Pines, for all its rustic beauty, hard work, and peacefulness is also a place full of excitement and change. \\"(T)he essence of life at Julian Pines...was the blank pageness of it, the way you had to invent life every day and eschew the hierarchical assumption that peace and passion were mutually exclusive\\" (p. 109). At the heart of these beautiful and wonderful stories, it is peace and passion that many of the women struggle to reconcile most--and often with very wry consequences. <br />From a variety of points of view, author Susan Leonardi tells a series of interlocking stories, each of which could probably stand on its own. Taken together, however, they are rich and eloquent and full of surprises. By the end of the book, you feel you know these characters very well. My favorites were Karen, who loves Anne and is the resident priest (despite loud objections from an estranged sister convent and no approval from Rome); Bernadette, whose childhood set her up to be a \\"helper\\" to others, a state of mind from which I was very glad she finally escaped; Beatrice, the abbess, who shares a calm, accepting-and sometimes breathtaking-wisdom in many of her encounters; Donna, a veterinarian who relates better to animals than people and actually \\"sees\\" people as various animal types; Sharon, the school teacher who came for a brief visit, wrote a series of letters to her fiancé and friends extending the visit, then eventually stayed on permanently; Sierra, the youngster who, at the end of the book, reflects back both the goodness and the quirkiness of the place; and lastly, Anne, the writer, who loves everyone and is so filled with passion and life that I wish I knew her in the real world. <br />One of the cleverest chapters (besides the humorous one entitled \\"Anne's List of Sixty-Five Good Reasons for Being a Nun at Julian Pines Abbey and One Bad One\\") has a befuddled Theresa trying to understand the purpose and intent of Anne's fiction writing. Anne has taken the bare bones of one of Theresa's experiences and embellished extravagantly until the story has theme, purpose, and depth-but isn't Theresa's experience anymore. Theresa tells Anne she can't just go and make up things like this, that it's not accurate, that it didn't happen that way, and besides, things have been left out. Anne has a great comeback: \\"(N)ow you're complaining about my sins of omission. A writer has to be able to leave out whatever she wants. Otherwise, we'd still be stuck on our morning pee\\" (p. 50). Leonardi is an author who knows what to include and what to leave out. The prose is lean, but feels lush; the stories spare, but are always enough. <br />AND THEN THEY WERE NUNS turns out to be a most amazing look at the lives of women outside the pale, women who are unusual, but also just like you and me. It is about the way, over time, they manage to weave a life together through all the ups and downs of their unusual existence and how they reconstitute when someone departs, leaving a crack in the community that must be repaired. The language, the cadence of the narratives, the humor, and the brokenness healed make Julian Pines a fictional place I wish I could visit. Highly recommended! ~Lori L. Lake, ...	2003-08-29

In this matrilineal society, the women are the warriors and the men are small, weak, and serve in roles as housekeepers, babysitters, and servants. Tevi does not belong. She is awkward-not good with a sword or any type of weapon-and the leaders of Storenseg do not believe she possesses any useful leadership skills. Her younger sister, Laff, is far better suited for power and ruling.  Unfortunately, Tevi makes the mistake of revealing feelings for a woman, and in this profoundly heterosexist society, that is cause for death or exile. Like the ugly duckling, Tevi is a disgrace in the eyes of all her people.<br />Rather than sentence her own granddaughter to death, the Queen sends Tevi on an impossible mission to recover a chalice stolen under odd circumstances. In anguish, the 19-year-old woman embarks upon a journey to other lands. In classic Quest form, Tevi goes out in the world and this is when the fun starts. While learning new skills and finding talents she didn't know she had, she encounters wayfarers, sorcerers, enchanted castles, witches, wild animals, dwarves, and magic-and Jemeryl, who is a young Sorceress who not only saves Tevi from a terrible fate, but also proves critical  in the search for the stolen chalice. As it turns out, Tevi's quest has much further reaching ramifications than anyone back in Storenseg ever imagined.<br />A mesmerizing read, LORIMAL'S CHALICE is a tour-de-force packed with adventure, ordeals, complex twists and turns, and the internal introspection of appealing characters. The author writes effortlessly, handling the size and scope of the book with ease. Not since the fantasy works of Elizabeth Moon and Lynn Flewelling have I been so thoroughly engrossed in a tale. This is knockout fiction, tantalizingly told, and beautifully packaged. I highly recommend it.<BR>~Lori L. Lake, Reviewer for Midwest Book Review...	2003-08-29

Using compelling examples, she provides a clear and concise overview of the elements of effective mystery and suspense. After giving valuable information about the history of the two related genres, she devotes special attention to each and shows where and how they overlap. In addition to a strong focus upon the structure of the work, she addresses beginnings and middles, the arc of the story, genre formats, and scene and style. She gives special emphasis to effective endings for both suspense novels and mysteries. Wheat covers all the bases and takes it one step further by discussing writing process, the difference between \\"Outliners\\" and \\"Blank Pagers,\\" and what to do when the piece is finished. Her three page summary of \\"The Writing Process: Tools to Help You Finish\\" is worth the price of the book. Also provided is a bibliography of useful books to learn theory, for research, or to find good examples to emulate. HOW TO WRITE KILLER FICTION is an excellent reference and how-to book. All writers who wish to infuse mystery, suspense, or simply a tighter, punchier style to their writing should get this book. ~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-08-29

Darcy gets a late night call from enigmatic police detective Sarah Lindstrom and learns that the cop's ex has been murdered...in Lindstrom's home...in Lindstrom's bed...with a baseball bat. Darcy takes her in for the night. The normally unflappable and distant Lindstrom is stunned and disbelieving. She is a suspect and it's personal, too, so she is not allowed to work with the police on the case. Because of this, she does something totally unexpected and asks Darcy to help investigate the case. <br />The course of the investigation reveals that Lindstrom and Darcy are both in danger, so the grieving cop grudgingly allows Darcy to stay at her house. The combination of stress and anguish makes for a taut and fearful situation for both women as they seek the killer. <br />Meg's wit and longing shine in this installment of the series. It gets bogged down in the relationship angst once or twice in the middle, but very quickly regains steam and takes the reader to a satisfying and slightly unexpected resolution.<BR>~Lori L.

Sonya has three grown kids, but she lost them in a custody battle when they were young, and after all these years, she is ready to be a parent again. The two women meet with two acquaintances, Keith and Aaron, a long-time gay couple, and after a variety of fits and starts and concerns from lawyer Aaron, Keith agrees to help out the two women by being a sperm donor for Janice. After the first try, little Heather, who is the spittin' image of her father, is conceived and born. Janice and Sonya are over the moon with joy.<BR> <BR>Of the four main characters in this book, only Aaron has a good relationship with his family. Janice's mother has no understanding of her daughter's lifestyle, and Sonya and Keith are exiled from their families. This has a major impact on the two couples when tragedy strikes. Suddenly, two of the characters are in a tug-of-war over Heather, and their families, the media, and the legal system are all embroiled in it, too.<BR> <BR>I liked the fact that both gays and lesbians were given equal time in this book, and I was delighted to see how Keith so very quickly came to love Heather in a fierce and protective manner all the more moving because of how unexpected it was to him. Not many books have focused on gay dads, but there are far more gay fathers out in the world than people realize.<BR> <BR>What is compelling about this novel is that the reader truly comes to understand that there are no easy answers in custody battles, especially when the laws are not only subjective and imprecise, but also anti-homosexual. The tension and conflict were marvelously rendered. Depending upon whose point-of-view I was seeing things from, I found myself understanding that person's situation and being totally supportive of him or her. And then the perspective would change, and suddenly someone I thought was wrong came into focus as having valid claims and sympathetic issues. Everyone was right; everyonewas wrong; and there were no easy answers.<BR> <BR>The novel has a satisfying resolution, albeit one that becomes apparent to the reader long before the battling litigating parties catch on. Still, it's not a happy ending where everything is wrapped up by the last page. If these characters existed in real life, I know there would be pitfalls and future problems for them, but by the end of the story, I felt hope that little Heather would get the best of all worlds.<BR> <BR>This is a book for gays, lesbians, straights-for anyone interested in the ways that the law and prevailing attitudes have not kept pace with biology and all the possibilities of new family arrangements. It's an ambitious book full of heart and hope, and I highly recommend it.<BR>~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-08-03

The narrator, Miss Margaret Prior, is an upper class woman on the verge of turning 30, and when we become acquainted with her, she is making her first visit to Millbank Prison. She is to be the Lady Visitor-someone who comes to visit and motivate the pathetic denizens locked up for everything from petty crimes and prostitution to murder. Very quickly she becomes compulsively interested in a young woman, Selina Dawes, a spiritualist and medium in jail for harming a young girl and for involvement in the death of her benefactress.<br />Miss Prior's elaborate descriptions of Millbank, the incarcerated women, and her daily life at home soon reveal that she, too, is locked in her own private prison from which she has no way to escape. She's already had one \\"nervous\\" episode nearly resulting in her death. This followed the betrayal of a woman with whom she was smitten and the death of her dearly beloved father. She is a woman locked in a world with social mores that do not allow her to be herself-nor even to know who her real Self is. Only Selina has managed to introduce a little magic into her life.<br />With each passing week, the story builds in intensity as Miss Prior visits the dismal Millbank and attempts to see Selina Dawes as often as possible. Though she fights it, little by little, she surrenders to her feelings for the other woman. Will Selina manage to escape and will Miss Prior assist? Is the young woman truly innocent and wrongly convicted? We get clues from periodic diary entries made by Selina, but the mystery of the spiritualist's past is not revealed until the end.<br />AFFINITY has a feel much like the gothic novels of old, and the style and tone made me wonder if Waters could possibly be the spiritual daughter of Emily Brontë and Mary Shelley. The story's impact quietly creeps up on the reader until the surprising denouement, which, though it seems to come out of the blue, I realized I should have seen coming. I found myself thinking of this novel and Miss Prior's horrendous predicament for weeks. AFFINITY leaves a mark.<BR>~Lori L.

Meg Darcy works for her Uncle Walter, at Miller Security where they are steadily active in both investigations and security for local unions, businesses, and individuals. When a friend, Ann Yates, comes to Meg for help in the wake of her grandmother's murder, Meg reluctantly takes on the case. The old woman had apparently wandered away from a nursing home and was strangled by a serial killer who the cops have been unable to catch. <BR> <BR>In the course of the investigation, Meg meets up with an old acquaintance, the enigmatic and distant police detective, Sarah Lindstrom, to whom Meg has always been attracted. The further Meg delves into the case, the more contact she has with the taciturn cop, and it's only a matter of time before fireworks begin, both on the case and with Lindstrom. As it turns out, all is not as it seems in the cemetery murders.<BR> <BR>The story is told in first person, and Meg's sense of the world around her is wry and insightful. She is particularly amusing when pondering over the remnants of her love life. The cast of characters involved in this twisty mystery, including her best friend Patrick,  are richly drawn, and the writing is crisp and focused.

His roommate, Tim, is gay, but Kevin has been so busy with school that he has purposely not given it much thought. When Tim confronts him, Kevin ends up feeling rather glad they are going different directions upon graduation. Kevin flies out to the West Coast for an internship with a company that is helping to rebuild after a giant earthquake. He couldn't be more excited.<BR> <BR>And then the Visitors arrive. A race of oddly human-like space people touch down in several cities around the globe, including San Francisco, and nothing will ever be the same. Everyone around Kevin: his neighbors, his boss, new friends, and coworkers are profoundly affected by these new beings, especially when Kevin's company is given a contract to build a facility for them. By accident Kevin meets up with a Visitor named 'Bel, and their connection blossoms into a friendship. But is 'Bel so alien after all? And what's with the Visitors' periodic changes in skin color? They seem so human, albeit much larger, but they possess some odd characteristics, and they seem to be hiding something. Are they dangerous? What secrets do they carry, and where, exactly, are they from?<BR> <BR>Before Kevin can get to the bottom of his questions, political disasters and miscommunications occur, and the Visitors are expelled. 'Bel and his emissaries are very clear that certain actions on the part of the U.S. will have grave consequences upon his people and their world, but no one listens except Kevin, who has fallen for 'Bel. Now the young man is on a mission to unravel the Visitors' secrets in order to prevent the death and destruction of Visitors and millions of Americans.<BR> <BR>The secondary characters are critical in wrapping up the story and resolving the mystery of the Visitors. Very quickly the reader feels sympathy for Kevin and his struggle to deal with both his internalized homophobia and the new experiences that confront him. The book is a mystery, a coming out story, a sci-fi adventure, a romance, and an insightful twist on biblical themes and philosophical debates. Secret Matter is an enjoyable read most worthy of the Lambda Literary Award it won...	2003-06-27

She has red hair, is literally and figuratively hot-headed, and is still hurting from a breakup with Liam, a dashing character from the Village Militia. Ryna isn't looking forward to running into Liam over the next seven weeks at the Pendragon Festival, and she is in a foul mood at the beginning of the book.<BR> <BR>Bea Saunders' brother Daniel has finally talked her into assuming a role at the Ren-Fest. The kind-hearted Bea becomes Phoenix, an exceedingly cranky old herb-witch who, over the course of the book, develops a suitably caustic and funny way of dealing with the Festival patrons. Liam sets his sights on Bea, and she is flattered, but as the story goes on, it's not Liam she becomes emotionally entangled with but Ryna. <BR> <BR>So, at heart, this novel is a romance, but it is also oh-so-much-more. The book is immense, and every page is packed full of colorful characters, the hustle-bustle of the crowds, and all the wit and humor found at a Renaissance Festival. Seen mostly through Ryna's and Bea's different perspectives (with some flashbacks to the 1500s), the story unfolds at a pace in keeping with the best stories of old. I am reminded of all the interconnectedness of an Austen novel, the breadth and scope of Dickens' work, and the wit of The Canterbury Tales. <BR> <BR>Ultimately, Ryna and Bea's relationship is central, but there are so many sub-plots running throughout the novel that many of characters become dear to the reader's heart (mine being the gender-reversed Robyn Hood & The Merry Maids who count one lone male, Lord Marion, as a member. They get into a lot of funny scrapes.) <BR> <BR>The book truly is a tour-de-force about the Renaissance Faire traditions. From the Ashes contains a wonderful mixture of the Gypsy, Irish, Italian, and English characters we associate with the Olde World: Knights, Lords, and Ladies, peasants and witches, fairies and rogues, minstrels, fortunetellers, a little bit of Magick, and Harvey, the Privy Monster. To keep us on track, the author has provided a glossary of the peculiar lingo that the Rennies use as well as a character listing. <BR> <BR>If you enjoy Ren-Fests, King Arthur, Robin Hood, or stories about Merry Olde England, or if you ever wanted to be a part of a benevolent group working toward an entertaining and rollicking common cause, this book's for you. I highly recommend it.<br />~Lori L. Lake...	2003-06-27

The Germans have been repelled, and it's only a matter of time before the Allies prevail. Troops are on the move, as are many soldiers and staff who provide administrative support for the war effort. Pascale Tailland, an American translator, has been stationed in Germany, but now her unit is reassigned. The novel opens with Pascale and her fellow WACs on the train awaiting departure. She catches sight of a blond-haired youth whom she correctly assesses is a refugee. He is \\"gaunt, hardened, and bleak\\" but despite his desperate appearance, something is familiar. At the last minute, she pulls him aboard the departing train. And with one touch, Pascale is aware that this slender youth is not a man.<BR> <BR>The Polish Bronia \\"Bron\\" Rukowicz is passing herself off as Witold Rukowicz. She's escaped one forced labor camp and with cunning and verve is doing all she can to stay away from the horrors of the war. She has no desire to go back to the deprivations in Poland. After all she has been through, she is closed off emotionally. In conversation over the next few hours, Pascale gradually draws out the aloof refugee. When Witold tells Pascale that life is basically \\"cruelty, wars, and massacres,\\" Pascale insists that life itself gives meaning. Witold is quick to counter: \\"The only meaning I see is the law of the wolf, kill or be killed\\" (p. 22). She has stopped believing in goodness or altruism. This, the way of the wolf, has been the refugee's defense against the horrors she has encountered. <BR> <BR>For the rest of the short time they travel together, Pascale puts herself on the line in order to prevent Witold from being discovered and either captured or sent off to a refugee camp. By the time the two part, Pascale has made a crack in carefully constructed defenses, and Witold has fallen head-over-heels for the American. Pascale is also smitten.<BR> <BR>What follows is the fascinating, engrossing tale of these two women trying to find one another again in the chaos of the war-torn countries of Europe. Bron continues her masquerade as Witold, and her situation is much more dangerous and unpredictable. Both women have to find trustworthy helpers in order to track one another. Pascale's search and Bronia's arduous journey make for a gripping tale. I couldn't put this book down and read far into the night until I reached the surprising conclusion. <BR> <BR>Clarke's prose is fluid and literary, and she knows her history, not to mention more than a smattering of several languages. The details about Bronia's persistent attempts to survive are particularly rich. For instance, at one point, while locked up in the hospital ward of a camp, she is considering all possibilities for escape, and she realizes \\"every place could be escaped from if you looked hard and thought like a mouse.\\"  Bron's resourcefulness-and resilience-is truly a miracle. <BR> <BR>The Wolf Ticket is one terrific story. I highly recommend it and wish Clarke would publish another novel with great speed.<BR...	2003-06-27

Like the main character in the earlier book, Reap The Whirlwind's Will Keegan is a teenager whose life is turned upside down when he discovers he is gay. He is in no way prepared for the upheaval in store for him. He comes to understand that the person he's been in love with is hatefully homophobic. His father turns from him. Someone dear to him dies in a mysterious drunken accident. Will nearly dies, too. If that's not enough stress for one person, he meets someone special and is hardly able to discern that the young man is perfect for him.<br />Once Will gets his life into a precarious balance, he is able to see that the death of his friend is no accident even though the police have ruled it so. He and several friends (including Killian Kendall from the earlier novel) launch an amateur investigation which has dreadful results. There's another murder, then another, and no way of determining why. Who will be next? <br />Aterovis does an admirable job of showing the wild confusion and frequently uncontrollable emotions of young people as they attempt to understand their lives and make their way into adulthood. This book, essentially a very serious story, has occasional flashes of humor. My favorite line: \\"Oh my God, Martha Stewart died and left us all her sh-t.\\" The interplay between the young men and women, both straight and gay, feels accurate and alive. Above all, the message is clear that love and acceptance of self and others is critical, especially for young adults. Highly recommended for readers from high school on up.	2003-05-21

Once Will gets his life into a precarious balance, he is able to see that the death of his friend is no accident even though the police have ruled it so. He and several friends (including Killian Kendall from the earlier novel) launch an amateur investigation which has dreadful results. There's another murder, then another, and no way of determining why. Who will be next?     Aterovis does an admirable job of showing the wild confusion and frequently uncontrollable emotions of young people as they attempt to understand their lives and make their way into adulthood. This book, essentially a very serious story, has occasional flashes of humor. My favorite line: \\"Oh my God, Martha Stewart died and left us all her [stuff].\\" The interplay between the young men and women, both straight and gay, feels accurate and alive. Above all, the message is clear that love and acceptance of self and others is critical, especially for young adults. Highly recommended for readers from high school on up. ~Lori L.

It doesnt happen. Dave Brandstetter, claims investigator for Medallion Life Insurance Company comes to town. As he interviews family and friends, Dave discovers that all was not well in Fox Olsons charmed life after all. Did Fox commit suicide? Or kill himself? And if hes dead, where is the body? Dave thinks Fox disappeared on purpose, but in order to prove it, hell have to find the man. <br />Detective Dave Brandstetter is not only an appealing, sympathetic character, he is also a rugged, hard-drinking, relentless investigator with his own secrets. Hes just lost his lover of 20+ years to cancer, and he is well aware that he is not in good shape emotionally. Against the backdrop of his loss, Dave talks to the people of Pima, noses into old issues, and gets a possible lead on Foxs whereabouts. But there is more than one person in town with something to hide, and some of them may just be ready to kill to keep things quiet.<br />Author Joseph Hansen writes clear and delightful prose: the rust from the nailheads had written long, sad farewells down the salt-silver planks. Alternating captivating description with classic hard-boiled narrative, the author brings Brandstetters world alive, both inside and out. No wonder Hansen has been compared to classic mystery writers such as Raymond Chandler and Ross MacDonald.<br />Originally published in 1970, FADEOUT is remarkable in at least three ways: 1) the mystery features the first openly gay private detective, Dave Brandstetter, who is unapologetically homosexual and displays a solid strength and confidence that seems ahead of its time; 2) the writing is crisp, exciting, and exudes style beyond the level of the typical mystery; and 3) after over three decades, every aspect ofthe story and the writing holds up marvelously. Hansens work is destined to be deemed classic. The fact that Alyson has reprinted this debut novel and, so far, two of the eleven subsequent installments of the Brandstetter series bodes well for Joseph Hansens revival.<br />Lori L.

Well, that's how it looks on the surface. It is true that she's a freshman in college now, but she's not free. She is haunted by memories and nightmares of ... abuse suffered at the hands of her brother, Brad. No one would believe her, and her own father and sister could not understand her seemingly irrational antipathy toward Brad. She is relieved to escape her childhood home, but she doesn't find solace easily. Her roommate, Alisa, and her kind-hearted boyfriend, Patrick, don't seem to be able to help her either. Eileen is obsessed with finding out more about her brother and his life and motivations, and it's not until she embarks on a serious search that she can get to the truth of what compelled her brother to repeatedly [attack] her.<br />For some time there has been a growing movement in the realm of abuse and ... assault prevention: men have joined forces with women and organized to battle against [attack] and ... abuse. As a dedicated ... assault counselor, author Jim Hines brings a sensitive and compassionate viewpoint to this unforgettable story about one young woman determined to face and defeat the demons that haunt her.<br />This book is well-written and evocative. Not many male authors have created such a true portrait of a woman in pain and trouble. Hines has done it with effortless grace and with empathy and accuracy as well. This novel is for anyone trying to reconcile the terrors of the past with the hopes of the future. I highly recommend it.<BR>~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-04-29

Six otherworldly tales and two stories that one could classify into the mystery realm grace this excellent book. All are prefaced by a short description of how they came into being and how they were published. <br />Dalmas has a style reminiscent of Ray Bradbury. His stories flow effortlessly with occasional unexpected humor. It's easy to fall into his narratives. The Stoor's Map, for instance, which was originally published in the anthology Halflings, Hobbits, Warrows, and Wee Folk, contains gripping scenes of a battle with a huge spider. The characters, both male and female, are wonderfully rendered. In Out Of the North a Giant, the voice of the narrator is distinctive: \\"There come out of the north a giant. Teeth he had like knives, claws like more of em, and the breath from his mouth was like carrion in the sun\\" (p. 45). Whether the story characters are chasing-or being chased by-tigers or giants, or searching for killers as in Ides of September, every story is crafted by a master. If you love well-written short fiction that shades over into adventure, mystery, thrills, and chills, this one's for you.<BR>~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-04-29
US	41639692	RN4CBJVLTP4NE	1932300015	533082257	Wall of Silence	Books	5	35	36	N	N	Exciting, Engrossing, Not to be Missed!	This debut novel, part action, part police procedural, and part romance, is a real corker. Goldsby takes an oft-used character type-a burned out police detective-and builds a clever and engrossing plot around her. Lesbian LAPD cop Foster Everett hasn't even hit age 30 yet, and she's already seen one too many murders and far too many instances of abuse, neglect, and generally despicable behavior by the lawless element in her city. On the trail of snuff film porn purveyors, she and her partner, Smitty, go on what seems to be a routine bust at a video store. They find a small child chained up and capture the kidnapper. Foster loses her cool completely and beats him up. She goes outside to cool off and wait for backup, only to be told that the pedophile has suddenly died in their custody. Foster can't believe it; Smitty sends her away, saying he'll cover it up. <br /> <br />Foster has a conscience, and she can't quite bear the burden of guilt. In true messed-up-cop fashion, she starts drinking heavily. Then Smitty dies mysteriously, supposedly a suicide, and leaves her in a world of hurt. Still drinking heavily, she is spiraling downhill when she is befriended by Riley Medeiros, the bouncer at the lesbian bar. Before Foster has unearthed many clues about Smitty's death, much less her own problems, her life is in danger and she's forced to run. Riley becomes her rescuing angel.<br /> <br />What makes this story especially good is the effective integration of the growing affection between Riley and Foster as the stakes from running away get higher and higher. The relationship between the two women seems natural and doesn't interrupt the flow of the enigmatic mystery. But even with Riley's help and support, Foster's attempts to investigate from a distance and via friends in the department are met with deadly consequences. It becomes clear that if she is found, she's dead-and Riley and any friends, too. Can Foster uncover the truth in order to find out who is mastermindingthe murders and cover-ups before they get her?<br /> <br />The first person narration of the story is fresh and often sarcastically funny. \\"She even slept like an innocent...like she hadn't a care in the world. I slept like a criminal, balled up into a fetal position with one hand under my pillow where my weapon was usually hidden\\" (p. 130).  The novel is perfectly plotted and has a very real voice and consistently accurate tone, which is not always the case with lesbian mysteries.<br /> <br />Foster's gradual awakening to her own pain and to the resolution of the mess she is in makes for an exciting and satisfying read complete with several unexpected twists. In addition, Goldsby has done a fine job navigating the cross-genre nature of this book. For readers of lesbian action, adventure, and romance, Wall of Silence is not to be missed. I give it my highest recommendation.<br />--Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-04-29

All Rett's life, she's heard that voice in her head, and despite how far she has come in the 22+ years since she left home after high school, she still hasn't entirely shaken the doubts and negativity. This opening scene serves as a portent omen, for in the next few hours, Rett will discover that her lover/manager, Trish, has been cheating on her, that Trish doesn't love her and has used her all along, and worst of all, that Trish has blown the music deal of Rett's lifetime by being difficult and demanding. When the dust settles, Rett is alone, Trish has depleted her savings, and there are no big music gigs in the offing.<br />The breakup brings up painful old memories and is further complicated when Rett receives an invitation to her high school reunion from Cinny, Rett's unrequited love from her teen years. In the middle of all this change and confusion, Rett meets the familiar, but enigmatic Angel. The two are drawn to one another and share one night of passion--after which Rett promptly loses Angel's phone number. To make matters worse, that same day her agent calls with a long-term tour engagement which could solve money problems and give Rett a shot at reviving her music career. The catch is that she must leave town immediately to perform that very night. Will Rett ever find Angel again? What about Cinny and the reunion? How can she banish the cruel voice in her head? Rett knows she has a lot of issues to address.<br />One thing I have always liked about this author's style is her ability to render scenes with humor and with feeling. An example of the humor comes when Rett is sweating in a hot car. She cranks up the A/C because she \\"felt like a pot roast in a pressure cooker\\" (p. 118). In terms of evoking genuine feeling, I liked this sentiment: \\"Love crept into dark places she'd always known were there. In that instant, with the words she'd managed to say echoing in her head, all the dark places were suffused with light\\" (p. 239).<br />Karin Kallmaker has built a solid reputation by writing complex stories of believable, vulnerable lesbian characters who grow strong through facing tough issues. UNFORGETTABLE is vintage lesbian romance, continuing Kallmaker's string of well-written, thoughtful stories about women surviving difficult times and coming into their own.<BR>--Lori L.

When Regina joins the ER at St. Xavier's for her final rotation in the emergency services area, she's in for a lot more trauma and surprise than just the medical aspects. <br />Regina's chief attending doctor is Alex Margulies, a mercilessly driven perfectionist who possessing an unexpected past and an entire doctor's kit full of emotional issues. Her friendship with Regina comes as a complete surprise to her, and as it grows in intensity, Alex has serious choices to make. She's kept her past at bay for years, but if she is to have a future with Regina, she must face the consequences of her old life.<br />With the backdrop of internecine political battles, medical crises, the daily grind of long hours in the ER, and the constant responsibility of saving lives and losing patients, two women seek to forge a connection. Will their mutual attraction be thwarted by outside forces, both past and present?<br />The author writes with authority about the medical situations faced in a busy ER, and much of the book reads like a gripping and entertaining season's worth of episodes of Chicago Hope or ER.  An inviting debut from a talented writer, Second Chances is highly recommended for fans of well-written lesbian drama.	2003-02-27

She's got her father, former senator Benjamin Harrison, and her best friend, cop Malcolm Jefferson to lean on, but her world is empty without her beautiful and enigmatic lover. The police have no leads on the murder, and it might have ended up a cold case, except that Connor's house is ransacked and booby-trapped. If not for Malcolm's fast thinking, Connor and her father would both have been killed by the explosion. Now it seems clear that Ariana's death could be connected to Benjamin, but Connor is not sure how. <br />Time passes, and Connor comes to understand that she must get on with her life. She gets back to work and attends a writer's conference in New Mexico. A Navaho chauffeur, Laura Nez, shows up to squire her around-but is she trustworthy? Who is the culprit who stalks Connor leaving destruction in his or her wake? Is it a lone nut or a frightening conspiracy? And why was Ariana killed?<br />Gun battles, explosions, and high speed chases are nicely offset by Connor's introspection, by Laura's subtle humor and toughness, and by Maddison's literate style. Told from several points-of-view, the novel is plotted well and executed with grace. Oddly enough, the secondary characters in this debut novel (Laura and Malcolm especially) are more compelling than the protagonist, but there is plenty of room for Connor to grow in the subsequent books. The Native American \\"woo woo\\" spiritualism at the end was almost over the top, but ultimately didn't detract from this solid and entertaining first novel in what promises to be a compelling mystery series. <br />Fans of tightly plotted, exciting books such as Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series should like this book. My sole complaint is that the spine of the physical book did not hold up well after one reading, with pages threatening to pull away. This is a shame since DECEPTIONS is a novel many mystery readers will want to revisit.<BR>---Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-02-27

The sleuth, Sophie Greenway, is engaging, reflective, and entirely believable as a nosy but nice magazine food critic who gets plunged into the puzzling circumstances of the murder of her oldest friend's father. <br />In particular, the language and subtle humor are striking. Hart sets a nice balance between the grim realities of the murders and the relationships of the main and secondary characters. The narrative draws the reader in and keeps you hooked, whether we are finding out unexpected things about Greenway's friends and family or about the deadly plot that results in the murders.<br />After reading this first novel in the Sophie Greenway series, I was surprised to see it out of print. If this debut is any indication of the quality of the subsequent Greenway books, this series is well worth Ballantine reissuing it. <br />Other books recommended: M.D. Lake's Peggy O'Neill series, William Kent Krueger's Cork O'Connor series, and R.D.

The initial book, Common Sons, was published in 1989 and found a cult audience, particularly among youth, both gay and lesbian, who were struggling with their own coming out issues.  Then it took well over a decade to bring the sequel to fruition.  The Blind Season is that long-awaited sequel and is the continued story of Joel Reece and Tom Allen, two young men from Common, New Mexico.  The sequel picks up in 1970, four years after Common Sons left off.   The two boys are now young men who live together, work on Joel's parents' farm, and consider themselves married.  Though the townspeople continue to be suspicious, prejudiced, and unsupporting, Tom and Joel are mostly happy-but not entirely happy because they want children of their own.<br />The boys set out to find a young woman to carry their child, and they meet Sharon Minninger, who is a shunned Mennonite runaway living over the border in Mexico.  Sharon has dreams of her own, including getting an education and making something of herself.  She agrees to bear Tom and Joel's child in return for help to go to college.  The circumstances of the baby's conception, Sharon's pregnancy, and the little girl who is subsequently born bring strong feelings out in the open from the townspeople and from Tom and Joel's families as well.  The story of how they navigate all of this is suspenseful, dramatic, and touching.  While many people are against Tom and Joel - particularly the vicious, latent homosexual police officer in town - they gradually find others like Margaret, the low-key lesbian from the local diner, who support and encourage them.  In addition, there are some real surprises from members of their families.<br />This story evoked a tear or two along with a few chuckles.  It's lively, entertaining, and a highly effective sequel to Common Sons.  Mr. Donaghe is a talented writer who continues to puta realistic and reflective face on the gay young men about whom he writes. This is a book anyone from high school to age 100 could enjoy, and I highly recommend both this book and the series.<BR>~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-01-30

Upon completion of that trilogy, it seemed that the story of the Isis society and the two main characters, Whit and Kali, was completed.  Not so.  Stewart surprises and delights with a new trilogy beginning with Winged Isis.<br />The women of Isis live in Freeland, a democratic city-colony on one half of the U.S., which is protected by an invisible Border.  On the other side is Elysium where religious fanatics, corrupt men, and the regulators, a Gestapo-type of police force live violent, miserable lives.  The highly technological and deadly Elysium men want nothing more than to destroy Isis and take their resources, and only the Border shield powered from the satellites is stopping them.  They have been kept out for over eight decades, but now the Border shows signs of decay and breakdown.  <br />Tomyris Whit Whitaker and her psychologically adept partner, Kali Tyler, are leaders in Isis who want to prevent disaster before the Border breaks down.  The satellites which power the invisible shield must be repaired.  But there is dissension in the ranks as well as treachery and sabotage.  Can the satellites be repaired?  And what sacrifices will be made?  Kali is pregnant with their child.  Will they manage to maintain a society that is safe for their unborn daughter and for all children?  Or will they fall prey to the violent, fundamentalist Elysians?<br />Jean Stewart has created a fascinating society that is especially interesting because harmony is not necessarily the state of affairs in Isis.  Unlike many Utopias, the women of Isis disagree and fight about things, and power struggles are typical.  The secondary characters are strong and fully fleshed out, and provide a worthy counterpoint to Kali and Whits struggles on behalf of Isis.  <br />Stewarts writing style is crisp and clear.  She givesenough back story to thoroughly ground this new trilogy in the facts of the previous books without overwhelming the reader, and then she moves quickly into the meat of the conflict.  Unlike many sci-fi/fantasy stories, the author doesnt resort to magic and highly fantastical tricks.  The women in Isis are scientifically and psychologically gifted, and they use those talents as much as possible, but their society is not a world of sorcery and magicians.  This places Stewarts work in its own special category: a hybrid of science fiction, adventure, and romance in a uniquely lesbian framework.  <br />Winged Isis has a complex plot, a fast pace, compelling characters, and a surprise ending that will leave the reader excited and ready for the next book in the series, which, one can only hope, will be published soon.  Winged Isis is marvelous storytelling, and I give Stewart sincere kudos for bringing the women of Isis back to life again.<BR>~Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2003-01-30

Anne Henderson is the main character.  She's gone off to college, still in love with Gallagher, a high school friend who hasn't yet graduated. In the first half of the book, Anne goes through the normal college woes, including meeting Rae Sheldon, a bisexual party girl who doesn't seem to know what she wants and is destined to break Anne's heart, which she does quite handily.  Then fast forward eighteen years for the second half.  Anne has become a lawyer in a big firm and is working on an important case.  Both Rae and Gallagher come back into her life, as well as a new love interest, Rachel.  What will happen to Anne's love life?  What about her career and the big case?<br />Abbott does a nice job joining the two halves of this story and maintaining continuity.  Anne is definitely a bit jaded by the second half, but she is never a whiner and you can't help but like her and root for her.  Gallagher, Rachel, and Rae are all compelling characters, and the story, while not jam-packed with surprises, does offer up a couple unexpected twists.  <br />Written by an author with intelligence and skill, this thoughtful and entertaining story is sure to please readers.

Essentially a mystery and thriller, the story follows Jane and her friend Victoria, both of whom are upset about the bad treatment some of the horses in their area are receiving.  With a little digging, Jane uncovers sleazy conspiracies to steal, transport, and re-sell prize show horses.  When she sticks her nose in, all hell breaks loose and she very nearly loses her life.<br />The novel starts a bit rocky.  The side story of Anne's breakup with her girlfriend is necessary to later plot development, but doesn't endear any of the characters to the reader.  But once Jane actually begins investigating, McMahon's writing skill comes to the forefront and the mid-section of the book is gripping.  The last third of the book effectively mixes romance with mystery and intrigue.<br />As with her 1994 novel, McMahon has written a colorful and engaging story, with horses as the secondary characters.  The novel is entertaining and a quick read.  Of particular note is the terrific-and thematically perfect-book cover by ArtByLucy which packages the book beautifully.  <br />--Lori L.

Everest.  She's reached the summit twice before and comes to the expedition with more background and knowledge than the trip leaders and the odd assortment of experienced and greenhorn climbers. New York stockbroker Allison Peabody is a thrill-seeker who has spent considerable time and money on dangerous and extreme sports, unconsciously trying to get a reaction from her distant and uncaring parents.  She ponies up the $70,000 to join the expedition, and that's how she and the taciturn, mysterious Ricky Bouchard meet.<br />The story is essentially an adventure/romance, but not just between the two women; it's also about the age-old romance climbers have with a mountain that is awesome, unforgiving, and changing hourly before one's eyes.  The novel is long and filled with beautiful descriptions of the trek, including information about real-life climbers, some of whom failed and others who succeeded at reaching Everest's summit.  <br />Mountain climbers have to ascend and attempt to acclimate to the altitude, then come back down, then ascend again, going a little further each time.  Reilly tends to start chapters in media res, then go back and tell the reader some of what has transpired, and move on.  Stylistically, the narrative ends up mimicking the ups and downs of the expedition, and the book builds in drama the higher the group climbs.  Every step of the way, the reader wonders if anybody will make it to the top, and if so, who will it be?  And will they make it back or be lost in an avalanche or accident?  High Intensity is a satisfying read filled with good characterizations as well as the characterization of a mountain that has challenged and defeated many climbers since time began.  Like Reilly's other books, this one is a keeper.  <BR>---Lori L. Lake, Midwest Book Review	2002-11-03

Her best friend, Capi, is more than willing to explore something more than friendship, but Robin holds back, not knowing what's missing-until she meets the enigmatic Jessica Peters, the university's newly hired women's basketball coach.  For Jess, the college job is a dream come true. It's her first chance coaching at a Division 1 school, and to top it off, it's at her own alma mater.  She intends to have a season not only free of distractions but as perfect as her players can muster up.  Robin doesn't have exactly the same intentions.<br />The story is a complicated drama with a fair amount of angst and misunderstanding.  Surrounding all of that is the relentlessness of the basketball schedule and the fears that Jess harbors if she is to \\"come out\\" or be discovered as lesbian.  Will she succumb to the message from her heart?  Or play it safe and pass by a chance for a long-lasting relationship?<br />The book is well-written by an author of intelligence and skill.

Catherine LeVendeur, an 18-year old novice at the French Convent at Paraclete, is enlisted by the famous abbess Heloise to go on a mission to the Abbey in her hometown.  A psalter prepared at the convent, which Catherine was largely responsible for, has been altered in a way that accuses the famous scholar Abelard-and Heloise as well-of heresy, and Catherine is to inspect it and possibly retrieve it.  To carry out Heloise's plan, Catherine must return home under the guise of being disgraced for being willful and disobedient.  Once at home, her mother refuses to acknowledge her out of shame, and her father takes her to task for bad behavior.  Luckily, her handsome uncle Roger, her 16-year-old sister, and an old sculptor working on the construction of a new church are sympathetic.  Before Catherine can do much reconnaissance concerning the psalter, however, the sculptor dies under suspicious circumstances, and at this point, the story picks up speed as mysterious circumstances start piling up.  Not knowing whom to trust, Catherine must keep her own counsel, though she is determined to \\"kidnap\\" the psalter from the Abbey to get it to Abelard as well as find out if the sculptor's death was an accident or something more sinister.  Two more murders, a possible murder attempt upon Catherine, a mysterious stonemason, various knights, holy men, thieves, and rioters, along with a touch of romance, family politics, and political intrigue all come together in this lively and entertaining medieval mystery.  <br />Set in 1139 France, the story holds true to the gender limitations of the era while at the same time allowing Catherine spunk and forthrightness that surely many women back then possessed.  She plans to become a nun, instinctively knowing that the convent is one of the few places where she can read and think and reason about philosophy and ethical matters without censure.  But she never counted on what would happen to her in the outside world upon leaving the safety ofthe cloisters.  <br />This is an excellent mystery adventure, well told, by a writer with considerable skill and a remarkable background in medieval history.  The setting, plot and characterizations ring true, and we never get bogged down in the mundane historical recitations to which many other novelists might subject the reader.  Instead, like Ellis Peters' fine medieval mysteries, this top-notch novel rolls along toward a satisfying conclusion which left this reviewer wanting more.  It is fortunate that this is merely the first in a series of books Newman has written about Catherine LeVendeur.  I recommend it highly.	2002-10-27

Marika is in a world of hurt.  No relationship has ever lasted-except for an occasional loveless liaison with a woman named Cass, who uses Marika cruelly.  <br />Rhiannon \\"Rhi\\" Davies lives a hardscrabble existence in a shabby part of town.  She rents a room from her mean-spirited aunt who took Rhi in at age ten when the girl's parents died.  For years, Rhi has dreamed of escape from the critical, loveless aunt.  Since getting a paralegal certificate, she's saved every penny she can, planning and scheming to get out of her situation.  Rhi enters Marika's work life by taking a temporary paralegal job when the regular employee goes on maternity leave.  Marika and Rhi have almost nothing in common-except for their lack of faith in themselves or that they are worthy of love.  <br />When Rhi is attacked and badly injured by a crazed man in the office, Marika is shocked into compassion.  She takes Rhi into her home and cares for the convalescing young woman, and against all odds, the two women are drawn to one another.  <br />This might be a typical romance except for two things.  First of all, the writing is exquisite.  Every scene, every character, every detail is described with loving care.  The secondary characters, especially the kindly priest, the mean aunt, and several helpful friends, are well-drawn.  Secondly, the story doesn't end with the two women gaining rapport and falling in love.  Instead, Marika's past comes back to haunt them, dragging them into danger and near death.  The story ends up being more than a typical romance and is, in fact, a cross-genre thriller.<br />Told with a deft touch by a talented writer, BROKEN FAITH is an exhilarating story that gains power the further the reader gets into it.  There are so many twists and turns along the way, most of them unexpected, and the suspense grows gradually as the reader becomes aware of the breadth of the plot.  Simply put, this is a terrific book, and I recommend it highly.<br />-...	2002-10-05

Not so with this one.  Although Rogers shares ideas for getting around writing problems (procrastination, networking, writer's block, taking rejections, etc.), he concentrates on the entire world of being a writer.  He shares what he knows in essay format in such a way that any reflective, working writer can benefit.  I was especially taken by the chapter, \\"Death and the Day Job,\\" in which Rogers discusses the real reasons we should think about and focus upon our writing and why we do it.<br />This is a book for thinkers, doers, achievers, and all those who want to achieve in any realm of writing.  It reads like a wise mentor is sharing the information, and the entire book is peppered with humor and information about other writers and their processes.<br />I give this one high marks, right up there with THE COURAGE TO WRITE by Ralph Keyes, and LIVING THE WRITER'S LIFE by Eric Maisel.	2002-09-24

A victim of the teachings of the Light of Christ Ex-Gay Ministries, William had joined the ministry program to be transformed into a functional heterosexual. Instead, he's dead. Kelly can't get over William's senseless suicide nor can he exorcise the anger he feels at the holy rollers who promised his lover a \\"cure\\" for his gayness while filling the young man with shame and impossible expectations. Nine months later, still bitter and lonely, Kelly decides to go undercover to expose the chicanery of the church's ex-gay recruiting program.<br />In the heat of summer, Kelly and ten other men arrive at the Lion's Mouth Christian Ranch in New Mexico's Guadalupe Mountains for the 18-week program. And so begins a compelling and gripping story as Kelly attempts to maintain his individuality and common sense in the face of religious fundamentalism, inadequate nutrition, brainwashing, and predatory behavior by some of those in charge.<br />The epistolary narrator gradually draws the reader into the the bizarre rules of the camp, a world where mostly miserable, self-hating men try to squelch their natural inclinations. They're watched closely as they eat poorly prepared meals in a mess hall, sleep in a tent together, and work in small teams like prisoners or soldiers. At 35, Kelly is one of the oldest recruits. Earlier in life, he had been in the military, but the contrast between Army life and this experience is remarkable, and he writes, \\"Free time in the army was not gloomy. Guys played cards, cursed and laughed, wrestled, slapped each other on the shoulders, or fought loudly. Here, except for the scratching of pens on paper, the turning of a page, or the sniffling of a runny nose, I can almost hear the thoughts of the recruits like a continuous whispering, or a sibilant stream of rushing water, washing over rocks. No one is happy.\\"<br />Even in the mind-numbing and restrictive environment, and despite rules against getting close to the other men, Kelly makes friends. This includes Michael, who is only a minor character, but is very endearing and further raises Kelly's feelings of protectiveness toward his fellow recruits. As time goes on, Kelly suspects that some of the men are being maltreated after hours and while on certain isolated work details. Sure enough, a series of events occur that verify his suspicions, and along the way, the author ramps up the tension. Will Kelly be a victim, too? Will the camp officials (particularly \\"Paul, the chipmunk Nazi\\") discover that Kelly is a spy? Are they all in danger? Who will get out alive?<br />Donaghe is a talented author with a deft touch. He does a frighteningly convincing job showing the sincere and pious surface the camp preacher and the main henchmen project while Kelly subtly describes the angry, hateful, homophobic underpinnings of their tactics. The minister is a caricature of a preacher, not really a bad man, just misguided and too stupid to see the evil two feet beyond the edge of his vision. Nor does the preacher see that the real evil does not come from the recruits, but from his own trusted camp leader.<br />At times violent, gritty and rough, the novel is increasingly intense, but it is not entirely without humor. Kelly has a wry way of looking at the world.  Still, the Salvation Mongers is not a book for the faint-hearted. The violence, brainwashing, and shaming that occurs hurts one's heart while, at the same time, it mirrors the internal struggles that the men are faced with. It is Kelly's optimism, his belief in his own goodness, and his strength of heart that carry this book through to the end, at which point the reader will have completed a journey with him. That journey ultimately affirms that the acceptance of one's sexual orientation--and that of others--should not be shame-filled and full of pain.<br />Lori L.

US	41639692	RPJ0QALDEXWCT	1930928564	946071248	Vendetta	Books	4	5	6	N	N	A New Voice in Lesbian Action Novels	Nicole Stone is a big city, veteran cop on the East coast. She's cynical and hard-nosed, not to mention closed-off from most people. She lives her life like so many cops do: with a great big wall up around her. All that changes when two things happen: her male work partner is shot and nearly killed, and his sister, Carly Jamison, flies into town.<br />The investigative aspects and the driven quality of Nic's search for the culprits who attempted to kill her partner is the center of the book. I was a ways into this novel when I realized that a lot of the fiction written by, for, and about lesbians doesn't usually have much action in it--not action/adventure, I mean. Talaran has done an especially good job on the scenes where Nic Stone has to deal with the bad guys. The growing relationship between Nic and Carly is important, too, but unlike many romance novels, it doesn't hog center stage. In the end, Talaran has done a good job juggling the two interwoven plots--one of action/police work and the other of the growing attraction between the two women.<br />Talaran has written a solid first novel which is set-up nicely for a sequel. VENDETTA has a complete and satisfying ending, but one is left wondering what will happen to the relationship Nic and Carly began to explore in this first book. I look forward to the next novel so that I can find out.	2002-05-18

And then one of the leaders dies, leaving one heir, Nimri, and she is expected to pick up the staff of her grandfather, who was Keeper of the Peace.<br />And then along come interlopers, Colonel Larwin Atano and his female android, the likes of which the people of Chatterre have never seen. Nimri is fascinated by the two, though she doesn't understand half of what they say or do and considers that they must be Gods. Larwin, too, is fascinated by and attracted to Nimri, though at first, all he seems to care about is how to conquer and profit from this planet upon which he has crash-landed.  Soon, however, a new threat awakens, one much worse than the conflict between the two clans. <br />Foguth weaves a story of a conflict that is ages-old as well as new conflicts for Nimri, who feels unprepared to protect and care for her people in her new role. The way that Nimri goes about trying - with the help of Larwin, the android, her 800 pound pet \\"cat\\" Kazza, and various others - makes for an engaging and interesting story.	2002-05-18

As a writer of lesbian novels myself, I have been constantly surprised to discover how many women seem to be living double lives: wife and mother by day--secret, internet-accessing, coming-out lesbian by night. When women email me to confide and ask advice (which I feel inadequate at giving!), I refer them to this book knowing that the stories of the women in FROM WEDDED WIFE TO LESBIAN LIFE will give them hope and ideas.<br />Great editing work by Deb Abbott and Ellen Farmer, and kudos to Crossing Press for publishing this fine book. <br />In addition to this book, I would also recommend: LESBIAN EPIPHANIES: WOMEN COMING OUT IN LATER LIFE by Karol Jensen.

Even though it's been 19 years since I read it, I still remember Harlan Brown and Billy Sive quite clearly.<br />19 years from now, I suspect I will still remember Joel Reece and Tom Allen, too. Many of the events in COMMON SONS, set in Common, New Mexico, are played out on a daily basis in every small town across the U.S.  Two young men begin their voyage of discovery about themselves, their sexual orientations and identities, and neither of them, nor their families or town, will ever be the same.<br />What I liked best about this book was that neither boy is a stereotype, and there are no easy answers to the conflicts that arise. Joel is a popular junior, a talented boxer, who won a state title the previous school year. He's not sure, but he thinks he would like to follow in his father's footsteps and be a farmer. Tom is the new kid in town, a preacher's son, and he's a senior.  He's handsome enough that many of the girls are interested in him. But he only has eyes for Joel.<br />The fact that gay and lesbian kids across the country manage to find one another and build relationships and community is a testament to the strength and perseverance we all possess.  Despite almost no resources, few open-hearted adults, and a whole lot of religious condemnation, Tom and Joel fall in love and determine to stay together, through thick and thin. This is not to say that they don't face terrible barriers, not the least of which is the enmity of small-minded and homophobic individuals in their town.  Still, the courage Tom and Joe display is remarkable. It is a tribute to them that they open their own hearts to others, too.  I can already see that they will, in their own ways, make a huge impact on the Common community.<br />Ron Donaghe has written a book full of heart and hope. His style is clear and clean, and every scene is finely crafted by a writer of great talent.  I very much look forward to starting the next book in the series, THE BLIND SEASON.	2002-03-15

Told from Kat Jenkins' first person point-of-view, the story is engaging and realistic. Kat comes to the family vacation house with her best buddy, Mel, in order to put more than one ghost to rest -- but she didn't bargain for a summer romance. <br />In particular, I liked the fact that Jenn and Kat seem like real people. Jenn is very tall and solid, not a thin, gorgeous waif. Kat is smaller, but not described as a runway model. Given the fact that few of us look like Angie Harmon or Julia Roberts, it was nice to read about &quot;normal&quot; characters.<br />The book was short...but it was plenty long enough to serve up some steamy love scenes and an appropriate level of angst and indecision. By the time you get to the end, you will agree it was a Wild Sea, but we were spared from the Hurricane.<br />I look forward to reading Montague's BARNFIRE next.

Redmann manages to pull the reader along through three interwoven tracks: 1) the basic mystery that PI Micky Knight is dealing with, 2) the daily and often amusing life Micky lives, and 3) the mystery of her past and how she became who she is.<br />The story line is well-written--I mean, it has DEPTH.  So many mysteries are fun fluff.  Redmann manages to weave a tale that is so much more than just a mystery.  Micky Knight's smart-ass, oddly observant point-of-view is funny and catchy, but under the cool quips, the character is DEEP.  <br />I had a tough time getting hold of a copy of this book and the next one in the series, but I don't regret the trouble I went to.  I can't wait to keep reading!  And I agree with Litterati: if Knight were straight, people would be tossing aside their Grafton and Cornwall and Paretsky mysteries in favor of Redmann's!<br />Jolly good job!<BR>:) Lori L.

What's a lesbian doing reading a gay memoir?<BR>Enjoying the honesty and humor of a well-written life story. <br />Ronald L. Donaghe may be better known for his fiction (The Blind Season, Common Sons, Uncle Sean), but his own life story certainly lacks for no excitement.  As an Airman First Class during the early 1970's, Donaghe writes about a slice of time in his life when he was nowhere near as comfortable with his sexual orientation as he must be now, given the fact that he has become a bestselling gay fiction writer since then.<br />The narrative is well-written and peppered with pithy observations.  With honesty, he explains what it was like to be young, gay, and closeted from his family and friends--and even from himself.  In denial, he married young and fathered a child before coming to grips with that folly.  One would think that joining the military would have been yet another misstep, but instead, the military atmosphere actually assisted him with coming to grips with and accepting his sexual orientation as well as extricating himself from a bad marriage.<br />I found some of the boot camp description rather droll, and it was amusing to learn that so many soldiers during the Vietnam era were too high on drugs to care about Donaghe's sexual orientation. Nowadays, being \\"out\\" in the military often brings attacks and court martial.  For Donaghe, it seems that the U.S. Military served as a safe place where he could come to terms with his sexuality.<br />Like Ricardo Brown's recent memoir, THE EVENING CROWD AT KIRMSER'S, about gay life in 1940's St. Paul, Ronald Donaghe tells another piece of the gay experience, this time from a soldier's point-of-view.  I highly recommend his honest and forthright memoir and think it deserves a place in the canon.<br />-[....]	2002-01-22

The co-ed murders are a bit grisly, but they make sense at the end, and the exciting unmasking of the murderer and the fallout from its denouement are capably handled with good pacing, flow, and narrative. I also liked the fact that the book's wrap-up didn't take place in a quick summary, but rather unfolded in a satisfying manner.<br />Along with other books like Trish Kocialski's FORCES OF EVIL, R.S.

It's an excellent story, ably told, and certain to be just the first of many novels from a talented and capable new author.  I highly recommend it!	2001-11-26
