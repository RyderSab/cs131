Kuffel, at age 42, weighed 313 pounds. After joining a 12-step program, she lost 188 pounds. <br />Kuffel begins by explaining what her life was like at 300+ pounds. I recognized so many of my own thoughts and feelings in what she said. <br />As other reviewers have noted, once Kuffel joins the program, she seems to lose her weight over a few pages. There's barely anything of the struggle to get started and stay on her program. She seems to move right into being thin and adjusting to her new life. That's the only disappointment here for me. I would have liked to hear more about what she did, how she felt while she lost weight, etc.<br />Despite it's shortcomings, I would recommend this to anyone. She has a wonderful sense of humor, and is a great storyteller.	2004-01-19
US	52853801	R3A7QJ6H03MZ24	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Great novel....until the end	I read Sebold's _Lucky_, a memoir about her rape, a few years ago, and I was looking forward to her first piece of fiction even without all the media hype.  <BR>    The story begins with the murder of a 14-year old girl,...   She tells of her murder,...  <BR>  My only issues with this novel deal with the ending....I can't reveal anything, as they would be huge spoilers.  I felt that some of the things that happened were just too weird and some of the events tied things up too neatly.  <BR>  On the whole, though, this was one of those novels you can't break away from.  I was sad to come to the end as I knew I would miss Susie.	2002-07-19

And I wasn't disappointed.  <BR>    It's told through a serious of letters from Charlie, a freshman in high school, to an anonymous person.  The novel is almost like a journal as Charlie reveals what he is experiencing and feeling.  He is the kind of person who thinks way too much, and neglects to really live in the moment.  He seems to be near depression most of the time, but a supportive teacher and two great friends help him. There's a little bit of everything in this novel- teen angst, teen love/lust, drugs, homosexuality...it's just an amazing piece of literature.  I highly recommend it.	2002-07-19
US	52853801	RKZE30BI0H63B	0060921145	815704642	Animal Dreams	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of her best	I have to admit, I've been a fan of Kingsolver's for years, and Animal Dreams is one of my favorite novels.  <br />Codi returns to her hometown to watch over her ailing father, with whom she's had a rather difficult relationship. Her sister, Hallie, goes to Nicaragua to teach people how to farm the land, while facing the threat of violence.  Codi is a medical school dropout who seems to wander from place to place, trying to find herself, in a sense.  She is determined to stay in her hometown for only a year, accepting a teaching position on a temporary basis.  Kingsolver gives us a lesson in politics, life, and love in Animal Dreams.  Yes, at times she can be a bit overbearing with her political beliefs, but who can fault someone for having passion?	2002-06-05
US	52853801	R2LAEY5OCT3YWI	0373250126	471365971	Milkrun	Books	1	15	18	N	N	Skip this one	Jackie is 24 year old single woman who recently moved to Boston to be near her boyfriend Jeremy. Of course, before he moves,  Jeremy decides he needs some time alone touring Thailand to 'find himself.'   Before he leaves, he suggests that they see other people, and she says nothing.  Of course, during the course of his trip, he finds someone, and sends Jackie an e-mail telling her that he's seeing someone.  Jackie decides to make him regret his decision, and starts going to a local bar, Orgasm, with her friend, to try to meet a new man...and of course Jeremy eventually comes back into her life...and well, I won't ruin the end.<br />One of the biggest things that annoyed me about this book was the extremely poor editing.  There were misspelled words everywhere, which is rather ironic considering Jackie is a copy editor!  One would think that they would take the time to at least check for misspelled words.<br />I found Jackie and the other female characters to be extremely shallow and weak.  It seemed that their lives revolved around finding a boyfriend, as if they couldn't survive without a man.  Jackie oscillates from liking Jeremy, to her high-school crush Jon, to Tim, to Andrew, to Jeremy, to Andrew....it seemed like a different man every chapter.  She started to like any man who paid attention to her.  Andrew touches her shoulder at one point, and she 'realizes' that she likes him.  Please. One would think she would take a step back and try to figure out what she really wanted....but she felt like nothing without a man.  <br />I'm extremely disappointed in this novel.  I enjoy books in this genre, and this is by far the lowest-caliber one I've read.  Skip this one.	2002-04-01

She is strong,smart, honest, and she doesn't care what people think about her. She realizes that she is a lesbian early in her life, and she makes no apologies for it. <br />We follow Molly from her childhood through her 20s, and she hardly shows a sign of weakness throughout the whole novel, despite not being treated well by her mother, and facing difficulties dealing with men at film school. Which is admirable, but...well, perhaps quite realistic. I walked away feeling that Molly just wasn't developed enough as a character. She seemed very two-dimensional to me, perhaps because she didn't show any weakness. Or maybe I'm just jealous that she could be so strong.....	2002-03-20

I thought this would be one of those books. I was prepared to hate it. But I was happily mistaken.<br />Yes, Cannie is overweight and in her late 20s. But while she experiences those self-doubts and insecurites that all of us in our 20s experience, Cannie doesn't find solace in a crash diet. She doesn't go running back to that old boyfriend, Bruce, though she does waver a bit. She finds the strength in herself to leave him out of her life (as a boyfriend)forever, even when she discovers that she's pregnant with his child. She decides to raise the child on her own, and doesn't lament about it. <br />Cannie does find true love in the end, but the reader isn't left feeling that Cannie NEEDS a man in her life because of a sort of dependence, like most characters in other books. Cannie can certainly take care of herself and her child. But Cannie does find love, and I was so happy for her. Everything came together in the end for her. She is one of those characters I will miss greatly. <br />Thank you so much, Ms. Weiner, for writing a novel with such an admirable character that we twenty-somethings can relate to. I look forward to your next novel.	2002-01-16

I just read the first Harry Potter book last week after holding out for so long.....and I thought I'd &quot;eventually&quot; get to reading the 2nd book....but I found myself devouring it last night.  I just needed to know about Harry's next adventure...<br />In The Chamber of Secrets, Harry finds his way back (in a most unconventional way) to Hogwarts for his second year.  Soon, students turn up petrified by some unknown force, rumors of a Chamber of Secrets start running through the school, and we find out some of Hagrid's secrets...and...well, you'll have to read it for yourself.  And read it you must!<br />For those stressed, over-worked adults out there, Harry Potter will surely bring a bit of your childhood back to you and help you through the day.	2002-01-03

And light is exactly what I got.  <br />I won't get into a summary here as enough reviewers have done that already.  I will agree with what another reviewer said-- using rape as a plot point in this book was just...wrong.<br />It was painfully obvious right from the beginning that Dig and Nadine would end up together....and it almost wasn't necessary to read the middle part of the book.  I found myself skimming some parts, just knowing that Dig's love for Delilah wouldn't go anywhere, and knowing that he would eventually realize that he loved Nadine.  <br />Not a bad read, if you're looking for something light.	2001-12-27

When it first came out, and everyone started clamoring to get it and raving about it, I just didn't want to jump on the bandwagon.  But when I saw the previews for the movie, and saw the book available in paperback....I gave in.  I had to see what it was about.<br />I'll skip the summary, as I'm sure everyone pretty much knows what it's about.<br />Once I started reading, I found myself absorbed in Hogwarts and....well, I couldn't put the book down.  And the ending-- I was taken completely by surprise.  I also didn't want the book to end-- thankfully, I've already purchased the next book and will start that tonight.<br />So, for those of you who are avoiding Harry Potter, perhaps you should re-think your decision.  You may find yourself actually enjoying it.	2001-12-27

Maybe if I had kept on reading after 40 pages, I would have found something to make reading this one worthwhile.  But after 40 pages, I put it on the pile of books to get rid of. <br />I think Israeloff meant well.  She was going through something millions of woman go through.  She wanted to tell her story and help someone.  And maybe she has.  But instead of reading through her journal entries like I thought it would, or reading about her struggle to grow up and into the woman she wanted to be, I read something which resembled a young adult novel. I read about her classes, her assignments, her teachers....and I just didn't care at all.  What does an assignment in junior high have to do with anything?  Maybe I'm missing something...but I doubt it.	2001-02-07

As a young adult, I devoured every Stephen King novel in print, making sure that I read _It_ every summer.  As I grew older, I moved away from King, heading toward more &quot;respectable&quot; novels.  I began to fall under the spell of King critics, unfortunately.  <br />I bought _On Writing_ because I...well, I'm not sure. I just did.  And boy am I glad.  I remembered why I loved King's novels so much-- they were fun to read.  You don't have to think about symbolism, or theme, you just read them and enjoy the story.  That's what it's all about, and that's the way it should be.  King spends the first part of the book discussing scenes from his life that influenced his writing, and the second half on tricks of the trade. Reading the whole book was like talking to an old friend.  Corny, but true.  King speaks openly about the publishing industry, and more importantly, what makes a good writer.  Most of the information was not new to me, but I liked that King wrote it all in his usual 'down to earth' way.  I think it will be helpful for writers who are unsure of what they need to do once they have a piece they'd like to publish.	2001-02-06

I found myself able to relate to every episode in Shannon's life.  I even wondered if Michael was based on my ex-boyfriend. <br />This is a must-read for every woman-- not just those in  their 20s and 30s. I found myself taking stock of my life, wondering if  I've really *found* myself.  Wondering if I, too, depend too much on a man.   I laughed along with Shannon and understood her every neurosis.

When it's time for a new release, I'm at the bookstore when it opens that morning.  I devoured The Poisonwood Bible in just a couple of days.  Kingsolver has an  incredible gift for making her stories come alive-- and seem so real that  you feel like you could just close your eyes and step into the village.  I  can't begin to describe how I felt when I read this book.  And though I  don't agree with Oprah's methods of choosing her book club selections, I  can console myself by the thought that perhaps a few Oprah readers will  discover the world of Barbara Kingsolver and enjoy her as much as I do.	2000-07-11

Leah, and the children.  I just don't.  The only character I found that had some semblance of life was Marthe Ballou, and she's dead already.   I'm only halfway through the book and I just want to throw it against the  wall because I'm so disappointed.  After reading all the glowing reviews, I  decided to shell out the extra cash and buy the hardcover.  I wish I  hadn't.  Lent wants to be a spectacular writer, and I suspect that he has  it in him, but he's trying too hard.  This book is in serious need of a  good editor.  Too much useless verbage and characters with no life.  I'm  going to plod my way to the end, though, and I hope that I'll change my  mind by the last page.	2000-07-06

I found myself hoping that Dana  would be able to live the life she wanted- with Allison.

It seems that most of the essays written in this book were written by young drama queen girls who just wanted to be tortured souls. Yes, there were some valid essays that enlightened me, but some of them would have been better left in thier private journals where they can fantasize about all the pain and suffering they are enduring. Most of these girls need to learn about what it's really like being a woman-- a strong, independant woman.	2000-06-21
