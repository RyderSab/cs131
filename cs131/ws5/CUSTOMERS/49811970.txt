US	49811970	R3HZU4MC6Z4I86	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Cyberpunk Pizza Delivery	Around half-way through this book, I needed to put it down for a bit.  It all seemed a bit too much.  Neal Stephenson writes in a way that is shocking.  The subject matter is so over the top that it shouldn't make any type of sense.  Why would skateboards use harpoons on cars?  Who goes to Pizza college?  Why does the main character carry a Katana?  <br />But it really all does make sense.  That's why the book seems overwhelming.  The future he paints is so bizzare that it's easy to understand.  Unlike Neuromancer with it's &quot;plausible&quot; 1980's view of the future, this book takes the future, puts in everything random and ties it together in a way it all makes sense.  <br />Even further, the language in the book is great as well.  It's not filled with cursing, like many a cyberpunk book, and it feels upbeat despite the fact it's dystopian.  A line that stood out to me in it is where they talk about Rastarfarian gunslingers in Compton.  They never went into detail when you read it, but it makes sense.<br />This book is a reccomend for either fans of Cyberpunk, or fans of the obscure, and slightly strange.	2004-01-28

Gibson does craft an amazing world, blah, blah, blah.  We all know how that goes.  Unfortunately, yes, this book is very hard to follow.  Case, the main character, will randomly slip into dreams because he is either asleep or even more confusingly stuck in the Matrix, and &quot;flatlined&quot;.  Over all though, this book does get a point across and leads to many questions about Computers and how much faith we do put in them.  <br />Overall though, this book has some heavy philosophy about not only a darker future, but also dealing with issues of technology, poverty and corporate expansion.  If your interested in Sci-Fi, or even watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; and wondered where some of these ideas had come from, you should be familiar with this book.	2003-05-28

Having been one of the people who was lucky enough to translate the Nag Hammadi Codicies, Pagels has possibly the best insight into these esoteric writtings.  <br />Her book, although taking some quotes from Nag Hammadi, largely focuses on the points of comparisson between the early Christian Gnostics and the Orthodox Gnostics in the early days of the Roman Empire. Using what was learned from the Nag Hammadi Codicies, she is able to more cohesively argue both sides of the formally one sided argument against the Gnostics.  Using numerous quotions from an old book called &quot;Ibid&quot; by Ireneaus, where the Gnostic movement was strongly bashed as heresey.  Although, many of these arguments are refuted, and it clearly makes a mainstream Christian reader at the very least question his or her faith, it doesn't delve enough into the actual philosophy about Gnosis that was given in the Nag Hammadi Codicies until the very end.  This perhaps was the major flaw of the book, although it showed the Social aspects of Gnosis, she didn't delve deeply into the really esoteric philosophies.  Perhaps, this is because she is coming from an objective standpoint of that of a researcher.  <br />Overall, this book is extremely strong in explaining the Gnostics, and is even at least the first primer a person should read before diving into the Nag Hammadi Library.	2003-03-22

After reading snippets of it, like I would the bible, I realized that I was nearly in over my head.  This book is confusing. Many others who I've spoken to have advised that one reads many books about the Nag Hammadi findings before they read the actual findings.  They couldn't be closer to the truth.  Besides the fact that it's confusing, it's a common Gnostic belief that you must learn from a teacher before learning on your own.<br />On that note, despite how useful this book is.  I'd advise anyone, at all interested in the subject matter, to first look for books by Elaine Pagels and Stephan Hoeller, first to get an idea of what you can expect to actually be reading.	2003-03-22

The authors are generally British, and speak with British accents, confusing an American when they speak of certain pronunciations.<br />This book was no exception.  I bought this book, planning on brushing up some more with my &quot;North American Spanish&quot; (the type an American learns in School, which is essentially a mix of numerous dialects, and depends on who your teacher learned from). The problem is this book teaches hardcore Castillian Spanish, which sounds slightly different and doesn't have the traditional flow that an American is used to.  Regardless, this book simplifies grammer greatly, and is able to explain some of the easiest concepts of survival Spanish with relative ease.  This book is clearly for begginers though, because it only teaches Usted, which is the formal word for you, for most of the chapters only introducing the informal &quot;tu&quot; later.  This seems rather absurd because they make it seem extremely informal, although this is just to cut down on the verb endings, but one needs to learn them all at once instead.<br />Besides all these mistakes though.  The book does teach a begginer Spanish as it intended to, and can probubly do that rather quick.	2003-03-22

Demon is a superb game, and tottally seems to be fitting the White-Wolf concept of the final days, but also manages to portray the typical duality that it's games seem to hold.  On the one hand, not all demons are crazed and want to be evil, most of them fight against it.  On another hand demons also fight between holding onto hope or becoming completely fatalist.  This part of the plot is fine, the game is fine enough, although it restricts things more to Judeo-Christian philosophy a bit more then usual (it doesn't do it exactly).<br />My only true gripe is that White-Wolf has done this for expansion and money. It's become almost a white-wolf trend to increase the amount of supernaturals running around solely because they need new projects.  You can only write about but so many cities that Vampires live in.	2003-03-15

Unfortunately the strength of the actual translation is killed, and unfortunately this bible has no soul to be saved, because of the actual study notes which are pretty silly at times.  They try to remain non-demoninational but seem to be courting towards the Moderate-Conservative Christians the closer you get to the Gospels.

It is essentially Abdul Baha explaining to a student of his certain key questions, from the importance of nature, to connections to Christianity.  He even mentions workers rights, and many topics relating to the early 20th century.  This book as a religious text seems slightly odd, because most of the concepts aren't to foreign and can directly be applied to a person living an Euro-American lifestyle.  All this, and I'm not even an actual Baha'i.	2003-03-15

A most interesting aspect of the story is how Okonkwo is well off, and a nearly perfect protagonist, but still ends up going through un-told hardships.  The feeling of this book is further completed with the use of the native religion of the Ibo being real.<br />This book makes one question colonialization in a different light as well, because the book shows how the process of colonialization was slow but largely unstoppable... and scary in a sense.	2002-12-16

Assata's story revolves mostly around her transfer from Prison in New York and New Jersey and the conditions she faced. These were all shocking, especially because I live in New Jersey.<br />She goes into her past as well, detailing her experiences with leftist, and the Black Panther Party.  She reveals these in a more objective stance, and she dispells the myth that the Black Panther Party was perfect and why she left.  My only real complaint is that she doesn't explain enough about the Black Liberation Army, and never, for security reasons, says who shot the officer on the turnpike.	2002-12-16

It is a story about hopelessness, and struggle.  It is a story where a man who shouldn't go anywhere but to jail, or a one way road to hell finds his way out of Harlem, and makes to a law school.  The book explains everything in detail though, it is sensed that Mr. Brown doesn't really regret what he did because it got him where it did, and as such is an inspiration for other black boys in the ghetto, knowing that they can amount to something better.  <br />This is one of the few stories that brought me to tears for reasons other then sadness.	2002-10-06

One could learn some basic Swahili phrases from this and even think in Swahili numbers, but besides that, it is mostly a tourist manual, and unless you plan on being in rural East Africa, and are very polite, do you need to really know tourist Swahili if a large majority of the people will already have the ability to understand you in English?	2002-09-27

So I've always liked that.  Suprisingly though, Guide to the Camarilla was good also.  Even though alot about these guys is covered they at first seemed weak when compared to the Sabbat but then you see how these guys get stuff done.<br />The Guide to the Camarilla is like the polar opposite of Guide to the Sabbat.  The opening fictions in both books synch up and you wonder who really wins.  The first chapter goes into more detail about the Camarilla traditions and laws.  The next chapters cover other important information like the Gangrel leaving the Camarilla.  It also details the Caitiff, Gargoyles(which are Vampires) and Lasombra Antitribu.  <br />The rules chapter is very long.  It details not only Vampire powers but has a long list of merits and flaws, abilities and backgrounds.  It is very useful, especially considering it gives quite a few thaumaturgy paths.<br />The book ends with Character templates and a few bits on the Anarchs, Elders and Innocu, but not much on the Innocu.<br />All in all, the book is well worth the price for anyone who wants to run a strong Camarilla game but I'd still recommend Guide to the Sabbat first.	2002-04-29

I've always found an attraction to the Lasombra but never the Sabbat as a whole.  This book changed my perception.  The Sabbat isn't a group of mindless killers as the Camarilla makes them seem, they are Crusaders against the ancient ones who would destroy them.<br />The books intro \\"Smart Moneys on Vegas\\" is very nice and is probubly my favorite opening fiction.  It captures the mood of the Sabbat and keeps you moving through the introducion area that explains the Sabbat structure and internal strife. <br />The book moves to the numerous Anti-Tribes of the Sabbat and even special bloodlines that previous reviewers mentioned.  One that didn't fit in to me though was a group called the Kiasyd, they are like Faeries but Vampires also... I don't see where they fit into the Sabbat or any sect for that matter.<br />The discipline section was medicore.  Nothing to new, or ground breaking.  Especially considering the neutral disciplines like Auspex are in Guide to the Camarilla.  The path section is rather interesting, especially since it drills in that many sabbat aren't on paths and stick to humanity, most people can't take pathes dangers.<br />The section detailing Sabbat tactics for taking cities is amazing and a story based around a siege would be amazing.  The tactics are varied especially due to Sabbat disciplines and considering that they already are good at fighting makes me wonder how the Sabbat could ever lose.<br />This book was very good all in all but my one complaint is that it really doesn't say much about what a Sabbat city really does when it isn't crusading?  They weed each other out?  Well, this book is still worth the price.  It's information is invaluable.	2002-04-29

It is longer then the mage core book infact and most of this is in-character information.  This is slightly annoying because of the amount of information one needs to wade through.  <br />The book is organized into a few key sections. One details paradigms, new tradition factions and even pan-trandition groups. Another chapter has \\"crunchy\\" stuff, like wonders and new backgrounds.  An interesting thing about the Wonders is their are things called Tradition swords. Each one has a magical ability that makes it a very powerful weapon.  <br />The most noted chapter though is the history chapter.  It is giant! It has information on different time periods and regions.  Most notable is that if they were talking about Vikings they'd give examples of traditions who have people with Viking related paradigms. I'd call this info overload.<br />This book is very good.... but well... it's way to much useless information hiding important things.

The word &quot;to look&quot; is very important.<br />Oddly, I did find a use for the dictionary in a very modern reference though.

I'd write this review in Esperanto, but I don't have the grammer fully down yet.  I'd recommend this book highly though.  For those who stumbled here Esperanto is an international spoken by over 2 million people across the world to help foster internation communication.  The grammer is simple at a level unimaginable, and a determined person could get the whole language under their belt in a year, and that is fluency.  I plan on finishing my study of it this summer.<br />The book itself teaches you key words fast, but not in the right order.  It starts with things for the house, and then the town.  It should really start with greetings.  I hadn't learned the words for hi and goodbye until I'd been in an Esperanto chat, they are &quot;Saluton&quot; and &quot;Gxis Revido&quot;.  <br />The book teaches you numbers straight up, and the sound system which uses accent marks so each letter only has one sound.  The accent marks are usually replaced with an &quot;x&quot; on a computer though. The number system is easy enough, it's like Spanish or maybe German (which I don't know) with the way the number name works except the teen numbers aren't irregular.<br />I'd recommend this book... well to every human alive.  I really think that one non-national language being international would be more efficent then having everyone learn English and Chinese and Arabic and Hindustani.	2002-04-28

When I was in 4th Grade me and my friends used to make up games in our heads but something was lacking a cohesive setting.  By the time I was in 7th Grade we decided to buy an RPG book, just to get the gist of things. We ended up buing Vampire, and I must say it is great!  I've bought 40 other books by White-Wolf in the last few years.<br />This game is a modern game in the Modern World, not a D&amp;D type of Fantasy. Vampires are real in this game, they live in all the major cities, they pull the strings of politics.  They hide from Humanity though, because they fear discovery.  Yet they have to interact with humans, because as Vampires they eternally need blood to survive and even more to power their dark powers.  <br />Vampires are arranged into clans, 13 to be exact all created by Ancient founders. These clans are divided into three groups.  The first is the Camarilla, most obsessed with secrecy and having 7 of the Vampire clans.  The next is the Sabbat, a group of Vampires who believe they should rule humanity and arch-Rivals of the Camarilla.  They only consist of two clans but their are other clan members who have decided to join.  Finally their are 4 Independent clans who try to avoid keeping any alligence to anyone.<br />The Rules of this game are simple as well.  All a person needs is a copy of the sheets, a pencil and maybe ten 10-sided dice. The rule system is rather simple and the game doesn't revolve around pointless hours of combat but story purposes.  This adds more enjoyment to the game, if your interested in weaving a story.<br />The Vampire game is a good introduction to White-Wolf RPG's and it is not only an interesting play, it is an interesting read as well. I have bought many books just to read them, and even if you don't have a group, their is a huge online community.	2002-04-28

It gives a player huge amounts of power right from the start.  This causes players to develop a sort of \\"Must destroy, power is all that matters.\\" The players guide solves this problems and also adds more.  <br />The players guide starts with a bit about how the game is not superfriends.  It continues into information about the world in 2015, the setting has become more sour apparently as apparently Abberants are realized as a threat.  <br />The next Chapters go into Seceret stuff in the Aeon society, and then go into groups like the Deadalus League, who are a group of Abberants who explore space.  The next chapters get into really insane Abberants powers.  They give a three new levels of power, that are so insane.... the cover says it all.  One of the most notable is \\"Universe Creation\\".  That is what it is.  You can assume what it does.  <br />The last chapters seem out of order as they seem to be a continuation of the earlier. It explains certain other Nova groups but hints at Abberant Underworld having some of the information sadly the book hasn't come out yet.<br />This book adds alot to the game of Abberant, and it is very helpful for any player or storyteller who plans on adding some more levels of checks and balances to their game.

The rules are complicated, and so is the setting. It has the highest potential for improvisation and abuse.  Revised clears up many of these rules problems, but limits the story potential greatly.<br />Mage 2nd edition was a Universe spanning game.  The revised edition seems to forget this.  It makes the game very limited, and much less powered.  The Technocracy (basically science wizards) has essentially won the war, and the Masters are trapped deep in the spirit world. This leaves only young mages around to fend for themselves, and teach an upcoming generation of mages the ropes.  This serverely limits Mage in political games, and also in the spirit regions.  The book neglects to mention most of these areas entirely.  Especially the Digital Web.<br />Rule wise, this is all cleaned up. The damage system makes mages more fragile.  Spheres are much better explained, and Paradox is finally something mages can fear!  Gone are the days of shooting fireballs down mainstreet, and not caring about who gets hit. This servely limits power-gamers, but to what end? The story aspect of this game was largely weakend.	2002-03-26

Everyone likes the idea of Assassins, and the snake is the coolest animal to do the job.  They are probubly one of the most complex group of shifters as well.  People believe that they are extinct, but they still conduct their duties.<br />See, the Nagah have the job of playing the judge (the every supernatural group in a White-Wolf game has).  They are basically a group that hunts down offending shapeshifters and plays judge, jury and exicutioner. Of course, due to past circumstances this can only be done by a group of Nagah, and as such they travel in groups of three. <br />Rules wise these guys are monsters.  They have Venom which essentially makes them killers without anything else, as even one bite of the venom, could kill any person who can't soak aggravated damage.  They are also adept at being sneaky and have numerous gifts to hide their passing.  These guys would seem perfect for powergamming but ironically, they are rather limited in fighting purpose.  This book is a rather good book for a person who really wants to spice up their Werewolf game.	2002-03-26

Any player for mage should at least browse through this book. It breaks down the 2nd major mage faction, and proves that at least two of the four sides aren't bad guys. The book infact makes one see the Traditions as the guys without the plan and who are wrong.<br />The first Chapters talk about who the Technocracy is.  They aren't the monolith that the Tradition mages make them seem like.  They are orginized enough to seem like a monolith but they aren't. Neither is the Technocracy people, their are people higher up in the Pyramid who are evil but most people are what would pass as normal people.<br />The next rules chapters are full of all types of treats.  Tons of new backgrounds including Modifications (Cybernetics and Bioengineering), Patron and Requisitions.  These all can lead to story ideas in themselves.  Their are tons of technocratic rotes, that help a person to think of \\"magic\\" as anything but Magic.  Tons of Devices, aka Talismans, are included with a wide variety of uses, and other odd \\"crunchy\\" statistical things.  On the whole this book is very interesting and is almost as essential as the corebook if you want info on the other major faction of mages.	2002-03-26

It caught my attention and kept it though.<br />Despite my preconceptions Hindi is very simple to understand on a basic level, their are no tones, clicks or other oddities.  Their is wide use of nasalized sounds, but anyone who has taken French would not have a problem with it.  The real problem is how colloquial everything is.  Every conversation uses words that a common person would use to speak with their friends.  This isn't a problem at first, but when one looks at the sentence structure they began to wish that things would be easier.  Their is very little info on things that would help a traveller to India in it, and I assume it was written for Americans or English who have Hindi speaking relatives who want to learn.	2002-03-26

To a new person to the genre this may not mean much but Revised has brought some serious changes to the three games that have come out.  Vampire was the first and it was a great improvement to the game.  Mage came second, and lost out.  Their was alot to be expected from it, but it came short in many ways.  Werewolf is middle of the road with most of it's changes being cosmetic.<br />The rules have changed to the revised Story Teller system like Vampire and Mage.  This doesn't make Werewolves weaker or stronger like what happened in Mage or Vampire.  It just makes things easier to do.  Since the damage system changed, it also means that many damage stats are reduced. Some new gifts are created, and Rage, the thing that gives Werewolf players a strong advantage, is toned down.<br />Storywise some changes have happened as well.  The Stargazers, the most enigmatic tribe, in the Western Concordant have left.  It is mysterious why they did, but they claim it is to defend their homelands during the final days.  Speaking of Final Days, this setting really drives that point home, every thing does seem hopeless. I really liked that being added to the setting as it gives the setting a much better feel, mainly so people don't act like Enviornmentalist who can shape change.  This game is a very good introduction to the World of Darkness for beginners, that I'd highly reccomend.	2002-03-26

Teach Yourself remembered this when they printed &quot;Teach Yourself: Hindi script&quot;.  Their is little need to remember words, commiting the letters to memory is enough.  This book is different though, it gives one alot to absorb, like 30 words per unit and grammer.  If a person plans on making inroads to the language though, they must know the letters by heart before doing anything else.  <br />Arabic as an alphabet isn't to hard to remember, but it is quite confusing in spelling, and for a beginner this does not help any when you have words piled on.  It should be noted though the Author does make it so one does understand the language better, I am no expert on Arabic, but I do know alot more then I had thought about knowing.  Although it tries to teach you signs, it ends up building your vocabulary up to inclue quite a few nouns and very few other words.  On the whole though, this book isn't bad though.	2002-03-25

I've bought many Teach Yourself books, but this book makes me want to go through it.  <br />This book isn't built for colloquial speaking in informal formal situations.  It's about being a tourist, but only for the first half of the book.  The writers in this books seem to have decided to make it for people who want to be tourist, and people who want to become close to fluent.  The first few units detail tourist situations like going to the hotel and getting letters. The subjects move to more advanced conversation, but as Swahili isn't that complicated in most respects it isn't bad.<br />The most notable thing that can be noticed about the Swahili language is the use of putting nouns into different classes.  This is likely the most confusing aspect of the language.  This means that they need to be taught very slowly, one noun class per unit... well technically two because the plural counts as a noun class in most cases. The language is easy besides that, with probubly the easiest to understand Verb system, that a three year-old could understand with little effort and a bit of memory. <br />I'd strongly advise this book to anyone who has an interest in understanding an African language (It could be useful one day) or plans on taking a trip to Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, or Even Southern Somalia.	2002-01-20

This book is an excellent into the language of Hindi, I picked this book mainly in the interest of looking at it, and found the writting system was fascinating enough to buy the book.  Once you get past the background chapters about the language the book gets you directly into writting characters, and doing excersises.  In about a week I was able to write all the consants and vowels, and understand basic 'conjuncts', which are probubly the hardest thing about the writting.  Conjuncts are basically two consanants put together.  The next chapters skim the surface of grammer and basic sentences.  The end has 5 appendices giving you writting examples that would make you scratch your head in confusion for awhile, Numbers, Answers and even additional practice.<br />The book is also full of numerous signs that have things written in Hindi in them, these make learning the different fonts much easier and get you out of looking for the English letters in some of them.<br />My one complaint is the way this book doesn't explain the sounds to well, and the writting examples in the end are horrible!  I write bad in english but it seems these people had burned their palms before trying to write.	2002-01-04

The setting takes upa  majority of the space but it also doesn't explain the Spheres like it does in Mage for example- Mage2nd:Life5:Transform complex lifeforms.  Mage:TSC: Life5- Greater Godhand.    Also the game greatly Stresses magic Faith and Science.  The only flaws it has in it relates to them.  Their is a form of Paradox regardless of what people would think but It can help or hinder you.  It is also interesting to have the Technocracy (or Order of Reason) be the ones strugling.   Any Player of white-wolf games should get this it is a must! and has a map of Europe in 1500.	2000-11-12

Most people think of the Spiders as working for the Weaver.  The truth is they work as all parts of the Triat to correct it.  The only confusing thing about them is that their aren't enough rules about how to kill a Spider swarm.  This makes them nearly unstoppable and VERY hard to notice when they sneak up behind you.  To make things even more unbalanced they can eat a persons brain and take over their body!  That really isn't to pretty.  All in all this book was well written stressing RPing over Rules.	2000-10-09
