Willard's book most certainly covers all the topics that \\"every young analyst should know\\", as Kelley wrote, but I think this book outdoes Kelley's when it comes to that! It covers topics like convergence, separation & countability, compactness, connectedness, uniform spaces & a short discussion on function spaces & C* algebras at the end. Many of the theorems, proofs & examples come directly from the original source articles, or are the most general versions there is. Each section has a very detailed & interesting historical discussion at the end of the book where the author lists the original articles & the circumstances in which they were published & other stuff. Where the text really stands out though is the problem sets. As the reader goes deeper into the book of course the concepts get more complicated & proofs of extremely deep & important results are outlined as problems. These are things such as the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, Hahn-Banach theorem, Pontryagin duality theorem, stuff about realcompactness, Edwin Hewitt's construction of a regular T1 space in which every continuous function is constant(!) & many more. Don't be afraid though; the discussion in the text, hints given & notes in the back help with proving things like those. Many of the examples are also highly nontrivial & therefore very helpful (imho). To sum up, I believe this book is very underrated & deserves the recognition of the texts by Munkres & Kelley.	2005-07-29

This book says what many many other say, basically that a girl should play hard to get, to make the guy wait, etc etc. I think where all those books go wrong is to assume that there is pretty much only one type of girl, one type of guy, and one type of relationship. Argov means well, because all the recommendations in the book will work, and she's right to say girls shouldn't let their guard down too soon. After having read this, though, I can spot a \\"bitch\\" girl a mile away. I'd just prefer that a girl be straight-up rather than play some stupid transparent game, as if I don't notice what's going on. Another problem one will notice if one reads serious books on relationships is how the verbal messages don't coincide with the girls' nonverbal behaviour, which causes problems all the time in relationships. If people want to really learn about relationships & communication they should take a course on those topics, like I (a sensitive guy) did or study some serious books on them by authors such as Sharon Brehm, Mark Knapp, Ronald Adler, etc. Books like \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" are roughly the equivalent of getting relationship advice from television, so you can expect similar results I think. Another problem I have with these sort of books is that they're written on the assumption that all \\"nice\\" girls are roughly the same, the guys are roughly the same and the same formula can be used on all guys, with the same result. (obviously the real world doesn't work this way)	2005-02-26
US	50825098	R3UL2G9KLVGEUQ	1567513069	607099070	Freeing the World to Death: Essays on the American Empire	Books	4	38	40	N	N	again, not Blum's piece de resistance	... but that's OK; I don't think he intended this to be another book on the scale of Killing Hope. Killing Hope is all about the US military & CIA interventions since WWII; Rogue State is about all the (highly) illegal & immoral stuff the US has been deeply involved in (torture, looting/kidnapping, etc). Freeing the World to Death, however doesn't seem to have as much of a focus, it's more like miscellaneous Bill Blum stuff. (I guess that's to be expected given the subtitle). The introduction has one of my favourite quotations:  <br /> <br />\\"We can say the United States runs the world like the Taliban ran Afghanistan. Cuba is dealth with like a woman caught outside not wearing her burkha. Horrific sanctions are imposed on Iraq in the manner of banning music, dancing and kite-flying in Kabul. Jean-Bertrand Aristide is banished from Haiti like religious police whipping a man whose beard is not the right length.\\"  <br /> <br />The rest of the introduction explains that what the Bush admin does in the world has been done to death by virtually every president for a long time (100yrs+), but it's only now that people want to do something about it. After that the book is split into four parts: one containing the Anti-Empire Reports from the author's website, [...] the second is about US interventions, the third is about the Cold War & the last is about US domestic policy. I would say the highlights from the US interventions part is the transcript of a speech he gave on why terrorists keep picking on the United States (it's not because they \\"hate freedom\\") and the author's presentation & commentary on a debate on US foreign policy at Trinity College, Dublin. Part III (the Cold War) starts with commentary on anti-Communism with samples of American anti-Communst propaganda (which sound hilarious now). The highlight would have to be the chapter on the US bombing of Hiroshima & Nagasaki. It has been said that the bombing of those two cities wasn't the final shot of WWII, but the first shot of the Cold War. (see the book for more details ;) ) The last part is about \\"the Empire at Home\\" including email correspondence with some of his critics, Cuban political prisoners (in the US), John Kerry, & some articles of the author's in London's Ecologist, including a review of Greg Palast's The Best Democracy Money Can Buy. This book isn't as heavily footnoted as Killing Hope or Rogue State, partly because some chapters are transcripts of talks he has given, or they are newspaper/magazine articles. If you're a fan of Blum (like me), I think this book is a good buy, but if not, I would say that his other two books would be better for non-fans since they have more of a focus and it's easier to find out where Blum found something out.	2005-01-28

You can find out the following things: <br />-- excerpts from training manuals with titles like \\"A Study of Assassination\\", \\"Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual\\", \\"Psycological Operations in Guerilla Warfare (p.43) <br />-- a list of assassination attempts on foreign leaders (p.38) <br />-- chapters on depleted uranium & cluster bombs <br />-- the US government used/tested chemical/biological weapons in: the Bahamas, Canada (can't forgive my government for allowing that...), China & Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Panama, Cuba (p.103) <br />-- the US government tested chemical/biological weapons on its own people in Watertown (NY), San Francisco, Minneapolis, St Louis, Washington DC, Florida, Savannah, Avon Park, NYC, Chicago as well as deliberate releases of radioactive material (p.113) <br />-- the US government encouraged the use of chemical or biological weapons by other nations (p.120) <br />-- a list of countries that have used torture, with handbooks, encouragement, etc provided by the CIA (p.50) <br />-- the US government has been 'spying' on the rest of the world via the super-secret Echelon system & other stuff (p.200) <br />-- during Operation Desert Storm the Iraqi Kurds got hold of 18 tons of Iraqi government documents which are now on public display at the U of Colorado @ Boulder (p.213) <br />-- similarily, after the Berlin Wall came down, the CIA got hold of the top-secret archives of the Stasi, East Germany's intelligence agency, and refused to return it for 9 years. Clinton wouldn't even discuss it with Schroeder. (p.212) <br />-- a list of CIA narcotrafficking operations, when they worked with the mafia, organised crime, etc (p.218) <br /> <br />and so on... Pretty much all of Blum's footntes include mainstream media, academic journals, official government documents (declassified or public), and so on. None of this looks like paranoid \\"conspiracy\\" stuff when you lookat where he finds out these things that he says. This book is the perfect antidote for people who are tired of the same-old \\"mainstream\\" stuff we see on TV, or who are wondering if, say, the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal is an exception to the rule or is just another typical incident. It's not Blum's 'piece de resistance' (Killing Hope) but it's still pretty good.	2005-01-15

Interventions Since World War II--Updated Through 2003	Books	5	40	46	N	N	definitive	This has got to be the definitive book on US foreign policy since WWII. Blum goes through how the CIA has been involved in drug trafficking, producing pornography, providing handbooks, materials & encouragement for torture, how the military did chemical & biological tests on the general public, etc. It's all written in a ridiculous amount of detail, mainly citing sources that use internal government documents, or the writings of people in the 3rd world who got bombed nonstop. & yes, at times the author uses sarcasm & black humor, which greatly helps with readability, since the reading could easily become very heavy without it.    Here's my favourite quotation, from the end of the Vietnam chapter:   \\"The West has never been allowed to forget the Nazi holocaust. For 55 years there has been a continuous outpouring of histories, memoirs, novels, feature films, documentaries, television series... played and replayed in every Western language; there have been museaums, memorial sculptures, photo expositions, remembrance ceremonies... Never Again! But who hears the voice of the Vietnamese peasant? Who has access to the writings of the Vietnamese intellectual? What was the fate of the Vietnamese Anne Frank? Where, asks the young American, is Vietnam?\\" (p.133)    & another, re: Operation Desert Storm: \\"Tanks pulling plows moved alongside trenches, firing into the Iraqi soldiers inside the trenches as the plows covered them with great mounds of sand. Thousands were buried dead, wounded, or alive.\\" (p.334)  I had read about that elsewhere but wondered if it were actually true. The sources are the LA Times and Washington Post. It occurred on Feb 24-25, 1991.     Anyway the whole book is jam-packed with such quotations. Every chapter is really like a book within a book there is so much information.	2004-06-24

There are articles on pretty much everything there is in university like the actual buildings on campus, along with how the classrooms and desks/tables are organised, how racism and sexism are perpetuated in society because of how schools are tacitly non-inclusive, to actual indoctrination and 'obedience training' in law and business schools. I go to a public university in Canada, and while I don't think the hidden curriculum is as obvious or extreme here as these American sociologists say since they only looked at American schools, the situation would probably be roughly the same across the Western world. This book breaks new ground in that hidden curriculum hadn't been studied in-depth before; it has only been highschools and elementary schools that have been studied before. It was good to have some of my suspicions confirmed by others by reading this book. I think it's good that it's acceptable to talk about this sort of thing openly, society has progressed far enough that we can do that I guess.	2004-05-28

It's got a chapter on each of the following things: triangles (with Ceva's & Steiner-Lehmus' theorems, orthic triangles & Euler lines, etc), circles (like power of a point, etc), collinearity & concurrence, transformations (Yaglom's series of 3 books are better for these though but this is a good introduction), and an intro to inversive geometry and projective geometry. One section that blew my mind is the one about the \\"3-jugs\\" problem where you've got a jug that holds 8L, one that holds 5L & one the holds 3L and the goal is to get 4L in each of two jugs. Maybe you've heard of it...? This book gives a general method for solving problems like that using reflections. I liked how each section is very short and typically has just 2-3 theorems, so the book is split into manageable pieces. Maybe it's just a psychological thing, but I like that. Depending on the section, there are 3-10 problems at the end of each section; like any book there are easy ones with fairly obvious solutions and there are hard ounes that take a lot of thought. I think the hard ones might have come from olympiads because Sam Greitzer was a USAMO coach at some point. It doesn't matter though, this book gives you a lot of tools you can use to deal with olympiad-level problems. A couple good ones to work on after this book would be Johnson's \\"Advanced Euclidean Geometry\\" and Court's \\"College Geometry\\", both out of print unfortunately but maybe a nearby library wold have them?	2004-05-28

To paraphrase Chandrasekhar's review of Watson's Bessel functions text, this is &quot;a veritable mine of information... indispensable to those who have occasion to use point-set topology.&quot; I don't think this book is intended to be a text (&amp; I think the authors say so), in which case it would be terrible because it doesn't explain the concepts very much. It's mostly a catalogue of every kind of set you can come up with, every kind of topology you can put on it, and what properties it has such as what T_i axioms the space satisfies, whether it's compact, para compact, etc etc. Most of the time such things are proven, but be prepared to think hard sometimes about the proofs or fill in details. I'm the kind of student where I have trouble understanding things which are highly 'counter-intuitive' so I had trouble proving things, even when I knew definitions, when I did topology for the first time last term. Once I saw this book though I got used to all the weird things in topology (like the ordered square, R in the lower-limit topology, Sorgenfrey plane, etc etc). This book is incredibly useful as a reference.	2004-05-28

That is, we should be able to do what is now technologically feasible, which is to have networks of people with common interests who can communicate  with each other (through mail, email, etc) and decide when/where they will meet to discuss something. An example he gives is a guitar teacher posting their contact information &amp; availability somewhere, and someone interested in learning to play the guitar contacting them. Simple as that, and it would be a similar situation with anything. I think something like that could happen in a school environment, which is where I don't really agree with Illich, but the system would have to be changed radically for it to be possible. I don't think it would matter whether schools 'stay' in society but with a totally different system where students are encouraged to question everything &amp; do what they're comfortable with, or done away with altogether though. Such an education situation wouldn't last long in a society based on authoritarian hierarchic institutions.	2004-05-28

He then goes on to tell us how, since the Mulroney government abolished the Foreign Investment Review Agency in 1985, approximately 13000 Canadian businesses have been taken over, mostly by Americans. He also says why this is bad due to transfer pricing &amp; other things. Then he goes on to say why it would be a bad thing to continue the &quot;Americanisation&quot; of Canada and gives us some differences between Canada &amp; the United States, including why Canada is better in many ways than the United States. Near the end, he lists many alternatives to the current situation, including 4 things which MUST happen for Canada to survive in any meaningful way. Is it too late to save Canada? I think it's a question of political will. Canada isn't Haiti; it has more to do with will than opportunity.	2004-05-01

I wouldn't say that this book is good for someone who has never seen algebra before because the easy problems are still kind of hard compared with other books.

There's just enough stuff in this book to fill up a 1-term course, but no more so you'll have to get another book to find more applications, or other stuff to look at. The texts by Hoffman/Kunze or Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces by Halmos are good references. As for this Axler book, I like how it's written in a relatively informal style, including comments in the margins by the author. I also like how he emphasizes the concepts of vector spaces, inner product spaces, etc rather than matrices (although they do appear but they're not emphasized) while determinants are done last. This is the only book I know of that does it this way &amp; I think I liked it better like that.	2004-04-30

It isn't very often though, the rest of the book is pretty good, and I was a bit surprised because I had only heard of the well-known authors like Gallian, Herstein, Lang, etc. It covers maybe 3 courses worth of material too, including groups, rings, fields, vector spaces &amp; modules, Galois Theory (complete with every possible application!), and more advanced stuff like a separate chapter on modules (in addition to the section with vector spaces), tensor products and principal ideal domains. There are also complete solutions to the odd-numbered problems. This book is surprisingly good except in certain parts, I like it.	2004-04-13

This is modern Galois Theory, straight from the horse's mouth! Galois Theory is taught today using field extensions rather than by actually solving polynomials, students also learn to view a field extension as a vector space over the smaller field; both of these things were pioneered by Artin.

There are enough examples &amp; lots &amp; lots of problems ranging from simple computations to actual proofs (like that e is irrational, for example). The explanation is fairly clear also. Off the top of my head, topics for 1st year in this book include functions, continuity, limits, derivatives, applications of the derivative (lots of word problems), Riemann integration, applications of integration (like separable ODEs, volumes), techniques of integration (partial fractions, parts, trig substitution, etc). The stuff I did in 2nd year was vectors, differential geometry, partial derivatives, spherical &amp; cylindrical coordinates, applications of partial derivatives &amp; multiple integrals, line &amp; surface integrals.I didn't think this book was as bad as the other reviewers.

The proofs and examples in the text are really good guides to doing the problems also. In some sections there are counterexamples for, say, the converse of a theorem which are always really pathological. At the beginning of each section there is some discussion on what to expect, why the stuff is important, what to do with it, etc. Even though I had a really good prof for the topology course I did this book was very helpful out of the classroom.	2004-04-12

I agree with the person who said this book is very informative &amp; it is also easy to read. I learned lots from doing the problems too, like for example, a simple algorithm on how to construct magic squares of odd size. This book was good for the course I did because there's only so much you can do in a course; Morris Kline's &quot;Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times&quot; is twice as long as this one so it goes into much more detail, but too much for a 1-term course.

This book would be helpful for anyone in high school or 4th-year abstract algebra, or anywhere in between! There's hardly any text to read, I would say ~85% of the learning is done by solving the problems. Barbeau guides the reader by giving directions on how to solve them sometimes, so learning from this book is MUCH MORE interactive (I think that's the right word...) than with others where you just read. It covers complex numbers, how to solve quadratics, cubics &amp; quartics by radicals, symmetric functions of the roots, some number theory (like congruences), numerical methods &amp; approximating roots, factors &amp; zeros and symmetric functions of the roots.

It's got everything you need to get through multivariable calculus course and/or vector calculus & Fourier Series. It doesn't really go into any analysis stuff though; it's all concrete, so you can look at this to get the 'rough & ready' versions of theorems/proofs & then find the more rigorous & abstract versions somewhere else, or later on in your studies. It's also a good reference since it covers a lot more than what you might do in a course, & could be helpful for more than one course. It has so many solved problems & theorems that might not be done elsewhere. Get this if you're in maybe 2nd-year math & are going to carry on in math, science or engineering.	2004-04-12

This book gives a very concrete intro to Galois theory & field theory & would be an excellent supplement to an advanced course on algebra. It has some group theory in it but its emphasis is on field theory because its focus is ONLY on Galois theory & its applications, so you'll have to find another book on general abstract algebra. But for Galois theory this text really helped me out with its fairly concrete treatment. Look at this to get a more tangible version of more abstract stuff. Each chapter has a bibiolgraphy at the end of it & each one is a goldmine for interesting stuff about abstract algebra, history, numbers, etc.(...) One could also think of this book as a jumping-off point to all kinds of other stuff it scratches the surface of.	2004-04-12
US	50825098	R2B8KGCR62I0EB	0130652652	464967268	Advanced Calculus	Books	3	2	5	N	N	not too good...	I can't really think of good things to say about this book... There aren't enough problems &amp; definitely not enough examples (like 1 or 2 in each section). The explanation is ok but more examples would have made this book much more helpful. This book is pretty average. I don't know if the Schaum's Advanced Calculus book is the best, but it's better than this one.	2004-04-12

Dudley's writing style is very informal &amp; I thought it was a nice change from other books. Like the other person said, the book is clearly written and there are lots of examples. I had this book for a 3rd-year course, but I think a 1st or 2nd-year student could handle this book.	2004-04-12

This book may be better for a physics or engineering student for that reason, and the rigour can come later if you're in math. I had this text for an intro PDEs course that had many students from physics or engineering, so I totally believe that this is the right book for them. Maybe if math students want more rigour they could learn the proofs of everything. This book is a pretty good 1-stop text for everything you'd want to do in undergrad PDEs. There are enough examples and problems to make things clear. It's definitely a keeper if you're going to carry on with PDEs.	2004-04-12
US	50825098	RE75D2U405NAF	0486425436	891737765	The Skeleton Key of Mathematics: A Simple Account of Complex Algebraic Theories (Dover Books on Mathematics)	Books	5	26	26	N	N	very helpful	I used the chapter on Galois Theory as a reference for a course I was in because it had such a concrete explanation on how Galois Theory works. However, it didn't mention anything about field extensions &amp; barely mentioned groups. That's why I liked this book, it gives concrete versions of things like (off the top of my head) complex variables, matrices, Galois Theory, polynomials, tensors &amp; more. There's a chapter on each subject &amp; treats it in a very concrete manner. Any math student not totally comfortable with abstractness (as I was, with Galois Theory of equations anyway) would find this book helpful, imo.	2004-04-12
US	50825098	R2ZMQA2T29UWU7	0387900934	419585246	Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)	Books	4	14	16	N	N	overrated, but still good	This book is a good reference, because it contains a lot more material than is contained in most courses, but I don't think I'd want to use it for an intro to linear algebra. It's got stuff that other books don't have, like Hilbert spaces &amp; some analysis stuff in an appendix, tensor products, multilinear forms... It's good as a reference or supplement, but not as a main text, IMO. For an intro, I liked Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right or the Hoffman/Kunze book.	2004-04-10
US	50825098	R3LILBUNX9ZHF3	0079121462	914015238	Complex Variables and Applications : Macintosh (Churchill-Brown Series)	Books	5	4	5	N	N	excellent! (as an intro)	This book would be really good for a physics or engineering student, or for a math student as an intro since it isn't as theoretical as other books. Everything is explained very clearly, with lots of examples but still with some hard/interesting problems also. The first 7 chapters cover all the theory, which is the usual stuff like complex numbers, differentiability &amp; Cauchy-Riemann equations, integration &amp; Cauchy integral forumla/theorem, series, Taylor series, Laurent series, residues, poles, solving real integrals with residues, etc etc. Chapters 8-12 cover applications which I admit I don't know a lot about, but if the 1st half of the book is any indication, they are good also. The text covers everything in a CONCRETE way, as opposed to an abstract way using concepts from topology like connectedness, compactness, open/closed sets, star-shaped sets, etc. For that stuff I used GJO Jameson's Complex Functions text &amp; I also like the one by Ahlfors &amp; the one by Jerrold Marsden. I think every scientist or engineer would find this Brown/Churchill book very helpful. :-)	2004-04-07
US	50825098	R35O895ROQXI8N	0471010901	73447426	Topics in Algebra, 2nd Edition	Books	4	10	12	N	N	very good but not 100% complete	I had this text for a 4th-year course in Galois theory &amp; (somewhat) advanced group theory, like normalisers, Sylow's Theorems, conjugacy &amp; finite abelian groups. I would say that I liked the presentation and writing style in this book but I didn't think it was totally complete. There was just a section on solvability by radicals, and no other applications of Galois theory like trisecting angles, duplicating cubes, etc. Then again, it IS a topics book so it wouldn't go into something in great detail. The presentation is good, there are tons of really good problems (like baby Herstein), but the chapter on field theory is a weak point, IMO. So 4 stars, even though I hate to do it because the rest of the book is much better.	2004-04-07
US	50825098	R2SMV36XE0I5I1	0486421740	348924846	Foundations of Mathematical Analysis	Books	5	57	59	N	N	Very good	Everybody seems to think that Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis is the best for whatever reason, & I agree that it's good for reference after being exposed to the material. Pfaffenberger doesn't construct the real numbers using Dedekind cuts, he makes a list of 13 axioms that basically say that the reals is the only complete ordered field. I think I liked this approach better than Rudin's (or Hardy's) more abstract approach. He also spends much more time developing metric spaces (including the Baire Category Theorem & nowhere dense sets, etc, which Rudin omits except for a couple exercises) and the Riemann-Stieltjes Integral. Then there's a short chapter where transcendental functions exp, sin & cos are defined which I think Rudin skips, and then introduction to inner-product spaces. Fourier series is introduced in the chapter on general inner-iroduct spaces (with a first look at Banach Spaces as an aside) rather than the chapter on sequences & series of functions. I also liked this better than Rudin's text or other calculus texts. Rudin includes a whole chapter on functions of several variables, but Pfaffenberger doesn't have anything on them. Instead, there's a chapter on normed linear spaces and the Riesz Representation Theorem, and then similar to Rudin, a chapter on the Lesbesgue Integral. This book has many more problems than Rudin's or Apostol's, and in general they are a bit easier. Of course every section has its difficult ones but the first ones are almost always just \\"verify that blah blah is true\\". The last ones are about on the same level as the ones in Rudin's book.	2004-03-13
