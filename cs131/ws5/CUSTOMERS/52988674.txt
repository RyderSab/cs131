What I would have given for this book then!<br />Having read a number of ATM books now, I can say that this is one of the better ones.  The writing is relatively clear, and it moves quickly from topic to topic.  In addition to the 560+ pages of core text, the book has hundreds of pages of lab exercises and with detailed solutions, and a thick glossary.<br />On the whole this book isn't so golden that I would rank it among the crown jewels of Cisco Press (i.e. the Routing TCP/IP series) but it is a solid book, and covers precisely what the title suggests that it does.  If you had to read just ONE book on ATM, you could do worse than to pick this one.	2002-06-18

These books are rich in low level technical details, but the choice of which details to include and which to leave out frequently seems arbitrary and rarely contributes to easy reading.<br />I'd recommend these books as a desk reference for the networking professional who isn't content to download .pdf standards and white papers from the ITU-T &amp; the ATM Forum.  Reading the series from start to finish is an unpleasant experience, but not unbearable.<br />For the reader looking for an eloquent introduction to ATM, how it works, and what it can do, this is NOT the place to start.  Keep looking.	2002-06-09

The poor writing style that characterises these books is less noticable here, with topics recieving terse yet good treatment.  The inclusion of low level technical details seems less random and more to the point.  The diagrams and illustrations that had previously been one of the few flawless aspects of the series show weak editing here, with typoes and mislabling on a notable fraction of them, but on the whole, the text communicates its information to the student well regardless.<br />Having come to the end of this trilogy, I would have to recommend that the student of ATM look elsewhere before this series for information on the topic.  While Black's books may have been the best resource available at the time they were published, the choices are not so slim now.  Black deserves to be lauded for his early digestion of white papers and standards into this series.  Still - a month more to polish the writing would have given the books a lasting appeal that they presently lack.	2002-06-09

In truth, while there is little order or sense to the content of this book, it does contain useful information, and is not wholely indecipherable.  Having worked with ATM during the period when forum White Papers were nearly the only real informational resource available, this book does represent a step foward in that it forms a viable shortening of the information load needed to comprehend ATM networking.  While I cannot regard it as a masterfully crafted book, it has its place in my library.  Better to read this tome to begin with than to attempt to face that tower of White Papers without guide again.	2002-06-05

The diagrams are clear, and the writing unmarred by grammatical errors.  Nonetheless, the challenge this book poses the reader is not entirely in the difficulty of the topic, but also can be blamed on the carelessness of the author.  While the book forms a valuable shortening of the topics needed to comprehend ATM when compared to the White Papers, one longs for a more graceful explanation than U. Black offers.	2002-06-05

Never before has a Cisco book covered so many protocols so poorly in so little space.  I actually felt more confused about IS-IS after reading this book than I did before I started.  The coverage of other protocols is little better.  The author's frequent grammatical slip-ups render many sentances open to contracdictory interpretations.  On the whole, I would recommend the CCIE Routing TCP/IP Volumes I and II before this book.  There are some good chapters here and there in the book, and some good information you won't find elsewhere, but the middle chunk of the text is a waste.  So much of this book is a bad rehash of what the CCNP or CCIE candidate will have already studied elsewhere as to make the reading experience as a whole discouraging.	2002-05-04

This book can essentially be divided into two parts:<BR>1) Why you should address your network Like So.<BR>2) Issues &amp; Tips with individual routing protocols.<br />  Part 1 is written a relatively clear and concise fashion, and makes a good follow up or addition to a CCDP course of study.  Part 2 is slightly rich with errors, and a bit more grab-bag like in its approach to the subject matter.  Weighing in at around 250 pages of core material, this book is one of the lighter reads in the CCIE study course, and could be tackled by a less experienced candidate as well.  On the whole a good book, but not a great one, I still consider it recommendable.	2002-04-09

The chapters on SNA fill out a CCDP requirement that's hard to research elsewhere.  The Voice over Data networking chapter is a nice summary, too.  Otherwise, the writing of this book poorly rehashes what you should already know from the previous 5 exams you had to take before this one.

I've come to be fairly accepting of occassional flaws in Cisco Press books.  Given the pace of the technology they must describe, its to be expected that their editing cycles can't be full and perfect.  Still, this book sinks to new lows for coherence and writing quality.  Stylistically, this text resembles little more than a jumble of power point documents pasted into book format.  Numerous charts, bulleted lists, and diagrams are thrown together with a simulacrum of connecting text.  The author's train of thought derails frequently, and copious space is wasted restating section headings.  Near entire pages appear to have been cut and paste from other sections of the text (e.g. pages 29 and 30), and repetition is seen throughout.<br />The best that can be said for this book is that it is easy to read the author's intentions from the flawed writing style, and extract the course notes that the text has been distilled from by deductive reasoning.	2001-09-07

The problem is, the writing style makes it impossible to read this book from cover to cover if you don't already know everything in it.  If ever an IT book was screaming for a glossary, this was the one.  The author habitually uses terms and acronyms as if the reader already knew them, and then goes on to define them chapters later.  At least on one occassion, I found a term used in chapter 2 defined in chapter 3.  The definition of the term used another that wasn't defined until chapter 5.  As said, there's no glossary, and the index is entirely too sparse to cover for that omission.   Reading this book WILL teach you well, but don't sit down with it without a reference library and/or net connection handy to look up the terms that you can't find any other way.	2001-06-27

What this book doesn't tell you, it will tell you where to look up.  Within each chapter are at least 3 recommendations of other books that you &quot;must read.&quot;  Overall, the book itself is quite good, too.  It's an excellent coder's eye view of how RTS games are and should be turned out, in the here and now.  It's obviously strongly influenced by what has already been done with the genre, and takes a narrow view of what that genre is.  The author is prone to throwing out declarations of How Things Should Be Done that are sometimes questionable, but it's clear that he has such strong opinions because he's been programming on the front lines for that long, and has seen way, way more than most of what can go wrong.  Follow the plan in this book and you will end up with the framework of a respectable starcraft/aoe clone.  Creativity must be left up to the reader.	2000-11-28

I'd never read a book that started with a bang quite like this one, with the hero of the novel caught in a lethal blast on page one.  The story continues foward from there.  This is one of the seminal works of the cyberpunk movement; you can be rebuilt more handsome and more dysfunctional.<br />Like the protagonist, the book's perspecive is shattered here, whirling away in fragmentary views of the action that follows from a handful of different characters who know nothing of each other until they all fall into place at the end and all, or most, is made clear.  It's a literary style that Gibson uses for every work after this one, but never with quite the same perfection as this first time.<br />It's hard to not see this work in the shadow of Neuromancer.  It's also tempting to see it in the light of the Star Wars Trilogy. (Yes, of course I'm talking about the original trilogy.) If Neuromancer is the captivating first work that could have started a genre all by itself, and Mona Lisa Overdrive is the somewhat dissappointing finale that you love anyway for the series it was in, then Count Zero is the edgy piece in the middle.  It's the one that's brimming with the promise of everything that came before and after, and in the end, rewards rereading again, and again.<br />Am i making sense here?  No?  Well, perhaps you should read the book and decide for yourself then...	2000-11-28

While friend Bill Gibson was turning out cyberpunk parables of the human condition, Sterling produced this reflecting jewel.  This is a story that uses the same alchemy as its Hard SciFi predecessors, wherein technology is the lense by which we are shown the nature of those create, shape, and use it.<br />This is an epic tale, spanning centuries.  Over its scope first contact with aliens is made, and humanity becomes an alien thing itself.  Overshadowing all is a rivalry that drives the politics of each passing age blindly, madly ahead, in the classical tragic mode.<br />The story is, at its finale, a transcendent one, offering not answers to its readers, but only a place to watch from.<br />P.S. If you like this sort of thing, where technology and the human spirit reflect each other, I can only recommend &quot;Holy Fire&quot; (also by Sterling) and &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot; most highly.	2000-11-28

GURPS is one of the finest role playing systems i have yet used.  It wins my selection as best roleplaying system for low-fantasy, historic, and modern genre stories.  GURPS lets a player design a character that really resembles what they want.  The core rules elegantly describe most things a person would think to do.  An excelent balance is struck between realism and simplicity. On the downside, GURPS begins to break down when humanity is not the norm within the stories you wish to tell.  In the copious library of GURPs suppliments, designers seem to have wildly different ideas of how to deal with super-human and alien abilities in a character.  For such settings, Champions/the Hero System often works better, in my experiece.  GURPs, by virtue of its richly detailed character creation system, is also a poor choice of systems for genres where Life Is Cheap.  Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu and R.Talsorian's Cyberpunk 2020 pull off that genre element with much more panache.	2000-11-25
