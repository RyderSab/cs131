Everyone seems to have a diagnosis as well as a prescription for our reputed moral decline. However, new books by political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset and by legal scholar Ronald Dworkin go beyond merely expounding a set of predetermined conclusions or recommendations and provide readers with analytic tools for use in the assessment of American political culture.    Lipset's title gives a reliable indication of the central thesis of this work, which proceeds in continuity, with a well-developed body of social science literature to which Lipset himself has been a major contributor. The United States is different from other countries because it is founded upon a national creed rather than upon the social bonds of ethnicity and history that normally cement peoples together. Our national sense of self is derived from a broadly shared ideology which includes commitment to liberty, equality, populism, individualism, and antistatism. This consensus does not, of course, eliminate all conflict, but it does constrict considerably the range of mainstream opinion to one or another form of liberalism (in the classical sense of the word). From these same cultural roots stem both faces of U.S. distinctiveness: the laudable (voluntarism, individual initiative, personal responsibility) and lamentable (self-serving behavior, atomism, disregard for the common good).     Lipset takes seriously the adage: \\"to know only one culture is to know none.\\" Group traits are best highlighted by observing patterns of variation and contrast. This insight serves as an organizing principle of his book, which includes chapters comparing the political culture of the United States with that of our closest kin, Canada, and of our fellow misfit (or \\"outlier\\" in terms of social indicators) inthe international community, Japan. Lipset's analysis of distinctive U.S. social, political, economic, and historical factors succinctly recapitulates the classic debate (started by Marx and Engels) over the surprising underdevelopment of class consciousness and socialist movements in the United States. Lipset joins such commentators as Louis Hartz, Richard Hofstadter, and Michael Harrington in seeing Americanism (the ideology of success that posits the existence of unrestricted opportunity) as, in effect, a substitute for socialism in the U.S. context. This phenomenon renders the American experience qualitatively different from the consciousness of limited opportunity and political power that prevails in other industrialized societies.    Lipset's use of contrast is not limited to cross-national comparison. Nearly half the book is devoted to \\"exceptions to exceptionalism,\\" social groups within American society which have undergone experiences at variance from the national mainstream. Lipset chooses three: American Jews (who are notable for how their unusual material success remains coupled with an abiding commitment to social equality), African-Americans (whose marginalization is linked to a greater openness to such group-oriented solutions as affirmative action), and intellectuals (who are more likely to embrace leftist approaches because of their alienation from market-driven populist society). In all three cases, deviation from the U.S. norm sheds much useful light on the inner logic of the distinctive American ideology. Lipset's portrayals allow the reader a revealing glimpse of why our polity is capable of engaging simultaneously in noble attempts to institutionalize virtue or to impose an often intolerant, crusading moralism while we hold fast to a construal of meritocracy which fosters a ruthless instrumental pursuit of material success that is largely indifferent to social decay.    `'America a unique blend of good, bad and ugly'' The Toronto Star, July 6,1996, Pg. J15    Canadians are fated to share the territory between the Rio Grande and the North Pole with the United States - a nation, as George Grant put it, that has no history of its own before the age of progress and which has become the dynamic centre of technological modernity. What sort of a people are these, whose destiny we share whether we like it or not?    Seymour Martin Lipset is the distinguished author of more than 20 books of sociology and political science. Even more unusual for an American, he has a deep and enduring interest in Canada. Continental Divide (1989) is still the best comparative study of Canadian and American institutions and values.     Comparison is the key to Lipset's approach since, as he says, to know only one country is to know none. The great observers of the American scene were like Alexis de Tocqueville who, when he wrote his masterpiece, Democracy In America, really wanted to know what made America different from his native France.    Lipset shares the view of de Tocqueville and others that the United States is unique among nations. He calls it an \\"outlier,\\" and by this he means that on scales measuring such social indicators as disparities of wealth and property, crime rate, the number of lawyers, church attendance, the USA is found at one extreme or the other.    Nowhere is this more clear than in America's treatment of race. On the one hand, the USA has treated Jews with extraordinary generosity from the beginning of its history. Although Jews make up a small proportion of the population, their religion has been respected from the time of the American Revolution.    However, at the same time as it was showing religious tolerance, it was oppressing and marginalizing its African-Americans.    One important consequence of American treatment of blacks has been the creation among blacks of a set of group-related values: They see themselves as part of a group and demand group rights, whereas whites are more strongly committedto individual rights.    However, as Lipset points out, affirmative action programs were introduced by Republicans, under Richard Nixon no less; they were opposed by black leaders at the time who feared that they would divide the black and white working classes, as indeed they have. This difference of attitude sets blacks and whites at odds.    Perhaps the most significant aspect of the United States that Lipset identifies is its moralism.    In Lipset's words, \\"Americans are utopian moralists who press hard to institutionalize virtue, to destroy evil people and eliminate wicked institutions and practices.\\"    Domestically, Americans often hold their politicians and political institutions in undeserved contempt. Because they think that government is so prone to corruption, they believe it is better to limit the power of the state. Consequently, the American state is the least intrusive in the developed world, but it is also the one that does the least for the elderly, the poor and the sick.    Another important element of the American creed is the belief in the individual and his or her ability to get ahead by their own initiative and efforts. Lipset argues that this trait is so strong, it even explains America's exceptionalism with respect to crime. Success seen in terms of wealth is such a fundamental value for Americans that they subordinate everything to it.    In foreign policy, American moralism has meant that their enemy of the moment - whether King George, Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein or some minor Somali warlord - has to be seen as the devil incarnate. The Vietnam war, Lipset argues, was unpopular, because Lyndon Johnson was unwilling sufficiently to vilify North Vietnamese communists, frightened of stirring up another wave of McCarthyite intolerance.    Another important theme that Lipset addresses is the question of American decline. Many analysts have sought to explain why America had ceased to be economically competitive; they tend to either blame Japan or urge that America become more like Japan.    Lipset makes a convincing case that America has shaken off its rivals, and has restored its position as the world's dominant economy. However, he is fascinated by the differences between Japan and the USA. Japan, he argues, is another outlier, and he devotes a fascinating chapter comparing American exceptionalism with Japanese uniqueness.    Lipset's thesis is provocative but by no means totally convincing. Too often the reader feels that he has chosen only those statistics that support his argument.    Even with these limitations, this book overflows with brilliant insights. Few people will agree with everything in it, but no one will close it without having learned something about our exceptionally annoying but also exceptionally interesting neighbor.    Battles between God and the devil;   The Times Higher Education Supplement July 5, 1996, Pg.23    In the late 1930s and early 1940s there appeared a remarkable group of young Jewish intellectuals in New York City. Gathered around the various alcoves in the cafeteria of the City College of New York, these students battled over the various doctrines that separated the pro-Stalinist Left, the Trotskyists, and Norman Thomas socialists. From among those ranks emerged men whose impact on modern American political thought would be formidable; it was there that the likes of Irving Howe, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, Irving Kristol and the late Martin Diamond earned their stripes.     Over time, a number of those left-wingers became, to one degree or another, leading conservative thinkers. Diamond nearly single-handedly established the study of the political thought of the American founders as a serious object of concern for political scientists and policy makers as well as historians. Glazer eventually joined Kristol as co-editor of The Public Interest; and Kristol went on to found The National Interest as well as Basic Books	2005-10-11

While Lipset contrasts late-twentieth-century America as a whole with other modern nations, Dworkin measures the dominant character type in America today (the \\"imperial self\\" or \\"expressive individualist\\") against ideal typical personas in various civilizations at key moments in their development: the crumbling Roman empire of Augustine, medieval European aristocratic society, Tocqueville's America, and the United States of the 1950s \\"organization man.\\" The most intriguing aspect of Dworkin's project is how useful the categories of Augustinian psychology turn out to be in analyzing the ethos of diverse societies throughout history. <br /> <br />Dworkin is quite successful in substantiating his claim that \\"there is nothing new under the sun.\\" We can use to great advantage Augustine's notions about true peace, detachment, time horizon, self-love, and faith in the transcendent to sort out the struggles of democracy and aristocracy or postmodernism and the therapeutic ethos, just as the author of the City of God did in defending orthodox Christianity against Manicheism, Donatism, Platonism, and Gnosticism. Even our current \\"culture wars\\" have been played out before, albeit in proxy form. <br /> <br />Intriguingly, Dworkin's argument can be interpreted as a refutation of those (such as Lipset) who contend that there is something truly new and exceptional about America. In fact, the early American character described by Tocqueville with such admiration was separated from its aristocratic forebears of the ancien regime by three psychological factors (the republican principle, the force of public opinion, and the salience of Christian faith) which, Dworkin observes, have proven fragile amidst the vicissitudes of late modernity. Once these sources of virtue and restraint are stripped away, the American character reveals its true self, hidden like a recessive gene. The imperial self which emerges is once again aristocratic and self-aggrandizing in nature. Barricaded in \\"lifestyle enclaves\\" against the imagined threats of any truly public life, this expressive individualist dissipates himself in pursuit of empty self-fulfillment, devoid of the transcendent principles which guided the lives of his ancestors. Tocquevillian virtue was a mere blip on the time-line. <br /> <br />Dworkin's analysis thus lends itself to a thoroughly pessimistic construal of the prospects of American life. No type of deliverance is possible because, as imperial selves, we engage in a systematic refusal to acknowledge dependence on the transcendent. We condemn ourselves to disappointment, so Dworkin hardly needs to utter an explicit word of judgment. Lipset, by contrast, carefully probes America's cultural inheritance in hope of discovering strategies to accentuate the virtuous face of the double-edged sword. His guarded optimism for America's moral future is bounded by the realization that we cannot escape the legacy of our established political culture. The communitarian approaches that appeal to many today are unlikely to take root in this liberty-loving soil. Realistic hopes for ameliorization rest with the development of a \\"moral individualism\\" consistent with dominant American values, but prescinding from the self-interested atomism which characterizes America in its worst moments. The distinctive American ethos is flexible, though not infinitely so.	2005-10-11

Not only are the Soviets behind us in strategic weapons, he says, but they are behind in intermediate range and tactical nuclear arms in land forces and conventional strength on the European front, and in overall military spending. <br /> <br />Gervasi goes on to argue that the Reagan Administration's massive defense buildup has been sold to the U.S. public with lies and manipulated information, and that the Administration has systematically suppressed dissent by using threats, punishments and selective favors. <br /> <br />As a result, Gervasi concludes, most of the main-stream press and think-tanks have been dragooned into a conspiracy of deceit. The real reason the United States is amassing ever-greater arsenals, Gervasi states, is because the defense industrialists want to increase their already-swollen profits. <br /> <br />Perhaps because of the iconoclastic views presented, this book is sure to be quoted frequently, and its message will be widely spread. Gervasi, the director of the Center for Military Research and Analysis in New York, has amassed formidable statistical information. The appendixes, footnotes, end notes and index constitute more than half of the volume. The dust jacket notes with pride that \\"comprehensive notes and appendixes document where every piece of evidence was obtained.\\" So the quality of the author's command of facts, his care in argumentation, and his identification of sources become crucial in judging the book's value. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Gervasi indulges in much the same use of half-truths and tailored arguments for which he so justifiably excoriates his opponents. Regarding bombers, for example, Gervasi calls them and their weapons the \\"most important\\" (emphasizing megatonnage), \\"most accurate\\" of all, and highly dependable in reaching their targets. In supporting these assertions, however, he obscures the distinction between bombers which would penetrate Soviet air space at some risk to drop bombs or launch missiles, and aircraft which would stand off in relative safety and launch cruise missiles from a distance. Regarding submarine-launched ballistic missiles, he talks about the U.S. SLBMs of today being superior in accuracy to Soviet land-based rockets. While the U.S. Trident II D-5 missiles of tomorrow may have these characteristics, presently deployed U.S. SLBMs do not. One is left with a suspicion that the virtues of bombers and submarines are exaggerated and the effectiveness of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles minimized because Soviet strength is concentrated in the last category. <br /> <br />Regarding U.S. command and control, Gervasi argues that there is not \\"necessarily any need for a communications system that is sure to survive a nuclear attack. A retaliatory attack does not have to rely on such a system.\\" A hundred pages later, the author discusses the threat to Soviet command and control posed by Pershing-II missile deployments. There he quotes Defense Electronics magazine approvingly: \\"The removal of C2 (command and control) capability by a comparatively small number of Pershings would render much of the Soviet ICBM first strike and retaliatory forces impotent.\\" Gervasi seems to be arguing the case both ways. <br /> <br />According to Gervasi, U.S. Establishment spokesmen claim that American use of nuclear weapons in Europe would carry \\"no risk\\" of escalation to an intercontinental exchange. Perhaps one or two spokesmen have made such foolish claims, but there surely cannot have been very many of them. Gervasi also asserts, in arguing the balance of land forces in Europe, that Soviet forces \\"in the Leningrad, Baltic, Byelorussian and Carpathian military districts . . . are not in Europe.\\" <br /> <br />In quite afew cases, Gervasi's end notes do not support his statements in the text. For example, he cites a 1949 interview of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to claim that Dulles acknowledged that there was then no real evidence of a threat from the Soviet Union. This did not sound like the Dulles I knew, so I looked up Gervasi's end note, which cited \\"interview, U.S. News and World Report (March, 1949).\\" The citation carried no reference, incidentally, to the volume, number, date or page in the magazine, and I went through all four weekly issues of that month finding no interview. <br /> <br />Looking through other issues of the same year, I did find an interview with Dulles published on Jan. 21, 1949. That interview did not carry the words attributed to Dulles by Gervasi, however, and Dulles' tone was not as represented. Dulles said: \\"You have a tense situation like a dry autumn in the wood when any fool can start a fire. . . . Soviet communism teaches that, while you must work for the overthrow of non-communist governments, you have to pick your time. . . . The peoples of Western Europe . . . feel naked. . . . Russian Communists' . . . methods are violent. . . .\\" <br /> <br />Take another example. On Page 145, Gervasi asserts that \\"America paid $122 billion in 1982 alone to equip and maintain its forces in Europe.\\" The author's end note cites a 1983 article by Earl C. Ravenal -- even though, in his text, Gervasi attributes the information to the General Accounting Office. Comparing Gervasi's language with Ravenal's, one discovers that Gervasi misquoted Ravenal's figure by a few billion dollars and got the year wrong. <br /> <br />What Ravenal had done was to break down the total 1984 Defense Department budget request of $274 billion into European concerns, Asian concerns, Rapid Deployment Forces, and strategic programs. He then assigned more than 40% of the total to Europe, figuring that Europe was America's central military commitment. This gave Europe a prorated 40% share of all Defense appropriations of any kind -- from those supporting Army divisions in the United States, to new weapons development, service academies, recruiting stations, Pentagon operations, etc. Ravenal's organization of his data was odd, but at least he explained what he was doing. Gervasi uses Ravenal's figures to argue that U.S. forces stationed in Europe as a \\"token of support\\" for NATO cost egregious sums and -- besides -- are really maintained there to subjugate our European allies. <br /> <br />If the examples just given were representative of but a few aberrations in generally careful documentation, it would be one thing; but one could go on and on with additional instances of arguments and citations gone astray. It is a pity, because Gervasi has presented some truths. A powerful case can be made for much of what he believes. A few of his suspicions about the Reagan Administration are well founded without a doubt. The idea of Soviet military supremacy probably is a myth. I am reminded of a remark made by Madame de Stael about the Russians almost two centuries ago: \\"If they do not attain their objective, they always go past it.\\" Whether or not this be true of the Soviets, it does seem descriptive of Tom Gervasi <br /> <br />The Toronto Star, January 17, 1987 <br />The arms race: When enough is never enough <br /> <br /> TOM Gervasi is director of the Centre for Military Research and Analysis in New York and, one assumes, eminently qualified to write \\"the most comprehensive and fully documented analysis of the relative military capabilities of the two superpowers that has ever been published.\\" <br /> <br />Indeed, the problems this book poses have less to do with credibility than with tone. It reads suspiciously like an election manifesto for the Democrats, bashing Republicans with the stick of economic profligacy at every turn. <br /> <br />Gervasi's thesis is straightforward enough - in fact he sums it up himself in his opening paragraph: \\"I am acitizen who believes that our nation must have a strong defence. What I have found is that we already have one.\\" <br /> <br />And if that's not simplistic enough for you the rest of the book will make no sense at all. <br /> <br />The American taxpayers, then, have apparently been hoodwinked into shelling out billions to expand their nation's defence (or is it offence?) capabilities under the assumption that such expenditure is necessary to maintain strategic superiority over the Soviets who, Gervasi claims, are in reality hopelessly far behind in the arms race. <br /> <br />The main culprit, it seems, is the Star Wars program, which is, Gervasi insists, still closer to science-fiction than science-fact. <br /> <br />\\"According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the most powerful lasers we can build are more than a million times below the power level that would be needed to do any damage to more than a small fraction of the Soviet missile force in the time available and over the ranges required.\\" <br /> <br />It is, the author says, suspect logic that leads the U. S. government to pour such vast amounts of money into a scheme without any real evidence that it could possibly save anyone, but even more suspect logic that little effort is expended on what he fervently believes is a real solution: An international agreement to ban nuclear weapons of every kind. Another source of worry, and thus destabilization, is that the Soviets fear Star Wars technology will be used to knock out Soviet defence satellites long before it needs to be employed against missiles. <br /> <br />So often, indeed, does this book invoke our sympathies towards the fears of the Soviets that one begins to wonder where the author has been during the last 40 years of Soviet expansionism. <br /> <br />Since over 200 pages of this book are statistical charts listing such things as how many missiles, what kind of warheads, where situated, and so on, one feels somewhat churlish questioning the factuality of Gervasi's facts. Yet it must be done. <br /> <br />Indeed, statistics often seem a more potent weapon in the hands of politicians than the warheads themselves. <br /> <br />Since 1982, courtesy of President Ronald Reagan, the American public has been chastened with the knowledge that the Soviets have a definite margin of superiority in the arms race. According to Gervasi, this statement is a shameless lie based on juggled numbers and covert politicking by the Pentagon. <br /> <br />Yet the fact remains that, in the heated controversy that has arisen in the States over this book, Gervasi seems to have been out-accused by better informed sources. With all the boundless freedom available in the freedom-of-information act, we must accept the simple truth that, in matters of such complexity, we will always be at the mercy and ulterior motives of interpreters of one sort or the other. <br /> <br />The real strength of the book remains in Gervasi's sobering reminders about the realities of nuclear war. <br /> <br />Even with the most efficient defence system imaginable the chances are that several major cities would be destroyed. <br /> <br />Remembering the aftermath of the relatively minor destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this thought alone should underline the absurdity of any notion of defence more effectively than volumes of statistics. <br /> <br />As for the generals and their demands upon the public purse, Gervasi correctly observes that enough is never enough.	2005-10-09

Like the sparrow, such countries rely on evasion and manipulation in their dealings with the hawkish powers of the world. Longley develops his thesis by using U.S.--Costa Rican relations during the period from 1942 to 1957 as a case study. <br /> <br />Basing his arguments on voluminous printed and manuscript sources, including documents from Costa Rica's Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, Longley begins by reviewing the relationship during the administration of President Rafael Calderon (1940-1944), who proved a cooperative ally during World War II. Calderon's close ties with the Communist Party (the Vanguardia Popular) aroused little concern during the war. But U.S. officials became alarmed when his successor, Teodoro Picado (1944-1948), although staunchly pro-United States, failed to distance himself from a connection that was viewed with increasing disfavor. As a result, when Picado attempted to impose Calderon as his successor in 1948 and ignited the revolution led by Jose Figueres, the U.S. government favored the rebels despite reservations about Figueres. <br /> <br />With the triumph of the revolution, Figueres headed a junta that gave way in 1949 to the presidency of Otilio Ulate. In 1953 Figueres himself was elected president. Figueres and his associates (who formed the Partido Liberacion Nacional in 1951) undertook policies displeasing to Washington, such as nationalizing the banking system and negotiating a more favorable contract with the United Fruit Company. What most alarmed U.S. officials was Figueres's material and moral support for the Caribbean Legion, which was dedicated to the ouster of dictators in the region. Figueres didnot waver, however, and criticized U.S. support for the dictators, going so far as to boycott the 1954 inter-American meeting because it was held in Caracas, where President Marcos Perez Jimenez held sway. <br /> <br />Longley shows that Figueres pursued a nationalist agenda and at times defied Washington while retaining U.S. support when regimes that threatened U.S. hegemony (like those ruling Guatemala and Iran) faced extinction. Longley attributes Figueres's success to several factors, but above all to his anticommunist posture and to his preference for accommodation rather than confrontation. Figueres and the PLN also benefited from Costa Rica's favorable image in the United States and from a network of sympathizers, such as Adolf Berle and liberal members of the U.S. Congress. Longley might have undertaken a more extended comparison of the Costa Rican case with that of Guatemala, or better yet, with that of Bolivia, whose 1952 revolution also received benevolent treatment and substantial economic assistance from the United States. Cole Blasier's study of U.S. responses to twentieth-century revolutions in Latin America, The Hovering Giant (1985), pointed out the essential moderation of Victor Paz Estenssoro and other B olivian leaders and their skill in cultivating advocates in Washington. <br /> <br />In the conclusion to The Sparrow and the Hawk, Longley generalizes beyond the Costa Rican case to that of small countries in their dealings with major powers. Adapting the thesis of James Scott's Weapons of the Weak: Everyday Forms of Peasant Resistance (1985), Longley argues that subordinate states, like peasants, can devise nonviolent strategies that enable them to shape their relations with the United States. Thus Longley, like Gambone, aligns himself firmly with those who assign agency to peripheral states.	2005-10-08

The New York Times November 29, 1987, Sunday, Late City Final Edition (Review of 2 books, including, Covert Action: The CIA and the Limits of American Intervention in the Postwar World, only this book review included here)    The torrent of revelations about the Iran-contra affair during the summer's televised hearings, and in the recently released report of the Congressional committees that conducted the hearings, has made Americans aware both of the importance of covert action in the foreign policy of their country and of its risks and costs. These two books do nothing to rehabilitate its reputation or to improve its image...     ...Mr. Higgins, whose style is anything but graceful, uses strong primary colors to paint the ''perfect failure'' of the Bay of Pigs. He makes no new revelations, but his solid research -in memoirs, declassified documents and interviews -leads to stark and damning conclusions. A reluctant President Kennedy inherited a half-baked plan for the invasion of Cuba prepared by the C.I.A. under President Eisenhower. Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, mistook for an approval the Joint Chiefs of Staff's mere acquiescence to a plan that the military, deep down, deemed insufficient.    Even so, Kennedy's desire to make the American role in the operation as invisible as possible forced the organizers to move the site of the landing from the town of Trinidad (on Cuba's south coast, near mountains into which the invaders could have retreated) to the swamp of the Bay of Pigs, 80 miles from the nearest mountains, and led them to dilute and delay the air strikes that were supposed to cover the operation. Even if the original plan for these strikes had been followed, Mr. Higgins believes - rightly, in my opinion -that Mr. Castro would have won, given his will to fight. The military requirement for success was a large American participation in the invasion. The political necessity of presenting the affair as an attempt by Cubans to liberate their island, and of avoiding a wave of anti-Americanism in Latin America, excluded such participation - and doomed the undertaking.    MR. HIGGINS praises Kennedy for having resisted strong pressures toward a more open and considerable American military intervention, and he suggests that the C.I.A. planners, Allen Dulles and Richard Bissell, had allowed a timid plan to go into effect because they gambled that its very flaws would force the President's hand. But the author also shows how shoddy the decision-making process within the Administration had been; such dissenters as Under Secretary of State Chester Bowles and Senator J. William Fulbright were not taken seriously. Kennedy was the victim of his own lack of experience, of his anti-Communism (or liberal imperialism), of his need to show toughness (especially as he was resisting pressure to intervene in Laos) and of a time bomb inherited from his predecessor: the Cuban exiles who were being trained in Guatemala were increasingly unwelcome there, and as Mr. Treverton puts it, ''There seemed only one place to put [them] - Cuba.''    After the fiasco, an investigation within the C.I.A. concluded that the operation had been ''too big to be a raid and too small to be an invasion.'' When one looks at President Reagan's far more overt action against Nicaragua, one realizes that his Administration is determined not only to do away with the so-called Vietnam syndrome but to ignore the lessons of the Bay of Pigs as well.	2005-10-04

The action in Guatemala led officials to believe that such successes could be repeated elsewhere; it ''consolidated the ascendancy of covert action over espionage, and of operations over intelligence in the CIA,'' in Mr. Treverton's words - and it led directly to the Bay of Pigs and to the later operations in Chile that toppled that country's Government.

Mr. Treverton, who writes elegantly, paints an often dirty scene in pastel colors.     ---  1987 Foreign Affairs  1987 / 1988, Winter    RECENT BOOKS ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: The United States; Pg. 438  This is a succinct, authoritative history and critique of the government's use of covert action to shape or overthrow foreign regimes. Mr. Treverton's interest in the subject began in 1975 when he served on the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (the Church Committee). His conclusion, based on deep knowledge of major actions (Iran, Guatemala, Cuba, Chile, Angola and others), is that covert action cannot be kept secret, usually has consequences far different from and less desirable than those intended, often ties the U.S. to clients who are not easily controlled, undermines the comparative advantage which the United States has as an open society, and is almost always a bad idea.  ---  Los Angeles Times, October 18, 1987  THE SEARCH FOR A 'MAGIC BUTTON' IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY;    I first encountered CIA covert action operations in the early 1960s in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where I was serving my initial tour of duty as an American Foreign Service officer. A powerful anti-communist documentary film called \\"We Will Bury You\\" had been released commercially in several local theaters. On the second day of screenings, a teen-age boy who was bicycling reels from theater to theater was stopped by a gang of communist toughs. The can of film was stolen and the boy was shot in the head. A public uproar ensued. The U.S. Consulate quickly arranged for the boy to be flown to the U.S. Army hospital in the Panama Canal Zone, where mercifully he recovered.    Years later, when I headed an investigative task force for the Senate Intelligence Committee, I learned the true story of that incident. The \\"communist toughs\\" were CIA \\"assets\\" hired to create an incident to promote the film. But when the boy resisted and tried to get away with the film, they panicked and shot him.    Gregory F. Treverton's book, \\"Covert Action: The Limits of Intervention in the Postwar World,\\" is full of stories of CIA schemes gone wrong. In one surprising revelation, he describes how CIA Director William Casey, angry at his experts on terrorism for coming up with little evidence linking the Soviet Union to terror groups, ordered them to read Claire Sterling's famous book \\"The Terror Network.\\" They did and found that virtually all of the examples she cited turned out to be CIA disinformation -- false stories planted in the foreign press that she unwittingly used in good faith.    But the book also examines operations that, in the view of many, went right -- like overthrowing Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala and Mossadeq in Iran in the 1950s. Treverton has little patience with arguments that the coup that ousted Mossadeq and restored the Shah to power lies at the core of our present conflict with Iran. He points out that the Shah was identified with the United States in many ways besides that one -- most prominently, wasteful arms purchases from the United States -- and that the CIA covert action that secured his throne brought about a quarter century of stability, no small feat in the turbulent Middle East.    Those initial successes set the pattern for other covert actions, some of which were disasters like the Bay of Pigs. This story has been told elsewhere, but Treverton treats us to new insights. Particularly shocking is his explanation that the invasion was considered foolproof because the exile brigade originally planned to land at the town of Trinidad, where, if something went wrong, they could melt into the mountains.    But, at the last minute, Secretary of State Dean Rusk objected, prefering a \\"quieter site\\" for the landing. The Bay of Pigs was finally chosen, the planners apparentlyoverlooking the fact that the mountains would then be 80 miles away across a swamp!    Treverton, a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, draws important lessons both for the public and for officials responsible for covert operations. He shows how the momentum of covert-action projects often carries them far beyond their original scope, citing not only the Bay of Pigs but efforts against Salvador Allende in Chile, which ultimately ended in the coup in which he was killed, and the Reagan Administration's undiminished stake in the contras. Treverton explains why covert actions are inherently difficult to control and often produce unintended results -- such as U.S. support for the Jonas Savimbi forces in Angola, putting us on the same side as South Africa and thus damaging our reputation throughout black Africa.    Though often critical of the CIA, the author makes clear that one reason Presidents turn to covert action is that the Agency is extremely competent and gets the job done. He points out that Presidents are not tools of the CIA; rather the White House is often the source of pressure to come up with covert operations and even originates some of the more ill-considered ideas, such as the Iran-contra caper.    I recall during my days as a Senate investigator finding a piece of yellow note pad with jottings from a meeting with White House officials during the Kennedy Administration that discussed an \\"Executive Action\\" or, in plain English, an assass-- capability. The notes referred to it as the \\"magic button.\\"    This unfortunately is all too often the mind set of senior government leaders when they consider the \\"covert option\\"; namely, that somehow magically it will sweep away threats or obstacles to the success of U.S. policy. As Treverton points out, we have failed as often as we have succeeded, and even then our successes frequently cause us to forget about the underlying causes of the problems we face. For example, after Arbenz was deposed in Guatemala, we ignored Central America until the Sandinistas reminded us of the revolutionary potential of injustice in that region.    Treverton notes that the world's revolutionaries have also learned a thing or two about covert action. As in Nicaragua they have discovered how to use CIA pressure to rally their publics against U.S. intervention. Fledgling left-wing regimes turn more quickly to Moscow for protection. The contrast with the past is striking: Arbenz was overthrown with 300 men; at the Bay of Pigs we hoped to overthrow Castro with 750 exiles and a tiny air force; but now, the CIA is supporting an army of 10,000 contras and still nobody thinks they have a prayer of displacing the Sandinistas.    The striking change from the 1950s is that virtually all major covert actions now become public, often before they are concluded. Increasingly, the U.S. government doesn't care. American support for the Afghan resistance is not a secret, only unacknowledged. Still, bad decisions like trading arms for hostages are made without full appreciation of what will happen when, inevitably, the story leaks out.    The most important contribution of Treverton's brilliant analysis is to demythicize covert action. It is not a romantic \\"magic button\\" that does away with the need for sound military and diplomatic strategies. It does not allow us to ignore economic and social realities in the turbulent underdeveloped world. But neither are such CIA operations the cause of all our troubles or inherently evil, as many critics might suggest.    I firmly believe that covert action has a legitimate role in U.S. national security, but as Treverton makes clear, such operations are only as sound as the policy they seek to advance. The risks are always substantial and success is often fleeting.    Ultimately, I became chairman of the National Security Council subcommittee that was responsible for intelligence operations during the Carter Administration. I only wish I had been able to readTreverton's fascinating and compelling book before doing so. For all those who may in the future have a role in such clandestine intelligence operations, including the watchdogs in Congress, \\"Covert Action\\" is required reading.	2005-10-04

But the freshness and strength of these voices from a culture in which 'women can do everything; men can do the rest' easily withstand change. <br /> <br />The Boston Globe, March 8, 1993  <br />...Francine du Plessix Gray, in her book \\"Soviet Women: Walking the Tightrope,\\" notes a long tradition in Russian culture, \\"marked by men's ambivalent awe and resentment of forceful females\\" - a trait reflected in literature by an \\"idealization of women's moral virtues\\" and a \\"negative, ascetic attitude toward women's sensuality and intellect.\\" <br /> <br />Gray attributes this pattern to centuries of domination by the Russian Orthodox Church, which emphasized a fear of women's sexual powers, to the point where, for many years, women were forbidden to attend services during their menstrual periods and only those past childbearing age could bake Communion bread. <br /> <br />The Washington Times, July 1, 1991  <br />The Soviet Union has the highest abortion rate in the world (between five and eight abortions for every birth), and the nation's ignorance relating to sexual matters is equaled only in the most backward countries, according to Francine Du Plessix Gray in Soviet Women: Walking the Tightrope.  <br /> <br />Motivated by memories of her own Russian mother, the novelist traveled from Riga to Irkutsk, questioning women from all walks of life. Author of six other books, including \\"Lovers and Tyrants\\" and \\"World Without End,\\" she doesn't mince words and paints a painful picture of repression. <br /> <br />Most fascinating of all the sexual issues she explores is the paradox of the Russian women's liberation movement compared with its U.S. counterpart. Embittered by years of deprivation and overwork, Russian women are fighting to get out of the work force and back home to domesticity.<br /> <br />New & Noteworthy The New York Times May 19, 1991 <br /> <br />Traveling through the Soviet Union, an American novelist of Russian descent finds that oppression has hardened the women to the point that the country \\"might be as much in need of a men's movement as of a women's movement.\\" Last year our reviewer, Ruth Daniloff, said, \\"The portraits are drawn with humor and warmth, interspersed with history and social observation.\\" <br /> <br />Notable Books of the Year The New York Times December 2, 1990 <br />Brilliant, sympathetic portraits of overworked, frustrated women whose men have neither the authority of patriarchs nor the utility of househusbands. <br /> <br />USA TODAY, October 22, 1990 <br /> <br />Lenin promised Soviet women liberation and equality. Instead, Soviet women are overburdened by policies that deny them birth control, proper health care and day-care centers yet encourage full-time careers and child- bearing, the author says. <br /> <br />The result: a matriarchy of self-sacrificing women, passive men, frequently abandoned infants and as many as five to eight abortions for each live birth. The average female worker, slightly better educated than her male counterpart, earns only about two-thirds his income. Almost half of Soviet women are manual laborers or unskilled. <br /> <br />Author Francine du Plessix Gray, says the Soviet and the U.S. women's movements are traveling in opposite directions. Many Soviet women long for traditional roles and dominant men. <br /> <br />An insightful look at Soviet women from all levels of society. <br /> <br />Books: Sisters in the Red brigades The Guardian (London) September 20, 1990 <br /> <br />THE WORLD may stop thinking that all Soviet women are 'ba bushkas' after reading Francine du Plessix Gray. She has let them speak for themselves. <br /> <br />Ms Gray explored the land of her ancestors in an effort to 'document some of the obstacles which have stood in the way of Soviet women's self-fulfilment: misogyny, the double burdens of work and family, a scandalous insufficiency of child support measures, a vastly deteriorated health system, a dearth of basic commodities.' <br /> <br />Her account of the plight of women in the Soviet Union is detailed and, in most instances, accurate. Her sources, Soviet women and a few male doctors who 'care deeply about women's well-being,' at times may get so carried away as to refer, in front of journalists, to the leading members of the USSR ministry of health as 'criminals' and 'murderers,' but they put you in the picture. <br /> <br />The picture is that Soviet women over the past decade have had to survive in an austere environment that lacks the most basic things such as food, clothing, contraceptives, kindergartens, virtually everything. They have a culture of their own, one that is unique and has been the fruit of living under stress and the need to scrape by in spite of the 'widespread machismo of Soviet men' and the government's neglect of women's issues. <br /> <br />There is the widespread sexual ignorance as a result of which '70 per cent of Soviet women have never had an orgasm,' abominable maternity homes which have been described by Soviet women as 'our best contraceptive' for many of them are afraid to repeat the experience, Soviet gynaecologists who complain that Soviet-made condoms 'break up on first use' or claim that they 'can fix any contraindication' to an IUD coil. <br /> <br />A major contributor to this environment has been the almost medieval level of sexism in Soviet society, where even a most ardent male supporter of the women's health issues, someone like Dr Archil Khomassuridze, the head of the Soviet Union's only medical centre that is a full-fledged member of the World Health Organisation, may be chauvinistic enough to 'refuse employing women for their own sake,' so as not to distract them from the family, 'their first priority.' <br /> <br />As a result women have evolved a very distinct attitude towards men, who are seen by an increasing number of women in the USSR as a 'second child,' to look after. Women are growing more career-conscious and more independent (this coming as a sort of paradox as some of them still 'miss not being able to depend on a beloved man'). On the other hand, they resent men's reluctance to help them out with housework and their having almost 'two days extra' every week. Women are casting off their fear of remaining unmarried, and often a good relationship with a man is far from their top priority. ('Let the man be on his way' after the child has been conceived.) The book may give the reader the false impression that Soviet women are all too powerful and invulnerable, while the men are 'a tonic' or 'a Finnish sauna' to them. This isn't quite so. Women are busy surviving, and that's what makes them so aggressive, while aggression is not necessarily their inherent property. Half of Soviet women polled may 'outrightly state that they detest sexual contact,' but most are not happy that they feel that way. They are just women whose philosophies and habits have been twisted by the idiocy of their society, but not to the point where they consciously choose to abandon their families, confining themselves to the pursuit of careers. <br /> <br />The book presents quite a negative view of Soviet men, who may not be the most gallant of gentlemen but, mind you, they too have lived in a twisted society and have in varying degrees succumbed to its influence. In her busy if even somewhat hasty travels through the Soviet Union Ms Gray may have seen a lot of henpecked husbands, but the percentage is not that high in this society. The current husband-wife relationship in Soviet society is probably as complex and hard to categorise as the contemporary social and economic trends there. <br /> <br />People survive in the harshest of environments, and some of them cope better than others. Similarly, in the Soviet Union some women manage, miraculouslyand contrary to the widespread philosopy, to 'achieve power without losing their tenderness.' This wonderful achievement has been convincingly illustrated by Francine du Plessix Gray, who has come up with an incisive and informative yet personal and at times romantic piece of writing. <br /> <br />BOOK REVIEW / That old blat magic has her still in slavery; The Independent (London) August 19, 1990, Sunday   <br /> <br />THERE IS A linguistic theory which holds that the most central everyday concepts are usually expressed in words of four letters: work, for instance, or milk. The normally polysyllabic Russian language seems triumphantly to bear out this idea in the word blat. <br /> <br />Blat is what it takes to get anything in the Soviet Union, from a coveted pair of shoes (slip a bottle of imported brandy to the salesgirl) to an abortion with the benefit of anaesthetic (Swiss chocolates and French perfume will fetch the doctor to your house). Without blat or connections, the 14 abortions that the average Soviet woman suffers during her fertile life will probably be performed ''in a hall splattered with blood where two doctors are aborting seven or eight women at the same time; they're usually very rough and rude, shouting at you about keeping your legs open . . . if you're lucky they give you a little sedative, mostly Valium. Then it's your turn to stagger to the resting room, where you're not allowed to spend more than two hours because the production line is always very busy.'' <br /> <br />This is the testimony of Olga Lipovskaya, a 35-year-old Leningrad woman who edits the country's only feminist magazine, and one of scores of Russians, mostly women, whom Francine du Plessix Gray interviewed during her tour of the Soviet Union. The resulting book is a remarkable documentary of quotidian Soviet life. We hear from women of a variety of professions, most of whose lives are rapidly being transformed by glasnost. There's a sexologist; a psychiatrist and patients ata suicide clinic; a designer and some artists; a writer, a hotel worker, several doctors. In edited transcripts liberally salted with her own very decided views, Gray conveys the reality of their days and explores their painful two-fold identity crisis, half old, half new. The old part is that the idea of ''liberation'' for Soviet women, with their double load as producers and reproducers, has always been a cruel joke; the new is that now they are not communists any more, they do not know what they are instead. <br /> <br />The book's many voices painlessly feed us an encyclopaedic quantity of statistics. Soviet women commonly leave home at 7.30am and return at 8pm. Only 5 per cent use any efficient method of birth control (hence the 14 abortions). They spend up to two hours a day queuing for food; they do all the work in the house as well. Though the first women in the world to get the vote, they live like slaves. Soviet men, it goes almost without saying, are represented as little above the Neanderthal. <br /> <br />The book is a mine of deliciously quotable quotes: ''Perhaps one of the finest results of our glasnost will be the manufacture of Tampax'', for example, or ''Soviet women may well have the highest rate of culturally repressed orgasm in the world.'' <br /> <br />Much in this book is flawed and partial. Brought up by a Russian mother and grandmother, Gray states her aim to be one of fathoming the ''mysterious, unique power of Russian women'', and she conveniently finds many interviewees who support her thesis. But her book makes horrifying and enthralling reading for us all. Gorbachev (because of the glowing tributes to him, both explicit and implicit) should read it to cheer himself up. <br /> <br />Times Newspapers Limited, August 19, 1990  <br /> <br />If ever there were a lively dialogue between the dumb and the deaf it is to be found in Francine Du Plessix Gray's account of her conversations with Soviet women. Though allowed to travel freely in theUSSR, under the new dispensation, Gray took with her much heavy baggage stuffed with American pieties about feminism and ''women's issues''. <br /> <br />Happily for her book, Gray was met with incredulity and incomprehension when she unpacked her feminist wares. And her political exuberance for the Gorbachev ''revolution'' received short shrift. ''We have more glasnost than we can handle, but we'll never have perestroika,'' she was told by Tatiana Tolstaya, the novelist. It is unclear what the women felt about their American guest, but some of Gray's questions about official corruption and belief in God seem to have confirmed the widely held belief that they were in the presence of some being from another planet.  <br /> <br />Soviet Women gives one the sense of an explorer travelling among people who wear their heads beneath their arms. The feeling is strengthened by frequent references to ''us'' and ''them''. ''They'' are the Russians. ''We'' are always, and only, Americans. Thus when Gray's eye falls on dissenters in Izmailovo Park they bear ''a striking resemblance to our own 1960s''. And her approach to each of the women she interviews is not to find out what each thinks of herself but ''aims to decipher her views of us''. <br /> <br />But nothing is that simple in the Soviet Union. It's one of the pleasures of this book that Gray never seeks to conceal her surprise and even more revealing her dismay at the responses she receives. It turns out that Russian women have no strong opinions of American women, except envy of their figures. On the contrary, what Russian women really like are American men. They are admired for their ''gentlemanliness'', adored for their ''casual elegance'', their gallantry and cordiality and celebrated for their talents as ''good providers''. <br /> <br />It ought to make a feminist fume. But of course this is not really the way Soviet women feel about American men. For a start, very few will have met an American male. But they haveseen a lot of good, old-fashioned movies. And they have read Gone With the Wind, which Gray found, to her perplexity, was regarded as one of the great classics of American literature. This perhaps explains the Soviet woman's unusual reading of the talents of American men. <br /> <br />In fact, many Soviet women use, not just American, but any foreign males, as ammunition in their war against their own men. In the words of Alya, a streetwalker I once knew in Moscow, ''foreign is fun''. Gray consulted no prostitutes, but if she had done so she would have found they confirmed the view of most women that just about any ''foreign'' is fun by comparison with what is regarded as the dour and boorish Russian male. Russian women are not anti-men. But they're distinctly displeased with the home-grown variety and, in particular, that stock figure of fun, contempt and pity, the husband. <br /> <br />What Gray's book makes clear is that the Soviet Union is the world standing on its head for the conventional Western feminist. Soviet women positively like cooking, knitting and having babies and keeping the home. They distrust the idea of women's liberation and they detest what they see as its aggressive American variant. Despite a marked hostility towards it, even among women with otherwise remarkably liberal views, Gray continues to force the comparison. The hostility of her ''Soviet sisters'' she ascribes to ''their decades of cultural isolation''. The trouble, it seems, is that ''they'' have never read Woolf or de Beauvoir, they have never had access to our basic feminist texts. ''These are the regrets of the missionary among some archaic tribe reporting back to biblical mission control.'' <br /> <br />It is not about the lives of women that these conversations are most revealing. Rather, they show just how wretched life is for very many Soviet citizens: squalid hospitals, empty shops, graft, corruption, irascible officials, lousy housing, increasing street violence and growingfrustration. Seventy years after the great experiment in human progress the place is a dismal mess. Perestroika and glasnost are, in fact, party-led reforms, directed from above and woefully inadequate. <br /> <br />In these pages Soviet women (editors, television executives, scientists, wives, mothers, daughters) arrive at an unexpected consensus. They're allowed to do everything, but, left to their own devices, women would do a lot less, and do it at home. Gray estimates that 98% of street sweepers are women. There are also more doctors, engineers and teachers amongst women. But their bosses remain men men who see women, with their high work rates and indefatigable industry, as ''our Japanese''. <br /> <br />As for Russian men, Tatiana Tolstaya refuses to take the predictable view. Men need special treatment, they wear out so much sooner. ''Women are the roots, men are just the leaves.'' In its marvellous blend of pity and disdain, this raises the debate to a level to which the missionary zeal and frequent astonishments of Soviet Women seldom aspires. <br /> <br />Soviet Women: Walking the Tightrope._book reviews, The Nation, June 4, 1990 <br /> <br />Seventy-three years after the Russian Revolution, Soviet women are confronting a powerful backlash against its emancipation of women. Glasnost is allowing Soviet citizens to voice patriarchal prejudices once banned as bourgeois or counterrevolutionary. The state-controlled news media, for example, frequently blame \\"overemancipated, masculinized women\\" for social ills from juvenile delinquency to divorce. And Mikhail Gorbachev's ambivalent positions on the role of women in political and economic life, along with the social policies proposed by the Communist Party and the Congress of People's Deputies earlier this year, further strengthen the view that only women are responsible for children and housework.  <br /> <br />So far, perestroika has failed to change Soviet women's secondary position in the work force or shorten their second shift at home. Measures proposed by the Communist Party to \\"improve the working and living conditions of women\\"' for example, will allow women to work fewer hours a week; release them from heavy work and labor injurious to their health (usually the highest-paying jobs); and increase prenatal, maternal and workplace funded leave for mothers of large families and single mothers. These policies, however generous and necessary, fail to address the fundamental inequalities women suffer. Official discussions of women's double burden rarely extend to men's family responsibilities-or consider society's responsibility for family welfare. The idea of parental, as opposed to maternal, leave was unthinkable until this year. (In April the Supreme Soviet passed a resolution which for the first time allows \\"fathers, grandfathers or other family members\\" the right to take unpaid child care leave.) <br /> <br />Why is this happening in a country that produced the first woman ambassador and the first woman in space? The Soviet Union contains the largest number of women professionals and specialists on the globe, and close to 90 percent of its female population is in the work force. Early Soviet legislation sought to secure full economic and social equality for women. They were to be employed in the public sector as a condition of complete equality, and the responsibility for housework and child care was to shift from the individual household to the collective. But the disruptions of war, large-scale unemployment, rampant inflation and Stalin's conservative social policies meant that few resources were devoted to social programs. Although opportunities for women in the labor force expanded, the socialization of housework never took shape. <br /> <br />As a result, many Soviet women express yearning for a traditional female role centered around the family and the home. They are exhausted by decades of paper equality and a double burden made more difficult by consumershortages (a recent Soviet survey shows that 275 billion hours, equal to 90 percent of the time devoted to paid work in the national economy as a whole, are spent on shopping, child care and housework each year, most of it spent by women). Yet recent national polls show that only 20 percent of Soviet women would quit their jobs even if they could afford to. And most Soviet women, like their American counterparts, still need to work full time in order to make ends meet. Other women, fewer in number but increasingly vocal, are taking advantage of increased opportunities for political and social activism. Some are even espousing Western-style feminism, as they understand it. <br /> <br />Francine du Plessix Gray set out in 1987 to capture a society in flux through the voices of its women. She admits to a dual purpose: to examine \\"the first community of women in history to be officially emancipated\\" and to decode \\"the forceful spell that Russian women have had on me for much of my life\\" (Gray was raised in Paris by a-Russian mother, grandmother and governess). Her nostalgia for the cozy and aristocratic milieu of her Russian maternal relatives may have led her to talk mainly to educated, urban, successful\\" women. There are no rural women, or engineers or scientists in Soviet Women (although there are many doctors, a more traditional female occupation), and only a few token workers. Her portraits of women in their homes, at work or in hospitals and clinics are always meticulously observed and often lyrical. A distinguished writer of fiction and nonfiction, Gray tells these women's stories like a novelist. <br /> <br />The strength of Gray's book is its reporting on how women are being affected by a deteriorating health care system. Gray hears stories about the brutal treatment of women during childbirth. On visits to several hospitals, she documents the primitive conditions: the unchanged, blood-smeared sheets on nursing mothers' beds, the lack of bathing facilities andthe patients' shabby, prison like hospital gowns. Men are not allowed to visit their wives or children for fear that they will infect them. The great irony of the Soviet Union's backwardness in the field of gynecology is that the technique of prepared childbirth had originated there several decades ago (the Frenchman who introduced it to the West, Dr. Lamaze, had actually learned it in the Soviet Union in the early 1950s from two Soviet doctors, Platonov and Velkovskii). Today the Lamaze method is virtually unheard of in the Soviet Union, and women have little or nothing to say about the conduct of their labor. According to Gray, only one clinic in the Soviet Union, in the more westernized Baltic Republic of Latvia, practices family birthing techniques. <br /> <br />Abortion is the primary method of birth control-not by choice but because of the absence of reliable contraceptives (diaphragms come in only two sizes, and condoms are called galoshi, winch means just what it sounds like). There are four to eight abortions, depending on whose statistics you trust, for every live birth. The conditions in abortion clinics that Gray describes are now being graphically detailed in the Soviet press. Last year, for example, Moscow News published an account of one woman's ordeal under the headline, \\"I Don't Want to Be Sorry I'm a Woman:' The author, Yekaterina Nikolayeva, recalled her experience in an abortion clinic. A doctor yelled at her for staring at his bloodstained gloves and scolded another woman by saying, \\"You should have had second thoughts before. You're all fond of sweets, but you're not willing to pay the price: \\" <br /> <br />The article led the highest-ranking woman in the Soviet government, Aleksandra Biryukova, to order a Health Ministry investigation. She promised that the contraceptive industry would radically increase its output over the next two years. But Biryukova's call for change will not be easily answered. The Soviet reproductive health system needsradical restructuring before it can serve women humanely and effectively, and the lack of contraceptives is not the only problem. Family-planning programs are almost nonexistent and have no way to counter widespread beliefs that contraceptives are unreliable, dangerous or unobtainable. (No sex education materials designed for women are readily available now, but next year Progress Publishers may publish Our Bodies, Ourselves.) <br /> <br />Unlike the abortion debate in the West, which pits the putative rights of the fetus against women's right to choose, the Soviet discussion is about women's health care-the right to adequate supplies of reliable contraceptives, sanitary conditions, anesthetics and the respect of medical workers. As of now, there is no national debate in the Soviet Union about the morality of abortion. But rising ethnic tensions in the Russian Republic and in the Caucasus, for example, could open that issue because they strengthen patriarchal religions which have a dim view of women. (A similar phenomenon is occurring in Poland, where the Catholic Church is trying to use its influence with Solidarity to curtail abortion and the availability of contraceptives.) <br /> <br />Few Soviet sexologists (a surprisingly busy and esteemed specialty) will discuss homosexuality, and decades of cultural isolation from the West and of repressive laws have insured that sexual attitudes remain reactionary. (Although lesbianism was never officially outlawed, homosexuals have been jailed for up to eight years under a statute that, according to press reports, is likely to be repealed this year.) But there have been glimmers of opposition. In December 1979 a group of Leningrad women issued a samizdat publication, Almanac Women and Russia. It was the first self-consciously feminist text produced in the Soviet Union since the early 1920s, and its half-dozen contributors wrote about the flaws of Soviet gynecology, the scarcity of consumer goods and the general overburdening of women, problems that are aired today by numerous women in the glasnost press. What was unusual about Almanac was its accounts of lesbian relationships, a reality of Soviet life that is only now being acknowledged (albeit euphemistically and grudgingly). <br /> <br />Ten years earlier, in November 1969, Natalya Baranskaya'snovellaa Week Like Any Other was published in the prestigious literary journal Novy Mir. (It has just been published in English, along with several of Baranskaya's short stories, by Seal Press.) Written in the form of a week's diary entries, it details the nightmare of one woman's daily life: food shortages, endless fines, poor health care and day care, the lack of basic household services and a husband who buries himself in the TV or newspapers and never lifts a finger. When he suggests to Olga, a young scientist, that she stop working and stay home to take care of the family (a familiar proposal these days), she is appalled: \\"You want to shut me in here for the whole year! How could we live on your salary! ... All this boring stuff is for me alone, and the only interesting things are for you! \\" Olga's story touched a raw nerve; Baranskaya received hundreds of letters from grateful women thanking her for telling the truth about their lives. hat was twenty years ago; it's taken women that long to get started. Since 1989 there has been an upsurge of independent (that is, outside party control) activism by women. And although there are still no signs of a mass movement, independent women's associations have emerged around the country. But Soviet Women doesn't take these developments into account. (To be fair, things are changing so rapidly in the Soviet Union these days that many books are outdated by the time they are published.) Gray writes that women are \\"hindered from cohesive action, to this day, by their government's censure of any feminist' movement that would function outside of party control ... and by their curious lack of solidarity.\\" Her comment that during her travels she \\"barely found two\\" other feminists is difficult to understand. One evening last December I sat in a newspaper office in Moscow and listened to twenty women from eight different independent associations define what feminism meant to them. Many were in their 20s, contradicting Gray's view that the younger generation has lost contact with feminist traditions. In fact, the emerging women's associations are composed of women of different ages and different political and professional orientations. <br /> <br />In Moscow, Olga Voronina and a group of women scholars have established the League for Society's Liberation from Stereotypes (LOTOS), which is beginning to articulate a gender analysis of Soviet society. Olga Bessolova has revived a once dormant Women's Council in the Aerohydrodynamics Institute in Zhukovsky, sixty kilometers from has organized a Women's Initiative Club, which lobbies the town government for better services and holds bimonthly consciousness-raising, and an Inter-Regional Women's Political Club, which organizes political training workshops for women and nominates women to run in local and national races. Last January I attended one of the Initiative Club's meetings. Forty women-professionals, scholars, journalists, engineers and factory workers-gathered for four hours. These women believe that the solution to the \\"women's question\\" lies not in the improvement of consumer goods and services but in the redefinition of male and female social roles'. One month earlier, a federation of women writers was formed inside the Russian Writer's Union, and women filmmakers and journalists have started lobbying groups to fight for higher pay and better working conditions. (The Soviet Union still has only one female foreign correspondent.) In March several women formed a women's center in Moscow which will offer legal consultation as well as political leadership training. In Leningrad, Elena Zelinskaya, who heads a women'scooperative association and the Northwest Information Agency, a network of independent journalists in Leningrad, was recently appointed to chair the City Council Commission on Communication. In Uzbekistan (where Gray interviews a \\"narcissistic Communist official\\" and a \\"Dragon Lady\\"), Rozika Mergenbaeva makes documentaries about the appalling conditions under which women and girls work in the cotton fields. <br /> <br />More disturbing than these omissions is Gray's conclusion, presented early in the book, that \\"the Soviet Union might be as much in need of a men's movement as of a women's movement.\\" She tries the idea out on some of her Soviet friends and finds it very well received:' But the women Gray asks, and who inform this book, are almost exclusively strong and successful women who live with either their mothers or children or with passive, emasculated men, whom they deride in Gray's presence. As someone who has traveled regularly to the Soviet Union in the past ten years, I'd say the country has had a men's movement all along; only now are women's concerns emerging on the fringes of the male-dominated political and cultural outpourings that characterize glasnost. What kind of matriarchy pays its female workers two-thirds of the average male income, gives women the dirty manual jobs while insuring that they cannot reach the top of the professions and then blames \\"masculinized\\" women for every social problem? <br /> <br />Gray emerges as a kind of romantic feminist, accepting the view, so popular among the Soviet intel political elite, that Soviet women have an essence that is indisputably different from that of men. \\"In this laboratory of emancipation offered us by the Soviet Union' \\" Gray concludes, \\"in this epochal experiment which has engaged women in the work force longer and more fully than any society in history, the paradoxical equality' between the sexes may well symbolize a central dilemma of the human condition: the female's secret and ambivalent desire to lead and be led, the male's confusion and resentment before her mysterious force and her often awesome versatility:' Throughout all levels of Soviet society, she writes, \\"one is constantly awed by women's keen sense of their greater patience, diligence, optimism, endurance, shrewdness and selfesteem-a self-esteem apparently heightened by the very arduousness of their everyday duties, their incessant foraging for basic necessities of food and clothing.\\" Gray continues, \\"Many women I talked to prefer to remain exhausted, to continue complaining and to keep their husbands out of the kitchen, where 'it is not their place to be.' \\" Perhaps, she notes, this stance makes more sense if viewed in the great Russian literary tradition that depicts women's suffering as a redemptive force. In the end, she creates the same image of women created by Russian male authors in the nineteenth century: heroines considerably more powerful than their male counterparts. Those authors placed women on pedestals, the better to admire their suffering while keeping them in their place. The structure of much of the booksmall-scale, impressionistic pictures of women in their homes, with their children and, occasionally, \\"henpecked\\" husbands-places women in a traditional surrounding....	2005-10-03

They cover a broad historical time frame, from the mediaeval to the modern, and examine representations of female sexuality and women's bodies from the perspectives of historical interpretation, cultural analysis, literary investigation and critical theory. The analytical framework of the essays draws greatly on the work of recent French feminist and cultural theorists, such as Foucault, whose writings on the history of sexuality have influenced work in this area for over a decade. The book also examines the ways in which women and men view sexuality and representations of the body differently and the authors draw here on British and American writings on 'the female gaze'. As such, this book provides an interdisciplinary text which utilises prominent Western critical theories to highlight the specifics of Russian cultural thinking in the area of female sexuality. <br /> <br />The introduction to the book provides an extensive outline of a number of issues which influence our thinking on female sexuality: biology versus culture, the language of sex, the diverse range of sexualities, reproduction and sexual pleasure, bodily representations - '\\"women\\" dressed as \\"men\\"' (p. 22) and the changing and challenging perspectives on Russian sexuality which have emerged since the advent of glasnost'. Russian literary, political and cultural texts from the 19th and 20th centuries, now familiar to many Western readers, are used to illustrate the variety of debates on these issues. They clearly illustrate that Russia has never been a 'sexless' society or 'uninterested in the erotic' (p. 37). 'The papers in this volume demonstrate that the \\"erotic questions\\" have always been present in the history of Russian culture, even when they have been most vehemently denied' (pp. 37-38). <br /> <br />The introduction also poses the question 'how does \\"Russian\\" sexuality differ from that of the \\"West\\"?' (pp. 4-8) and signals the importance of the overall theme of the individual chapters for contemporary rewritings and redrawings of Russian sexuality. Eve Levin argues in the first chapter that 'an understanding of how mediaeval Russian high culture viewed sexuality becomes a necessary first step for the analysis of sexuality in modern Russia' (p. 52). Most of the chapters which follow adopt an overtly feminist perspective in their analysis of such topics as puppet theatre, vanguard art, the ideological battlegrounds of reproduction and maternity and lesbian sexuality. <br /> <br />The authors do well to note some of the problems to which their own analysis gives rise. The very framework of their debates may be meaningless to many potential Russian readers. Diana Burgin, for example, points out that 'whatever contributions Lesbians have made to Russian feminism have either not been noted by historians or, more likely, are impossible to determine because Russian cultural norms and community standards strongly discouraged and continue to discourage any politics of the personal' (p. 178). In a more general analysis of personal politics, Helena Goscilo explores Tolstaya's rejection of the feminist label despite the fact that she offers 'a classic feminist critique of repressive patriarchal practices' and Goscilo proceeds to note that 'the stumbling block is less feminist theory or praxis per se than the label \\"feminist\\". Discredited by class associations in earlier phases of Soviet history and still rendered suspect by disillusionment with any comprehensive political agenda, the term \\"feminism\\" as entertained by Russians is culturally overmarked and consequently stigmatized' (p. 219). <br /> <br />The chapters are all very well documented and offer ample scope for further reading and research. Most of the contributors to this volume have also published extensively elsewhere and their chapters here, therefore, provide a useful introduction to some of the more extensive and related readings on the selected topics. This is probably not a book to be read directly from cover to cover and readers would be best advised to be selective in their choice of essays. It would also be an advantage to be prepared in advance in the theoretical and analytical writings which inform the ongoing debates in many of the chapters as these are not given a full explication in the text.	2005-10-03

Highly recommended. <br />-- <br />The gruff voice of Russia The Economist June 9, 1984 <br /> <br />Almost four years after his death, Vladimir Vysotsky remains a cult figure in Russia. His funeral, at the height of the Moscow Olympics in July, 1980, was private, but attracted thousands of mourners. Every year since then, on the anniversary of his death, crowds have flocked to the Vagankovskoye cemetery to play or listen to his songs. <br /> <br />Vysotsky was an actor at Moscow's avant-garde Taganka theatre. But it was his songs, sung to guitar accompaniment in the gruff voice of a heavy smoker and drinker, that endeared him to millions of Russians. Only a few of his most innocuous songs are available to them on records. A few of his less pungent lyrics are published in a small book. But his most popular songs circulate on unofficial tapes, which were recorded in the west or at private concerts in friends' homes, and copied many times. <br /> <br />Vysotsky's language is the Russian of the street. Many Russians believe -- wrongly -- that he spent time in jail. But he sang with great understanding for those who did. The hero of one of his best songs never lost his simple faith in Stalin, even when he ended up in a labour camp: instead of cursing the dictator, he tattooed his chest with his profile, \\"so that he would hear my heart beating\\". Then came the anti-Stalin thaw -- \\"it turned out I was branded in vain\\" -- and he sits in a steamy Russian bath-house hopelessly scrubbing at his tattoo, \\"the legacy of those dark times\\". <br /> <br />Vysotsky's other themes include the national disease of alcoholism, anti-Semitism, and the position of the individualist in Soviet society. His songs are gutsy and humorous. In one, people in a restaurant queue complain because dignitaries turn up and are admitted at once; in another, Falsity steals Truth's clothes; in others, Vysotsky satirises the ignorance of ordinary Russians about politics and the outside world. <br /> <br />Vysotsky died at the age of 42, but he left enough songs for his work to have been called an \\"encyclopaedia of Soviet life\\".	2005-10-02

The Economist May 27, 1978 <br /> <br />Ronald Hingley is the author of some dozen books on Russia and both editor and translator of the excellent Oxford edition of Chekhov. But few experts can combine, as he does, insight and empathy with a witty and often abrasive style, and very few indeed are so refreshingly open-minded. This book is a model of its kind because Mr Hingley asks far more questions, and those the right ones, than he supplies answers. <br /> <br />Every cliche has its mirror image. Are the Russians open-handed, generous and expansive - or secretive, evasive, untruthful? Are they congenitally idle and irresponsible, the comsumption of vodka rating as the number one national sport, or given to the robot-like pursuit of norms and the dialectic? Vocabulary can help: the panache, the emotionalism on which Russian pride themselves, razmakh , is a semantically loaded term. But then so are the gradations of untruthfulness, to which Mr Hingley devotes a splendid section, running the gamut from vranyo , the national cult of the tall story personified by Krushchev, to lozh , the more sinister manipulation of untruth exemplified by Stalin. <br /> <br />History adds a second dimension. Is the Russian acceptance of authority, even of the horrifyingly arbitrary authority of an Ivan the Terrible or a Stalin, an historically conditioned reflex? In what way does Soviet man differ from his pre-revolutionary equivalent? There is the even more important problem of Russia's relation to the west, in particular the way which this problem has so obsessed the Russians themselves. Western observers of Russia, the author notes, wanted information about the country. The Russians, by contrast, wanted recognition. <br /> <br />Which leads Mr Hingley to what is perhaps the central insight of this admirable book, the histrionic aspect of the Russian character. A nation of role-players, one might think, and here again vocabulary is relevant, for Mr Hingley argues - as he has argues elsewhere - that the Russians possess two different languages to express two polarised forms of behaviour, depending on whether private or public affairs are concerned. No wonder Dostoevsky, one of the many literary sources Mr Hingley uses as elegantly as he does unobtrusively, was to preoccupied by the theme of the \\"double\\".Alongside every fat man . . .?	2005-10-02

Perhaps that is why psychologist Roy Baumeister has chosen to describe rather than to define the central idea in Identity: Cultural Change and the Struggle for Self (Oxford University, $ 19.95). Identity, as Baumeister points out, is difficult to define, yet we all firmly believe we have one. And conceptual difficulties don't stop most of us from glibly discussing \\"identity crises' and \\"the self' as if these were concrete things. <br /> <br />Baumeister is on strongest ground when he examines identity from a historical vantage point. His clear discussion of the evolution of personal identity, from virtual nonexistence in the Middle Ages, through its gradualawakening during Renaissance, Romantic and Victorian times, to its place as a daily preoccupation in 1986, is convincing because it is well grounded in secondary historical sources. <br /> <br />Oddly, the book loses momentum when, in the last few chapters, the discussion turns to psychology. In the chapter on development of identity, for example, Baumeister ignores current ideas about the multiple bases of personality and fails even to mention psychoanalytic theory. Other passages concerning psychological topics, such as the chapter on brainwashing, have little or nothing to do with the lucid chapters on history that precede. <br /> <br />In his introduction, Baumeister acknowledges that the evidence for his arguments lies outside his own field of expertise. Unfortunately, so does his best writing.	2005-10-02

Reading this study of the plight of Soviet women after several years of Mr. Gorbachev's reformism is cause for wonder as to whether the liberation of women from second-class citizenship will be realized sooner in Kuwait than in the Soviet Union. Anyone who has read the recent book, \\"Soviet Women,\\" by Francine du Plessix Gray, knows that their plight is rooted deep in Russian culture. <br /> <br />Miss Atwood, a British-trained Sovietologist, concludes that the present socioeconomic climate will drive women back from their supposed emancipation under Bolshevism to the more traditional female role of homemaker. It is not easy to predict the capacity of a social system to change, but if there is one area of Soviet social development where little progress will occur, it is likely to be in the area of women's rights.	2005-10-02

He spares neither Whitehall mandarins, nor mendacious arms dealers, nor Israeli-sponsored think-tanks, nor wheeler-dealer CIA agents, nor well-tailored Arabs in London's \\"Beirut-on-Thames\\". Not even that perennial British favourite, \\"plucky little\\" King Hussein of Jordan, emerges unscathed. As if to clinch the point, the gruesome dustjacket shows two hands shaking, one smeared in oil, the other in blood.    Yet throughout its 360 exhaustive pages, A Brutal Friendship is informative, engrossing and entertaining. Aburish, a Palestinian writer whose book attacking the House of Saud established him as a leading Arab dissident, now extends his offensive to all \\"pro-West\\" regimes. His thesis seems obvious. Arab people deserve as much dignity and liberty as anyone else. For Aburish, this alone is the litmus test for a government's legitimacy. The \\"street\\", he implies, is always right, and whichever leader it adopts is therefore legitimate. Even bogey figures such as Saddam Hussein do better than King Fahd when it comes to spending on education or economic development.     Aburish accuses the West of moulding the Arab world to further its own interests, handpicking minority elements and criminals as leaders while denying Arab people their basic rights. From Britain encouraging the slaying of popular King Ghazi of Iraq in 1938 to the CIA instigating coup after coup in Syria, such interventions \\"almost became a bad habit\\". Then comes another, somewhat paradoxical argument: apart from being immoral, to mollycoddle dictators is to endanger long-term Western interests. Now that London has become \\"the new capital of the Middle East\\", Arab corruption has started \\"infecting the hosts\\" - witness Jonathan Aitken. And the Arab-Israeli peace process, Aburish warns, is doomed unless and until the parties heed the voices of ordinary people.    \\"Arming friends\\" - such as Britain's multi-billion weapons supply to Saudi Arabia - is equally short-sighted. The average Saudi soldier costs five times as much to maintain as his US equivalent, but poor training renders him useless in battle. The most obvious example is Saddam himself, who eventually bit the Western hand that had fed him with arms. Aburish unveils an entire hidden history of mendacity, as the CIA nurtured the young thug in the Sixties as their secret weapon against the anti-Western Iraqi leader Kassem.    Curiously enough, Western powers follow no Machiavellian master-plan, but rely on the improvisations of field officers and PR agents. Thus Britain's Harry Philby and the CIA's Miles Copeland could change history merely by exploiting personal ties with their Arab \\"pets\\". Given this accidental quality, Arab acquiescence seems all the more shameful.    Aburish may be quirky - having condemned \\"commission-skimming\\" arms-brokers, he suddenly reveals himself as one of their number - yet it is his keen eye for personal foibles, and the psychological background to political developments, which brings the book to life. His rogues' gallery includes \\"the gun-toting, whiskey-swigging, skirt-chasing\\" PLO agent, Hassan Ali Salameh; and the roving Orientalist, Gertrude Bell. She dined off the finest silverware in her desert tent and made blunder after blunder, yet created the State of Iraq from nothing. Meanwhile, Lebanese delegates to France wore an assortment of fezzes, baggy trousers, turbans and lounge suits to express their ethnic diversity, prompting Aburish to comment that \\"Prime Minister Clemenceau must have thought he was facing a collection of circus performers\\".    Aburish incisively queries received wisdom. For instance, King Hussein's historic peace \\"breakthrough\\" with Israel in 1994 merely concluded a process which began in secret decades earlier. Britain and the US may bewail the danger of Islamic fundamentalism, but it was they who nurtured the zealots in order to undermine Nasser's nationalists and his Soviet ally. And, in noting that Egypt's 1967 war against Israel coincided with her sponsorship of rebels in Saudi-backed Yemen, Aburish deduces: \\"Fighting Israel and Islam at the same time defeated Nasser and broke the back of the Arab nationalist movement.\\"    Too often, though, Aburish tries to shoehorn the facts to fit his thesis. He maintains that Maronites still run Lebanon - despite intracommunal murders, the disarmed militias and boycotted elections, the erosion of Christian presidential powers, and Syria's displacement of France as Lebanon's mentor. Likewise, Aburish wants to portray Arafat and King Hussein as archetypal Arab dictators. But what of Arafat's convincing electoral mandate in January 1996, or Hussein's own attempts, albeit halting, to introduce multi-party democracy in his kingdom?    Two nagging questions remain. Are Arab governments illegitimate because they are in cahoots with a corrupting West; or is the West corrupt because it is in cahoots with illegitimate governments? Aburish's answer seems to be: guilty on both counts.    Accepting that A Brutal Friendship is polemic, we can learn much about the Middle East from it - and enjoy a good read. Aburish is either brave or foolhardy (perhaps a bit of both). (...)    ---    A Brutal Friendship: The West and the Arab Elite; book reviews Commentary September, 1998    \\"There are no legitimate regimes in the Arab Middle East.\\" With this eye-opening first line, Said Aburish, an independent-minded Palestinian writer long resident in London, promises something fresh: an insider's expose of the tyrannical governments that dominate his region. Aburish is, indeed, in a good position to document a sordid political history that harks back to World War I, and he is also no stranger to the form: his previous book, The Rise, Corruption and Coming Fall of the House of Saud (1994), was an important if over-the-top denunciation of the Saudi ruling family.     In A Brutal Friendship, Aburish sets out to deliver on his promise by offering biting assessments of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, plus Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority. But, alas, his indictment is brief and superficial, consisting mostly of criticisms of the region's rulers for not following their real interests. And that sets the stage for Aburish's true topic, which is to find a scapegoat for this dismal state of affairs.    Here, to put it charitably, he is less than enlightening. His explanation for Arab tyranny dwells not on the foibles of culture in Arabic-speaking countries; not on their premodern legacy of dictatorship; and not on the winner-take-all atmosphere that dominates their politics. In fact, Aburish has almost nothing to say about the motor forces of Arab life; his attention is focused outward.    What emerges from Aburish's pages, in a nutshell, is that nearly all the problems of the Middle East are due to a vast British and American conspiracy that aims to perpetuate \\"Western political hegemony\\" in the regime. The British and American governments are not alone in pursuing their greedy goals; oil companies, too, are complicit, and are blamed by Aburish for, in particular, the \\"moral degradation\\" of Arab leaders. As for the citizens of Western countries, they have been too thoroughly brainwashed to resist the corrupt imperialism of their rulers. The only Westerners identified by Aburish as seeing through the vast deception are Noam Chomsky and Edward Said, two stars in the firmament of the conspiracist Left.    In pursuit of its aims, the West does not rely on anything so crude or transparent as direct rule. Instead, writes Aburish, the Anglo powers get Arab stooges to do their work for them, teaching them how to \\"suppress their people to stay in power and use their control of their countries to provide a stability which serves Western political and economic interests.\\" By this means, generations of Arab elites have become nothing more than \\"deputy sheriffs,\\" or, more pungently, the losing partners in a \\"master-slave relationship.\\"    Blaming the West leads Aburish into some strange byways. In order to differentiate among Arab leaders, for instance, he constructs a topsy-turvy moral calculus. Those who have explicitly aligned themselves with the West--King Hussein of Jordan, various Egyptian governments, and the like--he castigates as \\"hideous\\" and \\"abominable\\"; even Yasir Arafat is put down as \\"a tool\\" of Western power. By contrast, Saddam Hussein is praised for his \\"eradication of illiteracy, his health-care programs, and his championing of women's rights,\\" while the fundamentalist Muslim movements are designated the Arabs' one remaining hope. As for Israel, that country. all but disappears from the Middle East picture as Aburish draws it. However much he may loathe the Jewish state, he sees it as only another client of the West and therefore not a power in its own right.    To anyone not versed in matters Middle Eastern, the extremist bent of A Brutal Friendship might make it seem like the slightly deranged musings of one out-of-touch intellectual. Unhappily, its outlook cannot be so easily dismissed. Outlandish as it may be, the book represents a main line of Arab thinking, one that (as Fouad Ajami has noted in his recent book, The Dream Palace of the Arabs, which I reviewed in the March 1998 Commentary) is embraced as well by any number of leading politicians, military officers, religious authorities, journalists, and academics.

The cops love these free-wheeling, elite units. They were ostensibly created to combat terrorism, but have been used mostly to infiltrate and suppress liberal and radical political organizations and civil rights groups. They lift their members out of the routine of police work into something of a James Bond life. As Frank Donner points out in this excellently researched, thoughtful and well-detailed study of police spying, their excesses have been many. But Donner, who directed the American Civil Liberties Project on Political Surveillance, concludes with the chilling thought that the Red squads will be around long after there are any Reds.  <br /> <br />Why wouldn't the police like them? The elite Red squads work on their own, usually reporting directly to the chief, operating outside normal department procedures. That's dangerous. Even worse, the squads are concerned more with political attitudes than with crime. <br /> <br />Their targets are chosen according to the narrow, conservative political views of the police and usually are selected in a Keystone Cop fashion. Among the Los Angeles Public Disorder and Intelligence Division (PDID) targets, for example, was the organization advocating help for Soviet Jewry. This was an anti-Kremlin movement, but the intricacies of that obviously were too much for the PDID. <br /> <br />Worse yet, the information, and misinformation, gathered by these sleuths is fed into the growing number of intelligence networks maintained by federal, state and local law-enforcement organizations. In the computer age, if you attend a left-wing meeting in Echo Park, your name is likely to be spread as far as New York. <br /> <br />As Donner points out, the squads are not a recent invention. One of his most important contributions is tracing the history of the Red squads, showing how deeply rooted they are in American political, social and economic life.... <br /> <br />...That set the pattern for the Red squads, a pattern that continues today. Whatever the city, said Donner, the goal and tactics are much the same: \\"police behavior motivated or influenced in whole or in part by hostility to protest, dissent and related activities perceived as a threat to the status quo.\\" <br /> <br />...You might ask what's wrong with this. Don't the police need a way of detecting domestic terrorism? If somebody is going to blast the bank down the street -- or my newspaper office -- shouldn't the police be able to prevent it? <br /> <br />Of course they should. And failing to deal with that point is the book's weakness. The answer -- and I would have liked to have heard this from Donner -- is that law enforcement already has that capability through line officers investigating all sorts of crime. They're regular cops, subject to department oversight and discipline. Treat threats of terrorism the same way as threats of bank robberies, with the investigators subject to the same control -- civilian and uniformed -- as any other detectives. Demystify intelligence gathering. <br /> <br />Another weakness is the writing. Donner makes hard reading of a fascinating story that features famous exponents of nightstick justice, such as Red Hynes and Philadelphia's Frank Rizzo. <br /> <br />For that reason, this is a book for the experts, the scholars, attorneys, activists, journalists and others who have to deal with the Red squads. <br /> <br />And certainly it's a must for police academies, especially the LAPD's. <br /> <br />---- <br />Book review by The New York Times, February 2, 1991 <br /> <br />... the roots of repression in this country, and the role played by city police departments in silencing political dissent, are overlooked in the history books.  <br /> <br />Frank Donner fills the gap in \\"Protectors of Privilege.\\" His documented evidence stands in contrast to the secret accusations and invasions of privacy that characterize some urban police department dossiers. Mr. Donner, a lawyer and the director of the American Civil Liberties Project on Political Surveillance, has argued labor and constitutional cases before the Supreme Court. His new study of abuses by the cities complements his previous book, \\"The Age of Surveillance,\\" which covered political intelligence on the Federal level. <br /> <br />Beginning in the last half of the 19th century, the repressive activities by urban police concentrated on demonstrations, mass meetings, rallies, picketing and parades. The tactics used by the police in response to the exercise of the constitutional right of peaceable assembly have included dragnet and pretext arrests, use of force or the threat of force, indiscriminate clubbings and mounted charges... <br /> <br />...About New York, Mr. Donner writes, \\"In contrast to the Chicago unit's wide-open, Dodge City style, its scorn for the law it was supposed to uphold, a claim to professionalism dominates the self-image of the New York City red squad (BOSS, as it has commonly been called, an acronym for its formal title, the Bureau of Special Services).\\" BOSS agents used cameras and video equipment for open surveillance of demonstrations. In the 1960's, it was also a common practice for detectives to flash fake press cards for undercover photography. <br /> <br />As a result of court decisions, the author says, the unit's \\"most objectionable practices\\" were stopped. But he does not venture a guess on the extent of BOSS's activities in New York today. Other cities covered in \\"Protectors of Privilege\\" include Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, Baltimore, Birmingham, Ala., New Haven and Washington. <br /> <br />Mr. Donner warns that police surveillance and dossiers require constant vigilance and that what took place crudely with clubs in the past may be revived quietly with computers and less traceable surveillance technology... <br /> <br />--- <br />Book Review: The Nation March 11, 1991 <br /> <br />...Protectors of Privilege is the central panel in a triptych of domestic totalitarianism, painstakingly crafted by Donner over the past thirty years. The Un-Americans chronicled the nation's most loathsome inquisition and offered a sort of inverse hagiography of the inquisitors themselves. In 1980 came The Age of Surveillance, Donner's meticulously detailed account of the government's massive campaign of political snooping and harassment from the early red scares through the Nixon years. <br /> <br />Donner's purpose in Protectors of Privilege is deceptively simple: to describe the ways municipal police forces have monitored and muzzled dissent for over 100 years. It's subject of far broader significance than is suggested by the clucking criticism of red squads that generally surfaces from reform quarters. America's red squads are not just the regrettable but fundamentally inconsequential abuses of overweening cops. Red squads kill. That's been true from the hanging of the Haymarket martyrs in 1887 through the murder of Black Panther Fred Hampton by Chicago police in 1969 through the deaths of five children and six adults in Philadelphia's bombing of MOVE in 1985. And what's more, these elite police units have had a profound effect on politics in America's cities. <br /> <br />Nearly every major city had (and many no doubt still have) a red squad with decades of spying, harassment and intimidation behind it. And each of those red squads had its own local quirks and wrinkles. Thus in Chicago in the 1960s, police were partial to collaborating with private-sector snoops from corporations like I.T.T., along with the F.B.I. and C.I.A.; in my own city, New Haven, the prurient obsessions of police officers inspired a years-long wiretap campaign of almost inconceivable scope, drawing into its auditory net thousands of individuals and organizations, from radical feminists to the local movie house. <br /> <br />But there's far more to Donner's account than regurgitation of news stories and court testimony. In The Age of Surveillance, he explained why the political intelligence establishment has such staying power. Its roots lie, he said, in \\"a nativist anti-radicalism.\\" Then he went on: <br /> <br />Nativism is fear-centered, nourished by the twin myths . . . of an all-powerful internal subversive enemy and a permanently endangered national security, which deny vitality to the protected freedoms. . . .It has been sustained by a passionate tribal constituency, which seeks to implement its suppressive commitment at the decision- and policy-making levels of government.... <br /> <br />Though the red squads soon took on a life of their own, that open alliance with industry-\\"the Bargain,\\" Donner calls it - continued down to our own time. In the 1960s and 1970s in Detroit, for instance, Chrysler \\"provided the red squad . . . with information from its voluminous files concerning the political activities of workers. . . .In return, the police provided Chrysler with membership lists of allegedly subversive organizations and in some cases recommended the firing of activist employees.\\" As recently as 1979, the Bargain was reiterated by the head of Philadelphia's Chamber of Commerce, who told the Federal Civil Rights Commission that \\"most businessmen . . . feel that police protection is so good that they are willing to put up with instances which, if they happened in their own family, would be intolerable.\\" <br /> <br />The recent political history of America's cities can't be understood without taking into account the red squads.  <br /> <br />...Donner is most impressive and original when carefully charting the shifts in police attitudes toward dissent-shifts rooted in an evolving climate of paranoia. In the late nineteenth century, he suggests, even the most extreme police officials envisioned their jobs as simply the protection of industry, and more broadly the preservation of public order. If intimidating radicals was the way to do it, then that's what they did.But by the early twentieth century, the purpose had changed considerably: \\"Clandestine surveillance . . . in particular discrete situations evolved into (intelligence' work focused on ongoing involvement with targets, not as an investigative means to a decision-making end, its blueprinted purpose, but as a (punitive) end in itself.\\" The search for enemies, too, became an end in itself, utterly divorced from reality. Thus in the 1960s, police \\"insisted that evil plotters . . . were the source of ghetto unrest.\\" This obsession with conspiracy, Donner notes, did not arise in a vacuum: HUAC, McCarthy and other Congressional investigators granted the police ever-broader definitions of subversion. \\"The transition from behavior to ideology, from suppression of violence to curbing peaceful dissent, was thus completed; the new, enormously expanded police mission was legitimated by our countersubversive political culture, which in turn was enriched by police contributions to its fear-based assumptions.\\" <br /> <br />Donner opens more questions than he can properly answer. I'd like to learn more, for instance, about the connection between red squads and antivice crusades. It's a connection that appears over and over in the history of the rad-hunters. The nineteenth-century rise of the red squads occurred in an era of antivice efforts. Many recent antisubversive police campaigns, like New Haven's wiretap operation, were initially aimed at illegal gambling and other sins. Philadelphia's Mayor Rizzo earned his fame as a vice cop and Los Angeles police chief Parker believed that communism and vice were the twin scourges of American life... <br /> <br />...Donner lays the decline of the red squads at the feet of a shifting public mood in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. He may be right. But that decline also coincides with the flight of major industry from the cities; perhaps the red squads simply ran out of privilege to protect. And it's a telling tribute to the political strength of the nation's permanent government that red squads and the F.B.I. have proved considerably harder to rein in than HUAC and similar legislative. efforts. <br /> <br />When Donner began his investigation, he could not have foreseen the worldwide evaporation of the Red Menace or the Persian Gulf war. But recent events raise an inevitable question: Since the century-old fear of world communism has ended but dissent has not, what shape will America's future red squads take? Donner himself points to the resurgence of private-sector snoops: It's a development that harks back to the days of Haymarket, when private Pinkertons were industry's first line of defense against labor agitation. <br /> <br />And what about enemies? Of course the gulf war has resurrected that favorite inspirational figure for red squads, the Fanatical Foreigner. Today's nativists can also point to such \\"outsiders\\" as lesbian and gay activists in groups like ACT UP. And then there's the war on drugs: With gunplay-prone crack dealers feeding fears of both violence and social decay, police forces in a number of cities of cities have revived intelligence squads buried in the 1970s. In New Haven, a police intelligence squad formed last year to combat drug gangs showed up with a video camera at a recent antiwar rally. <br />-- <br />Monthly Review November, 1991 <br /> <br />Perhaps the central irony in Frank Donner's new book about the political repression practiced by urban police forces revolves around the word \\"terrorism.\\" Touting their activities as necessary to protect American society against the vaguely defined forces of terrorism, the nation's red squads have routinely practiced that which they supposedly guard us against. They use violence and intimidation against their political enemies with a ruthlessness and flagrant disregard of legality that is all the more terrifying because it is done in the name of the law... <br /> <br />...Opportunism explains only part of the picture. Though bureaucratically aggressive red squads hyped the dangers of urban unrest to justify increased allocations, they also believed in their work. The ideology that governed their activities determined their choice of targets. Most of them were the expected ones--peace activists, student radicals, and, above all, black militants. Cultural antagonism, Donner believes, accounts for the brutality of the crackdown on such groups and individuals. <br /> <br />Still, the inclusion of such innocuous organizations as the Chicago chapter of the League of Women Voters suggests that the process got out of control--and not just in the Windy City. There is, however, an underlying rationality in the seemingly indiscriminate choice of targets. By identifying themselves as the guardians of order, local police forces came to view all of their critics, no matter how law-abiding, as a threat to that order. Self-protection became as much a part of their mission as traffic control. As a result, the red squads came to devote considerable resources to harassing those organizations and individuals that opposed illegal police activities. <br /> <br />In the process, law enforcement received a much lower priority than the disruption of dissent. Surveillance, widespread though it was, prevented few if any crimes. The urban riots of the late 1960s caught local police departments completely unprepared. In those cases where red squad surveillance did provide advance warning, as, for example, with both the 1969 SDS Days of Rage and the Black Panther murder of Alex Rackley in New Haven, the police did not intervene. Nor was the surveillance of radicals any more productive after the fact; red squad investigations involved so many illegalities that most prosecutions based upon them were thrown out of court. <br /> <br />In any event, law enforcement was not the name of the game. The maintenance of order, in the intolerant manner in which the red squads defined it, was. During the 1960s and early 1970s, maintaining order meant repressing dissent through the intertwined techniques of surveillance and disruption. Although much of the surveillance was under cover, much--like the ubiquitous police photographers at demonstrations--was overt and expressly designed to intimidate. Red squad activists enjoyed discomfiting their targets by addressing them by name at demonstrations. Pretext arrests combined harassment with information gathering and, at least in Philadelphia, may well have been devised to trigger violence. Wiretaps, burglaries, and other covert operations were routine, though illegal. Even in a city with a liberal administration, like New Haven  in the 1960s, the police wiretapped over a thousand people. <br /> <br />Informers were ubiquitous, by far the most widely used method of surveillance and disruption. Not only did they provide material for the files, but as agents provocateurs they encouraged the groups they infiltrated to undertake exactly those illegal and provocative activities that would justify the continuing police attention to them. Undercover agents found that their supervisors expected them to turn in lurid reports and the more compliant informers often produced them, even if they had to propose the operations themselves. This was the case, for example, in New York where eager police agents within the Black Panther Party planned bombings and then supplied material for them. Equally important were the activities of undercover agents in sabotaging their organizations' legitimate work. <br /> <br />Police departments recruited both professional and civilian informers. The numbers are unknown, but may well have reached five figures. By the late 1060s there were over two thousand professional and amateur spies in Chicago alone. For regular police officers, undercover work was a rapid route to advancement. Some civilians enlisted for patriotic reasons, others were police groupies who hoped that working with the red squad might get them a job with the force. In Philadelphia policemen's wives became \\"pin money\\" spies. The activities of these informers varied. Some took on single assignments; others, like Chicago veteran Sheli Lulkin, who infiltrated eighty-eight separate organizations, made it a career. <br /> <br />All of these police activities--overt and concealed--were clearly designed to destroy the targeted organizations. In some cities, notably Philadelphia, which experienced a virtual reign of police terror under Frank Rizzo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the harassment blossomed into a full-scale physical attack on all dissent. Elsewhere, the use of violence was a bit more discriminating: it targeted the Black Panthers. And it was successful. Though Donner does not try to assess the extent to which this repression contributed to the decline of the radical left in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the scope of red squad activism, as well as the self-defeating paranoia that it understandably encouraged within the left, could not but have made a massive contribution to the demise of the movement. <br /> <br />By the late 1970s, many of the red squad abuses were themselves under attack. In the post-Watergate backlash against illegal government activities, there were attempts to curb local red squads. Legislative investigations and litigation revealed the extent of the police lawbreaking and produced legislation or legal settlements that required the destruction of files and the imposition of restrictive guidelines. Even so, many of the abuses persisted. Police departments often ignored the new regulations. They lied and stonewalled when pressed about their failure to destroy files and their continuing surveillance of legal dissent. Moreover, as the judicial and political climate turned conservative, even the limited constraints on the lawlessness of the law of the late 1970s became hard to enforce. <br /> <br />The most effective constraint against police misbehavior seems to be financial. When socked with massive awards for damages, local politicians do try to keep their cops in line. But the main victims of police repression rarely sue. As the recent police brutality cases in New York and Los Angeles reveal, the most serious violations of individuals' civil liberties may well stem from the day-to-day racism of the ordinary police, not the more specialized activities of local red squads. Race is too central to the American polity to exclude the routine harassment of African-Americans from an account of urban police repression. Since Donner is hardly optimistic about the changes of curbing illegal police behavior, when we expand our definition of the nature police behavior, when we expand our definition of the nature of that repression beyond the assault on political and cultural dissidents that Donner charts, the prospect is even grimmer. Still, thanks to Donner's work, we can at least recognize the enemy. <br /> <br />Ellen W.

He begins in 1965, when President Johnson crafted public messages as he sent troops to the Dominican Republic. Solomon claims that LBJ's handling of this invasion established the prototype for a media agenda employed by subsequent presidents to create public approval for their actions. He finds several formulaic messages that help persuade the public to support military intervention. These include portraying America as a fair and noble superpower, whose honest leaders work hard to avoid war, and the enemy leader as an aggressive, [...]-like violator of human rights who will do much harm unless the United States intervenes. Solomon's timely analysis, which continues through the current war in Iraq, provides the public, analysts, and journalists with useful tips on how to evaluate the prewar messages of any administration, current or historical.     --  Harsh insight into how we make war  Los Angeles Times June 29, 2005 Wednesday    Does the unspooling Iraq saga fill you with a disquieting sense of deja vu? Feel like you've been there, done that, been lied to and spun in this manner somewhere else, at some other point in time? Well, that's because you have.    Norman Solomon, a longtime media critic, lays out the elaborate hustle in his new book, \\"War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death.\\" It's all there -- Vietnam, the invasions of Panama and Grenada, the first Gulf War and more. (Including a first chapter about the 1965 U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic, an unfortunately labored and obscure choice to lead off an otherwise compelling read.)     The villains are the government and the media: the government because time and again it remorselessly falsifies the reality ofwar, and the media because major press and broadcast outlets can't seem to wriggle free from self-interest long enough to speak truth to power.    Solomon offers 16 brutally persuasive chapters, each centered on a perennial falsehood, such as \\"If This War Is Wrong, Congress Will Stop It,\\" \\"This Is About Human Rights\\" and \\"This Is Not at All About Oil or Corporate Profits.\\"    One insidious whopper -- that American war leaders always yearn for peace -- runs counter to such evidence as the Nixon tapes, in which the president, who publicly expressed concern about the Indochina carnage, is caught on the White House recording system discussing with Henry A. Kissinger an extension of the bombing to new targets in North Vietnam:    Nixon: \\"I still think we ought to take the [...] out.... Will that drown people?\\"    Kissinger: \\"About 200,000 people.\\"    Nixon: \\"No, no, no.... I'd rather use the nuclear bomb.... I just want you to think big, Henry, for Christ's sakes.\\"    The belief that the media will remain vigilant to government misconduct in times of war is belied by an internal MSNBC report cited by Solomon, which explains why Phil Donahue's show (with which Solomon was associated) was canceled shortly before the Iraq invasion. Keeping Donahue on the air, says one MSNBC executive, would \\"present a difficult public face for NBC in a time of war ... [and become] a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.\\" Solomon also notes that less than 1% of the sources featured on CBS' \\"Evening News\\" during the Iraq War's first three weeks could be considered \\"antiwar.\\"    For sheer chutzpah, nothing tops the story of U.S. troops during the 1989 invasion of Panama seizing a huge cache of dictator and former U.S. ally Manuel Noriega's cocaine. Well after the event, the military was forced to admit that the reported stash was actually tamales wrapped in banana leaves. This was followed by the military's claim that Noriega had used the stash for \\"unspeakable acts of witchcraft and voodoo.\\"    Solomon is most outraged by what he sees as the utter disconnect between Americans and the true horror of wars carried out in their name and with their approval. He cites James Baldwin on denial, on \\"the [...] and expedient nature of the American innocence which has always been able to persuade itself that it does not know what it knows too well.\\"    And Solomon adds, \\"Aren't we at least dimly aware that -- no matter how smooth and easy the news media and elected officials try to make it for us -- in faraway places there are people not so different than us who are being destroyed by what journalists and politicians glibly depict as necessary war?\\"    \\"War Made Easy\\" is largely an amalgam of material from others' books, speeches and articles. But Solomon is a formidable thinker and activist in his own right. He traveled with Sean Penn to Iraq shortly before the invasion, and one wishes he had shared more of his considerable experiences in the media trenches.    Solomon's voice, when he gives it full throat, is appropriately sardonic. Here he comments on a USA Today headline from June 2004, about the incoming Iraqi prime minister's support for the U.S.: \\"The banner headline was a classic of occupation puppetry and media gimmicky,\\" Solomon writes, noting that Iyad Allawi was long close to the CIA but a virtual stranger to the Iraqi people. \\"All in all, by Washington's lights, the man was eminently qualified to be Iraq's 'new leader.' And his superb judgment was immediately apparent: 'New Leader Asks U.S. to Stay'! \\"    \\"War Made Easy\\" is a must-read for those who would like greater context with their bitter morning coffee, or to arm themselves for the debates about Iraq that are still to come.    Solomon cites a 2003 Los Angeles Times article, in which top Pentagon officials \\"are studying the lessons of Iraq closely -- to ensure that the next U.S. takeover of a foreign country goes more smoothly.\\" Says a top assistant to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld: \\"We'll get better as we do it more often.\\"    Russ Baker [...] is a contributing editor to the Columbia Journalism Review and founder of a new nonprofit, the Real News Project, dedicated to investigative journalism.	2005-09-23

Nation readers will remember Donner's great books on U.S. political repression, The Age of Surveillance and Protectors of Privilege. On this occasion, however, our conversation turned to Frank's work as an attorney thirty years before, when he had defended dozens of people in McCarthy-era subversion cases. Donner had the animated face of a Jewish Benjamin Franklin. His voice always sounded a half-tone sharp of the prevailing conversational pitch, and he was imbued with a combative, cheerfully anti-authoritarian spirit. But as the nitty-gritty of his work in the fifties emerged from the recesses of memory, Frank's voice lowered to a hoarse mutter, the flesh of his face grew heavy and he lapsed into gloomy rumination: about clients overcome by paranoia; about the burden of learning that a Communist Party committee in Ohio had beaten a member falsely accused of informing; about the F.B.I.'s harassment of Frank's own family and neighbors. These were hardly conventional courtroom war stories. <br /> <br />Most of the attorneys who shouldered the unprecedented professional burden imposed by the anti-Communist purge are now dead, Donner among them. Few now remember that they were a diverse lot--labor lawyers and Communist Party members, white-shoe corporate practitioners, distinguished academics--or that for most of them the loyalty cases turned out to be a messy, life-defining business. Even institutional memory is at risk of being lost: Early this year, the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, established to aid these lawyers when the A.C.L.U. succumbed to the era's hysteria, passed out of independent existence, merging with the larger Center for Constitutional Rights in New York City. <br /> <br />Two books published over the past two years--a family biography centered on liberal California celebrity lawyer Bartley Crum by his daughter Patricia Bosworth, and the memoir of left-wing paladin Victor Rabinowitz--begin the important excavation of these lawyers' stories. Reviewers have focused on each book's larger story: Bosworth's is a sometimes excruciating chronicle of an imploding upper-class family, Rabinowitz's is a saga of a half-century of activist lawyering. But loyalty cases are the linchpins upon which both men's lives and careers turned. <br /> <br />Many people remember Joseph Welch's \\"have you no decency\\" denunciation of Joe McCarthy. But Rabinowitz tells a story that's probably more representative of loyalty-case lawyering. The occasion was one of McCarthy's hearings at the Army Signal Corps in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, around 1953. A distraught woman approached Rabinowitz outside the hearing room. A single mother and, it seems, a party member, Sylvia worked as a clerk for the local board of education but had been formerly employed at the Signal Corps. If compelled to testify, she would lose her public school desk job. Rabinowitz took Sylvia's case on the spot. <br /> <br />I waited in the hall to catch McCarthy as <br /> <br />he came up in the elevator, and a few <br /> <br />minutes before ten o'clock he stepped out <br /> <br />of an elevator car, saw me ... threw his <br /> <br />arms around me shouting, \\"Hello Vic! <br /> <br />What can I do for you?\\" There were <br /> <br />about fifty people in the hall, and I did <br /> <br />not relish the greeting. <br /> <br />Keeping a lid on his repulsion, Rabinowitz asked McCarthy to excuse Sylvia from testifying. \\"I pointed out that it seemed unnecessarily cruel to this young woman to deprive her of employment.\\" Sure, said McCarthy--just check with his chief counsel, Roy Cohn. Cohn, true to form, said no. The genial McCarthy proceeded to shred Sylvia in the hearing; she lost her job the next day. <br /> <br />By disposition and training, lawyers are essentially believers in the system. The attorneys at the top of their game in the fifties, even Marxists like Rabinowitz, had earlier found special ratification for that inclination in the New Deal. So cases like Sylvia's represented a rude awakening. And the unique pressures of ended loyalty cases--the fractious fights between C.P.ers and liberals, the constant F.B.I. surveillance, the likelihood that attorneys themselves would be subpoenaed by the same investigating committees as their clients--could leave even high-powered lawyers feeling unmoored. Some, like Rabinowitz, were so outraged by the sustained cynicism of the inquisitors that they became outriders of sixties radicalism. On the other hand, at least a few were left crushed in livelihood and spirit--among them Bartley Crum, one of the most prominent members of the Hollywood Ten's \\"dream team\\" in 1947, who would spend the next decade yanked back and forth between the poles of principled resistance and humiliating capitulation. <br /> <br />Both Rabinowitz and Crum arrived at their encounters with the inquisition through the National Lawyers Guild, founded in 193 7 as a progressive, pro-labor alternative to the American Bar Association. Except for the guild, though, their careers could not have been more different. Rabinowitz is, at 87, one of the few survivors of that era still practicing law. Moved by a short story by Albert Maltz (later one of the Hollywood Ten), Rabinowitz had steered himself into labor law, joining the Communist Party in 1942. In a few years, he and Leonard Boudin founded what remains the nation's leading progressive law firm, today known as Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman. <br /> <br />Unrepentant Leftist is an unapologetic recollection of movements and clients. Rabinowitz is blunt in his motivation for joining the party (he was \\"more interested in works than faith\\"), equally unambiguous about his differences with party policy in the postwar years and his reasons for leaving in 1960. He recounts his firm's long representation of Cuba, the ups and downs of the guild, his efforts on behalf of the civilrights movement in the South (among his clients, his daughter Joni, tried in Georgia on a trumped-up perjury charge). With great dignity he describes the arduous job of aiding in the representation of his partner Boudin's daughter Kathy, who, after eleven years as a Weather Underground fugitive, was arrested in 1981 for murder in a Brink's robbery in Nyack, New York. Through all of this Rabinowitz comes across as a stand-up guy, as Abbie Hoffman defined it: the Tony Curtis character who, when the Roman centurion comes for Kirk Douglas, rises to declare, \\"I am Spartacus.\\" <br /> <br />Rabinowitz was witness to the first chapter of the purge. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Labor Act to regulate union organizing. Taft-Hartley's section 9(h) required officers of unions certified by the National Labor Relations Board to make sworn declarations that they were not members of the Communist Party. A Rabinowitz client, the American Communications Association, was closely aligned with the C.P. and, when its officers could not sign the requisite oath, was duly decertified. Various federal judges upheld the decertification. Rabinowitz tried to convince the union and party leadership to swallow their loss: He feared an adverse Supreme Court ruling would set a broader and more dangerous precedent. The party hierarchy insisted on an appeal, but Rabinowitz turned out to be right. In American Communications Association v. Douds, the Court ruled that protecting \\"the free flow of commerce\\" from crippling strikes favored by C.P. strategists trumped First Amendment rights. It was the first national test of a blanket ban on Communists in trade unions, and it unleashed a flood of anti-subversive legislation aimed at other sectors. <br /> <br />At first, the anti-Communist panic was actually good for the firm's business. But soon the professional cost was clear. Many individual clients could not afford to pay, and heavily Communist unions like the United Electrical Workers weregoing broke defending themselves. The firm's largest and most reliable client, the Health Care and Hospital Workers Union-District 65, abruptly decided it needed lawyers without Rabinowitz-Boudin's red taint. Rabinowitz himself was called to testify before Senator James Eastland's Internal Security Subcommittee, and had to block Eastland's investigators physically from seizing his client files. <br /> <br />With exceptional candor, Rabinowitz illuminates, in new and often unflattering ways, the role played by the Communist Party hierarchy--the flight underground of C.P. leaders indicted under the Smith Act, for instance, which he correctly viewed as the sheerest folly. Equally enlightening are his accounts of debates with other party lawyers on how to handle investigators' subpoenas--arguments between \\"First Amendment Communists\\" wanting to defy the committees' right to ask any questions at all, and Fifth Amendment Communists wanting to protect themselves with the established right to non-incrimination. In the short run the so-called First Amendment Communists lost out, especially after citations of the Hollywood Ten for contempt; most witnesses claimed the Fifth. But in the long run, repeated invocations of the Fifth Amendment under the glare of klieg lights helped convince the public that dissenters really were conspiratorial criminals. It would take more than a decade before Rabinowitz, Donner and other lawyers could chip away substantially at the inquisition's reach, one contempt citation, one passport denial at a time. <br /> <br />Communist Party strategists come in for a lot of knocks in Bart Crum's biography, too, though from a different perspective. Where Rabinowitz complains that the party sometimes insisted on hiring establishment lawyers like Crum at the expense of political practitioners' greater expertise, Crum, working on the Hollywood Ten case for producer Adrian Scott and director Edward Dmytryk, was in precisely the opposite position: locked out ofkey meetings and decisions. <br /> <br />Crum desperately wanted to be a standup guy, but through a combination of personal failings and the ravages of blackmail, he ended up with a chronic case of liberal staggers. Prior to 1947 he'd combined a lucrative career as retainer to the likes of William Randolph Hearst with forays into reform politics. Self-aggrandizing, fiscally profligate and publicity-addicted, he attached himself temporarily to lost causes: the doomed 1940 presidential campaign of reform Republican Wendell Willkie; the pioneering but equally doomed newspaper PM, which he tried, disastrously, to salvage from bankruptcy. Another lost cause was his family. Patricia Bosworth's book filters her father's public career through an intimate life of considerable privilege but greater pain. I'll skip over Bosworth's recounting of the details, except to say that her father's appealing public persona, his idealism and restless energy, are as apparent as his horrifying self-indulgence. <br /> <br />By 1947, Crum's attachment to Popular Front causes--ranging from Jewish resettlement in Palestine to the Progressive Citizens Association--had attracted the scrutiny of J. Edgar Hoover. Then came the Hollywood Ten. From the beginning, Crum found himself at odds with orthodox party lawyers on the team. \\"My father felt uncomfortable with the Party's secrecy,\\" Bosworth writes. \\"He would joke and flatter to make a point, tactics the Communists didn't appreciate at all... In the midst of one discussion my father suggested everybody simply tell the truth.\\" His clients Scott and Dmytryk agreed, but were outvoted when party lawyer Ben Margolis and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo argued that to answer questions at all would acknowledge HUAC's right to ask. Worse, Crum learned that party lawyers had held a separate, secret caucus about tactics. Despite Crum's professional prominence, he was ill equipped for the blacklist's political complexity. \\"You have no cunning in your face, Bartley Crum,\\" Bertolt Brecht said to him one day, shortly before the martyrdom-averse Brecht told a boldfaced lie to HUAC about his political affiliations and then packed his bags for East Germany. <br /> <br />Still, Crum took on other loyalty cases--California teachers and unionists mostly, meeting them late at night in bars to avoid attracting attention. Rather than directly challenge the inquisition, his strategy was to \\"protect the client from making rash statements ... to sound 'hostile' to Communism.\\" It's not clear whether this \\"establishment\\" strategy paid off for his clients. It certainly did not protect Crum from the F.B.I.: \\"Most certainly a Communist or a hidden Communist,\\" his file says. \\"Always refers to himself as a Catholic or Republican; obviously a double alibi.\\" Nor did it shield his family from being ostracized in their affluent, conservative social set. <br /> <br />Crum couldn't quite make up his mind where his commitments lay. Sometime in 1948, he stopped handling loyalty cases because \\"his more conservative clients disapproved.\\" Yet that same year he moved to New York as new publisher of the failing PM, which he renamed the New York Star. Endlessly red-baited and hopelessly undercapitalized, the paper was out of business in a year, and a few weeks later Crum attempted suicide. By the end of 1950, Crum had resigned from the National Lawyers Guild to look \\"less subversive.\\" At the same time his client Dmytryk broke with the Hollywood Ten to testify about his own activities. Most of the Ten blamed Bart. <br /> <br />These conflicting pressures reached critical mass in the spring of 1953: In a restaurant with his family, he was suddenly called to the phone. Hoover was on the line, warning Crum his passport would be revoked unless he went to Washington to answer some questions. Crum provided a dirt-eating written statement: \\"I am a practicing Catholic. My religious and political views are not and have never been compatible with Communism or Socialism.\\" That's what he told his family, gradually adopting a defensive bitterness toward the C.P. What Crum didn't say is that he also agreed to provide the F.B.I. with information about the Lawyers Guild and two of his colleagues. <br /> <br />In the short run, Crum's strategy worked: His passport was renewed. But the process seemed to collapse his internal system of meaning; he had no Rabinowitz-like compass to restore stability to his life. He'd already come to rely on alcohol and barbiturates. His son Bart Jr. committed suicide. Over the next few years \\"his career fell into a shambles,\\" notes Bosworth. Crum only re-emerged in the public eye in a bizarre episode in 1958, representing one of the founders of the notorious promoter of the entertainment blacklist, Aware, Inc., in a complicated lawsuit against Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters. This brought him into contact with the young Robert F. Kennedy's Senate rackets investigation. Hoping that Kennedy might somehow straighten him out with the F.B.I., Crum began to leak information he'd been told privately by Teamsters lawyers; he finally agreed to testify publicly. In a Capitol Hill hearing room he even charged that Washington power broker Edward Bennett Williams, on the Hoffa team, offered to buy his silence. The charge was probably true, but Crum was so addled by drugs and alcohol that he got key facts wrong and was forced to retract his own statement. And there, essentially, Crum's life ends: Within a year he committed suicide after a dinner party. <br /> <br />The interesting thing about these two very different stories is that Crum brought to the inquisition so many seeming advantages over Rabinowitz: money, political connections, press contacts. Yet it was Crum who ended up shattered. It's easy enough to pin their different trajectories on character and temperament. But there's more to it than that. There were liberals with lives more orderly than Crum's who managed to be just as politically unsteady, including theera's A.C.L.U. director, Morris Ernst, who secretly passed information to Hoover. Maybe the difference is that a party attorney like Rabinowitz had little to lose, while a wealthy establishment lawyer could lose everything. Moreover, Crum and Ernst both believed their professional effectiveness depended on remaining respectable, on preserving access to the powerful--a thoroughly ineffectual self-deception and a lesson for today's access-preserving Washington liberals. (The self-deceptions were not all on one side. The standup silence of Rabinowitz and other party loyalists, while admirable in so many ways, was also part of a disastrous culture of secrecy that made anti-Communist attacks as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.) <br /> <br />Between them, these two biographies evoke the minute particulars of a defining moment in the history of U.S. civil liberties. It's easy to forget that most of the earliest important First Amendment precedents, in the shadow of World War 1, were more recent to McCarthy-era lawyers than the Hollywood Ten are to us today; the expansive First Amendment rulings of the Warren Court were still years away. And then there was the unprecedented challenge to lawyering itself. Going back to Samuel Adams and the Boston Massacre, the American legal system has generally maintained a clear distinction between advocate and client, but the loyalty cases punished lawyers and clients alike. While not every lawyer met the loyalty-case test with equal honor, virtually all did so at personal cost. <br /> <br />The loyalty cases, which once loomed large enough to make national political careers for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, now surface in the national consciousness only occasionally, like a bad dream fleetingly recollected over lunch. But theories of the First Amendment that today seem common sense were first articulated by loyalty-ease lawyers; for instance, Yale Law School Professor Thomas Emerson, who with I.F. Stone founded the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, conceived his magisterial The System of Freedom of Expression as an affirmative response to the witch hunts. If jurors today know enough about the First Amendment to acquit Oprah Winfrey of libeling the Texas beef industry, if opinion polls show a public suspicious of a messianic inquisitor like Kenneth Starr, it's largely because a contemporary language for free speech was created by the exhausted and embattled civil liberties bar of the fifties.	2005-09-17

Now, as President, he's betrayed them again, and in much the same way, standing in the ditch he calls high moral ground while Iraqi helicopter-gunships and troops butcher countless thousands of men, women and children. If this is \\"an Iraqi internal affair\\" in Washington's eyes, then so was the Nazi holocaust. With 200,000 or so troops still within Iraqi borders, Bush apparently sees nothing wrong with upholding Saddam's sovereign right to slaughter any religious or ethnic faction he feels inclined to. Why?  <br /> <br />Unholy Babylon provides answers to this and numerous other tricky questions, raising still trickier questions in the process. Darwish is one of the most respected and authoritative investigative reporters covering Middle East affairs. Egyptian by birth, he currently corresponds for The Independent, which consistently provided critical commentary of the war while most Western media waved the Stars and Stripes like hapless vassals. His co-author, \\"Gregory Alexander,\\" is regarded by those who are aware of his actual identity as one of the two or three supreme experts on international arms trading. He employs a pseudonym and lives in conditionsthat make Salman Rushdie's arrangements seem positively freewheeling. I'm betraying no confidence by saying he was once a British army officer serving in the Middle East, and then actually worked in the international arms industry for several years before conscience called. <br /> <br />Although people like Judith Miller (Saddam Hussein And The Crisis In The Gulf) and Samir al-Khalil (Republic Of Fear) have done yeoman's work covering similar territory, Darwish and Alexander, besides having access to stratospherically high-level source material, manage a level of concision and readability that makes coherent sense of close to a century's worth of history, much of it deliberately obfuscated, partially erased, or hopelessly tangled to protect the guilty. Who the guilty actually are is Unholy Babylon's main theme. <br /> <br />The book confirms that Iraq's plot to annex Kuwait was made known to most Arab leaders by February, 1990. Both the CIA and the Egyptian intelligence service warned their respective governments repeatedly, stating unequivocally by late September that Saddam's troops would definitely be moving across the border within days. Presidents Bush and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak chose to ignore these warnings. Why? <br /> <br />Reading this chilling and repulsive tale of big politics and even bigger business, you find yourself yodelling why? every 10 minutes. Why, for example, didn't we see much evidence of the $ 50 billion or so in high-tech arms sold by the U.S. to Saudi Arabia over the last few years? Why was America aligning itself with countries that had human rights records at least as bad as those of Saddam's Ba'athist regime they were conscripted to topple? And why did Bush encourage Iraqi Kurds and Shiites to embark on a civil war if he had no intention of supporting them - particularly since he'd stopped Stormin' Norman from trashing Saddam's war machine when the opportunity was available, and thus knew full well the rebels did not stand a chance against the kind of punch Baghdad could still deploy against them? <br /> <br />The truth is - as Unholy Babylon makes abundantly clear - that Washington prefers Saddam, the monster it made, and a Ba'athist reign of terror in Iraq to the prospect of a Kurdistan which could end up controlling the world's second largest oilfields, and a Shiite state in southern Iraq that would inevitably find itself a satellite of fundamentalist Iran. America's fear of Iran, the authors reveal, is indeed so great it must be considered the major factor in the decade-long cultivation of Saddam Hussein's regime - a cultivation that paralleled the lavish U.S. cossetting of the Shah's Iran, entailing techno-military assistance of the first order, including hands-on involvement by numerous American allies in the construction of weapons facilities more advanced than any outside North America or NATO. They became Desert Storm's first targets. <br /> <br />Besides naked greed and the mega-politics of oil, the only thing approaching reasons and answers this book offers is the suggestion that U.S. foreign policy has more to do with chaos and instability than it does with putting order in the \\"new world order.\\" As long as the U.S. is creating the chaos, it can operate within it quite happily and much more easily than it could within, say, a truly democratic Middle East. <br /> <br />Darwish and Alexander make no comment on the diabolical facts they began assembling even before August 2, 1990 but I'd like to meet the reader who does not finish Unholy Babylon with a sizzling sense of rage, despair and abject frustration aimed at those we have allowed to govern the allegedly-free world and who have abused that privilege by licensing a wrecking-crew to exploit and enslave the wretched of the Earth. <br /> <br />--- <br />Toronto Star Newspapers <br />July 6, 1991 Saturday <br /> <br />Authors examine the effects of international greed <br /> <br />Unholy Babylon presents a detailed account of the world'sfinancing of Iraq's military machine and the history of events that led to the invasion of Kuwait and the diplomatic posturing prior to the Persian Gulf War. <br /> <br />Authors Adel Darwish and Gregory Alexander display a sophisticated knowledge of Arab politics and history and the ruthless practices of the international arms trade. They combine extensive research with broad contacts and experience, giving Unholy Babylon an authority and depth that is both fascinating and chilling. <br /> <br />Darwish and Alexander contend that world leaders ignored warning signals, bungled messages and recklessly pursued their own short-sighted goals in the years and months that led up to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Again and again, they missed opportunities to curb Saddam Hussein's belligerence, even as Iraqi tanks rolled south towards Kuwait. <br /> <br />Furthermore, leaders of the East and West share the blame for helping create Saddam Hussein's mighty war machine. <br /> <br />Generous loans and financing from foreign governments and banks allowed Iraq to spend between $80 and $105 billion on armaments from 1980-90. During the mid 1980s, Iraq became the world's leading importer of arms. Even after the end of its war with Iran, Iraq continued to pump billions of dollars a year into weapons of mass destruction. <br /> <br />A few diplomats and intelligence officials raised murmurs of alarm, but these invariably were side-stepped by businesses and ministries of trade and commerce who were anxious to sell military wares to virtually any nation willing to buy. Effective embargoes were few. <br /> <br />The effects of international greed were compounded by anxious government and military leaders who were willing to do almost anything to stop the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. Better Saddam Hussein than the Ayatollah Khomeini, they reasoned. Saddam was pleased to take all the armaments they could offer. <br /> <br />Unholy Babylon makes clear that despite official government policy, most nations are prepared to turn a blind eye when arms sales boost local employment and stimulate the GNP. <br /> <br />As U.S. President George Bush trumpets a new policy of international arms control without controlling arms, the world seems to have learned little. Saddam Hussein is bloodied but unbowed. Billions of dollars worth of armaments continue to flow to the Middle East. <br />-- <br />Hamilton Spectator (Ontario, Canada) <br /> <br />December 4, 1991 Wednesday <br /> <br />...Readers bemused by the peaceniks' vitriolic attacks upon the Americans for the victory over Iraq will find Unholy Babylon most enlightening. <br /> <br />Written by two respected experts on the Middle East, Adel Darwish and Gregory Alexander, the book is sub-titled 'The Secret History of Saddam's War' and reveals much background material not generally known in North America, including Western bungling which allowed Saddam to invade Kuwait with impunity. <br /> <br />Meaty and detailed, yet readily understandable, the book will repay study by anyone wanting more than he finds in the media to understand the Gulf War. <br /> <br />-- <br /> <br />The Nation <br />March 29, 2004 <br /> <br />... Adel Darwish and Gregory Alexander in their 1991 book, Unholy Babylon,  [reported] that Washington was extremely alarmed by Qassim and the Communists, and therefore wooed the Baath Party as an alternative. When the Baath briefly came to power in 1963, the CIA passed to Saddam Hussein, probably an agency asset, a list of hundreds of Iraqi Communists, whom the new regime liquidated. The Baath was in the wilderness when the coup collapsed, but came back to stay in 1968. Again, Darwish and Alexander report assertions of US backing for the 1968 coup, confirmed to me by other journalists who have talked to retired CIA and State Department officials.	2005-08-14

Under the Geneva Convention, it was forbidden for prisoners of war to do any work of use to the enemy. Building the bridge might be construed as collaboration but there was no alternative. Toosey, from the outset, understood that the only real issue was to ensure that as many of his men as possible should survive. Under the circumstances, he achieved this to a remarkable degree. In the hellish conditions of the camp, he worked courageously to ensure that as many of his men as possible would survive. He endured regular beatings when he complained of ill-treatment of prisoners, but as a skilled negotiator he was able to win many concessions from the Japanese by convincing them that this would speed the completion of the work. Behind their backs, however, he did everything possible to delay and sabotage the construction without endangering his men, and also helped organize a daring escape, at considerable cost to himself. For his conduct in the camp, he won the undying respect of his men. <br /> <br />One of a number of Allied POW's, Toosey was in charge of his men from late 1942 through May 1943 when they were ordered to build two Kwai River bridges in Burma (one of steel, one of wood), to help move Japanese supplies and troops from Bangkok to Rangoon. In reality, the actual bridge took 8 months to build (rather than two months), and they were actually used for two years, and were only destroyed two years after their construction - in late June 1945. The memoirs of the 'real' Colonel Nicholson were compiled into a 1991 book by Peter Davies entitled \\"The Man Behind the Bridge.\\" <br />-- <br /> After the war, he showed great generosity of spirit by saving the life of Colonel Saito, second in command at the camp and a relatively decent officer, when he spoke up for him at the war crimes tribunal. He worked for the veterans all his life, and became President of the National Federation of Far Eastern Prisoners of War. <br /> <br />Toosey returned to Liverpool and resumed his career in banking. <br /> <br />He refused repeated requests by the veterans to speak out against the film, being much too modest to seek any glory or recognition for himself. However you will find his achievements documented in a book by Professor Peter Davies entitled \\"The Man Behind the Bridge\\". <br />--- <br />Extensive photos: <br /> <br />[...] <br />--- <br />Other books on the building: <br /> <br />[...] <br />---- <br />Extensive 27 page PDF file on the building of the bridge: <br />[...] <br /> <br />--- <br />13,000 prisoners of war died while building the Burma-Thailand Railway for the Japanese.	2005-07-12

Their country is occupied either by a foreign colonial power or by local landlords, generals, or self-serving politicians. As they see it, the issue is liberation. The goal is a radical redistribution of political and economic power to overcome centuries of political oppression and crushing poverty. The means is seizure of political power. <br />... the revolutionary idea-that radical change is necessary, that it is inevitable, and that it can come only by seizing the machinery of the state-has steadily grown. <br />p7 <br />Revolutionary movements grow in the soil of exploitation and injustice. <br />p8 <br />The historic aim of revolution, as Hannah Arendt has pointed out, is freedom, the opportunity to participate in the political process. <br /> <br />p8 <br />The United States government has seized upon the moral ambiguity of revolution to justify a global campaign to contain it, to channel it into acceptable paths, or to crush it. In 1938, President Roosevelt had to summon all his political powers to block the Ludlow Resolution for a constitutional amendment forbidding the President to send troops overseas without a national referendum. Less than ten years after its narrow defeat, his successor secured broad congressional support for use of American military power to put down violent revolution abroad. \\"We cannot allow changes in the status quo,\\" the President declared, \\"by such methods as coercion, or by such subterfuges as political infiltration,\\" making clear that it didn't matter whether revolutionaries were natives of the country they wished to change or not. Since violence is the engine of political change over most of the globe, President Truman committed the United States to a prodigious task. <br /> <br />The context of the Truman Doctrine made it perfectly clear that its target was not all \\"violence\\" or all \\"coercion\\" or all \\"changes in the status quo,\\" but only those having something to do with \\"communism.\\" The justification for treating communist revolutions as a unique political phenomenon rested partly on the premise that they were manipulated by the Soviet Union and partly on the dogma that the coming of communism to a society meant the end of its political evolution. It was assumed that once the \\"iron curtain'' descended upon a country, history stopped. It was lost forever, trapped in an ideological straitjacket. In the twenty years since the war, we have seen the fallacy of this latter assumption. Romania Hungary, and the Soviet Union itself have undergone profound political and social change. They are still communist regimes, but their character has evolved in many important ways, far more radically, certainly, than many right-wing dictatorships that have come to power by military coup but are exempt from the Truman Doctrine. <br /> <br />The word \\"communist\\" has been applied so liberally and so loosely to revolutionary or radical regimes that any government risks being so characterized if it adopts one or more of the following policies which the State Department finds distasteful: nationalization of private industry, particularly foreign-owned corporations, radical land reform, autarchic trade policies, acceptance of Soviet or Chinese aid, insistence upon following an anti-American or nonaligned foreign policy, among others. Thus, the American ambassador to Cuba at the time of the brief Grau San Martin government in 1933 found it to be \\"communistic.\\" In 1937 Cordell Hull privately spoke of the Mexican government, which was nationalizing U.S.-owned oil properties, as \\"these communists down there,\\" but made no public charge. Since the Second World War, however, the term \\"communist\\" has been used to justify U.S. intervention against a variety of regimes with widely differing ideologies and relationships with the Soviet Union, including Arevalo's Guatemala, Mossadeq's Iran Goulart's Brazil, Sukarno's Indonesia, Caamano's Dominican revolutionary junta, as well as insurgent movements in Latin America Africa, and Southeast Asia. <br />Indeed, from the Truman Doctrine on, the suppression of insurgent movements has remained a principal goal of U.S. foreign policy. It has been the prime target of the U.S. foreign-assistance program, most of the funds for which have gone for civic-action teams, pacification programs, support for local police, and, above all, military aid to the local army. Such expenditures are designed to strengthen the hand of the recognized government to put down the challenge of revolution. Economic aid is extended to Third World countries not only to buy their support on foreign-policy issues but also to lubricate the process of \\"gradualism\\" and strengthen the forces of \\"stability.\\". In other words, U.S. policy is to support governments that promise to revolutionize their societies from above, although, as the continued support of military dictators and reactionary regimes demonstrates, this is scarcely a requirement. ...	2005-06-20

The CIA's main contract at the firm was the late J.

The air is filled with flames and fumes. The shapes of men, seen through the smoke, become distorted and unreal. Promethean supermen, they seem, giants in sin or virtue, Satans or saviours. But, in truth, behind the screen of smoke and flame they are like other men: no larger and no smaller, no better and no worse: all creatures of the same incessant passions, hungers, vanities and fears. <br /> <br />So it is in Russia. And in this book I have tried to show the leaders of the revolution as they really are, as I know them in their homes, where the red glare does not penetrate and they live as other men. <br /> <br />Great events make great men. For to be strong enough even to maintain one's self amid great events is to be great. Without the event the strength is nothing. Had the revolt of 1917 failed, like the revolt of 1905, Lenin would have worked his life out in an attic in Geneva, Trotsky would have lived and died in a New York garret, Kalinin would have remained a disappointed, debt-burdened peasant, Tchicherin a futile ex-diplomatist in exile. The world would not have known their names: just as the world would not have known Napoleon or Danton or Marat or Robespierre had Louis XVI been a trifle less desperately dull. But the revolt of 1917 became a revolution and its colossal drive and heave flung up the exiles to greatness. As men it did not change them. <br /> <br />They differ from the political leaders one meets in Washington, London and Paris, largely because they are able to be franker and more themselves. Public opinion, which is the boon of politicians and the bane of statesmen, does not drive them to drab conformity or high-sounding platitude. The public they have to satisfy is small and sophisticated - the trade unions of the larger cities. And these workingmen demand, above all else, frankness and the unpowdered truth. An address by Lenin is, therefore, as direct, unsentimental and full of facts as a statement to a board of directors by an executive of an American corporation. The slow, strong wants of the peasants have to be heeded, too; but they are simple wants, land and free trade, and do not yet touch intricate things, remote from the daily life of the farm, like foreign affairs and higher economics. In the end the peasants will rule Russia, but today public opinion is the opinion of the class-conscious workingmen of the cities. Therefore, the leaders of Russia can afford to be frank. <br /> <br />In the western democracies, politics is the art of seeming frank while not being so. Only three types of politicians ever emerge in the highest places. First, the statesman of brilliant intellectual understanding, like Lloyd George, who always knows what he ought to do, and never does it - until the public also comes to understand, usually some months, or years, later. Second, the sentimentalist, who is always able to muddle an inconvenient understanding of facts and muffle his conscience with high-sounding principles that endear him to the public heart. Third, the kindly blockhead, who discovers what ought to be done just a little later than the public. These types do not exist in Russia. The trade unions compel the Russian politician to be a stark realist, talking frankly, acting on the best information he can obtain and giving that information fully to his public. The leaders pictured in this book will seem, therefore, franker and more direct than the leaders of the western world. <br /> <br />They will also seem more desperate; not because it is their natural character to be desperate but because they face as desperate a problem as ever strained the human brain. They have been caught, from the first, on the horns of the revolutionary dilemma. The same intolerable breakdown of economic life, which alone makes revolution possible, also predestines revolution to almost certain failure. That dull beast, the public, will move to revolution only when life has become unbearable, only when the established order has broken down so completely that ruins alone remain. Revolution does not come before ruin. And to build on ruins a new and fairer life is a task almost beyond the powers of men. So much of the exhausted energy of the nation must be consumed in re-establishing the mere fundamentals of life - food, shelter, clothing and security from fear - that little remains to attack the task of remoulding life in a shape that is closer to the heart's desire. But to this task the leaders of Russia have dedicated their lives. And if they succeed or if they fail, they will be remembered always for their courage in following an ideal through destruction, famine, death and the hatred of the world. <br /> <br />Here, then, they are: the Russians of today: <br /> <br />Close to the Tartar and the Cossack of the plain, children of serfs and Norsemen and Mongols - close to the earth and striving for the stars. <br /> <br />LOUISE BRYANT.  <br /> <br />From: [...]	2005-05-07

The National City Bank had investments in Haiti, but American policy according to the Hans Schmidt, was more the result of fears that European countries, specifically France and Germany, had their eyes on the Caribbean.  This is a good history of a sordid intervention that submitted a people to autocratic military rule and did little for economic development.

It tells the story of the various forces sent to Russia in 1918-19 by the Allies for what seemed at the time good reasons. Each was a separate expedition within the vast geographical range of Russia's western frontier. <br /> <br />Eventually all of them ended in humiliating failure, and their presence was used by the Bolsheviks (or Bolos as they were often called at the time) as patriotic propaganda in their struggle to win their own power. <br /> <br />The British were of course not alone in this venture (except in the Baltic sector). The nationalities of the forces engaged were: <br /> <br />55,000 Czechs  <br />12,000 Poles  <br />4,000 Serbs  <br />4,000 Romanians  <br />2,000 Italians  <br />1,600 British  <br />760 French  <br />28,000 Japanese (later increased to 70,000)  <br />7,500 Americans  <br />4,000 Canadians  <br /> <br />Hudson's researches cover a wide range of British sources, especially in the Imperial War Museum and in regimental archives. He has also had access to some personal reminiscences including those of his own father who had a very gallant record in the first world war. The general picture that emerges is decidedly confused, though there were creditable episodes, some of them involving men of outstanding ability such as General Ironside and General Alexander. Hudson has an eye for picturesque or amusing detail and he tells a number of extraordinary tales of adventure, some of which could probably be matched by the archives of other nationalities. However, the want of a consistent policy agreed among the participants is all too clear and it is hardly surprising that it all ended in tears. <br /> <br />In his concluding chapter,Hudson reverts to his main theme. He condemns the Allied intervention as having been embarked on without adequate care or sound information about the true situation in Russia and without any attempt to reach even the minimum agreement among the participants about the objectives of such a policy. Nor does it seem to have been realised that the state of morale of many of the armed forces of the Allies was dangerously low after the appalling losses in France. The upshot of the intervention was failure in every sector, even though the course of events included some skilful and courageous actions. <br /> <br />I found this a most enjoyable book, written in a lucid and straightforward style. It is well produced and illustrated with good maps and photographs. <br /> <br />Also see the book:   <br />Russian Sideshow: America's Undeclared War, 1918-1920	2005-04-20
US	38193789	R5E1FJOTECWE3	189887641X	968695053	Shaking The World: John Reed's Revolutionary Journalism	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Review from international socialism journal	INTERNATIONAL SOCIALISM JOURNAL Winter 1998  <br /> <br />by Judy Cox <br /> <br />At its best, journalism can help to undermine the ideology of the ruling class, revealing the connections between different aspects of the system, the role played by apparently neutral institutions of the state and the potential of workers' struggles to achieve change. John Reed, a US journalist born in 1887, was perhaps one of the greatest exponents of such journalism. His account of the Russian Revolution, Ten Days that Shook the World, is one the best descriptions of that revolution ever written, and Lenin himself recommended it unreservedly. However, John Reed recorded and participated in great struggles beyond Russia, across the American coalfields and the haciendas of Mexico. His writings are, therefore, a testimony to the power of committed journalism as well as to the struggles which he witnessed. <br /> <br />John Reed was born into a well to do family but the years in which he grew up, the first decades of the 20th century, were years of growing criticism of, and resistance to, the development of US capitalism. The 'robber barons' were forging business empires at home and the US state was forging its empire abroad in wars against Spain, Cuba and the Philippines. The growing revulsion at this increasingly naked and brutal drive for profits found popular expression in literature, for example in the novels of Upton Sinclair and Jack London which sold millions of copies. Even the acclaimed novelist Henry James wrote that the US was 'rank with each variety of the poison-plant of the money passion'.1 Alongside the politically committed novelists were a new breed of journalists--the muckrakers--who contributed to the atmosphere of protest. The year John Reed graduated from Harvard, 1910, was also a year in which the US stood on the brink of a period of tempestuous class struggle. In this infectious political atmosphere it was not surprising that a well educated young man from a comfortable background should start working for a radical magazine, The Masses. <br /> <br />It was as a reporter for The Masses that John Reed first encountered the class struggle in the flesh when he was sent to cover a strike by silk weavers in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1913. The forces involved in the strike were typical of many strikes in the US during this decade. On one side were the employers, backed up by the violence of the police, the courts and private 'detectives'. On the other were a desperate group of workers, many of them immigrants, whose only support was the Industrial Workers of the World. The IWW was a revolutionary syndicalist organisation which helped the Paterson strikers build rank and file solidarity so successfully that by March 1913 some 25,000 workers were striking. John Reed arrived in April and was almost immediately arrested, eventually finding himself in prison with the IWW leader, Big Bill Haywood. Reed described with great power and passion the treatment that the striking men, women and children received, how they were beaten off the pickets lines, arrested in their thousands and imprisoned in inhuman conditions. The scale of the arrests in Paterson was one of the highest in US labour history. In one trial a women in the audience was sentenced to 60 days in prison for smiling, and another for 30 days for gasping at this sentence! By the end of the strike five strikers had also been murdered. Reed's articles proved to be so popular that one Paterson policeman later complained that 'jailing one lousy poet' gave the IWW more publicity than jailing hundreds of strikers. <br /> <br />The weavers were eventually beaten back to work but the Paterson strike turned out to be a mere preliminary to the struggles which then erupted. In September 1913 the United Mine Workers of America took on J D Rockefeller's Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. The conditions in the mines were appalling, union members were summarily sacked and union organisers were regularly assassinated. The miners were fighting for an eight hour day, a 10 percent pay increase, union recognition, the limitation of company fraud and the enforcement of Colorado's mining laws! Despite a blizzard, all strikers and their families were immediately evicted from their company owned homes. The union established tent colonies to house 11,000 workers but these were frequently fired on by company guards. The strike reached a crisis point in April 1914 when National Guardsmen attacked the Ludlow colony with machine guns. Women and children hid in cellars dug under the tents and, when the guards set fire to their tents, some were burnt alive. At least two women and 11 children were killed. A union organiser, Louis Tikas, was captured and shot out of hand. <br /> <br />Reed arrived in Colorado shortly after the massacre. He described the tragic scene at the camp where baby carriages and children's toys lay riddled with bullets. Reed also wrote about how the miners responded--by launching a virtual insurrection in the coalfields. The miners' union openly armed the strikers and in a series of ferocious attacks scabs and guards were killed and mines dynamited. Reed described how news of the massacre spread like wildfire: <br /> <br />      In three hours every striker for 50 miles in either direction knows that the militia and mine guards had burned women and children to death. Monday night they started, with all the guns they could lay their hands on, for the scene of the action at Ludlow. All night long the roads were filled with ragged mobs of armed men pouring towards the Black Hills. And not only strikers went. In Aguilar, Walsenburg and Trinidad, clerks, cab drivers, chauffeurs, school teachers, and even bankers seized their guns and started for the front. It was as if the fire started at Ludlow had set the whole country aflame.2 <br /> <br />At this point the federal government intervened, not to protect the strikers but to protect the mine owners from them. Despite widespread outrage at the massacre and big demonstrations in solidarity with the strikers, the strike was defeated. For Reed, it was a 'transforming experience', similar to that which George Orwell underwent in Barcelona in 1937.3 When Reed reported from the strike, he called his article The Colorado War to drive home to his audience the violence that was being mobilised against the strikers. The article caused such outrage among those who supported the mine owners that some bookstores refused to sell the magazine which carried it. In the article, Reed explained the appalling provocation which drove ordinary workers to take up arms. He pointed out that the workers were not revolutionaries, but were simply fighting for a living wage and safety at work and for the implementation of the law. Reed explained how at every turn the workers were pushed towards militancy by the intransigence of the mine owners and the brutality of the tactics they used. <br /> <br />Reed also described how for generations miners fought back and were defeated, each defeat leading to their replacement with more recent immigrant workers. He gave a brilliant sense of how those divisions were eroded by the experience of living in the Ludlow camp: 'There were more than 1,200 people there, divided in 21 nationalities, undergoing the marvellous experience of learning that all men are alike. When they had been living together for two weeks, the petty race prejudices and misunderstandings that had been fostered between them by the coal companies for so many years began to break down'.4 The Colorado War exposes the reality behind the American dream--a reality of savage repression by the ruling class and working class unity forged in the heat of the struggle. It conveys an unforgettable sense of how militant the US working class tradition really is. <br /> <br />Before his trip to Colorado, Reed reported from Mexico which was in the turmoil of a revolution which, as John Newsinger points outin his introduction, was 'one of the great social revolutions of the 20th century'. When Reed arrived there in December 1913, General Huerta, who was installed by a military coup, was facing a rebellion by the Constitutionalists, an uneasy alliance between middle class liberals and the working class and peasant armies led by Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Reed was unequivocally on the side of the Villistas and Zapatistas, to the point of having to run for his life during a battle at La Cadena. Reed's articles from Mexico revealed the real roots of the revolution in the poverty of the land starved peons, who worked like draft horses on the big haciendas, and their growing desire for a representative government. He also launched a powerful polemic against the growing movement for US intervention in Mexico. He argued fiercely against the idea that the Mexican Revolution was merely a 'comic opera', asserting instead that it was the slowly accumulated grievances of the peons that had burst into life and that US intervention would inevitably mean crushing the newly awakened democratic aspirations of the Mexican people. <br /> <br />In September 1914 Reed wrote an article on the outbreak of the First World War, which he called The Traders' War. His article was a resounding condemnation of that war: <br /> <br />      We who are socialists, must hope--we may even expect--that out of this horror of bloodshed and dire destruction will come far reaching social changes--and a long step forward towards our goal of peace among men. <br />      But we must not be duped by this editorial buncombe about liberalism going forth to holy war against tyranny. <br />      This is not our war.5 <br /> <br />'This is not our war'--this was the theme he returned to again and again. He described how right across Europe young men were intimidated, bullied and shamed into 'volunteering' to fight, how Harrods department store loaded a truck with young clerks and sent them to the recruiting office with a big sign on the side: 'Harrods' Gift to the Empire'.6 In other articles Reed attacked the war fever growing in the US: 'I know what war means. I have been with the armies of all the belligerents except one, and I have seen men die, and go mad, and lie in hospitals suffering hell; but there is a worse thing than that. War means an ugly mob madness, crucifying the truth tellers, choking the artists, sidetracking reforms, revolutions and the working of social forces'.7 <br /> <br />The highlights of this collection of essays are, perhaps inevitably, Reed's reports from the Russian Revolution. His writings on Russia in this volume are not merely exciting accounts of the greatest revolution in world history, although that alone would be well worth reading. Reed combined his narrative accounts with insights which can help us refute some of the key criticisms levelled at the revolution. For example, Reed wrote that it was fashionable to consider the revolution as a mere adventure. He replied, 'Adventure it is, and one of the most splendid mankind ever embarked on, sweeping into history at the head of the toiling masses and staking everything on their vast and simple ideas'.8 Reed explained how the success of the revolution lay in the fact 'that the Kerensky government absolutely ignored the desires of the masses as expressed in the Bolshevik programme of peace, land and workers' control of industry', rather than in any skilful scheming by the Bolsheviks. He explained how disgust with the impotence of Kerensky's Provisional Government led to the 'astounding growth of the Bolsheviki' and how the Bolshevik Party was the 'ultimate political expression of the popular will'. In addition Reed emphasised the involvement of the masses in the revolutionary process: 'The entire insurrection is a stirring spectacle of proletarian mass organisation, action, bravery and generosity.' The revolution which Reed witnessed aroused the enthusiasm and participation of the masses and was not a coup undertaken by a small group of fanatics behind the backs of the working classes. Reed pointed out that, contrary to the image created in the bourgeois press, the Bolsheviks were reluctant to use violence against their opponents, how many of the reactionary Junkers were captured and released on their word of honour only to take up arms again, and how papers opposed to the Bolsheviks were allowed to publish. In addition, Reed was very clear that, 'if the Bolsheviki do not rise, the propertied class will make a coup d'tat a the Constituent Assembly!'9 In other words, the choice facing Russia in 1917 was not that between violent revolution and peaceful parliamentarianism, but that between the Bolsheviks or the White armies, socialism or barbarism. <br /> <br />Reed described momentous events: the opening of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, the storming of the Winter Palace and the frontline fighting between the Red Guard and the White armies. Any socialist reading these articles will experience a thrill when reading these lines, written for The Liberator in November 1918: <br /> <br />      The masses are in power... And on the morning of 13 November, after the defeat of Kerensky's Cossack army, Lenin and Trotsky sent through me to the revolutionary proletariat of the world this message: <br />      Comrades! Greetings from the first proletariat republic of the world. We call you to arms for the international social revolution.10 <br /> <br />Reed's 'A Picture of Petrograd' is a brilliant vision of a great city in the throes of social revolution. In another article championing the cause of the revolution printed in The Liberator during the German Revolution in 1918-1919, Reed points out that, while the Allies' military power merely broke the German offensive in the west, Soviet Russia conquered Imperial Germany completely and so ended the war with the German Revolution, because the rising proletariat was so much more powerful an enemy than the greatest military machine. <br />According to one witness, Reed arrived in Petrograd a rebel and left a revolutionary. As a revolutionary Reed was convinced that it was his duty to take the fight home to US workers and campaign against foreign intervention in Russia. But back in the US Reed found himself in the middle of a witch hunt against socialists. This was the era of what Gabriel Kolko has called 'political capitalism',11 where the huge industrial empires increasingly mobilised the power of the state to stem revolt from below. Reed described with understandable outrage the suppression of the socialist press, the horrific race riots of 1919 and the wholesale deportations of striking workers, a process which culminated in the Palmer Raids of January 1919. Confronted by this onslaught Reed embarked on a series of articles, published in a revolutionary paper, the New York Communist, which exposed the reality of 'capitalist democracy in America'. In these articles Reed explained the Marxist analysis of the state and refuted the idea that the US state was different because of its constitutional guarantee of the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. He revealed how the concentration of wealth in the hands of the capitalists led to the development of 'dollar diplomacy' and the increasing power of big business over the institutions of the state. He described the socialist ideas which arrived with successive generations of immigrants and how they fell prey to reformism: 'Even after the capitalist class in America had learned that government is not carried on in legislatures, but in banks and chambers of commerce, the workers still believed that political democracy could salve the problems of the wage earners'.12 <br /> <br />Throughout his writings, Reed expressed his contempt for the American Federation of Labour and its exclusion of unskilled workers. But in an article he wrote for the Communist International he also pointed out the fatal flaw in the revolutionary syndicalism of the IWW. The IWW led inspiring struggles under its banner of 'One Big Union'. Wherever workers fought, the Wobblies (as IWW members were known) were there to support them, black and white, men and women. Yet for all its heroism, 'from all the assaults upon the factory industries, from all the great strikes in the East, there is barely a skeleton of organisation left to tell the tale'.13 He concluded that the IWW was a powerful propaganda centre, but not a force which could win over the majority of workers. He also revealed how the Wobblies' rejection of 'politics', their exclusive focus on industrial militancy, left them vulnerable when faced with the onslaught of the capitalist state. So, for example, 'on the charge of \\"obstructing the war\\", the IWW was decapitated'.14 <br /> <br />In the spring of 1919 Reed began editing the New York Communist and led one of the two rival US Communist Parties which were established that year. While the two parties squabbled about who were the real Bolsheviks, the AFL, in spite of its craftism, was leading mass struggles. At the height of the 1919 steel strike, for example, 365,000 workers were out, but the Communists failed to build any influence over the workers involved. State repression continued unabated--in one case three men convicted of distributing leaflets against intervention in Russia were sentenced to 20 years in prison--and it almost destroyed the Communist Parties. Reed himself escaped arrest only by returning to Russia, where he contracted typhus and, due to a lack of medicine, died on 17 October 1920, a victim of the Western blockade of revolutionary Russia. <br /> <br />As the articles in this volume demonstrate, Reed remained committed to the prospect of revolution to the end of his all too short life. This collection gives a flavour of the class struggle which followed the First World War in Russia, then capitalism's weakness link, and also in the US, then emerging as the greatest world power. John Reed also analysed the political issues which lay at the heart of the victory of that struggle in Russia and its bitter defeat in the US. His burning criticisms of US imperialism, his consistent condemnation of the terrible racism of US society and his faith in the power of working class struggle are threads which run unbroken through this volume of revolutionary journalism at its best.	2005-04-17

US	38193789	RTZ9687L2EPFF	087073105X	370531980	Republic or Empire: American Resistance to the Philippine War	Books	5	3	3	N	N	New York Times Book Review	New York, N.Y.: Jul 23, 1972. <br /> <br />Republic Or Empire; American Resistance to the Philippine War. By Daniel B. Schirmer. Preface by Howard Zinn. 298 pp <br /> <br />The anti-imperialists of 1898 to 1904, long ignored, have been honored as prophets within the past several years by protesters seeking withdrawal from Vietnam. The anti-imperialist's' protests against military coercion of far-off dark-skinned peoples and their warnings against the perils and iniquities of empire have acquired a new cogency. Schirmer's is one of several full scale studies to appear since Americans became involved in Vietnam-and, although his New Left interpretations (fro the most part) follow a familiar outline, his is one of the most thoughtful and interesting of the accounts.  The main thrust is an economic determinism that is by no means an innovation of the New Left, since it represents pretty much the ideology of the anti-imperialists themselves-and of American protestors against involvement in war an overseas interventions throughout the 1920's and 1930's. <br /> <br />Schirmer sees a line of aggressive development in American history that runs from the early settlers wrestling land from the Indians to the present venture in Southeast Asia, and a second line of opposition.  But he confines himself to events from the 1880's into the early 1900's, focusing on the Philippine insurrection.  In these events there are parallels to the Vietnam war and also striking differences; Schirmer's book should be read as a historical interpretation of the anti-imperialist movement, not as a parable of present-day troubles. <br /> <br />Yet the theme of Americans' revulsion to wars is as persistent as that of their involvement in them.  To this Schirmer adds the debatable postulate that involvement was primarily for economic gain.  Illustrative of his views and the contents of the book is a speech that Morfield Storey, who was to be the prime mover in the anti-imperialist movement, deliveredbefore the Massachusetts Reform Club on the ever of the Spanish-American War:  <br /> <br />\\"Some represented in high Federal office think that war will improve business and increase the gains of the rich. I can't refrain from quoting the reply which was made to one of these last week by a Middlesex Yankee of pure blood.  He was a manufacturer of woolen goods, and a dealer in wool said to him, `We want war. Just think of how it will raise the price of wool, and how it will sever to send your good up.' `Yes,'  was the answer, `but think how much more the dye stuff will cost.  I can't afford to dye my goods in American blood. It comes to high.'\\" <br /> <br />Storey warned that the war would be a turning point in American development-for, with victory, \\"we should be fairly launched upon a policy of military aggression, of territorial expansion, of standing armies and growing navies...inconsistent with the continuance of our institutions.\\"  When the war did turn into a quick rout of Spain and offer opportunities for the United States to acquire colonies, Storey and likeminded leaders organized the American Anti-Imperialist League.  First, it fought against the treaty of acquisition with Spain.  Then, in the election of 1900, it allied itself with William Jennings Bryan and workingmen to try and defeat the McKinley Administration.  Nut McKinley secured ratification of the treaty-and in 1900, with the slogan of the \\"full dinner pail\\" routed Bryan and the anti-imperialists.  <br /> <br />The final stand of the anti-imperialists was against the cruel subjugation of the insurgents and unfriendly villages during the drawn-out Philippine insurrection-a far bloodier and more costly struggle than the Spanish-American War.  In this instance their publicizing of atrocities did much to bring reform within the military establishment, but not the relinquishment, until a generation later, of the Philippines.  They also succeeded in turning American feelings against further territorialacquisitions. Secretary of State John Hay told a friend in the spring of 1900 that public opinion would not stand for annexation of territory in China.  Schirmer says the shift was only one \\"from outright colonialism to indirect forms of political domination, accompanied by economic penetration, and, on occasion, by military intervention.\\" <br /> <br />What distinguishes Schirmer's interpretation is the emphasis he places upon the role of racism in the imperialist thrust, and the interrelationship between the maintenance of white supremacy in the South and the domination of dark-skinned people in the Hawaiian Islands and the Philippines.  Anti-imperialists were striking at their racism as much as at military and economic exploitations.  He points out, as have others, that the anti-imperialist leaders-predominantly Bostonians-were elderly survivors of the abolitionist movement; Storey had been secretary to the abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner.  He might have added that after the waning of anti-imperialism, Storey helped mount the N.A.A.C.P. fight in the courts to win bit-by-bit equality under the law for black people. <br /> <br />The imperialist ventures coincided with a new wave of state legislation and mob action throughout the South to block Negroes from the polls. In the election of 1898, more than a score of North Carolina blacks were killed, and four more lynched. The ant-imperialists Boston Advertiser declared, \\"The white man's government of the North Carolina pattern is precisely the government which so-called expansionists hope to put in operation... in the Philippines.\\"  And the imperialist Memphis Commercial Appeal Agreed: \\"How are we going to govern the Philippines, Hawaii, and other new possessions? Peaceably if we can; or like the white men are doing in the Carolinas, if we must, but govern them we will.\\" <br /> <br />Negro leaders, protesting against both lynchings and imperialism charged that McKinley was seeking Southern support for his acquisitions by dropping the traditional Republican gestures toward Negro rights.  Archibald H. Grimke joined other prominent Boston lawyers in urging Negroes to vote against the party of Lincoln: \\"Scratch the skin of Republican leaders like Hanna, Lodge, Roosevelt and McKinley and you will find race prejudice underneath, and invincible belief on their part in the divine right to the Anglo-Saxon to govern the republic and subject darker races.\\"  Further, the plutocracy unless checked, \\"would ultimately convert the republic into an empire...into a government of by and for vast syndicates of wealth.\\" <br /> <br />Despite the rather simplistic overall interpretation resulting from Schirmer's preoccupation with economic  factors, this is an important book.  It would have been even better if he had broken out of the confining mold of New Left history and ranged more widely in his examination of motivations and actions-particularly of the imperialist and their large following.	2005-04-16

When did American soldiers conduct their first body count and pioneer the use of the \\"water cure\\" to persuade Asian guerrillas to betray their comrades? <br /> <br />After which battle did a young rifleman write home to the folks in Kingston, New York, \\"I am in my glory when I can sight my gun on some dark skin and pull the trigger\\"? <br /> <br />Modern as it all sounds, the answer is not Vietnam, or even Korea or World War II. The American conquest of the Philippines barely rates a mention in school history books, usually as a cryptic footnote to the short war which President William McKinley and publisher William Randolph Hearst waged on Spain in 1898 for the independence of Cuba and the circulation of Hearst's newspapers. Yet 126,458 Americans fought in the Philippines between 1898 and 1902, of whom 4,234 died, while 16,000 Filipinos died in battle and another 200,000 in \\"reconcentration camp.\\" There were in addition massacres of civilians in reprisal for guerrilla attacks and similar sideshows all too familiar in subsequent Asian wars. <br /> <br />The story of how, and why America liberated the Philippines from Spain and then took the islands back from their inhabitants two weeks later is a complicated one, already well told in one of the classics of American historiography, Leon Wolff's Little Brown Brother, published in 1960. But the writing of history is never finished, and David Haward Bain has managed another fine book on the subject, not disagreeing with Wolff's conclusions, but making them fresh and vivid for a generation which has seen yet another Asian war. <br /> <br />This is not, however, simply another tale of savagery in the rice paddies. Almost as if he could read tomorrow's newspapers, Bain has brought his account up to the minute, with perceptive entries, for instance, indexed under Aquino Benigno and Ver, General Fabian (the latter currently on trialfor complicity in the former's assassination). This energetic young historian has thus pulled off that rarest of publishing coups, a scholarly historical work of bang-on topicality. He has, what's more, found a most original way of bringing his story to life. <br /> <br />From this distance, and even at the time, the American conquest of the Philippines has always been difficult to fathom. But, then and now, two figures jump forth from a cast of thousands: Emilio Aguinaldo, not quite 30, brave and passionately patriotic, the president of the republic of the Philippines proclaimed as the beaten Spaniards departed (and the first republic in Asia) and Colonel Frederick Funston, six years older, who drove the last nail into the republic's coffin by capturing Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901, after a long and daring hunt through the jungles and mountains of northern Luzon. <br /> <br />Aguinaldo, who looked remarkably like his current successor, Ferdinand Marcos, survived his capture and lived a long life, long enough to welcome the arrival of the Japanese in 1942 (understandably, perhaps; the new invaders also promised liberation), to march in the Manila independence parade of 1946, carrying the flag he first raised against Spain in 1896, and to see a new American war just getting under way in Asia in 1964, the year of his death. A largely forgotten figure now, even in the Philippines, Aguinaldo emerges from Bain's book an authentic hero and his republic a tragically missed chance for the United States to have been the protector of Asia's first genuine democracy. <br /> <br />His captor, the adventurous son of a Kansas politician known as \\"Foghorn Funston, the farmers' friend\\" was plainly just as archetypal a figure. \\"I am afraid that some people at home will lie awake nights worrying about the ethics of this war, thinking that our enemy is fighting for the right of self-government\\" he told a New York Times correspondent. \\"The word independent, which these people roll overtheir tongues so glibly, is to them a word, and not much more . . . . they are, as a rule, an illiterate, semisavage people, who are waging war, not against tyranny, but against Anglo-Saxon order and decency.\\" Funston's feat, a mixture of reckless daring and ingenious double-cross, or what used to be known in Vietnam as a \\"John Wayne stunt,\\" was the stuff of movies, and would have made a splendid vehicle for James Cagney (Funston was 5 feet 4 inches tall and touchy about it) if Hollywood had blossomed before American imperialism went out of fashion. <br /> <br />BUT, LIKE MANY a veteran from the East, Funston could not settle down to life back home, took to the bottle and died at 51 in 1917, when he was being seriously considered for command of the American Expeditionary Force that went to France that year. But for his heart attack, in fact, we would very likely now be debating the merits of the Funston rocket instead of the one named for his deputy, General John Pershing, who got the job instead. <br /> <br />Here, unmistakably, we have the Green Beret, or cowboy turned romantic military stuntman. In fact, Funston's boss, General Arthur MacArthur, father of the even more famous Douglas, was an old Indian fighter, and so were many of his buddies in the 20th Kansas infantry he led to the Philippines. The fact that the Far East is West of the Wild West has profoundly shaped America's wars there, a point made in the insightful and absurd movie The Deer Hunter. <br /> <br />It is hard to quarrel with Bain's conclusion that the years of American rule did little or nothing to solve the basic political problem of the Philippines. After three centuries of Spanish colonial government, the islands had none of the institutions of self-rule and no experience of it. All the new rulers achieved was a superficial Americanization of the illustrades, the Hispanicized native upper class, leaving the masses in pious poverty and the way open for a native-born dictatorship to follow theauthoritarian rule of slippery Spaniards and decent Anglo-Saxons. People learn self-government by governing themselves and making their own mistakes, and America put off the Philippines' fateful day for 50 years, failing, in the end, even to supply the military protection that is the only justification for empire. <br /> <br />But Americans are still well thought of in the Philippines, as Bain and a group of friends, including his photographer-brother Christopher, discovered when they repeated Funston's epic trek through the Luzon jungle in 1982, talking to the same locals, fording the same streams, and being bitten by descendants of the same mosquitoes which bit the pint-sized adventurer and his party 80 years earlier. Melding past and present, and interweaving the historical background with present politics brings vividly home the long shadows still cast by America's first adventure in Asia. This is an important story, honestly researched and well told -- a second classic, in fact, on a fascinating subject.	2005-04-16

Oddly enough, even the Spanish-American War, which begot the conflict in the Philippines, is much better remembered, in spite of the fact that it involved fewer combatants, fewer casualties and considerably less time. No doubt this is because the Spanish-American War is widely thought to have heralded America's rise to world power, whereas, in the view of most historians, the Philippine War was a blind alley -- a short-lived U.S. foray into colonialism. <br /> <br />When the Philippine War is remembered, it is typically for the purpose of denouncing the United States as an imperialist power. Here, after all, was another U.S. war fought in the jungles of Asia that generated considerable opposition at home and charges of atrocities committed by U.S. troops. (By their own count, U.S. forces claimed to have killed 16,000 Filipinos in battle, four times the U.S. casualties.) New Left histories, such as Stuart Miller's Benevolent Assimilation and Leon Wolff's Little Brown Brother, depict the U.S. war effort in the Philippines in a distinctly grim light. In their telling, the war is reduced to a simple tale of racist U.S. soldiers torturing, killing and raping Filipinos. Such works aim to prove that My Lai was no aberration -- that this is how U.S. soldiers usually behave, or at least how they usually behave when fighting non-Westerners. <br /> <br />Brian McAllister Linn, a history professor at Texas A&M University who has been studying the Philippine War for two decades, offers a welcome alternative to this tendentious catalogue. Whereas the New Left writers focus almost exclusively on alleged U.S. atrocities and public opinion in America, Linn recounts what actually happened on the battlefield. What he reveals is one of the most successful counterinsurgency campaigns of modern times (rivaled among Western powers only by the British in post-World War II Malaya). <br /> <br />True, the U.S. victory can be credited in some measure to mistakes by the enemy. Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the Philippine Republic, was no Ho Chi Minh -- and Antonio Luna, his top general, was no Vo Nguyen Giap. Aguinaldo committed the fatal error of trying to engage the U.S. Army in a conventional war. His forces were mauled during a series of battles in 1899 that began just outside Manila in February and finished in northern Luzon ten months later. Thereafter, Aguinaldo resorted to guerrilla warfare, but his government, dominated as it was by ilustrados (wealthy landowners), never succeeded in rallying the Filipino people to its cause. <br /> <br />Still, the eventual U.S. triumph was hardly foreordained. There were never more than 70,000 U.S. troops in the islands, and an average of only 24,000 men in the field, facing at least 80,000 insurgents. (By way of comparison, in the first Chechen war of 1994-95, the Russians had a 3 to 1 manpower advantage and still managed to lose.) The American technological advantage was not great -- in the beginning of the war, most U.S. troops were armed with Civil War-vintage Springfield rifles that were inferior to the rebels' Mausers (eventually, all U.S. regiments received more modern Krag-Jorgenson rifles). The United States could bring to bear superior firepower from artillery and navy gunboats, but even in the war's early days these advantages were to some extent obviated by the difficult jungle and mountain terrain; later on, heavy weaponry proved almost entirely irrelevant to combating the elusive guerrillas. Moreover, while the insurrectos were acclimated to local conditions, foul weather and disease ravaged U.S. ranks. Finally, the rebels, with informers in everybarrio, possessed better intelligence about the U.S. Army than the army had about them. <br /> <br />Ultimately the army pacified the islands using a two-pronged approach -- what has been dubbed \\"attraction\\" and \\"chastisement.\\" The policy of attraction -- renamed \\"hearts and minds\\" in Vietnam -- has been slighted by New Left historians, but it contributed significantly to the U.S. victory. The army ran schools, hospitals, sanitation programs and other charitable works. The colonial administration also granted generous terms to rebels who surrendered, and held out the promise of eventual independence for the islands. Eventually, more and more Filipinos tired of the war and concluded that American rule was in fact preferable to the \\"dons\\" who had come before, and perhaps even to Aguinaldo's oligarchy. <br /> <br />It is the policy of chastisement that has drawn unwelcome attention to the U.S. war effort, both in the early 1900s and in the years since. The American press avidly reported tales -- some confirmed, some not -- of U.S. soldiers shooting prisoners, burning down towns, gathering up natives in \\"reconcentration\\" camps and administering the \\"water cure\\" (restraining a suspect and forcing water down his throat) to gain information. This led to Mark Twain's mordant suggestion (not mentioned by Linn) that Old Glory be redesigned, with \\"the white stripes painted black and the stars replaced by the skull and crossbones.\\" <br /> <br />Many of these abuses did occur, but Linn puts them into proper perspective. He notes that isolated garrisons in the boondocks (a Tagalog word) had to operate against an unseen enemy who would kill or mutilate their buddies one day and be smiling \\"amigos\\" the next. It is hardly surprising that in such trying circumstances soldiers did not always heed Marquess of Queensbury rules. Then, too, it is not entirely fair to judge the actions of turn-of-the-century soldiers through a lens of contemporary norms. This was a more brutal time, whenpolice departments in America routinely used the \\"third degree\\" to elicit confessions and U.S. soldiers themselves were subject to harsh hazing and physical punishment that would not be tolerated today. Indeed, by the standards of the day, the conduct of U.S. soldiers was probably better than average for colonial wars -- certainly nothing the Americans did rivaled the depredations of the Belgians in the Congo. What Linn does not point out, but could have, is that U.S. forces probably killed more civilians in one night of bombing Dresden than in all of the Philippine War. <br /> <br />This is easy to overlook because most histories of the war concentrate on only a few of its more brutal episodes; for instance, General J. Franklin Bell herding thousands of residents of Batangas province into \\"reconcentration\\" zones where many died of disease. Linn widens this focus to look at what was happening outside the main island of Luzon, the heartland of the Tagalogs and hence of resistance to the occupation. He notes that in half the archipelago's provinces there was no fighting at all. Many of the minority ethnic groups were resentful of Aguinaldo's Tagalog-dominated government and were more than ready to cooperate with the occupiers. Thousands of local men even signed up to fight alongside the Americans in battalions such as the Macabebe Scouts, a unit renowned for its courage and ferocity (and which is today denounced as collaborationist by patriotic Filipino historians). <br /> <br />In the end, the success of the U.S. counterinsurgency effort owed not to atrocities committed but to the attention paid to the rudiments of counterinsurgency strategy. Unlike in Vietnam, the army did not squander its resources on fruitless search and destroy missions; rather, it concentrated on cutting off the guerrillas from civilian assistance by garrisoning the countryside. Even more important, U.S. forces interdicted the guerrillas' lines of supply. Linn credits the navy with an often overlooked role in blockading the Philippines, which \\"not only prevented foreign arms shipments but also effectively ended inter-island trade\\", making it difficult for Aguinaldo to raise money and move reinforcements. Geography also played a key role: in the Philippine Islands, there were no sanctuaries and no Ho Chi Minh trails to keep the guerrillas in business. <br /> <br />Even with the insurrectos cut off from outside support, it nevertheless took a long time to bring the insurgency to an end. Optimistic estimates that the archipelago would be pacified in 1899 were not borne out; neither were similar predictions in 1900 and 1901. Just when the army thought it had the situation under control, some fresh setback would occur to remind Americans that victory was not around the corner -- the most notable disaster being the massacre of forty-six men from Company C, Ninth Infantry, at Balangiga on the island of Samar on September 28, 1901. Even after President Roosevelt declared the war over on July 4, 1902, resistance continued for years on outlying islands among the Muslim Moros. (In fact, Moro resistance to rule from Manila has never really ended; even today, Moros battle the Philippine Army.) <br /> <br />Presumably, if the War Department had been in the grip of the Weinberger/ Powell Doctrine in the early 1900s, it would have thrown up its hands in despair. But the generals of that day had a more realistic, or at any rate more resigned, attitude. They realized that only police work could ultimately produce lasting victory. That is true not only in the Philippines but in most wars. When American forces withdraw immediately after winning a battle, as they did in the Gulf War, very little is left decided. As Michael Howard has argued, only long-term occupation can transform battlefield victory into more than a temporary armistice. The U.S. Army applied this insight in the post-1865 South and post-1945 Germany and Japan, but seems loath to apply it today in places like Kosovo. To be sure, the stakes are considerably smaller there, but so is the U.S. commitment. <br /> <br />The Philippine experience is worth recalling because in the post-Cold War era the United States is once again undertaking imperial policing. It is doubtful that any conflict we fight will be as prolonged or bloody as the Philippine War, but the experience of 1899-1902 ought to teach us that guerrillas should not be feared unduly. They can be defeated by a regular army -- so long as it abjures a conventional military mindset. <br /> <br />Counterinsurgency requires a police department, not a war department, mentality. This in turn means demonstrating greater patience than is typical of our instant gratification culture. No one expects the New York Police Department to declare victory tomorrow in the war against crime and go home. Likewise, we should not expect that our mission in the Balkans will be completed anytime soon. In real life, few military commitments offer easy \\"exit strategies.\\" But that does not mean we will find ourselves trapped in a \\"quagmire\\" or headed for \\"another Vietnam.\\" It simply means that for military professionals there remains a hard, wearying, inglorious job ahead.	2005-04-16

Raskin <br />New York Times Book Review  <br />January 28, 1968  <br /> <br />The concern of this compelling book is with the march of the nation's industrial workers out of conditions as destructive of health and self-respect as any that had prevailed on Southern plantations under slavery. <br /> <br />It is a one-dimensional story of battle by an infant labor movement against the forces of corporate greed in a period when all the institutions of government and polite society were on the side of the employer.  The very fact that the book is episodic and often overdrawn adds to its usefulness in supplying a new generation of readers with some illumination things unions do now that they when large membership, huge treasuries and economic power sufficient to paralyze entire communities... <br /> <br />Mr. Meltzer's pages, prickly with eyewitness accounts of unionism's birth pains in the sweatshops, the factories, the railroads and the mines, are a goad to revitalized activity in defense of industrial democracy and higher economic standards for those who remain on the outskirts of American affluence.  <br /> <br />Listen to this 1880 report by a textile mill superintended on how his mill insured labor peace when new technology enabled it to switch fro a process known as mule spinning to an alternate technique called ring-spinning. <br /> <br />\\"The mule-spinners area tough crowd to deal with.  A few years ago they were giving trouble at this mill, so one Saturday afternoon, after they had gone home, we started right in and smashed up a roomful of mules with sledgehammers. When the men came back on Monday morning, they were astonished to find that there was no work for them.  That room is now full of ring framers run by girls.\\"  <br /> <br />Often it was not the machinery but the workers who were smashed.  Federal troops, the state militia, the police and hired thugs were at the call of the bosses when a strike got too big or too stubborn.  Mr. Meltzer includes generous excerpts from John Reed's classic description of the 1914 massacre of strikers and their wives and children at the Rockefeller-owned coal mines at Ludlow, Colorado.  No less heart-rending is Ray Stannard Baker's report on the great 1912 uprising of the textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, under the slogan that gave the book its title, \\"We want bread and roses too.\\" <br /> <br />All the bloody way stations on the road to labor's present strength are points of call for Mr. Meltzer. There are Homestead and Pullman and Haymarket Square, where a bomb explosion in 1886 killed seven Chicago policeman and labor's immediate hopes for an eight-hour day. Four anarchist leaders were hanged for the bombing, though there was no credible evidence of guilt. <br /> <br />Prophetically, one of the convicted men said on the scaffold after the hood had been fastened over his head: \\"There will come a time when out silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today.\\" And so it proved when the new Governor of Illinois, John Peter Altgeld, pardoned three others on their way to the gallows, insisting that they had been framed and that the real offenses against justice had been committed by the men of property and the enforcers of law and order. <br /> <br />Many will feel, with considerable validity, that Mr. Meltzer's book is oversimplified history-that none of the epic labor struggles he recounts could possibly have involved such a monopoly of guilt as emerges from page after page of worker's laments about the villainy of their employers.  Still others may argue that, in any event, such as unrelieved picture of industrial oppression has scant relevance to this day when labor is often the aggressor and shows autocratic unconcern about the hardship its abuses of power inflict on the public. <br /> <br />But those who put forth such demurrers will find it hard to explain why other pillars of the community, through all the period of which Mr. Meltzer writes, were invariably certain that labor was ruining the country by its arbitrariness and its contempt for lawful process.  N o present executive of a giant corporation looks back with pride on what happened at Homestead or Ludlow; the fashion now is shamefaced dismissal of such episodes as skeletons to be buried with the vanished \\"robber baron\\" phase of capitalist expansion. <br /> <br />Yet, while the battles were going most of the other civilized voices were almost as one in deploring the \\"anarchy\\" of the strikers and warning that no society could survive such lawlessness,  \\"The mob is a wild beast and needs to be shot down,\\" said The New York Herald of the vanquished railroad strikers in 1877.  And a similar expression of contemporary civic outrage attended almost every other contest in the Meltzer chronicle... <br /> <br />Mr. Meltzer's book will not tell young people all they need to know about labor.  But it will give them a better understanding of the reasons for labor's undiminished belief that its unity is its only dependable source of strength, the rock on which rests both its material success and its capacity for survival.	2005-04-16

Not surprisingly, as Goldstein points out, \\"[t]he head of the APL urged his chief lieutenants to obtain financial support from leading businessmen `who usually are the ones benefited in a property sense by the protection afforded by our organization.'\\"<br /><br />But the APL was just a warm-up for the Palmer raids--named after Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer--which, beginning in late 1919, led to the roundup of thousands of immigrants and the forced deportation of hundreds on the grounds that they were \\"communists.\\"<br /><br />Palmer laid the groundwork by stoking panic and racist fears of \\"alien filth.\\" Like U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft today, Palmer issued warnings of violent attacks against the government--which never materialized.<br /><br />The Palmer raids happened in the midst of massive strikes in the steel and coal industries and meant that thousands of strikers were arrested on minor charges, such as laughing at police. In the end, they targeted the remnants of the Industrial Workers of the World and the newly founded Communist Party (CP). In one day in 1920, 5,000 to 10,000 CP members were rounded up in 30 cities.<br /><br />Goldstein's book is an exhaustive accounting of the U.S. government's history of repression--from putting down the great laboruprisings of the 1870s to the FBI infiltration and decimation of Black revolutionary groups and peace organizations in the 1970s.<br /><br />It shows how politicians justify attacks on civil liberties by appealing to the \\"need for security,\\" but also how they use their expanded powers to go after anyone who dares to dissent.	2005-04-16

Sexton's compelling argument is that America's unique conservatism is less the result of the weaknesses of labor than of the \\"unique corporate power and wealth\\" in the country and the use of these resources to wage a \\"uniquely repressive war\\" on labor and left-of-center politics.<br /><br />The book contains five parts. In Part 1, Sexton discusses the limitations of other theories that attempt to explain America's conservatism. Part 2 treats the history of repression of labor unions; Part 3, the history of political repression from the Alien and Sedition Acts to McCarthyism, as well as the unique hardships that third parties face in the American political system; Part 4, the subtle mechanisms that have been used against labor from the early welfare capitalism of Rockefeller to the more recent effects of deindustrialization, corporate restructuring, anti-labor consultants, deregulation, privatization, and labor-management cooperation; and Part 5 contains Sexton's argument that the greater repressiveness of American capitalists derives from their exceptional wealth and power, including their domination of the mass media.<br /><br />The book is based largely on secondary sources, including studies of European, Canadian, and Australian labor. Sexton fortifies her argument at every point with telling comparisons to the histories of labor and capital in other capitalist countries.<br /><br />I have only one serious reservation about this valuable book. In failing to accord American Communists a legitimate and important place in the history of American labor, and in condemning only the \\"excesses\\" of McCarthyism rather than the whole thrust of postwar anti-Communism, the author is as much an example as a critic of America's unique conservatism.	2005-04-16

Goldman <br /> <br />The anarchist Alexander Berkman left his restaurant and his mistress, traveled down to Homestead, Pa., fired two shots point blank at the Carnegie steel manager, Henry Clay Frink. Pvt. William L Iams of the Pennsylvania National Guard heard the news, shouted \\"three cheers!\\" and was sentenced by his commanding officer to hand by his thumbs until he was unconscious.  Strike leaders were arrested for \\"treason,\\" a labor sympathizer hired a cook to put arsenic and croton oil in the food of scabs, and workers fought Pinkertons with rifles, cannons and dynamite.  <br /> <br />The homestead steel strike of 1892 was certainly one of the most savage labor battles in the history of the United States.  It reflected the deep cleavage that had developed in American life by 1890's and it affected all labor-management relations for decades to come.  The details from an engrossing story and Leon Wolff, author of the fine historical works, \\"In Flanders Field\\" and \\"Little Brown Brothers,\\" does it full justice in this imaginatively researched and vividly written volume. <br /> <br />The noisy issue in the strike was wages, but a more fundamental question was whether the Carnegie Steel Company was going to continue to deal with the union, the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers.  Still more basic was the issue that racked all aspects of American life in the 1890's: Was business to operate solely to make as much money as possible or did it bear some responsibility for helping to bring about a decent way of life for its employees? <br /> <br />Andrew Carnegie, the principal owner of the Homestead operation, had written quite specifically of his respect for unions and his general concern for labor.  But during the strike he kept right onvacationing in Scotland and did nothing to soften the policy of his company.  He left the direction of the firm's actions to Henry Clay Frick, a pale, humorless, harsh minded man)\\"In all the world he had not one friend,\\" M. Wolff writes.)  who early in life had dedicated himself to the relentless pursuit of profits.  The union leadership was quite capable of naivet.  The whole country was filled with a bedlam of movements of discontent.  The result were a brutal strike-one reflected in angry feelings across the nation.   <br /> <br />At first, the clash was technically a lockout.  When Frick tried to land about 300 Pinkertons men under cover of darkness on the Monongahela River side of the plant, the outraged workers opened fire with every weapon available.  This and ensuing event led to about 35 deaths-including at least two suicides-and wholesale destruction in the area.  When the lockout turned into a strike, Frick remained totally rigid and in time the striking workers drifted out of town or came to work like so many whipped animals.  The union was destroyed. Strike leaders were blacklisted in the whole industry.  At Homestead the 12-hour days, seven days per week, with a24 hours stretch period every second week, was restored for all classes of workers. <br /> <br />Mr. Wolff makes every effort to be fair.  (\\"Lockout\\" is one of the most impartial labor histories we have.) But objectivity required that he describe the pathetic condition of the workers, the iron policies of Frick and the soaring profits made by the company as a result of breaking the strike. It also required his description of the strange behavior of Carnegie.  Mr. Wolff comments: \\"The actions taken by the Carnegie company were in gross violation of the pro-labor principles he himself had stated for so many years.  He was-or appeared to be-the hypocrite supreme. <br /> <br />The reader shares fully the irony of Mr. Wolff's little story of the aged Carnegie, regal in his Fifth Avenue mansion, turning to a secretary and asking, \\"How much did you say I had given away, Poynton?\\" <br /> <br />\\"$324,657,399\\" <br /> <br />\\"Good Heaven! Where did I ever get all that money?\\" <br /> <br />Curiously enough, \\"Lockout\\" does not sufficiently emphasize an important aspect of the Homestead strike.  It was one of the major events of the 1890's which, because of their very bitterness, helped undo men of the Frick mentality.  It was an alarm bell not only to the humane but to the pragmatic.  Memories of the strike helped leaders like President Theodore Roosevelt make plain to the larger public that if some restraints were not put on the money-driving of the more ruthless, the whole American system of free economy might well give way to some variety of Socialism. <br /> <br />Whatever its minor flaws, \\"Lockout\\" is not only absorbing but highly encouraging reading.  In our own era, every other spring may bring troubles between labor and management in the steel industry but a repetition of the Homestead is inconceivable.  \\"Lockout\\" makes clear, as only rich history can, just how far toward sanity and decency we have traveled.	2005-04-16

It was, in the words of contemporary journalist John L. Spivak, \\"one of the most fantastic plots in American history.\\" <br /> <br />Spivak's assessment in his 1967, A Man in His Time:  <br /> <br />\\"What was behind the plot was shrouded in a silence which has not been broken to this day. Even a generation later, those who are still alive and know all the facts have kept their silence so well that the conspiracy is not even a footnote in American histories.\\" <br /> <br />Socioeconomic and Political Context of the Plot <br />(An excerpt from a chapter called \\"The Plot To Seize Washington,\\" in A Man in His Time, pp. 294-298.) <br /> <br />By John Spivak <br /> <br />When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was first sworn in as President, the country was teetering on the brink of economic chaos and in the grip of a fear that almost paralyzed it. The capitalist system had collapsed. Almost every bank in the country was closed, millions were jobless, citizens were being dispossessed from their homes and their farms and bankruptcies were reaching a torrential stage. There was no sign of relief. <br /> <br />In desperate efforts to get the economy moving again, the President asked for and received from the Congress more powers than any President had ever been given in peacetime. He surrounded himself with advisers ranging from liberal theoreticians to spokesmen for big business. The loose coalition which formed around him soon became known as the \\"Brain Trust.\\" The President assured the people that his administration would give them a new deal. Nazi agents who were busy trying to split Americans into snarling racial and religious groups promptly dubbed the New Deal a \\"Jew Deal,\\" because the Brain Trust was \\"packed with Jews and communists\\" out to destroy capitalism. <br /> <br />Roosevelt created Government work projects so that the unemployed would be paid wages, their new purchasing power would enable manufacturers to produce again and stores would once more see what customers looked like. But to the rich this program was betrayal by a Government which in the past had always protected them. It was interfering with the law of supply and demand; it was taxing the rich and using their money to wreck the going wage scale in a glutted labor market. A former high official of the du Pont Company wrote to John J. Raskob, former Chairman of the Democratic Party and then a high du Pont officer, a heart-wrenching complaint: <br /> <br />\\"Five Negroes on my place in South Carolina refused work this Spring ... saying they had easy jobs with the government.... A cook on my houseboat at Fort Myers quit because the government was paying him a dollar an hour as a painter.\\" <br /> <br />Raskob, who like other rich men was genuinely perturbed by what was being done to the way of life the rich had known, advised his correspondent to join with others in setting up an organization which would educate America \\"to the value of encouraging people to work; encouraging people to get rich.\\" The tragedy in this advice was that he and others like him did not recognize that the old homilies we had accepted and honored from schooldays on just did not stand up when Americans were being buffeted by the greatest economic storm that had ever swirled about them. He simply could not see that the people did not need encouragement to work. They were wearing out their shoes in search of work. To tell a man who cannot find a job to feed himself and his family that he should strive to become rich was tragic for the jobless and pathetic for the wealthy. Yet many rich men honestly believed that if only the people adopted this outlook the devastating national problem would be solved. <br /> <br />Urgency was in the air; something had to be done before it was too late; and the President accepted a Chamber of Commerce suggestion that a body be established to direct \\"cooperative action among trade groups.\\" The result was known as the National Recovery Administration. When business urged that the anti-trust laws be relaxed so it could function more freely, the President listened and was willing to try. The NRA practically turned the \\"fair competition codes\\" over to business. Price-fixing was encouraged. <br /> <br />The codes formulated by the NRA seemed to indicate a trend towards government control of organized labor, which was the fascist way of handling trade unions. Apprehension over this trend was not allayed when the NRA Advisory Board suggested that \\"to have peace and equity ... the strike and lockout should be absolutely eliminated.\\" The small-businessman found himself being pushed to the wall. The sum total of the measures adopted by Roosevelt seemed designed to strengthen monopoly capitalism. Frightened trade unionists, liberals, the middle class and small business all saw them as moves toward fascism, which was widely accepted as the ultimate response of a capitalist system fighting to survive. Where fascism had taken over, it was apparently achieving the objectives business and finance wanted. What with labor having little to say about wage scales, 1933 and 1934 were notable for interminable strikes. Unions wanted more money; they also wanted the right to bargain collectively which the NRA had promised them. At the head of the NRA was a crotchety, blustering don't-tell-me-what-to-do general named Hugh S. Johnson. To him, use of the strike when he disapproved of it was practically insubordination, and he threatened to outlaw the right to strike altogether. This convinced trade unionists that establishing the NRA was really a major maneuver towards fascism. One member of the National Recovery Review Board resigned in protest against the NRA because, \\"Its development day by day reveals more clearly a trend toward fascism in the United States.\\" When the President moved to give labor its promised collective bargaining right, major industries which had kept their plants non-union by employing armies of labor spies and strikebreakers were faced with law-supported intensive organizing drives. The spirit spread to the farming population. In areas where farm lands and buildings were being auctioned for non-payment of taxes or other debts, the men who fed America joined with their neighbors to resist. When a neighbor's place was to be auctioned publicly, they sometimes took guns in hand and set up roadblocks to keep outsiders from taking part in the public bidding; only those in open collusion with the farmer were permitted to bid, and the farmer got back his property for a nominal sum. <br /> <br />Such collusion among farmers, the organizing drives by trade unions and the use of tax money from the rich to pay many of the unemployed on makeshift Government work, frightened business and the banks. The President's acts alienated former supporters. John J. Raskob wrote to an acquaintance complaining of \\"the Democratic Party being headed by such 'radicals as Roosevelt, Huey Long, Hearst, McAdoo. . . .\\" Alfred E. Smith, a man of the people who had been an excellent Governor of New York State, was cultivated by men like Raskob; their attentions, coupled with disappointments in his personal political ambitions, led the former Governor away from the President. William Randolph Hearst, an utterly cynical man who sought to use the people for his own political advancement, denounced the President as a dictator. While communists worked ceaselessly to persuade the people that the answer to our economic problems was a planned society-production for use, and not for profit-fascist and Nazi propagandists worked with almost equal fervor to convince America that what this country needed was a strongman such as Italy and Germany had, a man who would put an end to a decadent democracy and replace it with the new, young and vibrant political philosophy of fascism. Some rich men, angry at labor's demands and Roosevelt's friendly attitude towards them, looked with favor on ending a political system which gave a man on relief as big a voice in who should run the country as a millionaire. Many industrialists were convinced that Roosevelt was a socialist, if not actually a card-carrying communist, and their hatred of the President was at times apoplectic-as when they denounced him as \\"that cripple in the White House.\\" <br /> <br />It was in this period that the fascist plot developed. <br />During the depth of the Depression, the growing talk of revolution prompted me to conduct a six-months survey of the country for a book I eventually published as America Faces the Barricades. I went to representative areas and talked with all classes, from those whose feet ached from the daily search for any kind of work to big landowners, industrialists and bankers. In the newspapers, over the radio and on street corners there was talk of revolution, but among the people themselves, no matter where I went, I found no such popular sentiment. Americans were in real trouble, but they did not want a revolution; they wanted jobs. I found only three groups who talked of the imminent revolution. One consisted of the big industrialists who were frightened by what aggressive trade unions were doing. The second included those pariahs of the social system who operated labor spy and strikebreaking organizations and fed employers reports that workers were talking of seizing the factories; when a union demanded more pay to meet rising living costs, its leaders were accused of being communists, communist-led, communist-dominated or communist dupes. The third group was the communists themselves, a very small organization with a maximum membership at its most influential period of about 80,000. These were the only groups that actually talked of revolution. <br /> <br />Hundreds of thousands-perhaps millions-of bewildered, frustrated and sometimes despairing people listened to the communists, but very few were interested in joining them. Like poverty-stricken people everywhere, Americans suffered in apathy. To them, communism and fascism were just words with connotations of un-Americanism; they did not know what the words stood for, but they knew they did not like either one. They believed in Americanism-though very few could have told you what that word stood for. Americans no more wanted a revolution than they did in 1776. I wrote articles on what I found for both conservative publications, such as the American Mercury, and for communist ones. I must say this for the communist leaders and editors: though my findings often contradicted reports sent in by their own district organizers in the field, no attempt was made \\"to edit or cut them or insert anything to slant my stories to fit the \\"party line.\\" <br /> <br />Source: Excerpts from a chapter in John Spivak's A Man in His Time, \\"The Plot To Seize Washington\\" pp. 294-298.	2005-03-30

They were darker, more realistic, and less jingoistic. \\"One thing to keep in mind is that from the end of World War II to the early 1950s, comic books were just as much an adult medium as a children's medium,\\" explains Benton. \\"Many of the readers were young males in their 20s who missed World War II but had a desire ... to see war portrayed in a realistic fashion. Comic books allowed them to do that.\\"    A few titles of the early 1950s, particularly those published by Timely Comics (later known as Marvel Comics), trumpeted the glory of war. But for the most part, publishers emphasized the negative consequences of global conflict, particularly in terms of human loss.    \\"There was a certain navet to the superhero stories published during World War II, and that changed abruptly in the 1950s,\\" says William Savage Jr., a professor of history at the University of Oklahoma at Norman and author of Comic Books and America: 1945-1954 (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990).    \\"The only explanation I can come up with is that enough people ... in the comic book industry had participated in World War II and emerged from it with firsthand knowledge of what war was really like,\\" says Savage. \\"It was a 180-degree turn from the gung-ho optimism of the World War II period to an almost totally pessimistic view of the individual in a combat situation. In my opinion, the war comics published during the Korean War were really the only antiwar literature of the day.\\"	2005-03-21

Although the first two stories are unfocused and somewhat heavy-handed, despite some wonderfully bizarre imagery, the remaining 10 tales are provocative and surprising. Many explore the blurred boundary between objective and subjective reality--in \\"Stalin's Teardrops\\" the efforts of Soviet mapmakers to obscure the geographical truth actually create alternative landscapes. Others are flavored with the surreal: in \\"The Human Chicken\\" an eight-pound fowl is born to a bemused young couple. The best selections transform traditional story types into new tales. \\"The Beggars in Our Backyard\\" is a thinly disguised allegory that avoids tendentiousness, managing to provide both entertainment and social commentary. \\"The Pharaoh and the Mademoiselle\\" might have been a typical tale of an Egyptian curse, but Watson's idiosyncratic approach makes it truly unusual; half the story is related from the point of view of a set of tiny figurines and the other half takes the form of a play. From the regional flavor of \\"Tales from Weston Willow\\" to the quirkiness of \\"From the Annals of the Onomastic Society,\\" these stories offer a wealth of diverse, intelligent reading. <br />Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc. <br /> <br />From Kirkus Reviews <br />Another story collection from the prolific Watson (Salvage Rites, Evil Water, Slow Birds), this one comprising 12 tall tales published between 1985 and 1990. The longest piece here is brilliantly conceived: a company of Ushabti, tiny clay figurines placed in the sarcophagus of a pharaoh as his attendants, explore their sarcophagus-universe, then attempt to revive their dead master; what makes no stylistic or literary sense, and irredeemably flaws the story, is Watson's introduction of some investigating Egyptologists in the form of a play and, worse, chanting blank verse. Also noteworthy: the impressively imagined title yarn, which probes the strange consequences arising from deliberately distorted maps but all too soon meanders off into unfathomable byways; and a persuasive yarn that features the surrealist architect Gaudi. Elsewhere, three clumsily obvious metaphors (time travel and race hatred; rich vs. poor; a human chicken becomes chancellor of Oxford University) irritate rather than uplift; a jailer physically and psychically absorbs his prisoners; an English village hides odd goings-on; Sherlock Holmes ponders Cinderella, to astonishing effect; and an ayatollah's eyeball elicits only routine irony. Amazingly inventive--but too often inattentive or downright eccentric in the execution. -- Copyright 1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.	2005-01-17

This is interesting in terms of _when_ its \\"present\\" was (the early years of the Great Depression, and right when Hitler had taken power in Germany). It is also interesting to note that this was around the same time as _Last and First Men_, and that Stapledon and Wells, as two British socialist literary science fiction writers, almost certainly would have known one another in person. I wonder if there was some sort of informal challenge in their circle to try to \\"write about the future,\\" or something of that sort? <br /> <br />_The Shape of Things to Come_, of course, is a far less ambitious work than _Last and First Men_, in terms of scope. While LaFM covers two billion years of the history of not only our own species but its successors as dominant sapient races of the Solar System, TSoTtC covers only about a century (to the 2040's) in any sort of detail, and gives some vague hints of what happens out to 2100. This is roughly 110 to 166 years past the point of publication, corresponding to the very earliest parts of Stapledon's book in terms of timescale. <br /> <br />The framing story is that this is the \\"dream book\\" (recording of a series of dreams experienced by) of Dr. Phillip Raven, a progressive-minded statesman, influential in the League of Nations, who died in 1930. As becomes apparent to his friend (presumably H. G. Wells himself), the dreams were accurately prophetic (he foretells the election of FDR among other things), channelling a history book written in 2106, and so Wells decides to write them up into this history of the future. <br /> <br />I say \\"history of the future\\" rather than \\"novel\\" with precise meaning. Like _Last and First Men_, _The Shape of Things to Come_ is not really a novel: it has very little characterization and indeed few named characters engaging in anything like normal dialogue or plot. It's actually set up as if it really were a history of the last 200 years, writen in 2106 (as it claims to have been). The only places where it's dramatic is where one might expect a well-written, lively sort of history book to be so. <br /> <br />This of course ruins it as a novel, but then that's never what Wells was aiming at. He was aiming at a \\"future history,\\" and as such this book really has more in common with works such as the _Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology_ than with science fiction _novels_ in general. <br /> <br />It's interesting to note that both TSoTtC, and LaFM, were written several years before the earliest story in Heinlein's famous \\"future history.\\" I wonder if Heinlein read either book before coming up with _his_ notion of a \\"future history?\\" Wells was, of course, quite famous by the late 1930's / early 1940's, both as a fiction writer and a serious futurist. <br /> <br />The work is divided into five \\"books,\\" each the length of a short history book. The first: \\"Today and Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns,\\" is Wells' precis of the history of the world from roughly 1914-1933, as it might be seen from the viewpoint of his fictional 2106. It is, as one might expect, essentially socialist and pessimistic in view: Wells believed that Western Civilization had lost and was continuing to lose tremendous opportunities of education, production, and progress owing to what he saw as the pernicious effects of capitalism and superstition. He also had by this time lost almost all hope that the Soviet Union was going to turn out any better than Western Europe had. This part is somewhat amusing in terms of exposing Wells' own views, but is less than fascinating even viewed as history (and I like to read history). Wells himself would do this sort of thing _far_ better in his famous _Outline of History_. <br /> <br />The second book,\\"The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration,\\" is essentially about the wreck of Civilization. Basically, the Great Depression (which he calls \\"the Slump\\") gets worse and worse. In 1935, Franklin Delano Roosevelt calls The London Conference in which all the nations of the world try to come to an agreement to end it: they fail miserably and the Depression continues to deepen. <br /> <br />(this follows logically from Wells' own socialist views: if the Depression was caused by the limitations of capitalism, obviously nothing short of a complete restructuring of the economy towards socialism could cure it). <br /> <br />(in our time line, of course, what happened was that the Depression partially lifted in 1934, and conditions gradually improved throughout the 1930's; finally, World War II caused governments everywhere to demand massive war production that put an end to it once and for all. Wells, embarassingly, was to see his theory proven false _within one year after the publication of the book_, which may be why there isn't any mention of a Depression On Steroids in the movie version). <br /> <br />Anyway, things get worse and worse, socially as well as economically. Production of whole classes of goods ceases (this is logically inconsistent with the structure of a Depression, but Wells isn't a very good economist). Crime and despair spread. <br /> <br />In 1940, the Germano-Polish War starts, by accident, over the Danzig Corridor. A Nazi shoots a Polish man at a train station, and Poland invades Germany and drives a good way into the Eastern part of the country before being stopped by German fortifications. <br /> <br />(this is the same year that \\"the Second World War\\" starts in the movie, but in the movie we never learn the cause of the war or even the identity of the foe) <br /> <br />Germany and Poland trade continual air raids while their ground armies are locked in stalemate on massive trench lines, including extensive poison gas and anti-tank obstacles ... <br />(continued on google groups)	2005-01-16

Just two years later she published her first novel, Shadow on the Hearth, one of the few novels she was to write. In 1956 she started two things that went on to have great impact on science fiction: she helped organize the first Milford SF Writers Conference, and she edited the first of twelve annual Best SF anthologies for Dell. In 1968 she edited an influential anthology of British New Wave SF, England Swings SF, and later that year she moved to Canada as protest to the Vietnam War. She made a gift of her personal collection to the Toronto Public Library in 1970, founding the Spaced Out Library (which was later renamed the Merril Collection).

It's also a very handsome artifact,with a dust jacket depicting a globe toppled from its stand with a vulture perching atop it, against a backdrop of charcoal and violet smoky sky and stylized ruins. Since the SF ENCYCLOPEDIA entry on (Oswald) Herbert Best is so cursory, let me quote the back flap: <br /> <br />HERBERT BEST <br />Author of _The Twenty-Fifth Hour_--    and Expert on Primitive Life <br /> <br />Readers and others who have seen this book in advance of publication have commented on the authentic touch with which Herbert Best has reconstructed the primitive life into which the world reverted in mid-century after the devastation of wars and plagues.  They have been particularly interested in his picture of the germ of civilization trying to re-establish itself in North Africa on the basic groundwork of tribal laws and customs.  Mr.   Best handles this phase of his story with such confidence because he was in both Palestine and Egypt with Allenby during the first World War; later he joined the British Civil Service and was sent to North Nigeria, West Africa, as Administrative Officer, where he spent many years in the    study of the anthropology and ethnology of that part of the world.  He acted as judge, treasurer, tax collector, roadmaker, bridge builder, surveyor, sheriff, coroner and even executioner. In his spare time he learned more or less thoroughly two dozen native tongues with their attendant customs and folklore.  In short, he was the typical British Civil Service representative of the empire on which the sun never sets.  He holds the degrees of B.A. and LL.B. from Queens' College, Cambridge, and is an F.R.G.S. The authentic flavor of that part of the story laid in the Caribbean stems from an official residence of several years in the Virgin Islands which allowed him to do much cruising about in his own small boat.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The blurb on the dust jacket says: \\"How true a prophecy is this novel of the future wherein a man, possibly the last representative of civilization in Europe, and a woman, certainly the last in the Western hemisphere, <br />are brought together in a world laid waste by totalitarian wars?\\" This is sort of the respectable twin of FINAL BLACKOUT. It also has one of the world's great dust jackets, with a vulture sitting on top of a toppled globe against a background of ruins and violet smoke. Haunt the second hand stores for 20 or 30 years and you might find a copy, or L.W. Currey will probably sell it to you for a hundred bucks. Seriously, folks, a great book that someone should reprint.\\" <br /> <br />\\"This is FINAL BLACKOUT's literate twin, a very good book that to my knowledge has never been reprinted and is completely forgotten (except by Fritz Leiber, who quoted from it in his novella \\"The Night of the Long Knives\\" a/k/a \\"The Wolf Pair\\").\\"	2005-01-16

Just two years later she published her first novel, Shadow on the Hearth, one of the few novels she was to write. In 1956 she started two things that went on to have great impact on science fiction: she helped organize the first Milford SF Writers Conference, and she edited the first of twelve annual Best SF anthologies for Dell. In 1968 she edited an influential anthology of British New Wave SF, England Swings SF, and later that year she moved to Canada as protest to the Vietnam War. She made a gift of her personal collection to the Toronto Public Library in 1970, founding the Spaced Out Library (which was later renamed the Merril Collection). In 1985 she edited the first volume of Tesseracts, which has become a successful series of Canadian short science fiction. She died in 1997 at age 74.	2005-01-16

Sequal is Dawn by S. Fowler Wright (1929)    \\"'Deluge' is an archetypal disaster story in which a geographical upheaval causes the greater part of Britain to sink beneath he sea, turning the Chilterns into an archipelago of tiny islands. The hero plays a key role in helping to restore some semblance of social order out of the violent anarchy which follows. The book is a direct ancestor of the similarly structured novels which John Wyndham and John Christopher wrote in the 1950s. The story was continued in a sequel, 'Dawn' (1929 in the US; 1930 in the UK), but a projected third volume was never written. Because so many copies were printed, the US edition of 'Deluge', published by Cosmopolitan, is much more common than the relatively scarce Fowler Wright edition, while Cosmpolitan's edition of 'Dawn' is also easier to find than the later UK edition.\\"    \\"Film rights to his novel 'Deluge' (1927), which he printed himself some seven years after writing it, were sold to Hollywood, and the US edition of the novel then became a bestseller.\\"    \\"He is a collectible author both here and in the USA, and the recent rediscovery of the film version of 'Deluge' - which had been thought lost save for the often used special effects footage of the inundation of New York - may help to re-ignite interest in his work. (The film was screened in some USA cinemas in 1994, but has not yet been shown in the UK.)\\"	2005-01-15

The latter are sent over enemy and allied territories alike to demonstrate Britain's might, and a test bomb accidentally destroys a U.S. cruiser, a United Fruit ship, and much of Florida. A renegade minister boldly seizes the initiative in the furor which follows and imposes universal disarmament. The earliest atomic muscular disarmament novel.\\" <br /> <br />\\"In 1932 Harold Nicolson, diplomat and biographer (also the husband of Vita Sackville-West), published another early muscular disarmament novel, Public Faces; in it the British impose universal disarmament through their monopoly of atomic bombs delivered by rockets strongly resembling cruise missiles. Nicolson's weapons are far more powerful than those of Wells: one dropped off the coast of Florida creates a tidal wave which kills eighty thousand people, shifts the course of the Gulf Stream, and permanently alters the climate. Nicolson was less interested in technical matters than in the political maneuvering of the great powers in which peace and British supremacy are ensured by the boldly illegal stroke of an imaginative, headstrong minister.\\"	2005-01-15

The pair has been in a state of suspended animation for fifteen hundred years. Changes in the earth's features as well as monstrously mutated \\"humans\\" make it clear they have little hope of survival. The pair organize their resources to face the savage alternatives about them and the closeness created by their mutual interdependency inevitably kindles romance between Allan and Beatrice. <br /> <br />In Book Two, Beyond the Great Oblivion, Allan and Beatrice begin to discover the nature of the catastrophe that has split the Earth open. Rebuilding an airplane, they find a \\"bottomless\\" chasm near Pittsburgh where a huge portion of the Earth has been torn away to become a second moon. Alan and Beatrice earn the loyalty of the People of this Abyss and lead them from the chasm to New York. <br /> <br />In Book Three, The Afterglow, Allan and Beatrice, with the People of the Abyss, prepare to recolonize the Earth's surface. But first, they must defeat the devolved, cannibalistic survivors who populate Earth's cities. <br /> <br />Analog calls Darkness and Dawn \\"a classic trilogy,\\" while historian/critic Sam Moskowitz terms it \\"a masterpiece.\\"	2005-01-15

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	5	37	51	N	N	The negative reviewers are reviewing their own ideology	Don't let the 1-star reviewers persuade you, the negative reviewers are reviewing their own ideology, not the book.       IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NONE OF THOSE WHO ARE CRITICAL OF THE BOOK ACTUALLY >>READ<< THE BOOK.     The 1-star reviewers include:       >>> The \\"echo chamber\\" conservatives <<<     Reviewer STEPHEN M. BAINBRIDGE, according to his website, is a corporate law professor at the UCLA. He ironically happens to be one of the very \\"intellectuals\\" described in \\"What's the Matter with Kansas\\" who those conservative red staters typically despise.     It is obvious that Bainbridge, like most of the 1-star raters, relied on the echo chamber of those who share his own political views, to tell him whether Frank's book was a good book or not, without bothering to actually READ the book.     Bainbridge cut and pasted an article straight out of the Dec. 6 2004 Wall Street Journal \\"What's the Matter With Kansas? Not a thing, it turns out.\\"     If you read the article carefully it talks ONLY about unemployment figures. As one person commented, the big question is what kind of jobs and for what kind of money?   How many Kansas residents now have no health care?   The fact that Mr. Malanga fails to address such matters speaks volumes, and certainly doesn't help him refute Thomas Franks' thesis.     The author of this article, Steven Malanga, is also the author of the soon to be released book called: \\"The New New Left\\" which, according to the Amazon Product Description gives away his bias:     \\"The New New Left concentrates its political energies toward larger government and higher taxes-to benefit the public sector.\\"     Reviewer GREG FERGUSON \\"GFBOOK\\" is less indolent than Bainbridge, and actually regurgitates the Wall Street Journal article in his own words. But the same questions arise.     Reviewer RUSSELL C also rehashes the same article.         >>> The \\"Everything is just dandy in Kansas\\" conservatives <<<     Reviewer CATCHSOMEZZZZZZ obviously did not read the book.He wrote:     \\"There is also an assumption that Kansas is rural and blue collar.\\"     Franks explains in detail both the white collar and blue collar communities. In fact half of a chapter is devoted to Johnson County, which the author calls: \\"Cupcake land\\". \\"Cupcake land\\" is a predomently wealthy part of Kansas. (page 49)    Reviewer SCOTT M. STONE \\"A TRUE JAYHAWKER\\" also obviously did not read the book.     Both reviewers Scott, Wallaby, and Greg echoes what Franks said exactly, on pages 47-50. That there are two portions of Kansas, Johnson County and Garden City, which are booming.    Reviewer SCOTT wrote:     \\"Johnson County KS is the most prosperous part of the entire state\\"     Frank writes:     \\"Johnson County is a vast suburban empire, a happy, humming confusion of freeways and malls... It is the wealthiest county in Kansas by a considerable margin.\\" (page 49)    Reviewer SCOTT again shows that he obviously did not bother to read the book:     \\"I have a brother-in-law who worked for one of those infamous slaughterhouses\\"     Frank writes:     \\"The only other part of Kansas that had a winning formula...is around Garden City...Garden city is the future.\\" (page 51) Garden city is home of Tyson and the slaughterhouses Scott describes.         >>> The ignorant \\"stereo-typical\\" conservatives <<<     Reviewer NAOMI JAKOBS is described in detail in the book, but since she never read the book, she does not realize that she is actually one BIG stereotype.     Reviewer DR. EMIL SHUFFHAUSEN also is unknowingly the poster boy for many of the concepts that Frank explains.     SHUFFHAUSEN says:     \\"Democrats have referred to \\"my type\\" as uneducated\\" (Page 120)     He also uses many Conservative terms like:     \\"elites of Manhattan or West Hollywood\\"     This is actually discussed throughout the book.     Reviewer WALLABY \\"HERMIONE\\" also says the:     \\"show biz people who seem to think that they are political experts\\"     Reviewer DAVID L. MILLER like Bainbridge above,simply cut and pasted an article which fit his world view without bothering to read the book.     The author that DAVID cut and pasted obviously did not read the book either, because Franks DOES NOT:     \\"Tell people in a Red State what's wrong with them and how they should live.\\"     The author David quotes, is not aware that the Cold War was over a decade ago, because he attempts simplictic ad hominem attacks on Frank by associating him with Communism.     Again, the author David quotes is the poster boy for the concepts that Franks explains:     \\"We, the hoi polloi, are too stupid to know what is good for us.\\" \\"We are neither sufficiently intelligent\\"   \\"...unteachable ignorance of the Red States\\" (Page 120)         >>> \\"You CAN judge a book by it's cover\\" conservatives <<<     Reviewer JOHN R. MCCOMMAS   Also shows that you can judge an entire book by its cover, or at least its first three pages, John writes:     \\"(I went) into a store and read the first three pages\\"     His review says nothing of substance about the book.     Reviewer WALLABY \\"HERMIONE\\" shows that you CAN judge an entire book by its cover, without the first three pages:     \\"I was turned off immediately by the reviewers on the cover\\"         >>> Read the book and decide for yourself! <<<     And the negative reviews continue, rehashing the same themes.     Please ignore these negative folks, and take the time to read the book, it will change the way you see American politics.       From the Rocky Mountain News (Denver, CO) December 28, 2004:     The answers Frank gives may not always be persuasive, yet his combination of a scholar's depth of learning with a prose style that is anything but academic make him that rarest of creatures: a public intellectual who might actually change a few minds.     In any case, whether one agrees with his conclusions or not, Frank asks exactly the right question:   How did a nation that enacted the New Deal and the Great Society come to want to transform itself into the equivalent of a Country Club Christian Church?	2005-01-07
