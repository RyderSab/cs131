As always, Jemima Shore finds herself surrounded by a cast of fascinating, eccentric characters, almost any of  whom could be a murderer.  Fraser is remarkably good at creating vivid  characters, and none perhaps so vivid as Jemima Shore herself.

I once read a quote by Stephen King in which he said that the critics tore CHRISTINE to shreds.  Why?  This may not be the best book he's ever written, but it's a very good, solid chiller nevertheless.  This is the  only book of King's I've read that I felt was too long.  Sure, THE STAND is  much longer, but it is as long as it needs to be; CHRISTINE could have been  shortened by a hundred pages or so and still been an exciting story,  possibly even more so.  But again, King has created characters you cannot  help but take interest in, and like the best of his books, this one is not  only scary, but also rather sad.  My only real complaint was to have Roland  LeBay be the source of the evil rather than the car itself; somehow, to me,  that idea took away from the horror rather than adding to it.  Still, like  just about everything by Stephen King, this is well worth reading.	2000-02-09

This is definitely one of Christie's best novels; it has a psychological depth and complexity that even Christie seldom achieved.  As Poirot sets himself to investigating a sixteen-year-old murder, we get the facts as  described by the various characters; we see the divergence of opinion and  the varying points of view as each character recalls the crime and the  events surrounding it.  Special attention must be paid to the dialogue;  things overheard and misinterpreted play a large role.<br />A real gem.	2000-02-07

This is probably Agatha Christie's best-known book (largely because it is the only one that made a really good movie).  It is an exceptionally atmospheric book; there is something haunting about a train caught in a snowdrift miles from nowhere.  The solution, oddly enough, is not really  much of a surprise; Poirot's investigation proceeds in such a way that you  do see the solution coming before it is revealed.  But I think this was  intentional on Christie's part (her plotting is so beautifully precise that  it is hard to think she would make such a slip).  Also, the lack of  surprise at the end is more than made up for by the exceptional (even for  Christie) attention to detail shown here; this is certainly a triumph for  Poirot as well as Christie.	2000-02-04

Sure, this book is long, but there's very little wasted space.  The final hundred pages or so might have been shortened just a little, but basically, everything King has put into this massive work belongs there; to cut it would be a crime.<br />This is a different sort of horror story; the horror is  a man-made one.  Here we have King exploring the extent to which the human  race can be its own worst enemy, as well as its own best friend.<br />Normally  I don't much care for the &quot;Hand of God&quot; sort of ending, but this  is fantasy; anything can happen.<br />You bleed for these people as they  suffer through the grim sequence of events; watching their friends,  neighbors, and loved ones die by the millions; feeling alone and  devastated; gradually finding each other and trying to regain some reason  for hope.<br />By the way, this made a pretty darn good miniseries; I was  quite surprised how faithfully the book was adapted to television.<br />I  don't know if I would call this King's masterpiece - he really is at his  very best with out-and-out horror stories - but this is certainly a rich,  powerful, and very moving human story, very much worth reading (and please,  read the complete version).	2000-02-04

It's odd to note that Lady Antonia Fraser, famous for her historical biographies, decided to try writing mysteries as a lark; she turns out to be the best mystery writer I have read since Agatha Christie!  Possibly  that's because, unlike so many other mystery writers, she does not copy or  imitate Christie, Doyle or the other old masters of the genre.  Instead, in  Jemima Shore, she has created a startlingly original character; one who  does not resemble any literary detective of the past.  Fraser is also great  at characterization (one of Christie's weak points); her creations are  vivid and frighteningly real.  This is her first Jemima Shore novel; sadly,  many of the others are out of print, but if you can find them, read them.	2000-02-01

These four stories are indeed &quot;Different Seasons&quot; for King; there is virtually nothing supernatural happening here (except for a slight touch in &quot;The Breathing Method&quot;).  These four excellent novellas  are proof positive that King is a terrific writer whatever genre he's  working in; horror may be his forte, but it is by no means the extent of  his range. Having said that, while these are not horror stories, there is  nevertheless that unmistakable King atmosphere to each of them: a trifle  creepy, unsettling, and even frightening.  Yet these are not &quot;horror  stories&quot; in the traditional sense.  They are stories about life (and  death); each of them (though this is a bit of a stretch in the case of  &quot;The Breathing Method&quot;) has a feeling that the events told here  could actually have happened.	2000-01-18

David Leavitt writes with such feeling and sensitivity that you really feel you get to know the people in his stories.  His portraits of the young gay man coming out, the middle-aged closet case, and  the wife who gradually grasps the fact of her husband's secret life, are  done with such depth and understanding that we feel for everyone involved.   Leavitt does not take a noticeable stance in favor of either side; one of  his gay men is a self-involved jerk who evokes little sympathy, though one  does pity him, in a way.  Leavitt's novel, in short, is about human beings,  with all our faults and foibles.  This one will stay with you long after  you finish reading it.  Lovely and heart-wrenching.	2000-01-14

THE ABC MURDERS is one of Christie's most complex books; the clues and red herrings fall thick and fast, and the plotline is perhaps the most misleading she ever wrote.  The plot deals with a series of murders which  seem to have a specific and clear pattern to them.  The incredible thing  about this book is that the reader is quite convinced that he knows what is  going on and where the case is headed, up to about the halfway point, where  the entire plot twists itself into a pretzel, and the reader is completely  lost for a while (as is Hastings), until the shocking conclusion.  After  reading this one (and so many other Christie's), all I could say was,  &quot;Well, she's done it again!&quot;  Thrilling reading from start to  finish.	2000-01-13

I was truly astounded by this book.  Having grown up in a Christian home, I had heard all the scriptures supposedly regarding gay people many times.  Reading this book was a true revelation.  I never realized the impact of  thousands of years of rewrites and (mis)translations upon the Bible.   Moreover, Boswell has researched the history and customs of the ancient  world with a remarkable degree of thoroughness, especially when one  considers that the available material must of necessity be somewhat  fragmented and disjointed due to the passage of so much time.<br />Gay people  who are still struggling for self-acceptance must read this book.  It was  one of the greatest comforts to me to discover that homophobia and  Christianity are not related to each other.<br />Homophobic so-called  Christians would also do well to read this book, although, having read some  of the other reviews posted here, I suppose that people who have made up  their minds to hate will continue to do so no matter what.	2000-01-13

After the seductive perfection of her original trilogy, Rice has taken Lestat (whom she is obviously besotted with) and jettisoned all the rest of  the characters we came to know and love in the first three books.  Also,  the story takes the vampire legends way out into left field, with Lestat  actually inhabiting a mortal's body.  Interesting stuff, but Lestat on his  own gets tiresome; I found myself hoping that Louis or Armand or Marius  would show up.  After a certain point, without the others as a buffer,  Lestat becomes quite tedious and the book ends up being boring.  Somehow  this volume doesn't fit with the first three; Ms Rice should have left it  as a trilogy.	2000-01-13

But WHY does EVERYBODY seem to HATE  &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden! &quot;  While not as exciting and  action-oriented as &quot;The Langoliers,&quot; this story rates high on my  list because the horror is internal; the emphasis here is on relationships  (read DOLORES CLAIBORNE).

Christie, who worked in a dispensary during World War I, had a certain amount of technical knowledge of various poisons; thus her fondness for it  as a weapon in her books.  Poison can be used by anyone; it is therefore  the perfect weapon for Christie.  This one is a particularly jolly romp  complete with illicit affairs and mistaken identities.  Light in tone, this  is not one of her more serious books, but it is extremely clever and, as  always, entertaining.	2000-01-10

There are other Christie books that are more exciting or more  clever than this, but she is in top form here.  Characterizations have a  bit more psychological depth here than in her other books; the monstrous  mother and the near-psychotic daughter, in particular, stand out as  memorable creations.<br />Read the book and the play; Christie adapted the  novel for the stage herself, and made two changes: she removed Poirot, and  changed the identity of the murderer.  Typical of Christie, both versions  of the story work equally well.	2000-01-07

King's first effort does not at all seem the work of a novice.  I loved the device of using excerpts from books and articles  supposedly written about Carrie White and Prom Night; these chapters give  an almost documentary feel to the book.  In fact, for some reason, this  book reminds me vaguely of HELTER SKELTER, which was, of course, a true  story.  <br />Another thing that lends atmosphere to this is King's use of  parentheses to show the reader his characters' thoughts and impressions  (did he invent this?  I can't think of another author who does this),  giving the reader a real feeling of identity with the characters.  <br />It is  also a very moving book; in addition to being a jolly good horror story,  the characters evoke real feelings of sympathy.  Carrie's plight is a  familiar one; King evokes the middle-class high school pecking order with  devastating accuracy, and the story, ultimately, is not only scary, but  very sad.<br />It made a very good movie, incidentally. I recommend both.   I've read a lot of Stephen King, but this one is still my favorite.	2000-01-06

It's a bit over-ambitious; the young Christie was heavy-handed  with the clues in this one, and while the ending is a surprise, the last  section of the book is just a bit too long for the ending to have quite the  impact that Christie would achieve in later works.  This is perhaps the  only Christie book about which one can say there are &quot;too many  clues;&quot; it is nonetheless an astounding achievement for a first-time  author.

I am a huge fan of Stephen King, but as far as I'm concerned, he dropped the ball on this one.  Don't get me wrong; this book is as scary and atmospheric as anything he has written.  Most of it is very good, and the  length did not bother me until I got to the end.  The payoff, where what  &quot;IT&quot; is is revealed, was so lame and unconvincing (I won't say  what it turned out to be, but it was an old, tired horror-movie cliche)  that I was completely turned off.  I couldn't help feeling that King spent  most of the time he was writing this book with absolutely no idea what the  mysterious monster was going to be.  That's why the book starts out so  well; as long as the mystery remains, it is a gripping, scary story.  But  when the time came to reveal the monster, I can't help but feel that King  just couldn't come up with anything, so he threw together a slapdash ending  and stuck it on the book to meet his deadline.  a MAJOR disappointment.	2000-01-05

Here we have a devoted couple; the husband is distracted by a  grasping beauty, and murder ensues.  Christie's handling of this theme is  always sure-footed (possibly due to the breakup of her own first marriage  due to a philandering husband); here she takes these commonplace elements  and twists them to produce an end result that will lift the reader out of  his chair.  There are, perhaps, more exciting Christies, but this is quite  satisfying and interesting.  After all, the lady wrote a tremendous number  of books and short stories; they can't all be her &quot;best.&quot;  See  how many different variations on this theme Christie was capable of in  &quot;Five Little Pigs,&quot; &quot;Death On the Nile,&quot; &quot;Towards  Zero,&quot; and &quot;The Hollow,&quot; in which the triangle is more of a  square, with four sides instead of three.	2000-01-04

This one is about a group of four mysterious people whose &quot;aim is world  domination,&quot; making this read more like a James Bond movie than what  you'd normally expect from Christie.  Forget any hard detection; the plot  twists are extremely silly and credibility flies out the window early on.  <br />I still gave it three stars, however, for two reasons.  First, it has  Poirot and Hastings, and their teamwork, their sparring, their unique  quality is just as much in evidence here as anywhere else.  Second, as is  usual with Christie, it is still entertaining and clearly written.  So just  don't take this one seriously; enjoy it for what it is.	1999-12-30

Sorry, Shelley, dear, but if you don't like confusing books, STAY AWAY FROM AGATHA CHRISTIE!   This is indeed a confusing book; Dame Agatha is at her most misleading here, directing the reader's attention to unimportant  bits of business or dialogue, focusing the reader on the trivia while she  floats the real clue softly past him.  The whole point of a Christie book  is to NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!   <br />This one is truly one of her  most deceptive books; you have to read extremely carefully (paying  particular attention to dialogue) in order to have a clue (pun intended) of  what's going on.  She writes with even greater care here than usual,  misdirecting the reader so effectively that the ending is a complete  surprise (it literally could be anybody until the last few pages! ).  One  of her classics.	1999-12-30

I am a big Stephen King fan; he has written so many terrific books, but 'salem's Lot, one of the first I read, is still one of his very best.  His handling of the classic vampire tale is stunning and his characters are  people you really care about (not always true of his later works).  This  lends an additional sense of horror; every time something happens to one of  the characters, you can hear yourself say, &quot;oh, no!&quot;  This of all  King's books has haunted me over the years; every so often I take it down  and re-read it, and it is just as scary and effective the twentieth time as  it was the first.	1999-12-27

This is possibly her very best of all.  As the figures vanish from the mantelpiece and the characters vanish from the scene one by one, the suspense she builds is almost  unbearable.  And the solution is dazzling (this from a lady who was an  expert at &quot;surprise&quot; endings); you simply won't believe it until  you read it!  Superb.	1999-12-21

Beautifully written and extremely low-key in approach, this tale of a contemporary house in suburban Atlanta (not even built at the start of the book) begins  almost innocently as the residents of the neighborhood discuss the house to  be built and speculate about the new neighbors.  But soon enough, things go  spiraling out of control as the residents of the house (and of the entire  neighborhood) are victimized and destroyed by the evil power the house  seems to have.  I've read this one almost to pieces; here the chills are  all the more effective because they seem as if they could actually happen,  somehow.  A gem.	1999-12-20

This is one of the most horrific things I have ever read.  The idea of a fog (actually a biological weapon gon awry) that causes madness is perhaps not  terribly original, but the results, described by Herbert with an almost  gleeful tone, are as horrible as anything ever dreamed of in the genre.   Grisly, gory, and gross, yet you can't put it down!   If you like to be  scared out of your wits, this one will do the job.	1999-12-20

All this, however, makes this novel somehow more affecting and horrifying than a more dramatic  approach would have.  This grisly tale of an evil child (told with  overtones of Satanism and Black Magic) set against the somewhat drab and  mundane backround of modern Liverpool, sets your teeth on edge from the  first page and holds you spellbound.  The undramatic way Campbell handles  his tabloid-style subject matter lends an extra chill to the book that  engulfs the reader as well.	1999-12-20
