Perhaps the relatively short length of the book should be a tip-off, because despite the potential, the normally good Cox ultimately leaves the reader hanging.<BR>  A reporter is taught to write who, what, where, when, and why? But this book consistently fails to answer the &quot;Why?&quot;  So many interesting stories that could be told, sadly aren't. Even as the book explains why some shows left the air, it really isn't explained why.  Similarly, why did shows like &quot;Dragnet&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; keep getting renewals, while, for example, Edgar Bergen or &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; were pulled from the airwaves in 1956.   Why did Jack Benny decide to pull out of radio and focus on television?   <BR>  Why did Amos 'n' Andy evolve into &quot;The Amos 'n' Andy Music Hall&quot;, Why did NBC decide to make &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; a 15-minute daily show? Why did some programs have no problem getting sponsors while the others were loaded with public service announcements in lieu of spots? <BR>  There is an endless list of questions that need to be answered. However, since the topic is interesting and the author is certainly capable, hopefully the subject matter can be expanded upon and done more thoroughly in a book that should run double its current length.<BR>  One final note, the author awkwardly avoids repeating the word &quot;network,&quot; which is essentially the best word to describe NBC, ABC, CBS, etc.  But to avoid repetition he awkwardly uses the word &quot;chain&quot; (which, to be fair was what Gosden and Correll called their method of syndication) and the word &quot;web,&quot; which even when the book was written was associated more with the Internet and certainly is not used with familiarity when describing a radio network such as NBC or CBS.	2004-07-01

More importantly, the Singer book is one of the few fair and balanced looks at Godfrey's lengthy, yet ultimately forgotten career.<br />  I can't say enough for Singer's style of writing.  There's one passage in particular where he describes what it's like being in a radio studio, down to the smell of the equipment. As a broadcaster for nearly 20 years, he hit it on the head.<br />  Also, Singer does a very good job of chronicling Godfrey's career through its ups and downs, but also, more importantly, through the transitional phases radio and television would make, in which Godfrey would wind up back again as primarily a radio personality in the 60s and early 70s, only to have him struggle to adapt into the later 70s and early 80s.<br />  Even if you've never heard of Arthur Godfrey, if you're a student of broadcasting, this will be an important book to learn about the experiences of one of the world's first multi-media superstars. Long before Howard Stern, Arthur Godfrey was the king of all media.	2004-01-25

Here, Paris is referring to someone who's 40 or over, but he also stresses that at even younger ages, the body begins to change, and someone in their mid-30s may even start to notice diminished testosterone levels.<br />Unfortunately, ego and pride will keep the people who need to read this book the most from actually doing so.  If you workout at a gym, chances are you'll see someone there who's not 20 or 25, oblivious to the fact that he needs to adapt his workout to meet the changes his body has undergone as a result of aging. Thankfully Paris talks about the importance of recovery---the aspect of lifting that eludes so many lifters.<br />Hopefully people will keep an open mind and read this book as they move through their 30s.  When I was in my late 20s and early 30s, Paris' &quot;Flawless&quot; was a challenging workout.  Now that I'm older, there's no way I could endure that rigorous a workout and get the results I did back then.<br />The key to remember is, that if you adapt your workouts to your age, they'll be more productive and you WILL see better results than someone who's only fooling himself by trying to fool his body.	2004-01-01

Nor do most people know who Jim and Marian Jordon were.  <br />But for the curious, those who want to know more about the show, this is the book to read.  Not only because it is well-researched with interviews with Jim Jordon and others, but also it is full of photographs of Jim and Marian both before and during their years at 79 Wistful Vista.<br />Listeners to the show know it evolved over the years.  The earliest episodes are almost unenjoyable and bear little resemblance to the show at its height. Why did the show evolve?  Look here to find out. Favorite characters would come and go.  But where do you turn to find out why?  This book!  And what was behind the &quot;Fibber McGee's closet&quot; routine?  How and why did it come about? This will tell you why.  How did the show handle the drafting of many of its most important stars during World War Two?  Turn to these pages.   Why did Johnson Wax end sponsorship? And why did the Jordans decide against playing the roles on television?  This is the definitive book to answer those questions.<BR>  Easy-to-read type; single space, packs a lot of fact on the page. <BR>  This book is invaluable!	2003-10-30

There are a host of modern translations out there which more easily lend themselves to the reader of today. <BR>  If you're a biblical scholar, there are a host of debates that can be aired over the various translations of the Bible, the books omitted (Maccabees, etc.) But for the average reader who's just trying to read the Holy Bible, unless ye haveth an uncontrollable urge to read as thy forefathers read, why not read a more modern translation?	2003-10-12

Each part of this book looks at the Columbine-like shooting, its aftermath, and the long-range effects on the characters.<BR>  The father character is the most problematic, but the final chapter, written from his perspective, is the key to understanding what this book and Coupland's message is all about.  The spiritual themes that Coupland has explored in each of his books (especially &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot;) is once again brought front and center.  The final paragraph of the book and its apochryphal nature make you stop and re-consider the Biblical themes that have been carried through the course of the overall story.  Rather than rejecting religion, Coupland once again, appears to be presenting in a modern context, very debates about Christianity, and what its preachings really are about, as opposed to the way many of its detractors---and some of its most-ardent practitioners---understand its message to be.	2003-10-12

(Can ye readeth the King James Version without thy head aching?)  The New International Version and this mass market paperback make the Bible easily accessible to the modern reader. The type is a little small, and hopefully a Large Print version will be made to the average consumer.<br />  Reading this book is essential. Even if you're an agnostic, an athesit, or what have you, the writings from Genesis to Revelation are very compelling.  If you read the reviews for the King James Version elsewhere on the site, you'll see there are many who give it a poor review simply because they're atheists. But when you get down to the basic substance, the messages of the Bible, (the way people should treat one another, not judge others, try to improve themselves, love your neighbor, don't commit murder, put others' needs before your own) are really difficult to hold in contempt.  Indeed, Matthew 5-7 could easily be marketed as a self-help book.<br />  The Bible is timeless, and at least this translation and edition help the modern reader.  For what it's worth, it will probably take roughly one year to read the Bible from cover to cover, but given its importance, it's worth it.	2003-10-12

After all, we're talking about blacksmiths, pirates, and so on.  Hardly things the average teenager of the 2000s can relate to.<BR>   But if you're in your twenties, thirties, or forties, this book is as compelling a novel as you'll ever read. It's an opportunity to look back at Pip and ourselves, the great expectations we all have, and the major surprises, disappointments, and regrets of life.<BR>   The adult reader can understand the vindictiveness of Miss Havisham, the pride of Magwitch, the true and rare friendship of Herbert Pocket, and, of course, Estella. Each man has in his life an Estella.<BR>   Beyond the true-to-life tale of hope and defeat, is the wry humor throughout the book that a more mature reader can appreciate.<BR>  Surprise yourself.

While the author does a commendable job of presenting an interesting look at the life of America's favorite redhead, much of this book simply reads too much like others that came before. For example, the \\"I Love Lucy\\" years read very much like Bart Andrews' \\"The 'I Love Lucy' Book.\\"  The post-Desi era reads much the same as \\"Desilu,\\" which remains the definitive book about this subject.  In many cases, the exact same stories are repeated: Lucy collecting pencils after the stockholders meetings, Young Lucille Ball eating leftover donuts and buying coffee with someone else's tips at a diner, etc.  Sadly, if you've read other books about Lucille Ball or \\"I Love Lucy,\\" you won't need to read this book, because it's pretty much a rehash of everything you've read before.<BR>  What's more, the author starts with a good premise, trying to examine what it is about Lucille Ball that made her less than a rousing success in film, yet when presented in the brilliant weekly sitcom \\"I Love Lucy,\\" she was able to become the most beloved figure in entertainment. Yet you have to wait until the final chapter for that.  This would have made an interesting and well-written magazine article, but as a book, it simply presents too much of what has already been told.<BR>  In the end, reading the book is like watching an \\"I Love Lucy\\" rerun that you've already seen several times before. It may be enjoyable, but in the end, you know what's coming before it happens.	2003-08-23

Paley and the Birth of Modern Broadcasting	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Upclose Look at Media Giant	This book has been out for as long as it has, and no reviews? It's been about five or six years since I've read it, but this volume is a must-read for anyone considering a career in broadcasting, or if you're interested in the building of a corporate empire.<BR> The book takes us from Paley's somewhat well-to-do background and takes us, in all his glory, (which the book's author uses sarcastically), from cigar maker to the head of one of the most powerful corporations in American history, what used to be CBS, Inc.<BR>  The book doesn't necessarily portray Paley as a sympathetic character, but more of a small man who made it big. There's a heavy emphasis on the warts of the man, which may be somewhat understandable, since prior to this book's release, he was always presented as a man to be totally revered. But here he's portrayed as someone who likes to take credit for other's doings, as someone who plays petty head games with people such as Frank Stanton, and uses his on-air talent (Ed Murrow, for one) while it's convenient, and then when they're of no use to him anymore, casts them aside.<BR>  Despite the type of man Paley is presented as, this book is a very good chronicle of his career, which means it also is one of the definitive books on the creation of CBS. No matter what his personal flaws were, this is a man who did the impossible by challenging NBC to create the even more successful CBS radio network and then dominated television for roughly 20 years.  The building of that empire with the &quot;talent raids&quot; of Amos 'n' Andy, Jack Benny, and others is vital reading for anyone who is in the broadcasting industry.  What's even more essential, however, is watching the ideas and motivations that took the Columbia Broadcasting System to CBS, Inc, and how it lost focus as it became a corporate behemoth.  <BR>  Paley's death came several years before Westinghouse, and then Viacom, would acquire CBS, and having read this book, you can only imagine what he would have thought about how that played out.<BR>  One final note, while the book is lengthy, it's a breeze-through read. Once you get started, you won't put it down.	2003-07-26

Here is a collection of essays, book chapters, reviews, etc., dealing with Rodgers in each of his eras. They range from a Time magazine piece on Rodgers and Hart in the late 30s, to a Holiday magazine piece on Rodgers and Hammerstein in the late 50s. The collection helps give the reader an even better understanding of Richard Rodgers than he does in his own autobiography, because, as the editor notes, in the interviews that make up the final section, Rodgers is much more at ease and more glib.  <BR>    Some of the articles are a little technical in nature, with their study of Rodgers' musical compositions, but anyone familiar with his writings should be able to understand what they're referring to, by simply running the tune through your head as you analyze what's being discussed.<BR>   The book is hardly a whitewash, and is amazingly fair in its presentation of articles both friendly and not so friendly. For example, there's a chapter from Diahann Carroll's autobiography that paints Rodgers in a very unflattering light. <BR>   The collection is not only informative, but it's very entertaining.  While this book is good for people just getting familiar with Rodgers, it's probably best suited for the well-versed scholar, who will enjoy this research packed together in a handy volume, eliminating the need to head to the library's microfilm collection.  Also, the editor does a very good job of pointing the reader to other articles that were not included (usually because of the cost, as he mentions in the foreword)<BR>but present an opposing view or elaborate further on an idea.<BR>Great job!	2003-01-27

Hugh Fordin writes a wonderful book that looks at the personal and the professional side of America's pre-eminent lyricist.<BR>  While fans of Richard Rodgers may be more inclined to enjoy the cynical wit of Larry Hart's lyrics, after reading this book, you can't help but be made into a Hammerstein convert.  Here's a man with a sunny disposition, who believed in happy endings, and the best in people.  One of the most telling stories Fordin recounts is how Hammerstein wrote &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; (a pre-Rodgers song) because he was devastated by the fall of France in 1940. He would later point to that as the worst day of his life... not finding out his first wife had been cheating on him. That's the sort of guy Oscar Hammerstein comes across as in this book.<BR>   You'll also explore his early high-water mark of &quot;Show Boat&quot; and its important role in American Theater, followed by his pre-Rodgers drought.<BR>    If you read this book, you'll be glad you've Gotten to Know Him.	2003-01-10

In the preface to this landmark book on the Eisenhower presidency, Greenstein talks about how he had begun a project on presidential leadership, with a quick stop at the Eisenhower Library to get confirmation that Eisenhower was as hands-off as possible, a doddering old fool who let his underlings run the country whilst Ike played golf. But as Greenstein looked at the research in front of him, he discovered Eisenhower was much more of a hands-on president than most accepted. He worked behind the scenes, however, hence this &quot;hidden-hand&quot; description.<br />Greenstein's book on Eisenhower is significant for all students of Eisenhower. Most revisionist scholars of Eisenhower were also Stevenson supporters in the '50s, and have come away with a better understanding of how Ike worked, and his handling of major crises. (Anyone who thinks the 1950s was &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; or &quot;Happy Days&quot; is poorly mis-informed and needs to take himself to the public library to look at all the brinksmanship reported in the newspapers and newsmagazines of the time.)<br />In this book, Greenstein offers his argument, and then goes through a series of case-studies to look at how Eisenhower worked actively behind the scenes to accomplish his goals. <br />This is indeed a landmark book for scholars. The general reader, however, may be overwhelmed by the academic use of language. For them, the two-volume book on Eisenhower by Ambrose may be a better book to read.	2003-01-04

Presumably, this mean the films are being studied in film classes in our colleges and universities, which means academia is giving these films the respect they deserve.<BR> <BR> Essays look at the Stillman's ability to persuade typically reluctant audiences to accept many of the values and conventions educated people are usually taught to scorn.  They range from American foreign policy in the Cold War, to disco music, to the writings of Dale Carnegie.<BR>  While obviously written for use as a film studies textbook, these essays are also easy enough to understand and enjoy for the average reader as well.<br />  Here's hoping the book soon becomes outdated as Stillman turns out a series of additional films. But until then, these essays look at three of the most brilliant movies of the 1990s. Enjoy them, and then enjoy reading about them, too.	2003-01-03

This is an important chronicle of the date of infamy for our generation, and lets us re-live that horrific date through the medium most Americans experienced it:  television. The DVD is a 2-hour long documentary of CBS News coverage of 9/11 and the aftermath of the Attack on America.  We see Bryant Gumble talk to witnesses of the first plane crash, as a second one flies into the South Tower, to the astonishment of everyone. Then, we see the Pentagon in flames. We can hear in the &quot;Oh my goodness!&quot; of Gumble, a certain tone, that something that will forever change our nation has just happened.<br />&quot;What We Saw&quot; includes in text, photos, and the DVD the story of the Attack on America, but also more importantly, the way the nation responded.  Personally, I wish the DVD contained some things left behind.  Who can forget, having watched television on 9/11/01, the site of Congressional leaders announcing how they'd support the President, spontaneously singing &quot;God Bless America&quot; in unison.  Who could forget the President's attempts to calm the nation that night, when no one knew if we were about to be hit again.  Who could forget watching President Bush in an informal briefing in the Oval Office choke back tears the following Thursday as he said, &quot;I'm a loving man,&quot; but vowed to bring justice to those responsible.  Who could forget the emotionally draining memorial service on the National Day of Mourning, September 14, 2001?  That service at least is included in a John Roberts report on how President Bush become Comforter-in-Chief, but seeing more would have been a little more fulfilling.<br />The DVD also shifts from the attack itself, to the recovery. The heroes of 9/11, the people who made it out alive, the people who gave up their normal lives for weeks on end to volunteer at Ground Zero. These pieces from &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; &quot;48 Hours,&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; are very important reminders of how America recovered from the attack.<br />Ultimately, &quot;What We Saw&quot; is a story of hope, as an entire generation of Americans saw the darkest hour we'd ever known. And how, through that darkness, came a light of hope, that seemed at first to flicker, but would move beyond the clouds to provide sunshine as we lived through the finest hour our nation has known. That spirit of unity, love, devotion to duty is What We Saw. That's why &quot;What We Saw&quot; is necessary viewing for Americans for years to come.	2002-12-28

The word &quot;genius&quot; is over-used, but it really applies to Dorfsman. This book has ample examples of this man's brilliance.  When you think of CBS, chances are, you're thinking of the images of Dorfsman. The Eye. The Font. Everything anyone who watched CBS television or CBS radio from the 1950s to the 1970s knows what I'm talking about. Every aspect of that network's &quot;look&quot; was due to Dorfsman. <br />In an age when advertising seems more interested in impressing account executives than informing its audience, the classic work of Dorfsman provides an invaluable education. In fact, I'd bet if a radio or TV ad exec spent an hour looking at this book, seeking inspiration, he or she would probably be able to turn out much more effective ad campaigns than he or she are today.   His copy ranged from the minimalist (A list of the numbers 1-15, with two crossed out, copy saying &quot;These aren't ours,&quot; demonstrating how CBS dominated the daytime Nielsens) to the very convincing copy he generated to convince New Yorkers that they NEED to listen to WCBS with its new all-news format.<BR>History demonstrates how effective this material was in the 1960s.<br />Invaluable!

The author does present a new case about the Eisenhower family's business dealings in Abilene from the days before and up to Dwight's birth, but most of that is of little interest to scholars.  Plus, when it comes to sex and scandal, there's nothing really new here when it comes to Kay Summersby, and their alleged romance during World War Two. He says it didn't happen (and it probably didn't), but really doesn't provide the solid link of evidence to disprove it which the dust jacket hints it would.<BR>My biggest complaint about this book is someone was apparently asleep in the proofreading of it. There are a number of grammar errors and typographical errors, particularly in the early chapters. Also, someone needs to explain to the author why Ike and Mamie didn't have a radio in 1917 as they lived in cramped living quarters, because there was no commercial broadcasting in the United States until 1920.  And, of course, the book stops after Germany's surrender in World War Two. So this book never even looks at the development of NATO, Ike's tenure as Chief of Staff, Columbia University, or his years in the White House. Truthfully, much of this book relies on quotes not credited unless you read the footnotes from previous books. Readers looking for a gripping story that parallels the years of Eisenhower's life this book covers, should find a copy of Merle Miller's \\"Ike the Soldier.\\" It remains the most fascinating story about Eisenhower's years from Abilene until the end of World War Two. For a look at his post-war years preceding the 1952 election, turn to Ambrose. Ambrose's works on Eisenhower's presidency are also worth reading, and for scholarly works, there are voluminous writings.  As much as I hate to say it, choose one of those over this book.	2002-09-12

But while this is a nice, slightly-moody retelling of Superman's coming of age, and coming to terms with who he is, it really didn't leave me spellbound.

I was even back in high school when I found this book from my sister's Dale Carnegie course and began reading it.  While it's been nearly 20 years since I read this book, I've been carrying its principles ever since. The best part of this book and Carnegie's other landmark, &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People,&quot; is it's all common sense. Sometimes, it's so easy to see the obvious until it's pointed out to you and illustrated with very easy to understand anecdotes.  The book teaches you to live in day-tight compartments, to accept the worst-case scenario so you can be prepared to handle the consequences, to weigh the odds (Carnegie tells, for example, the story of how as a little boy he started crying because he thought he was going to be buried alive), etc.  You won't find a lot of psycho-babble here, just real life experiences from real people to deal with an all too real problem.	2002-04-21

While some may dismiss the book as being manipulative, the book stresses, developing a sincere interest in others. That's a \\"sincere\\" interest in others, not a phoney, \\"I-want-something-from-you-so-I'm-pretending-to-be-interested\\" interest in others. Other basic maxims of the book, such as smiling, being \\"lavish in your praise and hearty in your approbation\\" are as timeless today as they were in 1936.  Much of this book has become cliched, but that may be because there is something to these very basic principals. Again, the book stresses sincerity.  A phoney will be a fraud no matter how many creases he puts in the spine of this book.  Several years ago, I met some top economists from the Russian Republic visited my city, and mentioned what they learned from \\"Carnegie.\\" Everyone assumed they meant Andrew, until they had to point out, they meant Dale.  If Dale Carnegie is the source Russia turned to as it made its transition from communism to capitalism, doesn't it sound like something you ought to read?	2002-04-21

Through rich characterizations (Tom, St. Clare, Eva, Topsy, Ophelia, Cassy, Legree, etc), we discover a book about people.   Beecher Stowe examines slavery by making it very much a human issue, not only through the main characters, but also the stories told by those who pop up for a page or two. At times, the book is formulaic. You can bet each time, for example, that a mother and child face being sold, they will be separated, despite pleas to stay together.   And another way this book may seem out-of-place today, is the accidentally patronizing view the author may present of Africans.  \\"The Negro is inherently\\" she'll say from time to time; a flaw that is difficult to forgive for a book that otherwise does such a moving and successful job of creating real people for the reader to know.   These flaws aside, the book is compelling in its case by showing how despite the best wishes of people (two of Tom's three owners are good people who want him to be be freed), slavery was inherently evil, and that free states were duplicitous for allowing laws to permit slavery and to prosecute those helping slaves seeking freedom.  And while the phrase \\"Uncle Tom\\" has taken on a different meaning, a stereotypical \\"yes man,\\" don't overlook the strength in the actual character, or the strength and richness of Eliza and George Harris, surely two of the most non-stereotypical African-Americans to ever grace the pages of literature.	2002-02-21

It seems, no matter what problem Superman got himself into, those accursed robots would be called in from the Fortress of Solitude to give him a hand.  And Batman's utility belt was always full of what you needed. And characters like Green Lantern and Green Arrow could face whatever villains came their way in the Justice League series. But the problem was, comic books had to grow up to retain readers. What had been aimed largely at children before, began to broaden its audience as a means of survival. (Though if you have the actual comics from the 70s, you'll see the ads are still aimed at a juvenile audience.)  One of the first series to push the industry forward was the new Green Lantern/Green Arrow series. This is the O'Neill and Adams era (not included are the subsequent years when O'Neill handled the title with other artists), in which Green Lantern and Green Arrow began to confront inner demons. They'd look at problems in society.  True, most of this comes across as not always so subtle liberal propaganda, but when you look beyond the politics, you find amazingly talented writers and artists churning out a good product that makes you think (whether you agree or disagree with their conclusions.)  These days, almost all \\"important\\" comics require some near Armageddon scene, (think \\"Watchmen\\" or \\"Kingdom Come), but this title managed to talk about important issues without thinking it was even more important than those causes.  My only complaint, as pricey as this book is, it should have included the post Adams era.	2002-01-26

Like so many other books, it probably would have been better had he been able to wait a few months more to go more in depth about the September 11 terrorist attacks, but he still touches on them, and how they changed the Bush presidency.  Chris Matthews is fair. He's as opinionated, but not as bombastic as Bill O'Reilly.  True, he also interrupts his guests a lot, but this book will tell you why.  This book also sheds light on the media bias that Bernie Goldberg discusses in his book. Some of the things Matthews says in this book repeat what Goldberg says, without the appearance of axe-grinding. The only complaint, I wish this book were longer!	2002-01-26
US	51179915	R33LKZTZISLENM	0375401644	793131133	Somewhere for Me: A Biography of Richard Rodgers	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Impressive effort, especially regarding Rodgers' early days	&quot;Somewhere For Me&quot; is one of the better biographies of Richard Rodgers, focusing heavily on the personal life of the composer.  It's all here, warts and all. From his battles with the bottle, to his roving eye, his depression, hypochondria, and so on.  The book does focus heavily on his relationship with Dorothy Rodgers, but doesn't really attempt to explain why he strayed in their marriage.  Also, the book at times does focus a little bit too much on Dorothy, and Lorenz Hart, but Oscar Hammerstein, with whom Rodgers did his most significant writing, is almost pushed to the background. For example, the famous rift between the two after Hammerstein strived for some time to write &quot;Hello, Young Lovers,&quot; only for Rodgers to call the song &quot;adequate,&quot; is not even mentioned except in passing. And Hammerstein's ire over it is never mentioned.  As another reviewer writes, the film versions of the major Rodgers and Hammerstein films &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; were ones in which Rodgers was heavily involved.  The author also erronously states that the film of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; was viewed as unsuccessful in its initial release; and the immensely popular and heavily panned film of &quot;South Pacific&quot; only gets minimal mention. Both deserve more attention in any Rodgers biography, because the films of these plays (and &quot;The King and I&quot; and, of course &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;) are probably the most accessible Rodgers works available to the reader.  Nonetheless, this book does shed more light on Richard Rodgers the person than any volume I've read on him.  For as lengthy a book it is, you'd like to think the above areas received more attention.   Still, even though his works may not get quite as much attention, you'll learn more about Richard Rodgers the man in this book.  Perhaps a good complement to it would be Rodgers' biography &quot;Musical Stages&quot; and Hugh Fordin's biography of Oscar Hammerstein, &quot;Getting to Know Him.&quot;	2002-01-10

I love reading Doug Coupland's books, with their references to pop culture, their spiritual themes, and their amazing characters.  Two of those are present in this book, but the most important, the characters are very much lacking.  It is hard to embrace any of the major characters in this book, making it even more difficult to make your way through the novel.  Janet is the only character who is presented as being remotely likeable, but her sudden friendship with her ex-husband's new wife is unbelievable, despite the reason given as their connection. The character Wade is written as a loser, and he is just that.  The dad is not likeable, as we sift through page after page of Janet, Wade, or the other Drummond children talking about his lack of fathering skills, and his self-centeredness.  We throw in the brilliant kid, who was a child of Thalidomide and only has one hand, but her marriage is unhappy. Then there is Billy, who has attempted suicide many times, who is not particularly well-defined beyond that in the novel, and who is repeatedly put down by his siblings or his father.  Does any of this make you want to read the book?  Coupland is a supremely talented writer, and his novels are usually engaging reads.  However, both this novel and &quot;Miss Wyoming&quot; contain far too many characters who are hard to sympathize with or empathize with.  I really wanted to love this book.  It's unfortunate that I couldn't.	2001-12-30

People who were neither completely good, nor completely rotten. All this set in a world in which Richard Nixon was re-elected and the Constitution amended to allow him to continually seek and win re-election. And, the now requisite Armageddon, or near Armageddon. It was groundbreaking. But that was the mid-80s. This is 2001. Most of the themes in this book have been picked up and carried further by others,including the best graphic novel ever done, Ross/Waid's &quot;Kingdom Come.&quot;  This book is a good starting point and really should be used as what historians call a primary source, to get an understanding of the pop culture issues of the 1980s.

Why do so many people love Bill O'Reilly, while so many other people hate him?  Because Bill O'Reilly isn't shy about sharing his opinion of things.  If he thinks you're wrong, he'll spell out for you why he thinks you're wrong. But unlike so many, he'll actually listen to people who disagree with them and give them a chance to persuade him.   This book is a collection of interviews from &quot;The O'Reilly Factor,&quot; (the TV show, not the book), used to illustrate O'Reilly's points on subjects ranging from Hillary Clinton to NAMBLA.  Truthfully, the book would be a better read if there were more writing and less in terms of transcripts, but in all, this book demonstrates what's behind the O'Reilly phenomenon.  It seems to me people who are so insecure as to have their viewpoints challenged are those most likely to hate O'Reilly. But those who watch the show, will see that O'Reilly is neither a right-wing nor left-wing extremist. But those who are unable to see the world in any other way are those who make up his detractors.  Bill O'Reilly also goes after people who are full of it! If you're convinced your viewpoint on things is the only valid one, then you're not someone who will enjoy this book.  For you a blank journal in which you can indulge yourself with your thoughts may be a better buy.	2001-12-01

It's a class I took and enjoyed very much in the mid-1980s. Because this is a textbook, there are so many things happening that someone erroneously referred to as &quot;symbolism.&quot; The plot devices, as they're introduced in this science fiction novel, co-incide with what's being taught in the lecture hall.  That way, instead of students trying to grasp abstract ideas, they're presented for them in the context of this novel. As students hear about brainwashing techniques in the classroom, they read about it happening in this fictitious society. What's more, beyond the textbook itself (which reads a little like a Robert Ludlum take on the world of sci-fi), the story is enjoyable enough to keep the students' attention. In fact, if you never took the course, you'd probably enjoy this book as a sci-fi novel.  Also, the footnotes at the book's end tie into many of the recommended readings from the lectures.  If there were more textbooks written like this, there'd be more students pursuing higher education.  Long live Melia!	2001-11-28

However, his best work was written in the 1970s and early 1980s.  &quot;The Prometheus Deception&quot; really seems to be a re-tooled version of his 1980s book &quot;The Acquitaine Progression,&quot; in which a character jumps around from country to country, hooks up again with his estranged wife, and discovers there are few people he can trust. Had Ludlum decided to go off on a new writing strategy, his later works may have been as enjoyable as his first few. (&quot;The Osterman Weekend,&quot; for example, was a novel that not only kept you intrigued, it's final pages were alarming!)  Here it seems like he settled on a formula of concocting a character, inputting a number of cities on a map, throw in a few red herrings, and then come up with a finish that really seems to miss its impact (Same thing with the otherwise enjoyable &quot;Acquitaine Progression.)  Robert Ludlum should be remembered for a better book than this.	2001-11-25

Yet could a program based on little more than a handful of stereotypes be able to thrive on radio for more than 30 years?  This book answers that question by putting &quot;Amos 'n' Andy&quot; into perspective, through the evolution of the program, its roots in the minstrel shows, and its context within its own time.  Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, the white creators of the program, are portrayed quite fairly in this book, and their motives are also presented in a fair way.  Their goal was not to offend, though inevitably they did, but rather to entertain. This book shows how the core characters were portrayed in their own circle, the mythical Mystic Knights of the Sea lodge, and how they were portrayed beyond that inner circle, as the characters would intermingle with other blacks, and also whites.     Also worth reading is the efforts by the Pittsburgh Courier and a few other black newspapers to boycott the show as early as 1931.  More interesting, is how those attempts stalled, only to regain momentum 20 years later, with the advent of the television version.  The phenomenon of &quot;Amos 'n' Andy&quot; is more complex than it would seem, as it tells us more about American society and racial relations than perhaps any othe program ever. This book is not just about &quot;Amos 'n' Andy,&quot; but rather about ourselves. And for that, it should be a must-read.  I was able to finish this book in two days it was so engrossing.	2001-10-17

The fact that the key characters of this book happen to be Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Captain Marvel should not dissuade anyone from reading this or the equally compelling graphic novel by Waid and Ross.  That's because on the surface, this book is about superheroes (or meta-humans as they're called here), but in reality, this book is about us.  And as I was reading it, the message of this book took on added significance because of the events of September 11, 2001.  Indeed, there's an almost prophetic scene that takes place at Ellis Island.  But as you read the book, you understand the reason for Superman's banishment from society was not just a self-imposed exile.  We have cast aside the message of Superman in our times.  Now the fight for &quot;truth, justice and the American Way&quot; is either castigated, minimized, or prone to cynical interpretations of each word of the phrase.  But by rejecting this simple yet not simplistic philosophy, the world has, as we've seen, become a troubling place.  We've seen people do terrible things in the name of good causes, both in this book and in our own society.  They key line to this book belongs to Superman, who once he's coaxed to come out of exile and face this new troubling wave of &quot;meta-humans&quot;, tells the imprisoned new generation, &quot;In this world there is right and there is wrong. And that distinction is not hard to make.&quot;  Indeed, as events have shown, it is not.	2001-10-14

In the age of hypocrisy, defamation of character, finger-pointing, lying, manipulating, dirty tricks, and political warfare known as The Clinton Era, here is a book that tells it all.  But guess what, no one can call Joe Eszterhas a member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy. He's as far to the left as they come, and this book details exactly why those from the left should despise Bill Clinton and everything he stood for. There's a good reason why Richard Nixon's shadow pops up throughout this narrative. Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon are so similar that it's scary.  This book looks at the hope the Flower Children had in Bill Clinton when he was elected President, and then goes on to explain why he was the antithesis of what people like Eszterhas had hoped for in him.  Bill Clinton's Presidency, Eszterhas argues, wasn't about any great cause other than Bill Clinton.  But Eszterhas doesn't just go after Bill Clinton.  Hillary, Al, W., Dole, and others all get the same treatment here. Eszterhas hates hypocrisy and here he goes after it.  Unfortunately for America, there is a lot to go after.	2001-08-18

The problem with it, is like many articles that appear in &quot;Men's Health,&quot; this book is written to espouse certain beliefs the authors may have about weightlifting (they tell you to eat substantially less protein, for example, than you'll read in any other program), and in general, it's not quite clear that this book really is for anyone but the beginner.  If this helps someone get their butt off the couch and start lifting, fine. If you're anything but a beginner, you've probably read better articles in &quot;Muscle and Fitness&quot; or any other book that targets you.  &quot;Men's Health&quot; in general doesn't seem to really take into account the needs of the non-beginner, and that's a problem in all of their books. Still, there's no &quot;bad&quot; information here, per se.  In fact they're virtually endorsing what veteran lifters know as HIT (High Intensity Training), which is almost a shock based on the traditionally bland and unsophisticated approaches of the magazine.  This sounds like I'm trashing the book, but I'm really not.  If you're a 30-something who wants to get in shape, this is a good book for you.  If you've been lifting for more than a year, you'll probably find a lot of this pedestrian and uninspiring.	2001-08-18

It goes beyond the film somewhat and takes us up to the characters lives today.  Typical Stillman.  If you like Whit Stillman's films, this book is one you can carry with you at all times.  Some of the scenes from the Club don't translate very well to the book, but that's actually a plus, because the film is NOT about disco or the club per se. (Hence the bad reviews from people who mistakenly thought just because the film took place at a club, that it was  a ripoff of &quot;54&quot;.)  Those themes are methaphorical and the book helps bring everything into perspective. I probably wouldn't want to read the book without seeing the film first. And if you see the film, you also need to see &quot;Metropolitan&quot; and &quot;Barcelona,&quot; for it to all make sense.	2001-03-09

This series actually came out about a year after I stopped reading comic books as a teenager. When I saw it in this form, I couldn't resist picking it up. While the story has its moments, this is a book of excesses.  Virtually every character in the DC Universe ever manages to find his/her way into this story.  In each page, panels are squeezed in to give the book a &quot;busy&quot; look.  But the problem is, there are about 52 characters too many.  Basically, this was DC's way to change its comic universe because evidently too many people were confused by the idea that the characters who were from the 1940s continued on Earth 2, the Fawcett characters (Captain Marvel) lived on Earth S, and the modern day characters were living on Earth 1. Sound confusing?  It's not. But the desire to somehow streamline all of this into one universe and start some characters over from scratch led to this series.  Characters who get killed off aren't worth mourning. Supergirl is supposedly given her best storyline in decades.  Oh?  Guess Supergirl wasn't that interesting, then. The nice thing about comic books is all of this can be undone.  Hopefully someone will undo it all.	2001-02-24

The book's earlier chapters are particularly enlightening, adding a new perspective and appreciation for President Hoover, who actually did try to solve the Depression, but lacked the political skill to break away from his rigid thoughts of what government should do. I can't give the book five stars, however, because it gets bogged down in the World War Two chapters. The book is subtitled &quot;The American People in Depression and War,&quot; but it loses that focus on the average American for too many chapters. There are other engaging books on the military and political aspects of World War Two written over the last few years (the works of Ambrose, for example.)  Kennedy's finest chapters are those looking at the Homefront. More time should have been spent on that aspect as opposed to telling the story of planning for Overlord or Yalta.  Other books tell that story.	2001-02-16

These are the years that made Bing Crosby into a national sensation.  Those unfamiliar with Crosby's earlier work, may not quite realize what a significant figure he was in the evolution of popular music. Here was a white artist singing and legitimizing for a broader artist the songs, techniques, and feeling of black artists.  Though the book's first two chapters detailing the arrival of Crosby's ancestors to the country (really, does anyone want to read about this??) are of interest only to other biographers, the book as a whole soon starts sailing into the life of Bing Crosby. It's all here, the good, the bad, and the ugly.  While this volume doesn't yet get to the more difficult years described in Gary Crosby's book, the author's tone makes it clear he thinks Bing was a complex man.  He's quick to dismiss the more unsavory biographies of Crosby written in the wake of his death, and his evidence seems to indicate that perhaps Crosby has been the victim of hatchet jobs.   The book is also an outstanding chronicle of the Crosby records and films of this era, with very detailed recounts of the making of some of his most notable tracks and movies.  It ends with the filming and release of &quot;The Road to Singapore,&quot; and sets the stage for the next volume focusing on the Legendary Years.	2001-02-13

Then I got the book. They're right on the money.  I grew up reading the Superman of the 1970s. These are the stories that shaped my viewpoints of Superman, but this book is wanting.  None of the great Superman chronicles I remember are here. &quot;The Double or Nothing Life of Superman&quot; is a series I just purchased on eBay. It should be included in this volume. I also recall an outstanding, well-written series in which, among other things, the Bottled City of Kandor was smashed, as Superman again had issues with his Kryptonian past. And the greatest Superman story of the 1970s, &quot;Superman Vs. Spider-Man,&quot; while mentioned, is woefully missing.  The Superman of the 1970s brought about characters like Steve Lombard, Morgan Edge, and a few others, who participated in some great tales. You'll find the characters here, but not the good stories. Really, save your money on this book. Go to eBay and try and win some of the actual issues themselves from the 1970s.	2001-02-13

I don't think any serious certified personal trainer would back these ideas, or those put forward in \\"Static Contraction Training.\\" These methods encourage lifters to only exercise a certain part of the muscle during the range of motion. So.... the muscles may be getting stronger at a certain angle, but the remainder of the muscle is not getting adequate attention.  Minor problem?  No.  A guy who's done partials with 550 lbs on the bench press, may suddenly find how much weaker he is when he tries to go to a full range of motion, blowing out his rotator cuff in the process because it wasn't trained properly.<br />And using this formula requires far too much work on a calculator.  You can impress yourself by working up these numbers and coming up with how much you've been lifting over a certain period of time. But... would it ever occur to you that you could use the same formula for using regular reps?<br />Partial training can be an effective tool in weightlifting when used in conjunction with standard range of motion reps.  They can be a very good way of finishing a muscle part, because they can help the lifter target both the slow and fast-twitch muscles.<br />Also, why does Sisco quote himself in the book? Beware an author who has to quote himself when he's trying to make his case with you.<br />Following the advice in this book is like going from first to fifth gear in your car without going through gears two through four.	2001-01-12

Bill O'Reilly tells it like it is. He's tough on people, but he's fair.  His book reflects that. If you want a glossy, kissy-kissy Pollyana book, this isn't for you.

This book reads like you were sitting down next to him on the porch swing, and he's telling you his life story.  As such, there are a lot of inaccuracies. However, the stories are great to read and hear about.  You'll learn a lot about his music and life before Lucy. His days in Cuba are almost more interesting than his life on the road or in Hollywood. Surprisingly, it touches on &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; a little less than you'd think, and if you've read other books about the show, what is mentioned here will all sound familiar.  However, it is Desi's story in his own words.  And it's a book you can sit down and just while away the hours with.	2000-10-21

The problem is, they use a lot of technical anatomical terminology to explain the way muscles move and affect one another.  It's GOOD to know that, but the book's first few chapters come across as textbooks. Once you get beyond that, you'll find a very useful encyclopedia of exercises for various muscles along your legs and glutes.  If you're looking for exercises to work on these body areas, this book will serve you very well.  Just be patient in those first few chapters, it does become readable.	2000-10-05

Plus it has lots of nice photos of Superman toys and  merchandise over the years. (The only thing missing is Superman Spinball  Pinball, an amazingly fun toy that Mattell churned out to coincide with  Christopher Reeve's first Superman film.)

These are the stories prior to Clark Kent's move to television  and the creation of Morgan Edge.  As the preface to the book says, many of  the stories were told time and time again.  It's interesting to see a time  when comic books weren't always trying to be some dark statement. After  all, Metropolis isn't Gotham City.  This book helps you get a grasp of the  changes the Superman franchise went through in the 60s, with dozens of new  survivors of Krytpon, endless robots, an incredibly naive Jimmy Olsen, and  a not-yet-liberated Lois Lane.  Each story is &quot;safe.&quot; Nice to  look at, but if you're expecting anything of substance that you could,  perhaps, ponder, hopefully a &quot;Superman in the Seventies&quot; volume  will be coming out soon.  Here you will see Clark, Lois, Jimmy, Morgan,  Steve Lombard, and a less-important Perry White take on more human  characteristics. Until then, this book will give you lots of  super-simplistic stories that may or may not help you relive your youth.	2000-09-05

Good book, good plan, but if you're not careful you could find yourself suffering from overtraining.  Be sure to read carefully the information about diet and nutrition (which for some strange reason is at the end of  the book and not the front) so you can take in enough calories to support  the program.  I did this through at the &quot;journeyman&quot; level until  week 5 when I took the test and decided I was now at the &quot;master&quot;  level.   At that point, I was amazed to see that he's telling you to do  30-35 minutes of cardio after just spending between 90-minutes to two hours  lifting weights!  Not only is it very hard to find the time to do that, but  if you don't take in enough calories (quality, clean calories) you're going  to actually do more harm than good. I am pleased with what I've gotten out  of the book.  My only concern is the casual reader may not realize how  important (and how difficult) it is to consume in excess of 3500 calories a  day.   For the &quot;apprentice&quot; level, I'd say this is a very good  starting point. The plans provided change enough at that level and the fact  that the routine changes, and the fact that the routine is spelled out for  you should make this a must buy for someone starting out.   If you're at  the intermediate or advanced level, I'd still recommend this book.  Just be  careful.     Also, one other complaint. Some of the excercises in the  journeyman and master level aren't really described. You have to look  elsewhere or just figure them out.	2000-06-25

If this book were written today, you'd assume the author (a broadcast journalist) was referring to its not being so wild a dream to become a celebrity. The title  comes from &quot;On a Note of Triumph,&quot; the CBS broadcast marking V-E  Day: &quot;Post proves that brotherhood is not so wild a dream as those who  would benefit from its postponement would have us believe.&quot;   This  book follows Eric Sevareid's childhood, to his activism in college and the  belief that &quot;war is outdated&quot; or barbarism to his unflinching  belief in why fascism had to be defeated.  This is every bit a philosophy  book as it is a memoir and so eloquently explains how the changes brought  about by the defeat of fascism could bring together mankind, reaching from  Paris, France, to Sevareid's hometown of Velva. Shows Sevareid's mindset  and how important World War Two was in terms of defining a generation. When  you read this book, you understand why Tom Brokaw called his book &quot;The  Greatest Generation.&quot; Stop whatever you're doing and read this book!  You'll understand Sevareid, his generation, what America is supposed to be  about, why we fought the war and why brotherhood is not so wild a dream!  Buy this book!	2000-05-28

That being said, the author presents a good premise and makes his case very well, showing how Eisenhower's use of  public relations agencies, Robert Montgomery, and others helped the GOP and  the President in particular fare very well in the public's eye.  The  account of how the Presidential news conference was created (to avoid the  President's message from being &quot;interpreted&quot; by the reporters or  having the press neglect the message the White House wanted to get out) is  very informative and something viewers of modern day news conference should  keep in mind as well.

Like most textbooks, it tells you what it's going to say, goes into it in great  detail, and then sums it up.     The book is vital for any student of  Eisenhower, but also anyone who keeps an eye on current affairs. Details  how the Eisenhower Administration dealt with a myth put forward by  Congressional Democrats that the United States was falling behind the  Soviet Union in terms of military might. (See how some things never  change?) Explores how the White House came up with what remains our basic  defense policy today, namely reducing the size of traditional forces and  relying more on nuclear missiles, &quot;The New Look.&quot;  You'll see how  the Administration drafted this policy at the expense of things like  &quot;clean nuclear bombs,&quot; and so on.

It does recount his rise and fall and is worthwhile because it does include some good quotes from Sevareid's analytical pieces (he detested that they be considered commentaries) on \\"The CBS Evening News With Walter Cronkite.\\" Unfortunately, this book just seems to set up a wall between the author and its subject that is difficult to explain.

Unfortunately, when he wrote this book, many important things were still classified and he could not go into them.  Good starting point  if you're just getting interested in World War Two, but for much more  detail (perhaps too much detail), there's &quot;Eisenhower at War&quot; by  David Eisenhower. &quot;Eisenhower&quot; by Stephen Ambrose (Volume One and  NOT the abridged version combining Volumes One and Two) is also good.  Probably the most interesting book on Eisenhower during World War Two and  his entire life prior to the Presidency is Merle Miller's &quot;Ike the  Soldier.&quot; Each of these books delves into the same subject matter and  is able to do so without having key areas (like ULTRA) still kept  confidential.	2000-05-28

Thought has been replaced by good looks.  Read this book to see how CBS News became a news operation of mythic proportion  with brilliant, yet terribly troubled men creating such high standards that  have become forgotten. (You'll see no one on your local five pm television  news here.)  For these men, the importance was in writing, not pictures.  You'll also see how these legendary men were racked with insecurities and  self-torture.  It's also uncanny in terms of how each had a rise and fall  at CBS. Sadly, it's all true. The authors didn't need to resort to poetic  license. (Read other accounts of these figures and you'll learn that.) When  you're done with this book, you'll wish Howard K. Smith or Robert Trout  were still on television today.  You'll wish that instead of having happy  talk on the news, you had thoughful, intelligent people who respected their  audience doing reports that provoked the viewer's intellect and not pander  to him. Read how Howard K. Smith was fired from CBS, what prompted it way  back then, and realize the standards have been steadily declining since  then on all networks.

While the ending may not be as  powerful as that of &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma,&quot; or as poignantly  simple as &quot;Microserfs,&quot; &quot;Miss Wyoming&quot; does give the  reader the feel that he has accompanied these characters through their  soul-searching, and that it was an altogether satisfying journey  for John,  Susan, and the reader.
