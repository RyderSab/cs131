Firstly, let me deal with the quality of the book. Like all Bruno GMunder books this is printed on very high quality paper, in good rigid covers, and is quite sumptuous. Especially at this price!.    Then the boys! Where can one start? There must be a Johann Paulik of the future within these covers. The quality of the imagary, the poses, the lighting, the sets and the boys are quite, quite stupendous.    If you're after hairy muscle hunks this book will not be your cup of tea. If your taste is more towards the gym-toned (yet not over-developed) younger, smoother kind of man/boy, then you'll be in 7th heaven with this book.    The slightly hazy, misty kind of photography and the lighting bear a resemblance to the work of David Hamilton, albeit that he photographed young girls and women rather than boys and men. Nonetheless, I am struck by the slightly ethereal 'other-worldly' nature of Bel Ami's work.    Well worth adding to your collection.	2005-01-12
US	52893071	R2GLIX63HEZB6W	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	5	35	48	N	N	Thought-provoking, though the tree-huggers will hate it.	It's interesting to read other reviews which excoriate Chrichton for this, his newest novel. Most of the comments betray the Left-liberal bias of the writers and their refusal to even countenance that their preconceptions might be false. Predictably, they cling to their tree-hugging ideals and rather than argue against Mr Chrichton's position they seek to rubbish him by casting aspersions on his politics or even his sanity and intellectual abilities. Would that most of these critics had the intellect and intelligence to read those peer-reviewed papers that Chrichton cites freely. But then the 'flat-earthers' and opponents of 'evolution' found it hard to accept that those things they thought correct all their lives were, in fact, wrong. It takes a big man to admit that he's wrong. <br /> <br />Mr Chrichton has constructed a decent, well-researched (and more importantly properly cited) novel based on the premise that 'global warming' is at worst a myth and at best not as worrying as those with a vested interest in the concept would have us believe. The premise of the novel is that governments and their stooges like to keep the populations of their countries in a 'State of Fear' and thus easy to control and manipulate. In the case of the novel it's a rather scary bunch of deluded 'global warming' enthusiasts that set about to create a range of 'natural disasters' that will support their theories. <br /> <br />This long (600 page) book will challenge many of the reader's preconceptions, and for many younger people who've been brought up to believe that global warming is an established fact rather than a hypothesis, it might make the rail and scream - and then throw personal insults at the author. Better that they should look on-line or through their local library for the research papers that Chrichton cites. <br /> <br />Whether Mr Chrichton is right or wrong, it's only correct that any belief system or political orthodoxy should be challenged, be it global warming, diversity or multi-culturalism. Proponents of these ideas have to do more than assert that their ideas are correct, they need to prove them, and they need to do it without rubbishing the integrity of their opponents. But then as Mr Chrichton writes, many environmentalists are long on attitude and short on facts. All they have left is the ability to rubbish anyone who doesn't swallow their argument. This tactic was very well demonstrated by the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. <br /> <br />In all, this was a thought-provoking and interesting read.	2005-01-09

Too often, when modern schoolchildren consider WW2, they see the parades of elderly veterans, stooped, wrinkled, bemedaled, but essentally OLD. <br /> <br />What the compiler of this book has managed to do is to collect a wide range of photo material, much of it of very high quality, which shows the young men who fought WW2 as they were then. That is, as young men. Slim, upright, happy, fit. Often little more than schoolboys themselves. In that regard, this book is reminiscent of Herbert List's book \\"Junge Manner\\".  <br /> <br />I was so impressed with my book that I've ordered a second copy to be put into the library of the secondary school at which I'm a  governor. WW2 seems to be popular in history lessons. Let the children of today see the youths of yesteday as they were at their prime.	2004-10-08

I found that this story was better than previous Ablow books that I have  read. The plot is complex and devious and, as in all good thrillers, the story is not resolved until the last few pages. <br /> <br />However, a niggling point is the lack of attention to English grammar that cropped up in the book in a few places. No doubt Dr Ablow would label me as 'anal' in my need for accuracy, but I despair that a well-educated author, much less a well-trained editing and proof-reading team would approve of the following. <br /> <br />On a number of occasions we are treated to the very childish use of the very wrong following contraction: \\"should have\\" is contracted to \\"should of\\" when it should, of course be \\"should've\\". On other occasions \\"must've\\" is relaced with \\"must of\\", and so on. I don't know about American teachers, but it drives English teachers of language mental when they read this sort of sloppiness. <br /> <br />It's an insult to your readers, Dr Ablow, so I docked you a star from my rating.	2004-09-07

I admit that I have struggled with Kathy Reichs in the past. I know others have rated her highly and compared her to Patricia Cornwell, but I failed to see any comparison.<BR>Reichs' failings, I felt, lay in her plotting and dialogue. Her characters always seemed very one-dimensional and uninviting, even though she had come up with some promising storylines. Reichs' previous efforts have, to me at least, been very artificial and amateur, clunky and awkward.<br />However, with Monday Mourning Reichs has transformed herself. Her characters suddenly have depth and believability; better, their dialogue has become life-like as the author has discovered (or uncovered) her ability to write funny, sardonic, sarcastic and sometimes ironic lines for her characters to deliver. Suddenly, I found that I laughed out loud at odd points when reading. Not real belly laughs as you get with Tom Sharrpe, but nonetheless some very witty moments to be enjoyed.<br />The plot is good. It is almost beleivable (I'm still not totally convinced about forensic anthropologists being called in so early in investigations) and we can see why the heroine, Brennan, has been involved. We see her struggle with the sheer evil that confronts her in this book. Indeed, the evil that is the main story in the book will take your breath away when it's uncovered.<br />So, all in all, a much improved writer showing some real skill at last.	2004-07-15

Does this book ever recapture those seemingly inncocent days of the 60s and early 70s?<br />Some wonderful models, wonderful locations and most of all a wonderfully bright and sunny California sky. Most of the photos have a warmth of light that simply glows from the page..<br />This book is like the Beach Boys but in photographs and not songs. The images convey a simple innocence and enjoyment. The haircuts and clothing takes you back to those easier, less frenetic times.<br />The poses range from the very formal style of the 1950s, to the informal 'snapshot' from 1979. The models are, for the most part, not the hulks seen in so many American physique photos, but rather more evryday types of guys. The emphasis is on the young, and if you have a hunkering for the blond surfer type, you won't be disappointed.<br />Well worth buying.	2003-07-11

The set of plots that converge only towards the end of ths book are gripping in and of themselves. Gulvin's ability to bring them together demonstrates great forward planning.<br />As one other reviewer has noted, it is a tad tiresome to switch from one sub-plot to another, but press on. It's worth all the effort.<br />It's also worth reading Gulvin's other books, which feature the same main characters and you are able to see the development of their relationships, and also the sheer breadth of the author's vision for his plots.	2002-11-18

Kris, one of the Three from Roffman's collection of pictures of the same name, matures from a rather shy youth to a confident young man, whose clear gaze and natural eroticism have already bewitched many an observer.    His previous book of Johan Paulik was slightly better than this, perhaps because it contained solo photographs but nonetheless, Pictures of Kris is a worthy addition to your coffee table or bookshelf.

To use an analogy with cars, most writers give us VW Beetles; they are adequate, do the job, the finish is OK, they get you to the journey's end. Kellerman, however, has the ability to give us a Roll-Royce of thrillers; his books are well-written, fast, comfortable, exceedingly well-detailed, and we get to the end of the journey wishing we still had miles to go!<br />This latest book is a fine example of Kellerman at his best. Other reviewers have precis-ed the plot, so I want to just comment of the fluent writing style that Kellerman possesses. His characters are well-drawn, three dimensional and fleshed-out. When a character is introduced the descriptions enable every reader to create him/her in his mind's eye, filling out the stage of imagination wonderfully. Even the principals are added-to. We learn more about the Delaware character, more about Milo the scruffy gay detective, and for those of us that don't live there more about the geography of the LA area.<br />A first rate read. A first rate thriller. A first rate author.	2001-12-19

My 'better-half' as he likes to call himself told me that I'd only bought this book to stare at and lust over the extremely gorgeous blond boy on the cover. How shallow does he think I am? After all, I carefully studied the dark-haired guy as well, before I dismissed him in favour of the dishy blond.    Two kinds of people are going to be very disappointed by this novel; those who expect it to be a tale of true raunch featuring those oh-so-pretty cover guys; and those who ere expecting a gut-rippingly funny story.    In truth, this book is neither, although it is very witty, employing a sardonic tone and it is about a rent-boy agency. What the author, Kenry, does do is to give the reader a half-plausible plotline to explain how a spoiled brat, whose sugar-daddy dies, ends up starting his own business as a \\"Escort Agency\\". There is an extremely well-made moral in the first chapter which transcends humour (and nationality) and does make it clear that in jurisdictions based on English Common Law, you MUST make a Will in favour of your partner to avoid the poor chap having to sell his body!    I read this book just after I'd read Aaron Lawrence's book about how to become a cyberhustler, and I thought that great chunks had been lifted right out. So, Kenry got his research right <g>, and I hope he got tested after doing it!    This really is a very amusing book that makes a few serious points along the way and will, I'm sure, make many guys very happy.	2001-12-19

This book has a few shortcomings; it's a little light on flesh, and some of the plot structures are little simplified. However, what this book does deliver in spades is the pilot's eye view of war, not from the cockpit, but from his own throughts. We get a glimpse into the mind of junior officers, the fears of naval flying (many, I know from my own experience), the management styles that work and those that don't. All this is tied into an exciting story that requires just a little more input from the reader than most books. That input is well rewarded.	2001-12-19

He escapes jail, leaving dead guards in his wake, and we follow his rampage through the Midwest of the USA, corpses left scattered everywhere, as ghe authorities bring Jonny's military colleague Dale Miller to assist the police efforts to recapture the convict.<br />The book weaves its compelling tale around the friendship that was enjoyed by Dale and Jonny, by Dale's intimate knowledge of Jonny's methods, and and throws in the detruction of more policemen than exist in many small towns, a few criminals, a few houses and cars.<br />This book would be the ideal basis for a film to beat Lethal Weapon.

This story of Serb soldiers allegedly being brutally executed by an American SpecFor away team was quite a hook. Being presented with the &quot;evidence&quot; by the Serb News Media, the US top-brass send Army lawyer Sean Drummond and his team to investigate the truth of the matter. The tale is told using Drummond's cynical and sarcastic voice which whilst initially witty becomes grating. The cast of characters seems well-rounded and plausible, but for Spec7 Imelda Pepperfield; if I'd come across someone like her in MY military career, she'd have been on a charge of insubordination immediately!<br />I can't comment on the accuracy of the JAG investigation or whether lawyers would actually DO the investigation rather than line officer's and military police investigators. However, the story does drive on at a fast pace to a satisfying conclusion and the book is exciting. For that alone, it's worth the purchase.<br />My reservations lie in language accuracy, some spelling errors. If the author is prepared to allow these to creep into his book, how accurate are the details on which a book like this hangs? Fow example, Haig invents a neologism,namely &quot;conspirational&quot;. What does that mean? We also are faced with the absurd picture of a man having a single thick eyebrow which is PERPENDICULAR to his moustache. That would be a sight! Of course, Haig meant to say parallel.<br />Despite these problems the book was an enjoyable romp.	2001-12-17

This large-format book contains photos of young men taken from the 1920s through to the 1950s.  They are amazingly fresh and vibrant, sexy, modern yet classical, and show this great photographer's vision and love of the male form. The models are for the most part aged between 18-25.<br />It's amazing to think that even some of the oldest of these images are so fresh that they may have come from the 1980s. Sometimes the clothing (of which there is little) shows the period in which the pictures were made but most of them have a tingling vibrancy and liveliness that belies their age. It's odd to think that the beautiful naked youth from the 1920s is probably no longer alive, yet his beauty and grace have, by List's skill, transcended time and we get the chance to wonder about how he lived; what he made of his life; and to ponder on how youthful beauty, though transient, can last forever.<br />This book is a truly wonderful addition to the bookshelf of any connoiseur of both early photography and male beauty.	2001-12-13

There are a number of plots running together and tied to each other in a reasonably satisfying manner. This structure ensures that the book retains its interest throughout. The pace is relentless and driving; the sort of book that is truly difficult to put down. The principal caharcter, LtCdr Alan Craik is the sort of hero that is common in cartoons; he never fails, never tires, and always wins in the end. Despite this 'Boy's Own Story' approach, the character works. He is surrounded by his friends and supporters, even to a crusty old admiral who watches on with indulgent pride as Craik scores yet another win for the US Navy. There is a lot of accurate detail in respect to naval aviation and carrier operations.<br />On the downside, I felt a growing sens of &quot;deja vu&quot; as plot-line after plot-line was introduced. This book, it seems to me, is not original and borrows some of its themes from other areas, either books or film. I can't quite place it, but I've seen it before.<br />Additionally, there were 31 spelling errors; all of these were in the form of letter transposition that enabled a spell-checker to pass over the faults. For example, &quot;chanced&quot; was altered to &quot;changed&quot; and completely destroyed the meaning of the sentence and it is only by context that one is able to insert the correct word. I also counted 11 sentences where there were key words omitted altogether. This lack of accuracy matters, not just by way of maintaining decent English, but crucially because books that rely heavily on accurate detail fail if you begin to suspect that lack of rigour has been allowed to prevail. It was notable that more than half of the errors occurred in last third of the book.	2001-11-28

Lewis Wolpert is one of Britain's leading scientists. In particular, he is a world-class developmental biologist. His other great love and drive is to make science accessible to 'ordinary' people. This book was written to accompany a six-part TV series run on BBC TV - the first time that depression has been given so much air-time.    He brings his incisive mind to bear on the subject of depression, and describes how this truly devastating and dreadful illness slid his own legs from under him when he was stricken. He goes on to explore the symptoms and the various treatments. Interestingly, he does not cast aspersions on psychological treatments in favour of biological variants. In fact, he is astute enough to recognise that many of the 'softer' treatment modalities can affect brain chemistry through behavioural modification. Through his great desire to pass on much of what he uncovered, he distilled the information into this book which accompanied a six part TV series produced ny the BBC.    This is NOT a morbid book. It's aim is to enlighten the sufferer (and his carer) and perhaps point them in the direction of alternative options if their recovery isn't progressing well. It is also NOT a self-help book, in as far as Wolpert doesn't tell you how to treat yourself.    A great book and a great TV series.	2001-11-22

This tome, and the UK edition has some 450 pages PLUS a very extensive bibliography, is a worthy addition to the literature on depression. Solomon manages to use wit to explain the hopelessness that sufferers feel, how and why treatments may or may not work, but most of all that it is worth the struggle to carry on until a solution is found.<br />As an academic (as well as a psychologist) I was particularly struck by the chapter notes and very extensive bibliography, and these will surely be enough to point most readers to more in-depth articles, papers and books should they wish to delve.<br />The book is a great read for those who live with (just!) people with depression, as well as their wider families, friends and carers. It's not a substitute for professional help.  One slight downside in a 'resource for sufferers' is that most people who have marked depression also have very marked lack of concentration, which might make this lively but weighty book unaccessible.	2001-11-22

How does Roffman manage to capture so much of his subject's soul in his photographs? That he does so capture it is eveident in this wonderfully rich collection of B&amp;W images.<br />There are a combination of formally posed and more naturally posed photos, and all seem to connect the reader to the model's core. I feel that B&amp;W is the best medium to capture this aspect of erotic photography as you are not distracted by colour.<br />Fred, a French gymnast and model, is beautiful. He seems at times both carefree and self-aware. Roffman captures the spark of youth.<br />You really MUST buy this book; you'lle be pleased that you did.	2001-11-09

His early style still captures the beauty, poignancy, and fun of the three young men he photographs for this book.<br />There is some explanatory text but this is just a tad saccharine in it's sentimentality.  The photographs are stunning, and that is what is truly important, so you can afford to ignore the text if you wish. He's even made some of the grins seem enticing. The more thoughtful photographs are truly erotic.<br />This is not a wank mag - it's softback and the spine isn't too strong, even if your's is. It is, however, a strongly recommended example of young men at one with each other ad the photographer.	2001-11-09

If you did not get on with Hawking's last great popular opus (A Brief History of Time) because you found it obscure, then you'll feel totally out of your depth with this tome.    One gets the feeling that Hawkin doesn't know who he's writing for, and so he tries to simplify but still includes so much jargon that the meaning of the text remains obscure.    There are some really great diagrams included with the text, presumably to illustrate the meaning of complex themes that Hawking is trying to explore. Regrettably, the diagrams don't help much; were they even at the right point of the book?    One is led to suspect that Hawking is trying to gain another huge selling book to garner further income for his family before he dies. The shame of this lies in the fact that he is undoubtedly well-versed and respected in his field but he forgets that the average man in the street may only have two or three years of secondary school physics or maths education. Thus, they are functionally illiterate in Hawking's field, and I fear that he aimed the book too high.	2001-11-07

This book tackles a subject that is truly vital in the Western world today. Men (and boys) have effectively been emasculated as a result of the liberal-left espousement of the feminist principle. There is no reason that females should not enjoy all that modern society can offer (provided they earn that enjoyment), but this must not be done at the expense and over the crushed spines and pride of young men and boys.<br />I was troubled with some of this author's suggestions for rectifying the difficulties that boys face today, mainly because he espouses a very 'Christian' or 'biblican' approach to family management. I am not a Christian, indeed I strongly feel that organised religion of ANY sort causes a huge lack of mental agility and respect for others - just look at the actions of fundamentalist Christians (the Crusades), Jews (Israel today), and Muslims (Israel and elsewhere).<br />The essential anaysis is sound, however. What the feminist and liberal coalition don't want to accept is that girls and boys are DIFFERENT. It's obvious, I know. They look different (anatomically) and most of all they THINK differently. It's become well-established over recent years that gender dimorphism of the brain is a real thing. The male and female brains are specialised to perform different tasks, albeit with a large degree of overlap. How many boys/men do you know who have to trun a road atlas upside-down to figure out which way they're going? The male brain is better adapted to abstract visuo-spatial analysis - that also explains why women are generally worse car parkers than men.<br />As the brains are different, so the ways of learning are different. The recent drop in relative scolastic performance is based on a number of things, but the drive since the '70s to put resources behind girls has not helped. Similarly, the growing demand from women that men are 'not necessary' and the rise in the number of one-parent families is a problem now coing home to roost.<br />There is apreponderance of females in the kindergarten/infant/junior school area. Indeed, the first time many children see a male teacher is when the reach secondary level education! How useful to socity is that? If there is no father-figure at home, and no male teachers, the boy gets no real role model to learn from. To that extent, Cub Scouts and other organisations are really useful. However, the haridans of the raving left have driven men out of all areas of contact with children by saying it isn't normal for men to enjoy or like young children. Thye raise the ugly spectre of sex abuse, and thus scare off many men from these vital roles.<br />In Britain, the Government are wringing their hands over the poor outcomes for many boys. The answers are clear - a return to 'normal' family structures WOULD help, although perhaps not as rigidly as the author would like.<br />This book is certianly worth reading. I would suggest that you try to read it in conjunction with a decent book describing gender dimorphism (my recommendation isn't available through Amazon) along with a book describing gender differentiation in learning methodologies.<br />The answers from the book are clear, and I accept them:<br />Better family structures,<br />More men in positive role models<br />If divorce is inevitible, maintain links between father and son.<br />Avoid lone parenting if possible.<br />More male teachers.<br />Stop trying to deny a boy his birthright - he is NOT a girl, so stop trying to make him into one.<br />Kick the feminists out of positions of authority - they've gone too far.<br />A job is important - welfare payments are no substitute.<br />Strong, but fair, discipline is needed	2001-11-03

It is approximately 12&quot; square, like a vinyl LP record, and comes in a tough card outer sleeve or box, thus keeping the actual book itself free from damage. I don't know exactly how much it weighs, but I suspect that it must be 3-4 Kg, so if you order it warn your postman! The images are all B&amp;W.<br />It is also large in terms of content, there being some 600-odd images presented. There is an intoxicating range of photographs spreading over many years of Mapplethorpe's work and many genres. I have always found his flower portraits the most inspiring and they are here in plenty although regrettably none in colour. Obviously there also the formal portraits, the pictures of large male genitalia, pictures of Patti Smith (who is she, anyway?), a large number of self portraits, and many others.<br />This is NOT a book of sex images although there are few that are 'close to the mark', rather a collection of more of Mapplethorpe's more artistic ventures. Of all, I was much struck by the simple (polaroid) image of a young man on page 25, simple called &quot;Untitled, 1974&quot;.<br />There is a superb essay by Arthur C. Danto explaining much of the controversy surrounding this photographer, along with a very full catalogue of Mapplethorpe's work, his books, exhibitions, and a bibliography of those who have written about or included his works.<br />Very good value for money if you are a fan.	2001-10-22

This book is large format (12&quot; square) and comes supplied with a strong card case which protects the book and dust jacket from damage.<br />The photographs themselves are extremely well presented, many in colour or with colour surrounds or mounts. The range moves from formal portraits to some sex images to self-portraits to flowers and a couple of excellent still-life pieces. The book is simply sumptuous in its feel.<br />Most of this work is definitely towards the 'art' end of this photographer's spectrum. There is a very useful list of plates at the rear of the book with full details of the date, subject, photograph size, etc.<br />There is also a rather meandering essay by Edmund White which can safely be ignored or, if you enjoy pompous and meaningless written drivel, enjoyed depending on yourself.<br />A superb addition to the bookshelf of any Mapplethorpe fan, or indeed any lover of art photography.	2001-10-22

The sex pictures are quite grotesque, concentrating as they do on the pain, blood, urine, bondage and so on. Whether you'll enjoy these depends on your view of the subject. Personally, I didn't find them uplifting or illuminating. The models were sullen, looked unhappy, or downright sad: but then I suppose if your... has been nailed to a plank you're entitled to be a little shaken!<br />The few portraits included in this volume were entirely unpleasing, and not representative of Mapplethorpe's better work. They offered no real insight ot the subjects, who remained cold and aloof, detached it seems from the process of making art.<br />This is a collection of many of Mapplethorpe's more 'sensational' and 'shocking' images. Whether you are affronted or not they do deserve inspection, if only to see what the 'conservatives' tried to ban. You might actually feel repulsed and agree that these pictures are not art but pornography.	2001-10-22

His models are simply magical (well all but one!), and their sensitivity, shyness and youth simply flood from the page to your eye and then to your brain.<br />I suspect that many guys will simply absorb themselves in the pictures and wish they could dive in and hug many of these boys - and boys most of them are. No hardened, pumped-up, muscle-Marys here; simply a collection of great boy-next-door types.<br />Tha accompanying text gives context to the models and the photographs; Roffman says that he loves Brian, the first profile portrait we see. Well, so do I! He just too perfect and is, for me, the very best of what is a superb collection of pretty boys.<br />Highly recommended for its soul, its insight, its quality, and for its presentation of first-class eye candy.	2001-10-22

Whilst I do not particularly find this type of physique to be erotically charged, I can certainnly report that these pictures will stimulate many people who are in love with portrayals of the modern nude male. Messana seems to be able to get his camera inside the models' heads and bring out some real feeling and emotion, one of which is surely joy.<br />So buy it, it's not expensive and is a great addition to any collection.	2001-10-21

This book excels itself, both as an excellent example of photographs of an extremely sexy model and also as an example of the quality of these Editon Euros imprints.<br />I imagine that most guys will have seen Johan at some time, principally in the Bel Ami videos which are themselves outstanding. Most of the images are of Johan, although there are some of him with other Bel Ami boys. How they find these beauties is a mystery. As always, Johan just exudes &quot;sex&quot; from every page. He and the others seem to truly enjoy their modelling and that sense is captured in every photograph.<br />I would draw your attention to Howard Roffman's book of photos entitled &quot;Johan&quot;, which let us glimpse this 'wunderkind' some years later in his life, and you can see his body becoming slightly more rounded and adult - much more sexy in my view.<br />There is almost a &quot;Hamilton-esque&quot; style to many of these pictures - not in the poses, but in the feel, the lighting etc. They could almost be 'misty'.<br />Despite the colour (I prefer B&amp;W) this book makes a welcome entry onto my bookshelves.	2001-10-21

Another reviewer has described this book as sumptuous, and he's right.<br />All of these models appear in a range of images, mostly nude, but some clothed. The clothed pictures are still incredibly sexy. There are some couples and a few groups. Each model is introduced by name so you can keep track, or search the Bel Ami videos for your favourite; don't forget, though, that this is 'the book of the film', so you can hunt the Amazon sites for the video/DVD.<br />It's difficult to express the sheer joy that shines fron each page. These guys really are happy, and it shows. The photographer has managed to put a catchlight in every eye, and they truly sparkle. There is a cheeky sense of the child in each of the models; a sense of freedom, willingness to share (you wish!!), and exuberance.<br />Buy this book. You will NOT be disappointed (unless you only like to look at muscle freaks),	2001-10-21

So, I tried again; and, yes, I failed again.<br />I knew from the Kirkus review that this was not the usual accomplished Scarpetta novel, but I was prepared to give it a go. I found the plot(?) ludicrous, the characters so flimsy that they didn't last the length of the novel and ... Well, I guess you can say that one of my favourite authors let me down.<br />The writing was difficult to follow at times and the story seemed to lurch from scene to scene. Often, when an author tries to capture dialect you can see failure laid before you on the page (the most notable for me is Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte), and Cornwell's attempt to capture the inbred, closed dialect of the inhabitants of Tangier Island left me bemused, not amused.<br />That being said, there were a patches of truly well observed behaviour that presented true farce: regrettably they were too few.	2001-10-20

A brilliant story, well plotted and written	I found this book to be immensely well-written, with plausible characters (if implausible names), a plausible story-line, and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm a great fan of murder mysteries and this book is as good as the best of its type. It isn't a 'police procedural' however, like so many recent muder novels. It's more a delving into the minds of a very closed community, an examination of motives, desires, and personas.<br />It is, in fact, very &quot;Agatha Christie&quot;.<br />Well worth reading.	2001-10-19
US	52893071	R11JTI3VCKYZ5E	1555834248	407099027	Now & Then	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Moving, evocative and memorable story.	There's no point in revealing the plot of this deeply moving novel; suffice it so say that the story revolves around unrequited adolescent love, loneliness, becoming accustomed to one's empty life, and finally a touching renewal of a link made many years earlier.<br />This novel begins in a small English public school (a boarding school) where the principal character becomes aware of his own burgeoning sexuality, that of those around him, and the difficulty of expressing those feelings in a meaningful way. After a highly inflamed relationship in which our hero falls deeply in love with another boy, only to be discarded, we move to a later period in his life where he is lonely and seemingly has only his ... girlfriend for company.<br />However, events unfold which bring characters from the past rushing back into his life and the story moves to a great climax (no pun intended) as he is reunited with the most unexpected of his schoolchums.<br />This story benefits from a deep understanding of middle-class English life of the late 50's and early 60's, when the emotions will be very clear to the reader. Certainly, as someone who is currently 47 years old, who attended a public school (albeit much better one) and whose parents were decidedly middle-class I can feel myself stronly drawn to the boys in the school; indeed it was like travelling back in time. Subsequent elements of the story rang loud bells in my mind as I recognised the  girlfriend (I've never had one, but friends have), and the flowering of late-love with men met years previously.<br />This is a very moving novel, well-written, and extremely well observed. It should be on everyone's bookshelf.	2001-10-17

Many people have seen Johan Paulik in the bel AMi sex-action films, and have lusted after this beautiful and almost real youth. Hoffman has managed to capture all of Johan's appeal in this masterful collection of B&amp;W images. From the outdoor shots to the casual indoor poses, these pictures ooze charm, sex-appeal, and wit.<br />The comments by Paulik (in the foreword) that he feels that he is not as attractive at 25 as he was at 18 frankly cause wonder. has he looked Roffman's pictures? Can he be so unconfident about his body? Surely, he is more rounded than he was at 18. Who isn't? That being said, his 'rounded' form makes him all the more attainable, as he looks even more like the boy-next-door, even if he is much more beautiful. I for one find him much more erotic and sexy than when he was 18! I showed this book to a friend of mine, a married woman, who looked through the images, paused for breath and then said, &quot;What an outstandingly beautiful man!&quot; That says it all.<br />A great book.	2001-10-09

This collection is composed of high-quality images, well produced and well presented. The paper is high quality and the binding good. It is a good coffee-table book that won't offend many people.<br />The bad parts are legion, and I'm grateful that I was baought this book as a gift. I would have felt cheated if I'd bought it myself. Why? Well, firstly there are too many images of black men. This may be fine if you like oil-smeared, shiny black muscles but not if, like me, you are not a great admirer of photograhps of black men. This may not be the &quot;PC&quot; thing to say, but coming from England I'm not, thankfully, gagged by this most objectionable of American crazes. (It's an interesting thought that one is able to make all sorts of negative comments about pretty-boys or muscle-hunks, but say a negative word about black models and the wishy-wahsy liberals get their hair in a tizz).<br />Secondly, the poses are formulaic. They're stiff, uninteresting, mostly body-shots. There is little eye-contact with the models, and if there is they look totally bored by the whole process. How is it that Mapplethorpe managed to get so much more from these sort of poses?<br />None of the models even dares to smile - not even a small wry smile. As a viewer I'm totally uninvoled with the book. I'm not invited in to free my erotic imagination. I received this book at the same time I got Hoffman's book of pictures of Johan Paulik, and that book is the other side of the coin. I would happily leave this book out on the coffee table in the hope that someone would ask to borrow it and fail to return it. I would chain the book of Paulik photographs to the floor to stop it leaving the house.	2001-10-09

This is an interesting if slightly perplexing collection of photographs. I guess that the authors aim to present images of young boys making the difficult transition to young adulthood has been shown, but with a non-cohesive sense of place. The presentation of young Indian boys towards the centre of the book comes in sharp contarts to the images of West German boys elsewhere. Indeed, I felt they were out of place and opportunistically placed. Almost as if the author suddenly found this odd set of pictures he'd taken years ago and thought \\"I could use some of those here\\".<br />The collection ranges from candid photgraphs to rigidly posed studies, some of the latter being amongst the most haunting I've ever seen. There truly can be beauty in the peri-pubescent and adolescent male. I know some people have claimed that this book has been produced to satisfy that strange group of people who call themselves \\"boy-lovers\\", and it may indeed appeal to such people. However, lovers of the male form more generally can gain from viewing this collection, and trying to understand the context in which the photographs were taken.  ....	2001-10-09

What an angel! What a body! What a face! The ultimate boy next door! I felt ambivalent about the tattoos and piercings, but I guess we all have our kinks. I adored those pictures of Brian when he wasn't smiling, just looking slightly contemplative and wistful. The most amazing thing for me to see (or not see, depending on your point of view) is that Brian is unabashedly normally endowed. So often models seem to be chosen for their improbably long dongs or overly developed muscles. Brian is the kid you always lusted after in the showers after games at school; or the guy you meet at the gym; or even the boy next door. This is a book I will look at again and again. Well worth the purchase cost.	2001-08-27

Once more we encounter the embittered detective Harry Bosch being given the impossible case to solve.<br />As in previous stories, the author writes plausible plots and believable narrative in a flowing prose style.<br />The  outcome will surprise many readers, and yet at the same time will be  chillingly familiar to readers of previous Bosch novels. Is Bosch really  the winner? Does the LAPD come out of this looking bright and shiny? Or is  it, once more, a triumph for the political sleaze-balls operating in the  background?<br />Make up your own mind! I read this book in one (long)  sitting, and found it entirely gripping and oh-so-believable.<br />From the  perspective of an English reader, the political milieu in which Bosch  operates seems almost impossible - but then we don't have huge numbers of  guns running around our streets, either in criminal or legal hands.  Connelly manages the seemingly impossible of merging hugely entertaining  thriller with a sharp, precise and deeply insightful look at the  sociological and political institutions of the city in which he  lives.<br />Another winner!	1999-01-22

I read this book with a growing sense of dread.<br />I deal professionally as a psychologist with adults trying to come to terms with childhood sexual abuse and abandonment, and in this book we encounter both.<br />The first,  abandonment, happens to many children, in this case evacuation because of  war, in many cases because of being sent to boarding school. The author  captures only to vividly the sense of isolation, distress and loneliness  that such a situation can bring to a sensitive child.<br />The second is the  sexual abuse. The casual, uncaring, almost dismissive, abuse by the soldier  leaves the boy with guilt and shame, and obviously great confusion.<br />It  was a book that was hard to rate: The translation into first-class  idiomatic English was just that; First Class, and the translator deserves a  special mention.  <br />Clearly, that means that the original Dutch book was  also written with heartbreaking sensitivity. The one thing that was missing  from this story was love bewtween the sexual protagonists; instead we read  of exploitation and gratification of the adult's desires. The only love  that seems to exist comes from 'Mem', the mother of the home to which  Jeroen is evacuated, and from the boy's own parents.<br />Having seen the film  allegedly based on this book, I'm at a loss to divine whence the  scriptwiter's story came from. Did he read a different book to me?	1999-01-09

This book, which I first read in 1969, and found in an ordinary bookshop(!) must surely be due for a reprint, now that we live in more tolerant times.<br />It is a gentle, romantic, sensitive and realistic  portrayal of first love and the dilemmas facing the teachers or pubescent  boys, growing aware of their sexual power.<br />A wonderful read.	1998-12-10
