However the book, told from the point of view of the young Mary Russell, is totally captivating. I have fallen in love with this odd couple team of detectives. The author, Laurie King, does a wonderful job of showing the developing relationship between these two brilliant people separated by a generation and gender, and at the same time tells a great detective story. I look forward to more books in this series.	2005-10-10

The author, Thomas Misa, is a professor in the Department of Humanities at the  Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. He looks at the relationship between technology and the various cultures of these periods and shows that \\"technology is not only a force for but also a product of social and cultural change.\\"<br /><br />In the first chapter, \\"Technologies of the Court,\\" he looks at the court engineers, including Leonardo da Vinci, the invention of perspective in painting, and the Gutenberg printing press to show how these technologies were used, not for economic gain, but to support the royal courts and city-states of the Renaissance era.<br /><br />The second chapter is entitled \\"Techniques of Commerce\\" and looks at the period from 1588 to 1740 when Dutch merchants amassed fortunes using technologies like herring fishing boat factories, windmills, and fine textiles manufacture and developed an international trade second to none. They used their wealth to support fine artists and to speculate in tulip bulbs.<br /><br />\\"Geographies of Industry\\" is the third chapter and it covers the period from 1740 to 1851, the time of the Industrial Revolution in England. Rather than looking at the cities normally considered  the homes of industry in this period, Misa takes a close look at industry in London, using beer brewing as his focus. He then compares London to Manchester's textiles industry and Sheffield steel manufacture. He does this to create a much more complex image of the Industrial Revolution, and to show that there were many paths to industrialization in the period.<br /><br />1840 to 1914 is the subject of \\"Instruments of Empire,\\" the fourth chapter. Here Misa looks at how British Imperialism and the technologies of railroads, steamships, and telegraphy interacted to create a world-spanning empire.<br /><br />Chapter five, Science and Systems, covers a second industrial revolution that took place between 1870 and 1930. Here the German science-based chemical industry developed a synthetic-chemical empire based originally on fabric dyes. Also science and technological research became an integral part of industry, driving out the independent inventors of earlier times. The author also looks to America's electric lighting struggle between direct and alternating current systems. Out of these developments  came modern German companies like IG Farben, BASF, Bayer, and AGFA, as well as the American firms of Westinghouse and General Electric. Misa also looks at the beginning of university industrial partnerships with the development of the MIT labs.<br /><br />The first half of the 20th century is the focus of chapter six, \\"Materials of Modernism.\\" Here the Italian Futurists, the German Bauhaus, and the Dutch Modernists take the modern materials of steel and glass to redefine architecture and aesthetic theories.<br /><br />\\"The Means of Destruction,\\" chapter seven, looks at the relationship between the military and technological innovation in the 20th century. Misa calls World War II a \\"war of innovation\\" and looks closely at the atomic programs on both sides of the war as an example of how this relationship developed. The author shows that after the war this military-technology relationship still held sway. He uses the examples of the development of solid-state electronics and digital computers to illustrate this.<br /><br />In chapter 8, \\"Toward a Global Culture,\\" the author shows how Globalization was the  major trend in last 30 years of the 20th century. He uses the development of the international standards that made the fax machine an everyday commodity as a case study of how this happened. Then he turns his attention to the world-wide food chain McDonald's to show how culture and technology give and take together in globalization. He then ends up with a discussion of the global Internet culture, but with a nod back to the previous chapter as he shows the military influences that developed the Internet.<br /><br />He ends up with a summary chapter called \\"The Question of Technology\\" where he discusses the dynamics between Science, Economics, Culture, and Change. It is here that Misa points out that the relationship between Technology and Society is a constant give and take. There is a sad note to this summation as he states that he feels the attacks of September 11, 2001 signalled an end to this era. He states that the reactions to these attacks do not fit a pattern of globalization, and goes on to say that the \\"vision of a peaceful world, economically integrated and culturally harmonious, knitted together by information technology, is dead.\\" He looks forward to a new era where reformers, social movements and groups of citizens embrace technological solutions to shape a new future.of the global Internet culture, but with a nod back to the previous chapter as he shows the military influences that developed the Internet. <br /> <br />He ends up with a summary chapter called \\"The Question of Technology\\" where he discusses the dynamics between Science, Economics, Culture, and Change.

Joyce Carol Oates says it is \\"a love story that concentrates upon the tension between two American 'pathways' : the way of tradition, or Law; and the way of spontaneous emotion-in this case, Love. In the synthesis of these two apparently contradictory forces lies the inevitable transformation of our culture.<br /><br />\\"Romantic love is one of our Western religions and must be respected as such; it must be acknowledged as the violent, unstoppable, rather beautiful force it is. But the West is also a culture of Law : American society will never be transformed by stray acts of violence in the streets-it will be transformed only through the courts. And they, in turn, will not be transformed until the men who run them are changed, individual by individual. Ours is still a time of romantic love; the time of a more communal, transcendental love is not yet come. DO WITH ME WHAT YOU WILL suggests such a transformation.<br /><br />\\"If what is available to an individual is romantic love, then it must be-it will be-this kind of love that liberates.\\" In the \\"freeing\\" from the enchantment of her \\"self,\\" Elena Howe lives a drama in which, by a continual process, she is raised to a higher aspect of her own being through involvement with a man-a drama of marriage and adultery that constructs an hour-by-hour, thought-by-thought experience both shattering and redemptive.\\"<br /><br />The critic Mary Ellmann says: \\"DO WITH ME WHAT YOU WILL combines the legal novel with the romantic triangle. Oates provocatively but not entirely successfully attempts to show the interconnections among the issues inherent in the two very different types of stories.\\"<br /><br />Another critic Rose Marie Burwell states: \\"Certain that the law will not save her, that the very concepts of innocence and guilt depend on the human propensities of those who define and dispense justice, the heroine of Joyce Carol Oates' sixth novel recognizes the truth that \\"Necessity Makes Law.\\" Assuming moral self-responsibility in the final chapter, Elena Howe enters an unspoken plea of nolo contendre, the vulgate of which is the title of the novel, Do With Me What You Will ( 1973 ). The plea, in English common law and in most states, requires the court to proceed on an assumption of the defendant's innocence--even though he refuses to defend himself. Here the reader is the court and Elena Howe is both Everyman and many women. The dilemma she has been chosen to exemplify, the struggle to create and retain a tenable sense of self, is a universal one in which every individual who achieves emotional and moral maturity participates. For Elena a belated and violent sexual awakening sounds a warning signal, forcing upon her the realization that she must synthesize her personality or accede to her own disintegration. Elena's resistance and the Jungian stages of her individuation provide the narrative structure of Oates' most subtle and complex novel yet.\\"<br /><br />This novel also provides a timeless look at the counter-culture and it relationship to the dominant culture in the 60s and 70s.

This is an early collection of Doonesbury strips from 1971-73. Mike Doonesbury, Mark Slackmeyer, Joanie Caucus, Zonker Harris, Boopsie Boopstein, B.D., and even Viet Nam Phred, join a host of other characters as they hang around their college town and face the follies of their time.<br /><br />Nixon was in the White House, and US troops were still in Viet Nam. Telephones were land-based, and TVs had rabbit antennas. Mark tries his hand at being a computer operator, then quits and goes on a tour of America with Mike in the sidecar of the motorcycle. They visit the Republican national convention, and later they campaign for McGovern. Joanie takes a job in a day-care center and tries to raise the consciousnes of the girls.

The time is 1923, and the couple lives in their country home in Sussex Downs. Mary is studying Theology at Oxford and busily involved in her research.<br /><br />The couple is visited by Miss Dorothy Ruskin, an amateur archaeologist from Palestine, who has returned to England to seek funding for her work. During the visit she leaves with Russell an antique papyrus letter that appears to be written by Mary Magdalene, an apostle of Jesus. It was given to Ruskin by a Palestinian who claims the document has been in his family for ages. Soon after she leaves, she is hit by a car in London and dies. Holmes and Russell are drawn into what appears to be a murder, but have a devil of a time figuring out who did it.<br /><br />What I like about this novel is the way that King creates the atmosphere of 1920's England. The old cars and trains, the buildings, the pace of life, and the people are all described in great detail. There is a lovely scene at a party on an old estate where Mary meets and gets help from Lord Peter Whimsey, another fictional detective, that is just filled with details about dress and manners. Another wonderful description is of a woman witness's hair style as Mary interviews her.<br /><br />However, it is a difficult stretch for me to envision Holmes falling in love with any woman, never mind a young orphan whose parents were killed in an auto accident. And although I feel that King develops and portrays a good partnership between Russell and Holmes (they call each other by their last names!), with each bringing their own strengths to their work together, I find it not believable when they close the door and are intimate together.<br /><br />Also, the plot is a murder mystery but the book resembles real life more than fiction. There are lots of suspects, and trails that go cold or lead nowhere. I can't fault the author for this bit of realism, but it is an interesting approach to the mystery novel.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the novel and plan to read the rest of the series. The friendship, based on mutual respect between Russell and Holmes, makes this a wonderful book, not so much as a mystery, but as a model of healthy male-female relationships.trails that go cold or lead nowhere.

With large print, lots of white space, and many drawings by James Sherman, this is really a quick read.<br /><br />Imagine all the jokes and put downs you have ever heard about loose women. Then imagine that there are three times as many that you haven't heard because they were too bizarre or off-color. Joan Rivers has put all these and more that you could never dream up in this short biographical sketch of her quintessential loose woman Heidi Abromowitz.<br /><br />Divided into twelve chapters with titles that range from Baby Bimbo to Hooker Housewife, Joan Rivers will introduce you to a wonderful collection of jokes about tramps, tarts, and teasers.<br /><br />Written at the height of the sexual revolution just before the recognition of the AIDS epidemic, some of the references to penicillin-treatable STDs may seem a bit insensitive by today's standards. While there is much in this book that will be humorous to the liberated reader, there is still plenty to upset the proper reader and the politically-correct.	2005-08-28

Cook says \\"these pictures were made as an exploration\\"  because she became fascinated with every father and daughter\\" she saw. She was \\"was anxious to understand their feelings for each other.\\"<br /><br />The book contains 70 full-page black and white photos each containing a father and his daughter(s). These are what one critic called \\"intimate yet still formal portrait photographs\\" in which the relationship of the subjects to each other is revealed through their placement, body language, points of contact, the setting, and the objects they chose to have with them in the pictures. In one, the subjects arise out of a sea of stuffed animals. In two others, the father and daughter have a book between them.<br /><br />The subjects had the opportunity to write brief essays about their relationship, but not all chose to do so. These words range from simple to profound as these people delve into their understanding of the father-daughter bond or their own personal relationships. Jaques Seguela, a  Parisian advertising executive, writes: \\"Men love women, as we all know, but actually they prefer girls, by which I mean daughters. Perhaps this is the crux of love, these father-daughter relationships that transcend tenderness and affection, in which admiration, too, transcends objectivity.\\" One father writes about how his daughter saved his life. Often the essays seem to be a way for the person, especially the daughters, to express the inexpressible.<br /><br />Fathers And Daughters begins with an introduction by William Saroyan, who appears in this book with his three daughters. He says:<br /><br />Mariana Cook has in this portfolio of pictures encompassing so many fathers and daughters achieved a substantial miracle of photography. There is not only a remarkable clarity of technique and vision but an ability to capture the nuances or relationship; one can assume that these moments, electric and vivid, are created out of that intuitive grasp of the revealing instant possessed only by the most accomplished artist. There is nothing lax or dilatory in any of these pictures; each has both precision and luminosity, and in each of them one can percieve the nearly visible energy that flows from the intimacy of kinship. That all of these images and arrangements and not entirely harmonious, nor without emotional tension, adds to their appeal, and to their honesty. What matters is the poetic grace with which the artist has arrested for a moment the humor, the tenderness and, most often, the love that underlie one of the best of all human connections.<br /><br />I bought this book for its portraits of famous people. Chinua Achebe, Harry Blackmun, Senator Bill Bradley, Vernon Jordan, Yo Yo Ma, Senator George McGovern, and General Colin Powell are among those depicted. I went on to love it for its honesty and its clear depiction of the best values obtainable in the father-daughter bond.

It has been around for thousands of years and is not a problem to be taken lightly.<br /><br />In Bertrice Small's The Love Slave, the author paints a picture of a woman whose life was so horrible, and whose slavery was so romantic that it is preferable to her original life. Set in the mid-tenth century, Regan is a Scottish girl whose family has been murdered by a neighboring clan. She is carried off by a Norse slaver to be sold in the slave markets of Dublin. Her outstanding beauty catches the attention of a Dublin trader who buys her as a present for the caliph of Cordoba. He must owe the caliph big time because, he not only fills a ship with goods, he also hires Karim the ship's owner, who is a Master at training love slaves, to train Regan to please the caliph.<br /><br />In addition to this book being in the Historical Romance genre, it is for mature audiences. The author describes in detail the sexual behavior of her characters. She has also done enough research to create historically accurate settings and characters. The caliph of Cordoba is based on the real Abd ar-Rahman III (891-961), the greatest and the most successful of the princes of his dynasty in Spain. He is accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the harem. Which is where we find him with Regan, whose name has been changed to Zaynab, \\"the beautiful one.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Zaynab and Karim had fallen deeply into eternal love during her training. Their parting in Cordoba breaks both their hearts and the reader spends the rest of the book wondering if they can ever be reunited. If you can stand the sexual heat, this is a great example of historical romance.<br /><br />The last words of the caliph Abd ar-Rahman III are said to have been \\"I have known only fourteen happy days in my life.\\" After reading The Love Slave, you will have a good idea how those days were spent.ding The Love Slave, you will have a good idea how those days were spent.	2005-07-31

The paintings were inspired by 20 fragments from the erotic short stories of Anais Nin published in the collection The Delta of Venus. These stories, written for a private collector of erotica in the 1940s, were published in 1974 at the height of both the Sexual and Feminist Revolutions.<br /><br />Judy Chicago found short fragments, five to seven lines long, that she found \\"riveting\\" and they became the inspiration for these paintings that \\"articulate a feminine perspective on sex.\\" The paintings depict genitalia and sexual activity, and use color and line to create an image of sexual excitement and passion.<br /><br />Each painting is depicted on a page of its own, with the text from The Delta of Venus that inspired in on the facing page. These are preceded by a page that has the title of the story from which the text was taken. It is a very simple presentation with a list of the painting titles and the date of composition at the end of the book. The paintings were done over a three year period from 2001 - 2003.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book are one page biographies of Anais Nin and Judy Chicago. These are followed by a nine page memoir of Anais Nin written by Judy Chicago that tells of their friendship and Nin's influence on her.

Like his first novel, Big Trouble, this work is set in south Florida, has elements of a crime novel, and is filled with the eccentric people that Barry creates so well. Unlike his books of nonfiction, both these novels contain what Mr. Barry calls \\"bad words.\\" This is because his novels contain \\"unsavory characters\\" and they use bad words. Not all the characters are unsavory. Most are just eccentric, funny, or  inept.<br /><br />Although this novel is not as laugh out loud funny as Big Trouble, it attempts to compensate for this by having much more actual violence and sex. Speaking of sex, the song \\"Sex Pootie\\" by the Seminal Fluids, which played  a prominent role in Big Trouble, makes a cameo appearance in Tricky Business. It must be a personal favorite of Mr. Barry.<br /><br />The story is about one of the gambling ships that leave Miami every day to go out three miles into international waters for a couple of hours of entertainment and return. It is the only ship to go out with a hurricane approaching. It does this because it is owned by a gangster who uses it to pick up smuggled drugs from boats coming from the Bahamas and he can't miss a delivery. All the events in the novel take place the day of the storm.<br /><br />If you like Dave Barry's humor, you will love his novels.	2005-07-17

She was great and so was the movie. So I took a chance on the book.<br /><br />The movie is very faithful to the book, but the point of view is different in each. While the movie is presented from Jean Brodie's point of view, the book gets more into the feelings of one of Miss Brodie's girls, Sandy Stranger. This change in perspective really helps the story because you see it from the point of view of a growing teenager whose perspective deepens and changes with age. Thus the shift that happens in Sandy from blind follower to rebellious foe, is much easier to understand in the book than in the movie.<br /><br />If you liked the movie, or if you are, like me, a fan of 1930's fiction, I think you will find this a rewarding book.	2005-07-14

It is his third book and still very funny. Much of the humor is based in New York and Jewish cultural idioms with a sprinkling of mock intelligentsia - all with the neurotic, self-absorbed insecure point of view that he made famous.<br /><br />The first piece, \\"Remembering Needleman,\\" is a satirical take off on scholarly obituaries. Only Woody Allen would think of bringing marshmallows to a cremation and to donate the ashes to a university for research.<br /><br />\\"The Condemned\\" takes a humorous look at Elie Weisel's Dawn where a man must decide whether to kill a truly evil person.<br /><br />\\"By Destiny Denied\\" is 7 pages of notes for an 800 page novel that was never meant to be written.<br /><br />\\"The UFO Menace\\" is Allen's take on the existence of UFOs.<br /><br />\\"My Apology\\" puts Woody Allen in Socrates' place as he faces death by hemlock.<br /><br />In \\"The Kugelmass Episode\\" the protagonist finds a magic way to cheat on his wife by going back in literature to have an affair with Emma Bovary.<br /><br />In \\"My Speech to the Graduates\\" we find Allen's philosophy most succinctly spelled out: \\"We are a people who lack definite goals. We have never learned to love. We lack leaders and coherent programs. We have no spiritual center. We are adrift alone in the cosmos wreaking monstrous violence on one another out of frustration and pain. Fortunately, we have not lost our sense of proportion.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Diet\\" explores the insecurities often associated with working in corporate America. A person only identified as F. deals with his work problems by taking control of the only thing he can - his food intake.<br /><br />\\"The Lunatic's Tale\\" is about a successful doctor who is driven crazy by his love for two different women. The ending is right out of a 1950's sci-fi movie.<br /><br />\\"Reminiscences: Places and People\\" is composed of one-page memories of Brooklyn, New Orleans, Paris, Mexico, and a meeting with a famous author.<br /><br />In \\"Nefarious Times We Live In\\" we are taken inside the mind of a person who attempts to assassinate a president.<br /><br />\\"A Giant Step for Mankind\\" takes a humorous look at scientific research.

A tightly plotted tale that includes homeless people, parents and their teenage children, Russian arms dealers, New Jersey hitmen, the FBI, a poisonous toad, and a herd of stray goats. In the process there is a series of attempted murders, three love stories, and a tribute to the wacky people of south Florida. This is his first attempt at writing a novel and it succeeds in being a very funny and well-crafted work. I can't wait to read his next novel.	2005-07-07

Of course none of the humor inherent in travelling post 9/11 could be included or even conceived of, which makes this book a prime target for a second edition. Also, much of the fun Mr. Barry has with the different European currencies and their value is now history with the appearance of the Euro.<br /><br />All this said, it is surprising how little the travel experience, and the insane humor if it, has changed in the past 15 years. His state-by-state and country-by-country mini-guides, as well as his general travel advice,  contain some great insights. I read this book while waiting in airports and on airplanes during a business trip, a perfect setting for this type of literature. It made me very happy that I wasn't travelling with any expectation of getting pleasure from the experience.	2005-07-07

As a writer and artist she has been a major voice in feminist spirituality for about 30 years. In this book she turns her attention and thoughts to the ancient goddesses of her home country Sweden. We get a powerful and personal work on the feminist roots of Norse mythology and their impact on Scandinavian history and the Saami and Vanir peoples of the region. The book is illustrated with 15 black-and-white reproductions of her art. A color reproduction of the author's painting Nordic Mother of the Animals is on the front cover.<br />The book tells the story of how the author explored and researched the sites and myths of the northern goddesses and the native peoples of Scandinavia who worshipped them. As such it is more personal than scholarly in approach and I reccomend it more to artists and feminists than to theologians and historians. Although the book is predominantly a feminist look at Norse mythology, there is enough information about the Saami people of northern Sweden to make it interesting to readers seeking information about them.<br />The Norse goddess is examined in her various manifestations as Hel, Freya, Frigga, Nerthus, Ilmatar, the four Ahkkas (Madder-Ahkka, Sarahkka, Juksahkka, and Uksahkka), and the three Norns (Urd, Verdandi, and Skald). The relationship of the goddess with the ancient Saami and Vanir peoples is explored as well as her eventual displacement by the Nordic male gods of the invading Indo-Europeans.	2005-06-21

The author's mother and aunt survived the Holocaust by disguising themselves as Polish Catholics in Italy. Her father escaped from Soviet Siberia and walked across Europe at the end of the war to join the sisters in Rome.<br /><br />What makes this story so interesting is that, after the war the sisters never came out of hiding as Catholics and convinced the author's father to maintain the pretense as well. They migrated to the USA and had two daughters that they raised as Catholics. It is only when the daughters are in their 30s that they start to suspect that their parents are keeping something from them.<br /><br />Helen Fremont blends together the two stories of her and her sister uncovering their parents Jewish past and their parents Holocaust survivor tale in a wonderful way that shows the intergenerational impact of lies and deception in a way that is still sensitive to her parents' desire to put the past behind them.	2005-06-20

I have to admit that I was attracted to The Destroying Angel initially because I thought it was a history of the health food movement in the US. I had just read The Road to Wellville by T. C. Boyle and was interested in determining the accuracy of this fictional treatment of Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. So I was a bit surprised to discover that this is a book on the history of what the author, a sexologist, calls Degeneracy Theory. Now I feel like I need to read some more history to verify the facts of this book.<br /><br />Anyway, I found out that Dr. Kellogg was accurately portrayed in the Road to Wellville. Congratulations Mr. Boyle for a job well done! However, while there is a very good treatment on the history of the health food movement in this book, it appears that the founders and major thinkers of this movement also had strong beliefs about sexuality. So while one third of this book is about corn flakes, whole grains and vegetarians, the rest of it is an outline of two pre-20th century mistaken theories on sexuality.<br /><br />The first of these is that masturbation causes disease. According to the author this came about because, before the germ theory, people felt that the symptoms of syphilis and other sexually contracted diseases, could be traced to \\"self-abuse\\" rather than contagious transmission. The second sexual theory treated historically in the book is that sexual excitement and the corresponding sexual release are injurious to the human body and should be avoided as much as possible. The combination of these two is what John Money calls Degeneracy Theory and he claims that their effects inhibit a sexually healthy society to this day.<br /><br />In an Epilogue called Theory Of Sex, Love, And Health Without Degeneracy, which is the longest chapter in the book, Money provides a wonderfully concise outline of Sexology as it was understood twenty years ago. Thus, while nothing he says is out of date, you will not find Viagra-like drugs mentioned.<br /><br />This was an important book for me. I have never seen the history of sexuality theory so well portrayed. John Money is at his weakest when, towards the end of the book, he relies on technical terminology which may discourage a general readership that is most in need of this information.<br /> <br />This was an important book for me.

In Doyle's A Scandal In Bohemia Irene Adler outsmarts Holmes and wins his lasting admiration. Carol Nelson Douglas has taken this story as the basis for a series of delightful mystery novels that include Holmes and his companion Watson in mysteries that run parallel to the Holmes stories.<br /><br />She has also created a framework for this continued series based on a current day historian Fiona Witherspoon who has supposedly discovered the diaries of Irene's companion Penelope \\"Nell\\" Huxleigh and unpublished memoirs of Dr. Watson that she blends into the novels of the series.<br /><br />In this outing the plot takes place around the events of Doyle's story The Naval Treaty. Irene and Nell run into an old acquaintance of Nell's, Quentin Stanhope, dressed in Eastern garb, feverish, and quite unkempt. When they take him home, an attempt is made on his life. As they try to uncover his attacker, they find the answer may lie in events at the British battle of Maiwand in Afghanistan nine years earlier that link Stanhope to Dr. Watson and a mysterious spy known as Tiger.<br /><br />This is an excellent story that should appeal to readers familiar with the tales of Sherlock Holmes, but who seek a more feminine and feminist point of view on the period and the characters.	2005-06-04

Each double page illustration shows a cutaway view of an old Victorian building that has five stories and a basement with six apartments. The residents vary, with three families on the first three floors, an actress and her maid on the fourth floor, and an artist and a crazy inventor in two small apartments on the fifth floor. The author has added the maintenance crew, a homeless person seeking temporary shelter, a couple of burglars, and even an alligator that prowls the sewers beneath the basement.<br /><br />Each of the 14 illustrations shows the events in the house at different times of day, starting at 7 am and ending at one the following morning. The drawings are richly populated with interesting details and the dialog is neatly confined to the sidebars. This is a sumptuous treat for the visually inclined and the residents' stories will keep you interested to the very end. However, with all the activity depicted in this one day, it does not look like a place I would like to live in for long.	2005-06-02

There is a lot of graphic descriptions of both violence and  male arousal. Yet if the reader is open-minded enough to get past these, this is a well crafted adventure novel by one of the masters of the field.<br /><br />The novel pits Farmer's versions of Tarzan and Doc Savage against each other in a fight to the death over the secret of eternal life. Farmer calls these foes Lord Grandrith and Doc Caliban, and tells the story from the point of view of Grandrith. Also, it turns out there is another secret these two share that they must discover before they kill each other.<br /><br />There are enough explosions, deaths, and dismemberments for a summer Hollywood adventure blockbuster, but Farmer has added a strange twist to the story that makes this risky material for the screen. As the novel opens, Grandrith finds that he becomes physically aroused to the point of climax whenever he kills someone. This is very distracting for him, as he must outwit his most deadly enemies while his body is being drawn towards other feelings.<br /><br />This is difficult material to handle and Farmer does it superbly, and with a touch of humor, while keeping the excitement level high. Leave it to the creator of Riverworld to invent such a fantastic story line and carry it off superbly from beginning to end.<br /><br />Is this the original slash fiction (fan writings involving fancied romantic liaisons between fictional male companions)? Most articles about slash trace it back to 1970s fan fiction depicting romantic adventures between Star Trek's Kirk and Spock. A Feast Unknown was first published in 1969, a date that precedes the earliest dating for slash so far. However, regardless of whether this novel has anything to do with slash fiction, it is a great work on its own terms that was certainly groundbreaking at the time and can still be controversial to this day.	2005-05-29

It is retold by the award-winning author Philip Jose Farmer, a person who has written his own variations on Tarzan and Doc Savage African adventures.<br /><br />In this book Hareton Ironcastle gets a message from an explorer who is in a little explored region of Africa and has found plants and animals fantastically different than any others on Earth. Ironcastle gathers together a small group of adventurers to check out the fantastic claims and his only daughter convinces him to take her along.<br /><br />In their attempts to find the lone explorer and to discover the eerie secret of this remote land, they face strange hostile tribes as well as domineering plants and hairy reptiles.

In the first book, Kushiel's Dart, Jacqueline Carey introduces the reader to an alternative past for France called Terre d'Ange which is a land founded by Jesus and Mary Magdalene's son Elua and his 12 followers. Kushiel's Dart is Phedre, a young woman who was sold into prostitution by her mother, but who was raised to be a spy. After many adventures she foils the plot of Melisande Shahrizai to take over the country and becomes a national hero and a comtesse. However, Melisande escapes punishment in a mysterious jailbreak.<br /><br />This second book picks up the action when Phedre receives a clue that Melisande may be hiding in La Serenissima, our modern Venice, and goes in search of her. As with the first book, there are lots of adventures, narrow escapes, and court intrigue. Many new characters are introduced and the struggle between Melisande and Phedre continues. There is even less BDSM than in the first novel, although the theme is still present.<br /><br />There are enough background details in Kushiel's Chosen that it can be read without having read Kushiel's Dart. However, I can't see too many people wanting to do this. The plot structure of the two books is very similar which might irritate some readers of both books. Hopefully in the third, the author mixes it up a bit. Still, an impressive creation full of detail and very tightly developed for such a large book.	2005-05-10
US	52229186	R2NNFLTJTYRW84	0515037060	76005789	Memos from Purgatory	Books	4	8	9	N	Y	Classic Ellison from 1961	Memos From Purgatory is two books in one - both of them memoirs rather than fiction. The Gang is the first book and goes back to 1954 when the 20 year old Ellison went \\"undercover\\" in a Brooklyn street gang for ten weeks. His depiction of gang life is very well done, but the writing is a bit dated by the constraints of the censorship of the time. It is all here, from his initiation, through his relationships with the gang members, up to the rumble with a rival gang that drove him off the project for good.<br /><br />The second half of the book called The Tombs is from a time seven years later. Ellison was an established writer living in New York when he gets arrested and spends a day in the New York prison system before he makes bail. This seems to have been a harder experience for him than the ten weeks in the gang. He fears that he is going to lose his mind because of the panic reaction to being incarcerated. Since one night in jail doesn't seem to be so tragic, his whining can make this section of the book difficult to read. My personal guess is that Ellison was a control freak and being in jail was more than he could take. Yet his descriptions of the people he meets there is richly rewarding. His criminals, winos, derelicts, and guards are well portrayed and typical of the style of writing that has made him famous.<br /><br />What makes this book a classic is the visceral and emotional writing style that Ellison employs. Even when I disagree with him most, in his diatribe against two gay black men in The Tombs, I am still taken with the power of his writing.	2005-04-21

Illness, Compulsive Disorders, Teen Pregnancy, Alcoholism, Drug Addiction, Gay Child-Abusing Priests, AIDS, Kidnapping, Robbery, Prostitution, Compulsive Eating Disorders, Cross-Dressing, and Murder are all treated in a matter-of-fact way, but can at times make this a hard novel to get through. Yet the character development and the author's sensitive approach to the human situation make this a wonderful novel.<br /><br />Emer Martin takes us into the lives of a dysfunctional, but strong and resilient family as each member faces a crisis in their lives and comes to terms with themselves and their situation. Not for the feint of heart, but still heart-warming, this is a novel that looks at the personal within a global setting.<br /><br />The setting is global with the characters circling the globe in search of a missing sister. Ireland, New York, Japan, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Honduras, Mexico, and Cuba are all there and lend this novel a truly global perspective.	2005-04-12

The author takes his main character, Maureen Birnbaum, a Jewish American Princess from a New England finishing school whose values are fashion and marrying well, and sets her in classic sci-fi settings of authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs, Isaac Asimov, and H. P. Lovecraft.<br /><br />Each story is introduced by Maureen's whiny friend, Bitsy Spiegelman, who she visits between adventures to relate her latest tale. Sword-wielding Maureen, in her jewel-encrusted golden bra and g-string is a stereotypical, yet strong and distinct character who provides a refreshing gender-reversal to these traditionally male-oriented tales.<br /><br />The first story begins when Maureen accidentally transports herself from a ski slope in Vermont to the Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs. She arrives there naked and saves a prince from \\"big giant things with four arms\\" by killing them with a sword dropped by one of his fallen warriors. She keeps the sword and he gives her the gold bra and g-string worn by his slain sister. However, even though she has fallen in love with the prince, she can't live with only one outfit on a planet without stores, so she bids him a tearful goodbye and returns to Earth to go on a shopping trip with Bitsy.<br /><br />Her shopping skills are impecable and she runs up quite a bill on Bitsy's Mum's credit card. She sets off for Mars, but, not knowing how this transporting actually works, ends up in another Edgar Rice Burroughs setting, The Center Of The Earth where the sub-human inhabitants force her to be their High Priestess. She doesn't like the way they treat her and wants to get back to her Martian prince so she once again goes back to Bitsy.<br /><br />Stories follow where she keeps missing Mars and ends up in various sci-fi settings. The next is Robert Adams, post-nuclear war Earth of the Horseclans series. This is followed by the planet in Isaac Asimov's Nightfall. She then takes on Robin Hood and has a shopping contest with Maid Marian in a Contemporary British mall named Sherwood Forest. The last three stories find her, still missing her Martian goal, searching for the Holy Grail, caught up in Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, and taking a trip to a NASA lunar colony.<br /><br />It is never explained how Muffy transports herself, but the stories are written for fun rather than realism. The saving grace of the stories are their humor and the character development of Muffy and Bitsy. While Bitsy pursues the traditional middle class dream of a successful marriage, kids, and a house in the suburbs, Muffy's adventures bring out a strong feminist philosophy in her. Her description of the Holy Grail as the sacred cauldron of the triple goddess throws the Medieval monks into quite a tizzy. By the end of the series, Bitsy's marriage has gone bad and Maureen has begun to realize that she may never get back to her prince.<br /><br />This anthology contains the eight Muffy Birnbaum stories that Effinger wrote between 1982 and 1993. I don't know if Effinger wrote any more stories in this series before he died in 2002. While it might seem that only experienced sci-fi readers knowledgable in the sub-genres of the parodied authors would enjoy these stories, they actually have quite broad appeal.

New York	This is the latest entry in a series of novels based on the fictional character Irene Adler Norton from the Sherlock Holmes story A Scandal In Bohemia. This is also the second volume of a duology that began with Femme Fatale. In this latest volume Irene is in New York City of 1889 and seeking to uncover if her mother is the infamous Lola Montez. If that is not enough, she gets drawn into Holmes' case involving threats to the Vanderbilt family.<br /><br />Carole Nelson Douglas has a delightful way of blending fictional and historic characters together with her own strong feminist point of view to re-envision the role of women in the nineteenth century.  In this particular foray, we see the lives of Lola Montez, Alva and Consuelo Vanderbilt, and reporter Nellie Bly re-examined through the feminist perspective of Irene Adler and her partner in detective work, Nell Huxleigh.<br /><br />Douglas has also developed a delightful multi-narrator style for revealing her story that mixes entries from various participants into a lively manner of plot evolution. This is offset with \\"quotes\\" from various historical sources that introduce each chapter. These two narrative devices are well executed in this particular story.<br /><br />So take an exciting journey into late 19th century New York and explore the mysteries that Ms. Douglas unfolds. She has an excellent attention to detail and history that brings the subject to life.	2005-03-13

Leigh Jones adeptly straddles multiple genres to create an exciting tale. She crosses a romance novel with detective fiction and with an alternative reality setting that includes witches, vampires, and wereleopards. The author's greatest achievement is in creating a vibrant lead character, Olivia Peters, who captures the mystery of believability and raises the work above the cliches of genre.<br /><br />The author reimagines the sleepy southern city of Raleigh North Carolina as a place where vampires are regular citizens. However, a vampire turf battle leads to a series of murders that upsets the community.<br /><br />The romance is between Peters, a victim of a wereleopard attack as a child, and Luka, the leader of the local wereleopard clan. Can the erotic feelings he stirs up in her overcome her childhood fear? Her interactions with his pack of wereleopards in human form are delightfully portrayed. Their mixture of human emotions and animalistic senses as she is attracted to their leader and how she relates to each of them is very well done.<br /><br />It is the detective who comes out as the strongest part of Peters' character. She is called in to solve the murders, but the struggle for control of the vampire community hints at a more complex story. Yet ultimately, this is set aside (for a sequel?) and the romance novel gains the upper hand.	2005-03-05
US	52229186	RTN6WKRSI8H0P	0140167188	294881452	The Road to Wellville	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Great historic novel on the health movement in the US	The Road to Wellville takes the reader to Battle Creek Michigan at the beginning of the 20th century, a place and time where the modern health food and breakfast food industries were born. Two men arrive on a train and we follow their experiences in Battle Creek. Will Lightbody arrives with his wife Eleanor to go to the famous Sanitorium run by John Harvey Kellogg seeking a cure to his digestive problems. Charlie Ossining wants to make it rich quick in the breakfast cereal industry started by Dr. Kellogg's brother William and his competitor C. W. Post.<br /><br />Although the novel is written in the third person, the reader sees the story evolve through the perspective of these two men. Other characters suffer from this approach, especially the women like Eleanor Lightbody, whom Will and Charlie never seem to understand.<br /><br />The novel differs from the movie, which remains true to the plot and characterization, in that the novel portrays the inner longings and motivations of these two men, while the movie stresses the visual aspects of what they see and do. This makes the movie both funnier and a bit more removed than the novel.<br /><br />The historicity of the book is well developed. Most of the people, places and events can be confirmed from the record. This is a great book to read if one is interested in healthy living and wants to know the background of today's health movement.	2005-02-27

Written in 1933 during the Great Depression, it is a gritty look at the hopelessness of the average person looking for meaning in a materialistic world. Although West is the son of Jewish immigrants, he writes convincingly of the Christian answer to hopelessness, faith in God. Wonderful characters portrayed in a Noir-ish style reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler deal with the big question of the Meaning of Life yet find no easy answers.<br /><br />The Day of the Locust is much more fully realized than Miss Lonelyhearts. If Miss Lonelyhearts is a parable, The Day of the Locust is a novel. Characters and plot are more developed and West spends more time developing the setting, which is a bleak mid-century Hollywood.<br /><br />Tod Hackett is a Yale graduate who has been hired to work for a Hollywood studio as a set and costume designer. He falls in love with Faye Greener, a woman who seems incapable of love, but knows how to use her beauty. Sadly, she lacks the talent to achieve her goal as an actress. Tod is just one of the men drawn to Faye's charm. There is a fast-talking midget, a slow talking cowboy, a Mexican who raises fighting roosters, and a lonely retired motel clerk. The novel is more about the dark side of the Hollywood of dreams. West uses his characters to paint a bleak and lonely view of a city of lost angels driven by hope.	2005-02-07

She is high-strung and self-absorbed, and doesn't always make the best choices. Yet the story is quite captivating. I really enjoyed the author's historical research which brought early 20th century North Carolina to life for me. One of the male love interests seems straight out of the Romance Genre with his demanding ways and her weak-kneed infatuation for him, but the rest of the characters were more three-dimensional.<br /><br />Ms. Booth states that many of the events portrayed in the novel are true with names changed and facts rearranged, and begs local readers not to take offense. This adds a sense of mystery which may intrigue local readers. I feel this book will be a good read to anyone from coastal Carolina who wants insight into local life a century ago. Although my grandparents aren't from North Carolina, I enjoyed reading this historic novel of romance and coming-of-age. It took me back to a much simpler time and made it compellingly real.	2005-02-04

You don't have to read the other books to read one since each stands on its own, but once you start, you may, like me, never be able to stop.<br /><br />This new translation really helps bring this book to life for the modern reader. Most of Zola's novels were translated when written over a hundred years ago. These original translations are usually the only choice English-language readers have. While good, they are somewhat dated, and a new translation of a Zola novel is an event of great importance. Arthur Goldhammer does a wonderful job of both being true to the time it was written and yet sensitive to the modern reader. There are occasional footnotes to explain some terms, but they are not bothersome nor do they interupt the flow of the work.<br /><br />In The Kill Zola takes the reader to the Paris of the Second Empire where Napoleon III is transforming the city into a modern marvel. Large, wide, straight new boulevards are being built to provide access to the the heart of the city.<br /><br />Many people are getting rich in real estate speculation. The protagonist Aristide Saccard, has come to Paris to make a fortune for himself. He knows he can do it if he could just find someone to provide him money to get started. He hears of a rich daughter who needs a husband since she was raped and is pregnant, and strikes a deal with her and her family to a marriage of convenience. With the money he gets from marrying Renee Saccard, he builds a fortune on shady deals and speculation.<br /><br />Renee is a bored sensualist who takes lovers and attends all the parties she can. She is left to raise Aristide's teenage son, Maxime, another sensualist, who today would be called a Metrosexual. Together, the two explore the sexually liberated world of 19th century Paris and eventually become lovers.<br /><br />Character development and portrayal are excellent in The Kill. Zola shows us the inner workings of this amoral family and the world in which they travel. Although the ending is a bit weak, the characters and plot are excellently developed.<br /><br />This is the second time I have read this book and I love the new translation.

As a writer and artist she has been a major voice in feminist spirituality for about 30 years. In this book she turns her attention and thoughts to the ancient goddesses of her home country Sweden. We get a powerful and personal work on the feminist roots of Norse mythology and their impact on Scandinavian history and the Saami and Vanir peoples of the region. The book is illustrated with 15 black-and-white reproductions of her art. A color reproduction of the author's painting Nordic Mother of the Animals is on the front cover.<br /><br />The book tells the story of how the author explored and researched the sites and myths of the northern goddesses and the native peoples of Scandinavia who worshipped them. As such it is more personal than scholarly in approach and I reccomend it more to artists and feminists than to theologians and historians. Although the book is predominantly a feminist look at Norse mythology, there is enough information about the Saami people of northern Sweden to make it interesting to readers seeking information about them.<br /><br />The Norse goddess is examined in her various manifestations as Hel, Freya, Frigga, Nerthus, Ilmatar, the four Ahkkas (Madder-Ahkka, Sarahkka, Juksahkka, and Uksahkka), and the three Norns (Urd, Verdandi, and Skald). The relationship of the goddess with the ancient Saami and Vanir peoples is explored as well as her eventual displacement by the Nordic male gods of the invading Indo-Europeans.	2005-01-08

One summer evening in 19th century France, an angel visits a Burgundian farmer named Sobran. They share a bottle of wine and talk through the night. They promise to meet again each year on the same evening.<br /><br />Each chapter of the book is named after a different French wine term and there is a chapter for each subsequent year. Some are very short and others relay the detailed events of the year leading up to the angelic liaison. I often couldn't see any relationship between the chapter title and the events depicted. Also this linear approach to a farmer's life moves slowly and I was often tempted to stop reading. However, the characters are warm and engaging and I kept with the book to see how they were doing. A charming book with realistic characters and good development.<br /><br />I would have liked this book even more if it tied itself more deeply to the history of 19th century France. While the characters form a close-knit communal group, they seem only very peripherally connected to the events of the world around them.	2004-12-29

The results is one of the best books on the phenomenon of miraculous apparitions ever to be written. Although he starts locally with Boardman, he spends most of his time in Medjugorje and Rome.<br /><br />Medjugorje is undeniably the most important miraculous appearance of our time and is often compared to those at Lourdes and Fatima. Sullivan provides wonderfully balanced reporting, while at the same time he is open enough to show how his interviews have personally influenced him. He does a wonderful job of presenting the many points of view on these events, yet is always reaching for the objective truth behind the presentations  of the seers, the Church, the theologians, the believers, and the scientists.<br /><br />My favorite chapter comes towards the end of the book when he interviews Father Benedict Groeschel. He quotes Groeschel as saying:<br /><br />\\"If you no more  than dismiss these things, you're simple an obscurantist. If you mindlessly embrace them, you're just a dope. we have to resist the obsessive-compulsive demand for a clear, definitive answer to these questions.

However, if you come to it to either prove or disprove a preconceived idea, you will probably feel upset with the author's approach.	2004-12-12

The story has been retold in many novels, even in opera.<br /><br />It is the tale of the lovely and innocent Beatrice Cenci, who in late 16th century Rome was molested by a corrupt and powerful father, Count Francesco Cenci. Her father was so well-connected that there was no one, not even the Pope, to whom she could turn for protection. So, with the help of her mother and her brother, she seeks the ultimate revenge and pays the price.<br /><br />Shelley's poetic drama is considered one of the best works of his short life. His treatment is more Shakespearean than poetic, but without the immortal bard's light comic touches. The Cenci is true tragedy through and through with a poetic touch that will capture the soul of the reader. I found myself reading passages aloud to myself to both hear the dramatic content and to better understand the meaning of dialogs broken into lines of poetry. This is not an easy book to read, both for its subject and its writing style, yet the reward is well worth the effort. Some of Shelley's greatest lines are in this work. Here is a brief segment from the 5th Act of Beatrice's words in contemplating her fate:<br /><br />Oh, trample out that thought! Worse than Despair,<br /><br />Worse than the bitterness of death, is hope;<br /><br />It is the only ill which can find place<br /><br />Upon the giddy, sharp and narrow hour<br /><br />Tottering beneath us. Plead with the swift frost<br /><br />That it should spare the eldest flower of spring;<br /><br />Plead with awakening earthquake, o'er whose couch<br /><br />Even now a city stands, strong, fair, and free;<br /><br />Now stench and blackness yawn, like death. Oh, plead<br /><br />with famine, or wind-walking Pestilence,<br /><br />Blind lightning, or the deaf sea, not with man!<br /><br />Cruel, cold, formal man; righteous in words,<br /><br />In deeds a Cain./>In deeds a Cain.	2004-12-12

Adler is a feminist alternative to the pipe-smoking Sherlock Holmes, complete with a female sidekick, Penelope Huxleigh, who documents her exploits as Dr. Watson did for Holmes.<br /><br />In Good Night, Mr. Holmes, the first novel of the series, Ms. Douglas has written a prequel to A Scandal In Bohemia in which we learn how Irene and Penelope met and how they got caught up in the scandal that introduces Sherlock Holmes to their lives.<br /><br />The pairing of the  ultra-respectable Penelope, the country parson's daughter, with Irene, the convention breaking American singer, provides for entertaining situations that liven up the investigative plot.

Books	5	2	3	N	N	Large Doses of Swashbucking Adventure	I saw Renee Zelweger and Vincent Dinofrio in The Whole Wide World and was fascinated by the story of Robert Howard. My only contact with the Conan stories have been through contact with the late 20th century caricatures rather than the author's original works. Having felt that Conan has become such a cultural stereotype, I wanted to see the source material.<br /><br />Howard portrays Conan as a man outside of the civilization of his time. Cimmeria is portrayed  geographically as being where Scotland is today, only at some remote time in Prehistory before the forming of the North Sea. His normal costume is a silk loincloth and a sword. When it is cold he will take up a red cloak and in battle, he often adds chain mail.<br /><br />In Black Colossus, Howard describes him as tigerish, elemental, and untamed. His profession in these stories is predominantly a mercenary. When he can't find work fighting, he tends to resort to thievery. Occasionally his leadership skills propel him into the role of King, Pirate Captain or War Chief, but his direct approach doesn't find a happy home in situations where diplomacy and discretion are important traits.<br /><br />He appeals to women for his elemental nature and his protective strength. Women of his acquaintance normally wear fairly revealing and diaphenous clothing that they tend to lose a lot. Nudity seems to be a fairly common situation for women of his time since this lack of attire seldom causes much of a stir.<br /><br />Then there is the swashbuckling. Do not read these stories if you are not a big fan of it. Conan tends to fight his way out of most situations, and the combination of his large broadsword and his amazing strength causes a lot of bloodshed and dismemberment. I had to take these stories in small doses for this reason.<br /><br />The end of the book has some really wonderful items for those who want something more. The editors have included an early draft of the first Conan story, The Phoenix on the Sword, an untitled draft, and a couple of synopses written by Howard. There are also some writings by Howard on the Hyborian Age, the mythic time he created for these tales. These added touches make this a wonderful book for the more serious reader. However, all fans of this genre will find these stories essential reading.

They start when in 1919, to avoid persecution, Rifka and her parents and two older brothers have to suddenly leave Russia in the middle of the night with just a small backpack and the clothes on her back. One of these few possessions is a book of Pushkin's poetry given to her by her cousin Tovah. Their destination is the United States where two of her brothers already live.<br /><br />To calm her fears and give her something to do during the lonely hours of travel, Rifka starts to write letters to Tovah in the blank spaces in the book. The story evolves through these letters which Rifka knows she will not be able to mail until she reaches the US. In the book, each letter is preceded by a quote from a Pushkin poem.<br /><br />Rifka's trip is not easy. She gets separated from her family and it takes over a year before she learns if she will be reunited with them. At a time when Jewish children are normally surrounded with family celebrating their coming of age, Rifka is alone and in charge of her own destiny.<br /><br />The book excels in character development, historic accuracy, and plot. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in immigration stories, Jewish history, or young women's literature.	2004-11-13

This book provides a very personal glimpse into the story behind those headlines. The book tells the story of Mende Nazer in three basic parts: her early life in the Nuba mountains; her capture and life as a domestic slave in Khartoum and London, and her escape from slavery and attempts to establish asylum.<br /><br />Her life in the Nuba tribes of southern Sudan reveals much about the culture and values of these people. Mende Nazer portrays the Nuba as simple farmers with a proud culture who are at the mercy of the Arab Sudanese of the north. Although slavery is technically against the law, there seems to be a lively black market which the Nuba appear helpless to stop.<br /><br />The family that buys Mende when she is 12 takes great caution to hide her condition from officials while they brag about their slave to family and friends. Mende's perspective as a child wrenched from her tight family structure and seeking to comprehend the world through the eyes of a slave, makes for compelling reading. Reading this book is a great way to put a human face on what is happening in Sudan. Highly recommended.	2004-10-17

However, this book is by Ernesto Guevera, a 23 year old middle-class medical student looking for a break from his studies, and the motorcycle doesn't last through two countries. It is a rare glimpse into the young mind of a major cultural revolutionary. The book is also a unique look into the everyday life of South America in the middle of the 20th century. The point of view is of sons of privilege wandering the countryside and living off the land. Sometimes they are encountering the workers and experiencing their simple hospitality and honest struggles. At other times, they rely on their social class and education to open doors to more polite society. What I found compelling about this book is that in such a brief work the author was able to present a sweeping portrait of South American life. it was, for me, a wonderfully human introduction to the people and lands of this vast continent.	2004-10-17

Victoria Woodhull was one of the most outrageous and most influential of the 19th century social reformers of the United States. Yet today many people do not know who she is.<br /><br />This book, which is based on Amanda Frisken's doctoral dissertation takes a detailed look at the most important period of Woodhull's career while glossing over the periods before and after. Another interesting aspect of the work is that it uses primarily the reports published in men's illustrated newspapers of the time, called sporting news, as a source. Other sources are used to provide a rich and detailed picture of Woodhull's life, beliefs, and activities, but the unique perspective of this work comes from this original use of these popular newspapers as a source for images and opinions about Woodhull.<br /><br />There may be better biographies that look at her whole life, but for those interested in Woodhull's impact on the USA, this is a great book to read. Included are her free love sexual philosophy, her campaign for president of the United States, her brokerage firm on Wall Street, her newspaper, her influence on American socialism, and her leadership of the Spiritualism community. There are tons of footnotes, but the text can be read without reference to them so it has relevance to both the popular and the scholarly reader.	2004-10-03

Frank Baum available again with a new Foreward by David Maxine and a new cover illustration by Eric Shanower. The author wrote various adventure series under pseudonyms, while publishing his more famous Oz novels under his own name.<br /><br />In this volume the boy fortune hunters take a job running guns from Australia for wealthy Colombians who are planning a revolution. The guns come in handy when they end up run aground during a typhoon on a tropical island full of hostile natives who worship a Pearl God. They have the richest pearl beds in the world and keep them secret by killing anyone who lands there.<br /><br />Fortunately the Columbians have a Louis Bleriot Antoinette biplane in crates below deck. Louis Bleriot was famous in Baum's time because in 1909 he was the first person to fly across the English Channel. Using the biplane to fly themselves in and out of trouble with the local islanders, the boys have life-threatening adventures and stuff their pockets with lovely pearls.<br /><br />The book's leading characters are full of White supremacist attitudes that jar the sensibilities of modern readers. However Baum relates these with an innocence that would be difficult to recreate today. In addition to being an adventure tale for young white boys, the book provides an interesting look into how racial stereotypes were presented at the beginning of the 20th century.	2004-08-21

On the other hand, if you read Scott Adams' Dilbert comic strip before you read the headlines of your local paper, or if you find yourself LOL at most of his cartoons, you  have already committed this book to memory and don't need this review.<br /><br />Dogbert's Top Secret Management Handbook is a combination of reprinted Dilbert comic strips from the first half of the 1990's and a management handbook written as if it were the work of a cartoon dog named Dogbert. The cartoons are funnier than the handbook. I gave up reading the book linearly and read the cartoons first. Then I went back and read the management handbook.<br /><br />The cartoons work better because you get to see Scott Adams view of management both from the manager's point of view and also from that of the dumbfounded workers. It is this juxtaposition of manager logic and worker reality that makes the Dilbert strips so funny.<br /><br />The text of the handbook is entirely one-sided. You get to see the world from the unrelenting point of view of the demented management expert. The cruel logic is there, but you, the gentle reader, are forced into the role of Dilbert facing the twisted thinking of middle management. You may laugh on the outside, but you may be crying inside. I do not recommend reading this book before spending lots of time with your own manager.	2004-08-21

Frank Baum available again with a new Foreward by David Maxine and a new cover illustration by Eric Shanower. The author wrote various adventure series under pseudonyms, while publishing his more famous Oz novels under his own name.<br /><br />In this volume the boy fortune hunters team up with a Navy Lieutenant and a Central American Indian prince to find Tcha, a hidden Atlantean city in the heart of the Yucatan jungle. Equipped with lighter-than-air flying suits and electric stun-guns, fanciful inventions of Baum's fertile imagination, the group of nine adventurers take on two native Indian tribes and the secretive Atlantean culture to garner some of their fabulous wealth of gold and rubies. They overcome mosquitoes, warrior bands, blood sacrifices, and even an earthquake on their way to their goal.<br /><br />The white male chauvenism of the early 20th century is evident in the writing, but can more interesting than offensive as a period piece that illustrates the prejudices of the time. Baum's take on Atlantean culture is certainly the most intriguing part of this standard boys' adventure. David Maxine in his Foreward draws some interesting parallels between this real world fantasy and Baum's magical land of Oz. Most outstanding of these are that the Tcha people are ruled by a teenage girl and live in a communist society in peace and happiness. This is a book that will interest Baum fans like me and those interested in adventure stories of the past.	2004-08-15

Although Peter Macinnis traces the story of sugar from its origins in New Guinea through to the 20th century, he does so in a very entertaining rather than comprehensive way. As such, this is a good introduction, but will leave the reader with many questions unanswered.<br /><br />The subtitle, The Story of Sugar could really have been The Story of Sugar and Slavery since, according to the author, this form of forced labor has been so integral to the success of the crop. In fact I am sure that the \\"Bitter\\" half of the title is a reference to slavery. Macinnis states that not only the institution of slavery, but also the global politics of Colonialism, has its foundation in the global production of sugar.<br /><br />So as you can see, the world as we know it has to a large extent been molded by the story of sugar. Thus this book, or some other like it, is important reading for a good understanding of modern world history. Being an Australian gives the author just enough distance from the European and American sugar empires to tell the story with a balanced and somewhat objective point of view.<br /><br />The book is illustrated with black-and-white maps and each chapter ends with a historic sugar recipe. There is a two page glossary of terms related to sugar production as well as a seven page bibliography of further readings. There are no footnotes to break the narrative.<br /><br />This is a great introduction to the story of one of the most important cash crops in world history.	2004-08-08

The author's text and the photographs by Alexander Vertikoff together present a well-rounded introduction to bungalow style through brief looks at over 75 specific examples of bungalow architecture.<br /><br />In a chapter called \\"In The Land Of The Bungalow\\" the book starts with a brief history of the origins and growth of the architectural style and its place in American history. This chapter is followed by brief treatments of specific aspects of bungalow style: the outside, porches, the inside, fireplaces, built-ins, and furnishings.<br /><br />Then the author and photographer take us to five different cities to look at examples of bungalows in each. Sample bungalows in Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago and Washington DC are highlighted in two to four page spreads. Each house has a description and history of the house and some information on the current owners. This is followed by some photographs of specific features with captions describing each.<br /><br />The book ends with a bibliography and lists of organizations and architects in each of the five areas highlighted.<br /><br />This is a lovely book. The bugalows are beautifully photographed. The endpapers are sheet music for the song \\"In The Land Of the Bungalow\\" by George F. Devereaux. The cover has a color print of a crewel embroidery of dragonflies. It is a labor of love that is a delight to read and a treat to the eyes. If you love bungalows, this is the book for you.<br /><br />I got this book because I am planning to remodel the kitchen and bath of my 1930 bungalow and was looking for ways to do so while retaining the original integrity of the house. This book has given me the ideas I need to move forward with confidence.	2004-08-08

Translation Series)	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	New translations of three thought-provoking love stories	LOVE contains new translations of three love stories by the infamous author of Venus in Furs, whose name has come down to us primarily as the term for a variety of sexual behaviour. But do not expect to find women with whips standing over cringing men in these tales. Sacher-Masoch was a much more complex writer who was considered a new Goethe by some of his contemporaries.<br /><br />This book is a very good English-language introduction to the writings of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. Not only does it provide new translations of three of his novellas, but it also has a six page Afterword by the translator that shows how these works fit into Sacher-Masoch's body of literature and literary themes. The author was planning a series of 36 novellas to be collectively called The Legacy of Cain. It was to consist of six stories on each of six themes: Love, Property, The State, War, Work, and Death. Only the two cycles on Love and Property were finished and finding English translations of any of them besides Venus in Furs have required the resources of major university libraries. This book contains the first three novellas of the Love sextet along with the prologue to the series which is called \\"The Wanderer.\\" There appears to be an awakening scholarly interest in Sacher-Masoch's writings. This is the second book of translations by Michael O'Pecko, and Virginia Lewis has also recently translated a new book of the author's Jewish stories.<br /><br />\\"The Wanderer\\" is the prolog to the whole Legacy of Cain series. In it a civilized man who is out hunting comes across a holy mystic wandering in the Carpathian mountains. The holy man attacks the narrator for being a hunter, a killer. A discussion begins in which the mystic claims we are all infected with the legacy of Cain's sin. The just person can only flee the world and its enticements to avoid the six things that are Cain's legacy: Love, Property, The State, War, Work, and Death. Confronted with this \\"Truth\\" the narrator returns to his village to ponder. The prolog ends and the stories begin.<br /><br />Don Juan of Kolomea tells the tale of a man who falls in love and marries. He is blissfully happy until his wife has children. Feeling neglected by her, now that she spends her time with them, he seeks out lovers. But he can never recover the feelings of true love that he first had with his wife.<br /><br />The Man Who Re-Enlisted tells another story of true love led astray. This time the lovers are young and poor. They are deeply in love, but her great beauty draws the attention of a rich man. She chooses security and wealth over true love and poverty. Yet this is a small town and the two must see each other in passing as the years go on. We see the man's unending love yearning for the unattainable through the eyes of his fellow villagers.<br /><br />In Moonlight, a married woman becomes bored with her life in the country and takes her husband's friend as a lover. Everything comes crashing down when her husband finds out, and she is left only a shadow of her former self, playing Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata night after night.<br /><br />These stories take us into another world. This is the 19th century in the Carpathian Mountains of rural Austria-Hungary. The people who live here were called \\"Little Russians\\" because they spoke a dialect of Ukrainian. Today we know them as Rusyns or Western Ukrainians. If you are looking for the Hollywood version of love that conquers all, these are not the stories for you. But if you want to see how the impulse of love plays out against the realities of 19th century life and, despite the intensity, doesn't always have a happy ending, you will find much to enjoy here. Sacher-Masoch will take you to another time and place and fill your soul with the poignancy of his characters.returns to his village to ponder.

It tells the story in simple yet thoughtful and elegant language. Starting with the bomber crew, the book explains the bombing in context of World War II and its effects on the city and people of Hiroshima. The author takes you into the lives of two sisters and shows how the bomb changed everything. Then the book goes on to explain the aftermath with people dying of radiation sickness even years after the bomb was used. Lastly, it describes the current state of the world's nuclear powers and the threat of nuclear winter.

The detail of 19th century New York life and personalities makes this a delightful work for lovers of this period.<br /><br />Yet  within this framework, this fictional mystery novel also takes a probing look at the status of women in 1870s New York. The title Scarlet Women refers to the depiction that women had few choices other than prostitution to earn a living at the time.<br /><br />One of the reasons I read and liked the novel is that it gives an accurate and sensitive portayal of the famous 19th century feminist, spiritualist and free-thinker Victoria Woodhull. Even 130 years later, some of her ideas are still too liberal for mainstream America!<br /><br />So if you like your detective novels with a strong feminist flavour and historical accuracy I recommend this book. It succeeds as a mystery, a social commentary, and a historic novel.	2004-07-26

It was originally serialized in a French newspaper and created quite a stir with its strong positions on women's rights, worker communes, and anticlericalism.<br />I originally started to read this book because I was interested in the legend of the wandering Jew. This is a mythical person cursed to live forever and wander without rest because he refused Jesus a place to rest as He carried His cross to Calvary. Although the wandering Jew and his equally long-lived sister Herodias, who gained her longevity because of her involvement in the death of John the Baptist, make occasional appearances in the book, the story is really about the heirs of Herodias, seven members of the Rennepont family. So if you are seeking a work on the legend of the wandering Jew, I recommend you do not read this book.<br />The Rennepont family lost their position and most of their wealth during the French persecution of the Protestants. What was left of the Rennepont fortune was entrusted for 150 years to a Jewish banker and his heirs who were loyal to the family. Over the course of time through wise investments, the small inheritance was carefully nurtured into a fortune.<br />Any surviving members of the Rennepont family were directed to meet at a certain address in Paris in 1832 by bronze medallions cast in 1682 that have been passed down from generation to generation. Those present on the given date will divide the inheritance. This book is the story of the seven members of the family left at this time. They are Jacques Rennepont, a Parisian workman who favors drinking and the wild life; Francis Hardy, an enlightened industrialist who has built communal living quarters for his happy workers; Rose and Blanche Simon, twin teens who travel with an old soldier from Siberia where their mother has just died to Paris; Adrienne de Cardoville, a beautiful and independent-minded woman of means; Abbe Gabriel, an orphan who has been raised by the Jesuits, and Djalma, an Indian prince.<br />Two Jesuits and a female accomplice have devised a plan to keep the Renneponts from their inheritance and to claim it for the The Society of Jesus. They hope to obtain the fortune to secure their futures and pay for the rehabilitation of the Order.<br />The story moves from one cliffhanger to another throughout the book as the struggle between the family and the two Jesuits unfolds. The Perils of Pauline and A Series of Unfortunate Events come to mind as contemporary stories with similar plot devices. This structure is a byproduct of the newspaper serialization. However, Eugene Sue is a master of his craft and he develops the various subplots with great skill. Characters are well-developed and scenes are vividly described. It is sad that this book has been out of print for so long. A new edition with a modern translation would be a great literary treat.o Paris; Adrienne de Cardoville, a beautiful and independent-minded woman of means; Abbe Gabriel, an orphan who has been raised by the Jesuits, and Djalma, an Indian prince.<br />Two Jesuits and a female accomplice have devised a plan to keep the Renneponts from their inheritance and to claim it for the The Society of Jesus.

The monarchy had just been restored and the Royalists were returning to England.<br />Bruce Carlton is a returning lord whose family had lost everything during the Cromwell period. He is on his way to London when he stops in Amber's village for the night. For Amber, it is love at first sight and she begs him to take her with him. However, to Bruce, Amber is \\"a woman any man would like to have for a mistress, but not for a wife.\\" She is beautiful, desirable, and sensual. Yet she is also vain, unscrupulous, wanton, and ambitious.<br />Sleeping her way to fame and fortune, Amber is not a likable heroine.  As a character, her devotion to Bruce is her saving grace. Yet she is a woman who loves too much an unattainable man. So even her undying love doesn't redeem her.<br />What finally makes this novel work is the history. Kathleen Winsor does an excellent job of portraying the turbulence of Restoration England. She superbly portrays the intrigues of King Charles II and his court, the upheaval of British life caused by reformation and restoration, and London consumed first by plague and then by the Great Fire.<br />The prior Puritanical period was swept aside by a royal court of relaxed sexual morals into which Amber fit particularly well. Forever Amber, while banned in Boston when it was published in the 1940s for its portrayal of the loose morals of the court, actually contains no no descriptions of sexual intimacy. Dozens of times the author makes it clear that something happened without ever describing it. Depending on the reader this can be a strength or a weakness of the book.	2004-07-10

This book starts out slow and I was tempted to stop reading it often during the first 300 pages.<br />It is a hard book to read. There is a six page Dramatis Personae that lists the major characters and it can be very confusing at times. The second half is easier as less characters are introduced and the action kicks in big time.<br />The author sets up an alternative historical France that she calls Terre D'Ange, the Land of Angels, at around the time 800CE. There is a whole alternate theology based on the son of Jesus (Yeshua in the book) and the Magdalene.<br />The book reminds me of The Hobbit in the sense of it being an epic adventure through many lands and past many challenges, but the hero is a woman and a masochistic prostitute at that. The book is more sensual than explicit with a free love theology as a theme. However, the emphasis is on the machinations of courtly politics and war.<br />Once the action starts, it is hard to put down.	2004-05-11

Carol Nelson Douglas has taken the brief outline of Irene Adler in the Sherlock Holmes adventure A Scandal In Bohemia and fleshed it out into a marvelous sleuth of her own design. She has created her own series of books with Irene Adler as a 19th century detective with a feminist flair.<br />Adler's latest two-part adventure, Chapel Noir and Castle Rouge, is told through a series of journal entries by her female companion Penelope Huxleigh. Additional chapters are supposedly taken from notes written by a prostitute called Pink and sections of a mysterious yellow book of anonymous authorship. This multiple &quot;authorship&quot; allows Douglas to present her story from different perspectives.<br />And what a story! In Chapel Noir Adler is called on by Baron de Alphonse Rothschild to investigate a particularly bloody murder in a Parisian bordello. Before long Jack the Ripper is the suspect and Sherlock Holmes (sans Watson) has come to Paris to investigate. As the plot moves on, more famous historical figures are drawn in either as suspects or allies. 470 pages later I found, instead of the end, that this is the first of a two part story.<br />A rollicking adventure that continues for another 470 pages in Castle Rouge. Lots of fun if you can stand the gruesome aspects of the crimes.	2004-04-29

This particular book attracted me because I am the parent of two teen-age daughters. Having close contact with the problems my daughters face in the modern world I felt would help me understand the issues of Hasidic young women. Although the book is not designed to give a rigorous introduction to Hasidism, I am quite delighted by Stephanie Levine's work and the chance it has given me to have a glimpse into the spiritual and mundane issues of modern Lubavitch Hasidism.<br />Far from being a broad review of young Hasidic women, Levine focuses on the Lubaticher sect of Hasidism and its community in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York. She spent over a year living with and interviewing the students, teachers, and parents associated with the Bais Rivka Lubavitch high school, a girls-only school.<br />Hasidic girls have very little contact with males outside their immediate families. Their religious beliefs allow them only the slightest contacts with the world outside their community. Popular videos and music are not allowed and dietary restrictions only allow eating in the most kosher of restaurants. The &quot;mavericks&quot; part of the title has to do with the rebellious response that the young women sometimes bring to these severe restraints.<br />The &quot;mystics&quot; aspect of the title has to do with the deeply spiritual aspects of Hasidism where every thought and action of an individual's life has cosmic implications as the community does all it can to bring about the coming of the messiah. The last chaper of this book, &quot;Into The Future,&quot; begins with a wonderfully clear and concise description of Lubavitch mystical beliefs.<br />The irrepressible joy and exhuberance of the young women, that the spiritual practice of Hasidism seems to promote, leads to the author's use of the term &quot;merrymakers&quot; to describe the subjects of this book.<br />Levine starts off the book with a general introduction to the Crown Heights Lubavitch community and the background to her study. She talks about the Bais Rivka school and its students.<br />Then in a series of seven chapters she takes in depth looks at seven of the young women she was able to get the closest to in her year of research. We meet their families and see their day to day life. We hear them describe their current life and aspirations. As the most important duty of a Lubavitch woman is to marry and have children, their mate selection and preparations for married life are part of these chapters.<br />The last chapter contains a look at the future for both the young women and the Hasidic movement. This is a wonderful book for anyone like me who is interested in Hasidism or the lives of young women in the modern world. Levine is a wonderful writer and she treats her subjects with fondness and respect. Yet she is honest and direct. So this study has both objectivity and admiration, a delightful combination in such a work.a general introduction to the Crown Heights Lubavitch community and the background to her study.

Once he is a knight, he begins his second quest to find the Grail Castle and discover its secret.<br />A parallel story tells of Broaditch, a servant from his mother's castle, who sets out soon after to find Parsival. The two quests compliment each other with short episodic chapters from each telling the tale of the book.<br />The book is not for the squeemish. There is a war and lots of bloodshed.

Initially I felt the title referred to this s&amp;m relationship. However, as the author reveals more of Rachel's life, it appears that there is nothing natural in her emotionally starved world. Her parents fought bitterly when she was a child. She struggles with paralyzing spells of depression and is incapable of emotional closeness. She is delightfully articulate and quick witted - an intelligent woman with a large share of emotional distress. We watch her spiraling deeper into a suicidal state and it takes a strong reader to maintain compassion. Finally her darkest hour passes, and the novel ends with her first steps towards a healthier self concept. Compelling reading and wonderful character development - a great first novel.	2004-03-25

With Forever Fifty And Other Negotiations she explores with insight and humor the joys and fears of being in your fifties. The book contains 24 one-page poems that are accompanied by full page graphic illustrations in green ink on a rich cream paper. The 24 graphics are reproduced on the end papers. The attention to design makes this a wonderful gift for a quinquagenarian friend.<br />The poems are funny and sentimental yet bittersweet. In some poems we see a person who is struggling to accept the limitations of middle age (where running wild is to go for a walk without sunscreen and memory can't be relied upon).  In others she seeks the joys that come with the wisdom of years as when she says \\"We're quicker to laugh, and not so eager to blame.\\" In yet others, she makes affirmations to live life  \\"as a sexy old lady\\" and lists the things she'd like to do before she goes.<br />There are poems that take humorous looks at adult children, long-term marriage partners, and young doctors.<br />Overall, a wonderful but light look at the aging process of the 50s. It is a book you will enjoy, but one that will not burn into your soul.	2004-03-18

Frank Baum's World of Oz: A Classic Series at 100 (Children's Literature Association Centennial Studies)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Oz gets full scholarly approach	This collection of nine essays published by the Childrens Literature Association takes a scholarly approach to L. Frank Baums popular childrens books and the 1939 MGM movie. Written primarily by college and university professors in English, Literature, History, and Film, these well-written and insightful articles provide detailed analysis of the Oz phenomena in American culture.<br />The book divides the essays into three sections: Origins of Oz; The World of Oz; and, Oz On Stage And Screen. There is also an Introductory review article which looks back on the first one hundred years of Oz criticism called Analyzing Oz: The First Hundred Years.<br />The essays look at Baums frontier days in South Dakota, the origins of his vegetable characters, the meanings of home and humor in Baums works, different schools of Ozian criticism, Fred Stones portrayal of the Scarecrow, Baum as the first filmaker of Oz, and Dorothy as a cultural icon. The text is illustrated with black and white drawings and pictures and each essay has a bibliography of sources.<br />Reading criticism of Baum and Oz is no where near as much fun as reading the original works themselves. But after you have read Baums writings, it is useful to see how historians and academics view the cultural phenomenon that is Oz.	2004-03-17
US	52229186	RWK4LEZ6IAMEU	0140298444	524924959	S.: A Novel about the Balkans	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The horrors of war from a woman's perspective	March, 1993 - A boy is born in a Swedish hospital. Instead of cuddling the baby, the mother turns away. She doesn't want to touch it. She feels nothing but animosity towards the tiny creature. She considers suffocating it but can't stand the thought of another death.<br />Her mind goes back in time to May when she was a school teacher in a Bosnian village.<br />In short, terse sentences she relives the horror of the Serb soldiers emptying the town and her life in a prison camp. Thus begins months filled with humiliation, torture, rape, and murder. The uncertainty and helplessness of the victims of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" and the selfishness that is essential to survival are related in chapters whose titles are locations and months.<br />The book reads like a journal with each chapter being a month, but is told in the third person with occasional thoughts in the first person in italics. People and towns are reduced to initials. The Serbs are not even given initials - they are just a nameless death-dealing terror that surrounds the women of the camp.<br />This is a story of the horrors of war as it is experienced by women, but it also tells the tale of the courage and resilience of the human spirit. Hard to read, but important, this is a great piece of writing that will be appreciated by students of the Balkan tragedy and by those who can stand to face the stark realities of war.	2004-02-13

The album contained 12 songs by the 5 Rolling Stones. This book contains 40 years of photos by 20 photographers. It was published in conjunction with an exhibit of the same name held at the Govinda Gallery in Washington, D.C.<br />The photos are grouped by photographer in roughly chronological order, and each has a caption giving the year, names of the people, and location. Each photographer has written a statement about working with the Stones that is at the beginning of their photos. The 20 sets run from two to ten pages, with half of them four pages long. A majority of the photos are black and white. While many are candid shots, studio shots and album covers are also included.<br />Some shots are band shots, but many of the photos are of one or a couple of the Stones. Mick Jagger appears in 61 different photos, with Keith Richards in second place at 49 photos. Although Brian Jones died early in their career, he has third place with 23 photos in this collection. Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts are tied with 16 photos each. Bringing up the rear are Ron Wood with 7 photos and Mick Taylor with 5. Also appearing are various celebrities like Jimi Hendrix and Andy Warhol.<br />This book is a visual experience with the text providing background for the photographs, not the Rolling Stones. So if you want to read about the career of the Rolling Stones, this is not the book for you. If you want a visual experience of the Rolling Stones, and you like to read photographers' notes about their work, then this is a great book for you.	2004-02-01

With simple black and white illustrations and a humorous first person voice, the author outlines her attempts to develop loving relationships with the various men in her life. Starting when she was 15 in 1950, we see her grow and develop, but never quite connect. Yet she never looses her sense of humor. We get to laugh and cry along with her and, hopefully, the reader will come away with a better understanding of male-female relationships as I did.	2004-01-31

Most are accompanied by illustrations reproduced from the original text. Each tale is from a different country or region and together they provide a wonderful cross-section of Jewish life at the end of the 19th century.<br />&quot;Bessure Towe&quot; (Good News!) is the story of  how a unfortunate man (a Prosteck) wins a dowery for his daughter through his faith in the Talmud.<br />&quot;Rabbi Abdon&quot; is about a elderly scholar and his son, who is more interested in farming than study.<br />In &quot;Lewana,&quot; Nahum Bukarest wants to get from Belgrade to Constantinople. He meets a beautiful woman who offers him passage on her father's ship but gives him much more than he bargained for.<br />&quot;The Meal Of The Pious&quot; tells the story of Adolf Tigerson, the official clown of the Jewish community in Lindenberg, and his happy married life with a pretty and clever woman. This story is a fine example of &quot;the wisdom of a fool.&quot;<br />&quot;David And Abigail&quot; tells the story of a Jewish soldier returning to his village from the Danish army after a war is over decorated with a medal in the form of a cross for bravery. This leads to a discussion in the synagog as to whether a Jew can wear a cross and remain devout.<br />&quot;Shimmel Knofeles&quot; is actually a story about how his beautiful wife outwits a Polish suitor who won't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer.<br />&quot;The Bookbinder From Hort&quot; is  my favorite story. About a bookbinder who reads every book he binds, and to whom WORK WAS HIS PRIDE AND READING HIS HAPPINESS.<br />&quot;Galeb Jekarim&quot; is a Talmud scholar who decides to walk to Jerusalem.<br />&quot;How Slobe Gets Her Sister Married&quot; tells the story of a young woman who must find a spouse for her older sister in order to get married.<br />&quot;Mrs. Leopard&quot; tells the story about how a Jewish widow takes revenge on the town's outspoken anti-Semite.<br />&quot;Handsome Kaleb&quot; is a spoiled and vain young man who seeks to marry well. This story tells how he finds his rich bride.<br />&quot;Praise Be God, Who Gave Us Death!&quot; tells of the last days of ancient Father Menachem. A wonderful presentation of Jewish death and burial practices.<br />&quot;Sholem Aleichem&quot; tells of a young man who goes to the United States to get his family out of debt.<br />&quot;Machsheve&quot; is about a rich but superstitious merchant who overcomes his fears to save his son.<br />&quot;The Angel Of Death&quot; has a wonderful dialog between an ascetic man and a moderate Jewish woman.<br />&quot;Haman and Esther&quot; tells how a play at a festival brings together unlikely lovers.<br />&quot;Deliverance&quot; is the story of a young woman who is wasting away because of a forbidden love.<br />&quot;The Tragedy In Rose Lane&quot; is a Jewish version of Romeo and Juliet.<br />&quot;Kitty Parsley&quot; is the story of a woman who gains inner strength through confronting adversity. Here we see Sacher-Masoch's use of fur garments to show a woman's self esteem.<br />In &quot;The False Thaler&quot; a counterfeit coin helps a man win his love's hand.<br />In &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; scientific medicine confronts faith healing.<br />&quot;The Iliad of Pultoff&quot; relates a struggle between the tzaddik leader of the local Chassidim and a worldly Jewish woman.<br />&quot;The Story Of the Roman Matron&quot; is a fable about a woman who marries her 1,000 slaves randomly to each other with disastrous consequences. The moral of the tale is that marriage is more than just law.<br />&quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot; shows how the word &quot;Jew&quot; was used as an insult in society and what it really meant to be a Jew.<br />&quot;Bear And Wolf&quot; tells how two feuding families reconcile during Yom Kippur.<br />&quot;Two Kinds Of Nobility&quot; is the last story in the book. It shows how the Jewish tradition honors intelligence and talent as much as wealth.<br />There is an &quot;Afterword&quot; by the translator, Dr. Virginia Lewis, in which she discusses how the author, a non-Jew, came to know the Jewish community and to write these stories. A &quot;Bibliography&quot; at the end of the book lists 14 German-language books of Jewish stories written by Sacher-Masoch. In the last 100 years only one other has been translated into English, A Light For Others And Other Jewish Tales From Galicia. Jewish Life compares well with this other book and both are recommended to readers interested in stories of 19th century Jewish culture. The stories in Jewish Life are shorter than those in A Light For Others and simpler in construction, yet they reveal much insight into life in the Jewish communities of the time.in the book.

Books	5	3	3	N	N	A wonderful portrait of the Canadian landscape	Originally published in 1967 to celebrate the Centennial Year and Expo, this 1983 3rd edition is the latest.<br />This book divides up pictures of Canada into five regional chapters:<br />The Maritimes;<br />Into Quebec;<br />Ontario;<br />The Prairies;<br />British Columbia.<br />At first sight the book is a picture book with text pages limited to 10%. However the text pages and the captions to the pictures are so well written that they make the book a lasting treasure. Geographic and historic facts are beautifully mixed with descriptive images and phrases of poetic grace in brief but powerful captions to photographs that are so vast they often require more than one page.<br />Here is a caption for a picture of the Canadian Rockies:<br />The prairie begins its transformation into foothill and then to mountain once you have passed the 110th meridian of longitude. Farther south, in Colorado, the moment arrives some eight meridians of longitude farther east, the Canadian prairie being wider than the American because the Rockies swerve easterly south of the border. After the swells of the foothills come the waves of the rockies, grey, minaretted, the earth in tempest all the way to the Pacific. Yet, in the troughs of these waves are the absolute stillness of the valleys and the perfect reflection of the mighty rocks in placid, glacier-fed lakes.<br />What is lacking from the book are the people of Canada. Most of the pictures are landscapes with a few architectural photos added. Where there are people in the pictures they arepart of the background. The only portrait is one of the author at the end of the book.	2004-01-18

This book is not a favorite of mine. If it had better vegetarian recipes i would have rated it higher.<br />The author does have a 2 page section on Suggestions For Vegetarian Menus, but she basically says that a strict vegetarian diet &quot;gives little scope for planning meals.&quot;<br />However, for someone seeking some authentic Caribbean recipes, this book may be just the thing. Also, the book is filled with lots of basic recipes like hot cocoa, waffles, and white bread. Like most island cuisines there are lots of recipes for fish and chicken, and there are lots of dishes that rely on tropical fruits and vegetables.<br />I have found one recipe so far that I am enjoying called Pineapple Drink. I love pineapple but seldom buy it because it feels so wasteful to trim so much of the pineapple. This recipe males use of the pineapple trimmings and turns them into a refreshing beverage. It has changed my attitude towards buying pineapples. Here it is:<br />Pineapple Drink<br />Ingrdients:<br />peelings from one pineapple plus two sliced of the fruit<br />small piece of dried orange peel<br />1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg<br />a few cloves<br />6 cups of boiling water<br />sugar to taste<br />Put peelings, clove and orange peel in a jug and pour on boiling water. Cover and leave for one day. Strain and sweeten. Sprinkle in nutmeg and stir. Use at once or bottle and keep for 1 to 2 days. Serve with ice.<br />For the two slices of fruit, I use the very top and bottom slices and I also use the core in making this beverage. Also I have found that fresh orange skin works just as well as dried.	2004-01-18

The author takes his main character, Maureen Birnbaum, a Jewish American Princess from a New England finishing school whose values are fashion and marrying well, and sets her in classic sci-fi settings of authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs, Isaac Asimov, and H. P. Lovecraft.<br />Each story is introduced by Maureen's whiny friend, Bitsy Spiegelman, who she visits between adventures to relate her latest tale. Sword-wielding Maureen, in her jewel-encrusted golden bra and g-string is a stereotypical, yet strong and distinct character who provides a refreshing gender-reversal to these traditionally male-oriented tales.<br />The first story begins when Maureen accidentally transports herself from a ski slope in Vermont to the Mars of Edgar Rice Burroughs. She arrives there naked and saves a prince from &quot;big giant things with four arms&quot; by killing them with a sword dropped by one of his fallen warriors. She keeps the sword and he gives her the gold bra and g-string worn by his slain sister. However, even though she has fallen in love with the prince, she can't live with only one outfit on a planet without stores, so she bids him a tearful goodbye and returns to Earth to go on a shopping trip with Bitsy.<br />Her shopping skills are impecable and she runs up quite a bill on Bitsy's Mum's credit card. She sets off for Mars, but, not knowing how this transporting actually works, ends up in another Edgar Rice Burroughs setting, The Center Of The Earth where the sub-human inhabitants force her to be their High Priestess. She doesn't like the way they treat her and wants to get back to her Martian prince so she once again goes back to Bitsy.<br />Stories follow where she keeps missing Mars and ends up in various sci-fi settings. The next is Robert Adams, post-nuclear war Earth of the Horseclans series. This is followed by the planet in Isaac Asimov's Nightfall. She then takes on Robin Hood and has a shopping contest with Maid Marian in a Contemporary British mall named Sherwood Forest. The last three stories find her, still missing her Martian goal, searching for the Holy Grail, caught up in Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, and taking a trip to a NASA lunar colony.<br />It is never explained how Muffy transports herself, but the stories are written for fun rather than realism. The saving grace of the stories are their humor and the character development of Muffy and Bitsy. While Bitsy pursues the traditional middle class dream of a successful marriage, kids, and a house in the suburbs, Muffy's adventures bring out a strong feminist philosophy in her. Her description of the Holy Grail as the sacred cauldron of the triple goddess throws the Medieval monks into quite a tizzy. By the end of the series, Bitsy's marriage has gone bad and Maureen has begun to realize that she may never get back to her prince.<br />This anthology contains the eight Muffy Birnbaum stories that Effinger wrote between 1982 and 1993. I don't know if Effinger wrote any more stories in this series before he died in 2002. While it might seem that only experienced sci-fi readers knowledgable in the sub-genres of the parodied authors would enjoy these stories, they actually have quite broad appeal. These sci-fi settings have become such a part of pop culture, that all readers will enjoy the tales even if they miss some of the deeper references to the classic series.with Maid Marian in a Contemporary British mall named Sherwood Forest.

Then this is the self-help book for you!<br />With a delightful blend of insightful research, tongue-in-cheek sarcasm, and laugh-out-loud humor Arthur Bloch takes a wide-ranging look at self-help techniques that will keep you in stitches while providing a basic introduction to New Age thinking. In 23 brief chapters Bloch manages to introduce and poke fun at Meditation, Visualization Techniques, Spirit Guides, Chakras, Inner Child Therapy, Positive Thinking, Past Life Regression, Alternative Medicine, Shamanism, Angelic Guides, Channeling, and some techniques new to this book like Wishful Thinking, Blame-Fixing, and Positive Forgetfulness.<br />Even if Wishful Thinking is not your idea of the solution to your problems, the delightful humor of this book will go a long way towards giving you a happier life.	2004-01-05

It portrays how, in just three generations, a proud and free people can be transformed into abject but loyal slaves.<br />The story starts in Africa where Tamboura is drugged by his brother and given to a slave trader. He is transported to the coast where he is sold to a slave ship captain and transported to Cuba.<br />Like the first book in the Falconhurst series, Mandingo, Tamboura is used by his new owner as a sire to breed new slaves. Only Tamboura and his owner's mistress decide on a breeding campaign all their own. When the cuckolded \\"master\\" finds out, he has Tamboura killed and his mistress flees to New Orleans with Tamboura's child in her womb.<br />She calls Tamboura's son Drum and raises him as her slave rather than her child. He becomes a fighting slave who is famous for beating all competitors.<br /><br />His son Drumstick is sold by his white grandmother when he is 17 to Hammond Maxwell of Falconhurst Plantation. This is the same Alabama plantation where the first novel of the series is set. So the last third of Drum takes us back to the characters of the novel Mandingo.<br />Onstott has a great talent for bringing this period and this subject to life. He writes about interracial male and female relationships and slavery while remaining true to both races and sexes.	2004-01-01

The war was characterized by brutal genocidal activity on both sides.<br />The stories are arranged in chronological order which allows the reader to see the progress of the war as it was experienced. This book presents an important female perspective on the horrors of war.<br />The first story, \\"Homecoming,\\" portrays the outbreak of the war as the young girl Ifeyiwa and her family flee for their lives to their home town.<br />\\"Mama Alafi,\\" the second story, is about a Kafa woman and her family who live among the Ogboji at the onset of the war. Although they have been respected members of the community, the men of her family are all slaughtered before her eyes because the war has made them enemies.<br />\\"Ndende,\\" the third story, tells the tragic story of Mama Ekene who gives birth during an attack on her village by jet fighters.<br />\\"The Saboteur\\" relates the story of two officers, Ejaik and Ezem, who are in competition for the same woman. Ejaik is a ladies man who gets on well with women, while Ezem is his superior officer who uses his authority to terrorize both the woman and Ejaik. Ezem tries to have Ejaik killed so he can have the woman to himself.<br />\\"Win The War,\\" the next story, tells the effects of kwashiorkor, a disease of severe malnutrition, on the young children of the Ahura Win The War Primary School by relating the events of one day at their school.<br />\\"Ifeguluonye\\" is a story of Emeni whose husband and six sons are all killed in the war. Left alone, she goes into extreme grief and, after the war, she takes on the clothes and habits of a man and changes her name to Ifeguluonye, which means Whatever Pleases One.<br />\\"Happy Survival\\" tells the story of the people of a village who are attacked by bombers just after the cease fire is announced. They experience the loss of their loved ones and the relief of the end of the war at the same bittersweet moment.<br />\\"Ike And Pitakwa Ladies\\" is a story that takes place after the war. Ike is one of the few men to return from the war and has a job in the new government. He is in the city for a conference and decides to enjoy the pleasures of the city ladies while he is away from home.<br />Each story has a moment when a character states \\"When rain beat the cow in the eyes\\" after a particularly poignant scene. Although never explained, this seems to be a Nigerian phrase that connotes a particularly cruel or upsetting turn of events.<br />The stories of this book plunge the reader into the middle of a civil war.

Venus Bound is one chapter in the story of censorship in the 20th century. It tells the story of  Olympia Press, a small publishing company in Paris, and its owner Maurice Girodias. More importantly, this book relates how some of the classics of 20th century literature got published in the 1950s, a time when censorship of sexually explicit writing made it impossible for these works to be published in either the UK or the USA.<br />The subtitle of this work states that the book is about the press and its writers. Sadly, Maurice Girodias, who was writing the second volume of his autobiography at the time, refused to be interviewed by John De St. Jorre. So although the book is about Girodias and his life's work, there is a sense of detachment to the book. Questions that Girodias could easily have answered are answered indirectly or not at all. Yet this treatment allows a complex vision of Girodias to appear as his actions and motivations are described by the authors and employees of Olympia Press.<br />Olympia Press made money by commissioning erotic novels from English-speaking writers in Paris who were in need of an income. These were sold under pseudonyms to a readership in the USA and UK where such books were illegal. If that was all Olympia Press did, it would probably have faded away into obscurity with the liberalization of the laws of censorship.<br />However, Olympia Press was the only publisher at that time that would risk publishing much more substantive novels that couldn't be published elsewhere because of censorship. Whole chapters of Venus Bound are devoted to the stories behind the publication of J. P. Donleavy's The Ginger Man, Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita, Candy by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg, Story of O by Dominique Aury (under the pseudonym Pauline Reage), and William Burrough's Naked Lunch.<br />This is a fascinating book about a mysterious and excitable Maurice Girodias who battles the censors and his own writers in court to maintain the Olympia Press. Although this is a book about erotica, the treatment is  scholarly and there is nothing here that will offend any but the most sensitive readers. It will appeal to those who have an interest in the history of censorship or who want more information on any of the works published by Olympia Press. At the end of the book are a Chronology,  a Olympia Press List of titles, and a Bibliography.lympia Press.

The first volume covered the origins of the human race through the first civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. The second volume in the series reviewed the early cultures of India and China and then moved on to discuss Greek civilization. The third volume covered the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, from 800 BCE to 600 CE. The fourth volume surveyed the rise of Islam, the Arab empires, the decline of the Byzantine Empire, and the beginnings of modern Europe. The fifth volume offered a first look at Japanese, African, and American cultures and also brings the stories of India, China, and Europe up to the 18th century. The sixth volume looked at the forces that formed the modern face of Europe and colonialism's effects on the whole world. The seventh started with the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and Urbanization and went on to explore the French and American Revolutions, Napoleonic reforms, the nationalist revolutions of the mid-Nineteenth Century, the US Civil War, and British political reform.<br />This eighth volume is focused on the European and US empires of the 19th century and their effects on world cultures. It includes sections on the dynamics of empire building and the relations between the various European countries. Then the book explores the effects of European and US domination on South America, Africa, the South Pacific, India, China, and Japan. It next explores the stresses on European empires and colonialism created by socialism, new technologies, population growth, and nationalism. The book ends with a study of the causes, tactics, and outcomes of the First World War.<br />This is a book filled with photographs, maps and illustrations. Every page has at least one, and most are photographs of famous persons, events, or scenes. The text is well written and emphasizes brief summaries rather than scholarly examination. This makes it a good basic introduction and outline, but may be less useful to someone who wants to look at these subjects in greater depth. The lack of any bibliography of further readings is also a drawback for those wanting to seek more information. A two-page time chart of the period helps to put events in perspective. The chapter contents are confusingly placed at the end of the book, but they are well done and helpful for getting an overview of the author's approach. A two page listing of all the books in the series with their section and chapter titles helps to put the material into the broader view of all world history. All in all this is a great brief introduction to European and American colonialism in the 19th century. However the emphasis is decidedly European, and the author's British background is most strongly felt in this volume of the series.<br />The type face is large and the lines are amply spaced. Couple this with the copious illustrations and the book is actually a very quick read for its size and length. It is a few steps above the approach of Dorling Kindersley books that are predominately illustrations with supporting text. With Roberts, the text is the major part, but the illustrations are definitely more than an after thought. This is a good introduction for the general reader. It is not going to be a lasting reference book that you will turn to again and again.a good basic introduction and outline, but may be less useful to someone who wants to look at these subjects in greater depth.

It was originally serialized in a French newspaper and created quite a stir with its strong positions on women's rights, worker communes, and anticlericalism.<br />I originally started to read this book because I was interested in the legend of the wandering Jew. This is a mythical person cursed to live forever and wander without rest because he refused Jesus a place to rest as He carried His cross to Calvary. Although the wandering Jew and his equally long-lived sister Herodias, who gained her longevity because of her involvement in the death of John the Baptist, make occasional appearances in the book, the story is really about the heirs of Herodias, seven members of the Rennepont family. So if you are seeking a work on the legend of the wandering Jew, I recommend you do not read this book.<br />The Rennepont family lost their position and most of their wealth during the French persecution of the Protestants. What was left of the Rennepont fortune was entrusted for 150 years to a Jewish banker and his heirs who were loyal to the family. Over the course of time through wise investments, the small inheritance was carefully nurtured into a fortune.<br />Any surviving members of the Rennepont family were directed to meet at a certain address in Paris in 1832 by bronze medallions cast in 1682 that have been passed down from generation to generation. Those present on the given date will divide the inheritance. This book is the story of the seven members of the family left at this time. They are Jacques Rennepont, a Parisian workman who favors drinking and the wild life; Francis Hardy, an enlightened industrialist who has built communal living quarters for his happy workers; Rose and Blanche Simon, twin teens who travel with an old soldier from Siberia where their mother has just died to Paris; Adrienne de Cardoville, a beautiful and independent-minded woman of means; Abbe Gabriel, an orphan who has been raised by the Jesuits, and Djalma, an Indian prince.<br /><br />Two Jesuits and a female accomplice have devised a plan to keep the Renneponts from their inheritance and to claim it for the The Society of Jesus. They hope to obtain the fortune to secure their futures and pay for the rehabilitation of the Order.<br />The story moves from one cliffhanger to another throughout the book as the struggle between the family and the two Jesuits unfolds. The Perils of Pauline and A Series of Unfortunate Events come to mind as contemporary stories with similar plot devices. This structure is a byproduct of the newspaper serialization. However, Eugene Sue is a master of his craft and he develops the various subplots with great skill. Characters are well-developed and scenes are vividly described. It is sad that this book has been out of print for so long. A new edition with a modern translation would be a great literary treat.d to Paris; Adrienne de Cardoville, a beautiful and independent-minded woman of means; Abbe Gabriel, an orphan who has been raised by the Jesuits, and Djalma, an Indian prince.<BR> <BR>Two Jesuits and a female accomplice have devised a plan to keep the Renneponts from their inheritance and to claim it for the The Society of Jesus.

She is a wonderfully real and engaging character who can see the foibles of the people around her and even has a healthy view of her own strengths and faults.<br />At the time of the events in the book she is an assistant editor and has been at the job for five years. Her original awe has been replaced by a cynicism for the trivial nature of the formulaic output of the magazine. She seeks a better life but is afraid to leave the safe comfort of the known.<br />One day she gets invited to take part in an office plot to overthrow the editor-in-chief. Her involvement in the plot takes her outside her comfortable shell and she metamorphises and grows into a whole new level of professional and personal life.<br />This is a well-crafted and tightly plotted work with great characters, lots of humor, and a light-hearted perspective on life. Vig Morgan is a bright, witty and engaging character who tells a great tale of office intrigue.	2003-10-30

Here can be seen the early development of the characters we have all grown up with.  Lynn Johnston sees humor in the struggles and problems of a married mom in the early 1980's.  The times have changed, but the problems are much the same.<br />The action is much easier to follow when it is a tight nuclear family rather than the extended four generation clan of today. Also Lynn's humor is much more on the surface as we see her struggle with what it means to be a married stay-at-home mom through the cartoon Elly and her attempts to find herself while raising two children and keeping up a home.	2003-10-12

Taking one year of Herbie's life in the east Bronx of the late 1920s, Wouk portrays the adolescent perspective of life in all its timelessness. Herbie's infatuation with Lucille Glass, his struggles with the school bully, Lenny, and his encounters with the Creek Gang are all lovingly portrayed.

By closely examining the events surrounding a case of satanic possession of a cloister of nuns in the village of Loudun, Aldous Huxley writes knowledgably and entertainingly about French history and Roman Catholicism of this period.<br />The book begins with the coming of a new priest, Urbain Grandier, to the village church. He is young, handsome,  intelligent, and sophisticated. Grandier is a worldly priest who has the village women enthralled, and he is not committed to a life of celibacy. After a series of affairs, he falls in love with and \\"marries\\" in a secret ceremony Madeleine de Brou.<br />One of the women who has become infatuated by Grandier is the Mother Superior of the Ursuline convent, Sister Jeanne des Anges, an ambitious young woman who is unstable emotionally. She starts talking of her dreams and obsessive thoughts about Grandier to  the other nuns and to her confessor. He sees the influence of the devil in these compulsive thoughts and begins an exorcism that lasts for six years.<br />Fantasies about the local priest turn into accusations that he is in league with the devil. Huxley describes Grandier' powerful enemies and their motives for wanting him punished. Grandier is accused of witchcraft, found guilty, and burned at the stake.<br />The close relationship between Sister Jeanne and her exorcist, the Jesuit mystic Joseph Surin, rounds out the book. Huxley presents a learned and intriguing discussion of christian mysticism and its relationship with the concept of satanic possession as it was understood at the time.<br />Although it is the basis for the Ken Russell movie The Devils, the book provides a much more detailed and less sensationalistic approach to the material than the movie. An excellent study that continually compares the 20th century with the topics under discussion, this book is a wonderful view into this period. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the history of France, witchcraft, mysticism, or the Catholic Church. Huxley doesn't believe in the nuns' possession, but provides a well-reasoned explanation of his own interpretation of events.mend it for anyone interested in the history of France, witchcraft, mysticism, or the Catholic Church.

One of the girls, having read a sociological study of prostitution, suggests to the others that a more structured approach is needed. So they start a business of satisfying the needs of the students at the boys school down the road. They call themselves The Syndicate, and their business they name The Passion Flower Hotel.

As the author recreates this period, slaves are animals to be bred, worked, and sold as the owners see fit. The N-word is used frequently, and slaves are represented as simple-minded and devoted to their owners. Bored by their rural life, young white men enjoy sex with their female slaves and wagering on fights between their most muscular male slaves. Slave breeding and prices are about the only things that the plantation owners seem to have enough knowledge about and interest to discuss.<br />Hammond Maxwell is 18 years old and an only child. His mother died when he was young, and his father is disabled by rheumatism. He and his father Warren are the only whites on a large Alabama plantation. Since he reached puberty he has had his choice of bedmates from the slaves of the plantation. His father is pressuring Hammond to marry his cousin Blanche who he hasn't seen since she was a baby and who lives on a distant plantation. Although Hammond has had many children by his female slaves, his father is looking for a white child who can be an heir to their plantation, Falconhurst. Blanche's father is eager to arrange a match because he is deep in debt and hopes to secure a \\"loan\\" from Hammond in exchange for his parental approval. Hammond, on his side is willing to do his duty to provide his father with progeny, but finds sex with slaves much more satisfying than with his wife. Blanche, neglected by a husband who finds more time for his pure-bred Mandingo fighter than for her, turns to drink and eventually to infidelity to ease her loneliness.<br />The plot is simplistic and the characters two-dimensional. One would hope that the author portrayed them that way intentionally rather than through lack of skill. In either case, the reader gets a glimpse into the dehumanizing effects of slavery on both the owner and the owned.

Thirty years later Robert B. Parker finishes the work left by Chandler. Parker is an accomplished mystery author himself and breathes life back into Philip Marlowe so we can follow one more case.<br />Yet Parker is not Chandler and there are places in the book where I kept feeling that he wasn't getting Marlowe just right. Probably I was looking for these non-Chandleresque moments and they are actually intriguing. Marlowe fans can read the book with this additional level of interest: did Parker capture the essence of Philip Marlowe in this scene or not?<br />All that aside this is a well-paced and entertaining mystery. There is a side plot as the book opens right after Marlowe's marriage to an heiress. The tension is between the independent and honest detective and his pampered wife who can't understand each other. He gets along better with her house boy, and she can't understand why he won't sit back and let her daddy take care of them.<br />The main plot is pure Marlowe with a sleazy pornographer/blackmailer leading a double life and mixed up in a murder. Marlowe keeps discovering bodies which puts him in trouble with the cops. Yet he can't quite figure out who is the murderer until it is almost too late.<br />If you haven't read Raymond Chandler this is not the place to start. Although this is a minor addition to the Marlowe corpus, it will be a welcome addition to those who have read the other works and desire more Marlowe. It reads quickly and never lets you down.	2003-06-15

The movie is accurate in principle, but uses artistic license to make a good story and good visual impact. The book was written by a journalist who did extensive research on the life of John Nash, a famous mathematician who developed paranoid schizophrenia. John Nash, the subject of the biography, didn't get involved in the research at all. So it is based on his written statements, and interviews with almost everyone who knew him. Sylvia Nasar has written a wonderfully detailed, yet always interesting, biography of a deeply complex man. To do this she must have interviewed hundreds of people who knew Nash. Fortunately, the author had the full cooperation of Nash's family and quotes heavily from interviews with them. Ms. Nasar is scrupulous in identifying her sources for everything in the book. The number of footnotes concerned me at first. There are over 2,000 numbered footnotes in the 45 page Notes section at the end of the book. However, these are only to identify the author's sources and seldom contain additional material. So they do not disrupt the flow of the book.<br />A Beautiful Mind is good on so many levels. It provides wonderful insight into the whole process of becoming a research faculty. It is also a great informal history of 20th century mathematical research. Although there is a some discussion of mathematical theory in the book, it is written for the general reader and should not be problematic for anyone who has an interest in math.<br />On top of that it is a great biography of a person with a difficult personality and it is a sensitive treatment of schizophrenia. All in all a delightful read if you don't get easily depressed by the tragic illness that changed this man's life.<br />This paperback edition published in 2001 contains an Epilogue that provides an update on events since the original 1998 edition appeared. As such it is preferable because of the additional information it contains.it contains.	2003-06-15

Well at 88, George Burns finds enough to be happy about to fill a book with jokes and tongue-in-cheek advice on happiness.<br />Don't read the book to find the secret of happiness because most of his advice is simplistic and written to get a laugh rather than to enlighten. However, if you like George Burns as a stand-up comic, then you should find plenty in this text to amuse you.<br />There are over 40 full-page black and white photos of George Burns with famous friends, his staff, stills from his movies and nightclub acts, and photos of him with four female models posing as either patients or nurses. These cheesecake photos are the worst part of the book.<br />At the end of the book he names all the people, including the writers and models who helped him with it. Since everything he says is a joke, you can't count on the book as a reliable memoir, so read it only for its amusement value.	2003-05-29

They love each other and are persecuted by narrow-minded people who claim their love is unnatural and sinful. This hostility forces them to bond together, to hide their true feelings, and to move from place to place. The author does a great job of presenting this relationship in the context of the 19th Century, and yet provides a deeper look into the daily lives of these women than would be possible from historic sources of the time.<br />Truly an inspiring story of the power of love and the strength that comes from a loving relationship.	2003-05-27

The Appalachian Trail was the idea of Benton MacKaye, and we are treated to his story of the beginning of the Trail in the Foreward to this book which he wrote.<br />Ronald Fisher, the author, travelled parts of the Trail starting in Georgia and ending in Maine over a six month period. His companions were Dick Durrance, a National Geographic photographer, and his wife Jill. They sampled \\"interesting portions\\" of the Trail and also explored the surrounding coutryside. So the book is not only an introduction to the Apppalachian trail, but also a splendid photographic essay of the eastern states as they were over 30 years ago. All this is done with color photos reminiscent of the National Geographic magazine, a wonderful text by the author, and eight two-page color maps of the trail.<br />The format is pretty formal. Each of the eight chapters covers a different geographic area and consists of eight pages of text, ten pages of color photos and a two-page map. The text ends with a one page Epilogue entitled \\"Before You Hike...\\" This provides some basic advice on getting started on your own exploration of the Trail. A three page Index and a list of Additional Readings completes the volume.<br />This is a wonderful, brief, and colorful introduction to the Appalachian Trail. Being more than 30 years old, I would suggest getting some more up-to-date resource guide before you start hiking. Yet for the armchair traveller, this is a delightful place to start.	2003-05-26

Written in World War II Denmark by Karen Blixen (the Isak Dinesen of Out Of Africa), it is the story of two young ladies who have lost their possessions and families. One is the forward-thinking daughter of a scientist, and the other a pampered child of the aristocracy. They bond together to protect themselves against the evils of a society corrupted by men. Yet they find themselves in the clutches of the most evil man they can imagine. I feel that Blixen wrote this book as an amusement to carry her through the horror of world war. Yet the book has a substance greater than its title and plot suggest.<br />According to one web site:<br />\\"During WW II, when Denmark was occupied by the Nazis, Karen Blixen started to write her only full-length novel, the introspective GENGÆLDELSENS VEJE (The Angelic Avengers), which was published in 1944 under the pseudonym Pierre Andr&eacute;zel. The horrors experienced by the young heroines in the novel were interpreted as an allegory of falling Nazism.\\"<br />The novel is divided into three parts. In \\"Rose-Strewn Roads And Thorny Paths,\\" we see the golden cage of the well-bred life and the perils faced by women without means. Part Two is called \\"The Canary Birds.\\" Here the young women find themselves in a position where they are like birds in a cage, fed and cared for, but helpless to control their fate. The last section of the novel is called \\"The Buried Treasure.\\" In the end, the young women confront their avenging natures and find their true treasure is their angelic ability to oppose evil with goodness and compassion.<br />The happy ending reveals the book as a parable with a clear message as to how humanity should act when faced with evil: feelings of vengeance must be overcome and replaced with compassionate love. Righteous anger will destroy not only evil in the other, but the goodness within. Another theme is how the aristocracy and the middle class differ in facing adversity. The two young women's strengths compliment each other through the book suggesting that the two classes must work together to build a just society.<br />It is a well-written and tightly scripted adventure that will keep you involved and enthralled. I highly recommend it.er theme is how the aristocracy and the middle class differ in facing adversity.

It is actually the first of a series on the effects of war and the atomic bomb on the lives of one family as seen through the eyes of a 6 year old boy, Gen Nakaoka. Based on the real-life experiences of the author, this volume opens in April 1945 and tells of the hardships of war on the people of Japan.<br />Gen's father is a craftsman in Hiroshima who makes wooden sandles to try to feed his five children and his pregnant wife. He is labelled a traitor by his neighbors because he is opposed to the war. We see the cruelties and hardships of their daily lives through the eyes of young Gen who can't understand why he and his family are despised. The close family values of his home life are in sharp contrast to the rabid patriotic chauvenism of his community. This volume ends with the events of August 6, the day of the atomic bomb. The story of how Gen survives is told in the subsequent volumes.<br />The work has been well translated from the Japanese original: Hadashi no Gen. It was originally published in serial form in 1972 and 1973 in Shukan Shonen Jampu, the largest weekly comic magazine in Japan, with a circulation of over two million. The drawings are all in black and white. This US edition was published as part of a movement to translate the book into other languages and spread around the world its message of the threat of nuclear war. It is a wonderful testimony to the strength of the human spirit and the horrors of nuclear war. There are a few introductory essays at the front of the book and a publisher's note at the end that help to put this book into perspective. It is a powerful and tragic story that I highly recommend for anyone interested in the topic.	2003-05-10

It tells the story of the day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima as seen through the eyes of seven year old Gen Nakaoka. Based on the real-life experiences of the author, Gen, his mother, and his newborn sister face the horrors of the day after the bomb. They have no food or shelter and are surrounded by the dead and dying. Even the soldiers sent in to gather and burn the dead bodies are succumbing to the radiation sickness and dying. No one understands what is happening and there is no one to turn to. Gen goes in search of food for his mother whose breast milk has dried up from malnutrition. Alone he faces the horror of the devastation and the destitution of the people of Hiroshima. This the hardest of the four books to read because the carnage of the day after the bomb is almost beyond belief. Gen's compassion, humanity, and determination makes this an inspiring book about the strength of the human spirit. Although the graphic scenes may turn some people off, this is still an important book for its message on the dangers of nuclear war.<br />The work has been wonderfully translated from the Japanese original: Hadashi no Gen.

The atom bomb has been dropped on Hiroshima, destroying most of the city, killing many people, and causing others to become sick with radiation sickness. Gen's hair is falling out from radiation exposure. He, his mother, and his newborn sister have to leave to survive. His mother can think of only one person to turn to, Kiyo, her childhood friend in the town of Eba. But the people of Eba are afraid the Hiroshima survivors have a strange contagious illness. Kiyo's family and the whole town treat them with suspicion and contempt.<br />As refugees, Gen and his mother have to find food, money, and shelter in a hostile environment. He takes a job caring for a rich man's brother who has been quarantined and left to die by the family because he has radiation sickness. Gen's compassion, humanity, and determination make this an inspiring book about the strength of the human spirit.

The book captures the complexity of Islam by looking at the world of Islam in four geographic chapters: North & West Africa, Near & Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.<br />The photographer has a great eye for color and character. He captures color in backgrounds to set off the rich detail of his pictures. The character is revealed in his portraits of the Islamic people. From children to the elderly, and even in the eyes of the women behind their veils, his camera searches for and finds the character of the people he photographs. Some of the landscapes have a graininess that detracts from their composition, but this does not detract form the overall work.<br />There is a five page Introduction by Robin Ostle that provides a general background on Islam. Also each chapter starts with a brief half-page discussion of the particular aspects of Islam in the region. Sadly, the author doesn't have a chapter on Islam in the West.<br />The book will be a welcome addition to any Islamic cultural collection. It is a visual treat for any Westerners wanting a good book that goes beyond the simple stereotypes of Islam.	2003-05-05

Born in 1885, Schauberger started life as a forester who tried to understand and copy Nature. From watching mountain streams he developed unorthodox theories based on vortex movement about water and its use. He started out designing highly efficient log flumes that used water in vortex motion and at its densest temperature of 4 degrees Centigrade. He then proposed cleaning up the Rhine River by rebuilding the natural curves which stimulate vortex motion in the water. He said that this vortex motion in the Earth caused spring water to be more alive than plain water. He believed that plants grew better in this living water and developed laboratory sized egg-shaped water energizers to activate water.<br />He also developed theories about the harmfulness of iron and steel tools in agriculture and proposed replacing them with copper ones. He designed an egg-shaped composter that was supposed to develop Noble compost which would be much more beneficial in gardens.<br />Around the Second World War his theories and experiments take a much different direction and he starts talking about Implosion energy as opposed to combustion explosion energy. He starts developing machines that generate more energy than they use and that run on water and air. Out of this research he claims to have developed a domestic power station that generates large outputs of energy from slight streams of running water. Even more fantastic is a flying saucer that used a 1/20 horsepower electric motor as a starter and then ran on the surrounding flow of air. The research on these inventions was destroyed at the end of the war. Schauberger and his son Walter never seem to have been able to find the resources to develop working models again.<br />Today his theories on vortex motion of water are taught at the Anthroposophical Emerson College in England. His copper farming tools are sold from the school his son Walter started, the Pythagoras Kepler Schule in Austria. His water, forestry, and farming theories have been accepted by Biodynamic Farming communities and may be helpful to organic farmers today.<br />There are two appendices at the end of the book by New Age science experts on the underlying theories of vortex energy. I find these actually detract from the book rather than help it. A Bibliography also is less than useful. Most of the sources are to obscure journals or original Austrian publications. These types of resources are less than helpful in such an introductory text.school his son Walter started, the Pythagoras Kepler Schule in Austria.

The images come from vintage photographs, publicity brochures, and other publications. A majority of the materials come from the collections of the University of Southern California, the Auto Club of Southern California, and Vintage Vacations (a California travel trailer restoration company). The quality of the image reproduction is excellent making this book a genuine feast for the eyes.<br />Although subtitled \\"A Visual History Of Mobile America,\\" the majority of pictures are from California with the rest of the country only sketchily represented if at all. Florida is the only other state to have more than one or two pictures included.<br />The book has eight chapters. Each begins with one page of text consisting of three paragraphs. The rest of the chapters are illustrations with captions and quotes. The first chapter \\"Motor Camping\\" has some of the earliest photos and portrays the beginnings of the travel trailer craze. The second chapter \\"Selling The dream\\" contains a collection of illustrations from brochures and advertisements. \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" the third chapter, is a collection of postcards both humorous and illustrative. The fourth chapter \\"Trailer Shows\\" contains pictures from various California trailer shows. Pictures of the latest trailer designs are often enhanced by including attractive female models. \\"Take A Look Inside\\" is the next chapter which portrays the interior furnishings of travel trailers. Again attractive female models often enhance the photos. \\"I've Got This Idea\\" is a chapter that captures some of the more inventive and original travel trailer designs. A whole chapter is devoted to \\"Trailer Logos.\\" It was in this chapter that I found the only reference to my 1948 trailer made in Alma, Michigan.<br />The book ends with a chapter on \\"Teardrops,\\" compact trailers with outdoor kitchens built into a back hatch.

Catherine Millet has written a thoughtful memoir of her sexual activities with many people over an indeterminate amount of time.<br />Predominately she is descriptive of her activities, her partners, and her thoughts and physical feelings. There are no dialogs or regrets, just a straightforward presentation. The book contains a lot of graphic description of sexual acts that may shock some readers. The author does go into quite a bit of abstract intellectual thought about meanings. This can either enhance or distract from the flow of the narrative.<br />Unlike My Life And Loves by Frank Harris, this book is not a chronological journal. It is arranged into four chapters called Numbers, Space, Confined Space, and Details. In \\"Numbers\\" Millet talks about her fondness for many physical relationships. Although she has sexual friendships and lovers, most of her encounters are with anonymous partners. \\"Space\\" is a chapter devoted to her joy in making love outdoors. \\"Confined Space,\\" on the other hand, describes her need to find privacy with her lovers in stairwells, alleys, storerooms, etc. The small intimate facts and observations on lovemaking are saved for the last chapter, \\"Details.\\"<br />What I find most interesting is how little else there is in the book to provide background or setting. Only a few locations and the first names of a few men are given. Never are dates provided which gives the work a timelessness like an erotic adult fairy tale.<br />I found out through other sources that the author was born in 1948, and has been in a monogamous marriage for over ten years. I<br />needed that much of a setting to make some sense of this work. With the current fear of AIDS and herpes, I found it difficult to imagine a person today engaging so freely in the activities described in this book, and began to think of it as an extremely well-detailed fantasy. However, when I realized that the setting for most of the material was probably the Sexual Revolution of the late 1960s and the 1970s, then I saw this book as the report of an adventurous explorer giving a meticulous account of that time and its unique morality as it worked itself out in her own life.d the 1970s, then I saw this book as the report of an adventurous explorer giving a meticulous account of that time and its unique morality as it worked itself out in her own life.	2003-04-12

In one last impulse of love, he denies to himself his great desire, Then wonder of wonders, and joy of joys, he finds that his great desire is accomplished in this very denial. This story has the happiest ending that any story could ever have, a story and an ending that can become true in the lives of every man and woman.<br />The language is a bit formal and the moral of charity to strangers is basic.

What makes the story special is that it only tells what her life is like when she is not with him. From the time he left her side until the next time she saw him she says she did nothing else but wait for him. She describes in detail her obsessive thinking about her lover. So although she never describes her time with him, all her time away from him is spent thinking about him, planning her next meeting with him, waiting for him to call, fantasizing about him. As she goes about her daily life, her mind never strays from him. It is as compelling a story as her obsession was to her.	2003-04-10

This allows the Bathroom Readers' Institute (BRI) to deliver 768 pages of little known facts, pop culture tidbits, weird news items, and intriguing origins of everyday things.<br />Articles in the text are not arranged in any particular order so an eight page Contents section at the front of the book is a great guide to your reading pleasure. Thirty three subject categories are used to group the articles which are then subdivided by length. Short articles are one page long. Medium ones are two pages. Long articles are either three or four pages, and Extended articles can run as long as eight pages. Two articles are so long they are broken into several Long parts. One on the history of Miss America is seven parts long, and the World's Tallest Buildings has eight parts.<br />Some of the articles in the book are brainteasers, puzzles, or quizzes. The answers to these are grouped together on the last eleven pages of the book.<br />There is a footnote on each page that contains an interesting fact. E.g.: On page 347 we are told that the shortest performance to win an Oscar was Anthony Quinn's 8 minutes as Gauguin in the movie Lust For Life. Every U.S. president with a beard  was a Republican is on page 399. On page 605 the note states that King Louis XV bathed just three time sin his entire life.<br />The BRI claims to gather the most interesting and little-known facts from many sources and they encourage readers to suggest additions to future volumes.

Francoise d'Orleans is an aristocratic French girl who is orphaned after losing her parents in a tragic shipwreck. When she is delivered to a forest lumber camp she is taken in and made to earn her keep by a strong-minded, practical woman who renames her Opal Whiteley.<br />The characters in the play are as Opal names them so there is The Man Who Wears Gray Neckties who falls in love with both The Girl That Has No Seeing and The Thought-Girl With The Far-Away Look In Her Eyes. Opal befriends the animals in her life and names them also. They are not physically present on the stage but are portrayed by Narrators. These include Peter Paul Rubens the pig and Felix Mendelssohn, a mouse.<br />Based on Opal's childhood diary, the story comes to life as Opal paints a picture of the people in her new-found community. The diary was originally published in the Atlantic Monthly and has since been republished as The Singing Creek Where The Willows Grow by Benjamin Hoff and as Opal, The Journal Of An Understanding Heart, by Jane Boulton.<br />The rough life of a turn of the century lumber camp in the Pacific Northwest is magically portrayed through the eyes of a mystical child.

Even though she never met her grandmother, as a member of the family, Ysenda Maxtone Graham, had access to journals, letters, and family stories that really bring life to this biography.<br />The book Mrs. Miniver began life as a series of essays that appeared in the London Times in 1938 and 1939 on the everyday life of a happily married upper-middle class woman living in London. As the war in Europe approached, these essays took on a deeper meaning describing what England was fighting to preserve and the hardships the British people were willing to endure. They were collected into the book and became a best seller in the United States. Jan Struther spent the war in the US promoting the British cause through lecture tours and radio appearances.<br />This biography shows the difference between the ideal married woman, Mrs. Miniver, and the real troubled life of Jan Struther. With loving detail, we see how she deals with a marriage that has lost its spark and a clandestine affair. In a sense this biography is a Mrs. Miniver for the 21st Century. Where the fictional Mrs. Miniver has a sexless, but loving marriage, in this book the real Jan Struther struggles with her sexual relationship with another man while she is being promoted as the ideal of British womanhood. How she resolves this complex war-time situation makes compelling reading.<br />This is a book that portrays the war years in a very human way through the life of a woman who was held up as an ideal at the time, but whose real life is a model for our generation of human frailty and the strength needed to over come it. Included are sample sections from the book Mrs. Miniver and many of Jan Struther's poems which are delightful.	2003-03-31

Their attempts to use the magic lead to many amusing adventures before they find the true value of the coin.	2003-03-21

During these past 36 years the state has moved from a land of small family farms to one dominated by industrial and technologically advanced cities. This gave Mr. Graham the idea of publishing a book of recipes of the cherished country cooking from the state's past for the NC urban dwellers of today.<br />The recipes were gathered from all over the state by NC Cooperative Extension and the NC Farm Bureau as a tribute to this great man and his contribution to the rural residents of North Carolina. The true authors are the residents of the state who submitted their favorite recipes. Jim Graham wrote the Introduction and submitted one recipe to the anthology, his mom's Brunswick Stew. Many of the entries include notes by the contributors that give them a truly personal touch. Proceeds from the book's sales go to the James A. Graham Scholars Endowment at N.C. State University.<br />If you have one North Carolina cookbook in your kitchen, this should be it. Now that the small towns of the state are hosts to fast food restaurants, and rural citizens spend hours commuting to city jobs, this book will long preserve a fading heritage for future generations. It is a labor of love to be cherished by anyone who loves North Carolina foods.	2003-03-16

Told in the first person from the photographer's point of view, we slowly see the complexities of Cuban life unfold as he becomes more involved with this woman and her life in Cuba. The contrasts between the needs of men and women in relationships and capitalism and communism are well presented. Although written during the early 1990s, the portrayal of life in Cuba and the Cuban people is still valid.	2003-03-16

Being a vegetarian, until I found this book, my experience with Cajun cooking has been limited to an occasional Red Beans and Rice. Now I am happily preparing Jambalaya, Courtbollion,and Gumbos that are vegan and low in fat.<br />Never having been pleased before with recipes for vegan cakes, I have to caution the reader that I haven't ventured into the dessert section at the back of the book. Some vegans may find the use of honey as a sweetener a problem and want to make substitutions.<br />The breakfasts, main dish and side dish recipes are wonderful, and have given me the courage to read non-vegetarian Cajun recipes with an eye as to how to adapt them to my diet.	2003-03-16

Add to this that the fictional character is Larry Sanders, a paranoid, insecure, and egotistical host of a late night talk show! Fortunately, the large print face, copious white space and 82 pages of pictures contribute to making this a quick read. The humor would be the sad type of laughing at some obnoxious, insensitive bore, except we are saved from feeling bad about this by the fact that the object of the joke is fictional. This is supposed to make laughing at him acceptable. If you can get into the premise there are plenty of funny jokes.	2003-03-11

This is a really good book to use as a main source of recipes for a vegan household. Each recipe provides calorie, fiber, sodium, protein, fat, and cholesterol analysis for people on restricted diets.

Yet I was enchanted by these 37 essays that originally appeared in the London Times between 1937 and 1939.<br />We don't even learn the first name of the lead character until the very end of the book. She is always Mrs. Miniver, and her husband is always Clem. The Minivers are close, but they don't ever act intimate.<br />Even though the essays are in the third person (except for the letter at the end where we learn her first name), this is one of the most intimate looks into a woman's mind I have ever read. The author's love of language and the details of daily life are revealed through the thoughts of this delightful character.<br />The essays were published in the Times every two weeks for the two years leading up to the British entry into World War II. Although the preparations for war are discussed in later essays, they mostly deal with the everyday lives of this typical middle class family. The essays became a symbol of the essence of British life and were published in book form as the war began. The US edition includes an additional essay where Mrs. Miniver prepares her first Christmas shopping list of the war.<br />The American cinema made an Oscar-winning movie with the same title starring Greer Garson, but the plot of the movie has nothing to do with the subject of these brief disconnected short stories. This is a wonderful book that I will cherish for a long time. Highly recommended.	2003-03-06

Starting with the initial desire to have children, and following the child-rearing process to the eventual hope of the &quot;empty nest,&quot; Cosby takes us on a humorous trip through his experiences parenting his five children. Underlying the humor is his positive approach to parenting that will be a welcome support to both fathers and mothers. He models the flexibility and sense of humor needed for successful parenting, as well as the loving closeness with both spouse and children essential to a happy family.<br />An Introduction and Afterword by a child psychiatrist points out the fatherhood essentials humorously treated by Cosby in the text.<br />I read this with Motherhood by Erma Bombeck and I can highly recommend them both to stressed-out parents looking for a grasp on parental sanity in hard times.	2003-03-01

He was no detached scientific observer in a white lab coat like Masters and Johnson. He threw himself into his work with enthusiasm. He lived the life he studied and the results of his work are in this book. But this is not just one man's report from the sexual frontier. As a disciplined reporter, he conducted countless interviews, but as a participant he was able to obtain trusting relationships. This is not Sociology; he reports on the people making money from the Sexual Revolution and their customers. It is primarily a book about men using women's sexuality to make money from other men.<br />This is not an exhaustive history but rather a look at selective people and their impact on the  times. John and Barbara Williamson's Sandstone Retreat, a sexually open community in the hills near Los Angeles, is one group that Talese focuses on. Through interviews with many of the participants he explores the effects polyamory (openly maintaining multiple sexual relationships) has on the couples who belong to this group.<br />A large portion of the book examines the publishing pioneers who, after World War II, risked fines and jail to sell erotic books and magazines in the US. The Post Office laws against sending sexual materials through the mail was the core legal restraint in the US and Anthony Comstock was the chief enforcer of this law. Some of Comstock's more famous exploits are recounted. Talese also reports on the Supreme Court, its decisions, the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, and the Nixon White House's response to the loosening sexual climate. Hugh Hefner, one of the most famous people in sexual publishing, is also studied in some detail.<br />Feminism was another revolution developing in the 1970s, but Talese only gives it passing mention. The only feminist mentioned is Betty Dodson, whose drawings of female genitalia and visits to Sandstone are discussed.<br />Talese also looks into the history of sexual expression and repression in the US. John Humphrey Noyes and the Oneida Community is looked at as a precursor to the open sexuality of the 70s. The community was built on Noyes' concepts of Perfectionism which included communal sharing that extended to sexual relationships.<br />These are just the major themes. A 20 page alphabetic Index ends the book with entries from Abortion to Emile Zola. I found the history of sexually explicit publishing most interesting. The depth of the personal interviews related to the Sandstone community was excellent. So much has changed in the past 25 years in terms of sexual expression and the sex industry.

Frank Baum the fictional Dorothy spends just four pages in Kansas with her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry before a cyclone takes her to Oz, a country of marvelous beauty. This novel explores the life of a fictional Dorothy who never escapes the harsh reality of her life in Kansas except in the world of her imagination.<br />WAS mixes a historian's dedicated search for details with a fictional story that spans a century to create a sweeping novel of the American experience. Ryman focuses on the tragedy of his characters' lives to help us understand our collective need for a fairy land like OZ where love and kindness are the rule. Using carefully researched historical details Ryman builds a truly believable but sadly horrific story of a fictional Dorothy Gael of Kansas. Placing her in such accurate settings gives incredible power to her story and the stories of those her life inspires. Drawn into the vortex of her tragedy are a mixture of real and fictional characters including L. Frank Baum (the writer of the original Oz novels), the young Judy Garland, an actor with AIDS who is compelled to play the Scarecrow, and his psychotherapist who met the elderly Dorothy just before she dies. The story takes place in the 1870s, the 1920s, the 1950s, and the 1980s. Yet these disparate plots and eras are tied together wonderfully and all given a sense of reality based on the historic research that went into the book.<br />In a postscript called Reality Check at the end of the book the writer sorts out the historic from the fictional. Here he also talks a bit about the philosophy he has toward fantasy and realism, a theme that is constantly addressed throughout the novel. This is not about Oz, except as an ideal. The novel is about the tragedy of life, and it explores why the pain of our lives makes Oz so important to us all.	2003-02-13

The first volume covered the origins of the human race through the first civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. The second volume in the series reviewed the early cultures of India and China and then moved on to discuss Greek civilization. The third volume covered the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, from 800 BCE to 600 CE. The fourth volume surveyed the rise of Islam, the Arab empires, the decline of the Byzantine Empire, and the beginnings of modern Europe. The fifth volume offered a first look at Japanese, African, and American cultures and also brings the stories of India, China, and Europe up to the 18th century. The sixth volume looked at the forces that formed the modern face of Europe and colonialism's effects on the whole world.<br />This seventh volume is focused on Europe and North America. It starts with the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution, and Urbanization. Then it explores the French and American Revolutions, the Napoleonic reforms, and the nationalist revolutions of the mid-Nineteenth Century, and ends with the US Civil War and British political reform. Sadly, the rest of the world is left out, and no mention is given to the great struggle for women's rights.<br />This is a book filled with beautiful color illustrations. Every page has at least one and most are photographs of artifacts, art works, or scenes. The text is well written and emphasizes brief summaries rather than scholarly examination. This makes it a good basic introduction and outline, but may be less useful to someone who wants to look at these subjects in greater depth. The lack of any bibliography of further readings is also a drawback for those wanting to seek more information. A two-page time chart of the period helps to put events in perspective. The chapter contents are confusingly placed at the end of the book, but they are well done and helpful for getting an overview of the author's approach. A two page listing of all the books in the series with their section and chapter titles helps to put the material into the broader view of all world history. All in all this is a great brief introduction to European and American 18th and 19th century history. However the emphasis is decidedly European and white male.<br />The type face is large and the lines are amply spaced. Couple this with the copious illustrations and the book is actually a very quick read for its size and length. It is a few steps above the approach of Dorling Kindersley books that are predominately illustrations with supporting text. With Roberts, the text is the major part, but the illustrations are definitely more than an after thought. This is a good introduction for the general reader.

I really wanted to like them, but the impression I have is of some brilliant imagery in otherwise meandering poems. Maybe I needed to understand Ukrainian culture to get more of the references, but I think most English-language readers are going to be disappointed.<br />One strange thing about the book is the use of a double period (..) to form breaks. They occur in both the Ukrainian and English translations but are never explained in the introductory material.<br />One of my favorite poems is \\"Song 551\\" that starts with the wonderful lines:<br />Before it's too late -- knock your head against the ice.<br />Before it's too late<br />Break through, look..<br />You will see a miraculous world..<br />\\"Song 352\\" contains the delightful image of \\"the poor hut of the horseradish\\" in the farthest corner of the snow-bound garden.<br />The Maiden in the play \\"Friend Li Po, Brother Tu Fu\\" sings a beautiful song:<br />Come in, my love, Oh kiss me..<br />Your kiss will change the world into heavens..<br />Come in, my love, don't be afraid of anyone,<br />Come in, my love, Oh kiss me..<br />Outside of a few few delicious moments like these, reading this poetry is more a chore than a joy. In the Foreword, George Grabowicz says that \\"Lysheha's is an elusive kind of poetry -- which may partially explain the reluctance, or inability, of critics to engage it.\\" Elusive is a good word to describe this poetry.  I can see why the critics are reluctant.<br />On the back cover of the book, the publisher quotes James Carroll who says that the poem \\"Swan\\" alone makes the book a treasure. He goes on to say that \\"Lysheha speaks through indirection...\\" which to me makes the poems difficult and tedious. Here is the beginning of \\"Swan\\":<br />My God, I'm vanishing..<br />This road won't guide me anymore..<br />I'm not so drunk..<br />Moon, don't go..<br />I appear from behind a pine -- you hide..<br />I step into shadow -- you appear..<br />I run -- already you are behind me..<br />I stop -- you're gone..<br />Only the dark pines..<br />I hide behind a trunk -- again, you're alone..<br />I am -- you are elsewhere..<br />Absent..<br />Absent..<br />I am..<br />Elsewhere..<br />I am.. absent..<br />The poem goes on in similar fashion with double periods and vague imagery for seven pages.

It is a major feminist work of the Nineteenth Century that identifies the sources of women's oppression as the church and its offspring, the state.<br />With Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Matilda Joslyn Gage was one of the three principle U.S. suffragists. Alarmed by the conservative religious movement of the time that tried to amend the Constitution to declare the U.S. a Christian state, Gage wrote this book to articulate her views that christianity was the oppressor of women.<br />In the first chapter called The Matriarchate, the author tells of the rights women had in pagan pre-christian times. She talks of the Mother-rule, that preceded Patriarchy. She then shows that christianity from its beginning has worked to undermine women's rights.<br />The following seven chapters outline the oppression of women in the west and its sources in first the church, and later in the state that developed its ruling principles from canon law. These chapters deal with Celibacy, Canon Law, Marquette (a term that Gage uses for jus primae noctis, the right of lords to the sexual favors of their peasant women), Witchcraft, Wives, Polygamy, and Work. These chapters are filled with examples from history as well as the contemporary 19th century. The documented examples of women's oppression at the hands of ministers of the church and the law in this section are an impressive collection that makes this book a valuable source for feminist herstory.<br />In the last two chapters, Gage looks at the church of her day and shows that it is still bogged down in the same dogma of women's oppression. She predicts a great revolution which will liberate women and give them equal rights with men in both religion and society. I am sure the women's movement of the 1970s with its emphasis on women's spirituality would have convinced her that she was right.	2003-01-20

It is a valuable addition to the body of literature, both fiction and nonfiction, about Oz.<br />For those who have never read an Oz book, this is still an important book. L. Frank Baum was an intriguingly different man for his times and reading about his life gives wonderful insight into America of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His feminism and respect for children and animals become some of the endearing features of his fiction and what make his Oz series classics of American literature.<br />He married Maud Gage, the daughter of Matilda Joslyn Gage, one of the leading women suffragists. So the information that Katherine Rogers provides on his relationship to his mother-in-law and his home life with Maud is invaluable to students of the women's movement. Gage's own 1893 book, WOMAN, CHURCH AND STATE, has just been brought back into print by Humanity Books in their Classics In Women's Studies series. Her belief that christianity and the Western state are the very basis of the oppression of women, which is detailed in this work, was radical at the time. Her own spirituality found a home in Theosophy which became the religious practice of Baum and was influential in his writings.<br />Baum took his family to the Dakota territory where three of Maud's siblings had settled. The book's account of their life on the northern prairie will be of interest to those who study the history of 19th century Dakota. As first a merchant and then a newspaperman, Baum's views on life in the Dakotas are well represented. It is in this section where we first encounter Baum's racism. He wrote an editorial where he called the native Americans \\"a pack of whining curs\\" who should be totally exterminated [p.259]. Rogers doesn't develop this aspect of his personality very deeply saying that for Baum these were \\"thoughtless lapses, in which Baum unthinkingly went along with contemporary attitudes [p.272].\\" Her treatment of his racism is confined to the Notes at the end of the book.<br />For those who are avid readers of Baum's fiction, the book is a wealth of information. Each of his novels are analyzed and related to the events in his life. When possible drafts are compared with completed works to gain insight into Baum's creative process. His relationships with his illustrators W. W. Denslow and John R. Neill are described. The close relationship he had with Denslow is contrasted by the distance he maintained with John R. Neill. His dispute with Denslow, who illustrated The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, over the ownership of the characters may have contributed to his reluctance to know Neill better. Baum and Neill only met once. He relating to Neill mostly through the publisher, which accounts for some of the mistakes that exist between Baum's descriptions and Neill's pictures.<br />The book contains 35 pages of Notes, many of them long and detailed additions to the text. A six page listing of Baum's published works will be a joy to collectors. The 13-page index makes it easy to find any details quickly in the text. This is a wonderful work with a positive perspective on Baum, his writings, and the time in which he lived.personality very deeply saying that for Baum these were \\"thoughtless lapses, in which Baum unthinkingly went along with contemporary attitudes [p.272].\\" Her treatment of his racism is confined to the Notes at the end of the book.<br />For those who are avid readers of Baum's fiction, the book is a wealth of information.

In fifty five hilarious chapters, Armour has written a very funny parody of an American History textbook complete with Test Questions, Mid-Term Projects, and a Glossary of Terms.  It covers the period from Christopher Columbus to Gerald Ford. Too bad he stopped updating the book and missed the opportunity to chronicle the comic adventures of Reagan, Clinton, and the Bushes. Fortunately, our generation has Larry Gonick's Cartoon Histories which are the closest modern writings that compare to this book. Armour's style is based upon puns at which he is a master. Like Gonick, he is a Ph.D. scholar. While Gonick was a scientist, Armour got his Ph. D. from Harvard and is an historian. His approach is humorous but is well grounded. Take a look at this satiric commentary on the classic American textbook and enjoy a good laugh.	2002-12-19

On the day of their wedding in 1755 in Nova Scotia, all the French men are summoned together by the commander of the British troops. They are told that all their lands, dwellings, and animals are forfeited to the crown and that they will be transported to other lands. The villages and farms are burned. The people are loaded onto ships. Evangeline and Gabriel are separated onto different ships. They are scattered throughout the continent in what is called by French Canadians \\"le grand derangement.\\" Evangeline searches endlessly for Gabriel hoping to renew their lives together. The history is true; the lovers are legendary. This monstrous crime of history is brought to life wonderfully by relating it through the lives of separated young lovers.<br />The poem is written in unrhymed hexameter which gives it a timeless appeal. It almost reads like a short story rather than a 19th century poem. I got interested in this story after visiting Nova Scotia this summer and meeting the French Canadians who live there. After learning their sad history, I wanted to read this book.<br />This edition has a 31 page Introduction by C. Bruce Ferguson that recounts the historic events portrayed and the story of how Longfellow came to write about them.  It also explores the historicity of the main characters who have become legends on their own. There are 12 pages of black and white illustrations from books and movies which help to bring the setting and characters to life. This is a wonderful edition of a classic of American literature and is highly recommended.	2002-12-19

Only one English language collection of Zola's short stories has been available prior to the publication of FOR A NIGHT OF LOVE. Ths is a set of 16 stories published by Oxford University Press under the title The Attack On The Mill And Other Stories.<br />This current collection brings together three stories that the editors claim have never before been published in English. All three have a romantic theme.<br />The first, For A Night Of Love, tells the story of a shy young postal worker who falls in love with his beautiful, rich, and haughty neighbor. She ignores him until one night when she needs his help. The story tells how far he will go for a night of love.<br />The second tale is of a young man, Nantas, who comes to Paris to make his fortune and falls in love with his landlord's daughter. She needs a favor from him, but disdains his love. He goes to extraordinary lengths to win her love, but will he succeed?<br />These two stories of male desire are followed by Fasting, a story in which Zola takes one of his pokes at the Catholic clergy. It portrays a rich woman's sexual daydreams as she sits in church listening to a sermon on fasting given by a gourmet priest .<br />All three stories are excellent at portraying 19th Century France and the people of this time. It is our good fortune that these three are now available in the English language. The Foreward gives some insight into Zola's writings and the Introduction some background on the stories. A good collection of stories from one of France's greatest writiers.	2002-12-09

It is difficult for a biographer to weave together an honest look at such a person without their cooperation. Yet Howard Sounes does a great job of looking past the image and providing his readers with a glimpse of the person behind the legend. Without being able to interview the man himself, he uses Dylan's words from past interviews, legal records, and interviews with friends and associates to piece together a picture of the life behind the legend.<br />Telling the story of Dylan from birth to the year 2000, this book focuses on the details of a life devoted to a musical career. I found particularly interesting the section on Dylan's musical roots in Hibbing, Duluth, and Minneapolis. Also, interviews with some of the few people Dylan befriended over the years give us a wonderful peak at his human side. Finally, producers and musicians tell fascinating stories about recording sessions that add to our understanding of the music on his CDs. The author has interviewed many people who had contact with Dylan through the years so we get much detail, but ultimately are still only on the outside looking in. Usually Sounes takes the high road and refrains from telling salacious details.<br />The book will appeal to devoted fans who love Dylan's music and want to know about the person behind it. If you are new to Bob Dylan and want to understand his cultural impact, this is not the book for you. It is also a very revealing study of the isolating effect that fame can have on people.	2002-11-30

The French Revolution is one of the most significant events in world history. So much has been written about it that it can be difficult to find a good place to start exploring the subject. Well, look no more. William Doyle has written a terrific introduction to the topic that is wonderful in its scope and yet concise. In this book he is more concerned with why the French Revolution mattered and has continued to matter, that with a retelling of what happened.<br />Rather than a strict chronological approach, the six chapters of this book give the reader six different perspectives on the same event. Each adds depth to our understanding of the event and its place in history.<br />Chapter one is called \\"Echoes\\" and it relates how this great upheaval was perceived by the rest of the world not only in the newspapers of the day but in fiction and drama. The Importance of Being Earnest, A Tale of Two Cities, and The Scarlet Pimpernel are discussed. The complete text of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens is included in this chapter as well.<br />\\"Why It Happened\\" is the second chapter. Here the author discusses the causes of the Revolution. This is mainly a description of the Ancien Regime's government and society during the reign of Louis XVI.<br />The third chapter is called \\"How It Happened.\\" In this chapter Doyle discusses the Revolution as a series of events that stretched over a number of years. He does an excellent job of showing how each event led to the next. The violent excesses of the guillotine are much more understandable in context.<br />\\"What It Ended\\" is the name of the fourth chapter and my personal favorite. It is here that we see the impact that the Revolution had, not only in France, but throughout the world. Before the Revolution there is a world of Divine Right, religious authority, slavery, peasants, and aristocracy. While this doesn't change overnight, the fact that the people can revolt and change the social order becomes established beyond a doubt. Once changed, society seems unwilling to go back and is changed forever.<br />The next to the last chapter is called \\"What It Started,\\" and it deals with the effects the Revolution has had on the world. It also discusses the reaction to the Revolution and the dynamic tension of radical and conservative forces in modern history.<br />\\"Where It Stands\\" is the last chapter. This is devoted to the schools of academic thought on the Revolution. The \\"classic\\" interpretation of the Revolution and its critics are outlined with a brief history. The chapter ends with an outline of contemporary thinking about the Revolution.<br />The book ends with a Timeline, The Revolutionary Calendar, a list of Further Readings, and an Index. The Calendar of twelve 30-day months and five complimentary days that began on September 22, 1793 is especially interesting.<br />This is a great introduction into the events and meaning of the French Revolution. It will satisfy the reader who wants just one book on the topic as well as the beginning scholar who is looking for a place to start his or her research.shed beyond a doubt.

In this book he teams up with sex educator Christine DeVault. The combination produces a good introductory text on sexuality that is lots of fun to read.<br />Narrated by a cartoon Mother Nature and a cartoon fairy called The Etiquette Elf, the book covers reproductive biology, sexual anatomy, developmental biology, gender roles, gender identity, interpersonal communication about sex, romantic love, the sexual act, birth control, health issues, STDs, non-consensual sex, and sexual function problems. All of this is done in delightful cartoons that are clear yet not overly explicit. Although the book is cartoon in format, the information provided is professional at an introductory level. The end of the book contains two pages of further readings, a list of journals devoted to sexuality, and eight resource organizations. An index allows you to find just what you need when you need it.<br />This is a valuable addition to the library of anyone who is sexually active or has plans to become so. Readers who expect Gonick's humor to dominate this book may be disappointed, but people who are looking for a good introductory sex manual will be overjoyed.	2002-11-22

The first volume covered the origins of the human race through the first civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. The second volume in the series reviewed the early cultures of India and China and then moved on to discuss Greek civilization. The third volume covered the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, from 800 BCE to 600 CE. The fourth volume surveyed the rise of Islam, the Arab empires, the decline of the Byzantine Empire, and the beginnings of modern Europe. The fifth volume offered a first look at Japanese, African, and American cultures and also brings the stories of India, China, and Europe up to the 18th century. This sixth volume takes a closer look at European history. It covers the forces that formed the modern face of Europe and takes a detailed look at colonialism's effects on the whole world.<br />This is a book filled with beautiful color illustrations. Every page has at least one and most are photographs of artifacts, art works, or scenes. The text is well written and emphasizes brief summaries rather than scholarly examination. This makes it a good basic introduction and outline, but may be less useful to someone who wants to look at these subjects in greater depth. The lack of any bibliography of further readings is also a drawback for those wanting to seek more information. A two-page time chart of the period helps to put events in perspective. The chapter contents are confusingly placed at the end of the book, but they are well done and helpful for getting an overview of the author's approach. A two page listing of all the books in the series with their section and chapter titles helps to put the material into the broader view of all world history.<br />A chapter on Authority and its Challengers talks about the evolving power of kings and popes. It goes on to describe the Protestant Reformation and the Counter-Reformation.The chapter ends with a discussion on consolidation of state power and civil unrest. Another chapter is devoted to the new great powers of Europe: France, the Habsburgs, Russia, and Prussia.  Then the second half of the book tells the tale of imperialism and colonialism. The struggles between the colonial powers of Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and Great Britain are described. The formation of the English empire through naval success and the effects of colonialism on both Europe and the colonial countries ends this volume. All in all this is a great brief introduction to modern European history and the colonial period in world history. Although the emphasis is decidedly European, the coverage is global.<br />The type face is large and the lines are amply spaced. Couple this with the copious illustrations and the book is actually a very quick read for its size and length. It is a few steps above the approach of Dorling Kindersley books that are predominately illustrations with supporting text. With Roberts, the text is the major part, but the illustrations are definitely more than an after thought. This is a good introduction for the general reader. It is not going to be a lasting reference book that you will turn to again and again.nds with a discussion on consolidation of state power and civil unrest.

It is his longest book and deals with the transformative power of Truth, Justice, and Love. It also deals with how social change happens slowly through generational change rather than by changing<br />the minds of individuals. It is the story of a teacher in a small French town fighting to prove the innocence of his fellow teacher, a Jew, who is accused of killing a child. The defenders of the teacher have to fight anti-Semitism in the Catholic Church, the government, and the press. Written after Zola's return from exile in England for his part in the Dreyfus Affair, the book draws much of its plot from his experiences fighting anti-Semitism. It is a powerful work that shows how anti-Semitism was used by the different factions in 19th CenturyFrance for their own ends.<br />This is Zola's third anti-clerical work and his strongest. The first two are LOURDES and ROME which deal with a priest's growing disillusion with his church. In TRUTH, the teacher knows that the real murderer is a Christian brother in the local Catholic school who is protected by the local priests. He has to expose the corruption in the church to prove the innocence of his friend. This plot has special relevance to Americans today who are struggling with stories of priests who molested young boys and a Catholic church that protected the priests rather than the children. In the preface written a hundred years ago, the translator states that this abuse by a cleric of a young boy \\"is not to be regarded as altogether exceptional\\" since many such crimes are hushed up by friends in the church.<br />The structure of the novel is well thought out and is composed of four books of four chapters each. Although narrated in the third person, the book is mostly told from the point of view of the teacher. This lack of objectivity is the weakest part of the novel because we only get to see the teacher's opponents through his limited and biased view. The book is Utopian in style with Truth conquering deceit and leading to a more perfect social structure.ew.

He got his job 20 years earlier on the basis of two successful novels. The deadly routine of academic life, however, has drained him of any remaining creative ability. Now, as his own daughter has left home to go to college, he becomes infatuated with the creative talent of Angela Argo, a pierced and tatooed student, who he feels has a rare gift for writing. While the campus struggles with the concept of sexual harrassment between students and their teachers, we follow the thoughts of Professor Swenson as he and Angela interact in a drama that could ruin his family and his career. The point of view approach makes the story intriguing to read as we see the events play out in Ted's mind. However, the ending is limited by his own developing understanding of what has actually happened to him. Francine Prose is excellent at portraying the world as seen through the eyes of a middle aged married man going through a mid-life crisis.	2002-10-10

I picked up this book to get past that. It is a brief introduction to European and Japanese fascism that covers the basic history, philosophy, and politics of fascism in the 20th century. The stark black-and-white illustrations by Litza Jansz bring the book to life and are well integrated into Stuart Hood's text. The book covers the origins of fascism in the 19th century through to the re-emergence of neo-fascism at the dawn of the 21st century.

I read this book because the author writes about his experience before and during the Holocaust. he comes from the city of Mukachevo in western Ukraine. My parents are from this region and I have a strong interest in this area and its people. His description of Jewish life in this area before the war is wonderful. This is also a well-told and powerful Holocaust memoir. He and his six siblings miraculously all survived the death camps of Auschwitz.<br />The majority of the book, however, is about his post-Holocaust experiences and his family life up to 1983. He was a moderately successful businessman in the United States who was involved in partnerships with his brothers. He talks about his wife and four children and his business successes and failures. These are hardly memorable topics. However, he brings such a sincere and ethical perspective to his story and makes these simple things of daily life interesting to read about. As a non-Jew, I find this book a wonderful outline of the positive ethical values of the Jewish religion as revealed in the life of one Jewish family.	2002-09-25

The main body of the work are 78 entries arranged alphabetically from \\"Advertising\\" to \\"White Chocolate.\\"  Cross-references to other entries in the book are marked with asterisks.<br />A three page \\"Orientation\\" at the beginning of the book provides a guide for reading the entries thematically. It divides the entries into three broad categories. The first is \\"From Legend To History\\" which follows chocolate in 25 entries from its origins with the Aztecs, through a country-by-country tour of Europe, to some of the famous chocolate manufacturers. The second category is \\"Chocolate In All Its Forms.\\" This section follows chocolate in 26 entries from its origin as the fruit of the cacao tree , through its harvesting and manufacturing processes, to the many finished products containing chocolate. The last section of the Orientation is called \\"A World Of Pleasures\\" which outlines the delights of eating chocolate.<br />The Orientation is followed by a 20 page essay called \\"The Story of Chocolate\\" which discusses each of the sections in the Orientation. This essay is followed by the 78 alphabetical entries. The end of the book has a chocolate chronology, a short Selected Bibliography, and an Index. Almost every page of the book has color illustrations, most of which are either full- or half-page in size.<br />This is a delightful introduction to chocolatology. It is surprisingly informative for such a small book.  It sacrifices depth of coverage for many brief and informative essays on a wide variety of topics. Look elsewhere for a cookbook; there is not one recipe in this book.	2002-07-22

This is a truly beautiful book with 12 color plates and nearly 100 black-and-white drawings by John R. Neill, the famous illustrator of almost all the Oz books.<br />Rinkitink is the fat, lazy, and irresponsible king of the small kingdom of Rinkitink which lies on the shore of Baum's imaginary Nonestic Ocean. He is too lazy to walk any great distance and keeps a surly saddled goat named Bilbil near him always to provide him with transportation. His redeeming qualities are his jovial nature, his great love of life, and his ability to burst into spontaneous laughter or song. The story of the book mainly takes place on islands in the Nonestic Ocean and begins when Rinkitink, tired of the responsibilities of ruling, sneaks away without telling anyone where he is going. He visits Pingaree where Prince Inga is a quiet boy who spends much of his time reading books in a tree.<br />Pingaree is a rich kingdom and is attacked by marauders soon after Rinkitink arrives. They loot and sack the island taking all the islanders back to their own islands of Regos and Coregos as slaves. Prince Inga, Rinkitink, and Bilbil are overlooked and left stranded on Pingaree. How can a lazy overweight king, a shy boy, and a surly goat  rescue the Pingareeans? This is the drama of Rinkitink in Oz.<br />The characters are among the best developed in any of Baum's work. The plot is tight and exciting. Danger and force are confronted with a charming grace that marks Baum's best works. Also, this is my favorite Oz book to read aloud. Rinkitink's joviality, laughter and songs are great for recitation.<br />The title of the book may be a bit misleading because Oz is not even mentioned until the last five chapters of this 24 chapter book. According to the Afterword by Peter Glassman, Rinkitink was originally written in 1905, 11 years before it was published. Other commitments and illness prevented Baum from writing a book in 1916. So he took the unpublished Rinkitink and reworked the ending to bring Dorothy and the Wizard, as well as a brief visit to Oz, into the plot. Although this sudden shift is the weakest part of the book, loyal Oz fans will not mind once Ozma throws one of her famous banquets for Rinkitink and Inga. This is also a good book for readers not familiar with the Oz series since it stands on its own more than most of the other books in the series.ented Baum from writing a book in 1916.

It is unique in not only portraying the history of the Ukrainian people but also includes the other peoples who live or have lived in the land now known as Ukraine.<br />The organization of the book is chronological with 49 chapters divided into ten parts. Each part covers a significant period in Ukrainian history: Pre-Kievan Times; the Kievan Period; the Lithuanian-Polish Period; the Cossack State; the Hetmanate; Ukraine in the Russian Empire; Ukraine in the Austrian Empire; World War I; the Interwar Years; and, World War II &amp; the Postwar Years.  Forty-two black-and-white maps help illustrate the concepts described in the text. Also included are thirty-six textual inserts which provide lengthy quotes of important documents. Sometimes these feel redundant because the author has described so well the events highlighted by the inserted texts.<br />For readers to whom 700 pages of Ukrainian history is not enough and who want to learn more about specific events or periods described in this book, Magocsi provides a forty page bibliographic essay called: For Further Reading. One of the great stumbling blocks for English-speaking readers who want to learn Ukrainian history is the fact that so many Ukrainian sources have not been translated. A great feature of this bibliography is that the vast majority of the works listed are in English.<br />Ukrainian history is complex. This book, although daunting to read because of its size and depth of coverage, can help the student of Ukrainian history untangle the puzzles of Ukraine and its people. It is a great reference work that belongs in the library of anyone interested in the subject.	2002-07-15

Books	5	9	9	N	N	Marvelous Depression-era coming of age story	This is an engaging tale of a young man coming of age in the 1930s US Depression. Tom is a sheltered youth working on his uncle's Wisconsin farm when his uncle dies and he must return to his father's farm in Texas. Pete, one of the farm hands, suggests that they could get to Texas together on the $33 that Tom has. Tom and Pete join an army of out of work drifters crisscrossing the land, working at odd jobs for their meals and sleeping under the stars. Tom loses Pete along the way and falls in love with Lucy, a young runaway girl, only to lose her too.<br />Radcliffe Squires in his 1964 book, FREDERIC PROKOSCH, says, \\"Night of the Poor aims at combining a story of an innocent youth's experience with an allegory of America rendered bitter and aimless by the economic depression of the 1930's.\\" Mr. Squires goes on to say \\"the boy's groping toward maturity and understanding embodies the notion of youthful America which now must also put aside pioneer frontiers like childish things and grow up.\\"  This is an excellent summation of the novel. Sadly there is not much criticism available of Prokosch novels. Squires is the only person to write a book about the author and he calls this book, I think very undeservedly, one of Prokosch's poorest novels. It deserves a second reading by American readers.<br />Written at the end of the Depression on the eve of the US entry into World War II, the novel portrays the devastating effects of the Depression on the US. All along the way Tom finds people down on their luck and without resources, pushed to the limits of their endurance. The people are the strange refuse of a society cut to the bone by poverty. Fortunately, the author is able to capture the generous and loving spirit of the American people even at their darkest hour. Yet this is no fairy tale America. Along the way the boy witnesses a murder, a rape, and a lynching. Prokosch hints at a new nation being born out of this painful period. His image of a nation coming to maturity as revealed through the maturing vision of a youthful innocent takes on a mystical and dream-like quality.<br />Possibly the people of the time were too close to the reality of the events to appreciate this work. Possibly on the eve of war with Germany, the US was turning its back on a writer of German heritage. Whatever the reasons the novel didn't succeed when first published, it is today an insightful look at a country caught between the Depression of the 1930s and the World War of the 1940s.as revealed through the maturing vision of a youthful innocent takes on a mystical and dream-like quality. <br />Possibly the people of the time were too close to the reality of the events to appreciate this work.

This novel, The Agony Column, was written by him ten years before his first Charley Chan novel. It might be considered a romance and it might be considered a mystery. It tells the story of a young couple falling in love, but it also contains the tale of a most mysterious murder.<br />The time is July 1914 and the setting is London. Rumors of a European war are in the press, but the two main characters are Americans who both enjoy reading in the newspaper the Personal Notices, popularly known as The Agony Column. In it are published the personal messages of otherwise reserved British urbanites.<br />As the novel begins Geoffrey West is having his breakfast in a restaurant and reading the Agony Column when he sees a beautiful young woman enter with her father. He is immediately attracted to her and notices that she too carries the Agony Column in her hand. The waiter seats the young lady and her escort at the table next to West and he hears her express her enjoyment of the ads in the personals. His breakfast over, West leaves the restaurant but can't get this young woman out of his mind. How can he meet her? He doesn't even know who she is. Then it hits him. He writes to her in the Personal Notices. In her reply she asks that he write seven letters to her in seven days to prove he is an interesting person and tells him how to post them. His first letter is innocent enough, but then the mystery begins. Murder and political intrigue are detailed in the letters of a man smitten by love. The two questions of \\"who done it?\\" and \\"will the boy get the girl?\\" drive the plot along. This is a delightful tale that will entertain to the very end.<br />This novel was made into a movie in 1930 called The Second Floor Mystery, starring Loretta Young as the beautiful young lady.

The first volume covered the origins of the human race through the first civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. The second volume in the series reviewed the early cultures of India and China and then moved on to discuss Greek civilization. The third volume covered the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, from 800 BCE to 600 CE. The fourth volume surveyed the rise of Islam, the Arab empires, the decline of the Byzentine Empire, and the beginnings of modern Europe. This fifth volume gives us a first look at Japanese, African, and American cultures. It also brings the stories of India, China, and Europe, begun in earlier volumes, up to the 18th century.<br /><br />The book is filled with beautiful color illustrations. Every page has at least one and most are photographs of artifacts, art works, or scenes. The text is well written and emphasizes brief summaries rather than scholarly examination. This makes it a good basic introduction and outline, but may be less useful to someone who wants to look at these subjects in greater depth. The lack of any bibliography of further readings is also a drawback for those wanting to seek more information. A two-page time chart of the period helps to put events in perspective. The chapter contents are confusingly placed at the end of the book, but they are well done and helpful for getting an overview of the author's approach. A two page listing of all the books in the series with their section and chapter titles helps to put the material into the broader view of all world history.<br />The chapters on India and China pick up the thread of the story begun in Volume 2 of the series and bring both histories up to the 17th Century. One chapter is devoted to Japanese history up to the 17th Century. Another chapter briefly outlines African and American cultures. Then the second half of the book is devoted to European history from the \\"Middle Ages\\" through the 16th Century. All in all this is a great brief introduction to the first half of the second millennium. Although the emphasis is decidely European, the coverage is global, at least as far as major civilizations are concerned.<br />The type face is large and the lines are amply spaced. Couple this with the copious illustrations and the book is actually a very quick read for its size and length. It is a few steps above the approach of Dorling Kindersley books that are predominately illustrations with supporting text. With Roberts, the text is the major part, but the illustrations are definitely more than an after thought. This is a good introduction for the general reader.

It is an exciting story of strength and determination in the face of overwhelming opposition.<br />In 1925 Maria Savchyn was born in a Ukrainian village east of the city of Lviv. At that time this was a part of Poland. Ukrainians living in this part of Poland formed the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) to seek independence from Poland, but in 1939 the partition of Poland put Western Ukraine under Soviet control. The OUN continued their activities for independence during this early Soviet occupation, and they formed the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) when the Nazis gained control early in World War II.Fighting first against the Nazis and then the Russians until the mid-1950s, the UPA resisted the occupation forces and fought for an independent Ukraine 50 years before the country actually gained its independence in 1991.<br />Maria joined the youth division of the OUN in 1940 when she was 14. Later she married a prominent leader of the group. She was an active member until 1954 when she was captured by the KGB. Involved in propaganda, Maria talks more about the day-to-day life of the underground than armed resistance. She gives a remarkably detailed account of her life in the UPA. This includes the names of the towns and villages she stayed in and the names of the people she worked with in the underground.<br />Its a sad story to read since during the period covered most of her fellow rebels were either captured or killed. Maria herself lost both her children to stay with the rebels. For the last nine years of the resistance she and her allies spent every winter in underground bunkers which were cramped, moist, and dark.<br />Yet for anyone interested in Ukrainian history or in resistance movements this is essential reading. Few members of the UPA have lived to tell their stories so Maria's book opens the door on a chapter of history long hidden from view. This is, however, not a history of the OUN and the UPA. That book remains to be written and will probably require access to KGB records.<br />I only wish this book came with a map that detailed the region and the villages mentioned in the text. Most English-language readers will not have sufficient geographic knowledge of the region to follow Maria's exploits without a good map.to tell their stories so Maria's book opens the door on a chapter of history long hidden from view.

Readers who are familiar with the works of L. Frank Baum will recognize these two characters from two previous novels that are set outside of Oz, The Sea Fairies and Sky Island. While it is not necessary to have read these two works prior to reading this book, the three novels taken together outline the close relationship of this optimistic and courageous young girl and her pragmatic companion, the worldly retired sailor who lost his leg at sea.<br />The plot is familiar to readers of other Oz books. Mortals from the outside world get hopelessly lost, but retaining their determination and good will, they move forward until they find themselves in the fairy land of Oz. All along the way Trot and Cap'n Bill meet fantastic beings and explore strange countries which the author creates with a joy and imagination that seem boundless. On this trip they meet and become fast friends with a strange flying creature called the Ork, who, although featherless, is equipped with a propeller as well as four wings. Together the three of them continue on to the Land of Mo where they inexplicably come across another beloved Baum character, Button-Bright, a boy who is unflappable and prone to getting lost. These four next find themselves in a remote and inaccessible corner of the land of Oz called Jinxland. Here they fall victim to the cruel plots of King Krewl and the magic spells of the witch Blinkie. Discovering their plight, the Scarecrow of Oz decides to go to their rescue.

Yet this book uses them well to show the role the penis has played in the development of western culture. The book is a cultural history of the penis, and explores human (mostly men's) thinking about the male reproductive organs.<br />The first chapter, The Demon Rod, explores the moral view of the penis as it developed from ancient times through Christianized Western European thought. Is the penis a gift of the gods or man's link with the devil? This is the question that is explored in this chapter. From the  phallic cults of ancient Sumer, Egypt, Greece and Rome, through the Jewish circumcision pact, to the demonization of the penis by Christian thinkers like Augustine, the role of the penis in the relationship of man to his god is explored.<br />Chapter Two, The Gear Shift, starts with Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical dissections and examines the early attempts of western science to discover the biological rather than the mythical aspects of the penis. The period covered is the 16th through the 19th century. Most of the science, though well-intentioned, is colored by the moral thinking of the time. Although much is learned, many false theories coexist with newly discovered anatomical facts.<br />The next chapter is called The Measuring Stick and is a look at the theories surrounding Racism and penis size. It outlines the history of the belief that males of African heritage have greater penile size than any other race. From Noah to Mapplethorp, the fascination and fear associated with this concept and the racial theories that developed along side it are well laid out.<br />The Cigar is Chapter Four and it explores the influence of the penis on Freud and psychoanalytical thought. Here we move from the physical manifestation of the penis to its effects on the psyche, both in the individual and the culture. With quotes from Freud's writings, we see his development of the theories of the Oedipus Complex and the vaginal orgasm, and their effects on modern society.<br />Chapter Five, entitled The Battering Ram, is a look at the feminist reaction of the 1960s to the Freudian emphasis on the penis and vaginal orgasm. These feminist thinkers shift the focus to the clitoris as the center of satisfying sexual relationships for women. From Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique to Andrea Dworkin's Pornography, the link between the penis and sexual violence in feminist writings is outlined in wonderful detail.<br />The final chapter, The Punctureproof Balloon returns to the physiological study of the penis that started in chapter two. However, this chapter picks up with the 19th Century with its quacks and misinformed physicians and takes us up to the present day's modern medical marvels. Here we see urologists taking the study of impotence away from psychoanalysts and developing medical treatments. This is a wonderful historic outline of the creation and cultural impact of Viagra and other pharmaceutical treatments for Erectile Dysfunction.<br />All in all this is a fascinating popular treatment of a topic that tends to either not be discussed or is discussed so informally as to have little regard for the facts. This book tells it all and backs up the facts with 35 pages of Notes to the bibliographic sources. To help the reader find the facts a 12 page Index ends the book.

The memories take place in the period just before, during and after the First World War. Her family came from the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. She calls them \\"Pod Karpacki Rus\\", but they are now known as Ruthenians, or Rusyns. The stories are told from a child's point of view. We see things as young Ann sees them growing up in a house full of male boarders who were all born and raised in a far off land. The stories show how she changes as she goes to school with native-born Americans and quickly becomes more adjusted to life in this country than her parents' generation. As the book progresses her pride in her family becomes mixed with embarrassment at their language and behavior. Rusyn phrases are scattered throughout the book, and at the end of the book there are eleven pages of Rusyn recipes.  This is a delightful book that will be enjoyed by anyone whose grandparents or great-grandparents came from the Carpathian Mountains. It will also be of interest to people studying the social life and customs of immigrant communities in the early 20th century.	2002-05-01

Frank Baum (Books of Wonder edition)<br />Tik-Tok of Oz is a delightful book with an interesting story of how it came to be. A small Editor's Note by Peter Glassman on page 10 of this book tells the story. There had been two successful stage plays based on the first two Oz books and Baum wanted to write a play based on the third, Ozma of Oz. However, he found out he couldn't use many of the characters because he had already sold the stage rights to them. He took the plot of the third book and changed Dorothy and Ozma into two new characters Betsy Bobbin and Queen Ann Soforth. Then he used the popular Shaggy Man who was introduced in The Road to Oz and changed many of the incidents in the story to create a new script for the stage that he called The Tik-Tok Man of Oz. The play was a success so he then rewrote it into this novel.<br />If you have read Ozma of Oz, you will indeed see the similarities. Once again an army of one soldier and many officers is led by a girl leader in an attack against the Nome King. This time it is Queen Ann Soforth from the smallest and poorest kingdom in Oz. She is young and tired of her tiny kingdom and wants to seek adventure. When her sister jokingly suggests that Ann raise an army and conquer Oz, Ann likes the idea. She convinces all but one of the eighteen men of her kingdom to join her army and they set out. However, the sorceress Glinda, learns of her plans and magically transports Ann and her army across the Deadly Desert and out of Oz entirely.<br />Meanwhile Betsy Bobbin, like Dorothy in Ozma of Oz, is lost at sea in a storm with her companion Hank the Mule. They are cast up on shore of the Rose Kingdom where they meet up with the Rose Princess, the Shaggy Man and Polychrome, the Rainbow's daughter. This group goes on a quest with the Shaggy Man who is seeking his lost brother, a prisoner of the Nome King. They meet up with Queen Ann's army and Tik-Tok. This large group decides to go in search of the Nome King together.<br />Their quest leads them to the fairy kingdom of the great Jinjin, Tititi-Hoochoo where they meet a young dragon named Quox. Their encounter with the Nome King is terribly amusing and their search for the Shaggy Man's brother has a remarkable outcome.<br />What starts out as a reworking of another story takes on a life of its own to become an entertaining and amusing story.

It is said that the author based his character on a genuine Chinese detective in Honolulu named Chang Apana that he read about while vacationing in Honolulu. In a time when \\"white priviledge\\" was assumed, Detective Chan overcomes racial barriers as he pursues white murderers in a white society. The only other Chinese in evidence in these stories are servants and laborers. The novels take place in the Honolulu and California of post World War I America and the descriptions of these long-gone settings are wonderfully rich and rewarding. Each story not only tells how a puzzling murder is solved, but also has a sub-plot of young people finding true love. Romance, historic settings, race relations, and a murder mystery are all the earmarks of a Charley Chan novel. They are a joy to read and much better than the movies of the 1930s and 1940s. I am disappointed that the book has only five of the six Charley Chan novels. Included in this volume are: The House Without a Key (1925); The Chinese Parrot (1926); Behind That Curtain (1928); The Black Camel (1929); and, Keeper of the Keys (1932). The one novel left out is: Charlie Chan Carries On (1930). I hope that someday we will be able to buy all six in one volume with an introductory essay that gives some background on the author and discusses the influence of these novels.	2002-04-19

Illustrated by Sulamith Wulfing; text by Hans Christian Andersen. Translated from the German by Petra Michel.<br />Sulamith Wulfing is a fantastic artist whose work has been sold as books of plates, calendars, and even decks of cards. This book is special because it is one of the few times that her works illustrate a story. Each page has black and white line drawings and there are ten full page color plates. The color plates are the type of work for which the artist is most known and the ten in this book have been reprinted in her calendars and other collected works. The color is vibrant and the themes of each are sublime.  The cover illustration is also the last illustration in the text and shows the mermaid transformed into The Immortal Soul.<br />An epilog called \\"The Sacrifice\\" written by the artist's son, Otto Schulze, states that a new translation of Andersen's story was used and that \\"parts of the story have been summarized.\\" While staying true to Andersen's original plot, incidents and characters have been left out and parts of the story have been changed. These changes raise the story above being a children's fairy tale and highlight its allegorical theme about the role of love in the quest for immortality. The modified text and the mystical art go together excellently to make this the best rendering of this story I have ever seen. Originally published in German in 1953, this work is as vibrant today as when it was first conceived 50 years ago.<br />At the end of the book is a brief one page biography of the author with an early photograph of her and a self portrait painted in 1953.	2002-04-18

It is easy to read yet fully detailed about the major topics of this small but complex area of study. The author is the leading expert on Rusyn history and culture and this is his beginner's guide to this topic. The text is illustrated throughout with black-and white photographs, artwork, and maps and there is an eight page insert of color plates called \\"The Seasons of the Church\\" that illustrates the liturgical uniqueness of this group.<br />This year 2000 revision of a 1989 text brings a classic introduction to the Rusyn people back into print and up to date. I call it a revision rather than a new edition because the changes are actually quite minor. Five paragraphs have been rewritten and two new ones added. To reflect the passing of eleven years, a few dates and numbers have also been changed. Two pictures were replaced with new ones and the captions to three others have been enhanced. Also, the two maps have been redrawn. On the page called Further Reading, three items were dropped  and two new items added.<br />The illustrations in this new printing suffer from a common problem with reprints. the photos are darker and less in focus than those in the original edition. If the illustrations are the important part of this book for you, then seek out the original edition rather than this updated revision.<br />The first chapter, \\"From a Little-Known Land\\", is an introduction to the geography of the Carpathian Mountain region which is the Rusyn homeland. A 1914 map of northeastern Austria-Hungary shows this land when it was last united in one country.<br />The second chapter is called \\"The Homeland\\" and follows the history of this region up to the mid-1980s when the book was written. This region is in the geographic center of Europe and has been at the divide between Eastern and Western Europe for centuries. This is the land where the Roman alphabet changes to the Cyrillic, and where western Christian and Byzantine Orthodox theologies meet. It is the home of the Uniate church, a curious compromise where Byzantine liturgies are performed in churches owing their allegiance to the pope in Rome. The language is a dialect of Ukrainian, but has been greatly influenced by the Polish and Hungarian spoken in the countries the land has been a part of for centuries. The cultural awakening of these people in the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the 18th and 19th centuries is outlined. The division of the land between Poland and Czechoslovakia at the end of World War I, and the later removal of a section into the USSR after World War II are outlined.<br />\\"Events of the Immigration\\", the third chapter, describes the conditions that led to a vast immigration of Rusyn people to the USA in the late 19th and early 20th century. This immigration was stopped by World War I and was reduced to a trickle after the war.<br />\\"The New World\\" describes the arrival of the Rusyns in the coal mines and steel mills of western Pennsylvania, and the factories of New York and New Jersey. The people brought their own Uniate priests who were often married and they built their own churches. They ran into misunderstandings with American Catholic bishops who had little knowledge of the unique situation of these eastern rite Catholic churches.<br />In \\"Assimilation and Adaptation\\" Magocsi tells the story of how these churches confronted their problems in various ways. Some of the early churches, led by Father Alexis Toth, converted to Russian Orthodoxy and built up that church in America. After World War I some churches formed a new church that was affiliated with the Greek Orthodox community. Of course, some remained in the Uniate churches of their ancestors, while still others started attending Roman Catholic churches. The Rusyn press and fraternal organizations in the USA are also described in this chapter.<br />The next chapter, \\"People of Prominence\\" , discusses some famous Rusyn-Americansand their contributions. Sandra Dee and Andy Warhol are the most famous of these but many others are also mentioned.<br />The last chapter, \\"Looking Toward the Future\\", describes the resurgence of interest in Rusyn heritage in America and mentions some of the prominent people and groups involved.<br />The illustrations in this book really make it outstanding.

The first volume covered the origins of the human race through the first civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. The second volume in the series reviewed the early cultures of India and China and then moved on to discuss Greek civilization. The third volume covered the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, from 800 BCE to 600 CE. This fourth volume surveys the rise of Islam, the Arab empires, the decline of the Byzentine Empire, and the beginnings of modern Europe.<br /><br />The book is filled with beautiful color illustrations. Every page has at least one and most are photographs of artifacts, art works, or scenes. The text is well written and emphasizes brief summaries rather than scholarly examination. This makes it a good basic introduction and outline, but may be less useful to someone who wants to look at these subjects in greater depth. The lack of any bibliography of further readings is also a drawback for those wanting to seek more information. A two-page time chart of the period helps to put events in perspective.

Surprisingly, you will have to read volume five for an introduction to the Crusades since Roberts only devotes one page to them in this volume. The beginnings of Islam is well treated, even though Muhammad himself is only mentioned in passing. Byzantium's history and influence are well documented and an explanation of the Iconoclasm dispute is well done. The last section on the formation of modern Europe through the rise of Charlemagne, and the increasing influence of the papacy is the most detailed account in the volume.<br />The type face is large and the lines are amply spaced. Couple this with the copious illustrations and the book is actually a very quick read for its size and length. It is a few steps above the approach of Dorling Kindersley books that are predominately illustrations with supporting text.

The editor claims to have gathered together for the first time \\"the relevant texts  and documents\\" related to this famous event that has intrigued readers for 200 years. In all, ten documents whose publication dates range from 1790 to 1870 are included. The first four documents make up the body of the book and consist of a series of published statements by William Blight and responses by Edward Christian, Fletcher's brother. Fletcher Christian died on Pitcairn Island and never put his story in print. These four sections are followed by six Appendixes. The first Appendix contains  a transcript of Bligh's orders and a botanical description of the breadfruit that the Bounty went to Tahiti to obtain. The remaining five Appendixes are narratives of the lives of those who stayed on the Bounty after the mutiny.<br />All of these early texts are preceded by a delightful and informative Introduction by the editor that relates the early lives of both Bligh and Christian and discusses their relationship leading up to the mutiny. It describes the mission of the Pandora to seek out the Bounty and bring back any mutineers they can find. Also covered is the trial and disposition of those sailors brought back from Tahiti. Lastly, the Introduction goes on to summarize the history of Bounty documentation and scholarship, from Bligh's first published account right on through the famous fictionalized Bounty trilogy by Nordhoff and Hall. The Introduction is followed by a one page listing of suggested further readings.<br />The first section of the book is Bligh's 1790 account of the mutiny and subsequent voyage of he and 18 crew members in the ship's 23 foot boat. He quickly recounts the details of the mutiny on the first four pages and then spends the remaining 62 pages on his heroic and epic voyage across 3,600 miles of the South Pacific that took about a month and a half. Bligh depicts himself as a dedicated leader who saved the lives of all but one crew member in this fascinating and arduous journey.<br />The second section of the book is the proceedings of the court martial of those brought back to face charges of mutiny, published in 1794 by Edward Christian in an attempt to exonerate his brother. This text consists of a written statement by Bligh, a series of interrogations of the Bounty crew regarding the events of the mutiny, and an Appendix by Edward. A picture of Bligh as a tyrant emerges from this testimony. It is 86 pages long and somewhat repetitive, but still an interesting document to read. The 20 page Appendix at the end of is Edward Christian's attempt to show that his brother had cause for his actions. Although he does not try to justify his brother's actions, he tries to show the state of desperation that his brother was driven to by Bligh's actions. Bligh was at sea when this was published and, when he returned home, he published in 1795 \\"An Answer...\\" to the statements of the Appendix which is included as the third section of this book. To this Edward Christian wrote and published a \\"Short Reply...\\" that is the fourth section of this book. This interchange in writing between Bligh and Edward Christian is wonderful to read because it presents both sides of the story in a very balanced and fair manner. Without having Fletcher Christian to defend his own actions, this set of documents is the next best thing we have to a fair presentation of both sides of the case.<br />The above documents alone would have made a wonderful and enlightening book. The editor goes on to present in the Appendixes documents that tell the story of those men who followed Fletcher Christian to Tahiti or Pitcairn Island. The first Appendix is a copy of Bligh's orders to go to Tahiti and a description of the breadfruit he was to bring to Jamaica. The second Appendix is an 1870 retelling of a journal kept by one of the sailors who was taken by the Pandora from Tahiti as a mutineer. It tells of the harsh treatment these 14 received aboard this ship and how four died when the ship sank. The next two Appendixes are accounts written by crew members of a ship that visited Pitcairn Island 19 years after the mutiny in 1808. They tell the story of the crew that landed there with Fletcher Christian and their history and families. By this time only one of the nine members of the original Bounty crew that landed on the island remained alive. The last two Appendixes are the story of one of the Tahitian women who married a Bounty crew member and the story of the last surviving crew member himself.<br />Altogether these various documents pieced together tell what we can know of the Bounty mutiny. They make fascinating reading, more interesting than the fictional accounts.

Touted as Dr. Seuss's first book for adults, The Seven Lady Godivas was originally published in 1939 and reissued in 1987. It tells the story of not one, but seven 11th Century Lady Godivas. They are sisters sworn not to marry their beaus, the seven Peeping brothers (yes, Tom is one of them) until each of them discover a scientific truth about horses. They were driven to this oath by the death of their father during an experiment using a horse as a means of transportation.<br />The history is confused, but the fun never stops. Dr. Seuss's full page drawings (in red, black and white) illustrate every other page. The end papers are a fanciful illustration of the Godiva family tree. The text, though wordier than his childrens books and not in rhyme, is thoroughly Dr. Seuss. He explains the seven sisters preference for nudity by saying they had brains and were not given to vanity. He goes on to say \\"they were simply themselves and chose not to disguise it.\\" Although this is a great summation of nudist philosophy, it doesn't say much about his regard for women who choose to wear clothes.

On the most obvious level these are great photographs taken by a master that are beautifully displayed in full-page and two-page formats.  63 black and white and 59 color photographs from Annie Leibovitz, who is one of our most famous and popular portrait photographers, are a visual treat.<br />Each picture is accompanied by a simple caption: the subject's name, profession, and where the picture was taken. All seem to have been taken in 1999, the year the book was published. The captions define the subjects while the pictures open a window into their world.<br />Leibovitz makes a statement on the status and condition of women in our society in this collection of photographs. This Leibovitz does well. She is a photographer of the rich and famous and these women are well represented in this collection. There are 12 actresses, 7 artists, 6 musicians, 6 writers, 4 performance artists, 3 First Ladies, 3 CEOs, 2 poets, 2 dancers, 2 Supreme Court justices, 2 comedians, 2 models, a general, a Secretary of State, a Cherokee chief, an opera singer, and an astronaut represented in the book. But everyday working women are also well represented. A waitress, a maid, a dragster driver, a police woman, a sewing machine operator, 2 teachers, soldiers, coal miners, farmers, restaurant customers, debutantes, cheerleaders, doctors, scientists, and activists also share these pages. Athletes are also well represented. Young women (students, a choir, and all-girl gang members) share the pages with older women. Sisters are photographed together and mothers with their children. What is revealed is the diversity and richness of women.<br />A set of photographs at the end of the book shows two views of each of four Las Vegas showgirls. Each is pictured in color in their stage costumes opposite a black and white photo of them out of costume. The theme of these seems to be the comparison of the natural vs. the adorned or crafted image of woman. All the other women in the book are represented by one image.<br />At the end of the book there are six pages where a brief biography of each subject is given. These are valuable background for each picture giving us a better look into the lives of the subjects.<br />The essay by Susan Sontag discusses the meaning of photographing women and the messages received by viewing pictures of women. She devotes a lot of her discussion to the role of female beauty in society. Its a wonderful essay to read and to accompany these photographs. These images of the beauty, dignity, and grace of modern women captured by one of our master photographers are inspiring and thought provoking.

The first volume covered the origins of the human race through the first civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt. This second volume in the series is in two parts. The first part reviews the early cultures of India and China and the second part moves on to discuss Greek civilization. Each part stands alone being a section of the ten-volume work, and are included together just to make up a book-length unit.<br /><br />The book is filled with beautiful color illustrations. Every page has at least one and most are photographs of artifacts, art works, or scenes. The text is well written and emphasizes broad summaries rather than scholarly examination. This makes it a good basic introduction and outline, but may be less useful to someone who wants to look at these subjects in greater depth. The lack of any bibliography of further readings is also a drawback for those wanting to seek more information. A two-page time chart of the period helps to put events in perspective. The chapter contents are confusingly placed at the end of the book, but they are well done and helpful for getting an overview of the author's approach. A two page listing of all the books in the series with their section and chapter titles helps to put the material into the broader view of all world history.<br />The type face is large and the lines are amply spaced. Couple this with the copious illustrations and the book is actually a very quick read for its size and length. It is a few steps above the approach of Dorling Kindersley books that are predominately illustrations with supporting text. With Roberts, the text is the major part, but the illustrations are definitely more than an after thought. This is a good introduction for the general reader. It is not going to be a lasting reference book that you will turn to again and again. Read it once and move on.	2002-01-27
US	52229186	R1VM5297QTDP7W	0813527422	957636861	Twin Towers: The Life of New York City's World Trade Center	Books	4	10	11	N	N	The Life of NYC's World Trade Center	I picked up this book after the attacks of September 11th to find out more about the buildings that I had often seen in the distance, but had never known much about. I had never been in the World Trade Center, never visited the observation deck, nor eaten at Windows on the World. I found this book very helpful in providing much information about who built it, and how. It also gives a good perspective on what it was like to work in the building.<br />And it is with that perspective that I recommend this book to others. Not anticipating the sudden and tragic demise of the towers when it was written 1n 1999, the book celebrates the life of the World Trade Center. The last part focuses on the day-to-day lives of the people of the towers and can be especially hard to read after the staggering loss of life on the day the buildings collapsed. I don't think I could read this book right now if the towers were a part of my life before that tragic day. So for the many people for whom the World Trade Center before September 11th was just a recognizable part of the New York skyline, and are interested in learning more about it now that it has so suddenly and completely been destroyed, this is a good book to read. For those whose lives were tied to the buildings in some way, this book may be too close, like a letter from a battlefield soldier that arrives after his or her death.<br />The book starts out with the background of the organization that planned and built the World Trade Center, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. This is a fascinating story in itself about the growth of a small interstate agency that started its life connecting New York and New Jersey with bridges and tunnels and went on to build the tallest and largest buildings in the area. The author goes on to tell how the Port Authority devised the project, chose an architect, fought all the criticism, and persevered to build the two tallest buildings in the world at that time.<br />Conceived in the early 1960s, started in 1966, with opening ceremonies in 1973, the World Trade Center was built in a period of great political unrest when many social values were being reexamined. The buildings were subject to a lot of criticism as the values of society were being called into question. The author tells the story of how the architectural world reacted to the towers, but also how the people came to accept the towers as a symbol of New York.<br />The book is illustrated by seven charcoal drawings by Becky Glyn and by illustrations provided by the Port Authority. Ms. Glyn's drawings are simple and expressive at the same time, but only two are of the World Trade Center towers, and all are reduced to a small 2\\"x3\\" format. More illustrative are the stock illustrations the Port Authority provided the author, including the great photo that graces the dust cover. There is a good index and good footnotes. The sources in the footnotes show that there was a lot of research behind the book, including many interviews with the people involved. Many books full of glossy color photos about the World Trade Center will come out after September 11, 2001, but this is the book about the life of New York City's World Trade Center. In that sense, it is a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives in the WTC that tragic day.rly 1960s, started in 1966, with opening ceremonies in 1973, the World Trade Center was built in a period of great political unrest when many social values were being reexamined.

The first chapter is on our primate precursors. The second chapter deals with early Homo Sapiens, and the third chapter discusses the earliest beginnings of civilized behaviors like agriculture, animal domestication, metallurgy, and community life.<br />The second section covers the earliest civilizations and consists of four chapters.

The second volume in the series discusses the early cultures of India and China and then moves on to discuss the early Greeks.<br />The book is filled with beautiful color illustrations. Every page has at least one and most are photographs of artifacts, art works, or scenes.

Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, is one of the most loved  and lovable characters ever created in the Oz series. This is the story of how she came to life and became the loyal friend of the little Munchkin boy Ojo who helped make her the unusual character she is by increasing the attributes of her brain. We also meet in this book the famous Dr. Pipt who is the creator of the marvelous Powder of Life that brought the Sawhorse, the Gump, and Jack Pumpkin head to life in the second Oz book, The Marvelous Land of Oz. Together, Ojo and Scraps, with the help of the Glass Cat, set out on a quest to save Ojo's uncle and Dr. Pipt's wife, who have been accidentally turned to stone by another magical invention of Dr. Pipt's, the Liquid of Petrifaction.<br />Along the way they receive help from the Foolish Owl, the Wise Donkey, the Woozy (a strange creature based on cubes and rectangles who breathes fire when angry), the famous Shaggy Man, Princess Dorothy, and the Scarecrow (who falls in love with Scraps). They spend an evening with the raucous Tottenhots, escape from the giant Yoop, help the Hoppers and Horners negotiate a peaceful resolution to their war, and take a ride on the most unusual river in the world. Just when they seem to be within reach of their goal, they are blocked in achieving success by the caring heart of the Tin Woodman.<br />Will they save the victims of the Liquid of Petrifaction? Read this marvelous book and find out. You will be enthralled by the characters, the story, and the beautiful illustrations of John R. Neill. The Books of Wonder edition is the only one that includes all the original color plates as well as the black and white illustrations and is by far the best edition in print. This is the seventh book in the series and was written only when the author realized that his readers wouldn't let him stop writing books about Oz. Baum would continue to produce Oz books until his last book was published after his death.	2001-12-13

It is a small book, as tall as a paperback, but square. Forty seven of the ninety five pages have color reproductions of artwork, including 16 full-page and 6 double-page illustrations. The book attractive to look at, but light on text.<br />It is divided into twenty four chapters that range from 1 to 4 pages in length. With small pages, short chapters and lots of illustrations each topic is treated quickly and without depth. Yet it is fun to read. In 9 pages you can learn the differences between Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, and Jewish concepts of Heaven. Another 12 pages takes the reader through 5 chapters that compare the ancient Heavenly concepts of Asian, Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Primal Peoples. The authors know their topic and chose highlights well. So if you are looking for fun and a brief introduction to the topic, this is a great book.<br />There is a one page listing of Further Reading, but only one book is specifically about Heaven. The rest are either classic texts of major religions or books about death and dying.<br />On the negative side, the illustrations, though beautifully colored, often suffer a loss of detail from their small size. The full-page art is better than the postage stamp sized reproductions on some other pages. Also, although the text is good at treating all cultures equally, the majority of the art is from the Christian tradition.	2001-11-16

Wells and reinterpreted by Orson Welles and many others. The texts of both the original novel and the radio broadcast are included, but there is so much more! The novel is accompanied by the original Warwick Goble illustrations that appeared in Pearson's Magazine in 1897. Although, as is often the case in reproductions, the illustrations lose a little clarity, they are still a splendid addition to the text and add to the pleasure of reading it.<br />The transcript of the Mercury Theatre radio play is in the text and the recording of the original broadcast is included on the accompanying compact disc. The disc has three interviews with Orson Welles about the broadcast, including one where he appeared with H. G. Wells on a Texas radio station in 1940. The disc also includes an excerpt from a broadcast of a different updated War of the Worlds presentation on a Buffalo, N.Y. radio station in 1968.<br />The book is divided into three parts. The first part is called The Broadcast and contains the full text of the radio play as well as two articles about the production, the players, and the effects of the broadcast. Both are wonderfully illustrated with newspaper clippings and black &amp; white photographs. Since neither are signed, I assume they were written by the editors, Brian Holmsten and Alex Lubertozzi. These two articles are excellent at setting the context of the broadcast and the background of the Mercury Theatre as well as telling the story of the panic resulting from the broadcast and the press coverage that followed.<br />The second part of the book deals with other interpretations of this story and other stories of life on Mars. This is the shortest section, but it is the only section of the book that has color illustrations. In one page, the book  briefly covers George Pal's 1953 movie, the Fox 1988 television series, Jeff Wayne's London musical comedy, and the CBS TV presentation of \\"The Night America Trembled.\\" The cursory review of other literary works that are based on the works of Wells and Welles is interesting reading, but would have benefited from more detail.<br />The third part of the book consists of an unsigned brief biography of H. G. Wells (presumably written by the two editors) which is followed by the text of the original novel. The biography is also illustrated with wonderful black and white pictures.<br />A Forward by Ray Bradbury and an Afterword by Ben Bova round out the book. Bradbury talks about the two writers and their works, while Dr. Bova discusses the scientific exploration of Mars. A two page bibliography with lots of links to Internet resources completes the book and gives the reader many resources for further information. This is a richly rewarding book with excellent illustrations, the complete texts of both versions of The War of the Worlds, and wonderful articles on the background and effects of both works.

Wanda, the author, and her brother lived with their widowed mom. As a middle-class California family, hiring a cook was an extravagance for them, but Wanda's aunt talked them into doing it. In the 1940s, when she was grown, Wanda wrote the chapters of this book as a series of articles in _Gourmet_ magazine. They were later gathered together as a book in 1947. Now the Modern Library Food Series has reprinted this delightful literary cookbook for a new generation of reader-cooks. Like many things culinary, these memoirs have improved with age.<br />The story of the book revolves around the cultural differences created as Katish and her Russian immigrant friends interact with an American middle class family of the 1920s. It is a heart-warming story in which both sides profit from the relationship. _Katish_ is a delightfully amusing glimpse into the culture of the time and is populated with warmly portrayed friends, relatives and situations.<br />As each food is discussed in the narrative, the recipe is listed. They are easy to follow and delicious. The recipes are a wonderful introduction to Russian family cooking. Breads and rolls, soups, desserts, side dishes, and main dishes are all well represented. Sadly, there is only one salad and one beverage (a delightfully rich hot chocolate). Thirty of the recipes contain meat or meat products. Thirty five are ovo-lacto vegetarian (many with butter and sour cream). Only nine are animal-free vegan recipes and six of these contain alcoholic beverages. An interesting aside is that, for a Prohibition-era story, there are surprisingly many recipes with alcoholic beverages. Dieters should be warned that most of these recipes are rich in flavor, but also in calories. However, there is a delightful fruit juice pudding called Kissel that can be made fat-free.<br />Read it for the story or read it for the recipes. Either way you are in for a treat.s.

If you are someone who has become addicted to Anne Rice's beautiful style and/or her Vampire characters, you should read this book! However, if you are not this type, not having read Rice's earlier work, I would advise against wasting your time or money. I say this because this book follows Anne Rice's formula for her later books, which is intolerable to anyone but her already loyal fans. It consists of a good introductary sequence, enough to catch the reader's attention, followed by an 100+ page boring life story, told in this book by the jerk of the century, David Talbot. Although at times amusingly unrealistic or even mildly exciting, David Talbot tells a story which is liable to put you to sleep! The only reason for anyone to read this book is for the breathtaking ending scene. Not only does this scene make up for the monotony of the entire book, it also astonishes the reader to the point of crying (on my part, anyway)! I guarantee some sort of emotional response to this book's late coming climax to any fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles! If you are not a long-time fan, however, pick up one of Rice's earlier works. Don't invest your time in this book, or any other installment of the Vampire Chronicles following Memnoch the Devil.	2001-07-02

Almost every other page contains a photograph or photographs and most of them are of women dancers in revealing costumes. Yet seldom are the pictures eroticized. They are documentary in nature. All are black-and-white and many use available light. Other were taken with on-camera flash, and still others were taken in a studio setting.<br />The text accompanying the pictures are the dancers own words. They talk about why they do this work and how they feel about dancing and the customers they dance for. Some are more articulate and insightful than others, but all are thoughtful and personal.<br />The book ends with an article, \\"Stripping for a Living,\\" by Dr. Jacqueline Boles, a Sociology professor. It describes the history and current setting of nude dancing in American society. All in all, this is a well-conceived and executed documentary on an occupation halfway between entertainer and sex worker. It is a great book for anyone who has wondered about the women who dance in these clubs.	2001-06-14

She challenges him to commit three specific crimes to win her love. As he ponders the situation the next day, we see him struggle between his emotions and his reason as he faces his challenging tasks. The overpowering desire is strong and he seeks to understand its hold over him.<br />In Book Two the illustrator is Georges Bess. He is an excellent choice and his eighteen full-page color illustrations are exceptional at setting the mood for the sensual nature of the text.

Well, maybe not my WHOLE life, but it has done wonders for that minute each weekday morning when I tie my tie. Before this book the most interesting part of this ritual was picking a colorful tie to match my clothes. Then came the boring task of getting one of the two knots I knew tied correctly. Now I can chose a knot that fits my collar line and the thickness of the tie.<br />What this book doesn't cover is the art of the tie. Ties are the most artistic part of a man's wardrobe and yet this book ignores the design element of the fabric and focuses on the knot tied about the neck to hold the tie in place. There is an introductory section on the history of neck cloths that traces them back to an ancient Chinese emperor and discusses all the major precursors to the &quot;long tie.&quot; Then the authors, who are both physicists, give a brief introduction to Topology and its branch, Knot Theory, and we are off to the fun. Using higher mathematics and a few basic assumptions about ties that they call &quot;constraints&quot; they come up with (you guessed it) 85 ways to tie a tie.<br />Although I have read the whole book, I have not tied all the knots so I can't vouch for this next part. They added additional &quot;constraints&quot; for balance and symmetry, and narrowed these 85 down to 13 that meet their demanding criteria. Even if they are right and none of the others are superb, 13 is enough to make a boring routine into an exciting choice. Still there is the thrill of the undiscovered in the 72 they rejected. One of them may be the perfect knot for that beautiful silk Indian block print tie that hasn't looked good with either of my two knots, but that I love too much to throw away. I have finally learned the names of my two original knots and learned enough about tie knots to recognize some of the more famous knots I see on others.<br />The book is illustrated with black-and-white photos of the famous and not-so-famous wearing various knots in their ties and has the most wonderful diagrams that make tie knots a joy to learn. A great book for any man who wears a tie on a regular basis.e most wonderful diagrams that make tie knots a joy to learn. A great book for any man who wears a tie on a regular basis.	2001-05-15

The first 25 pages deal with life in the Mississippi Delta and Charley Patton's role in that culture. Although brief, these pages bring the area and the culture to life in a truly remarkable way.<br />The majority of the book, from page 32 to page 111, is an in depth study of the music of this early Blues musician. In three chapters titled<br />Modes, Scales, Tunings and New Terms,<br />Tune Analysis, and<br />Tune Families<br />John Fahey provides a comprehensive discussion and five tables that arrange Patton's works by Guitar Tunings and Keys, Notes Played in Each Song, Songs According to Scale, Tune Families, and Structural Analysis.<br />The last section of the book is devoted to examining the texts of Patton's songs. Fahey concludes that, although each stanza seems to be on a specific thought, Patton seems to string together stanzas in a somewhat random order without an attempt to put together an organized story. An Appendix lists the words, notes and chords to 44 of the songs discussed in the book.<br />Illustrated with black-and-white photographs and reproductions of the original 1920's advertising fliers for the recordings, this is an important work for anyone wanting to study the music of Charlie Patton who is often called the best of the Mississippi blues singers. It is a welcome companion to have while listening to Charley Patton's music.	2001-05-14

Beginning with the myths of pre-history and working up through 1999, Andrew Wilson gives the reader a sense of what it is to be Ukrainian. This is no easy task because Ukraine is a diverse place with a west that is totally different than its east, and with many regional differences in between. He calls it an unexpected nation because its ethnic, linguistic, religious and regional diversity makes it hard for many people to think of it as a single nation. He deals with the complex relationship Ukraine has with its eastern neighbor Russia. Many Ukrainians are of Russian descent and Russian is still the language spoken in many parts of the country. Both countries lay claim to Kyiv as their ancient capital and many of their ancient heroes are the same. Ukraine lies on the border between western Europe and Eurasian Russia. Its western people look to Europe for commerce and culture just as its eastern regions favor Russia.<br />Although its borders have changed as often as its political fate, Wilson does an admirable job of inclusion. He writes about Western Ukraine, the Crimea and the Donbas (eastern Ukraine) as well as the Ukraine of Kyiv. Often this makes the book difficult to read because so many different regions and their unique perspectives must be taken into consideration. Yet this is what ultimately makes the book so rewarding.<br />Although Wilson makes use of copious footnoting, most of his references are to Ukrainian language sources that will be inaccessible to his readers. He does an admirable job of introducing us to the major players in the shaping of this new nation; yet seeking out more on any particular aspect of the story may be difficult. Wilson does provide a fine Bibliographical Essay at the end of the book to further sources in English or other Western languages that will satisfy the interested reader seeking further information.<br />The book has many fine black-and-white maps that illustrate the points in the text. Also included are two sections of black-and-white and color plates that bring life to many of the ideas presented. At the beginning of the book is a Chronology with two separate time lines: one for Politics and History and the second for Culture. This helps to put the wealth of information presented into a structured framework.<br />The author focuses on economic, political and religious power and thought and the literary and artistic expression of these in fine arts and literature. His approach is chronological, working from ancient myths and their modern interpretations, through the history of the region, right on up to the present day and the 1998 elections. It would be marvelous if a new edition would come out that includes the results of the year 2000 elections.-and-white maps that illustrate the points in the text.

The 6 page Introduction by Julian Bell is the only narrative but it is a wonderful introduction to the subject of self-portraiture in western art.  Each picture has a brief caption that lists the artist, her/his birth and death dates, title and date, a brief description of materials and size, and the location of the original. The portraits are arranged in the book in rough chronological order. At  the end of the book is an index by artist and a list of acknowledgements.<br />Each page consists of one self portrait as large as the page will allow with its caption description. One of the drawbacks to the book is that it is only 4.5\\" x 7\\", and the reproductions are small as a result. A larger format would have allowed for larger prints but would have cost more to produce.<br />Sadly, the work limits itself primarily to western art and I was left wondering about the role of self portraiture in African and Asian art. Outside minor limitations of physical size and scope of coverage, the book is exquisite candy to the eye and mind.<br />By century, the works break down as follows: 24th c. B.C.E. - 1; 9th c. - 1; 11th c. - 1; 12th c. - 1, 14th c. - 4; 15th c. - 35; 16th c. - 57; 17th c. - 78; 18th c. - 57; 19th c. - 89; 20th c. - 193. The compilers put all of an artists self portraits side by side. There are 10 Rembrandts, 4 Van Goghs, and 4 Picassos. There are also 45 self portraits by women.<br />Geographically, the artists are from 36 countries. 26 of these countries are in Europe, 4 are in the Western Hemisphere, 3 countries are in the Middle East, 2 are in Africa and one in Asia. The index in the back of the book lists the countries the artists were born in or worked in, as well as their occupations and specialties. The countries represented are Armenia, Austria, Belorussia, Bohemia, Britain, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, Finland, Flemish Belgium, France, Germany, Holland, Hungary, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Moravia, The Netherlands, North Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine.<br />I would have liked to have read this book with an encyclopedia of artists at hand.

Her Hungarian parents moved with the infant Mary from newly-formed Czechoslovakia to Trenton, New Jersey in 1921. While growing up she visited Uzhhorod with her mother a couple of times. On one of these visits she met her future husband and started a correspondence.  She moved to Uzhhorod in 1938 on the eve of World War II to marry the Hungarian man she had fallen in love with. Mary had two children and lived through World War II, the Holocaust, the transfer of Uzhhorod to Soviet Ukraine and her husband's imprisonment in the Siberian Gulags. She is kept apart from her American family by Soviet bureaucracy until her mother is finally allowed to visit in 1962.<br />The story of her life will give American readers a very accessible point of view on the history and society of the Soviet Union and western Ukraine. Her experiences as a single parent in a small regional capital in the Carpathian Mountains will be of interest to students of women's studies, Soviet history, and Ukrainian life.<br />My parents are from a small town just outside Uzhhorod and I have visited the city four times. I found her story to reflect the charm and mystery of this remote corner of the world very accurately and completely.	2001-04-15
US	52229186	R38WBMWP1TI7HF	0312158955	721791888	A Concise Historical Atlas of Eastern Europe	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A great overview and visual aid to a complicated region	This book was designed by university professors and their main goal was to create a set of maps to accompany a course on Eastern European history. The region depicted is the area between Germany and Italy on the west and Ukraine and Belarus on the east. My first disappointment in this book is that although described as an atlas of Eastern Europe, the authors leave out Ukraine, Belarus and Russia as well as Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Thus I feel the title is misleading.<br />The two-color outline maps are a little bit of a disappointment in their simplicity, but they meet the instructional goals set by the authors and admirably illustrate the historic events described on the facing pages. Four Introductory Maps (Political, Physical, Demographic, and Cultural) help the reader to interpret the historic maps that follow. Also, a two page Selected Bibliography provide ample English language resources for further study.<br />The book is divided into five broad historical eras with from six to twelve maps in each. Each map is accompanied by text on the facing page that describes the historic events of the period illustrated. I can see this as being a very valuable reference tool for anyone reading a history of this region. Rather than use it as a reference to other readings I read the book straight through and found that the progression of text is well done and readable. It makes a very good introduction to the history of the region. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a broad historical survey of the region.	2001-03-25

Building Big has sections on Bridges, Tunnels, Dams, Domes, and Skyscrapers.  Each part of the book describes the design and construction of from four to ten outstanding examples of the structure highlighted. The examples in each category are described in chronological order with some going back to the time of ancient Rome. The drawings that accompany the text are excellent at focusing on the details and techniques described. The integration of text and graphics is wonderful. In each case, Macaulay describes the design objectives, the interplay between the structure and the environment, and the engineering solutions used to bring the structures into being. This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in structural engineering and design. I have not seen the related PBS video series, but I can say that the book stands on its own very well. Highly recommended.	2001-03-12

Although written in the form of letters from a father to his daughter, this book is a great read for anyone interested in modern physics, neuroscience, and biology and their relationship to spirituality. If the \\"Dear Vanessa\\" is removed from the beginning of each chapter the letters take on a universal audience. By writing as if to a teenage daughter, the explanations of advanced scientific concepts and mindfulness practices become accessible to the general reader. Hayward re-enchants our world by showing how something he calls awareness-feeling-energy fills all of space. He shows how changing the way we think about the world can allow us to see the universe as alive and full of awareness. Three of the chapters in the book are what Hayward calls Interludes where he describes meditation practices derived from Buddhism that are aimed at helping the reader make the concepts described intellectually become integrated into consciousness. The bibliography  is divided into chapters so the reader can pursue any concept discussed as far as desired.  A great book for anyone interested in the topic.	2001-01-26

It is by far the best book written in the Oz genre since L. Frank Baum, the founder of the series, died in 1919. Paradox in Oz is Edward Einhorn's first novel and first book about Oz. It is wonderfully written and carefully plotted and does something that even L. Frank Baum had a hard time doing. It tells a wonderful story with Ozma, the fairy ruler of Oz, as the main character.<br />At the beginning of this work, the enchantment that keeps people from aging in this fairy land has ended and the people are starting to age again. Ozma must travel through time to find out what went wrong and restore the enchantment. A new character - the Parrot-Ox -  who is half parrot and half ox and who is always around but only noticable when one is confronting a paradox, helps Ozma.<br />Eric Shanower is the best living illustrator of Oz books and this book contains his best black-and-white illustrations, a delightful color dust jacket, and Escher-like endpapers of interlocking parrot-oxes (parrot-oxen?). The book is produced by Shanower's own press, Hungry Tiger, and is an artistic triumph. It is easy to see who won out when the artist and the publisher disagreed. My favorite drawing is one of six Ozmas chasing each other through a forest.<br />Oz is an imaginary land that is full of paradoxes. Some exist because it is a magical land, and others were created, often unintentionally, by the authors. Einhorn explores and exploits these many contradictions to create a story that is amusing and entertaining. Readers who are familiar with the original Oz books will find the book covers a lot of Oz history. However, people who have only read aone or two Oz books will still find the story enjoyable. It is a rich story that stands up to many readings and a beautiful book that would be a lovely gift.	2001-01-06

It is a novel based on historic fact and Prokosch did a considerable amount of research to be sure he got the facts right. The story is of a famous murder in Rome that occurred in 1598. Beatrice Cenci, the young daughter of a wealthy Roman count, killed her father with the help of her brother, her stepmother and her lover. A year later they were all found guilty and executed for the crime. The story has been told many times before in history books, fiction, plays, poems, and even music. Probably the most famous version in English is Percy B. Shelley's play, The Cenci, written in 1819. Although a great play, Shelley doesn't always get the facts straight.<br />This is the first novel that Frederic Prokosch wrote based on historic fact and he did a lot of research to ensure the accuracy of what he wrote. Prokosch was highly regarded in his time but now, a generation later, he has been mostly forgotten. This is sad because he is a great writer with an engaging style. His descriptive prose reveals his background as a poet, yet his dialog is crisp and direct. He writes mostly about the aftermath of the murder and the events leading up to the trial, detailing the tangled web of hearsay, rumor and fact that always follows a crime of national interest.<br />Highly recommended for lovers of historic fiction.	2000-12-05

She has to be the greatest artist of this genre in the 20th Century. So it is wonderful to have a collection of her paintings in a handy format for carrying around. Many of the paintings have traditional images of angels with wings, but on sixteen of the cards the images are more generally spiritual than angelic. Yet the spiritual nature of her work allows almost all her paintings to be interpreted as angelic whether the spirits or beings have wings or not.<br />On the back of each card is a short statement chosen by the editor as a meditation to use with the card. Some of these are obviously taken from other sources. E.g., a card called Prosperity has the saying: \\"I cried because I didn't have shoes, until I met a man who didn't have feet.\\"  Some seem out of place. A card called Realization states: \\"The only thing a computer cannot do -- compared to a human being -- is to look into the evening sky.\\" The painting is of two angels  holding red candles without a computer or a machine in sight. Most of the texts are OK, but not being chosen by the artist, they are separate from the paintings and don't add anything.<br />At the end of the introductory essay in Fantastic Art, Sulamith wrote the following personal statement: \\"My drawings are a visual representation of my deepest feelings: pleasure, fear, sorrow, happiness, humor. And, to people attuned to my compositions, they may well be mirrors of their own experiences. It is because of this that I have left the explanation of the drawings completely to the viewer, so that they are not bound by my interpretation of what each picture should be. For me it is not a matter of creating illustrations to fit nursery rhyme themes. My ideas come to me from many sources, and in such harmony with my personal experiences that I can turn them into these fairy compositions. My Angels are my consolers, leaders, companions, guards.&quot;<br />These cards can do the same for you that Sulamith's Angels did for her.

The indexing begins with Acorn Squash and ends with Zucchini. The reader can look up major ingredients and find lists of recipes. There is over a page of references to Zucchini recipes to help out the Summer gardener. Individual recipe names are not indexed, but well-known dishes like Gazpacho are listed with short descriptions of specific variations and the name of the book and page number where the recipe will be found. Also types of dishes like Soups, Sauces, or Salads are headings with recipes listed alphabetically beneath them, again with references to the pages in the cookbooks. Recipes are also indexed by ethnic groups, countries or regions. Being a healthy food index, recipes are even indexed by method of preparation  (e.g.: Grilled Food, Steamed Foods, etc.). The indexing is excellently done and my mouth began to water reading the brief descriptions.<br />However, this book does not have a single recipe in it. Without the indexed cookbooks, the book has little, if any, value. I personally have only one of the indexed cookbooks so this volume is of no use unless you own or buy at least some of the works indexed. Ideally, I see this book in the kitchen of a person building a collection of healthy eating cookbooks where they can use this book as a guide for purchasing quality cookbooks for their own use. Also it would be great in a small public library where they also made the effort to purchase the indexed cookbooks and maybe even keep them on a shelf together. One problem I see with this book is that the cookbooks it indexes cover a lot of different health needs. Low-fat, low-cholesterol and vegetarian (or natural foods) cookbooks are well represented. There are a couple of general food allergy cookbooks indexed as well as books on special needs like gluten-free, diabetic, and dairy-free cooking. Thus only a library or cook serving a large group of people's needs would have reason to purchase all or most of the cookbooks.<br />Also, even though this book came out only last year, a quick search of the Amazon website revealed that two of the indexed cookbooks are already out of print: Graham Kerr's Best and The Living Heart Cookbook.

It's plot fits right between L. Frank Baum's second and third Oz books: The Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. In The Marvelous Land of Oz the boy Tip escapes from Mombi the witch and has many adventures that culminate when he is returned to his true form as Ozma. The Mysterious Chronicles of Oz, written in 1985, over 80 years after Baum's two books, focuses on the transition Ozma goes through in her behavior and her mind to change from the mischievous boy Tip to the girl ruler of a fairy kingdom.<br />One morning shortly after her transformation Ozma wakes up tired of regal protocol. She dons the clothes she wore as Tip and slips out of the Emerald City with her old friend the Sawhorse determined for one last adventure. The tale is full of both flashbacks and foreshadowing of Baum's \\"future\\" works. In this book we find the origin of the Sawhorse's Red Wagon and Ozma's Magic Picture. We learn how the Cowardly Lion and his friend the Hungry Tiger come to live in the Emerald City. We are also told Jellia Jamb's history before she came to live in the Emerald City and the origins of the first Nome King, Roquat the Red. Most intriguing is the true story of the Hammerheads and the reason for their belligerence. Mr. Madden even details Ozma's first contacts with Polychrome, the Rainbow's daughter, Quox, the dragonette, and the Great Djinn Tititi-Hoochoo. Yet the biggest mystery of the book is the OPALOZ and the power it has over the whole magic land. The plot is great and J. Noel's line drawings illustrate the book well. Six tipped-in color plates and a color wrap-around book jacket illustration are special treats and absolutely charming.<br />So why didn't I give the book 4 or even 5 stars? There are over 50 Oz books in existence and so there are conventions that should be followed in writing one. Mr. Madden maddeningly renames all four lands of Oz calling them The Land of Sky Blue Waters, The Land of Purple Mountains, The Golden West, and Rosewood Meadows. Other Oz authors quickly and briefly fill in character backgrounds so as not to interrupt the story but Mr. Madden goes through long digressions to relate stories told in other books. So basically it is a great plot told with uneven writing that is distracting, but not enough to ruin the book.<br />What the book does best is tell in loving detail the mental transformation of the unruly boy Tip into the kind and loving ruler Ozma.

The device Patchen chose for the first theme is that of censorship of erotic content in literature. It is from this that the book derives its title. When this book was written in 1945, books were often published in the US with ellipses substituting for erotic content. The beginning of the book tells the story of a first novel of innocent love, called The Spool of Destiny, written by Albert Budd of Bivalve, New Jersey. An unscrupulous editor changes the book's name to The Spill of Desire and substitutes **** and . . . . for Albert's innocent words throughout the text in such quantity that the book must be published overseas. Albert becomes a best-selling pornographer who everyone wants to meet and make love to.<br />About half-way through the work Albert meets and falls in love with another innocent, Priscilla, and the story moves from the profane life of New York society to a sacred love that works miracles and heals all wrongs. This is the most moving part of the book and Patchen's best portrayal of this mystical, transformational love that inspires so many of his poems. I think many readers might give up this book in the first half and miss this gem of prose writing embedded in the second half.<br />If you like Patchen's poetry, you must read this book. If you haven't read Patchen before, stop whatever you are doing and either read this book or a book of his poetry. He is truly a great American author and this is his most approachable novel. This review is dedicated to Miriam, Kenneth Patchen's wife and inspiration, who died in 2001.	2000-10-27

First it has a short biography of Katharina Schratt, the close friend and confidant of Emperor Franz Josef in 19th Century Vienna for over 30 years. This is a great story of a relationship that is legendary and inspirational - the original story of the Emperor and the actress. Following this are two completely different but complimentary cookbooks on 19th Century Viennese cooking. One is a translation of recipes used by Schratt and hand-copied into a notebook in 1905. These are brief and somewhat difficult for the modern reader to understand because they were never intended for publication and they are from a different time and place. To help the modern reader 13 pages of notes bring these recipes to life. Yet still, they will challenge all but the most experienced Austrian cooks. The second cookbook is called Bring Vienna to Your Table! and includes modern versions of many of the classic recipes of Old Vienna. In this section you will find all the famous dishes that make Viennese cooking world-renowned: strudel, Linzer torte, gugelhupf, stuffed cabbage, creamed spinach, rice sausages, goulash, tafelspitz, dumplings, spaetzle, and croustades. All the recipes are easy to follow. These are the real thing and not for those on a diet. Treat yourself to a little of Old Vienna and read this book. You may find yourself in the kitchen like I did with my mouth watering and ready to cook.	2000-10-02

This pocket guide to Ukrainian was indispensible to me during my two week  visit to this country. I carried it with me everywhere I went and consulted  it almost constantly. In all that time it was always helpful and accurate.  The only time it let me down was in drawing a distinction between a wild  rabbit and a domestic one. Each word is given in the Ukrainian Cyrillic  spelling and then in a phonetic transliteration with accented syllables in  bold. Each section has an introductory piece that gives general background  information. Useful phrases and sentences followed by a list of major  relevant words complete each section. The end of the book has an  English-Ukrainian vocabulary. A Ukrainian-English vocabulary would also  have been useful, but would have repeated the vocabularies in each section.

The introductory material is a great guide to  pronunciation and grammar. The major part of the book is an English-Czech,  Czech-English phrasebook and dictionary in alphabetic order which is  excellent. Pronunciation guides follow most words and are well done.  Dialogues and Feature Boxes throughout this section are wonderful. I didn't  get fluent enough to make much use of the dialogues, but the Feature Boxes  were a great help in understanding an unfamiliar culture. I went through  the book reading them all to get a quick overview of Czech customs and  found it extremely helpful. There is also a large Menu Reader in the back  to help with eating out.

Eventually this collaboration developed into  a formal collection. This book gives us a wonderful glimpse of the great  works that have been created using this medium. The photographs are  arranged by decade which allows the reader to see the development in  technique and technology.  Each picture is accompanied by the name of the  photographer, their country, the title of the work,the date, and the type  of film used.

She tells her side of her love  affairs with Brian Jones, Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. Each of them are  portrayed with sincerity and honesty. You can feel the love she had for  each of them in her descriptions of their times together. Her descent into  years of drug addiction takes up most of the book. To hear her description  of it it is surprising that she survived. So it is a miracle that she has  been able to live to tell the tale so well. There is a wonderful account of  her comeback musical career in the 80s. The book is full of the famous sex,  drugs and rock n roll of the period. Yet Faithfull doesn't dwell on the  details of any of these three. I came away with the image of a strong woman  who talks honestly and directly of a life that took a sad turn into drug  addiction.	2000-08-28

Frank Baum introduced the world to Queen Ann Soforth in his novel  TIKTOK OF OZ where, bored of ruling her insignificant land of Oogaboo, she  decides to raise an army and conquer the whole world. At that time, Tiktok  and the Shaggy man of Oz prevent her from getting into too much trouble and  help her safely back to Oogaboo.  This time she leaves Oogaboo to find her  missing parents whose mysterious disappearance had put the teenager on the  throne. The Shaggy Man and Tiktok help her in the search. Along the way,  Ann and the Oogaboo youths who volunteer to come with her have a lot of fun  and learn some important lessons about relationships. Although they go  through some interesting places in Oz, this book deals more with  interpersonal relationships than wacky adventures in curious places. It is  not one of the best Oz books. The artwork is basic. Although the characters  are well developed, Oz just doesn't seem as magical in this story. On the  positive side, the author tells not only the hidden history of Oogaboo, but  also reveals some of the mystery of the Shaggy Man's past. It is a good  book for children and a great addition to the reading list of die-hard  Oz-ophiles.	2000-08-19

The title Vampires in the Carpathians was added for this 1998 English  translation and is really misleading. The last two chapters: \\"Funerals\\" and  \\"Apparitions and Supernatural Beings\\" do make passing references to  vampires, but focus mostly on other spirits. So if you are looking for a  book on vampires, look elsewhere. What little is said about vampires will  be only of interest to the serious scholar who needs to know every possible  reference in the literature.  The original title, which is the current  subtitle, is a much more accurate description of what this book is about.  However, Bogatyrev spends over 35 pages talking about his research  methodology which he calls the synchronic method. Unless this is what you  really want to learn about, I advise you skip the Introduction and  Conclusion.  His methodology is that he tells us what the ritual means to  the people performing it at that time. He does not try to draw inferences  back in time or determine origins. He just \\"tells it like it is\\" or, in  this  case, as it was back in the 1920's. What results is very  unsatisfying. He tells you a ritual and what it means in village X, then  tells you that in village Y they do the same thing, but have no idea why.  Then, he relates that in village Z they don't do this at all. He goes  through the whole religious calendar relating quaint old customs attached  to each religious holiday, then does the same for rituals attached to  births, weddings and funerals. We owe this author a debt of gratitude for  documenting this snapshot of Carpathian village life. English-speaking  folklore scholars will be glad to have access to this work and Americans of  Rusyn descent may finally understand what crazy rituals and customs drove  their grandparents to leave this rustic corner of Central Europe for the  USA and Canada. On the plus side, this is an excellent translation and the  biography of Bogatyrev is engaging.

It quotes Jack Reed, the only owner of a one-man boot shop left in Texas, saying it takes 372 steps  to make cowboy boots, but is not detailed enough to list them all. Until I  read this book, I had no idea that there was a market in vintage cowboy  boots. I found out that original ornate tops can be fitted with a replaced  foot to bring old boots back to life. Jim Arndt's photographs of boots,  bootmakers, and boot collectors are outstanding throughout and really bring  the book to life. The beginning of the book does an admirable job tracing  the history of cowboy boots back to the old Texas-to-Kansas cattle drives  of the post-Civil War era. This is followed by a great A - Z directory of  the various skins that have been used to make the boots including  characteristics, care, and current availability. The next section is a  great history of the major boot making factories and the people behind them  with chapters on Justin, Nocona, Tony Lama, Lucchese, and Rocketbuster. The  rest of the book covers the rest of the cowboy boot business and  personalities. Included are descriptions of individual bootmakers and  cowboy boot collectors. Each is lavishly illustrated with pictures of them  and their boots. The author and photographer are avid collectors and their  collections are covered in this section of the book. The book ends with an  outline of the retail side of the industry. Major sellers of new and  vintage boots are described and a state-by-state Store Guide is included.  Of course, not every state has a custom bootmaker or a vintage cowboy boot  store, but you can still find the nearest one if this book has convinced  you that you are ready for the next step above looking in the Yellow Pages  under Western Apparel. The only place where I felt this book went too far  is  when they say in the caption to a photograph: &quot;the details of this  pair of boots could be compared to a fine oil painting.&quot; But if you  want a basic knowledge of cowboy boots, or love to look at cowboy boots  either in a store or on other people's feet this is the book for you.this  pair of boots could be compared to a fine oil painting.&quot; But if you  want a basic knowledge of cowboy boots, or love to look at cowboy boots  either in a store or on other people's feet this is the book for you.	2000-06-03

Neill died in 1943 after writing three Oz books, the manuscript of this book was left without illustrations and unpublished. Preserved by Neill's family for over 50 years, Eric Shanower finally  editing it and provided his own marvelous black-and-white drawings to bring  it to press.  At the time of his death, Neill had illustrated all but the  first Oz book and his illustrations have come to define the people and land  of Oz to generations of readers. Shanower's illustrations follow in Neill's  style, improving, if that is possible, on the work of the master.  The  story evolves around the theme of anger and its effects as Scraps, the  Patchwork Girl, in a fit of anger decides to run away. Upsetting many of  the people she runs into, Scraps still manages to befriend Popla, the Power  Plant, who is possibly the most unusual character in a land known for its  strange inhabitants. Popla is the strongest plant in the world and grows  alone on a windswept mountaintop. Scraps, finding a flowerpot, takes the  Power Plant, who has never left the spot where she first sprouted, on a  exciting and enjoyable journey. Together they travel on Scraps spoolicle, a  bicycle with wooden spools for wheels, and through their adventures a  lasting friendship is created that dissolves Scraps anger. Anyone whe has  ever enjoyed an Oz book will love this unique contribution to the Oz  corpus.	2000-06-01

Her approach is to tell the story of the events through  the lives of the people involved. To do so she quotes from letters and  diaries as well as official records. In order to write in such depth, she  must have read everything ever written during this period about Lourdes.  Between the Notes and the Bibliography at the end of the book is a three  page Dramatis Personae listing all the major people associated with the  shrine. Not just for Catholics, the book devotes many pages to the role of  women in 19th Century France and will be of great interest to anyone  wanting to know about women's rights in France. It is also a &quot;must  read&quot; for people interested in French social history. She also looks  into the relationaship of anti-Semitism to the Catholic piety of the time.  People are never presented two-dimensionally to represent the ideals or  concepts they championed. Ms. Harris treats the people she writes about  with respect and intelligence. As for Bernadette's vision and the miracles,  she tells what is known (and she knows a lot!) and the reactions they  caused without taking a stand one way or the other herself. Truly a great  work of historical writing.	2000-05-28

The combination of Louys' text and Manara's art is a sure winner. Originally published in France with the original French text, this English version chooses an anonymous, but wonderful, translation from the 1920's.  Following a long tradition of publishing this work with sensuous illustrations, the publisher has come up with a new approach. They will publish an original one volume novel in four volumes and illustrate each with the work of a different artist. This first volume contains 15 full-page watercolors by Milo Manara, an artist better known for his adult comics. Those expecting Manara to have converted Louys' sensual story into a graphic novel may be surprised that this is not the case. Where Manara shines as a comic artist, his watercolors are uneven. While some are outstanding, the painting of the statue of Aphrodite is a disappointment.  The illustrated binding and layout is sumptuous... This promises to be a beautiful set with Georges Bess and Wendling slated to illustrate volumes 2 and 3. It is wonderful to see Louys' work getting this lavish treatment. The text is still vibrant enough to take on the sensual artwork of these modern artists....	2000-05-19

Ania Savage has written a wonderful book describing her journey to Ukraine during the time Ukraine was gaining its independence  from Russia. The story of her family fleeing Russian persecution when she  was six years old and her growing up in the USA with her mother's fond  memories of home adds depth to her visit to the towns of her youth. Her  description of her visits to both Western and Eastern Ukraine gives the  reader a great sense of the cultural and geographic differences in this  large Eastern European country. She works in a urban university and a rural  school and her descriptions of the people she meets are respectful but  insightful. She provides a lot of historic background to the places she  visits and her bibliography in the back of the book is a valuable resource  for further reading. This is a great book to read if you want to find out  about Ukraine at the moment this great country gained its independence. It  is a shame that almost eight years have passed between the events described  in the book and its publication. The last chapter tries to bring the reader  up to date, but it is only able to update us on the characters. It only  briefly covers events in the last eight years of Ukrainian democracy and  left me yearning for more.	2000-05-12

Neill does not write as tight a story as L. Frank Baum, but he does create characters as delightful as any developed by Ruth Plumly  Thompson. Davy Jones, the wooden whale who befriends Bucky Jones and starts  him on his quest, is one of the best. As with all Oz stories, getting there  is all the fun.

Queen Salote adds to  this uniqueness by being the ruling queen of Tonga in the first half of the  Twentieth Century, an era dominated by male chauvenism. This story of her  life and reign provides a wonderful view into the culture and history of  this island kingdom. For papalangi (the Tongan word for people of Western  society) this is not an easy book because there is a lot of Tongan names,  geneology, and customs necessarily involved in the biography of their  queen. Yet the very things that make it difficult also make it a rewarding  book to read. What makes the book most enjoyable is the portrayal of this  marvelous woman who ruled Tonga for almost 50 years. She ruled without use  of force during a time of dissent from rival nobles and emerged one of the  most revered leaders in Tongan history. She convinced her British advisors  of her ability to rule and her island adversaries that their independence  depended on her rule. I can recommend this book without reservation to  anyone interested in women's studies, international biography, Polynesian  history, or British colonial history.	2000-05-07

Paris is the third volume of the Three Cities trilogy that began with Lourdes and continued with Rome. Published in 1898, Paris is Zola's summation of the 19th Century and his predictions and hopes for the 20th  Century. In this work Zola gives a splendid portrayal of social life in  Paris at the end of the century. He takes us into the lives of men and  women of the upper classes, the working class, and even revolutionary  Anarchists. This work is of particular interest to readers today who face  the future of a new Milennium since Zola looks at the accomplishments of  his century and projects his hopes for a new century ruled by Reason and  Justice. We can see how we of the 20th Century have failed and succeeded in  bringing Zola's vision of the future to life. Zola spent his career  portraying the 19th Century France through the lives of his characters. In  this final work of the Century, he uses his story telling powers to create  a portrait of the time through the lives of his characters.	2000-02-15

Rome picks up the story of a  disillusioned priest as he goes to Rome to defend his book which is to be  placed on the Index of Prohibited Books. The story explores his hope for a  new Christianity that will meet the needs of modern society and his  confrontation with a religious organization unable to change with the  times. Zola's critical description of Papal bureaucracy will not endear  this work to devout Catholics, but his description of the inner workings of  the Vatican is informative and fascinating.	2000-02-13

Using the architectural records left behind as well as statements of people who were  there to outline the story, the authors trace the development and changes  of the Auschwitz camps from 1939 to the present day. The skillful use of  architectural plans provides insight into the changing purposes the camp  adapted to in its short but terrible life. Also, the authors trace the  German influence in the area back to the founding of the town in 1270 and  relate the camp's shifting purpose to the territorial goals of the Germans  in the East both before and during the war.	1999-07-03

This is the fascinating story of a country that has been a part of five different nations in the 20th Century and whose people  today live in six different countries. It was a part of the Hungarian  Empire until the end of the First World War. After the war it was promised  autonomy as Subcarpathian Ruthenia, the third part of Czechoslovakia, but  this was never realized until the break-up of this country in 1938-39. Then  for three days in March of 1939 it was the independent country of  Carpatho-Ukraine, until the Hungarian Army crossed the border to reclaim  it. In 1945 the Czechs and Russians agreed to make it part of the Ukraine  without consulting its people. Shandor was the Ruthenian delegate in Prague  between the two wars and has quite a tale to tell. Occasionally, the reader  is swamped with names and details mentioned to prove Shandor's point of  view. The presentation could have been more balanced, but overall it is  fascinating reading.	1999-01-12

LOURDES tells the story of a four day pilgramage to the famous shrine in the late 19th century from the point of view of an abbe who has lost faith. He accompanies a childhood friend and her father as they seek a cure for  her paralysis and pain. The abbe is no believer in miracles and his story  is about the faith of those who have no where else to turn. Still powerful  today, as many turn from a science-based medical establishment, when it  offers no cures, to faith healings which heal, if not always the physical  symptoms, the anguish and pain of hopelessness, this book explores the  hearts and minds of the faithful with respect and insight. Zola's  descriptions of trains and hospitals full of the diseased hopeful are  overwhelming to read. His mixing of the political, the spiritual and the  personal is well-balanced and provides a great tale.  You will find the  story of Bernadette and the Lady of Lourdes here, but if you are looking  for inspirational reading about miraculous cures, you should look  elsewhere. This book is about the very human side of a place usually known  only for its miracles.	1998-12-21
