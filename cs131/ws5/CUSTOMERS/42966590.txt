This book follows the same pattern of the previous two, with short chapters, lots of action; all done with great storytelling skills. You just have to read one more chapter!<br /><br />I initially thought that this series was to be a trilogy*, but apparently there is a 4th and 5th book to come(according to the book legend in the front of this book).<br /><br />In my opinion, this book is the best of the three so far,  and I'm looking forward to the next in the series.<br /><br />* P.S.<br />The fourth book \\"Alector's Choice\\" uses a completely new set of characters and although taking place on Corus, occurs in a time far before Alucius's story.	2005-10-10

There is, however, enough action to keep the story interesting and moving along.(with the exception of one, somewhat repetitious part, about 4/5 the way through).<br /><br />If you liked the first book, \\"Legacies\\", then you will like this one as well. It's not deep, but it is entertaining and will keep you coming back to it until it's finished.	2005-09-29

I found myself eager to get back to it whenever I found a spare moment.<br /><br />I found I liked the central figure (Alucius) and his special \\"talent\\". Also, there seemed to be just the right balance of magic, suspense, love, friendship and battles to make this work a pleasure to read for any fantasy/adventure fan.  Recommended!	2005-09-25

Now, I find I've less respect some of these authors than I did before, and I've become determined not to be influenced again, when buying a book, by another \\"pretty face\\".<br /><br />The story initially seemed to have such great prospects; revolving around two central figures who, while simultaneously on the same side, are constantly suspicious of each others intentions. Unfortunately, this theme became tiresome when it began reappearing in chapter after chapter, with nothing ever changing and with nothing ever resolved.<br /><br />There were times when I thought the story was finally gelling into something substantial, only to find it falling flat... again.<br /><br />Another concern was the writing of the battle scenes; the good guys always seemed at an initial disadvantage, but were repeatably able to win with surprising ease and lack of substantial casualties.<br /><br />This book, at times (albeit rarely), showed promise but the difference between promising and producing has resulted in a novel that is lacking in overall quality.  1 1/2 stars (grudgingly rounded up to 2).	2005-09-18

This story is broken into two parts; one follows Roran (Eragon's cousin) and his flight from Carvahall, and the other tale, as you might guess,  is about Eragon. Was it worth the wait? Well yes and no... let me explain.<br /><br />The pros<br /><br />-There is a good map and also(to refresh your memory) a short synopsis of what has transpired in the first novel.<br />-The writing is well done, with vivid descriptions of persons, places and things; also character development is also well executed, giving us some insight into some of the other significant people in the novel.<br />-There were some very suspenseful moments in Roran's story making it hard to put down.<br /><br />The cons  (spoiler)<br /><br />-Well, to the negative...to be honest with you I was extremely bored with Eragon's tale. I had this increasingly uncomfortable feeling about this section after the first 100 pages or so. It became obvious  that this entire part of the novel was going to be about Eragon's trip to the elves for  training, and little else. Other than an occasional conflict of personalities, absolutely nothing happens until the very end. An ambush, a raid, a side trip to some dark foreboding place would have been so easy to include here and done so much to relieve the monotony of this long, virtually uneventful tale.<br /><br />All in all a good effort, but it misses the mark of greatness. A little more action (which the author is very capable of delivering, as witnessed by some of his battle scenes) would have turned this sleeper into a runaway fantasy milestone. 3 1/2 stars.	2005-09-02

It contains the same quality of story telling that fantasy readers have come to know and relish with this author's  \\" Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" series. (in fact the story itself takes place in the Malazan sphere of influence)<br /><br />I really like Erikson's descriptive narrative abilities; he has such a natural way of making the words on the page transport you to another place and make you feel a part of the surroundings. In this instance, it's a sombre mood with a chilling atmosphere in a town called \\"Lamentable Moll\\" (don't you just love the name). A place as seedy as they come, where there has been murder, multiple murders in fact, and the local gendarme has been charged to find out what is going on. And what he finds out is...well, lets say, unexpected.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful read; if you like the \\"Malazan\\" series you'll love this. Highly recommended!	2005-08-26

A great novel!<br /><br />This  book, by Francis Itani, revolves around the world of a girl/woman who as acquired deafness through childhood illness. The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.<br /><br />I must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.<br /><br />As with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing.  The prose just seemed to flow effortlessly off the pages as time melted away. You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before;  you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.<br /><br />There are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)<br /><br />All in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books. If I had to compare it to another book for quality, beauty and heartrending appeal, then I'd pick Charles Frazier's \\" Cold Mountain\\". Both books have that intangible timeless aura to them that separate them from their peers.<br />Highly recommended!	2005-08-16

This is a fabulous continuation to Book One, \\"Myrren's Gift\\".<br /><br />In my opinion, Fiona McIntosh is quickly becoming one of the best fantasy writers out there; this work ranks up there with the heavy weight authors of the genre such as George Martin ( Fire and Ice), Scott Bakker ( The Prince of Nothing), and Stephen Erikson (The Malazan Book of the Fallen)<br /><br />This original storyline keeps you turning the pages with its fast pace and unexpected  developments. Just when you thinks things are finally settling down...well, another surprise is just around the corner.  As with the first book, magic, deceit, love, cruelty and betrayal play a part in telling of this magnificent tale.<br /><br />All in all, simply great fantasy writing! The final book in this trilogy is due out early next year and I can hardly wait. If you enjoy the fantasy/adventure genre then read \\"Blood and Memory\\", you will not be disappointed.	2005-08-01

(and deservedly so, in my opinion).<br /><br />The story revolves around the interaction of a group of slaves, (some freed, most not) and slave owners in Virginia in the 1830s and 40s.<br /><br />Not unexpectedly, it is the quality of story telling that distinguishes this book and has made it a major prize winner. The written words seem to flow effortlessly off the page  giving the  reader a sensation of comfort and enjoyment with the passage of each chapter.<br /><br />Have you ever been able to sit in a comfy chair on the porch on a warm summer evening, watching a sunset through the remains of  the days heat haze and listening to the frogs begin to chirp? Nothing to rush you, no pressing  commitments, just plain contentment, well that's what reading this book reminded my of.<br /><br />I found a good friend in this book and hated to see it come to an end.

Add to this the inane conversations between Matt and Kate and you have a book that could have been great but instead  struggles to lift itself above mediocrity. Although a completely different story, it reminds me of the same disappointment, the same letdown, I felt about \\"Inkheart\\", by Cornelia Funke.<br /><br />Now, having read this book, I find it difficult to understand how this book could win a Governor General's Award (Canada). And then there are the beaming tributes;  for example, \\"This book is a must read\\" says the Montreal Gazette... Well, I guess it's just a matter of personal taste and preferences: just not my tastes and preferences.<br /><br />All in all, a book that would probably entertain the older child age group; other readers would be well advised to look elsewhere.<br /><br />However as a Young Adult work I would rate this is 4 Stars, despite my personal preferences.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson	2005-07-10

Unfortunately this is not the case...  Let me explain.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />The book has an enticing cover, an intriguing beginning, and a very good ending; it also has a great concept in the way the book \\"Inkheart\\" was used in the story as the central force behind the plot. So far so good, however...<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />However, the  novel was decidedly disappointing throughout the middle section. The characters were frustrating; their actions and decision repeatedly bringing them into harms way that even a simpleton would have recognized and avoided. Also, I'm still trying to figure out what the real role Elinor had in this book; maybe she's intended to be  a source of comic relief. Except she's not funny and again like so much of the middle portion of this book, does things that continually jeopardizes the entire group as they muddle on towards the end. Another example is \\"Tinkerbell\\" (from Peter Pan), introduced about 2/3 the way through the book, mentioned several times, but had absolutely nothing to do with any of the characters or the storyline. Strange!<br /><br />This book had such promise; but the weakly developed and totally forgettable main characters, (in addition to the erroneous thinking and actions on the part of our \\"heros\\"), continually left me cringing at their shortcomings.<br /><br />All in all, this book would appeal to the older child or young adult; anyone that is a true adult fantasy lover, would have difficulty being pleased with this effort. The pity of it all is that this book was so close to being a great fantasy read.	2005-07-02

This is a top notch fantasy/adventure.<br /><br />I must admit the beginning was a little slow to get going, but once into this novel, I found it hard to put down. Some of the reviews on the covers described it as a real pager turner and I'd have to agree. It was one of those books that I really looked forward to getting a few minutes to read  a few more pages.<br /><br />The novel has all the ingredients for an intriguing fantasy story; there is magic, betrayal, love, unspeakable cruelty, true kindness and friendship and some unexpected sudden changes in circumstance; . (in some ways reminded me of George Martin's \\"Fire and Ice\\" series). You will find that Myrren's \\"gift\\" adds a definite twist in the genre of average fantasy tales.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers mentioned that the writing quality was not great, and, to a certain degree, this may be true, but the story itself is so interesting, you become deeply immersed in it before you realize what's happening. I felt the quality of the book and story telling improved as the novel progressed and at the end I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I neared the riveting conclusion of  this book.<br /><br />All in all, good fantasy reading; I'm looking forward to Book II	2005-06-21

A disappointing read.<br /><br />Having exhausted the supply of my favorite fantasy writers (see list below), I came upon this effort by R.A. Salvatore and despite the lack of any reviews (superlative or otherwise) on the back and front covers I decided to give it a try anyway.<br /><br />The story line was not bad but I had 2 major concerns with this book.<br /><br />1.) All the \\"good guys\\" are squeaky clean; not a character flaw to be found among all of them put together.<br /><br />2.) And my chief complaint; As soon as I read a few paragraphs of the first battle scene I got this uneasy feeling about Mr. Salvatore's battle writing technique. You just could tell that no matter what the dire predicament, no matter what the staggering numbers of bad guys verses good guys, that the monsters and evil doers simply never had a chance.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like the good guys to win as well, but a least there should be an element of doubt as to the outcome, rather them making the battles an almost foregone conclusion.<br /><br />In fairness to Mr. Salvatore, I believe this was one of his first efforts. However, the shortcomings mentioned above, were enough to make me not bother to read the rest of this trilogy. This book turned out to be less than satisfying. 1 1/2 Stars.<br /><br />P.S. If you want gut wrenching fantasy that has some unpredictability and surprises, I'd humbly suggest one of the following authors; that being S. Erikson (\\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\"), Scott Bakker (\\"Prince of Nothing\\") or R.R. Martin's incredible \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.	2005-04-29

A great read!<br /><br />This book, the first in a trilogy, turned out to be a well written fantasy that increasingly held my interest and by the end of it, left me eager to get to the next installment.<br /><br />The story revolves around the main character, Nazhuret (an interesting gnome like figure who is a lot more that he appears), his travels and his interaction with people and things he meets on his journey. There are several other important people in this tale and Macavoy does a stellar job in developing and introducing them into the plot.<br /><br />My only niggling complaint is a lack of a map of the area that would have let us to track the adventures of our hero.<br /><br />All in all, a good fantasy adventure and I'm looking forward to more.	2005-04-28

The story line continues with its fresh, innovative approach with Bartimaeus and Nathaniel getting into all kinds of new intriguing, chilling situations. Stroud's story telling has an addictive quality to it that makes you want to keep on reading; you can absorb several chapters in a sitting without realizing how much time has past.<br /><br />Bartimaeus, the main character, has a wonderfully warped cynical sense of humor along with a generally condescending view of just about everything and everyone; it's his character that makes this series the so compelling.<br /><br />I had  one minor complaint about this novel and that revolves around the initial development of Kitty's character (who we met briefly in the first novel). This area of the novel is slow, tedious and predictable and I must admit that I had a hard time getting through this part at first, however once she gets into the story proper she is an interesting and important part of the tale.<br /><br />And finally, a personal subjective opinion; I had expected Nathaniel to mature somewhat as he grew older and had improved his stature within his profession, but instead he has remained a petulant little twerp; however, (and I had to remind myself several times) that this tale is primarily about Bartimaeus, and Nathaniel is more of a secondary, albeit important, character here.<br /><br />All in all, a great addition to this ongoing fantasy.  4  ½ stars.	2005-03-28

It chronicles the adventures/misadventures of the Holy War as it slowly advances southward toward its ultimate goal at Shimeh.<br /><br />We see several characters that rose to the fore in Book 1 continue to dominate the main story of Book 2: those persons being Kellhus, Achamian, Cnaiur, Esmi, and Serwe, but we also keep in close contact with a host of other major participants we meet in the initial book.<br /><br />I found the story, after a somewhat slow start, a real page-turner. The descriptive prose was of the highest quality, especially Bakker's ability to describe the subtle textures and colors of surrounding environments. I really liked his use of the inserted italic word to show what people were really thinking even though their actual conversation may indicate something completely different.<br /><br />My only complaint for this second book was what I felt was the overuse of profanity in what seemed to me, unwarranted places. Also, all the women in this book, and to some degree in the first book, seem to be sexually exploited on either a consensual or violate basis.<br /><br />All in all, despite the few concerns mentioned above, a fabulous follow up to the first book. Although there is no specific mention of another book in the series, one would have to assume that there is more to come that will clear up some major loose ends that finish up this book.	2005-03-22

K. Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series will be pleased with this offering by Jonathon Stroud. The setting is in modern day London and features two initially antagonistic heroes; that being Bartimeaus, (a demon) and Nathaniel (a young apprentice magician)<br /><br />What makes this novel so \\"special\\" is its extremely addictive and fresh story line coupled with an easy to read writing style. It's a \\"I just have to read one more paragraph, one more chapter\\" type of book.<br /><br />The main characters are intriguing; especially Bartimaeus, who has been reluctantly summoned by the novice magician. As you get into this novel he shows his true nature, a cynical sense of humor and condescending attitude to all things (both human and fellow demons alike). His mind is usually preoccupied by one of two thoughts; that being, some sort of revenge towards someone or, more importantly, self preservation (and not necessarily in that order). It's impossible not to like this cunning creature, even with all his sense of righteous indignation.<br /><br />Nathaniel's character, who we initially meet as a young child, develops into an interesting adolescence; replete with all the difficulties and awkwardness of going through this age group. As his relationship develops with Bartimaeus, his magic abilities grow but he still struggles with some youthful immaturity.<br /><br />All in all a superb opening for this trilogy: I loved this book; could hardly wait to find time to get back to it and I'm looking forward to Book II.	2005-03-17

The book begins with a short synopsis of what has taken place previously. This story line and structure remain much the same as the preceding series; with the slow build up, constant self-doubts and self-incriminations by (in this case)  the heroine of the novel, and finally resolve and determination directed towards the conflict at hand.<br /><br />In short, I loved the novel; it got better and better as it went along and it came to the point where I found it hard to put down.<br /><br />And yet, (and I just have to mention this) the work has, what I feel to be a flaw: an error of grammatical license if you would... let me explain.<br /><br />My concern or \\"flaw\\" in this case is the word \\"percipience\\"; I noticed it many times in the first half of the book and then I started to count the number of times it appeared from page 250 until the end. A total of 23 times. Roget's thesaurus list 36 different alternatives for the word \\"percipience\\". I just find it hard to believe the author, proof readers or editors didn't pick up on this rather amateurish mistake. But then maybe it was deliberate. Who knows! In any event, it became hard not to cringe when I came upon one of the repetitious uses of this word. (Sorry, I just had to get that off my mind.)<br /><br />Notwithstanding, and aside from my little \\"rant\\" above, it was a great read; a fine continuation of the Thomas Covenant Chronicles and I can hardly wait for the next installment.

An incredible fantasy/adventure.<br /><br />I've been a fantasy reader for years now and thought I'd about run the gambit of available books/authors to read. I'd just recently finish Steven Erikson's \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\"(5 books) and Scott Bakker's \\"Prince of Nothing\\" (2 Books) and felt that these efforts were about as good epic fantasy as I've ever come across. That is, until I found this book in the \\"Fire and Ice\\" series; this book by G.R.R. Martin is, I think, one the best I've ever read in the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Why?... let me elaborate.<br /><br />We've all heard a great story teller whose voice kind of mesmerizes you and you become completely absorbed in what is being spoken. Well, this story has the same effect but with the written word instead of the spoken.<br /><br />The story is huge in scope and breadth but yet it does not ramble on with endless fill. Each chapter, even each paragraph, seems to bring some point of interest  that adds to the aura of the story being presented. It is simply readable in the purest sense: you want to get back to this book; you look for time to have to yourself to get \\"a get a few more pages in\\". It's that good!<br /><br />The characters seem real, believable: some you love and others you love to hate. There is travel, battles, magic and betrayals. Something for all fantasy lovers; but more important, done with a quality that stands out and leaves you eager for more.	2004-12-21

I found myself returning to thoughts of those early and dreaded grammar school lessons (at which I did very poorly) From thereon the book became tedious and difficult to read and enjoy. I was back in school and this book was really  a teaching manual; something to be studied and learned, i.e work. I could not finish it.<br /><br />The other interesting thing was that two friends who saw this book sitting on the table and borrowed it, ended up with the same impression as I did. (and the same unfinished result)<br /><br />Obviously, some people loved this book (see other reviews) but it was not what I was looking for.	2004-11-01

It had everything; great battles (large and small), mysterious places and circumstance, devious twists and turns and some unforgettable characters and creatures. There was even a few moments of quiet sadness and heartfelt tenderness that balanced some of the chaos that seemed the norm for the ka-tet of Roland and company.<br /><br />Some reviewers disliked the Coda, but one really has to allow Mr. King some artistic license to end his story the way he wishes. However, I thought this addendum was the perfect todash nightmare.<br /><br />All in all a great finale. Bravo!!!	2004-10-29

This particular character I did not really \\"bond\\" with; thus this first part of this book I found somewhat tedious and took me a long time to get through. After this initial slow beginning the author then reverted to his normal style of story telling and I found this much more interesting and I had that urge to get back to this book and read whenever I could.<br /><br />The other area of concern (at least to me) was the ending; with so many characters in so many different places that I found it difficult to tell just what was going on, to whom and where events were happening.<br /><br />All in all a good book 4, in this otherwise magnificent series; just not quite up quality of the previous three.	2004-10-24

It's classic de Berniere; with the first part of the book dealing with character introduction and development. Then the second half telling how a series of wars in the early 1900's changes their lives forever; upsetting a previously workable coexistence between Greeks and Turks in the Balkan region (and within these two nationalities, Muslims and Christians).<br /><br />There are some very graphic depictions of the horrors of war, yet the quality of the story telling just makes you get through these tough sections and keep those pages turning. This is a difficult book to put down once you get into the main story.<br /><br />On the other side there are some moments of compelling sadness and of heart rendering kindness that leaves you with a lump in your throat and your eyes moist. Moments that simply make you stop reading, let the book fall to your lap and just makes you reflect on what you have just read.<br /><br />Story telling at its best! Highly recommended.	2004-08-21

It is the first of a series and I'm itching for the next volume to come out  (expected sometime quite soon, in fact)<br />The first part of this book reminded me a lot of Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\": that being, a rather diverse, confusing, \\"I wondering what's going on here\\", beginning: and like \\"Dune\\", your patience is rewarded  as the individual pieces eventually get pulled together, making for one great story.<br />The story itself is fresh and  intriguing; with plots and subplots involving individuals and also on a more global scale.  There is a wealth of interesting characters and substantial  character development.  You will find war, revenge, deception, journeys, and an erotic sexy quality to the sporadic love scenes: all of which make this novel very readable and addicting.<br />If you liked the style of  story telling you found in \\"Dune\\" or if you just like great fantasy writing, I would recommend this novel.	2004-04-15

The heroine is a teenage white  girl named Lily who has previously lost her mother under somewhat mysterious circumstances and then, after years of abuse, runs away from an exceptionally cruel father. The bulk of the story takes place after Lily has been taken in and cared for by 3 black sisters, one of which is a beekeeper: it is at this point her \\"education\\" begins.<br />Each chapter in the book is prefaced by a short statement about the life in a beehive (thus the name of the novel):  then the following chapter will, in some way, parallel Lily's story  with that previous statement about the bees. A unique concept but one that works very well in this setting.<br />The book is extremely well written, captivating and  is a roller coaster ride of emotions as Lily's situation changes with her development. The author has exceptional abilities to present to the reader what Lily is actually thinking that is, to me at least, so realistic, so \\" right on the mark\\" , that you could not help be enamored by the heroine and her slow, soul searching maturation and awareness.<br />A must read! Highly recommended. It's just hard to imagine that this masterpiece didn't win some literary award.	2003-06-28

Let me explain.....I really wanted to like this book, as I have a great interest in stories involving the era surrounding the American civil war. Also the tantalizing review on the front cover, which reads \\" 'Enemy Women' deserves the Pulitzer Prize\\", had me drooling to get into this story. However, I don't think I could honestly say that it deserves a Pulitzer because I found that the quality of writing of this work seems to fall into two categories: initially average, and then terrific.<br /> The first third of the book seemed to be somewhat slow and ponderous. Coincidental happenings seemed all too predictable, so much so, that I almost discarded this book at this point but persevered on, and I'm glad I did.<br />The latter part, however, was a tour de force of intriguing and suspenseful story telling of the finest quality and the book become difficult to put down. I found here an imaginative, addictive style of writing that seemed far removed from the techniques used at the beginning of this work: a narrative approach that at times reminded me of Charles Frazier's \\" Cold Mountain\\". (Another magnificent Civil War story of epic proportions) It just kept getting better and better.<br />All in all a good read. . Recommended.	2003-05-17

There is one moment of such compassionate violence that I still think of, even though I read this book a couple of years ago.<br />In short, a masterpiece of writing and story telling: one of these rare books you hate to see come to an end.	2003-03-14

Elisha Hunt Rhodes joined the Rhode Island Volunteers in 1861 as a private and left as a colonel in 1865; having earned the respect of not only his peers but his superiors as well. The book is a diary (plus a few letters) he kept during his army life: it includes daily to weekly accounts of the people and places he got to know and see, plus the battles with which he was involved.<br />The diary is well written (better than you'd expect from a 19-year-old in 1861). There are accounts of the marches that covered seemly unbelievable distances: wearing the men in to a state of complete exhaustion. (And often, after reaching their destination, would have to march back to where they started) There are tales of deprivation, hunger, prolonged stress, boredom and even some humorous moments as well. The descriptions of some of the carnage is told in a rather detached, matter of fact manner, (probably understandable, given the circumstances) even though he was in the midst of several of these bloody scenes and lost countless friends and colleagues.<br />The diary was recorded chronologically and with dates: also included, is an excellent map of the area. The map even outlines the marches that the 2nd R. I. Volunteers participated in during their 4 years at war. This is a wonderful addition to this book that not only makes following the events easy but also makes you appreciate the distance that these armies traveled, mostly on foot.<br />All in all, an interesting, personal account of the American Civil War: one that gives new insights into an era of history that has significantly shaped the United States into the country that we know today.

Aytch: A Confederate Memoir of the Civil War	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Memoirs of a Rebel soldier	This is a wonderful book by Sam R Watkins: a confederate soldier that survived the entire American Civil War (1861-1865).  Watkins was a private who joined the Tennessee Army and with whom he participated in every battle and skirmish that the regiment was involved.  He received several wounds but never any serious enough to keep him out of action for very long.<br />These memoirs where written about 20 years (circa 1882) after the last shot was fired and so there are some minor errors in the facts regarding some of the events described. The descriptions are short individual vignettes of battles, marches and daily life associated with the Confederate Army.<br />What makes this account of the civil war special is the quality of the story telling. The language has a sensitivity to it that seems to capture your imagination and emotions. It is, of course, at times explicitly descriptive, regarding some of the battles and their aftermath, but there are passages that are movingly sad and others that are quite humorous: tales of how thousands of men have to learn to live together and adapt to survive prolonged stressful conditions. The narrative description of the deprivation and dilapidation of the Confederate Army at wars end is heart rendering; men in filthy, tattered clothes, many barefoot and starving.<br />I learned several things from this work; for instance, I was unaware of the numerous small battles that never claimed the infamy of Gettysburg, Antietam, Manassas etc. but were none the less just as vicious as their larger counterparts. Daily skirmishes were not an infrequent occurrence. I was unaware previously of the frequent court-martials and firing squads used to deal with the relatively large number of deserters from the Southern Army. Also interesting was the acute awareness and acumen of the lowly private soldiers regarding the circumstances surrounding some events that were looming in their immediate future; i.e. battle formations, forced marches, incompetent leaders etc.  If the generals had the instincts that some of the \\"regulars\\" did, a lot of the carnage may have been substantially reduced or avoided.<br />The only negatives are (thus the loss of one star)<br /> 1.) there are very few dates given(you assume the book runs chronologically)<br /> 2.) a map would have made it so much easier to follow the marches and battles locations<br />All in all a compelling work: personal insights that you just don't find in larger accounts of this period.<br />Highly recommended if you have any interest in the Civil War era.tent leaders etc.  If the generals had the instincts that some of the \\"regulars\\" did, a lot of the carnage may have been substantially reduced or avoided. <br />The only negatives are (thus the loss of one star)<BR> 1.) there are very few dates given(you assume the book runs chronologically) <BR> 2.) a map would have made it so much easier to follow the marches and battles locations<br />All in all a compelling work: personal insights that you just don't find in larger accounts of this period.<BR>Highly recommended if you have any interest in the Civil War era.	2003-02-18
US	42966590	RED9K2Z7A0OET	0500281076	588897897	1791: Mozart's Last Year	Books	5	33	33	N	N	Well written and informative plus a lot of extra details	This is a well-researched book by Robbins Landon not only giving a detailed glimpse of Mozart in 1791 but also the ongoing intrigues associated with life in late 18th century Vienna. Discussed in detail are the three main compositions that he completed during this final year: those being, The Magic Flute, La Clemenza di Tito and his Requiem. There is an interesting section on Mozart's death and the myths and suspicions associated with his final illness. The last chapter is devoted to Constanze and her struggles to survive after Mozart's death.<br /><br />The book has extensive reference notes, a detailed bibliography and an index that list people who were part of Mozart's life during this period. Also included are some interesting sketches of Mozart's apartment and an area map of Vienna where he and Constanze live in during his last year.<br />What I personally found of interest, resulted from the extra measures that Robbins Landon goes to give added details on some topics (in particular the 3 works mentioned above). Insights as to the sequencing of construction, participation of other people and outside distractions that influenced Mozart's ability to work on and complete these projects. For example: the fact that 5 different types of sheet paper were used by Mozart during the writing of \\"La Clemenza di Tito\\" gives clues not only as to the actual chronological order that some of the  scenes were composed, but also an idea as to the geographic locales where different parts this opera was conceived. i.e. Prague or Vienna<br />It seems hard to believe that retrieving accurate material on Mozart's life and music would be difficult, given his fame. You'd just assume that every note (musical or otherwise) that he wrote would have been recorded for the sake of posterity: sadly, such is not the case. Although Mozart was regarded as a brilliant musician during his time he was only recognized for his true genius, posthumously. So, although a lot of the musical scores, letters, writings and conversation have survived, many were lost or went missing over the past 200 years. What a pity!<br />Well written and informative. This is certainly a book of special interest, but one that goes beyond the superficial discussions of Mozart's life.

Also included is a diary he kept during his travels to Europe and the Middle East, also between Dec./00 and July 02.<br /><br />The columns themselves, can be divided into three general categories 1.) The Palestine/ Israel conflict 2.) Arab/Muslim concerns, especially with regards to government and education, and 3.) American foreign affairs policies (management and mismanagement). Whether you agree or not with Mr. Friedman's thoughts is a personal matter, but the issues he raises are certainly not only thought provoking (because they have such far reaching, world wide implications) but yet, at the same time, disturbing, because the problems seem to be increasing exponentially (instead of receding) and any attempt at a solution seems to be light years away. I don't think I've read anyone who has been able to describe and dissect the events that lead up to and have occurred since 9/11 as well as Mr. Friedman. The author also puts forward some of his own ideas as to some potential solutions (or a least places to start) for some of these most troubling of issues.<br /><br />The only quibble I would have with regards to this book is that some of the material is repetitious. This is not so apparent if you read his column in the newspaper on a twice-weekly basis but becomes more obvious when you read a collection of these vignettes in a sitting.<br /><br />Finally, I must compliment Mr. Friedman's abilities as a writer: I was concerned when I considered purchasing this book, knowing it was basically a collection of his columns, that the articles would be hindered by the \\"pressure of deadline\\" and the \\"pressure of length\\". Writing columns twice a week must be a tremendous burden; to do this week after week must be extremely difficult on those occasions when you are fatigued, come up \\"dry\\" or have an episode of writer's block. Similarly writing a column 740 words long must also be hard: sometimes having to condense a long article and other times adding \\"fill\\" to make up the required length. However, I had little reason for concern, as most compositions seem to flow naturally and fit perfectly into an easy reading cadence that seemed of appropriate length.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone interested in the events surrounding 9/11, Middle East politics or U.S. foreign affair in this area of the world.ine\\" and the \\"pressure of length\\".

The material used in this biography include Da Ponte's own memoirs and various others letters and text that documented his life in Europe and America. In the back, the book list chronologically dates that of were of importance to Da Ponte, dates of his writings (poems, letters etc.) and finally dates of his libretti. There is also an extensive bibliography and a complete index of the names of people in the book who were part of his life.<br /><br />The book deals extensively with all sections of Da Ponte's life including his growing up, his work in Vienna, (where he met Mozart and worked for Emperor Joseph), his life in London, and finally his last years in America. Among these segments we see a young man who could not resist the fairer sex; a gullible soul who repeatedly lent money to people and rogues that could not or would not repay him, thus leaving him in an almost constant state of poverty throughout his entire lifetime. As that saying goes \\"he was his own worse enemy\\".<br /><br />Personally, I had hoped to gain some insight into the working relationship between himself and Mozart but there is apparently little record of their actual association. What did come out, that is intriguing, is the apparent sway Da Ponte's skill with the libretti had in determining the music that Mozart eventually wrote for the three operas mentioned above. This ability seemed to arise from his upbringing and his education as a young man, where eventually he developed his talent to write these fabulous Italian libretti: libretti that were not only used by Mozart, but by many other composers of the day, including Salieri and Martin Y Soler, just to mention a few. It appears plausable, that without Da Ponte's influence on Mozart, that these three masterpieces would be substantially different than what we know today.<br /><br />The book is well written, generally easy to read and will be appreciated by anyone interested in Da Ponte, Italian opera or the political intrigues of life in 18th century Vienna. Certainly a special interest book, but one that is an fascinating read.on Mozart, that these three masterpieces would be substantially different than what we know today.

It contains an excellent classification list of Mozarts' works by category and also a numerical list by Kochel Numbers. Each chapter has a sizeable list of related notes in the back of the book and the bibliography is also extensive.<br /><br />Although the book is informative and easy to read, I found it a bit repetitious at times (i.e. discussion of Leopold's prolonged influence over Mozart, and also, the ever present preoccupation with money). There were a couple chapters on the meaning of Mozart's music as to how it was affected by events of the time that seem to me to contains a lot of subjective conjecture.<br /><br />On a personal note, I was hoping for some detailed accounts of Mozart's relationship with Saleri and especially, his librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte (who did the libretto for Cosi, Figaro and Don Giovanni). However, although both men are mentioned in this work, there is sparse information on their involvement with Mozart.<br /><br />All in all and enjoyable work.	2002-12-23
