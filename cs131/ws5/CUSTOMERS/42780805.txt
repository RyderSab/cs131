Though the book was throroughly interesting and well worth while, it seemed like the authors were criticizing postmodernism not only for factual errors, but also for the general atmosphere and laid-back intellecutualism, elitism, and emphasis of fluidity and triviality.  As far as I can see, Sokal and Bricmont just aren't the right temperament for the postmodern text.<br />As much as we agree with Sokal and Bricmont that people should know what they are talking about, if they are going to act proffesionally when doing so, I think that the creative associations that are drawn by postmodernists are, many times, quite insightful and edifying.  Just because there is no strict logical connection between the under-development of fluid mechanics and masculinism doesn't mean that we can make similar edifying associations.<br />But, over all, I think it was a good read.  And, we should be careful and respectful when using scientific jargon, and not just use it for the sake of looking knowledgable and important.	2002-01-17
US	42780805	R1AIDTFAVCGRA6	0691020167	56996744	Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature	Books	4	32	36	N	N	Anti-essentialism &amp; Anti-realism	This book is one of Rorty's ealier works, and, thus, he is still more &quot;analytic&quot; in his approach.  The basic purposes of the book are (1) why it is wrong to speak of coming to a knoweldge of the truth by means of our glassy essence *mirroring* reality and (2) how can we continue philosophy after we have gotten rid of the post-Cartesian epistemological binary opposition.<br />Rorty makes repeated attacks on the correspondence theory of truth.  Furthermore, he ties in his anti-essentialism into this in such a way that if you stand with him in denying the naive realist epistemology, you will begin be unable to see why people speak of &quot;essence&quot; or the ding-an-sich vs. it's representation.  Rorty does not wish to make us into individualistic relativists who believe that however it is that we are appeared to defines what is true.  Rather, he wants us to forget about the whole search for objective ahistorical truth--&quot;Truth&quot; that transcends our contingency.  Also, Rorty engages in a tireless critique of the ocular metaphor that has pervaded Western philosophy from the beginning.<BR>So, truth becomes, ceteris paribus, what our peers will let us get away with saying.  This seems at least half-Wittgensteinian (of course, depending on how you interpret LW).  In the process of deconstructing Western philosophy as the search for transcendental truth, Rorty uses, most notably, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Dewey.<br />Rorty's answer to the second issue dealt with in the book is that philosophers should try to &quot;continue a conversation.&quot;  Forget about metaphysics and all other metanarratives.  We must guide ourselves by &quot;our lights&quot;.  Philosophy is more about settling disputes peaceably (thus inscreasing solidarity) and enjoying ourselves.  Philosophy is just another language game, like science, poetry, etc.  There is nothing that puts the philosopher in access to more basic or fundamental knowledge and truth.  Rather, he is just goodat playing a particular language game.<br />Personally, despite Rorty's claims otherwise, I see this all as just another form of social relativism.  If a society achieves solidarity on an issue, there really isn't much one can say against it from a Rortian view, if we were a part of that society.  But, as Westerners, we might have a lot of things to say.  This is all connected with what is later developed by Rorty into Ethnocentrism.  Basically, because we can't get out of our own bodies, and transcend ourselves, all we can do is speak from where we are.  And, this &quot;where we are&quot; is just a contingent, situated whatever that will no longer be in but a little while.	2001-12-21

One of the most interesting things about reading the book was being able to see the great importance of the Masons and other secret societies.  The whole three men and five men cell groups that even the Al Qaeda now use started then.  Taking us through that horrible French revolution, Billington bombards the reader with so much information that all seems so tremendously important, that you feel bad that you can't remember all of it.  And, of course, the Marxists take center-stage in recent history of revolutionary philosophy.  Unfortunately, Billington only has enough space to take us to the Russian communist revolution.  One gets the impresion that the whole idea of global, organized terrorism started with the Marxists.<br />I think this book will really change the way you see history, and present day secret-societies, terrorist groups, and Marxists.	2001-11-29

Plantinga. Plato certainly has many similar ideas to those of the Christian philosophers and theologians. Both Plato and the Augustinian tradition, as interpreted by Hoitenga, hold to the presence of a priori knowledge in man. For the Calvinist, this a priori knowledge includes the sensus divinitatis, inter alia.<br />Hoitenga, along with Plantinga, define knowledge as &quot;justified true belief&quot;. Personally I don't like that perspective. But, it is nonetheless an edifying one. Hoitenga interprets Plato's Theaetetus as suggesting a &quot;justified true belief&quot; approach. With acquaintance as an adaquate condition for justification, Hoitenga proposes that belief in God is rational and justified. Furthermore, it is properly basic. But, that is from Hoitenga's discussion of Plantinga--with whom he seems to be in almost total agreement concerning epistemology and metaphyscs.<br />As a basic introduction, I think it was good. I found it very educational and helpful. The scholarship is also quite good. If it were not for the fact that I disagreed with a couple of the things he said, I might very well have given it 5 stars. We need more books like this, but, I wish there would be more solidarity among Christians, or even reformed Christians. Unfortunately, it seems that Protestants must always be protesting.	2001-10-27

The questions dealt with (and most importantly the general approach) in the book is that of the old-fashioned logocentric sort.<br />Nash does have some good explanations of Plato's and Aristotle's philosophy that I found helpful.  But, every subject is dealt with only very shortly.  Perhaps Nash puts the most effort and time into logic and logically possible worlds.  Though that is interesting, I find it somewhat disappointing, too.  This book has basically nothing about 20'th century philosophy, except for a tiny bit about decontructionists.  One of my main problems with this is that Nash is a Clarkian in his epistemology.  Beware of that when you read it.  For those of you who are used to reading more open-ended up-to-date stuff, this will definately strike you as ...-retentive.<br />But, I would recommend this to any Christian who is interested in a general introduction to Christian thought.  And, Nash has a good, though brief, introduction to the latest in anti-evolutionary thought.  I found this book helpful, though not necessarily \\"nice\\".	2001-10-10

He seeks to introduce the reader to a Trinitarian approach to interpreting the Bible. He comes up with a whole bunch of triads, which are very similar to Frame's triad in the _Doctrine of the Knowledge of God_. With the triads of purpose, imaging, etc. Poythress shows the analogical nature of human knowledge and language. Of course, the human body and psyche, I believe, are also analogically related to the Trinitarian God.  Also, Poythress gets much from Kenneth L. Pikes work (and triangles).<BR>Overall, I think it is very much worthwhile. I was surprised at how *Biblical* Poythress was. He recognized equally and fairly the dangers of both postmodenrism and modernism. This is a good read if you want to know more about the Trinity. If you want a more detailed, longer, and more technical form of this, there is Poythress' *The Supremcy of God in Interpretation* (available, I think, from WTS [215-886-099]).<BR>The reason that I only give it 4 stars is because I found the discussions among Dottie Doctrinalist, Amy Affermationist, Oliver Objectivist, etc. very annoying. They were unnecessary, I think. But, you may find them helpfull. Yet another reason that I didn't quite enjoy the book was that *every* diagram in it was 2D. Squares, triangles, circles, they are all 2D. The world, God's creation, is always 3 dimentional! 2D objects feel unreal and less personal. Well, if these type of things don't bother you, you may find it to be a five star book.	2001-08-28

Sears, as always, has done a great job in presenting the battle of Antietam creek and the generals who participated in it.  There is just the right balance between details and big-picture views, between little stories and big stories.  Sears helps the reader to relive the battle from both sides.  He gives a fair-sided approach to both armies and generals.<br />This book showed me the importance of the battle.  The battle was very important in the history of the war.  For the South it was a failure.  Only a couple hundred recruits were mustered in Maryland for the Army of Northern Virginia.  The South would have to try another invasion sometime later.  At the Battle of Antietam, George McClellan, a slow but brilliant general, almost captured Lee's whole army.  Had it not been for A. P. Hill's timely arrival, Lee might have been forced to surrender.<br />On the Northern side, there was great providence at work for them.  A copy of Lee's general order showing the detailed orders for each division of the army fell into the hands of McClellan.  McClellan acted quickly (at least for him) and soon had Lee in a desperate situation.  Lee had the Potomac river behind him.  Well, if you want to know the rest of the story and all the interesting details, get the book.<br />In my opinion, Sears is the best writer on Civil War battles.  If he write a book on the Civil War, get it, by all means (well, not *all*).  Sears shows the brilliance of both McClellan and Lee (of course, Longstreet, Jackson, the Hills, etc. also).  You NEED this book, if you are a Civil War buff.	2001-08-20

I liked it.  But, I warn you that it is FULL of LITTLE details about the battle.  If that's what you are looking for, get it.  What is hard to grasp in this book is the &quot;big picture.&quot;  This is partially due to the poor maps provided.  If you can, you make use of other maps, so that you don't just get a whole bunch of tiny details.  You need a big map of the whole general area with the place and road names.  And, it would be nice to have maps that showed troop movement.  If it were not for this lack of maps and the &quot;big picture&quot; part of the battle, I would have given it 5 stars.  Another thing.  This book does not have too much about the generals and what kind of people they were.  It concentrates more on the rank and file dirty-work soldiers.	2001-08-20

With his best generals.  This is the pinacle of the Confederacy.  Times were at their worst in the North, and at their best in the South.  After Lincoln's emancipation proclomation, the soldiers were in gloomy spirits.  Furthermore, because of the battle of Federicksburg as well as the muddy march, the Army of the Potomac was getting about 200 deserters a day, by the time Hooker took over the army.<br />Sears shows how great and brilliant Hooker actually was.  Sears shows the reader how it was Hooker who revived the Yankee army.  Hooker did everything right.  He had a well equiped, well fed, large army just a few months after he took over.  Only a McClellan could have done better.  Hooker even made a perfect plan for the campaign.<br />But, God had mercy on Lee and the South.  Lee took such a daring move that it was totally unanticipated.  Sears will show you how the little details added up to make such a catastrophy out of the perfect plan and army.  One will find new respect for Hooker after reading this.  But, one will find even greater respect for Lee!  Read it!  You won't know otherwise.  This is one of the most interesting battles of the Civil War.  And, it wasn't so bloody.  One wonders why, though, God decided to kill Jackson in such a way.  It seemed so unnecessary....  Well, my opinion is READ THE BOOK IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY!  It is the best on the subject.	2001-08-20

I never liked time-machines anyway.  Also, in the 1860s people had the technology to make AK-47s.  They just didn't have the idea.

This book has proven to be a landmark in not only the philosophy of science, but in practically the whole world of Western philosophy.  The book is tremendously well researched, and is very pursuasive.  Basically, Kuhn tries to disprove the myth of linear progression in the Naturwissenschaften, positing the theory of paradigms and paradigm shifts.  The paradigm shift is likened to the Gestalt switch.  To me, Kuhn's use of the word paradigm made me think of Wittgenstein's term &quot;language game.&quot;  There are some differences, but I think that it is good to relate the two as one reads through the book.<br />I have found this book to be a great use in papers that I have written since my reading of it.  One should keep in mind, however, the extensive discussions that have arisen after its initial publication.  If this is the only thing you have read about Kuhn's theory of the structure of scientific revolutions, be careful that you don't look stupid in front of people who have studied all the subtle and complicated discussions that have come about in response to the first edition of this book.	2001-08-10

The traditional problems in epistemology led to the binary oppositions of Descartes, Kant, etc. The scholastic &quot;quod&quot; vs. &quot;quo&quot; distinction, the Cartesian subject-object dualism, and the Kantian ding-an-sich versus appearence dualism have been the centers of a considerable amount of debate in the history of epistemological kibitzing. Now, with Sir Karl Popper in the lead, some philosophers have set out to solve the problems of epistemology by approaching it in an evolutionary way! To me, this is all hogwash. I say, prove the theory of evolution BEFORE you use it as the basis for an epistemology! Show us the billions of missing links! Explain to us how in the world language came out of non-verbal life-forms. But, before that, how on earth did life appear from non-life? Is the theory of evolution falsifiable? NO! Actually, what I really want to know is, how did something come from nothing. It is an unfalsifiable presupposition. Furthermore, it is taken for granted that nothing comes from nothing, now.

If one who doesn't know too much about the battle and the generals (as persons), then one WILL come away with a greatly warped and false view of the battle, it's importance, and the relative importance of each of the generals and officers who actually fought the REAL battle (not some dramatized, sentimental, fictitious battle in the imagination of some dreamer).<br />The worst thing about this book is that it SEEMS to be somewhat historical. But it's not. Nobody knows who gave the command for the charge of the 20'th Maine, but it wasn't Chamberlain. And, their position was hardly as important as the book made it seem. There were plenty of reinforcements from the V or VI corps lying around to plug up any break through in the Union lines. The important part of the battle was already over on the first day! The rest was almost needless and futile blood shed, on the part of the South (though I say it with the advantage of hindsight and knowledge of the Yankee army that Gen.

But, I am amazed at how conveniently Rorty fits the philosophies of Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and others into his pragmatic ethnocentrism.  It seems that he is using them to help make his own philosophy more compelling, rather than just telling stories about them.  But, of course he would do that.  Well, anyway, don't be decieved.  He is using them for the purpose of propagating his own views.  Also, he has a &quot;straw-god&quot; argument against the God of the Bible.  When he speaks of &quot;type A entities,&quot; all he is talking about is a primus inter pares, not a Transcendental.  Interesting kibitzing, though.  A good read for philosophasters like myself.	2001-08-04

As interesting and successful as Rorty is, he fails to make me feel comfortable identifying myself with the postmodernist liberals.  Rorty holds to some sort of a skepticism.  At best, he doesn't seem to care about any sort of representationalistic epistemology.  Also, he tries to reduce any representationlistic epistemology to a simplistic &quot;mirror&quot; epistemology.  To me, that is a straw-man argument. <br /> Despite Rorty's claims not to be a relativist, I would assert that he is.  No doubt, we all, in the end, use arguments that could be accused of being a mere petitio principii (i.e. begging the question).  However, when one is an evolutionaristic anti-essentialist at the same time, one cannot escape cultural relativism, at best.  There is no common ground among language games, according to Rorty's philosophy.  If so, there is no moral obligation for one to play one language game, or hold to one web of belief, as opposed to another. <br /> Well, anyway, it was a good read.  Rorty is definitely another one of those innovative and interesting postmodernists (along with others like Foucault and Derrida).  One difference, though, is that Rorty is much more optimistic than his peers.  Of course, this optimism is groundless, though not reasonless.	2001-08-04

It is quite short, but still not trivial, by any means.  This book will help you see the importance of eschatology in your practical everyday life.	2001-08-04

Any reformed, orthodox Protestant should find this a great read.  It is fairly easy reading, though at the same time thought-provoking.  The perspectivalism that Frame posits allows one a more three dimmentional thought process, I think.  Frame goes through the doctrine of how we, as mere humans, know God.  Though philosophy tends to bounce back and forth between anti-abstractionism and abstractionism (the One and the Many), Frame presents us with a refreshing Trinitarian answer to epistemology.  I think this would be greatly beneficial to all people, Christian or not.	2001-08-04
