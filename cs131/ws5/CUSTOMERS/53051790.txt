After playing the D20 adventure, \\"Death in Freeport,\\" my interest was piqued in the Unspeakable One and the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign.  As it turns out, both were inspired by Hastur and the Yellow Sign.  So I decided to go to the source and read the original stories that helped craft the mythology of the Great Old One known as Hastur and his crazy book, \\"The King in Yellow.\\"<br /><br />Briefly, Hastur is both a place and a being.  He/it is loosely connected to the cities of Carcosa, Yhtill, and Alar.  Hastur and Alar are divided in a battle of succession.  Yhtill is a city of the past, while Carcosa is a haunted city of the future. All of the cities are near Lake Hali. The cities are on a planet near the star Aldebaran in the Hyades, a planet with two moons and two suns.  The inhabitants may be black or white (sources disagree).<br /><br />What they all agree on is that the Phantom of Truth appears during the siege between the two cities.  The Phantom wears a mask and tells everyone else to wear a mask to avoid the appearance of the King in Yellow, who will ultimately usurp all royal successors thereafter.<br /><br />So everyone wears a mask, including the jaded and bitter Queen Camilla, her clueless daughter Cassilda, and her two sons Thale and Uoht.  The plan is that by wearing masks, everyone will be saved from the King in Yellow's inevitable appearance.  But the King in Yellow easily thwarts the Phantom of Truth, and he thereafter declares that everyone must wear a mask as well as the yellow sign, a squiggly three-armed symbol.<br /><br />Sometimes Hastur is described as the King in Yellow, sometimes he's described as the Phantom of Truth, and sometimes he looks an awful lot like Cthulhu.<br /><br />Oh yeah, someone transcribed all of this down into a play.  If you read it or watch it, you go mad.  Or you slowly get drawn into the play.  Or the characters from the play come after you.  It's complicated.<br /><br />The Second Edition of the Hastur Cycle contains 14 different stories, all of them collected by Robert M. Price into one volume.  They are loosely connected by the mythology of Hastur.  I'll try to elaborate on each story and make sense of it all...without going mad.<br /><br />\\"Haita the Shepherd\\" and \\"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\\" are both by Ambrose Bierce, he of the \\"Devil's Dictionary.\\"  In \\"Haita the Shepherd\\", a shepherd struggles in a relentless pursuit of a beautiful woman, who turns out to be an ideal.  It's a bittersweet commentary on life.  In \\"Inhabitant,\\" we discover that Bierce invented the Sixth Sense plot twist before M. Night Shyamalan. They're both short and neither are particularly riveting to a modern audience.<br /><br />HASTUR:  In \\"Haita,\\" Hastur is a benevolent deity of shepherds that Haita prays to.  Occasionally, Hastur does nice things for Haita.  But he doesn't have much of a role.  In \\"Inhabitant,\\" we have...well, an inhabitant of the city of Carcosa.  He refers to Hali as a person, not a lake.<br /><br />Robert W. Chambers wrote the next two stories, \\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" and \\"The Yellow Sign.\\"  In \\"Repairer,\\" the play known as The King in Yellow appears for the first time.  It establishes the subsequent madness that ensues by any who read The King in Yellow, as evidenced by the narrator of \\"The Repairer of Reputations.\\"  What's not immediately clear is that this story takes place in the future, where suicide chambers are government sanctioned.  The future twist muddles the story a bit, as the setting isn't relevant to the plot.  But it keeps you guessing.  \\"Yellow,\\" on the other hand, is just an out-and-out creep fest, with a zombie who keeps muttering, \\"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\\" Good stuff, dramatic endings, and in both cases the characters aren't yammering about the horrors they witnessed from the safety of the afterword, a trait all too often found in Lovecraft and his imitators.<br /><br />HASTUR: These two stories lay the foundation that reading the King in Yellow drives you bonkers.  They both hint at what happens in the first act of the play, which involves the Phantom of Truth.  And this, unfortunately, is where we learn about the hearse-driver zombie.  He will be rammed into just about every story afterwards, even where he doesn't belong.  But that's not Chambers' fault.<br /><br />\\"The River of Night's Dreaming,\\" by Karl Edward Wagner, is a decidedly modern take on the King in Yellow mythos.  It's scarier than the others, but a little less creative in forcing the main character (a young woman who has escaped prison) into the story itself, in a sort of Gothica/Misery movie scenario.  One character refers to \\"The King in Yellow\\" as \\"vintage porno,\\" and that's an adequate description of this story.  I felt a little dirty after reading it.<br /><br />HASTUR:  Unlike the other stories in this volume, \\"River\\" makes no attempt to expand or include the King in Yellow.  Instead, it focuses on repressed Victorian desires. Which is a bit of an assumption in the first place that anything in the King in Yellow has to do with the Victorian-era.<br /><br />That brings us to \\"More Light\\" by James Blish, the crown jewel of the collection.  As a story, it's not very entertaining.  It's basically a guy reading \\"The King in Yellow\\" on a dare.  It also establishes a trope that gets old fast: the narrator refers to Lovecraft's writings as if they were real.  Oh, the irony!<br /><br />HASTUR: This is the mother of all Hastur resources.  It gives us almost the entire play of The King in Yellow.  The story itself is bland, but the narrative of the play is fantastic and incorporates all the elements from the other stories.  One thing that does get a bit silly is the insistence by authors of including EVERY bit of trivia about the Hastur mythos.  The undead hearse driver from \\"The Yellow Sign\\" isn't just in the story, he's the Phantom of Truth.  In \\"The Yellow Sign\\" someone remarks that the hearse driver's finger broke off (a consequence of being a zombie) and sure enough, it's mentioned in the play.  If anything, the play is almost too thorough.  But we'll take it, as Blish manages to put the various quotes together into a cohesive whole that is rather freaky.<br /><br />The Hastur Cycle begins to stray with \\"The Novel of the Black Seal\\" by Arthur Machen.  It's nearly unreadable, because of the stilted Victorian prose.  Suffice it to say that the story involves the \\"little people\\" and their worship of the Yellow Sign, but takes such a long time to get there that you no longer care about the ending.<br /><br />HASTUR: None.  Price posits that this story served as the inspiration for \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\" by H.P. Lovecraft. Which is a bit of a tangent, as \\"Whisperer\\" has almost nothing to do with Hastur.<br /><br />\\"Whisperer in the Darkness\\" is one of those stories that would actually be more entertaining if it were updated.  Most of it takes place between two characters exchanging letters, with one of the authors continually updating his pen pal.  It would play much better as an email exchange.  It's even a little creepy, given that it deals with intelligent lobster fungi called Mi-Go.<br /><br />HASTUR: Lovecraft's sole contribution mentions the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign and Hastur in passing. Supposedly, \\"there is a whole secret cult of evil men...devoted to the purpose of tracking [the Mi-Go] down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions.\\" Presumably those monstrous powers are Hastur.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Price now takes the connection of Mi-Go and goes crazy with it, spiraling off into a series of short stories that are focused on them instead of Hastur.  So we have \\"Documents in the Case of Elizabeth Akeley,\\" by Richard A. Lupoff, which is essentially a sequel to \\"Whisperer.\\"  It's followed by two short stories about humans visiting the home planet of the Mi-Go, called Yuggoth (or, as we call it, \\"Pluto\\").  They're fast reads but are wasted space foranyone who wants to learn more about Hastur.<br /><br />We finally get back to Hastur with \\"The Return of Hastur\\" by August Derleth.  Reading this, I discovered a few things: 1) Derleth's narrative leaves much to be desired, and 2) he apparently thinks a Godzilla vs. King Kong type fight between Hastur and Cthulhu makes for scary stuff.  It really, really doesn't.<br /><br />HASTUR: Derleth helps lay the groundwork for the Unspeakable Oath, gives Hastur the title \\"He Who is Not to be Named,\\" demonstrates what happens to the Chosen of Hastur, and (sadly) tries to make Hastur the half-brother of Cthulhu; like we need some big family tree of ancient horrors to make it all make sense.  Bless Derleth's heart, he does try hard.<br /><br />\\"The Feaster from Afar\\" turns Hastur into a flying boogeyman.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it contains the noteworthy death of a character.  As opposed to a character safely talking about how he narrowly escaped mind-rending horror (but is all too eager to tell us about it).<br /><br />HASTUR: Hastur sounds a lot like Cthulhu: all tentacles with a taste for brains.<br /><br />\\"Tatters of the King\\" by Lin Carter contains all kinds of interesting tidbits about Hastur.  It's actually three fragments, including a poem titled \\"Litany to Hastur,\\" a \\"Carcosa Story about Hali\\" and \\"The King in Yellow\\" in verse.<br /><br />HASTUR: Carter connects Byakhee to Hastur in \\"Tatters.\\"  Then we follow Hali (the guy, not the lake, harkening back to Bierce) as a necromancer trying to undo the curse of the undead in Carcosa.  Hastur is the Thing in the Lake (he apparently sleeps in it), and the citizens practice human sacrifice to him.  The verse is noteworthy for Price's intrusion as editor...he actually ADDS verse to the parts that are missing from Carter, who in turn took it from Blish.  I thought editors were supposed to edit, not write...and certainly not provide completely new verse into someone else's work.  But I digress.<br /><br />Ultimately, The Hastur Cycle is an important but flawed survey of Hastur mythology.  It's much less about Hastur than it is about Price's personal tastes on what stories influenced Lovecraft...as if the entire mythology's importance hinges upon Lovecraft's slim contribution.  What's missing are other stories by Chambers, such as \\"The Mask\\" and the \\"The Court of the Dragon.\\" Also missing are John Tynes' contributions, which have become part of the Hastur mythology mostly through Chaosium's support.<br /><br />Did I mention it contains the majority of \\"The King in Yellow?\\"  Read it, if you dare...s finger broke off (a consequence of being a zombie) and sure enough, it's mentioned in the play.

I have a long history with Bill the Galactic Hero, but it took me two decades to read it.  Stick with me; this is relevant to the review.<br /><br />I first saw Bill the Galactic Hero in my local Waldenbooks as a teen in the `80s.  I had spiked hair and wore parachute pants.  I laughed out loud after flipping through some of the chapters and decided that I would buy it.  When I went to purchase it, I suddenly realized I didn't have enough money.  So I put it back, determined to buy it later.<br /><br />When I walked past the shop clerk, I was accosted.  He asked me to empty my pockets.  He thought I was stealing books (STEALING BOOKS!).  I was horrified and furious.  And no, I didn't steal anything.  But I sure as heck wasn't going to give that store my money.<br /><br />Two decades passed and I forgot just about everything about the book, including the title.  I just knew the character had a generic name and was really messed up--something was wrong with his arms. Then one day, while browsing Amazon.com, I stumbled across Bill the Galactic Hero.  I put it on my wish list and one year later Bill and I were reacquainted.<br /><br />What's even more interesting is that I live in Harry Harrison's place of birth, Stamford, CT.  I'm not sure if I should be proud or if Harry should be concerned.<br /><br />Anyway, I learned a few things right away about Bill the Galactic Hero, just by judging the book by its cover. None of the artists commissioned to create the covers actually read the book.  How do I know this?  Because I read the frickin' thing. Take a look: [...]<br /><br />The cover I have shows Chingers (the \\"bad\\" guys) as seven-inch tall lizards with ray guns.  Only in the book, they have four arms, not two.  Poor Bill does end up with two right arms, but they are NOT on the same side (one cover gives Bill two left arms AND puts them on the wrong side).  We know this because of one of the funniest lines in the entire book.  I'll let you decide for yourself when you read it.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead.  The plot takes place in a far future where robots are plentiful and people use a fake curse word for everything (\\"bowb\\"). Basically, Bill is a naive farm boy on a rural planet who gets forcibly pressed into military service.  He ends up being a \\"fusetender,\\" trained to change out fuses on a gigantic spaceship that he has never actually seen the outside of.  In fact, Bill doesn't know anything about ship-to-ship combat and instead has to interpret what's going on by temperature changes in the room.  When the shields go up, it stops everything from going in and out--including heat--such that the fuestenders strip down just to survive the sweltering temperatures. That slight rumble in the deck plates?  That's a torpedo firing.  You get the picture.<br /><br />This is probably the most interesting part of the book, as we see war as it truly is...boring, interspersed by horrifying moments of sheer terror.  Despite the fact that Bill isn't on the front lines (and in a space war, where ARE the front lines?), he's still at risk of dying.  Which leads up to how Bill loses his left arm and gains an additional right arm. It's a lot funnier than it sounds.<br /><br />The plot spirals from there.  Unfortunately, the book's not as engaging when Bill is away from the military.  Harrison is at his excoriating best when he's blasting the jaded, backstabbing, monotonous culture that is military bureaucracy.  Bill learns fast and we learn with him: War is hell, and then you lose a limb.  And get it replaced with one that doesn't fit right.<br /><br />That said, the book is harsh on its characters.  Just about everyone Bill meets, even those characters that seem to have an actual plot significance, die at the drop of a hat. They get blown up, immolated, shot, beaten to death, or eaten by a snake.  Bill's world is brutal, but it moves so fast that you might have difficulty caring about who is who.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of real scienceinterspersed throughout the humor, especially the ridiculous problems of waste disposal on planet Helior.  When I described the problems to my wife (an environmental studies major), she pointed out that the book must have been written in the `60s. It never occurred to me that the book was that old, but sure enough, checking the originally copyright confirmed that Bill the Galatic Hero was written at a time when the draft was in full effect and most people couldn't conceive of any possible future that didn't end in a natural or man-made holocaust. Bill the Galactic Hero is truly a product of its times.<br /><br />But it's still pretty funny.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book ends on an extremely sour, angry note.  By then, Bill's transformation is complete. The number of sequels that came afterwards surprised me.  Bill the Galactic Hero was written with a point in mind: that the military is a horrible place.  Once Harrison got that point across (and believe you me, he gets it across), you have to wonder where he will take Bill next.<br /><br />I imagine I would have appreciated this book much more if I was in the military or a teenager.  In either case, it was certainly an educational experience for my inner writer.  For anyone who wants to glorify war (Harrison's looking at you, Heinlein) in word, song or deed, Bill the Galactic Hero will shamelessly mock them until they change their mind.<br /><br />And if not, well they were stupid bowbs anyway.e a bit of real science interspersed throughout the humor, especially the ridiculous problems of waste disposal on planet Helior.

War of the Worlds is back in vogue, thanks to two folks you might have heard of: Spielberg and Cruise. Thanks to their efforts, the threat of aliens blowing us up for no good reason at all is once again on our minds. Instead of an attack from above, the movie switched gears to put the killing machines right in our midst. Despite that change, the concept is the same: big fish eat little fish and space is a huge pond.<br /><br />This sourcebook is meant to bring the setting to life by drawing straight from the source material. This means that it requires a bit of updating for some campaigns unless they are set in the Victorian-era (ooh, maybe D20 Adventure!). It's also a dual-statted book for both the Action! System and the D20 system. Besides the story itself (available for free here [...] there's information on how to play the setting of War of the Worlds as well as rules on weapons, equipment, alien war machines, and of course the Martians themselves.<br /><br />LIKED: There's nothing quite like getting a blow-by-blow of H.G. Well's original novel. The authors are obviously passionate about the novel and closely adhere to the events in the tale. They also provide information for branching off from the main storyline to create an entire campaign. Throughout, the entire book is illustrated with appropriate black-and-white artwork. It's a handsome book.<br /><br />DISLIKED: Unfortunately, this is one of those books that gives dual-statted books a bad name. It's not really \\"dual\\" at all. Sure, there are D20 stats listed...in Chapter Three: The Martians. Prior to that point, all the rules for new skills, the military, weapons of the era, and the war machines themselves are ONLY for the Action! system. This is a heresy in the publishing world. Want to tick off D20 gamers and ensure they don't buy anything else that's dual-statted? Give D20 short shrift in the book. I wanted stats for the Martian war machines dammit!<br /><br />A pity. It's a professional book that's tightly focused on the Action! system. In that regard, it's much more useful.

You get that impression that the original creators were frustrated by editors who prevented them from implementing their idealized version of the game. Thus, their D20 products are ultimately their ideas, often raw. Sort of a director's cut of \\"what I would do if *I* ran WOTC.<br /><br />So here we have Stan! and The Game Mechanics putting together their own book as a supplement to D20 Modern. It's unfair to compare just about anyone else's work to this book, because a lot of these folks worked on the D20 Modern Core Rulebook to begin with. When you've got all that talent, odds are that the book will be good.<br /><br />LIKED: The Modern Player's Companion does not disappoint. It has fantastic art and layout along with clean, readable text. We get a smattering of occupations and then we hop to the first of many gems in the book: class combos vs. advanced classes. See, the point of D20 Modern's class system is that it's not supposed to be thought of as a class system. Rather, it's a system to regulate power increases. Thus, you don't join a lawyer advanced class, you join a combination of Smart, Charismatic, and Dedicated levels so the lawyer can do what he does best...sue the pants off of people. It's a subtle concept but an important one, perfectly illustrated in this book.<br /><br />Feats and equipment round out characters. Most of it isn't innovative, but was so common that you didn't notice it was missing from D20 Modern. Which is why anyone who plays D20 Modern needs this book.<br /><br />It also includes equipment packages, an excellent means of kitting out a character without having to go shopping each time (a godsend for GMs!).<br /><br />DISLIKED: The advanced classes cover the gamut of archetypes, from the Survivalist to the Profiler, Enforcer to the awkwardly named Opinion Maker. \\"Politico\\" would have been better, but it was used as the title of an occupation.<br /><br />But that's a minor quibble. Really, the only problem with The Modern Player's Companion is that it covers a lot of generic territory. It's not going to overwhelm you with crazy new feats or weird powers. The book is meant to patch the holes in D20 Modern, and in that respect it achieves its goal. But then, what did you expect from the people who wrote the original game?would have been better, but it was used as the title of an occupation. <br /> <br />But that's a minor quibble.

It has since been updated to D20 Future in a series of separate installments. This book contains all of that information (pre-D20 Future update) condensed into 118 pages of sci-fi goodness. Back in the day, compatibility with Dungeons & Dragons (and the now defunct Dragon*Star setting) was deemed necessary. These days it might seem quaint (\\"aww, look, they have alignments!\\"). So Blood and Space can be used with both D20 Fantasy and D20 Modern.<br /><br />LIKED: There are plenty of feats here, many of them having to do with spaceship combat. Pilot-type feats were lacking in D20 Modern, so it's great to see them fleshed out here. There's lots of equipment, although in a science fiction campaign this is probably the trickiest to choose from. Progress Levels in D20 Future helped provide a baseline, but all the options are here, including the Tesla Rifle and Orbital Insertion Armor.<br /><br />Speaking of orbital insertion, there are also complete starship design rules that were sorely missing from D20 Modern. You pick the hull, engine, defensive/offensive systems and you're good to go. This is a significant chunk of the book (pages 48-70). Then there are rules for crews and starship combat. There's so much here that it's almost like playing an entirely new game. Given that the vehicle rules for D20 Modern are lacking, this is a Good Thing .<br /><br />After detailing a bunch of space hazards, there are a host of sample ships. Which is a good thing, because I'm not so sure I'd want to build too many ships on my own. They are all professionally illustrated. As always, the layout and design perfectly matches the theme.<br /><br />DISLIKED: As a result of its broad compatibility, there are a host of 20-level classes that might seem incongruous for a Modern campaign. You can pretty much divide them in half without effort, condensing each class's powers into 10 levels. But still, that might annoy folks looking for a D20 Modern plug-in. All the archetypes are here, from the Doctor to the Hotshot, the Marine to the Mercenary, the Smuggler to the Starship Officer. There are also Prestige (Advanced for you Modern folk) classes, with the obligatory Colonial Marine. To blow up aliens that are black and look like bugs and eat your brains.<br /><br />For better or worse, the classes are tightly integrated to the setting. You can't just use the Starship Commander prestige class without modification, because it has the Voice of Command ability. This ability involves issuing Orders. Orders are part of the starship combat rules unique to this supplement.<br /><br />I'm very picky about my skills.

DMs should read it, players should not.<br /><br />Death in Freeport is an updated 3.5 adventure that won an ENnie Award and an Origins Award for Best RPG Adventure. Given that kind of accolades, you can expect an adventure of high quality.<br /><br />What's interesting about Freeport is that although it's nominally presented as a pirate setting (with an 18th-century feel to it), the adventure has almost nothing to do with the setting.<br /><br />Basically, an alien being on an exploratory mission possesses a librarian of the Temple of Knowledge (Lucius) in Freeport. Lucius promptly leaves the Temple and disappears for several years, only to return with no memory of his past. He tries to put it all behind him, but eventually his dark past catches up with him.<br /><br />No wait, that's not entirely true. We have no idea what Lucius experiences. We only know that a secret cult of serpent people and human cultists are attempting to bring back their dark god, the god of the Yellow Sign. And that the leader of the cult suspects that Lucius might have some tie to their dark god. So they capture and torture Lucius, ultimately leading the adventurers on a path to retrieve him.<br /><br />Not much in the way of pirates, huh?<br /><br />This adventure is meant to be an introduction to Freeport, but I tweaked it for my Arcanis campaign to support characters up to 5th level by replacing the 1 HD serpent people with 7 HD Ssanu. Reality is, the two are one and the same: Freeport is a \\"shared universe\\" and does exist in Onara (the world of Arcanis), so I used the Arcanis version of the serpent people. In that regard it's a great addition to the Arcanis setting and nicely sets up the events in the Living Arcanis adventures Serpentine Path and the Secret of Semar.<br /><br />The adventure begins with the PCs stepping off a boat and being assaulted by a press gang to help reinforce the \\"favor\\" of Freeport. I had a new player joining us so I used the event to introduce him to the group as well as the campaign and it worked well. From there, the PCs searched Lucius' house for clues. This leads them to Captain Scarbelly, an orc captain of the Bloody Vengeance, and depending on how things go, ultimately to the Temple of Knowledge (known as the Temple of Althares in the Arcanis setting). After being rebuffed by an irritating Temple bureaucrat known as Milos, the PCs are attacked by the Yellow Shield gang. A note on the Yellow Shield leader leads the PCs to a stoolie named Enzo, who in turn leads them to the cult's lair. Then it's a battle to find Lucius, fighting cultists, serpent people, and the high priest of the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign.<br /><br />LIKED: This is a city adventure with a plot flexible enough to keep pushing players along. Pramas knows what he's doing and recognizes that sometimes PCs don't get every clue. So if a clue doesn't show up through the PCs being clever, it shows up by the DM chucking it at them (e.g., you can intimidate the Yellow Shield gang leader into talking about his contact or you can grab a pouch with directions off of his dead body). Far too many adventures lack this sort of clarity and leave it to the DM to figure out how to steer PCs back on track.<br /><br />The adventure's tone, which is more about horror than freewheeling pirates, is very Indiana Jones'ish. There are creepy conspiracies, cults, fanatics, and secret lairs. There are equal amounts of problem solving, role-playing, and hacking monsters up. I have a wide variety of playing styles in my game group, and it's a credit to the adventure that none of them were bored.<br /><br />As a DM, I enjoyed playing up the only true pirates in the adventure: Captain Scarbelly and his orc crew. The PCs had a blast sneaking onto the ship and stealing a magical staff under their noses. Too bad the staff has absolutely zilcho to do with the plot (see below for my complaint about that).<br /><br />Despite my gripes below,this adventure is one of the best games I've DMed to date. I already purchased the next adventure in the series. I hope feverishly hopie much of the open plot points (like what really happened to Lucius) gets explained.<br /><br />I really, REALLY enjoyed the unexpected connection to the Call of Cthulhu mythos. On the other hand, it's a bit annoying to discover that the entire adventure is actually culled from another plot entirely. I'm not sure why the adventure doesn't plainly state these connections, but I suspect they involve copyrights. The good news is that you finally have a use for D20 Call of Cthulhu in D&D. The bad news is...well, maybe you were looking for an adventure about pirates, not Cthulhu.<br /><br />DISLIKED: There are definitely some flaws in this adventure that can detract from the enjoyment of the game. I haven't seen any of them pointed out in a review anywhere, which makes me think a lot of folks reviewed this adventure but never played it. So here's what I discovered:<br /><br />First of all, an NPC's glasses are used to connect his disguise from when the PCs first meet him to the big, bad cult leader at the end of the adventure. It's specifically stated that he wears \\"horn-rimmed glasses.\\" Not only does the concept of this character wearing horn-rimmed glasses seem ridiculous and at odds with the creepy theme, the drawing of the character wearing the glasses makes him look like an overweight KKK leader at a rally (p. 17). Scary? Hardly. And given that the main bad guy is a shapeshifter, what the hell is he wearing glasses for anyway? To compensate, I gave the character a lisp, a side effect of poor shapeshifting (in essence, the snake guy in human form doesn't know how to speak Common correctly).<br /><br />It's obvious that Captain Scarbelly has something to side. That something is a staff of defense, a VERY powerful magic item...far too powerful for a party of 1st level to go after. But it's in there anyway and the module makes it a point of getting the PCs to think Lucius is on board the ship. Which is a bit of dirty pool, in my opinion, given that the odds are against the PCs. Fortunately, my group (who was averaging 3-5th level remember) DID get the staff. And then spent much of the game trying to figure out what the staff had to do with the conspiracy.<br /><br />It has absolutely nothing to do with anything. It's a red herring. While I don't mind plot points that can be expanded upon in another campaign, making PCs think that the ship holds something that it doesn't is unfair, especially when the odds are so stacked against them.<br /><br />Enzo's presence is pointless. He exists to connect the PCs to the actual cult lair and was used by the cult to hire the Yellow Shields. However, if this was a test to see if \\"Enzo could be discreet,\\" it has a huge flaw: Enzo's knows where the cult's lair is and can give PCs direction to it. This cult is not all that smart. Still, it does keep the plot moving.<br /><br />Another big problem is that this module is technically a Call of Cthulhu horror adventure. And I don't mean, \\"Inspired by Call of Cthulhu.\\" I mean: it uses creatures, plots, characters and concepts from Call of Cthulhu. The Unspeakable One is actually Hastur, He Who Shall Not be Named. He is worshipped by the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign. We know it's the same Yellow Sign because it's depicted in a picture on page 23. The serpent people are certainly the same degenerate/advanced serpent people depicted in the Cthulhu mythos. We know this because they worship Yig, the same deity mentioned in the mythos. I'm concerned that Lucius was possessed by a Shan (extraplanar bug people who use bodies to go exploring) and therefore has nothing to do with the conspiracy plot other than being part of that whole crazy Cthulhu mythos.<br /><br />In the original mythos, Yig is the deity of the serpent people and it is only when they turn to Tsathoggua that he loses power. In the Freeport version, the serpent people turn from Yig to Hastur instead. Otherwise, the plot is generally the same...there are evil serpent people who now worship the new evil god and those who still worship the at-least-not-as-evil old god.<br /><br />There are a lot of world-altering implications in having Hastur even exist in your campaign. One doesn't just drop him into a game lightly, so DMs should be sure they really want the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign in their game universe. The book Hastur is known for, a play called \\"The King in Yellow,\\" is even in the library (known as \\"The Book of the Unspeakable One\\"). If you don't know anything about the book, it's a lot like the Hellraiser Cube (AKA, the Lament Configuration). Once you read it, you are slowly drawn into Hastur's form of hell known as Carcosa. In this adventure, the book merely inflicts damage on good-aligned beings and drains some Wisdom points.<br /><br />This whole Wisdom-point draining thing is really just another way of threatening the sanity of characters. The sanity rules presented in Call of Cthulhu work better. In fact, your character could well have contact with the Unspeakable One himself in the Initiation Chamber and thus lose some Wisdom permanently. Good stuff, but the mechanics don't support it.<br /><br />The problem with this blending of freewheeling pirates and Cthulhu-style creepiness is that they each have a very distinct theme. Most campaigns probably follow the pirate-style already, but horror is much harder. Trying to make the PCs comprehend how scary the Unspeakable One really is just falls flat; it's sort of like throwing the Cthulhu Mythos into the cantina scene from Star Wars. Would anyone even notice? And would Luke Skywalker really be afraid after what he saw sucking down drinks at the bar?<br /><br />Similarly, PCs accustomed to hacking up lizard men aren't going to find the snake people particularly sinister (especially the cult leader with the 1950s-style glasses). Hastur deserves a lot more build up, a lot more conspiracy, and a lot more respect. And new DMs deserve a lot more coaching about how to play a horror campaign.<br /><br />All told, none of these issues are problematic for an experienced DM.

Poor Roger is down on his luck after being slandered by an incident in which he supposedly sent cardboard blanks to Nonesuch Books.  As a freelancer, he barely scrapes by, and Roger figures hallucinations are part of his downward spiral into homelessness.<br /><br />Believing things can't get possibly worse, Roger has the misfortune of bumping into his old rival, Kevin Matthews.  Kevin's got everything: the money, the fame, and a hot new wife named Julia.  What he doesn't have is talent.  But how?<br /><br />Kevin's success is not without its victims.  Kevin's ex-wife, Donna, was once a fellow artist, but now she's a shell of her beautiful former self.  Eventually, Roger and Donna discover the common link to their misfortune is actually Kevin.<br /><br />After Roger confesses to Kevin that he thought his pictures started coming to life, two people show up with the intent of killing him. As a last desperate measure, Kevin and Elsie end up in one of his paintings. And then things get really wacky...<br /><br />Aaron Allston perfectly nails both the fiscal uncertainty and thrilling creativity of a freelancer, and he takes both to new extremes.  What if an artist could create life just by thinking of it?  And what if the better the artist, the better the life?<br /><br />What ensues is essentially a war of wizards, as Kevin and Roger begin a magical duel to the death that spans cities and paintings. Roger and Donna's paintings consist of futuristic science fiction tropes (flying spy drones, robot clones, and laser rifles) while Kevin's paintings are something out of a Harryhausen flick (ancient Greek heroes, gargoyles, and stone Cyclopes). Along the way, Roger discovers his 30-something lust for a perfect dream girl looks a lot like a fellow mature artist than a clueless nymph.<br /><br />With such limitless possibilities, Allston struggles to contain the plot.  Roger decides to paint an incredibly powerful superhero, only to discover that there's a limit to what he can pull into the real world. And yet Kevin has crystal balls that record the goings on of \\"important people,\\" but not his arch nemesis. When the final battle comes, Kevin seems a little too easily tricked. The conflict is inspired, especially because it takes place at a science fiction convention, but I saw the twist coming a mile away.<br /><br />All in all, Galatea in 2-D is less about Galatea and more about the artist.  For anyone who has ever been a freelancer, his frustration and aspirations make for entertaining (and sometimes painfully accurate) reading.  If only we could all blame a Kevin Matthews for whenever a contract goes bad.Kevin's paintings are something out of a Harryhausen flick (ancient Greek heroes, gargoyles, and stone Cyclopes).

US	53051790	R34QT5AAIIIIJ	006054094X	264716684	1421: The Year China Discovered America	Books	4	10	17	N	N	I'll choose the Chinese over aliens and Atlanteans any day	My comprehension of how Americas was \\"discovered\\" is a journey unto itself.<br /><br />No wait, that sounded cheesy.  Stick with me.  This story has relevance to the review. No, really.<br /><br />I first attended a seminar on Christopher Columbus back in my undergraduate days.  I learned a lot about just how ridiculous Columbus was, including his insanity, his lack of any true navigating skills, and the fact that he took several useless bushes back to Europe as \\"rare herbs.\\"  By far the biggest joke was that Columbus thought he had discovered China, despite all evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />Columbus was hardly the paragon of virtue that many Italians hoped to cast him as.  And I should know, I'm Italian.<br /><br />This sort of ethnocentrism can be insidious. There are lots of theories about extraterrestrials colonizing the earth, most of them centered on the anomalies and archaeological oddities that have been discovered throughout the centuries. The thinking goes something like this: any major achievement, like the pyramids, cannot possibly be the work of any non-white race.  Therefore...ALIENS MUST HAVE BUILT IT.<br /><br />The \\"alien colonization\\" theory is a new twist on the old belief of Theosophy, the Blavatsky-spawned theory that Atlanteans built everything.  In case you're wondering, Blavatsky helped create theosophy, a philosophy the Nazis used as their ideology for exterminating Jews.<br /><br />So what the heck does all this have to do with Menzies' 1421?<br /><br />In 1421, the Emperor Zhu Di was the most powerful ruler in the world.  With the near-infinite resources of China at his disposal, he performed bureaucratic acts of pharaoh-like proportions: he relocated the capital, diverted a river to serve said capital, and built a massive fleet of gigantic treasure ships for the sole purpose of bringing the world under China's tribute system.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the admirals and generals were sailing to all corners of the world, things at home took a turn for the worse. A storm set the new palace on fire, killing the Emperor's favored concubine.  The horrible human cost of the Emperor's extravagance eventually empowered the Mandarins to rebel against him.  Zhu Di's pioneering treasure fleet became a symbol of his decadence.  When the ships returned, they were disgraced and all record of their travels destroyed.  China withdrew from the world to take care of its own.<br /><br />Menzies' theory is that the fleets were much more successful than ever imagined.  He sets out in intricate detail how each of the treasure fleets colonized every continent, using evidence ranging from porcelain that only comes from China to DNA evidence of Chinese descendants, from oral history of aborigines referencing \\"people in white,\\" to structural anomalies built by a mysterious, ancient race on every continent.<br /><br />In other words, Menzies' references the same evidence supporting the alien and Atlantean theories, down to the Bimini road. Unfortunately, this also means that Menzies' evidence is extremely one-sided.  It's difficult to distinguish between what is given as concrete evidence (Chinese chickens on every continent) and what is not quite as concrete (the realignment of every forgotten map so that it fits Menzies' theories).<br /><br />Ironically, Menzies' hypothesis actually strengthens Columbus' insistence that he had found Asia.  Columbus was convinced he had found China because he carried maps that told said it was there.  Menzies' detractors do their own arguments a great disservice; suddenly, Columbus doesn't seem quite so insane after all.<br /><br />Do I believe him?  Menzies' research is compelling: he quotes several sources that clearly indicate the Portuguese and later Columbus had evidence of unexplored continents before they stepped foot on them.  But the connections are so varied and presented with such authenticity that it's extremely difficult to determine the veracity of all of his findings without being a scholar.<br /><br />Still, given the choice of theorizing just what caused the similarities across continents in culture and mythology, I'll choose the Chinese over aliens and Atlanteans any day.he veracity of all of his findings without being a scholar.   <br /> <br />Still, given the choice of theorizing just what caused the similarities across continents in culture and mythology, I'll choose the Chinese over aliens and Atlanteans any day.	2005-05-02

Heck, I'm green with envy over his success.  I'm not quite as envious over his scriptwriting career, but that's still more produced scripts than I have (0). There are exactly two stories I've read that I actually enjoyed: the short story \\"The Cat from Hell\\" and the novel \\"The Eyes of the Dragon.\\" A lot of people have read \\"The Eyes of the Dragon,\\" so I won't dwell on it other than to say that it's a fantasy novel and not a bad one at that.<br /><br />Virtually no one has heard of \\"The Cat from Hell,\\" which I stumbled across as a child looking for short stories about fantastic characters.  Boy did I get one, a terrifying tale of an assassin hired to execute a cute little kitty that turns out to be far more dangerous than anyone could ever imagine.  I don't think Mr. King doesn't like cats.<br /><br />Anyway, what I've since read from King since often seemed like it meandered.  Where \\"The Cat from Hell\\" was a tight, gripping story, there has since been a lot of farting, nose picking, and other silliness interspersed through King's novels that turn me off.  It's like a kid making farting sounds with his armpit during a scary movie...hard to be scared when someone's giggling behind you.<br /><br />On Writing explains King's approach and more.  It also sums up a lot of King's life, a life that would make exceptionally fertile material for his later horror movies.  Most significantly, the book is refreshingly honest.  King doesn't think his works are masterpieces, but he does believe he is an artist and a successful one.  He talks about it like it is, explaining what it takes to be a writer and more significantly, what will make you a GOOD writer.  King has little respect for writing classes. In fact, one could argue On Writing is the first and last book anyone needs about writing.<br /><br />For King, the most important aspect of writing is telling the truth: about oneself, about what you know, about whom you know, and how you know it.  His clear-minded approach cuts through the usual claptrap about high art, English teacher sophisms, and notions about what it means to be a \\"success.\\"  King really gives it his all, baring his heart and soul and admitting to some very nasty things in his life that nearly ended his career.<br /><br />Then King was hit by a van.<br /><br />That last chapter is riveting, not the least of which is because it is as if the book's wisdom is put to the test.  King, in detail that only he can describe, explains just what happened.  And it all seems a lot like his novels, a real life horror story.<br /><br />The highest compliment I can give this book is that it sent me straight back to my writing, the \\"closed door\\" kind, the kind written for the Ideal Reader, the kind that is what I know not what I think I should know.<br /><br />King inspires prospective authors to write the Truth.  And that's more valuable than all his other books put together.telling the truth: about oneself, about what you know, about whom you know, and how you know it.

Ressler reminds us	For those of you who are not big fans of serial killers and the people who catch them (or at least won't admit it publicly), Bob Ressler is the guy who invented the term \\"Serial Killer\\" and helped usher in a new understanding of repeat criminals and why they do what they do.  The citizens of the U.S. owe a lot to Bob.  So does Thomas Harris, who interviewed him extensively for Manhunter and Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />Alas, truth is stranger than fiction, and the tales Ressler tells are positively awful.  There' just one problem: we've heard all of this before.<br /><br />Where?  That'd be \\"Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit,\\" by John E. Douglas, a man I can only assume was Ressler's prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  It's a bit murky as to their relationship (the two reference each other, but not often).  The parallels are unmistakable-it's interesting to read the opinions of two different people interviewing the same serial killer.<br /><br />For example, Douglas has a bit of a creepy admiration for Ed Kemper.  Kemper had a diabolical mind that he put to good use, such that eventually he figured out why he was killing women: because he hated his mother.  So Kemper did what every good serial killer would do in such a situation...he killed her too.  His murders \\"finished,\\" Kemper called the police and gave himself up.<br /><br />That little story is from Douglas' point of view.  It almost makes Kemper out to be a sympathetic figure.  A six-foot tall, 300 pound sympathetic figure, but sympathetic nonetheless.<br /><br />Ressler is not so kind.  Ressler interviews Kemper alone at one point.  Having finished the interview, Ressler rings for the guard...but nobody comes.  Sensing his discomfort, Kemper explains how he could probably screw Ressler's head off with his bare hands and nobody would be able to do anything about it.

I'm writing a book about playing the \\"good guys\\" who hunt typical movie slashers, and this book seemed like a good introduction into how the ESCU works to catch the bad guys.  What I got was something else entirely.<br /><br />John Douglas is a very scary man.  He's someone who has seen far too many horrific crimes, such that they affect him personally-when his kids scrape their knees, Douglas recounts tales of children torn in half by a murderer.  When his wife cuts her finger with a kitchen knife, he points out how the spatter pattern would tell a story about what happened.  Ultimately, this sort of exposure leads to a divorce and Douglas is upfront about the damage his profession did to his job.<br /><br />The book starts out with Douglas in the hospital, the victim of being overworked and without enough manpower to help him.  Near death, he recounts the creation of the ESCU and his struggles in making the profiling of serial killers (he invented the term) a legitimate profession.  But it does not go into much detail as to how the ESCU works.  In fact, it's more about Douglas and about the murderers themselves.<br /><br />And what a ghastly rogues gallery it is!  We have serial killers who invent vigilante groups to cover their tracks, we have killers who like to fly prostitutes out to woodlands and then hunt them down like deer, killers who believe God is telling them to kill people, and killers who strangle, rape, drown, and stab.<br /><br />I read \\"Legacy of Blood: A Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies\\" at the same time and found an odd juxtaposition between the two books.  Legacy of Blood states that the comfort of slasher flicks is that the bad guy is easily recognized by his disgusting appearance and his sudden attacks, when in reality serial killers often look like normal people and torture their victims for hours.<br /><br />Not true, according to Mindhunter.  Indeed, many of the killers are degenerate slimeballs, incapable of social contact and forced to use blitz-style attacks against the weak and helpless because of their inadequacies.  Many have severe stutters, bad acne, or some other disfigurement.  Nearly all have been abused in some fashion by their parents.<br /><br />By now, the serial killer traits are well known: bed wetting, fire starting, and torturing small animals.  But Douglas makes it clear that in every case, it's the child's upbringing that so horribly warps them to a life of murder.  There are no strong role models to stop these children from turning into monsters; indeed, when children fall into the cracks, serial killers are what sometimes crawl out of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, exactly how Douglas comes to his conclusions is a lot like magic.  Despite all of his attempts to legitimize what he does, his efforts amount to \\"and then magic happens!\\" Then Douglas comes up with a startling accurate profile.  He never lets us know when he's wrong. That's a minor quibble with a book that I couldn't put down.<br /><br />Mindhunter is as much a cautionary tale as it is a woeful biography of Douglas' life.  Only one of the victims actually manages to turn the tables on their assailant.  And in just about every other case, the killers were on murder sprees that lasted years with dozens of victims.  As Douglas puts it, \\"sometimes the dragon wins.\\"<br /><br />As an author, this book gave me a host of ideas on how the good guys and the bad guys work. As a citizen of the United States, it gave me a new appreciation for the FBI.  As a husband, it gave me a healthy regard for the mentally disturbed.

If you haven't seen it, you should see Evil Dead II (funnier and not quite as disturbing). Then, if you're drunk, see Army of Darkness. Then come back to this review -- it won't make much sense otherwise.<br />In the bookstore, I picked up the Evil Dead Companion, flipped through it, and put it back down. It seemed mildly interesting, but it didn't have enough to hold my attention. I forgot about it.<br />Then for Christmas, lo and behold, Maleficent bought it for me. So I figured it'd be worth a good read, especially in fleshing out my D20 Modern supplement, Evil Dead: Swallow This! If you don't know what that is, 1) shame on you, 2) visit my web site for more details.<br />Bill Warren's a fan of Raimi and Bruce and co. A big fan. In fact, he's so much of a fan, there's a slant to the material that wasn't quite hard-hitting enough for my tastes. I submit this evidence at the end of the book:<br />These guys from Detroit are among the most decent, likeable people this writer has ever met, and it has been an enormous pleasure, one of the greatest of my professional life, to have been associated with them.<br />Okay, WHOA. I really like Bruce Campbell. When I finally do meet him, I'll proably make a stuttering idiot of myself. But come on now. Even if this is true, and I'm sure it is, would you be quite so effusive with the praise?<br />Also, a good chunk of the book -- pages 180 through 251 -- is a summary of the script with commentary from Bruce. Some if it's interesting. Some of it is irritating in its lack of specifics. It's not the REAL script, it's a summary.<br />But I'm griping about things that ultimately should be meaningless to a true-blue (true-red?) fan of Evil Dead. The book actually is more about the first movie, Evil Dead, than Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness because...well because that's what Sam and Bruce wanted to talk about most.<br />The stories are funny. Sam takes a wicked glee in abusing Bruce. And the early days of filming were hell -- literally and cinematically. The behind the scenes stuff is interesting.<br />The writer makes a half-hearted attempt to make the book an inspirational tale. The idea being that if Sam can do it, you can do it. But that isn't true at all. These friends were all connected to other people who were hell-bent on making movies too. In short, the average hopeful filmmaker is probably NOT working with a bunch of other guys who were ultimately making it on their own. In my experience, the average filmmaker is a kid in a basement trying to film stuff on his own. Sam and Bruce were talented guys with a level of desperation and daring most sane people aren't willing to go. And oh yeah, they don't appear to have had long-term relationships at the time either.<br />The book's becoming rapidly outdated. I checked all the web sites listed in the back and over 50% of them are gone. The game mentioned, Hail to the King, came and went.<br />In short, if you're an Evil Dead fan, you will enjoy this book. A lot of the quotes are taken from other sources vs. interviewing (I can write a book that way too, duh), but there's enough hidden gems that make it worthwhile. If you're not that big a fan, this book will probably bore you pretty quickly.using Bruce. And the early days of filming were hell -- literally and cinematically.

And that thing is part disease, part animal, part predator. It's a mimic that can replicate any form. And it has a desire to propagate. If it escapes from the facilities in the frozen wasteland, it will spread to humanity and ultimately take over every living thing in the world, all of them part of the original creature.<br />I had the privilege of reading the short story, the novelization, and watching the movie all within the span of a few days, so the differences and similarities were fresh in my mind. There are quite a few significant changes between the book and the movie, and the short story and the book.<br />Did I mention the men have cattle down in some weird storage facility? Cattle? I get the impression the original author never visited an Antarctic facility -- but hey, that's why it's called science fiction.<br />The short story is much more about the paranoia of men cooped up in close quarters, than about the alien itself. Everyone's too damn jovial -- they smirk and grin about everything even in the face of danger. It's all very pulpy too -- McReady is a &quot;bronze god.&quot; He's strong, he's smart, and gosh darn it, everybody likes him!<br />In the short story, combat is so brief that in one case, it took several readings to recognize the men had attacked another transformed Thing. They &quot;do their work&quot; -- that sums up over a dozen man hacking a Thing to bits.<br />On the other hand, a lot of questions that I've seen on web sites dedicated to The Thing are explained. Do you know if you're a Thing? Yes, according to the short story. In fact, The Thing is telepathic -- that's how it can gain instant knowledge of everything about a person and imitate them so well. It also explains how the Thing is always one step ahead of the men in the movie.<br />I like to think of the short story as a summary of what happened to the Norwegians.<br />The novelization, extrapolated from the original script of the film, is one of those rare books that's better than the movie. There are less characters than the short story, but they react much more realistically. They are all seriously flawed (far more than the morons from Who Goes There?). Most importantly, the presence of guns heighten the tension.<br />The novelization makes the movie make more sense. Most specifically, the dogs don't run away from the Thing -- they attack it. This changes everything. The dogs become infected and run off, only to be chased by McReady and Childs. It's a shame the scene wasn't included -- it gives a hint of just what the Thing can do. It also explains how the Thing can be so large (another FAQ about Things).<br />One character (was it Saunders?) uses his roller skates to race for his life against the Thing as it plows behind him, only to get trapped in the bathroom and ultimately kill himself with a sharpened piece of wood.<br />There's a lot more discussion, but I understand why much of it was cut down. There's also better emphasis in the movie than in the book -- HOW the actors say their lines changes everything.<br />The most important discovery is that the Thing takes ONE HOUR to change into something else. This simple number changes the entire tone of the book. With a hard and fast rule, the character's paranoia and reactions are tempered by the knowledge that they have time on their side. Very different from the movie.<br />If you're a fan of the movie, buy the book.n the movie. <br />I like to think of the short story as a summary of what happened to the Norwegians. <br />The novelization, extrapolated from the original script of the film, is one of those rare books that's better than the movie.

US	53051790	R1FZGUTGELNKCW	0393317552	733405472	Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Breathtaking in its breadth	I originally learned about Guns, Germs, and Steel on the RPG.net forums. It sounded like an excellent book to ground a Game Master or an author on world-building. So I put it on my wish list and last Christmas I received it as a gift. It took me this long to finish reading it, and I'm the better for it.<br />But I put it down after reading one chapter into it. The author, Jared Diamond, explains on page 19 that racist explanations are &quot;loathsome, but also...wrong. Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking.&quot; Then he turns around and states, &quot;...modern &quot;Stone Age&quot; peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples. Displaying his bias up front, Diamond states on page 21, &quot;in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westerners, and they surely are superior in escaping the devastating developmental disadvantages under which most children in industrialized societies now grow up.&quot;<br />There's a few problems with Diamond's arguments, not the least of which is that he spends two pages arguing a point that he has no means of scientifically proving. This is ironic, given his last chapter that talks about a scientific approach to history. It's also telling that Diamond has but one source mentioned in his notes for his argument that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners.<br />On its surface, I don't object to Diamond's bias. It does however, taint his entire argument. It's difficult to take Diamond seriously when he devotes an entire book proving that one society's domination of another is not inherently racist but determined by a wide variety of other factors - but oh yeah, New Guineans are genetically superior. It's like listening to a priest and a die-hard atheist argue - the two are so diametrically polarized, it's difficult to consider either argument as objective.<br />So I put the book down and it sat on my shelf for two months. Then I decided to give Diamond another chance, because some of what he said was intriguing. To whit, Diamond provides evidence that societies excel because of a combination of geographic and societal factors.<br />For example, farming societies can produce more food per square foot than hunting societies. Hunters have to expend energy to carry their children, so too many hinders the tribe. Farmers can stay put and reproduce as well as feed more mouths. As time goes on, farming societies can support politicians. Politicians are better at waging war and organizing peoples than hunters, who will often leave the area and move on to a less dangerous location.<br />Farmers also coexist with domesticated animals. Of particular relevant for world builders are the attributes that make an animal useful for domestication, including diet (food must be easily available), growth rate (they must grow quickly enough to be productive), breed in captivity, benign disposition, not prone to panic, and social structure (herd or pack mentalities allow humans to take roles in the domesticated animals' structure). Animals are important for another reason - by coexisting with them, humans are exposed to a wider variety of diseases earlier than hunters. This is how Europeans ended up plaguing North and South Americans.<br />Geographically, he east-west axis of a continent allows cultures to travel easier across similar terrain as opposed to a north-south continent, which will have a wider variety of climates. This in turn makes it easier to carry foodstuffs and farming.<br />On the opposite extreme, unified societies can be a hindrance. China fell behind modern societies even though it led the world in chemistry, clockworks, exploration, and warfare - all because the ruling classes passed laws to prohibit their development. Conversely, Europe's fragmentation was ripe enough in its diversity to allow good ideas to eventually flourish.<br />Diamond's overview is breathtaking in its breadth and a critical part of our education system. It should be in every child's school texts. It helps dispel, once and for all, the racist notions that pervade common views of history - if only Diamond could keep his own biases out of the book.urish. <br />Diamond's overview is breathtaking in its breadth and a critical part of our education system.

US	53051790	R23M9CMR75W6D8	B00008AJCF	244559708	Tuxedo Park	Books	4	16	18	N	N	Tuxedo Park is an impressive achievement	Tuxedo Park is a factual history lesson, in a vein similar to The Devil in the White City, only without the serial killer.<br />Tuxedo Park takes place a bit later, pre-World War II. It starts with the death of one of the scientists who used to visit Tuxedo Park, a veritable fortress of technology and leisure. The suicidal scientist posthumously published a fictionalized book about the goings on there and sold it as science fiction. It was so bizarre that of course, nobody suspected, although the primary subject of the novel, Alfred Loomis, knew better.<br />Alfred Loomis is the star of the story, a rich entrepreneur with an all-consuming, frightening intellect. He applies his own cold, nearly inhuman methodology to business and science and excels at both. Loomis is also charismatic and connects with people in a way that makes him irresistible. A veritable human whirlwind, he swept people up and sometimes left them broken and lost behind him, most notably his wife whom he tried to have committed and left for a younger woman.<br />Loomis invented electrocardiograms (those brainwave doohickeys that draw jagged lines as a patient sleeps) and radar and made fantastic leaps in refining the science of sonics and magnetics. If the book has a moral, it's that money brings freedom, and Loomis was the freest man on Earth. He developed what he wanted, hosted who he wanted, encouraged projects he felt had vision, and had enough influence to determine the course of events in World War II.<br />What's so striking is that the world needed Loomis. The author, Jennet Connant, makes striking connections that identify just how significant Loomis' contributions (and machinations) were in ensuring victory over the Axis powers. From the atom bomb to the British radar systems, Loomis' fingerprints are on them all. And it was through sheer force of will, coupled with his massive wealth that made things happen.<br />The book suffers from the same problems as Devil in the White City - some parts are more boring than others. It's entertaining to read about Loomis' inventions, but I had difficulty distinguishing between the various scientists. There are so many intellects that are hosted by Loomis that they start to run together; on the other hand, the book features a lot of familiar faces like Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, and others. Still, the physics and complexities of the inventions, along with the internecine squabbling drag in some places.<br />Perhaps the most exciting part of the book is when one British physicist embarks on a journey to bring all the technological advances of Britain to America with just himself and a trunk full of highly classified documents and devices. The thought of what could happen to that trunk (and how it nearly gets lost a few times) is nerve wracking and the makings of an excellent short story or role-playing adventure. It's the kind of scenario that is usually considered to be bad form by a writer - but it really happened.<br />Fortunately for us, the trunk made its way safely to America. The book really picks up as the devices Loomis raced to invent are finally implemented in the war. And then, when the action finally gets going, the book is over. There is definitely a feeling of the passing of something great that people could only look at indirectly and never touch - just like the intentional destruction of the Chicago World's Fair, Loomis Tuxedo Park is abandoned, his &quot;rad lab&quot; of scientists disbanded, only to backstab each other during McCarthy's &quot;Un-American&quot; committees. Worse, Loomis' divorce left his family sharply divided - like all things, Loomis treated his relationships with an intellectual clarity that was less a romance and more calculated odds. When Loomis felt his wife was not measuring up, she was discarded along with his other failed experiments. It dims, but cannot diminish completely, Loomis' personality.<br />Tuxedo Park is an impressive achievement. It manages to record theorigin of the American scientist, the belief that technology is inherently good, and sharply frames the slow, lumbering bureaucracies that run everything from medical achievements to military advancements. In comparison, Loomis and his teams are breathtakingly nimble at a time when the world needed speed and decisive action most. It is an important part of history and a sharp reminder that rich men, should they choose, could do great good or terrible harm. Loomis was that rare combination of brilliance and wealth that creates freedom - an aberration not likely to be seen again in my lifetime.cord the origin of the American scientist, the belief that technology is inherently good, and sharply frames the slow, lumbering bureaucracies that run everything from medical achievements to military advancements.

Bruce is known as THE MAN by fans. Watch Evil Dead 2 and you'll understand.<br />This is not to say that everything Bruce produces is gold. Indeed, he's slogged through a lot of crap to get where he is. Unfortunately, where Bruce is at this time does not involved huge piles of money, and if the returns on Bubba Ho-Tep are any indication, it's not going to happen any time soon.<br />But as Bruce would say - so what? If Chins Could Kill gives us an insight into Bruce's philosophy on life and his long, hard struggle from Michigan to Hollywood and back again. I was able to identify with much of Bruce's childhood because my wife grew up in the same area and I lived there for three years. Heck, I went to Michigan State University too (where Sam and Bruce first aired &quot;The Happy Valley Kid&quot;).<br />That said, this book is a breezy read, chopped into chapters only as long as they need to be. Bruce talks about his life in such a way that you suspect he's not telling you everything - certainly, most of the personal stuff is left out except for the divorce from his wife. Even that is vague. Bruce wants us to think he's a well-meaning doofus, but he seems too shrewd and committed to his craft to have just stumbled into his career.<br />Fans who are familiar with the Evil Dead commentaries will find some of the recollections repetitive. Yeah, we all know about the locals who stole the power saw but not the thousand-dollar camera, or the Ram-O-Cam, or the reaction fans had to Evil Dead. On the other hand, there are little gems hidden here and there, most specifically when Bruce encounters a fox (the animal) and plays with it in the afternoon sun for a few hours. That chapter seems to sum up Bruce: a good-natured fellow who is nevertheless capable of taking advantage of the right situations at the right time.<br />Bruce's voice comes through in the narration, sometimes so informally that it's difficult to follow. He will often reference an acquaintance without any backstory and then talk about someone else in the next sentence. There's also a lot of pictures with supposedly funny captions - they're not that funny and since they're all in black-and-white, they're all very fuzzy. On the other hand, the (we can only presume) actual emails of various fans that start of each chapter are hysterical.<br />When Bruce isn't talking about his life (and some of the book does talk about his life, despite Bruce's disclaimer), he talks about the movie industry in a way that's valuable and informative. Here, we learn about movie etiquette, about movie stars who suck (hint: Tom Arnold) and just how capricious the casting process is.<br />Finally, the book has an addendum covering Bruce's &quot;Chins Across America&quot; tour. As a regular convention attendee myself, this part of the book was by far the most entertaining. It's also the least edited. Still, the fans are at least as entertaining as Bruce himself, and given that Bruce has worked in a variety of genres (fantasy, horror, westerns) his fan base is quite diverse.<br />Ultimately, Bruce's book is like his movies - it's a little rough around the edges but charming because of it.dvantage of the right situations at the right time. <br />Bruce's voice comes through in the narration, sometimes so informally that it's difficult to follow.

As a regular convention attendee myself, this part of the book was by far the most entertaining. It's also the least edited. Still, the fans are at least as entertaining as Bruce himself, and given that Bruce has worked in a variety of genres (fantasy, horror, westerns) his fan base is quite diverse. <br />Ultimately, Bruce's book is like his movies - it's a little rough around the edges but charming because of it.	2004-03-22

Written by veterans who know their stuff, it's obvious that there's a strong historical context winding its way through the information provided throughout. And of course, that information is about everybody's favorite NPC class, the warrior.<br /><br />Okay, so warriors aren't everybody's favorite NPC class. In fact, they're usually glossed over as [bad] fighters. Their role has never clearly been defined -- the DMG's explanation of the warrior class leaves them open to interpretation. Warriors aims to change that.<br />The artwork in the book varies greatly, from obvious black and white clipart to extremely cartoony (the executioner on p. 21 being the most egregious example).<br />The book begins with an Introduction to warriors in general and a reference to a new innovation, the subtype. The subtype idea is a means of defining an NPC without making them overly powerful. They are not like the old 2nd Edition kits (thank goodness!) but they do help delineate the skills and feats of say, a longbowman vs. a shortbowman. Warriors also claims to have reprinted previously published material from the Experts book. However, there are numerous (and after the first few times, annoying) references to go read the Experts book for more information. Warriors also mentions that it's meant to be 3.5 compatible, but that the conversion might not be perfect (it isn't). It rounds out the introduction with a description of medieval armies that helps set the sometimes gritty tone of the book. Unlike the Experts book, Warriors is largely open game content.<br />The prestige classes chapter details a wide variety, including Aerial Cavalryman, Beast Rider, Charioteer, Combat Engineer, Dueling Master, Executioner, Forester, Gladiator, Marine, Mechanist Infantry, Militia Leader, Mountaineer, Nomadic Cavalryman, Sheriff, Watchman, and Zealot. Warriors is strongest when it hews closely to the historical archetypes of warriors and is weaker when it ranges into the fantasy genre. Each prestige class is accompanied by an example of the class, helpful to DMs and players alike who know what prestige class they want but wouldn't recognize it by name.<br />The next chapter details warrior subtypes. Subtypes are sort of a poor man's occupations from d20 Modern. In fact, they are quite similar, if a bit more detailed, than occupations. I like the idea -- it helps round out the warrior class and provide alternatives without requiring the levels of a prestige class. Thus, there are longbow subtypes, artillerist subtypes, etc. Each subtype gets a special benefit, usually a class skill -- just like d20 Modern occupations. Unlike the occupations, each subtype comes with suggested equipment and feats it can substitute. The subtypes also include non-military versions, like the bandit and barkeep. Incidentally, this book's subtypes is an excellent complement to Mercenaries: Born of Blood.<br />The skill chapter goes into exquisite detail about everything from Craft (artifice) to the rune-carving Craft (Koftgari). Warriors keeps the new skills to a minimum, offering Operate Device, Signaling, Smell, Taste, and Torture. Duh -- why didn't anyone else think of the Smell and Taste skills when we have Listen and Spot? One of the best chapters in the book.<br />The feats chapter details relatively bland feats, including a bunch of aerial combat feats and some feats specific to prestige classes/subtypes.<br />The equipment chapter is a study in contrasts: fantasy equipment is mixed in with exotic weapons and armor from other cultures. Thus we have the chakram, khandar, and pata mixed in with the assault mechanist armor (in essence, power armor). This is one of those situations where the book overextends itself a bit -- armor of this type is best left to books like D20 Mecha (where is D20 Mecha, anyway?). It also includes rules on making high technology weapons and transportation, including balloons and dirigibles. It even explains how gunpowder is made.<br />The spells chapter is primarily dominated by battle runes, which are used by zealots. These battle runes are not remarkable -- they're just a variant of material components. Some of the spells have a middle-Eastern feel to them (like eye of Shiva and searing sands). The spell, transformation of Jebus, seems like a juiced up version of Tenser's transformation.<br />The magic items chapter ranges all over the place, from (armor, claw, boots, cloak, etc.) of the beast to more exotic items like the bow of Rama, dwarven firewagon, table of Ezekiel and thunderbolt of Hirtadhvaj. Someone did their homework.<br />The monsters appendix is unexceptional. It has three monsters in total, the primary focus being the Narasinhai. They're a anthropomorphic lion race. We've seen it before.<br />The third appendix details sample characters, useful for dropping NPCs that use the Warriors rules right into the game. A sorely needed attribute that takes a LOT of work to create -- I speak from personal experience.<br />The last three appendices are excellent. They detail chariot warfare, elephant warfare and heraldry. Each appendix is short but descriptive and summarizes all the information you need to know in a succinct fashion.<br />While the text and artwork may be at times uneven, Warriors achieves its goal -- it fleshes out the warrior NPC class with enough ideas that it can easily be applied to PCs. It works best when applied as a straight historical interpretation of the D20 system and is less effective when it veers off into fantasy elements that are obviously favorites of the authors.

US	53051790	R3PETS6180ZGIE	1574570110	741782660	Rifts World Book 18: Mystic Russia	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A servicable resource for most role-playing games	Now that fantasy RPGs are looking for new cultures to exploit, Russia has finally come into its own. Mystic Russia is, as the back of the cover states, about \\"...Russian Myth, but given that ol' Rifts® twist.\\" It does a servicable job of bringing Russian monsters to life, and to a lesser degree, the O.C.C.s of Russian folklore.<br />The monster section is the best part and obviously the primary reason for the book, as they're placed in the front (which seems peculiar to me). Most are pulled right from Russian folklore, but a few seem like someone thought the picture looked cool and threw in some statistics for it, like the Demon Claw. Of particular note are the Koshchei (remember that guy from the AD&D Monster Manual II?) and the Kaluga Hag on page 27, my vote for what the Blair Witch looks like. The artwork throughout the book is above par.<br />Speaking of witches, as usual, this book heavily emphasizes that magic isn't real and neither are witches. Unless you are a practicing witch, in which case, please don't be offended. Mr. Siembedia points this out on page 1. And page 10. And page 72. And 73.<br />Perhaps the biggest flaw of all the books Mr. Siembedia writes are the finger-wagging, condescending quips that are littered throughout the rules. For example, on the topic of the evil Necromancer as an O.C.C., he advises to \\"...please respect the G.M.'s decision and move forward with the game.\\" Move forward with the game? We were in the middle of an argument and the author's narrative made us stop, turn to that passage, and suddenly realize we should all just \\"move forward with the game\\" and stop arguing about the rules? This kind of condescending blather is presumably due to the younger target audience, but I'm sure they find it insulting too.<br />The Pact Witch, Hidden Witch and Old Believer O.C.C.s are interesting looks at Russian folklore and magic, although occasionally the spells are so specific as to be of questionable value (spoil water, curdle mlik, spoil wine, and spoil eggs could probably be grouped under spoil food). The Necromancer and Fire Sorcerer are reprinted from other Rifts books. It's disconcerting to see (NEW!) in front of the Bone Magic section. So the rest of the spells aren't new? Of all the O.C.C.s, the Mystic Kunzya stands out as truly unique, super-smiths with a penchant for super weapons. Super-powerful unbalancing weapons, but hey, you don't play Rifts for game balance anyway.<br />The Gypsy section is suspiciously generic. While the first crop of O.C.C.s delve into very specific spells of limited usefulness, the Gypsy section is devoid of detail. Professions like the Chovihani are missing completely, unless you use the Hidden Witch, which is not what Chovihani were about. This would be a perfect place for such spells as steal liver and a variety of thief protection spells that Chovihani were known for.<br />The last section seems like an afterthought about Sovietski tanks and war machines. This is Mystic Russia, right?<br />All in all, this book is a servicable resource for most role-playing games. However, as a Rifts supplement, it's fluffed out with a lot of material in other books under the guise of being reprinted for the \\"player's convenience.\\"l wine, and spoil eggs could probably be grouped under spoil food).

The Wizard's Spell Compendium, now complete, was a valuable addition to any player or Dungeon Master's repertoire of spells. On the other hand, it was just gravy, and it suffered (like other collections) from typos, poor editing, and the general impression that someone cut and pasted the information together haphazardly.<br />In the case of specialty Priests, the division of spells that occurred as a result of the Second Edition rules caused some serious unbalances in the game. Some specialty Priests have spheres with few spells in them, like the Astral sphere. Because many spells can be \\"reversed,\\" evil Priests have access to the Healing sphere and good Priests have access to the Necromantic sphere.<br />Then there's \\"powers\\" which are unique abilities bestowed upon Priests by their gods. The distinction between spells and powers is murky, as powers are not subject to the sphere categorizations. It was a convenient loophole for giving Priests spells that didn't fit with their deities profile.<br />With this confusing situation making a specialty Priest's life difficult, and the powers and spells largely up to the Dungeon Master's discretion, a sourcebook with more Priest spells is a welcome addition.<br />Content<br />Having a compilation of spells is useful for Druids and other specialty Priests who suffered from the sparse spheres they had to choose from. The PSC claims on page 3:<br />\\"Some description have been updated or combined with similar effects to eliminate duplication; some have been modified for better play, and a very few have been dropped entirely.\\" It's a no-brainer: take all the out-of-print supplements, put them into a database, and hit the print button. Then, just edit the combined content. How hard could that be?<br />Very hard, unfortunately. The PSC, while better edited than its predecessors (and that's not saying much), is still plagued by what seems an unwillingness on the part of the editors to comb through the book line by line. Nowhere is this more obvious than on page 9:<br />\\"In the sword-and-sandal Dark Sun setting, priests are preservers or defilers, depending on whether or not their magic drains the living energy of that world.\\" Priests are not preservers or defilers. That's a title applied to wizards in the Dark Sun setting. However, the above sentence is in the Wizard's Spell Compendium . Somebody replaced the word \\"Wizard\\" with \\"Priest\\" and pasted the introduction into the book. This did not bode well for the rest of the volume.<br />Organization<br />Some of the problems with PSC deal with the manner in which old spells were categorized into the new spheres created for Priests in the Second Edition rules. For example, why is age plant (p. 9) in the Time sphere, but not the Plant sphere? Several other spells are included in multiple spheres. The A section was a bit of a let down: the disturbingly slim Astral sphere only has a handful of spells in it, even with all the spells from other sources.<br />Icons accompany each spell to indicate, at a glance, what setting the spell fits best. This system is used inconsistently. Bad medicine (p. 52), a Shaman spell, is missing the savage setting icon.<br />There are several spells that create or summon monsters. The monster statistics are usually reproduced in the volume -- a necessity if the spells are to be of any use. Only some of the monsters' statistics appear, however: Create crypt thing (p. 154) has the created monster's statistics, but create death tyrant (p. 155) does not. If these statistics were removed intentionally to save space, it doesn't explain the large patches of blank space on pages 51 and 175.<br />Anyone remember the Dragon magazine article with six other Paladin classes, each based on a unique alignment? The Paramander's spells ended upin the Wizard's Spell Compendium, but the priest spells for the other Paladin classes are strangely excluded from this volume.<br />And then there's the inclusion of the coalstone's statistics without the actual spell to create it (p. 126). Why bother?<br />Artwork<br />The artwork consists of serviceable black and white pictures, mostly portraits. One evident change of WOTC's takeover of TSR is their unwillingness to recycle old artwork. This may seem like a minor quibble, but it's a sore point with a lot of TSR products. Yes, I can recognize reused artwork from the Pick A Path/Which Way Adventure books! Thankfully, the artwork always applies to a spell on the same page.<br />Conclusion<br />With the Third Edition of Dungeons and Dragons on its way, it's possible that editing this volume wasn't the top priority. Indeed, it may be that instead of providing a quality product, TSR's goal is to recycle all out-of-print material and then release them in electronic format at a much lower price.<br />The Priest's Spell Compendium selling point is obvious: you can't get many of these spells anywhere else. For players of specialty priests, it's a valuable addition to their library. Unfortunately, TSR just doesn't put enough effort into editing and organizing the spells to justify its high price tag for anyone else.the Wizard's Spell Compendium, but the priest spells for the other Paladin classes are strangely excluded from this volume.<br />And then there's the inclusion of the coalstone's statistics without the actual spell to create it (p. 126).

The book hits on so many topics, it's impossible to list them all: food, clothing, medicine, economy, measures, titles, saint, weapons...the list goes on and on. All are referenced in an easy to read, no commentary style that provides keywords in bold text with their definitions in each section. Even better, there's a Further Reading section at the end of each chapter.<br />As a springboard for further research, What Life Was Like is a prime resource. Of most immediate ues to gamers with a historical bent are the date of clothing styles (to avoid anachronistic styles of dress) and a description of the day to day activites of a castle. While it's probably a bit extreme to apply all of these principles to role-playing fantasy, which is, after all, FANTASY, this book goes a long way in providing a sense of feel to an environment that's so different from the modern world, it seems fantastic.<br />Thus this scene: &quot;The warrior takes a slurp from his soup bowl, then sticks another forkful of meat in his mouth as he mumbles, 'Yeah, I know him. What's it to ya?'&quot;<br />Becomes this: &quot;The warrior takes a slurp from his trencher, then sticks his knife into a hunk of meat and stuffs it in his mouth. He mumbles, 'Yeah, I know him. What's it to ya?'&quot;<br />No forks til the late fourteenth century! Forget wooden bowls, people used hollowed out bread as bowls.<br />Also prevalent throughout this Writer's Guide are the pictures and lists. Although my own personal preference is for line drawings in a work such as this, the pictures (of period actors) do the job. Also, the lists, when they appear, are relevant and to the point, including a list of popes and kings.<br />There are other books in the series that would probably find an application in role-playing: Guides to Victorian England, Renaissance England, and even the Wild West.

One race is highly psionic, the other is terribly close-minded. One is golden-skinned, the other pale. One is a free-thinking society, the other rules by a strict and secretive nobility. The female protagonist, having witnessed her parents' horrible death at a tender age, is unleashed as a psionic secret-agent against the other side, where she wanders throughout the universe looking for a mate who can survive her mental and physical powers. The meeting between the two is a bit confusing (I read it twice and even now try to guess what REALLY happened), but rewarding. A novel that starts with a whimper and ends with a bang.	1996-12-17

Ender's Game is the first (and best) in a series about Ender, a young boy bred to be a leader in a society where more than two children is illegal. An alien race, insect-like possessing a hive mind (sound familiar? see The Madness Season), has attacked Earth, and we live in fear that they may strike again, even though it was decades ago. Ender, a child of the state, is drafted into this war, and he is forced to survive a bitter and difficult life in military school. His sister and brother (his brother Peter seems to be based on a popular killer, who dissected roadkill in his backyard), take over the Earth while he's away at war - an idea that's doesn't sound so silly when you read how they manipulate the internet society. True genius at work, Ender's greatest triumph and worst tragedy make for a powerful ending. Once you're done reading it, put it down and read something else unrelated - the rest of the series doesn't carry as much of a punch.	1996-12-17

There are a lot of \\"The Web's so cool and if you just buy our book you can make a million dollars\\" kinds of books out there. I've gotten tired of them very quickly. For one, the Web is just new, it's not the salvation of mankind. For another, they always have some underlying motive (beyond making money), and usually its ramming their own web pages down your throat. Taylor doesn't do this. In fact, he makes you feel very welcome as he explains, in a pleasant narrative style, this big blob of networks called the Web. He's not condescending about it, he's not pushy about it, but he is excited about it, and it appears genuine. The book itself details the standard beginner stuff, with some advanced carrots that leave you drooling for more (I know how to do tables but how do I set up a counter?). Many of these books will disappear rapidly over time because of the advent of HTML editors like Netscape Gold, but this book will stick around - there's plenty in there for the advanced user too.

I was definitely a dog person, and I (like all former dog owners) think my dog Jingles was the best dog in the whole wide world. Now we have a cat named Maya. All the myths I ever had about cats were turned on on their ear. In a similar fashion, The Tribe of Tiger gives a powerful insight into these animals without being overly sweet. Very often books of this type become unreadable to non-cat owners who get sick from the sugary references to cats at their cutest. Instead, Thomas examines all manner of cats, from the plight of the African lions to the triumph of the house cat. I wasn't aware that cats had a social organization at all, but unlike dogs (who have a distinct order in the pack), cats treat one cat as leader, with the others all equal in a kind of spoked-wheel formation. When you find out just how important it is that a cat meet another cat's gaze (and the trials of a blind cat who was unable to do so), you will have a new respect for cats, and this book.	1996-12-17

Too many New Age references casually mention Templars as having secret knowledge, and too many fundamentalists point to the Templars (and Masons, who have their roots in the Knights Templar) as signs of occult influence. The answer would not please either side: The Knights Templar were an ostracized group of warriors who were treated in a similar fashion to Vietnam veterans - losing a war is bad for business, and in the Templars' case, fatal.	1996-12-17

Most people would pass this book up if they saw the above title (I would, if I saw it on a shelf). But then, a lot of people who bother to examine the plot of those Grade B Science Fiction movies would come to the same conclusion: those hackneyed plots are gems in capable hands. And Friedman certainly is capable! The Tyr, an alien hive-mind race, has already dominated humanity and much of the universe. Unexpectedly, they come upon a vampire who doesn't succumb to their normal soul-breaking tactics. This vampire (who, it should be noted, is never referred to as a vampire throughout the book) is humanity's salvation - he and another alien being known as a Mara fight a battle of intrigue against their captors. The Tyr undergo a dangerous and unpredictable transformation to improve their breeding chances with their queen, and the protagonist must unlock the secrets of their race if he is to survive. The ending will surprise you (and gross you out), but it's well worth the read. A rare find in science fiction and vampire novels alike.	1996-12-17

This is one of those books that seems like it's a byproduct of the true publication date (it's old enough that people use slide-rules, not calculators). Many of the science fiction works of yesteryear are outdated leftovers, left behind because technology has far surpassed the writer's wildest dreams. Not so for Heinlein, whose vision is powerful enough to make this book still enjoyable (despite the ever present slide-rules). It's one of those \\"perfect timing situations\\" in which the main character wins a spacesuit as a second place prize, refills its airtanks, and then when he realizes he has no use for a spacesuit at all, is kidnapped by aliens -- of course! Although it may seem like  light-hearted pulp fare, it has an underlying seriousness that makes the novel exceptional. It may also be a sad testament to our own space programs that Heinlein's work, after all these years, is not yet outdated.	1996-12-17

This book is a must have for any serious Star Trek fan. It details the time-line of the often confusing Star Trek universe in careful academic detail, yet the narrative is entertaining enough to make it readable from cover to cover. The pictures are rife throughout the book and intelligently placed (a big gripe of mine is when people show you pictures of things you don't care to see, or put pictures far away from the text referring to them), and there are plenty of discussions about character designs, star ships, and other subtle nuances and contradictions that a book of this depth inevitably stumbles across. Buy it...it will make the Star Trek universe a bit more comprehensible...and a lot more enjoyable.	1996-12-17

There are a lot of vampire books out there. Most of them have little to contribute to the vampire field, and a lot of them are formulaic exercises in putting vampires in situations you never see them in (vampire rock singers, vampire cops, etc.). Hambly uses a late gothic England to portray a vampire culture, not unfamiliar, but certainly refreshing. The vampires are being hunted by one of their own, and so they enlist the services of a British spy, the best (pitiful by vampire standards) humanity has to offer. When the protagonist seems reluctant, the vampires make the mistake of dragging his wife, a mortologist, into things. Part gothic horror, part science fact, Hambly treats vampires with respect without making us one of them. We are reminded how powerful, how  beautiful, and how dangerous these beings can be. All that and a suprise ending too!	1996-12-17

I stumbled upon this book in the library, immediately found myself coveting it, and then desperately considered photocopying the entire thing front to back. Fortunately, I didn't have to resort to such extreme measures - as a softcover the book is surprisingly affordable. There are few books of this type that are thorough and so lavishly illustrated; those that are have an equally lavish price tag. This book is a gem for those interested in weapons and armor of ancient and medieval times. There are indexes by geographical location as well as time period - an invaluable source for anyone interested in ancient weapons!	1996-12-17

Make no mistake, Liege-Killer is a very strange novel. The name gives little indication to just how bizarre it is, but it's an excellent insight into a new alien race (which consists of two beings who are similar to siamese twins, but can merge at any time) that has a few surprises of its own. Enter our hero, a cryogenically frozen man out for vengeance (the Paratwa killed his wife), and a dwarf. Their specialty: to kill the unkillable Paratwa. This book has a pounding rhthym that matches its hero's mantra: I move, I am, I want, I take, I see, I learn, I grow, I make. The story ultimately ends in a bitter victory that makes you thirst for more.	1996-12-17

This book is one of a little known work of Foster's that gets lost in the shuffle because he's written so much and so much better. But this speaks highly for his writing talent - this book is damned good, and few people know about it. The Ultimate Infatuation: You see a woman in a car as you're walking down the street, and you drop everything, literally, to meet her. Nothing can stop you. Your life is meaningless if you cannot be with her. This is how the novel starts, and set in an era when alien contact is a reality (and the aliens can teleport at will), how in a little genetic cloning, interplanetary gates, and an invasion, and you have a novel that makes ID4 look tame - you could punch the aliens  in ID4, these guys just teleport away. It's an excellent novel, and the hero has some very real moments (he is so upset at one point that he shuts a communication off momentarily so he can weep) that makes this novel shine.	1996-12-17
