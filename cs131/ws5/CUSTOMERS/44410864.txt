Sunday School, according to Towns, is not a dinosaur to be excavated and put on display, but a powerful tool of the modern era. <br /> <br />Sunday School can be crafted to build new converts, provide fellowship, train for ministry, and it has many other values as well.   <br /> <br />This book isn't necessarily a step by step blueprint for \\"building\\" a SS program in your church.  It will ,however, encourage you and your SS team to see the old SS hour as a great tool to carry out the Great Comission!	2005-04-20

This is a simple yet insightful book full of workable money management plans.   <br /> <br />We read this book over the course of a few hours one week and were immediately impressed with it.  Within only a few chapters, we were impressed with a desire to again be debt free.  Why?  When we're free of financial debt, we are more able to respond to the direction of God. <br /> <br />The book is not full of legalistic finger pointing,instead you'll find a careful and thoughtful approach to becoming debt free.  Christians and non-christians alike will find this a great resource to becoming open, humble, obedient, and less indebted.	2005-03-28

In other words, Mr. Jones doesn't mince words when it comes to his advice.  As the title suggest, he believes \\"If you do this\\", you'll enhance your leadership and become a successful youth pastor. <br /> <br />He'll show you how to lead through multiple lists.  Plug in components or entire pieces and your likely to build up your group of students and leaders.  Important topics he covers include; vision casting, mentoring, attitudes, and the reasons people may choose not to work with you. <br /> <br />The author's motive seems to come clear in this statement, \\"There has never been a greater day for youth ministry than now.  We have an opportunity to impact students and enjoy a God given legacy\\". <br /> <br />You risk being challenged, but aren't your students worth the risk?	2005-01-11

What has worship become?  To many, WORSHIP is the time before the sermon in most churches.  Worship might be a certain kind of music that gives you goose bumps and makes you feel \\"good\\".  In any case the use of this word is nearly synonymous with music or singing praise to God. <br /> <br />The singing that takes place in corporate worship is quite valuable, but it pales in the light of the true worshiper.  This true worshiper is one that gives every effort and every part of his life as a sacrifice. Each thing is done as unto Jesus himself. <br /> <br />Matt Redman does what I find near the top in valuing an author or speaker.  He reveals his heart. He is transparent.  He writes about times of confusion and talks about mistakes.  He has made himself humble after climbing to the top. <br /> <br />The Unquenchable Worshipper: Coming Back to the Heart of Worship is valuable and applicable to your life.  Although portions are directed to \\"lead worshipers\\", the advice is not intended to address the \\"up front crowd\\" alone but every believer in Jesus Christ. <br /> <br />This little book will enhance your life and could be shared with friends and family to help us all see that worship is \\"more than a song\\".	2004-12-16

It was loaned to me by a friend and I was immediately taken by its straight forward attack of an insidious enemy.   <br /> <br />Sorge's precepts are supported by biblical reference, the use of which is plentiful.  I see something in Sorge's writing that I like very much.  When scripture is brought into the chapter, he often brings clarity to its relevance through explanation and description, i.e., I am not expected to be a theologian to understand how the author wants to apply the information.  There are several illustrations from his own life and he is transparent enough to allow for believability. <br /> <br />It seems to me that the book has broad application in humanity as each of us deals with envy.  It deals with the Church in this, there are numerous references to the envy taking place between churchmen in each city or region.  Whereas many areas are seeing \\"community building\\" taking place in their town others are still working to outdo their fellow pastor.  Great strength comes to the church through unity of purpose under Christ! <br /> <br />Sorge makes a beautiful summary of what we'd be like minus envy when he says, \\"When we are rooted, grounded and perfected in love, our sense of identity in God is so profoundly fulfilled that nothing we see with the natural eye can produce an envious response within us.  We wish for nothing that anyone else has because we already have everything there is to have- an extravagant, intimate relationship with the Lord of the universe\\" (pg 132,133). <br /> <br />Enjoy this book and get a copy for your pastor. <br />	2004-12-10

This is a fine afternoon book, short and easy to read.  The twists and turns kept it moving.  I had forgotten how much fun the Iron Marshal is.  <br />The Iron Marshal once again proves Louis L'Amour's incredible range and command of historical fiction.  Others may tell the tale of the west, but this novel takes us deeper into the understanding of the life of an immigrant newcomer and how he becomes a part of the western expansion.<br />Tom Shanaghy is just a boy when the story begins.  He's alone and in a strange New York City.  Without father or mother this young boy is forced to make it alone.  The street becomes his teacher and like so many other young Irishman, he becomes embroiled in political disputes and controversies that force manhood upon him.<br />Tom seems to be alive only for the moment and this is noticed by the one man he truly trusts.  McCarthy, his mentor and teacher, suggests that Tom break away from the road he is traveling.  It leads to only one place and that place is somewhere without the support of the powerful people that rely upon his keen mind and strong arm.  One day he'll mean nothing to them and he'll find himself alone.<br />Through events outside of his control, Tom finds himself heading West.  From here the story takes on an interesting quality.  It's out of control.  Many of L'Amour's books follow the tale, but the Iron Marshal is hijacked by the greed of multiple individuals and he again finds himself thrust into a position he had no wanting for.<br />As an immigrant and eastern city man, this young Marshal is without the keen sense of tracking, rope craft, and small town living.  He must rely on near total strangers to unravel the mysteries surrounding him.  He also finds himself doubting all of the central characters.  Who's a part of scandal and who is not.?  How can he protect those that are potentially trying to kill him and this two-bit Kansas town?<br />Without explanation, the rug is pulled from beneath him and even the fewassets he had to work with appear to have been destroyed.  Tom, the Marshal, the chief suspect?  What was happening?  He was the only genuine chance this town had.  They were going to move in now.  All of it had come to a head right now, and in this moment it was all so clear.	2003-12-13

I've taken occasion to really look it over and I am impressed.  <br />The pages of this Bible are filled with one line study portions. There are several recurring themes for added reading that allow a young guy to explore the meanings of the Holy writ. They're short enough to pay attention to and rich enough to add something meaningful to the text.<br />There are dozens and dozens of colorful pages with tips and ideas for living the Christian Life.  How about ideas for a date or team projects, there here with enough flair to grab a boy's attention and help him complete \\"steps\\" of life that will honor God.<br />I really pay attention to bindings and overall book construction, and Revolution: The Bible for Teen Guys is well put together.  This Bible even feels like a guy's Bible.  It is stout and has nice proportions.  The hardback version has a cool cover design and is dark with just a tiny bit of color.  The Leather addition has a rich leather or leather like appearance and feel.  Supple would be a great word to describe the black leather cover.  <br />If your looking for a Bible that a teen guy can feel pretty good about carrying around in front of his friends, this one will work.  If you're looking for a guide to help spur a young man on to greater maturity in Christ, this is still your book. I would feel very comfortable giving this Bible to guys 12-16, and wouldn't be a bit surprised if the older guys liked it too ( I know I do).  This is just one high quality offering in the New International Version.	2003-12-04

The accounts of the martyrs on the beach are inspiring to say the least. They will challenge the most stalwart believer to ask, &#34; Am I willing to give everything?&#34;  Often we label books like these as being too graphic and descriptive for children, but I would like to suggest that allowing our young people to read of these accounts will do wonders for the church. Nate Saint, Jim Elliot their compatriots, and family are heroes to modern Christendom, and therefore should be offered to our children as such. Our children will lead the body of Christ in the years to come and they should be inspired by men and women of faith and courage. Give your child a &#34;hero&#34; that cared about nothing more than spreading the truth of Jesus Christ.  The Fate of the Yellow Woodbee may be a suitable introduction for your pre adolescent child.

Abiding by the heritage of the Sackett family to support, protect , and honor other Sacetts, this band of three strong men rush away from all of their own interests to help Logan.  Very little is known of the circumstances surrounding his call for a herd of cattle, but it doesn't matter; when a Sackett needs help, Sacketts come running.<br />If the drive itself were not enough of a challenge, the Sackett boys find that they are hindered by local political upheaval and uncertainty about some of the hands they've brought along for the drive.  There are also some unknown and unseen antagonists along the trail.  Are these bandits or is this a part of the conspiracy to do Logan Sackett harm?<br />L'Amour adds his trademarks; intrigue, suspense, and romance.  Wonderful imagery and Louis' excellent knowledge of his subject make this a great all around book.  There is a special historical note from Louis in this book.  I'll leave this for you to enjoy on your own.<br />One additional note on the Sackets.  I believe Louis L'Amour was attempting to create, through his work, a bridge between the way things are and the way he thought things should be.  <br />Take the Sackett loyalty.  This isn't a quality that one finds very prevalent in today's society.  Kinsmen find themselves out of contact with one another for years at a time until their relationships become as dry and destitute as any old west ghost town.  Not so the Sackett family! Sacketts care and Sacketts come running when the call goes out.  They give no regard to self preservation or comfort, they simply go anywhere, anytime for the good of the family and close friends.	2003-11-28

I don't believe he ever wrote a bad book.  No, I'm sure he never did.  Some of the books are similar, some are vastly different.  He proved himself able to write more than &quot;just westerns&quot;.  Louis' depth is seen in books like Last of the Breed, The Walking Drum, and Hills of Homicide.<br />The book is interesting in that the lead role, Johannes Verne, is without full time adult supervision from a very young age and with the help of friendly indians must provide for himself.  From my recollection this is the youngest character of L'Amour's to &quot;go it alone&quot;.  In this way, this book is similar to Reilly's Luck ( another youngster alone).<br />This book seems to take a look at eternal things.  There is mention of God and the story line is developed along the idea that many gods have existed through time.  Men come and go and their gods are left behind with no one remembering who they are or what purpose they served.  Unlike God, they are lonesome and left with no followers or those that look after their shrines.  Johannes Verne identifies with them out of pity for there lonliness.  <br />Although somewhat predictable, I say &quot;who cares&quot;.  L'Amour's work is excellent.  The reasons we love it are the imagery, storytelling, and the close bond we feel with the characters.	2003-10-28

We all know we're supposed to get along, but for centuries we've found a way not to do that.  Today, to be the church God wants us to be, we must work together.<br />Revival in South America was birthed in the unity and meeting of pastors from around the denominational spectrum.  They worked and prayed together to see the purposes of God fulfilled in their cities and countries.  The impact was revival and awakening that changed the course of history for the Kingdom of God.<br />We've seen unity produce strength in the relationships of pastors here too.  In Ft Wayne, Indiana, dozens and dozens of pastors from Assemblies of God to Catholic meet together a couple of times each month to pray together.  If that weren't enough, they attend a three day prayer summit once a year to seek the face of God for their city.  They have united to reach their city of over 200,000 people.  The result is a unity and strenght that allows churches to work together in evangelism and ministry support.  They serve each other and are growing in spiritual strength.<br />Read Tenney's book and look for the way you can unify the body of Christ in your town.  When we all adopt the Father's dream of a unified church, we will see many more people won to the Cross of Christ than we do now in separated and segregated churches.	2002-09-28

He found it humorous when I started reading it.  \\"It's a book for Young Adults\\", he said.  That was funny for several reasons, including the fact that he considers himself a young adult.<br />The book really is not just for kids.  This is the first exposure I've had to Sutcliff.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find the high quality of her writing to be focussed on kids.  <br />This tale, wonderfully written, tells of a young man and a bad decision.  It is a terrible decision in which some one dies.  The treatment of the murder is very light.  That may be the one criticism that I have for the story.  Today, of all days, our kids need to know the very serious consequences of their actions.  The setting of this story is far removed from our own, and is probably the way it would have been.<br />Through the life events and challenges resulting from the accident, Bjarni becomes a man.

It is superbly written and easy to read. The cast of characters seems nearly endless, as even secondary characters take on great living qualities and consume the reader.<br />Reviewers may focus on King Richard, his evil brother John, or Ivanhoe, but there are so many strong characters. For instance one \\"DeBracy\\" is a stout hearted soldier of fortune and happens to be working for the ill minded John. His knightly character is challenged and defeated by the Black Knight of the Fetterlock and he quickly champions fair play and chivalric form when that defeat, by one more noble than he, rekindles his manhood and loyalty to his vow of knighthood.<br />Another character, Brian de Bois Guilbert, plays a villain and strong crusader of christendom against any foe of the cross or his own gain. Sir Brian is a member of the Knights Templar and is vexed or enchanted by every worldly thing that he has denounced . His love for a beautiful Jewish girl is completely absurd to all around him, but he is completely consumed by her beauty and purity. Willing to give up fame, fortune, and power for her; we find him nearly mad with his passion so far out of control.<br />I reccommed this book to lovers of great novels and historians alike. You won't go wrong with Ivanhoe!	2002-07-01

It creates an atmosphere of understanding the relative association of world history with today's international disagreements.  For this reason alone, it is an outstanding read for those wishing to understand where we are in the scope of international politics and moral/ethical military interventions.<br />References in the early chapters of the book to Winston Churchill, and other historical world and war leaders are appropriate and enlightening to the understanding of the subject matter.  Later references to philosophical leaders such as Immanuel Kant are far less valuable because their contributions are on a far less calculable level.  <br />For instance , Kant's opinions are based solely on self formulated views derived from the experiences of others.  This contrasts the value of today's military and political leaders that have experienced both the realities of personal experience and the insight of history.  For this reason, I consider the inclusion of philosophical viewpoints to be much less valuable to the discussion at hand.<br />This is a great book.  It is short, wordy, and cyclical.  It is also a valuable contribution because it causes a new generation to consider the mistakes and accomplishments of the past and how they can help us form appropriate international policies for today and the future.	2002-04-27

To Kill a Mocking Bird represents a handful of books and authors that are able to transport the reader directly into it's pages.  One may find that they can relate with one or more of the characters in the book, and sometimes with more than one at a time.<br />This book is about many things, and although it is very complex it is easy to follow due the similarities to life itself. Like life, there are many characters.  Some that are easy to hate, easy to love, and those that are plainly repulsive because of their disrespect for their fellow man.<br />This story is indeed about prejudice.  It paints a despicable ( but reasonably accurate) picture of the hate that permeated the daily lives of those in rural Alabama.  It also portrays the prejudice that is applied to those that are different for reasons other than skin color.  This book is also about the preservation of childhood innocence.<br />Scout and Jem enjoy a pleasure that many of us only wish we could have experienced.  That pleasure was the love and care of a father that stood for what was right to the point of his own harm.  Many of us have never known that type of uncompromising love that Atticus Finch so readily exudes.  He is a man, as Miss Maudie says, \\"was born to do our unpleasant jobs for us\\".  The character of Atticus Finch still stands as a man among men.  We could use a few like him today.<br />Jean and Jeremy find themselves subject to the harsh realities of poverty and prejudice, but they are always able to take refuge in the affection of their father. Atticus makes many efforts to protect his children.  His primary tool is truth.  He speaks openly and honestly with his children.  Again we would do well to take a few notes from Atticus.<br />The true value of this book is it's exposure of hate and bigotry, but it is valuable in so many ways.  It has more to offer than could be considered in any review.  Were it's many complex details of relationship to be reviewed and catalogued by the greatest minds in psychology and human sciences it would require multiple volumes.<br />Although I highly recommend this book, I would offer a word of caution to the reader.  The book uses the \\"n\\" word repeatedly, and I suppose that within it's historical context may be accurate, nonetheless I found it quite unsettling.  There are a number of other explicative statements, but I would suggest that they are also supplied to offer a contextual reality that would otherwise be lost without them.<br />This is a timeless and enjoyable story.  The entire human drama is put on display in a small rural Alabama town.	2002-04-15

From the perspective of the common man, I can say that I know more about the historical Alamo than ever.  <br />This book offers a broad review of the Alamo and it's place in our history as well as it's impact on our culture.  I was very impressed with this book.  I picked it up only to paw through and look at the numerous pictures and movie stills and found it to be thoroughly informative and entertaining.<br />Mr. Thompson may offer some information that distorts or contradicts what you thought you knew about the Alamo, but it's worth the exposure to his insights and opinions.	2002-04-11

George Barna continues to put out meaningful books that meet the need to cram statistical knowledge with christian insight. His personal desire to see the church mature and become healthy is evident and refreshing.  This book is no exception.  <br />Mr. Barna has provided the data and included his personal insight for our evaluation of meaningful ways to help the Body become more like Christ.  Do you want a successful church?  The information compiled in this book will make you think.  I believe that is the number one goal here.  What you did last year to disciple the Body will most likely not be good enough for this year.<br />Whether you adopt one of the models in the book or simply enhance your current system because of them your church will benefit.  Try it on a small scale and see if it brings meaningful growth.  If not, tweak it again and keep praying.  I know that the Father want's us to grow in the likeness of His Son and we need to be leading thers in that same growth.<br />Enjoy Growing True Disciples, it offers much and may be the catalyst your church needs.	2002-03-19

God has done marvelous things throughout history, and men have longed to understand them.  <br />Many believe that God is working with signs and miracles following all around the world.  We hear of miracles in South America and Africa, but we do not experience them here at home.  When we do hear of God's power in the states it is limited to a few isolated incidents, or static reports of euphoric but intangible incidents.  <br />What part of the equation are we missing?  This book may be helpful in clearing up the answers.  Wigglesworth's work is completely dependent on the Bible and the lead of the Holy Spirit.  Within it there is no divergence from God's inspired Word.  Therefore, I find it trustworthy and useful for unlocking our understanding of God's Word. <br />This isn't a book to casually read in an afternoon.  You'll need time to sit with it and your Bible, to study and understand what the Spirit says in the text of the Bible and the life of Smith Wigglesworth.	2002-03-08

Georgi Vins gave all to minister the Gospel and ultimately found his place of ministry to be the Gulag.  Under severe persecution he delivered the Gospel of Jesus to those that were able to receive it due to their stress and situations in prison.  He did it with great zeal and determination,never doubting the Lord Jesus or his need to preach.  Like Paul, it seems that Mr. Vins cried &quot; woe to me if I do not preach the gospel of my Saviour&quot;.<br />Georgi Vins should inspire each of us to do all we can wherever we are.  Taking time to lick wounds and feel self pity simply take away from our mission of preaching the Gospel to everyone everywhere.  Enjoy this book and allow it to fuel your personal witness wherever you are in life.	2002-02-09

The Family Friendly Church is the chronicle of personal discovery by Ben Freudenburg.  The discovery may seem simple but it is an area missed by many churches.  How about yours?  Ministry to children and families with young children is often overlooked and undervalued.  <br />Often when a church grows or adds staff, the first position to be filled is the youth pastor.  Unfortunately this is a plan that follows traditional practice and not conventional understanding.  One must look no further than current statistics to determine this.<br />According to the Barna research group, children are the most available to receiving and accepting the Good News.  If you are spending the majority of your church's momentum, manpower, and resource on something other than children, you may be unwisely using your talents.  Children are the future and most likely the best way to reach the adult population in your community.<br />The Family Friendly Church will offer suggestions and simple resources to reach families with children.  Employ your leaders and families in the process of building a strong Family Friendly Church.	2002-02-08

Jesus said He was the Way and the Gate to Heaven. He never said He was a way.  A Course Miracles makes the person of Jesus Christ nothing more than a way.  A Course in Miracles receives it's only credibility from using the name of Jesus.  Unfortunately it ends there.  The use of Jesus' name is an obvious attempt to attract Christians, but this book is far from Christian.<br />For anyone seeking good Christian literature, this is not it!  A Course in Miracles is much the same as other new age writings.  It is warmly presented as a great revelation of truth, but falls short quickly after you pass the dust cover.<br />If you have been hurt, ill, or lost and seek guidance from a Course in Miracles, you'll find yourself in the same place at the end.  The Hope you seek can be found in only one place and that is in Jesus Christ, the Living Word.	2002-01-18

It is bound very nicely and has an attractive cover with bright illustrations.  It is large and would serve well as a &quot;coffee table&quot; book.  The reading is easy and provides just enough information on each breed.<br />The first section of the book is alive with pictures of various dogs and instructions from puppy care on through the life of a dog.  It is well suited for a beginning dog owner due to its thoroughness and explanations of care. It is also a good selection to help you determine which breed is right for you.<br />In contrast to other dog books we have seen, this one offers several photographs of most breeds.  This is important.  That cute puppy may grow to be one ugly dog.<br />Overall, this is a very nice book that has proven itself to be informative and entertaining.  Most of all, our kids love it!	2002-01-18

The author makes several good correlations and contrasts between modern efforts and those of the giants of Christian ministry such as Spurgeon and Finney.<br />Unfortunately this work is very subjective and bent towards the author's personal preferences of preaching.  Which in this case happens to revolve around the Law or Ten Commandments.  The mid section of the book is slightly &quot;preachy&quot; but not intolerable.<br />The book offers an interesting if not eye opening review of modern Evangelical's efforts and shortfalls in Evangelising the lost.  Although I cannot agree with all of the content, it is a good book to read to maintain balance in one's own theological positions.	2002-01-12

Let their example inspire or convict you.<br />It seems contrary to our experience to think that we need to learn to pray, but it is true.  God hears us as we pay, but I for one want to move beyond &quot;just&quot; praying.

We hear all of the time how difficult it is to understand the scriptures.  This difficulty leads to feelings of discouragement and often a lack of sincere study in the Word.  Those that are walking through life without the Word are walking a dark path without the assistance that God intends for each of us           (Ps 119:105).Without God's Word we cannot understand  either the boundaries or freedom that God expects in our lives.  <br />It is so important to know the difference between reading and studying God's Word.

From slave to hero, Kerbouchard has the ability to ignite grand visions of power and nobility in any man Ladies look out, this flamboyant swordsman has stolen many hearts along the way.<br />Although L'AMOUR is known for his &quot;Westerns&quot;, he outdid himself on this work.
