A thriller?  Yes.  Fiction?  I don't know....and that's what makes it so compelling.  This is a book for a reading group because it will elicit so many more questions than there are answers and after you've completed it, believe me, you're going to want to talk about it with someone else who's read it.<br />The construct was terrific and as a result I book 2 more of O'Brien's books immediately.  While both were good, neither matched the plot, suspense, and tempo of In the Lake of the Woods.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but I especially think Vietnam Vets could really relate.<br />Now, I'm off to try Tomcat in Love.  Since O'Brien can write the serious scary stuff that only nightmares are made of, I want to see what he can do with humor and love.<br />What a find.  I'm so glad I found this book listed in Bas Bleu because I hadn't seen it hyped anywhere else.	2004-06-28

Although not a complete Lehane fan, based on some of his other novels, I decided to give Mystic River a read before seeing the movie.  I was not disappointed.<br />This was powerhouse writing at its best.  It's hard to call this simply a good mystery novel when it is so much more.  It contains a complex, penetrating and melancholy plot that delves into some of the moral issues of our day.  It reaches deep into the blackest of hearts and searches out the haunting results of childhood innocence lost.  This book isn't just about child molestation, thugs, crime, mystery, and petty criminals.  It's about evil and innocence, friendship and betrayal, love and guilt. It's about how our childhood experiences mold us into the adults we are, regardless of how hard we might try to fight it.<br />This is a gripping tale and I found myself constantly going back and re-reading several passages to ensure that I fully understood all the plot twists and turns.  Truly it is disturbing and there is ugliness in it, because there is ulgliness in human nature--and that may put off some readers.  However, Mystic River represents a book that is well-written and intelligently plotted with good dialgoue. I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime or mystery novels.	2003-11-10

I picked this book up during a very difficult time in my life, right after my Mother died.  It attracted me because it was about Mothers and Daughters, and I was missing mine and needed a hidey-hole to forget about my present circumstances--motherless! Although I did not read the first book, I would recommend this book to every girl who has a mother and every mother who has a daughter.  There's a lot of life, love, misery, and joy between these pages and the traveling pants, while seemingly nonsensical, made this book a delight!  Take a chance, read the book, regardless of your age or gender.  I think you'll find you've made a wise decision and the tugs on your heartstrings will help you remember that you're still alive, even if, like some of us, the most important person in the world is no longer available to share it with you!  Thanks Ann Brashares for making my life more bearable at an awful time!	2003-10-15

I bought this book on the basis of the title Closing Arguments and the hype &#34;a superb piece of courtroom drama..&#34;  This book is neither.  It has little, if anything to do with action in the courtroom and the &#34;closing arguments&#34; leave more questions than answers.<br />That being said, this book is an amazing look into the psyche of one rather disturbed dysfunctional male, who happens to be an attorney.  However, that is the only thing about his life that is real--nothing else is. In fact, his own past is somehow mired in the dark side of abuse, betrayal, and destruction.<br /><br />While his wife, Schelle, tries to help him deal with a past she neither knows nor understands (by dedicating a Vietnam Memorial in their hometown), Marcus chooses another remedy.  He decides to exorcise his demons with the help of his current client, herself a sexually dysfunctional mess.  His plan is to leave his family the &#34;Closing Arguments&#34; and his bloody corpse.  It is the only way that he can see to extricate himself from the lifetime of lies that he has foisted upon his family, himself, and the community.<br />I must say, I was put off by all the sexual exploitation that occurred between Marcus and his client.  It was only after I had completed the book and rethought the plot, that I realized it is indeed a finely crafted novel.  I don't think I'd want too many more of these in a row though, its very dark and disturbing.  But, in the final anaylis, it's worth the read.  I will try anothr Busch novel before I make any final decisions on whether his writing style is something I want to spend a lot of time on.	2002-09-10

But, if you see the movie without certain expectations, you will truly enjoy a great movie and great acting.<br />Then go sit down and absorb the book on all levels, as it is the movie and so much more.  You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll be annoyed, angry, and confused, but you'll never be bored.<br />I can't believe that there are some reviewers that absolutely hated this book.  I know it takes all kinds, I would like to know what kind of books they do find entertaining.<br />All through the book, I could hear the words reverberate through my mind in the exaggeratd Southern drawl of Siddha's momma.  By far, one of my best summer reads.  Great characters, dysfunctional lives and the scars they create, forgiveness, fun, and futility--the very essence of life is contained within the pages of this novel.  Don't miss it.	2002-09-09

Great characters, nice magical references, but it appears Alice got to a certain page and decided to wrap it up.  No ryhme, no reason.<br />The plot did not deserve this ending.  I'm left feeling very unfulfilled.  I'm not even certain of the reason for the name of the book, let alone why one of the better characters is killed off early on and we're not ever given a satisfactory reason. And then other characters appear but don't seem to stay around of have any purpose, like Sean Byers.<br />And Betsy running away with Abe????  The pharmacist suddenly discussing everything with his wife.  This isn't the result of magic, but lack of imagination maybe?  None of the actions or character/plotline prepares the reader for the way Alice wraps up a tidy little ending, unfit for the great beginning.  Quite a let down.  Did Alice run out of steam on this one?  I won't give up on Hoffman, but this was not her best effort.	2002-09-09

Russo is an artist when it comes to character development, but the story left me weary when I realized Miles was never going to take full responsibility for his life--sometimes I wanted to shake Miles.  Scenes and interchanges between Miles and those who populated his life were hysterical at times and predictable at others.<br />All in all, a good read, but the ending was a bit contrived, too tidy.  Russo does a good job painting the &quot;regular joe&quot; who takes life as it comes, and doesn't take life by the throat--a fault we all engender at times.<br />I enjoy the way Richard Russo develops his characters and I found myself caring for all of them, not just the &quot;stars&quot;, but even the minor characters were well drawn and loveable.  It definitely seemed like a slice of small town America. I would definitely recommend the book and I'll read Russo again.	2002-09-09

However, there was nothing new in this book.  The man does get around socially and subsequently, he gets his story.  While Dominick Dunne speaks with an honest voice, he's still singing the same old tune.  Maybe I'm tired of hearing about OJ?  I remain baffled about the title because Justice was certainly never accomplished for many of the rich and famous of which he writes.  Ho Hum...	2002-09-09

As an avid reader of Nazi-related fiction and nonfiction, I found this book totally captivating.  Little did I know about how far the Nazi regime reached into other countries, cultures, etc.  The writing is so compelling that I had to remind myself that I was reading a fiction crime novel and not a true story.<br />The double track (1941 vs 1990s) storyline is compelling and accomplished seamlessly.  The characters are developed in such a manner that you will despise them, ache for them, or want to kill them yourself.  I can't see how anyone could finish this novel without generating deep feelings towards the characters and their activities.<br />Tautly written, but violent and steamy.  May be too much for the weak of stomach to imagine that human to human interaction can be so heartless and cruel.  For those who cling to historical or personal revenge, grip tight for an engrossing, intellectually wrought rendering that will leave you squirming and reading late into the night.<br />By far, this was one of the better books I've read this summer.  If you don't mind tension and edgy flawed characters, and how the sins of the past haunt the present, then you'll want to pick up a copy of this gem.  Staring human nature in the face can be a terrifying experience, even from a distance, but Wilson has managed to pull it off.  I'll be looking for more of Robert Wilson in the future.  I highly recommend this book.	2002-08-07

I felt that all of the characters were believable and for the most part likeable.<br />I did have a little bit of a problem getting around the fact that no one but the mother noticed that Katie was pregnant  And, I also question whether, upon waking, a young girl (even an innocent Amish girl) wouldn't have been astounded and curious about where her new infant had gone.<br />I was hoping for more in the court room and found the final settlement a bit trite.  I'm too cynical to believe the justice system works this way.<br />All in all, this was a quick and interesting read.  I will buy another Picoult book because I did enjoy the character development and the research that went into this novel.	2002-06-24

Griffith knows how to draw the reader in and then POW! deliver the 'ol one/two sucker punch.<br />Aud is a delightful character--multifaceted and real.  Girffith develops the book in such a way that I can see the cabin surrounded by trees, feel the breeze, and smell the dirt while in the next instance I can feel the grit of New York City, hear the blaring noise, and feel the sun glaring off the asphalt--all within the space of a page.<br />Although the premise of a hip know-it-all type like Tammy being sucked into a mindless slave may be hard for some to believe, it struck a real nerve with me.  I faltered a little on the way Aud disabled the dirty rotten scoundrel, as details were sketchy, but for such a minor oversight, who cares.... The rest was brilliant!<br />This book, on so many levels, is extemely well written and absorbing.  It touches so many feelings from grief to brutality, yet expounds on each so that you won't feel cheated by any of the characters or emotions that will roil through you as you suck this novel down.<br />Now, I guess I'll have to go back and read some of Giffith's earlier works.

I know there will likely be a sequel, but even if there isn't one, I appreciate the fact that Frasier did not feel compelled to wrap the ending into a tidy bow.  She didn't need to go off into a romantic ending nor make everything end perfectly.  Instead, she mimics true life.<br />Her storyline was creative and unique.

I was truly impressed with MacDonald's ability to weave the story line and characters together into such a rich and dynamic book.  It's got something for everyone, though I don't imagine everyone would appreciate this story because it deals with issues that some of us don't want to read about.<br />I loved the characters and MacDonald has a way of making you feel their emotions, their pain, their joy, their confusion, their cruelty, their regret.  I would recommend this to anyone.  In fact, I loaned my copy to a friend who doesn't get a chance to read for entertainment, since she goes to school and works full time!  I know that once she starts this and gets caught up in it, she'll not be able to finish her homework until she finishes the book!  I hope it doesn't mess up her GPA, but this is definitely a book worth recommending.<br />Come on Ann-Marie, give us another one.	2002-03-28

I thoroughly enjoyed Brett's novel, even though the ending left me wondering what would happen next.  I enjoyed the gutsy Ruth and her unforgiving attitude about what her parents had endured.  Sometimes she seemed to go over the top and I would think--\\"Lighten up!\\", but the overall effect was necessary for her character.<br />I loved her Father, who made me laugh and remember my grandparents, also from an East European country, who (although they lived in the states for many years) still pronounced many words in their wacky endearing way.<br />The Hoss character I still can't put to rest. But, it made the novel interesting, even if I don't quite understand why Brett used this device and what we're actually supposed to assume he was.  Was he just the imagination of an overwrought angry Jewish woman, determined to relive her parents pain?  Whatever.  Hoss still provided an avenue for Brett to give us another perspective that would otherwise be unavailable to today's writer.  And, in that sense, I applaud Brett's imagination.<br />I did feel Brett cut the ending short, making me think there must be a sequel coming.  But maybe this is just another one of her devices to keep the reader wondering and thinking about the book.<br />There were any number of coincidences in the book that could be seen as too fantastic to believe.  But, even so, this was a really great read!  Very deceptive title, especially for the nonreader.  My husband was very curious because I don't read \\"romance\\" novels and he couldn't figure out what kind of book I was reading late into the night!<br />Keep 'em coming Lily!	2002-03-28

Paniccia did a great service for any woman that may be thinking of filing a sexual discrimination suit.  Especially, if they already have filed suit and have a lawyer who is not forthcoming about what to expect.<br />There were some areas of interest that I personally have that Paniccia did not cover, but overall this is a worthy read if you're contemplating a lawsuit.  It will prepare you in many ways and this type of preparation is necessary in order to survive a lawsuit of this nature.  No one but a woman who has endured sexual discrimination or retaliation could understand.<br />Whereas Paniccia's case was outright and obvious with her \\"mommydom\\" memo, there are many women, I believe, who are constantly enduring discrimination only in more oblique/obtuse ways that can easily be covered over or explained away.  This is especially true in today's society where I do not think the court system is favorable to the individual.  Finding a lawyer who is truly dedicated to your cause and remembers that it's your case and you lived it is very important to succeeding.  These types of lawyers are few and far betweeen.  What with case loads so high, and the push by firms to take clients that can make big settlements, these cases often don't get the attention they deserve.<br />Maybe if they made the settlements higher, more lawyers would be inclined to take the cases and then maybe there would be less tolerance in the workplace for this type of behavior.  Right now, it's still a good 'ol boy system and as long as it is, they'll make and break the rules as they please!	2002-03-27

I'm titilated.  Afterall, not every author could blow your socks off on the last page.  I'll even admit that after I finished the book, I went back and reread the first chapter again, picking up on things I'd missed before.<br />I definitely feel this book could keep a reading group debating for hours.  And, that is what makes for a great read--something that haunts you, makes you think, even curse, question your sanity, or question the author's sanity.  But anyone who reads this completely through and comes away with a &#34;ho hum&#34; attitude is either brain dead or decieving him/herself.  You'll either love it or hate it, there isn't much room for complacency in this novel.<br />It did remind me a little of the movie Momento in terms of starting at the end and working backwards and finally wondering what actually happened.  Writing in reverse order (from ending to beginning) like Shreve did cannot be easy and for this alone I applaud her.<br />Don't listen to the naysayers.  Give this book a chance.  And if you're convinced you understand it completely, drop me a line!  You're someone worth talking to....	2002-03-27

Janet Evanovich's series with Steph Plum just keeps getting more and more hilarious and fun! Janet has the ability to draw characters like few other suspense thriller writers of her genre. I particularly enjoy the fact that they don't have perfect hair or leap over tall buildings in a single bound, but instead they find themselves in ridiculous situations that bring them the humanity and commonality that is so frequently missing in suspense novels. There is none of the perfect chisled characters who are wise beyond belief. But instead, we get Plum, her granny, her sexual desires, her cousin Vinnie, and failed attempts that make for great reading escapes and enjoyable entertainment. Be careful not to read this one in a public place because you'll find yourself bursting out loud with laughter and either someone will wrestle it away from you or they'll clear extra space for you.

I was disappointed to see the first reviewer give this book only 1 star and suggest to other readers they should pass it over.  I felt that this was a great twisted plot, although at times the characters were a bit thinly drawn--however, who really knows what childhood events can turn one into a raging sociopath?  Certainly there was a lot of thought, and unique devices employed by Margolin in his storyline.  I was really ready to be entertained and escape from the everyday work world and this certainly did it for me, keeping me up two nights in a row so I could find out if I had the killer figured out.  Of course, I changed my mind twice, but I caught the slip made by the madman long before Amanda did--but it was easier from the outside.  All in all, a good get-away summer read.

That being said, the premise was a great one and the idea was inventive and not overdone.  However, overall, I would have preferred a few more blemishes on the characters and more chill, less thrill and less of a feeling that I was looking at a hyped-up soap-opera.<br />There were some nice twists and turns, but I was anxious to get to the end, so I could find something more substantial to read.

While I admire Patricia Cornwell's writing style and her heroine, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, I almost didn't make it through this thriller.  It was only because this was a hardback edition of a gift that I perservered.  I'm glad I did, because after the first third of the novel, with its morose introspection, it finally takes flight.  With some twists and turns, many predictable, the novel takes hold of the reader and the romp is pure &quot;Corn&quot;wellian!<br />Still, I think Cornwell has nearly reached the bottom of the barrel in her escapades with Kay.  It's time for a new, more compelling heroine who doesn't have a niece that is brilliant, wealthy, forceful, lesbian, ex-FBI &amp; ex-ATF, helicopter-piloting, &amp; fitness-obsessed.  It's just a bit too much of a stretch...  Same old, same old!  It's time to reach down and find some new material.  But, based on the ending, there will need to be a least one more Kay Scarpetta to tie up all the loose ends.  But then, please Patricia, put your enormous talents into something fresh and untried!  Your talent is bound-up, let yourself go free!	2001-01-28
US	49779392	R3FFQH2WHFW7QE	0515129240	591307244	Harmful Intent	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Crackling Court Drama	This author moves right to the top of my list of proficient authors of gripping ripping great courtroom drama!  Wow!! Finally a book that appears to be based in reality!  I was riveted from start to finish and felt a connection with the entire cast of characters!  The molding of humor, tragedy, and legalese was flawless.  This is one compelling, quick-paced novel that you don't want to miss, especially if you're getting tired of all of the writers whose characters are constantly leaping tall buildings in a single stride.  Baine Kerr brings back morality, reality, and about as much justice as one can get in this world. Like Baine says: &quot;Trial is an imperfect alternative to bloodshed.&quot;  Keep 'em coming Kerr!!  I'll be waiting...	2001-01-12

While I had some trouble first getting into the book due to the myriad of characters, I liked the plot concept, so I perservered.  I was not disappointed.  Once I was able to get all the characters straight, this was non-stop action with an ending that delivered!  The characters were believeable and not so glam damn perfect as to be boring.  Even the romance angle was well-written.  Hats off to  JC Pollock for a tightly written suspenseful gripping trip through an often written about genre!  I will look for more of Pollock's work as this book was entertaining, complicated, and intelligent.  Much better than a Clancy novel!!  Kudos Pollock!	2001-01-11

I did not read &quot;Durable Goods&quot; and did not realize this was a continuation.  However, Joy School took me back to a younger, more innocent time of my life and for that alone, it was worth the read.  While this is a pleasant way to spend time in a waiting room or on an airplane, it's not a book that will stick to your ribs.  It's simply a pleasant companion for an afternoon and then its gone.  This is very unlike other Berg books that I have read and loved.  While not her best effort, it's still fun to read. &quot;Talk Before Sleep&quot; and &quot;Open House&quot; are much better Berg novels and will stay with you for sustained periods after the final page is done.  Still, I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from picking up Joy School--I'm sure you'll enjoy it, you'll laugh, you might cry--but you will be moved emotionally at some level.  This is one great author!  Her simple prose and straight from the heart writing is such a welcome relief from some of the often painfully contrived popular writers of the day.  Keep em coming Elizabeth!	2001-01-11
US	49779392	RW7YW209ZDA9I	0684823438	526098515	Rock, Paper, Scissors	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A Good First Attempt, but...	I must be getting too picky, cuz I like my thrillers to be realistic and I like the weaver to complete the picture.  This novel, while a good first attempt is not great.  The characters were a bit too over the top--General Buck Perry, cold blooded killer?  Sarah Peterson's rise to the top of her field, but after her first day on the job of protecting the Secretary of State, she spends the rest of the novel solving the kidnapping.  Seems like her boss would have noticed her absence?  The double cross by Grizz was predictable, but added the necessary opportunity for a display of fire power. However, even the shoot-out at the lighthouse, while off to a great start, was disappointing in the end.  And, how about Walter?  How come his snooping for Sarah never gets him in trouble.  He seems to continually tap and peek into places that got his lab friend killed, yet he's allowed to satisfy all of the questions Sarah can't get to on her own.  Finally, the letter at the end did not blend with the story line and appeared too contrived.  I'm not sure why it would even be included, unless Steve Samuel wants an easy sequel?  Samuel has some great scenes and some white-finger action in this book, and he shows great promise.  I hope he'll not take the easy way out next time.  I prefer my heros and heroines to be a little more down-to-earth and real, not the untouchable glitz that we can get from Hollywood.  Keep trying Steve, you're almost there....	2001-01-06

In fact, I'm not too sure what story he's telling.  Is this a story about Bundy, about the Green River Killer, or about Keppel.  On all fronts, it falls far short, is very fragmented and hard to follow.  Worst of all, it left me unsatisfied--I still don't know anymore about Ted Bundy than when I first started the book.  I would hardly say that Bundy reveals his secrets in this book. I would say instead, that Bundy takes Keppel on a boring self-absorbed ride through his own speculations about getting into the mind of the Green River Killer.  What you do see is Ted Bundy as a bloated pontificator of the worst kind!  Keppel fails to get from Bundy what he promises and as a result I feel the book did not deliver! Save your money, there are better true crime novels about Bundy than this--I hope!	2001-01-06
US	49779392	RMZE133L3UD7H	0375506039	878470234	Open House	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Another Blissful Berg!	Elizabeth Berg is truly one of those great writers who brings joy and humor to any tale she writes about.  This particular novel was a delight--sad, funny, poignant, true, and triumphant in every sense.  Don't miss this one, it has something for everyone. Don't be put off because it appears to be a story about a middle-aged woman going through a divorce--it's sooo much more.  Do yourself a favor, and take time to read this fast paced novel by a great artist. You won't regret the time you spend with Elizabeth's characters, instead you'll wish you knew them personally.  This story will stick to your ribs for days to come.	2001-01-06
US	49779392	R2MTNZPFMFZJXG	042516019X	545051235	Masquerade	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Nice, but over the top!	Gayle Lynds definintely has some talent, but as an avid thriller reader, I found her plot and characters too unbelievable--in fact I felt as though I were reading a cheesy romance writer's attempt at murder and mystery.  Everything was just toooooo contrived, from the CIA head, to the Carnivore, to the look-alike cousins, to the clown disguises, to the evil doctor.  For me, this was not a &quot;page-turner&quot; and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome.  Unfortunately, the ending was also lame.  I believe Gayle will get better with practice and I would recommend this as a good airplane or waiting room read if you want something glitzy that doesn't take much power of concentration.	2000-12-28

This was an engrossing tale of the darker side of our judicial system. Regardless who committed the murder, Roger Coleman did not receive a fair and just trial. While we will never know the truth, it seems that many miscarriages of justice occurred throughout this long process and there are many who will atone for Roger's death--the judge, the defense team, the prosecutors, the Governor and his staff, the Appeals Courts, the police and investigators, and the Almighty Supreme Court.  The one aspect of the murder that was never discussed was the motive for the crime, assuming Roger was the murderer?  Well written and worth the read.	2000-12-10

This book, however well written it may be, left me feeling like I was caught in Dubus' fog and standing on his quick sand.  I forced myself through the first half in the hopes of finding something morally enlightening or spiritually uplifting.  I was NOT to be rewarded. This book continued its downward spiral until the very end.<br />I found all of Andre's characters to be stereo-typical, the men--macho and controlling, and the women--weak and helpless.  Even though Kathy had serious issues, and Mrs. Behrani was a product of her culture, these 2 at least attempted to deal with the &quot;ownership&quot; of the home in an honorable way.  Unlike many readers, I did not find Mr. Behrani honorable or noble.  No man that treats women like he did is deserving of respect, regardless of what his cultural teachings may find acceptable.  And, Lester, was the typical bully, hiding behind his badge and feeding his need for excitement through a veneer of helpfullness.<br />Mr. Dubus uses an engaging style and his writing is good, but this book had no redeeming value for me.  Character development was weak for Kathy and Lester.  I felt like I was starting the book somewhere in the middle where I should know why Kathy's mother and brother found her a loser and why her husband left her.  The entire experience was not unlike eating cotton candy.  It left me feeling sticky but still hungry.  Now, I have to go find a &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; book.	2000-12-03

I was impressed with Thayer's ability to develop so many tightly written characters capable of drawing the reader into their lives and into the action.  Not a wasted word in this crisp WWII Nazi thriller.  The dialogue was tight, the characters well developed and the &quot;hero&quot;, Jack Cray while relentless and ruthless is also honorable and noble--not an easy task to wrap into one character and still make him believable. Thayer did an excellent job!  Put this on your &quot;to read&quot; list.	2000-11-23

For those of you who are intrigued by the political machine and the inner workings of Washington D.C., this book will not disappoint.  Baker gives an exhaustive, balanced, and readable account of the actual impeachment process.  It was a bit nauseating to know that partisan politics are more important to our country's &quot;leaders&quot; than doing the right thing and taking the high road, regardless of the outcome.  It may be time for another political party to arise and it's past time for the American people to arise and make their elected officials accountable for their actions.  Very well researched,...  Everyone should read this book--regardless of their political affliation.	2000-11-18

Unlike many authors, DeMille is not a formulaic writer and each book covers a diverse topic requiring intense research.  His acumen for finely drawn characters and breath-holding suspense are evident in Cathedral. Although not as good as Charm School or Word of Honor, still this is worth reading.  Keep 'em coming Nelson.	2000-11-18

His style and ability to draw the reader into the very midst of the action is a rare and appreciated quality.  This book resonated with me completely; perhaps because I've always believed there might just be a &quot;Charm School&quot; out there.  After this book, I went back and read each of DeMille's books.  This one remains among the top 2 of my favorites by this author.  Don't let this one get away, it will interfere with your daily functions because you won't be able to stop reading - then you'll want more...	2000-11-18

By far one of my favorite DeMille books, this one grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end of the story. If only every book I read could be so compelling.  I've been handing down my books to my father, who is a voracious reader and the last time I gave him a carton of books, he went straight for the DeMille novel.  It's hard not to get hooked on this talented writer!  For a non-stop read, pick up this paperback, you won't regret it.	2000-11-18

For anyone who is a fan of Baldacci's suspense novels, this may fall far short of your expectations!  I grabbed this one hot off the press because of my preference for Baldacci's literary susspense style.<br />After recognizing Wish You Well was a complete departure from his previous works, I decided to keep an open mind, since it appeared Baldacci has been wanting to try a different genre.  I came away disappointed, however, in what I considered a rather pat, shallow story.  Though the potential was great and the characters worthy of exploration, David falls short, leaving me with a feeling that it will take him additional attempts before he can touch the human spirit via this type of novel.  All of the ingredients were present in the novel--it just didn't go deep enough.  Perhaps David tried to put too many of his ideas into one book and wound up doing only an adequate job.  I wouldn't discourage him from future attempts, as he'll undoubtably get better at this type of writing.  In the meantime, I hope he returns to the suspense writing for which he's earned an admirable reputation.	2000-11-12
