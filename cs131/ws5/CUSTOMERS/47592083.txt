It makes me laugh out loud, and for about half of \\"It's in His Kiss,\\" her talent shone through.  However, about the middle of the book, it devolves.  First, I was TOTALLY UNINTERESTED in the mystery of finding Gareth's grandmother's jewels.  As another reviewer asked, were there no Italian dictionaries available?  Second, Gareth's attractiveness diminished, the longer the book went on.  Afraid that Hyacinth and her family will break off the engagement if they find out his secret, he decides to compromise Hyacinth by seducing her, knowing it would lock her into marrying him.  I kept telling myself that THIS was when Gareth realized that he truly loved her, when he realized that such an act would dishonor her, but no such luck.  Instead, we have the same-old, same-old sex before marriage--let alone previously Hyacinth sneaking out--repeatedly--in the middle of the night to help Gareth find the jewels.  Unbelievable.  Third, Gareth's \\"love\\" for her is shown in his anger at her endangering herself by her coming to his apartment, etc.  Excuse me, but this rang hollow, once he risks her well-being by  seducing her.  Don't these heroes ever think, \\"What if something prevents us from marrying (my getting sick or dying, for example) and she produces an illegitimate child?\\"  Such a line of thought would indicate real love, to me. <br /> <br />To summarize, I suggest you get this book from your library and go read something in your pile of unread books.	2005-09-05

I'd give \\"Match Me If You Can\\" five stars--and then some--if it had been written by someone less talented.  But if you have a fabulous writer, like SEP, she has already established her own higher standard.   She is competing against herself.  Unfair?  Maybe, but I'm going with it.  I liked her other \\"Stars\\" book better, especially \\"Heaven, Texas.\\"  <br /> <br /> Let's get the weaker stuff out of the way first:  this book needed to be tightened.  It needed editing.  It needed a sharper focus.  For example, I was bored by the match-making of Annabelle's grandmother's clients.  A page or two to show Annabelle's generosity, etc. would have been more effective.  Her matching of other people should have been condensed too.  Although I liked Heath and Anabelle, I wanted more scenes with just the two of them.  And I got impatient with Heath, especially by the time he thought, for a while, that another woman was the right one for him.  That came too late in the book, AFTER he and Annabelle had made love.   <br /> <br />What I loved about the book:  the humor.  Gee, what a surprise from SEP--great humor!  You can't praise SEP enough for this; except for Jennifer Crusie, no one does it better.  (They are about equal, in my opinion).  I liked the sub-plot of Portia's romance.  As a matter of fact, I would have loved to have read a whole book about her, but because she lacked a sense of humor, I suppose that would have been difficult.   I loved the fact that both men really came to love, love, love Annabelle and Portia.  I loved Heath's desperation and decline when Annabelle would not marry him. And I give an A+ to the difference of interpretation of Annabelle's family party.  At first, I was a little disappointed that Heath apparently did not see their dismissal and belittling of Annabelle, in the face of his need for a loving family himself.  But, because of SEP's skill and depth, when he saw the reality of their love and protection of her that she was blind to (and OUR seeing it), it was like refocussing on an optical illusion. I also found Pippi, the three-year old, very cute, but not cloying as children are often portrayed.   <br /> <br />To end this review, my advice is:  if you've never read SEP. read \\"Heaven, Texas\\" or \\"Nobody's Baby But Mine\\" first.  If you're already a fan of hers, buy the book.  Or if you're not willing to spend $16 or so, get it in the library.	2005-08-23

The characters were inconsistent and not very well fleshed out.   Noah's step-mother is supposed to be a woman from hell, who viciously  made his life unbearable when he was a kid, but instead, she pretty much is portrayed as a snob.  Katherine's mother is supposed to be abusive and oppressive, but instead, she just appears to be someone who denigrates her daughter, telling her \\"I told you so.\\"  Katherine's desire to leave her totally seems unwarrented.   Noah is so silent much of the time and his thoughts are not told as much as I would have liked.  I found myself skipping whole paragraphs that repeated--one again--the same thoughts.  Much of the conflict in this novel is both h/h assuming that they know what the other is thinking, and, of course, each is wrong.  I found myself impatient with both h and h.  Katherine especially acted pretty stupidly in one time expecially.  This novel needed to be sharper with more consisent characterization.  The plot premise itself is intriguing, but it lacks depth.  Instead of being shown characterization, we are told it.  Reading this book is like eating Wonder bread when you crave a good, crusty roll with sharp cheese.  It needed another--at least one--draft.	2005-08-01

Theo, aptly named (\\"gift from God\\") is just a little too perfect--he was a medical student who dropped out when his parents died to take care of his retarded brother.  Not only is he perfect physically, he has instant compassion and sensitivity in dealing with Lucy.  Although I liked the book, in my opinion, it was not as good as Susan Donovan's past books.  For one, there was no real animal character (that she does SO well!).  Also, there really was very little tension or conflict between Theo and Lucy and I found the sub-plot of Lucy's boss's sabotage attempt to be awkward and intrusive.  I personally wonder, if Ms Donovan wanted to show ambivilence about weight loss, why she didn't show more realistic conflict from relatives, friends, and acquaintances.  This book is not as funny as Ms Donovan's past books, but it's lovely to read.	2005-04-12

If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would, and I usually find Regencies insipid.  \\"The Accidental Dutchess\\" is very funny; some of the lines could have been written by Oscar Wilde--I'm not kidding.  It has a great hero and heroine, both of whom grow, although both begin as very likable people.  I usually intensely dislike romances written in the first person because we don't know the other people's real feelings, but Benson does SUCH a good job here, that you know what Harry is feeling.  I thought the plot was just enough not to overpower the characters, and I could not see how (other than leaving the country) Benson could resolve the central problem of avoiding the public scandal, but she did.  I am hoping she'll write a sequel.	2005-03-08

If you combine the wit of Oscar Wilde, the elegance of Cary Grant, and the rogue-ishness of Humphrey Bogart, you have George, the hero of \\"The Fortune Hunter.\\"  Against him, plot our heroine, a combination of Katherine Hepburn and Greer Garson.  Part of the fun of a romance is the knowledge of where it is going and what will probably happen, but not exactly.  You know the hero will partake in the villain's fall, rescue the heroine, and choose her over all other temptations.  The romance staple of the \\"bad\\" man who virtuously warns the heroine against him, becoming more and more charming as he falls deeply in love is irresistible, like \\"The Fortune Hunter\\" itself.	2005-02-01

So, misled by the blurb and a violent title (shame on the publisher!), I didn't read this light romance for days.  When I did, I liked it, more than I thought I would.             <br /> <br />   Like many of you, I don't like first person point of view in romances because you don't know what the hero thinks or feels.  However, we knew Wyatt's POV all the time by his expressions (he scowled), actions (he pulled her out of his chair and into his lap),  his expressions (his face was deathly white after seeing Blair nearly killed) and dialogue (\\"I love you\\"). However, I wanted to see the meeting of Wyatt and Blair's former husband, the snake, but couldn't.  In short, the POV was not a problem because of Linda's writing skill in her portrayal of Blair, such a fun character, similar to Susan Elizabeth Phillip's.  And, oh yeah, note to other reviewers:   it's not fair to authors to chide them for trying a new technique, when it works. Without something new, authors either repeat the same book (boring), become stale, or stop writing all together.  Although I wish Linda would continue to write new novels like \\"MacKenzie's Mountain,\\" I respect her for branching out.  <br /> <br />    I can't give this book five stars because it's not a keeper. Although I reread it as soon as I finished, I probably won't do so again.   I also wish it had included the bread pudding recipe.  So, do yourself a favor:  buy the book and read it on this cold, dreary (in R.I., anyway) Jan. day.  It'll probably make you smile.  And maybe even laugh. <br />	2005-01-17

I was hoping that \\"Derik's Bane\\" would have the same charisma as the werewolf stories in Davison's \\"Secrets\\" books.  And it did start out that way, with Derik's provocation of Michael setting off a fight, possibly to the death.  However, so much of this book was unbelievable that it was like chewing cheap gum that won't hold together.  For example, the deadly attackers who fail to assassinate the heroine--they fall over, etc.--make no impression not only on her, but apparently also on the rest of the hospital staff.  No one seems even upset.  In fact, no one in the hospital seems even to notice the deadly attempt.  No one calls the police.    It's as if a group of rowdy boys have misbehaved. The characterization was very uneven and \\"jerky,\\"  not smooth.   Yes, the dialogue is funny--Davidson is rightfully famous for that.  I laughed often. The hero and heroine fall in love and I just didn't care.    You might,  But then again, you probably won't.	2005-01-12

Suzanne Brockmann reversed the personalities, interests, and the decisions made usually by a husband and wife, but she does it without making the husband a wimp who you are \\"supposed\\" to like, but really don't.  It is the husband, in this novel, who loves to dance, who sacrifices his career (although not really--Cooper is a famous architect who can work from home) to revolve around his wife's.  It's the husband who definitely wants children, and it's the husband who not only really bonds with them, but stays at home to care for them.  It is Cooper who wants to talk about their relationship.  Josie, his wife, is not as likable--a rigid, inflexible work-a-holic who has developed a bleeding ulcer.  Didn't like her (her inflexibility ran on too long), but adored him!  Although I wanted them to \\"work it out,\\" in real life, I would have told Cooper to ditch her--that there are better women out there.  In short, although I liked the book, I didn't LOVE the book--as I have for other Brockmann's.	2004-10-30

First, it takes FOREVER for Charlotte and Joe to get together--over 90 pages!  Of course, that's not really fair because we get flashbacks repeatedly of their first--and only--meeting.  So, we have to read of both of them dithering to friends about what they, now living next door and both spying on each other,  will do when they actually meet!  Somehow, I never was able to get over that Charlotte, a virgin on her way to picking up her boyfriend at the airport and knowing that he will propose that day, stops off in a rest area for a \\"quickie\\" with an unknown motorcyclist.   Susan Donovan tries to frame this act of betrayal, in my Victorian (?) opinion, by  endlessly exploring the difference in sexual needs of Charlotte and her now dead husband.  In Susan's past books, there are animal characters who made me laugh, and the men especially were great--conflicted, but great.  I didn't feel any great attraction to Joe or Charlotte, and, except for his great name (Hoover) the dog was boring.  To be fair, though, the book did keep my interest, I just wanted a lot of it edited out.	2004-06-05

I like Shannon McKenna's other books, mainly because she draws a great, conflicted--gentle but excitingly forceful--hero who really comes to love the innocent, loving heroine.  Yeah, it's been done lots of time (99% of romance books), but there's something fundamentally appealing about this set up.  Her erotic scenes are great, great, great!  What I also liked about \\"Return to Me\\" was that there wasn't a lot about the villain (there was too much, I thought in her past books) , but he was interesting.  His having only a few public faces that didn't ring true was fascinating.  However, note to Shannon:  although you didn't go into it much, the villain's past sadism involving animals (yeah, I know it's true in real life) was painful, and I was grateful that you did not go into any detail about his past burn victims.   However, I never really understood how pictures were taken of the Vietnam atrocity and what the uncle had done to deserve the thanks of Vietnamese guide.  To be fair, it may have been my fault:  I inhaled this book.  I also would have liked to see Brad's actual courtship of Cor and an epilogue for Simon and El,  but then, when I like a book, I always want to know more.  So, if you like a tortured, but loving and sexy hero who finally totally commits to the heroine, this is the book for you.  Buy it:  it's worth the money!	2004-05-31

First, let me tell you that I could read only about 100 pages of &quot;Invitation to Seduction,&quot; so I can only tell you why I didn't finish it.  I like Lorraine Heath's other books--at least most of them--but I found it totally unbelievable that in Victorian England, Kitty--terrified that she will imitate her mother who had her out of wedlock--would  allow a total stranger within five minutes of meeting him to fondle her, regardless of his physical attractiveness.  Now, as a reader, I readily accept unbelievable events all the time.  It is the mark of a successful book to establish the internal fictional  reality over the truth in the real world.  That's why I can readily accept that a kidnapped lady falls in love after one day with a noble-born, but peace-loving vengeful pirate who wrecks the ships of the man who slaughtered his family, the present fiance of the kidnappee.  That's an author's magic to make the reader accept  her version of reality.  However, maybe because I couldn't warm up to either Kitty or to Richard, I couldn't accept their instant lust which immediately causes Richard (a duke who has avoided marrying, who refuses to let his sister marry a commoner, and who disdains American women) to propose to a woman who breaks the most basic stricture to swim nude, alone, and who allows &quot;liberties&quot; to be taken.  That he would desire her as a mistress is believable, that he wants to marry her, wants her to continue his family line, after seeing her less than an hour never rang true.  Lorraine Heath performs magic in her other books, but it was missing in this one.  My recommendation to you:  pass and read an earlier Heath.	2004-05-31

That she misguidedly betrays him and his desire (which he cannot bring himself to enact) for vengeance added great internal tension.

After reading &quot;The Ideal Bride,&quot; I was looking forward to Nonnie St. George's new book which I liked, but not as much.  Like &quot;Bride,&quot; it is funny.  Her great sarcastic dialogue assumes that the reader knows the tone of voice of the character and her intent.  If you like Regencies, you will like this book a lot.  I like them, but usually find them not romantic enough, and, I admit, I miss the love scenes.  The basic plot is a duke who falls in love with a wealthy commoner's daughter whose father wants a title for her.  Although the hero and heroine fall instantly in love, neither wants the other to know, and they both play cool.   Because most of the book is from her point of view and the reader is presumably female, I wanted him to declare himself instead of &quot;playing&quot; with her affections.  Because he never really does this,( he's cool to the end), although we know she does love her, I found the book not as satisfying as I had hoped.  I kept waiting for the big scene of his realization that he will/has lost her and his dejection, self-blame and rectification of situation.   Having said that, I must say the book make me laugh out loud, although I did get annoyed at too much time with the minor characters.  However, to be fair, that's often what people love in Regencies.  It's not an intense book, but it's a light one.  Try it:  you might like it.	2004-05-05

Maybe I'd give this book three stars if it were written by an average author, but it's by Suzanne Brockmann!  Is this fair?  Probably.    The other reviewers are right when they say that Tess and Jimmy  aren't fleshed out, that you don't really feel as if you know them, nor was I drawn to them.  I have loved all of Suzanne's long SEAL books, and I bought this one, but wish I hadn't.    In Suzanne's other books, I couldn't wait for the protagonists to finally get together, but in Flashpoint, I must confess that I really didn't care.  In fact, I was much more interested in Jimmy's partner, Decker.  Plus, there was six other minor characters sent to (or native to)  this God forsaken country and the characterization was so shallow that I couldn't tell the difference between them.  And come on, we're supposed to be in suspense because the team goes to retrieve a laptop, for heavens sake!  The action climax almost occurred off the page and Suzanne told us about it, instead of showing us.  It took me about four days to finish this book;  usually I have read most of her SEAL books in one, compulsive night!  All in all, this book reads like an uninspired first draft.  My advice to you:  don't buy the book.	2004-04-03

What I love about Suzanne's books are her smart, original characters--both men and women.  However, in \\"Jones,\\" the conflict and the heroine were just too unbelievable.  Melody starts out interesting--smart enough to successfully pose as a man and worldly enough to know the true danger she's in.  Then she devolves into a one-track woman:  \\"I can't marry you, Harlan, even though you are a superman who risked your life to save me and the sex with you is fabulous.  It's true that  I am having your baby, but I don't really KNOW you.  You're not an ordinary, boring man that, for some crazy reason, I want.\\"   Even the love scenes are boring, just a few sentence flashbacks.  Harlan is determined to marry Melody, although I personally would have said, \\"Okay, you refuse to marry me.  You're right--you're too boring for me.\\"  And another thing. . . the town seems shocked, shocked at Melody's out of wedlock pregnancy.  Huh?  Do they live in the l950's?  In short, I bet Suzanne was bored by this herself when she wrote it, or, as I suspect, she wrote it quite a while ago.  The woman has surpassed this level of writing a long time ago.  Don't buy \\"Jones\\"--wait with me, for a her new book, coming out March 30th.	2004-03-11

To give you an indication, I got it from the library (not liking Crusie's last book, I wasn't willing to risk a waste of money on a hard cover) and read it. Now, I'm buying it myself!  I usually buy hardcovers once every year or two, so you get the idea.  Like Crusie's other books, this made me lol--for example, when describing Min's dad:  he was &quot;a lumbering man with a shock of blond hair and heavy white eyebrows who should have been hearty and welcoming but instead had the vaguely paranoid look of a sheepdog whose sheep were plotting against him.&quot;<BR>   So, why did I like this book?  Let me count the ways.  I loved Cal, an extremely handsome man who realizes that he loves, loves Min and that she should eat!  He defends her beautifully from her mother who is always vigilent. carping about Min to diet.  In turn, I also loved Min who considers herself fat and cannot really believe a good looking man would be attracted to her.  Yes, the book is predictable, but that's half the fun--you don't have to worry that something unpleasant will happen and you anticipate and enjoy what you know will happen--even before it does.  If you have weight issues (and how many women don't?), you'll love this book too.	2004-02-16

I look forward to having the time to read them, but I don't feel as if I have to stop my life for them.  She deftly sidesteps traps--for example, there are children in the book, but they don't take it over.  Most of this book is the two people on the run, either from the scads of people who want to kill Gatin or to reach a sadistic murderer before he can strike again.  Sometimes when an author shows a villain, too much explicit violence is shown which haunts the reader (at least, this one!),  But not so in this book.  Although this book is part of a trilogy (the third is not out yet), you can read it on its own.  Both Sarah and Gatlin are orphans who yearn for someone to love and to be loved and the process of their falling in love was fun to read.  The only criticism I have is the ongoing (two books now) flight from the man the three women thought they had murdered.  I suppose this will be wrapped up in the third of the trilogy, but it made this book seem unfinished.  On the whole, a very, very good book!	2003-11-27

First, let me say I ADORE Maryjanice Davidson's werewolf story in &quot;Secrets.&quot;  She is funny and her men are usually terrific, often more likable than her women.  I especially liked the last story (&quot;Delightful Deception&quot;) because Jimmy was loving, generous and humorously sarcastic. I loved that the heroine was nicknamed &quot;IQ&quot; for &quot;intellitence quota,&quot; as well as &quot;ice queen;&quot; however, she lost a lot of my sympathy when she planted her biological discovery in another woman's belongings to prevent it from being misused.  I would have respected her willingness to risk everything to do the right thing, not use (and endanger) another woman.  The first two stories also have problems.  The tough guy with the heart of gold lacked something and the 15 year difference in ages between the man and woman (if I remember right) made me  a little uncomfortable.  I was NOT charmed by a man who plays the lottery and is unable to pay his rent.  It's a little too cutsey that because he (a white) was adopted by a black woman, he STILL thinks that he's black.  He's not eight!   And the first story had too much acrobatic escapes and needed more romance.    One dislike:  repeated phrases  (&quot;bim&quot; instead of bimbo, and &quot;kick him in the 'nads,&quot; etc.) used by more than one character.  Maryjanice needs to make each character  unique, with no repeated dialogue, etc.  She manages to create a great romance within the novella format--something that many authors are unable to do.	2003-10-07

I usually like sexier books, but the plots are so interesting, the characters so entirely likable, if not lovable, and the details so flavorful, that I loved this book.  For once, the heroine did not do stupid things;  she was level headed and loving.  Although I was frustrated that Ian did not express his love for Anne (assuming, with cause, that he was about to die), I did not feel \\"Oh, come ON!  You expect us to believe this impediment?\\"  Sometimes romances' impediments are so stupid that no one would allow a misunderstanding, etc. to continue, but Gayle Chase does not write that.  Another reviewer said that the ending was unbelievable, but I disagree.  A good novelist's job is to create a world in which unrealistic events happen all the time and if she's good, the reader accepts them.  I accepted that Ian and Anne overcame their many difficulties.  I only wish Chase had written more after they achieved happiness.  All in all, even if you don't usually like regencies, this one is a keeper!	2003-09-08

Like most Suzanne Brockmann's fans who have read her SEAL books, I rushed down on the 15th and bought  \\"Gone Too Far,\\" afraid that she wouldn't be able to continue her combination of tough--but tender--heroes and smart women, along with a crackling plot.  Oh, me of such little faith.  I should have remembered Brockmann's other SEAL books, each with interesting characters who are not just retreads of the same old, same old, unlike some authors I (and probably you too) could name.  Although she had a minor subplot of a romance during WWII, it was not as much a part of this book as those in the past.  How she made Alyssa's rejection of Sam believable, yet not annoying, is beyond me.  It must be talent.  What I really, really love about her books is that the hero really really loves his woman.  Sam is the usual attractive mixture of tenderness and sexual aggression, with a deserved arrogance.  The only criticism--minor--is Brockmann's recapping of  the entire plot in Jules' report to Max at the end.  Brockmann should have more faith in her readers \\"getting it.\\"  Oh, by the way, if you want to see the mostly resolved relationship of Max and Gina, it's here too!   Bottom line:  BUY THE BOOK!  It's a keeper.	2003-07-16

I'm new to Maggie Osborne, having read (and loved!) two other novels of hers last week, but I expected &quot;Prairie Moon&quot; to get better, and it never did.  After reading about 1/3 of it, I remembered my tried and true rule:  give the book a good chance and if it doesn't get better, don't assume it will.  I just read the end to satisfy my curiosity (Yes, I know this is forbidden by the &quot;rules,&quot; but get real!  Reading is supposed to be fun and there are too many great books to wade through a dud). Bottom line:  if you MUST read it, get it from the library!	2003-03-19

The good news is that the romance between her two main characters is her usual great; no one can write tender love scenes like McNaught.  The bad news is that it takes about 200 pages to get going.  I am not a mystery fan, but I don't believe those who are would be interested enough to keep reading and the romance is too long in coming.  I wonder, tho, at the talent of McNaught to make the husband of the heroine slightly dislikable without this reader being able to point to something specific.  There are too many irrelevant details, describing apartments, minor characters, etc. that should have been edited out.  Bottom line:  read \\"Perfect\\" instead.	2003-02-20

When I got the book home, I kept waiting for it to take off, but it never did.  My general rule of thumb is that if a romance does not really interest me after 50 or so pages, read the end and see if it is worth it.  Even the end did not seem very good.  I may be doing Ms Dain an injustice here, but I couldn't really get going on this book.  Maybe it will appeal to you, but I doubt it.	2002-10-16

I am astounded to read that some people did not love this book!  I thought Mouring did a great job making Daegus menacing enough to provide tension and gentle and caring enough to love!

I wouldn't be surprised if I left someone out. Yes, the book was funny in parts (I think Crusie had in mind a farce), but I was so confused and the characterization was so superficial (not surprising with a list of characters longer than Gone With the Wind's--and THAT was l,000 pages) it took me four days to read this book.  Normally, I read Crusie in one sitting.  So, bottom line:  go to the library if you want to read this and if you do, print out my list of characters.  And note to Jennifer Crusie:  I'd rather wait  TWO years (if I HAVE TO) for quality, which you've done in the past.  This wasn't it.	2002-09-15

Mary Jo Putney used to be one of my all time favorites because her characters who had depth.  Like many readers, I reread books because I fall in love with the men and women.  In \\"The Bartered Bride,\\" Mary Jo picked an interesting plot, full of possibilities, but it was boring!  It had no magic, no zing!  Although there was plenty of sex, there was no passion.  I found myself not caring about either of the protagonists.  I knew I was supposed to feel sympathy for them and suspense at the various trials the hero underdoes, but I didn't.  I read the first 60 pages and just scanned the rest of the book.  It was almost as if this novel was written by the numbers by an author who was herself not particularly interested in her characters but had a contract to fulfill.  Writing is a magical process and for the last couple of Mary Jo's books, the magic has been missing.	2002-05-29

Like many, many people, I have LOVED most of Susan Elizabeth Phillip's other books, but anyone can tell that &quot;Just Imagine&quot; is a past (and outdated) book. In the 80's, it was common to have abusive, emotionally unavailable heroes, and that's what the hero is in this novel. The heroine is childish and spiteful in her obsession to obtain her family home. In short, you have two pretty dislikable characters who misunderstand, fail to communicate, and deliberately attempt to control and to &quot;top&quot; each other. In defense of the book, I did, however finish it; I just didn't really enjoy it much. Ms Phillips has come a long, long way in her writing.	2001-09-17

Anyone who can write &quot;MacKenzie's Mountain,&quot; as well as her other fabulous books, is a talented, talented writer.  However, like many romance writers, in the past few years she has shifted to mysteries, sometimes combined  with romance.  This combination worked A LOT better in &quot;Mr. Perfect&quot; than it did in &quot;Open Season.&quot;  In her earlier novels, the tension between the eventual lovers was fun and made me call the book store daily to find when they had arrived.  I, as a romance reader, feel as if Linda Howard has abandoned her loyal fans, but maybe she's all written out in the romance genre.    One of my two biggest complaints about &quot;Open Season&quot; was the total lack of tension between the two lovers.  I really didn't care whether they got together.  The book lacked something I can't put my finger on--a little spice (and I'm not talking about sex).  It was bland.    My most important complaint, though, was the final couple of pages.  Not only does Linda Howard let the major criminal who imports foreign girls (all virgins, some very, very young) into sexual slavery get away with it, she even has him show up to &quot;cure&quot; the sexual trauma of the wife of his partner!  And we, as the readers, are supposed to be touched by this disgusting, arrogant sleaziness!  Linda:  what ever could you have been thinking?	2001-08-10

I have read (and loved!) all of Pamela Morsi, but &quot;Matters of the Heart&quot; proves that even such a master as Morsi cannot make diamonds of some situations.   The hero, having recovered from childhood cancer, has hung around the heroine for YEARS, never telling her his feelings for fear of rejection.  I suspect that Morsi thought this showed his devotion, but to me, it revealed his weakness.  Then, the heroine becomes convinced that the hero is secretly gay.  I know that Morsi thought this combination would be light and funny, but with two such tentative, hesitant characters, &quot;Matters of the Heart&quot; was doomed.     I also read another novella, included in this book, and even though it was last week, I cannot remember one thing about it, except that it was work to finish.  I won't read the third.     In short, thumbs down on &quot;Matters of the Heart.&quot;	2001-04-10

Let me begin by saying I have read all of Christina Dodd's novels, but &quot;Rules of Attraction&quot; is a total  clinker.   She is one of my favorite writers and has given me many hours of pleasure.  Because of that history, when I read &quot;Attraction,&quot; I kept telling myself it would get better.  It never did.  From the time that Hannah meets her husband, from whom she has run away years before, he is abusive and threatening.  Other novelists have portrayed such dark men, but the levening agent is their deep love for the heroine. It has been almost a formula:  the love and attraction of the hero must be greater than his hurt and hostility . Ms Dodd ignores this balance and throughout the novel Dougald is potentially violent in his cruelty, both past and present.  Lacking this balance, I kept waiting for that &quot;ah ha moment&quot; when he realizes what an abusive husband he has been to Hannah and his true repentance.  That never really happened, except weakly.  After he blames her entirely for the end of their marriage, after he still continues to employ the servant who caused this break up and who still is hostile to Hannah, after he threatens to take all her savings for the past years, he then demolishes her by telling her that he was sexually using her, that he did not love or respect her.  Somehow, after weeks of abuse, Hannah senses that Dougald is doing this to protect her from a murderer, in an attempt to drive her away.  Before this truly awful moment, Hannah still is sexually attracted to Dougald and they become intimate, without any real affection between them.  In the past, I have loved Dodd's love scenes, some of which have deftly balanced the hero's force with his restraint and concern. Ms Dodd's magic was entirely missing in this novel and I advise you NOT TO BUY IT.	2001-03-13

She should be on the best seller list and there should be movies made of her books.  My favorite one is &quot;A Place to Call Home,&quot; but I loved &quot;On Bear Mountain.&quot;  I usually don't like novels where the couple are introduced as children and don't meet for 100 pages, but in her novels, the characters are so wonderful that I keep reading, anyway.  Both this novel and &quot;Home&quot; remind me of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird,&quot; not because they are about prejudice but because Smith writes about the pecularities of the south like Lee.  I found myself laughing and crying at this novel which I read in one night.  To heck with sleeping!  It took me about six or seven pages to get into, an unusually long time for Smith.  Her past books have concentrated on romance;  this one is a story of two families and their future links with art, guilt, and redemption. However, it's center is a great romance.  It is a novel that would appeal to people who like family stories, as well as those who love romances. It's a cliche that we know a book is good when we don't want to let the characters go.  It was with a sigh that I finished the book and I wish that Smith had written it longer or had written a epilogue. I hope that Deborah Smith learns to write faster, as I always adore her novels.  Get going, Deborah!	2001-02-15
