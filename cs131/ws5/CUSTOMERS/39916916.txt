How often do we see introductory text dealing with principles of design and color theory, with a presentation that doesn't require a wall of post-graduate diplomas to comprehend?<br /><br />Fifty pages covering digital cameras, scanners, input devices, printers, and data storage come next, written in a straightforward style, accompanied by graphics that are cheerful without being cutesy. \\"The Care and Feeding of Your Scanner\\" is especially useful, including advice for scanning three-dimensional or messy objects with the help of clear plastic wrap.<br /><br />Still nothing limited to the craft of scrapbooking, which is a crucial observation. Scrapbooking with Photoshop Elements is, in spite of its precise title, a general-interest primer on the basics of digital imaging. Elements enters the text at page 82, nearly halfway into this book, which shifts into high gear from here onward.<br /><br />Photoshop Elements' mighty Toolbar is explained in detail, along with some other basic attributes, and soon readers are learning how to whiten teeth, creating custom cookie cutter frame shapes, adding artistic effects to their photos, and making homegrown sports trading cards. These tutorial chapters are loaded with numbered, sequential lessons that are Mac/Windows aware. Hints and tips are plentiful.<br /><br />Scrapbooking finally takes center stage with instruction for \\"building a digital page,\\" including \\"scanning a 12 x 12 page with a letter-sized scanner.\\" Does that sound tricky? It is, but not formidably so. A final appendix assists readers in monitor calibration, something most beginners would be intimidated to pursue.<br /><br />If you've been reading this review without falling asleep, you'll wonder why scrapbooking is the dominant title, instead of, for example, digital imaging or a similarly banal term. Could it be a marketing decision?<br /><br />Adobe Photoshop Elements 3 is functionally identical in its separate Mac and Windows versions (unlike single-CD Elements v.1 or v.2), but very different in how catalogs of photos are handled. The Windows edition includes a separate component for that purpose that s-o-r-t o-f resembles Apple's free iPhoto. Adobe took Microsoft off the hook by developing Elements 3's new Organizer.<br /><br />Three thick sheets of heavy, laminated, colorful, perforated card stock contains twelve double-sided lessons from Scrapbooking with Photoshop Elements' most important interior pages. Some editor and graphics person and paper buyer devoted a lot of energy and expense to providing these cards that add considerable value and utility to an already first-rate book. Easier to use than to describe, I'll find plenty of ways to make sure my photo students become well acquainted with their contents.<br /><br />Digital photography and image editing don't need to be heavy-duty chores, as we learn throughout this high-quality book. At $30 US, Scrapbooking with Photoshop Elements is well priced, given the extent of its material and presentation. Book Bytes rates this title at a very strong 4 out of 5.be intimidated to pursue. <br /> <br />If you've been reading this review without falling asleep, you'll wonder why scrapbooking is the dominant title, instead of, for example, digital imaging or a similarly banal term.

Author Chuck Toporek immersed himself in this topic so we readers and subscribers can take advantage of his endless energy and expertise. If I attempted to create a book such as this one, working every waking moment for over six months, I could not approach the breadth and depth of coverage Chuck provides. By now you probably realize that Book Bytes considers Inside .Mac - Making the Most of Your .Mac Membership to be is as good as it gets. Congratulations and thanks to Chuck and O'Reilly Media.<br /><br />If you or someone you know has an active .Mac membership, please give us your thoughts on the service in our Article Discussion area below. This review deals with a book, not an account, and we value your personal comments.<br /><br />I spent a long afternoon reading this volume cover to cover, and I was surprised and impressed with all the .Mac features offered by Apple. Most users take advantage of one or two of the components within .Mac, notably email and Backup or iDisk, and people are missing out on several others that add value to the annual fee.<br /><br />Inside .Mac takes readers slowly and patiently from \\"Setting Up Your .Mac Account\\" on a comprehensive, detailed journey all the way through \\"Using Virex\\" and \\"Using iSync with .Mac\\" to \\"Blogging with iBlog\\" and \\".Mac's Keyboard Shortcuts.\\" Have you encountered the \\"Common iDisk Error Codes,\\" or have a need to install the iDisk utility for Windows XP? Now's your chance, with Chuck as your time-tested tutor.<br /><br />Turning to pages at random, we encounter:<br /><br />* IMAP Versus POP - Which Is Best for Me? (discussing hidden ways to access your .Mac email)<br /><br />* Blogging with iBlog (a third-party application Chuck recommends for integrating your account with a user-friendly blog)<br /><br />* From GIF to JPEG in a Jiffy (explaining why JPEG is the only type of picture compatible with .Mac's slide publishing software, and how easily you can create JPEGs)<br /><br />* Virus Scanning from the Terminal (if this appeals to you, I applaud your geek factor)<br /><br />and dozens greater and lesser techniques and tips.<br /><br />Screen shots are plentiful, all in '. At $20 US, the price of Inside .Mac is so loaded with reference and tutorial info that author and his publication team must have done this book as a labor of love, because I don't think the title is a bestseller. I hope I'm wrong, and I'll be using it on my daily rounds as a private computer tutor, urging my clients to find Chuck instead of Nemo when they need help with any aspect of .Mac.<br /><br />The text is divided into four major parts, with the first dedicated to .Mac service particulars, email accounts, and iDisk; the second addresses Virex and Backup utilities; the third (now for some fun!) covers \\"Building a .Mac HomePage,\\" the aforementioned iBlog, plus iSync, Slide Shows, and iCards; and, finally, an appendix containing .Mac's keyboard shortcuts and the error codes and Windows material mentioned above. Writing is clean and personal, like a long conversation with the most intelligent, articulate person you've ever met.<br /><br />How else is an intrepid .Mac subscriber able to acquire the necessary instructions to do everything possible with the membership and its features? Not possible, says Nemo, wishing I had an extra couple of hours each day to dig deeper into Apple's .Mac service. Inside .Mac: Making the Most of Your .Mac Membership is such outstanding value and so high in useful content that it's at the top ofour highest Book Bytes rating, 5 out of 5.

I've been using the iLife applications (Garageband excepted) since the were first released, and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that there are more good tips and tricks still to learn.<br /><br />New digital photographers and moviemakers will appreciate the review of the fundamentals of crafting good pictures and movies. If you're past that stage, skip right into the Tips section. Heid includes links to more detailed reference material in the text, in case you wish to delve deeper into the mysteries of digital photo, movie, or music making.<br /><br />The new features in the iLife applications are covered in detail, especially the new procedures for creating photo books in iPhoto 5, and the ins-and-outs of high definition video when using iMovieHD. If you don't start making more photo books after learning how much easier they are with iPhoto 5, you need a stern talking-to.<br /><br />The production values are as good as ever; The Macintosh iLife '05 is big and pretty. The DVD will appeal to those who learn best by watching, as opposed to reading. I watched the entire DVD, and was again impressed by the completely professional presentation and useful content. Several freeware and demoware applications are included on the DVD, along with a collection of GarageBand loops and a set of iTunes AppleScripts from AppleScriptmeister Doug Adams.<br /><br />The book's price has gone up by $5.00, but what hasn't? For your extra five-spot you get 70 more pages and 45 more DVD minutes. This is money well spent.<br /><br />You can easily find individual books on iLife apps that go into greater detail, but The Macintosh iLife '05 is the best all-around book on iLife that I've read; great for novices and intermediate users both.<br /><br />Most highly recommended.<br /><br />MyMac rating 5 out of 5seful content.

I read a ton of other books, though, most of which are fiction or historical in nature. But the books reviewed here at MyMac.com are Mac focused books, most of which end up on a shelf before I donate them to the local library. So it was a pleasant surprise to find Leander Kahney's hard cover The Cult of Mac in my mailbox last week.<br /><br />The Cult of Mac is a beautiful hard cover book with a slipcover. It has color pages throughout, and the text is clean, crisp, and easy to read. Not all books are presented in such loving detail as The Cult of Mac is. It really is a nice total package.<br /><br />What is The Cult of Mac about? Writer Kahney explores many subjects that can fall into the \\"Mac Users Cult\\" umbrella, including subjects such as the Newton, people who collect old Macs, the Macworld Expos, and any other oddball Mac user story that Kahney found interesting.<br /><br />The term \\"Cult\\" is not used in a derogatory manner here, even though the term does carry negative connotations. The term really comes from Kahney's Wired columns in which many of these stories originated. There were a few times while reading a particular story in this book that I remembered reading the same thing, albeit in an abbreviated form, on the Wired.com website.<br /><br />Kahney hits upon many subjects, though usually the book is focused on the extreme examples or subjects. While each story presented here is true and honest, and Kahney makes no editorial judgments as to whether the behavior is out of the ordinary, he does seem to neglect some of the core Mac user experience and relationship to the platform.<br /><br />Because this book was written over quite a few years, I found many instances of outdated information. For instance, in one story, Kahney writes about how Stan Flack is the publisher of MacCentral, even though he has not been for three years now. But later in the book, he writes about how MacCentral is owned by Macworld magazine. This suggests that older material was never rewritten or put into historical perspective to when the book was actually published. This is a little sloppy writing or editing in my opinion, but it works very well as a historical reference.<br /><br />The dated material aside, this is a wonderful book to look at and read. Many of the stories are captivating, and made me want to look up more information online of the people he writes about in the book. Pictures abound in the book, including old Macs, the different paintings of Peter Cohen's head at Macworld Expos, and the fashions people wear at Macworld Tokyo. All good stuff!<br /><br />This is one book I will set on my bookshelf and pull down from time to time to reread. This isn't a book you have to read in sequential order, as each chapter is an island unto itself. Written with detail in mind, The Cult of Mac is a large and ambitious project that was put together with loving care by the author.<br /><br />MyMac.com rating: 5 out of 5<br /><br />[...]ry, Kahney writes about how Stan Flack is the publisher of MacCentral, even though he has not been for three years now.

A LOT of them. And while most actually do convey the information you were hoping to glean from buying the book in the first place, many do so in such a dry and boring manner that I found myself simply trying to stay awake while reading. That was my worry here as well, as I have never read any of Rob Griffiths writing before. He's the creator of &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">MacOSXhints.com&lt;/a>, a site I have visited often. But that site is more a collaborative effort with a ton of other people, all pooling their knowledge together. So how would Rob do all by his lonesome?<br /><br />  Hey, guess what? Rob can WRITE! Yes sir, the man has talent! Mac OS X Power Hound is a book full of useful things that any Mac OS X user will find helpful and worth knowing. As an expert Mac user and ex-IT manager, even I learned some nifty tricks I hadn't known about before after reading a few pages of this book.<br /><br />  Does using the Terminal give you a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach? I understand, it's even a little frightening for longtime Mac users to use a command line, something that was unheard and unneeded in the past with Mac OS 9 and earlier. Even Hex-Edit or Res-Edit, the stalwarts of the Mac Hackers of the world, use a graphical user interface. But the terminal is just that, a window of nothing but text, prompting you to type in commands that Mac users would otherwise most likely avoid.<br /><br />  Mac OS X Power Hound will help the average Terminal-fearing Mac user become a Power Terminal User in no time, or at least make one somewhat more comfortable working in the innards of Mac OS X. While not a step-by-step guide, Power Hound is written in such a way that most Mac users will feel comfortable following along with all the tips in the book.<br /><br />  I usually don't get too deep into critiquing another writer's writing style, as I have a fear of people looking too closely at my own writing and realize \\"This guy really can't write, either!\\" That being said, I do want to compliment Rob Griffiths on a superb job here. He takes very complicated subject matter and writes in a style and enthusiasm I haven't seen in quite a long time. Mac OS X is a fun system to use and tinker with, and Rob brings that fun to his writing. It's obvious that he not only knows the subject matter at hand, but also enjoys writing about it. His writing style is infectious, engaging, and fun to read. I think any writer who wants to write a book on complex subject matter should be forced to read this book, and understand that it's the human voice of the book, in this case Rob's, that make the subject matter more easily understood and a pleasure to read.<br /><br />  The book is 536 pages with a well laid-out potpourri feel. As Rob says in the beginning of the book, there is no need to read this book from start to finish. The reader is invited to open the book to any page to get the information they're looking for.<br /><br />  Some of the covered topics in the book range from the simple to the complex, and include (flipping randomly through the book here):<br /><br />  Finder and Desktop tricks and hacks<br />  Screen Saver Animations as the Finder Backgrounds<br />  System Preferences<br />  Make things happen at login<br />  Connecting to the iDisk from Windows<br />  How to Rip Multiple CDs.<br />  iTunes and iPhoto tricks<br />  Check the Weather in a Contact's Town (in Address Book)<br />  Use Safari with Address Bar Hidden<br />  Get quick access to Bookmarks via the Dock<br />  Make Mac OS X feel like Mac OS 9<br />  Window Shades<br />  Unix Basics<br />  Inserting Boilerplate Text with bash<br />  Instant Double-Clickable Terminal Commands<br />Checking for Resource Forks<br />  The Built-in Unix Manual<br />  Setting Permissions on Multiple Files<br />  A Command-Line Directory Using curl<br /><br />  And a ton more.<br /><br />  This is a fantastic book. Most books I read end up gathering dust on one of my bookshelves, in the basement, or up for bid on eBay. I usually don't request books for review, as I don't have a lot of time to read through a book and write a review. There are quite a few book publishers who send me every other new book they publish in the hopes I will review it. Most I ignore after a cursory look. Most I don't review, unless I specifically requested the book. Mac OS X Power Hound was one of those books I had not heard about, and was sent to me unsolicited. I took a cursory glace through it, however, and I was impressed. There are no color photos here, there is a lot of text, and a subject matter that I'm usually not interested in as it presents no new or compelling information that I am particularly interested in reading about for the tenth time. But the broad subject matter combined with Ron's infectious writing style had me hooked. I haven't enjoyed a Mac book this much since &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">Mac & PowerMac Secrets 2nd.

Until now, I've recommended David Pogue's OS X The Missing Manual for beginners and intermediate Mac users. The nod for best advanced/expert level book has gone to Mac OS X Unleashed, penned by John and William Ray.<br /><br />I've got to add Mac OS X Help Line (Help Line for short) to the canon of best OS X books. The Ray brothers' Unleashed is geared more toward the Unix-oriented sysadmin/expert user. In contrast, Landau's Help Line is written for the sophisticated OS X end user; someone who doesn't need the plumb the Uniy depths of OS X, yet needs detailed information on complex topics.<br /><br />Landau has found the right balance: he provides 1144 pages of OS X depth and detail that \\"normal\\" people can use. Help Line does sit firmly in the \\"boat anchor\\" category (try holding it out at arm's length for a minute or so), but if there's an OS X question that you or I could pose, it'll most probably have the answer.<br /><br />I could easily list the sections I found most interesting, but this review would swell to three or four pages. Suffice to say that you can find<br /><br />detailed information on fonts (one of OS X's least intuitive areas), printing, permissions, and the OS X startup sequence. Each section has plenty of \\"Technically Speaking\\" or \\"Take Note\\" sidebars to add even more detail to particular topics.<br /><br />Like almost all OS X books, Help Line covers the basics on the iApps that ship with OS X. Don't buy Help Line for the cursory coverage it provides on Safari, for example. Buy it for the detailed background information and troubleshooting tips for networking, instead.<br /><br />Help Line's production values are very good: the screen shots are clear and legible. Sidebars are set off with background colors that don't get in the way of legibility. The binding has to hold 1144 pages together; I hope it lasts more than a year or two!<br /><br />Now, Ted may object to my characterization of Help Line not being a newbie book, saying that he's written a book accessible to all. I beg to differ. The Mac newbie will probably be scared off by the pages of detail on complex subjects, as she pages through Help Line trying to find out how to just rename a file. Pogue's Missing Manual will better serve the beginner.<br /><br />Even so, I can't speak highly enough of this book. If you want the best work for advanced/expert Mac users who seek to learn more about the guts of OS X, but not from a systems administrator's standpoint, buy Landau's Mac OS X Help Line Panther Edition.<br /><br />MyMac rating 5 out of 5gether; I hope it lasts more than a year or two! <br /> <br />Now, Ted may object to my characterization of Help Line not being a newbie book, saying that he's written a book accessible to all.

US	39916916	R32NLWWJC8BFPH	0596005784	258536587	The Best of The Joy of Tech	Books	5	6	7	N	N	MyMac.com Book Review	I must be crazy; I was flamed so badly after my last review of a cartoon book (published on a much less friendly site) that I had to replace my asbestos review suit. 'The Best of Joy of Tech' may be worth the risk.<br />Of course it's easy to enjoy a cartoon book by a pair of cartoonists that share your prejudices. It is obvious from the cartoons that Nitrozac and Snaggy are Macintosh loving, Linux leaning, Microsoft loathing geeks. Hmmm, sounds like me.<br />Not that Nitrozac and Snaggy are totally one-eyed. They still have a dig at Apple and Macintosh owners along the way. Unlike quite a lot of cartoons about tech these two also see the more human side, just as likely to make a joke about your cat's relationship to you and the computer as poke fun at LARTing end-users or pointy-headed bosses. Their cartoons are more about living with technology than working with it.<br />The book reproduces a couple of hundred of 'The Joy of Tech' cartoons from their website, in improved color and resolution. The website features a new cartoon every couple of days. There are also a small number that are original for the book and some funny marginalia in a couple of spots. It also has the matching JoyPoll and a short comment about the cartoon in a 'JoyWorld' section at the back of the book.<br />I find a fairly large number of the cartoons repeatedly funny and most of the rest worth a chuckle. These two have a good eye for the whimsical, ironic and downright funny side to a wired in, geek life. They even manage to get in a sly reference to geek site Slashdot with a fake O'Reilly book, \\"Trolling In a Nutshell\\" with a troll wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with \\"FIRST POST\\" on the cover and an Introduction by 'Anonymous Coward'.<br />Oh, that reminds me. The book has a very Wozniak foreword by Steve himself and an introduction by David Pogue that is nowhere near as good as the book (I'm sorry David, but any self-respecting geek [male or female] would rather do almost anything than edit the Windows registry, starting with install a decent operating system and working all the way through to changing jobs, heck, I'd rather sleep with Jobs.)<br />The book is broken up into various sections, each with a theme. It starts with \\"Boot-Up\\" and continues with \\"4nim4l cr4ck3rs\\" (most about cats), the whimsical \\"Geek Love\\", \\"Hacks and Cracks\\" (I loved the couple who want to get housing within 50 meters of a war-chalked wall), \\"Techie-daze\\", \\"How about them *nix\\" (featuring the luscious 'Linux Lass'), \\"The Joy of Mac\\", \\"Who do you want to poke fun at today?\\" (You'll enjoy the 'Stress Relief Dartboard'), \\"Sci-Fi The Comic Frontier\\" and \\"Do You think I'm Xexy\\" before finishing with \\"The World According to Geek\\" (with 'The Lord of The Root - One Geek To Rule Them All', the two good looking woman who don't shy away from maths and the Barbie 'DotCom Rescue' CD-ROM game)<br />If you go to Joy Of Tech you can grab a copy from the authors that has been signed (you even get a chance to ask for a custom inscription) and for an extra fee Nitrozac will even bless your book and attach a lucky sticker.

Mr. Linzmayer, a freelance writer and author, had taken his time to delve into the depths of the company that we all love to hate and produced a great book that worked to explain the mysteries of Apple.<br />Fast forward to 2004 and he has done it again. Taking the original book, Mr. Linzmayer has updated the story to the present day, continuing the journey from where he left off with Mac OS 8.6 and the original iMac to the present day Mac OS 10.3 and the G5, the iPod and iLife.<br />Apple Confidential 2.0, from start to finish, is a continual source of information on Apple Computer and the people involved, from the beginnings in a bedroom (you have to read the book to find out) to the present day activities of Steve Jobs as head of Apple and Pixar. It delves into how the original Apple was taken to numerous companies, like Hewlett-Packard, Atari and Commodore Business Machines in an attempt to sell the Apple computer concept. It covers all the twists and turns that Apple has experienced along the way. Apple Confidential 2.0 provides the reader with information on how Apple came to be, who thought of what, who never got the credit that they justly deserved, or who took the blame when things went wrong. The book includes time lines for Apple from the start of both Wozniak and Jobs in college to the computers, operating systems, peripherals and software from the very start to the present day.<br />If you want an easy to read book on the story of Apple and the people involved, get yourself Apple Confidential 2.0. The book is packed with everything you need to know, provides the background on people, and places and things, and it does so without being boring or preachy. A very good read, you'll find yourself totally engrossed. If you didn't buy Mr. Linzmayer's first book, take the time to get the second. Apple Confidential 2.0 will make a great addition to your home library - a must-have for Apple lovers.<br />Highly Recommended.<br />My Mac Rating: 5 out of 5<br />[...]Mr. Linzmayer's first book, take the time to get the second.

His latest endeavor, the fourth in his Mac OS series, Mac OS X: The Missing Manual (Panther Edition) has built upon his previous versions and takes the reader through the &quot;joys&quot; of OS X Panther. From install to Terminal use, Mr. Pogue walks you through the process of getting down and dirty with Panther.<br />Starting with what one sees when they first start up Panther, Mr. Pogue takes the reader through the basics of the Mac desktop; folders and windows, organizing things, the Dock, the Sidebar, and how to arrange and rearrange things to suit your own tastes and needs. Experienced Mac and OS X users may find things slow at the beginning, but Mr. Pogue does provide the whys and wherefores of Panther in a well-written, easy to understand manner that does make it a pleasure to read through every section. Mr. Pogue makes excellent use of hi-lighted boxes bearing titles of Frequently Asked Questions, Up to Speed, Nostalgia Corner, Gem in the Rough, Power Users' Clinic and Troubleshooting Moment to explain and add emphasis to what is being covered in that chapter or section. The screen shots also add to explaining things as you go along.<br />As you read through the book, you are shown OS X programs, the use of OS 9 in the scheme of things &quot;X&quot;, and then the components of OS X that are available with the software. You are also shown the free programs that come with OS X; Font Book, iCal, iTunes, iSync, Safari, Sherlock, QuickTime Player, to name a few, and how to make use of their capabilities. Want to import pictures from your digital camera to your Mac? Page 288 will show you how, and then show you how to share them, print them and finally email them out to friends and family.<br />Mr. Pogue then takes you into the technology of OS X and its UNIX underpinnings. Administrator and Standard accounts are shown, their setup and usage, signing in, logging out, Fast User switching, Networking... the list just goes on. Every aspect of the OS is shown and explained, from A to Z. Best of all, Pogue does it with humor, wit and a writing style that doesn't bog you down or put you to sleep, particularly when you get into the aspects of UNIX. For new users of the Mac or new converts to OS X, Unix and the use of Terminal is geek-speak to the nth degree. Bash, tcsh, pwd, Is, cd, mv, rm, srm, using man; they're explained and their usage is also shown. While you might not want to use them, it's good to have the knowledge available just in case you have to use it somewhere down the line.<br />I was a bit surprised at the amount of little gems that I picked up as I read through the book. Access to the Character Palette, keyboard viewer, storing Apple Software Updates... how many of you know that you can save that Software Update by choosing UpdateÆInstall and Keep Package? Want to play a game of chess but have no one to play with right now? Why not try playing against your Mac by going into your Applications folder, double-clicking on Chess and then choosing new game. Have a microphone available? Try using the voice-recognition feature and tell your Mac what moves you want to make where. Are you a new convert from an older Mac OS and you've just switched to OS X and you're not sure what happened to some of your favorite Mac features? Not to worry as Appendix C provides you with a complete guide as to what stayed and to what disappeared. Oh, and for the new Mac users who have switched from Windows, don't worry, Appendix D will provide you with a handy-dandy listing of what does what in OS X.<br />Oh, by the way, when you first open the book, there on the inside cover is a drawing of the Missing CD-ROM that didn't come with the book and that just saved you $5.00 off the cost. Not to fear, you are directed to go to [...] and click on the Missing CD icon. Once there, you will find links to 22 sites containing additional software that Mr. Pogue covers in the book.<br/>I really enjoyed reading this book. It is well written and covers what a Mac user needs to know to work with OS X Panther. As has been stated in the past with Mr. Pogue's other Missing Manual books- this is what should have come in the box with your Mac. But since it didn't, run, don't walk, to your nearest bookstore or online book seller and get yourself a copy of Mac OS X - The Missing Manual (Panther Edition) This is a definite must-have for Mac OS X users!<br />Highly Recommended!<br />My Mac Rating: 5 out of 5<br />[...]/>I really enjoyed reading this book.

Some people prefer graphically-oriented books that use little text, like the Visual QuickStart series. Others prefer text-heavy books with few graphics. Jim Heid has successfully split the difference with The Macintosh iLife, an interactive guide to iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD. While Heid uses the most recent versions of these applications (iTunes 3, iPhoto 2, iMovie 3, and iDVD 2), owners of older versions will still be able to enjoy the book.<br />The Macintosh iLife (hereafter referred to as TMiL) consists of both the book AND a 90-minute DVD disk. With iDVD being one of the focal points of Apple's suite of iApplications, it only makes sense to include a DVD with the book. While you can read and profit from TMiL without owning a SuperDrive-equipped or DVD-reading Macintosh, you won't be able to enjoy and profit from the lessons on the DVD. To my knowledge, TMiL is the first book to include an instructional DVD, and author Heid, Peachpit Press, and DVD producer Avondale Media have gotten it right.<br />  Heid's target audience is the person new to the iApplications who likes to read more than a few lines of instructional text, but also likes to have screen shots for to clarify the text. TMiL is not targeted at the aspiring expert; it does not delve into the subtleties of QuickTime Pro, or how to share iTunes libraries across a network. TMiL does an outstanding job of setting out the fundamentals of using each of the iApplications, along with pointers to better use each application. TMiL easily passes what author Bob LeVitus (Adam please link to my review of LeVitus' Little iTunes book) calls \\"the Dad test\\" (would you give this book to your newbie father...?), as it is written in clear, jargon-free English.<br />  What truly sets TMiL apart from its numerous competitors are the production values of both the book and the DVD. Measuring about 9\\" x 9\\", the book is big and pretty, and the extra space is full of large and gorgeous color photos; no tiny washed-out black and white screenshots here. TMiL has the best illustrations I've seen in a computer instructional book! The DVD is no cheesy home movie; it's a professionally done effort produced by Heid and Avondale Media. The video lessons complement the book, although Heid omits some of the more detailed steps and hints from the video, referring the viewer back to the book. You could get most of the benefits of TMiL by either reading the book, or watching the video, but doing both will work best. Reading and watching will give the iLife newbie a firm knowledge foundation to draw upon.<br />The ... list price is a screaming deal, as many smaller computer books list for more, and don't even include additional material. The TMiL DVD alone could be worth the price of admission for some buyers.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />David Weeks  ...petitors are the production values of both the book and the DVD.

This trade paperback-sized volume is stuffed full of very useful suggestions to improve your OS X skills. While hard-core Unix converts to OS X may scoff at the some of the beginner-level \\"hacks,\\" there are plenty of fun tricks for novices to intermediates, and challenging techniques for intermediates to experts. The varying range of hack sophistication and difficulty is one of the best aspects of this book: you can start with the easy tips, move on to the moderate tricks, and hope someday you'll be geeky enough to work the magic of the most exotic Unix-based feats of skill and daring.<br />  The tips and tricks are sorted by subject; Files, Startup, Multimedia, User Interface, Unix and the Terminal, Networking, Email, the Web, and Databases. To help the reader decide which hacks to try, each one is rated Beginner, Moderate, or Expert, and is illustrated by a small thermometer. The higher the mercury, the more expertise (usually Unix) is called for. Be sure to check the temperature, as you may find an expert hack right next to a beginner hack.<br />Now, don't get scared off by the \\"U-word.\\" Dornfest and Hemenway do a creditable job walking readers through the exact Unix steps needed (if any) to do a hack or trick. But, caveat lector; if you jump into deep water, you might be in over your head. Mistype some Unix commands in an ?ber-geek hack, you'll sorely regret the fact you don't have enough Unix knowledge to truly understand the cookbook-style instructions. While ten pages of Hacks are devoted to an overview of commonly used Unix commands, after reading it I felt I knew just enough to get into serious trouble. So, exercise caution when typing. You'll soon find out that Unix has no \\"undo.\\" But, good backups provide the courage to try new things!<br />  Still too scared to try Unix? Morally/spiritually/philosophically opposed to command lines? Be at ease! Dornfest and Hemenway give plenty of fun mouse-based suggestions to learn how to do great slideshows, run an Internet radio station, modify the standard Desktop look and feel, and more. Just experimenting with the beginner-level hacks and the recommended shareware/free applications will be fun for many readers, so don't pass by Mac OS X Hacks just because you are allergic to Unix!<br />  Warnings aside, the power of Unix combined with the Mac OS is a thing to behold. Executing just a few simple Unix commands can add tremendous capabilities to your computer; email servers, sophisticated Web server functionality, neat user interface tricks, and many more.<br />  &Uuml;ber-geek wannabes like myself will be tantalized by all the neat things that require only a modicum of Unix; SSH remote logins to another OS X Mac, running AppleScripts from the command line, running FTP servers, even setting up a Web DAV server (like an iDisk).<br />  Later, when I get my nerve up, I'll dive into the hacks to run the built-in Apache web server, as well as the Sendmail mail server, and experiment with setting up cron jobs to run tasks on a regular basis.<br />Mac OS X Hacks is a book you can live with for a long time, as few readers will be jumping into the expert hacks right away. You can come back to Mac OS X Hacks time after time, and find some new tip or trick to play with.<br />  Production values are typically O'Reilly: outstanding.

While almost every Internet searcher is familiar with basics of Google searching, there's far more to Google than meets the eye. Google Hacks tells individual Web searchers and Web site programmers how to best take advantage of Google's tremendous amount of searching power and flexibility.<br />The first three chapters (Searching Google, Google Special Services and Collections, and Third-Party Google Services) are targeted at the end user. They present a wealth of detail about how to access Google features most users didn't know about (myself included): wild cards, date range searches, spell checking, phone book, translations, and more. You'll learn Google has special directories of images, newsgroups, and mail-order catalogs. (I made sure to NOT tell my wife about the on-line catalog feature!)<br />The balance of the book is for web site programmers. They get plenty of tips and tricks about how to incorporate Google search technology into their web sites. While many of the tips are not for novice web programmers, most intermediate webmasters can spruce up their sites with the tools presented in Google Hacks.<br />The production quality is typical O'Reilly, and that means good! Clear screen shots, and crisp dark type make this read easy on the eyes.<br />If you want to learn how to exploit Google searching, or want to add Google search features to your web site, Google Hacks 100 Industrial-Strength Tips and Tools is a good place to begin the learning process.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5&lt;P	2003-04-24

I usually have a tall stack of books in the [Mac] review pipeline, and new additions are added to the bottom of the pile. Sometimes it takes titles a while to surface, but when Ted Landau's Mac OS X Disaster Relief arrived, it went promptly to the head of the pile.<br />When I began reading the actual troubleshooting sections, I began to worry.<br />\\"Did I make a mistake upgrading to Mac OS X?\\"<br />When I was half finished with the troubleshooting sections, I worried some more.<br />\\"Maybe I made a mistake owning a Macintosh.\\"<br />By the time I finished the book, I was really worried.<br />\\"Maybe I should just get rid of all my computers!\\"<br />After reading page after page of gruesome OS X problems, I felt spooked. But after a cup of warm milk, I remembered that I'd never seen many of these gremlins, and probably never will. My OS X installation runs well most of the time. But I have had troubles that took quite a while to eradicate. I wish I had Mac OS X Disaster Relief close at hand before my last experience with a disk I could not unmount.<br />Mac OS X Disaster Relief is not the kind of book you buy to get a warm and fuzzy feeling about OS X's incredible stability, and how its bulletproof Unix foundation never crashes. You won't find any of the marketing happy-talk that spews from the depths of Apple's PR machine.<br />What you will find is page after page of specific and detailed fixes to both common and uncommon OS X problems. Ted Landau knows his stuff; he is probably best known for the creation of the MacFixit web site, and for his Sad Macs, Bombs, and Other Disasters. Sad Macs dealt with OS 9 troubles, and Mac OS X Disaster Relief is a more-than-worthy successor.<br />There's no fluff in this meaty book. My brain was working overtime on many pages, thinking about the variety of different problems and solutions. Landau devotes comparatively little space to OS X overview, except in places where a fundamental understanding of OS architecture is needed. While there is the usual discussion of Aqua, and OpenGL, the bulk of Chapter 4, Understanding Mac OS X, is spent on a thorough exposition of the contents of /Library and /Users/\\"Home\\"/Library. Each folder, beginning with Application Support, and ending with StartupItems, is covered in detail. While this information could be found by consulting MacFixit, Macintouch, Apple's KnowledgeBase, Mac OS X Hints, and Google.com/Mac, your Mac would be obsolete before you found it all. Mac OS X Disaster Relief is the best compendium of \\"what part does what job\\" I have ever seen for OS X.<br />Before reading Mac OS X Disaster Relief, I thought I knew a bit about OS X. I should, after plowing through over a dozen OS X books, each one saying it is the best in the field. But Landau is the first to say OS X has at least 7 ways of crashing at startup. (Apple does like to give the user flexibility...) Chapter 5, Crash Prevention and Recovery presents the startup sequence in slow-motion detail, and you learn exactly what happens (and what can go wrong) at each step in the process.<br />Crash problems are mercifully left behind when you arrive at Chapter 6, Problems with Files: Open, Copy, Delete, and Beyond. One of the first \\"gotchas\\" that drives an OS X newbie to run screaming from the room in frustration is the inability to empty the Trash, or to even put files into the Trash. Fixing Trash headaches is kid's play for Landau, and you'll learn several ways to solve this problem.<br />The best part of Chapter 6 is the lucid discussion of aliases, symbolic links, and hard links. Not being a Unix geek, I never understood the differences between these three \\"pointers to files\\" and how they differed from Mac OS 9 aliases. Landau set me straight in less than a page.<br />I could easily recite how useful the Troubleshooting Printing, and Troubleshooting Networking, File Sharing and Internet sections are, but that would be redundant. Every section is good, with golden nuggets of knowledge throughout.<br />Obviously, I love this book; its the best OS X book I've read since I reviewed David Pogue's OS X The Missing Manual. My copy of this masterful work is already dog-eared, and I've had it only three weeks. Mac OS X Disaster Relief is a MUST addition to any OS X user's library. You can read it straight through, from start to finish, as I did, or you can use it as a reference for when you encounter trouble. Either way, it will be worth far more than what you paid for it, as Landau will certainly save you time, probably save you money, and maybe save you some hair loss.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of ...ut.<br />Obviously, I love this book; its the best OS X book I've read since I reviewed David Pogue's OS X The Missing Manual.

For most folks QuickTime is just an underutilized streamer of web media. But there is more to QuickTime than a player the latest Lord of the Rings trailer, under the brushed metal facade lays a power packed Swiss army knife of multimedia manipulation. Of course you'd never chance upon just how much you could do with QuickTime by playing clips off the Internet because the true utility of QuickTime is hidden from view. That's where Judith Stern and Robert Lettieri step in, they reveal all of QuickTime inherent niftiness in \\"QuickTime for Macintosh and Windows\\".<br />So just where can you go with QuickTime? I'm glad you asked. The following represents a small sampling of tricks gleaned from the aforementioned \\"QuickTime for Macintosh and Windows\\":<br />Go movie Crazy:<br />Picture in Picture<br />Groovy Masking for movies<br />Add a media skin (forget brushed metal, you could have brushed hair)<br />Or the very cool but probably useless: Wrap your flick around a cube (texture mapping)<br />Movies aren't your thing? What are you smoking? QuickTime is not done yet.<br />Go Audio Gonzo:<br />Change Volume, Balance, Bass and Treble<br />Make your own tunes with the synthesizer<br />Sub custom sounds into the synthesizer<br />Convert file types<br />Of course there is much more to QuickTime and, hence, much more in \\"QuickTime for Macintosh and Windows\\" than mentioned above. You also get the more useful, if more mundane, information. Information like preparing your movie, audio, etc. for the web.<br />So how is all this data streamed so to speak? If you're familiar with Visual Quickstart Guides the format will feel like slipping into an old sneaker. That said the visuals are pretty useful. The differences between the Mac interface and the Windows interface are nicely illustrated though some color plates would have been nice. My biggest complaint about the book is the pace in the early chapters. \\"QuickTime for Macintosh and Windows\\" moves fairly slowly for the first five chapters covering stuff you know if you ever brushed up against someone who actually used QuickTime to watch a movie trailer. Other than that quibbling \\"QuickTime for Macintosh and Windows\\" is a solid effort.<br />If you're thinking of buying this book because you're stumbling around trying to listen to an audio stream over the Internet don't. If you're looking to put your movie on the web and stream it via QuickTime well then \\"QuickTime for Macintosh and Windows\\" is a solid choice.

The middle of the content gets into some Photoshop and ImageReady techniques that have application in Web design. There are a few tutorials that some readers may find helpful in reinforcing concepts.<br />Maybe my expectations were confused by the title, but I found Adobe Photoshop 7 Web Design to be disappointing in its treatment of Photoshop as a Web design tool. The focus of the book's substance seems to be on the left brain area, to the detriment of any creative potential that might otherwise be discovered.<br />When I want to educate myself in the technical areas, I'll buy a book devoted to that subject; to pursue the potential that Photoshop offers in Web design I'll search for a book that focus on the creative. There is really very little in this volume that does that and there are other books that do it better.<br />If your basic desire is to understand, for example, color depth, information architecture, content authoring, image compression, the LZW algorithm, and similar topics, Adobe Photoshop 7 Web Design should probably be in your library. They are important matters but ones I don't want to deal with when I'm in a creative mode.<br />So therein lies the reason for a negative evaluation. What I expected from this book, based on its title, was 300 pages of Photoshop techniques geared to the artistic Web designer. Instead, I found more of an overview of Photoshop fundamentals sandwiched between lots of technical information.<br />There is no accompanying CD so any images needed for tutorials or experimentation must be downloaded. Nor is there any demo of GoLive software, which would have been helpful, since a good portion of Adobe Photoshop 7 Web Design with GoLive 6 deals with this application. There are portions of the book that are very well explained and others that are labored and awkward.<br />Because of these disappointments it would be hard to recommend this book to any serious or aspiring graphic artist other than for the purpose of acquiring a broad perspective on Web design. Those who want a more creative approach would be better served elsewhere.<br />Attractively presented but lacking in important content<br />MacMice Rating: 2 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Wynne Stevens ...wnloaded.

Digital Photography for Dummies contains just about anything you need to know about the world of digital cameras: storing images, transferring images, printing etc. and a bunch of (well marked) trivia you'll never use but you'll be glad you read....<br />It seems digital cameras and taking photos with aforementioned equipment isn't quite enough to fill an entire book. To skirt the lack of material afforded by concentrating solely on the taking a good picture and being done with the whole mess Digital Photography for Dummies includes plenty of pages spent on various digital image-editing programs. This may seem odd to those of you who are used to the way some traditional photography books read (many focus on getting the picture right the first time) but once you accept the benefits of going digital the inclusion of methods to manipulate the image is necessary. As Julie Adair King notes: you can make a pretty average picture into a pretty good picture if you spend a little time with a decent image-editing program. Don't believe Julie Adair King? That's okay Digital Photography for Dummies is packaged with a compact disc that contains a bevy of useful software including a Photoshop Elements demo so you can actually see for yourself just how powerful digital photography can be.<br />One of the better features of Digital Photography for Dummies is the photo examples found throughout. Julie Adair King's visual examples are the best use of figures I have ever run across. Every point Julie Adair King makes with a figure is very well made...Digital Photography for Dummies also includes something that I once thought I would never see in a twenty-five dollar digital photography book: Color Plates. Jammed right into the middle of Digital Photography for Dummies are sixteen pages of color plates. These pages are particularly informative and you're not going to get close to Digital Photography for Dummies's level of instruction with a book that is entirely grayscale.<br />Still, Digital Photography for Dummies has some miscues and errors. I'll focus on one: Apparently Photographers are ignorant to the standards of science...on the whole the book is very good. The inclusion of color plates is outstanding and Julie Adair King's touch with the visuals is remarkable. Go to your local bookstore and toss any books without color plates in favor of this one...d you're not going to get close to Digital Photography for Dummies's level of instruction with a book that is entirely grayscale.<br />Still, Digital Photography for Dummies has some miscues and errors.

If you work in creative applications on a PC (as I do, I'm ashamed to say) you will feel woefully inadequate and be convinced that life has passed you by. Perhaps this is a slight exaggeration. However, David Coursey presents many compelling reasons for making the switch in this well written and entertaining book targeted to disgruntled Microsoft captives.<br />Interspersed throughout the book are interviews with individuals, many of whom were in the recent Mac switcher ads, who describe their various reasons for migrating to Macs (including some PC horror stories). The testimonials are quite convincing and, I believe a clever way for Mr. Coursey to shield himself from the heat which Microsoft would surely direct his way otherwise. They are real world experiences and probably completely biased, but present all the good reasons to make the switch.<br />Early chapters describe why people switch and how relatively easy it is to do. There is a brief description of the Mac GUI and corresponding hardware components such as USB and FireWire ports, modems, memory and the like. The author describes how to move files from one OS to the other and includes a rebate for Move2Mac, a program that does all the hard work. The chapter on the Mac desktop and its comparison with the Windows equivalent is particularly good. The Internet and email on the Mac are also covered extensively.<br />Later chapters deal primarily with software applications: iApps that come with the machine and other Windows-type programs that have Mac equivalents. There's even a description on how to run Windows and/or MS Office on a Mac, although why anyone would want to is beyond me. If there's a weakness in the book, it's here.<br />While we can run spreadsheet and word processing on the Mac, that's no real reason to switch. I'm led to believe it's with the creative applications that the Mac really shines, and there's little in Mac OS X for Windows Users: A Switchers' Guide that addresses how or why these programs work better on the Mac.<br />In my case, I got entrenched in the PC world of DOS with AutoCAD and, later, 3D Studio, for which there was no acceptable Mac alternative at the time. These can be highly creative programs that are still the software of choice for the architects that I know. In order to be on that wagon, I had to have a PC and went through all the machinations (no pun intended) from one version to the next of both software and operating system.<br />Along the way I added Photoshop, Illustrator, PageMaker, AfterEffects, Painter, Dreamweaver and other PC programs. Now, in order to switch, I have to buy all these programs over again in Mac mode. Nowhere in the book is there an answer or discussion on this dilemma.<br />Nevertheless, for the price, this is a great book for those with only recent PC history or limited Adobe PC applications to evaluate what is really an easy choice. It sure convinced me and I may just spring for the Mac Photoshop software anyway.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Wynne Stevens<br />[local website]here's little in Mac OS X for Windows Users: A Switchers' Guide that addresses how or why these programs work better on the Mac. <br />In my case, I got entrenched in the PC world of DOS with AutoCAD and, later, 3D Studio, for which there was no acceptable Mac alternative at the time.

Books	5	29	33	N	N	Wynne Stevens MyMac.com Book Review	Adobe Photoshop 7 One Click Wow<br />by Jack Davis and Linnea Dayton<br />Peachpit Press<br />90 pages, all in color<br />CD included with supporting files and samples<br />ISBN 0-321-12531-2<br /><br />Review by: Wynne Stevens<br />One Click Wow is one of those books we struggling want-to-be computer artists see in bookstores and fall in love with at first sight. The accompanying CD alone contains a smorgasbord of Photoshop styles, actions, and other effects that can make anyone look good with virtually no effort at all. Obviously true artists and Photoshop experts may look upon this with some disdain but there's no denying that One Click Wow exemplifies software automation and productivity to the delight of the unskilled such as myself.<br />This book contains the tools to take a simple graphic and convert it to chiseled steel, chrome, plastic, glass, neon, wood grain, and on and on. Want a frame or special edge treatment for that photograph? How about textures, edges or photo enhancements? Need some dynamic rollovers? No problem.<br />The authors present the various included effects with a simple clarity that makes it possible to start experimenting immediately. Once hooked, the process is addictive and a truly great way to explore the incredibly vast range of image effects that are possible with Photoshop.<br />The main focus of the book is on Photoshop layer styles, various effects that can be applied or unapplied to individual or groups of layers within an image file. It starts with brief introduction describing concept and customizing in terms easily grasped by any novice. The reader is encouraged to load the styles and begin experimenting immediately and there is a tutorial for the timid.<br />In the course of observing how each style (and there are literally hundreds) is constructed, and how components (opacity, pattern, shadow, stroke, texture, et. al.) are mixed, one really begins to understand the power of layer styles. Through experimentation, the book's styles can be altered and re-saved to suit any individual preference. This is where the real value lies -- one has both a vast library of new presets and the means to customize based on individual needs.<br />But wait, there's more! There are tons of other presets, including over 60 actions, 40 gradients, and 150 seamless patterns with full color examples of how each is rendered on a simple graphic. It's a lot of fun and a great education for those of us who are unsophisticated in the many ways an image can be manipulated. The CD alone is worth thirty bucks -- the fact that there are 90 pages of text and color examples is a bonus.<br />I recommend this book highly, especially to novices, as an excellent introduction to the power of Photoshop in image enhancement. Many of us have the program and don't really know all it can do. Spend a day with this book and you'll have a new appreciation. Definitely:<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />Author Jack Davis tells Book Bytes:<br />I want to emphasize the Wow Art Media Brush Presets and the Wow Image Fix Brush Presets -- over 70 of the most mind-bogglingly useful brushes (and associated paper and canvas textures) for thoroughly exploiting the capabilities of Photoshop 7's new Brush Engine. Those topics start on page 78 of the book.<br />Users of Adobe Photoshop Elements can participate in the Wow revolution by purchasing and using a companion book, entitled:<br />Adobe Photoshop Elements One-Click Wow!<br />by Jack Davis and Linnea Dayton<br />Peachpit Press<br />ISBN 0-321-10847-7, 58 pages plus companion CD loaded with images and tools<br /><br />* If readers are using Photoshop 6, they won't be able to take advantage of the new Tool Presets on the Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow CD, but this would still be the book of choice because of the greater number of Styles.<br />* If they are using Photoshop Elements, the Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow still offers more Styles, but the Elements One-Click Wow tells how to use Styles with Elements, which is a little different process than using them with the full Photoshop.<br />In both cases, the printed book includes examples of all the Styles and tells how to use all the goodies supplied on the CD-ROM, including the tutorial files.<br />Here are the differences in more detail:<br />Adobe Photoshop Elements One-Click Wow! - which was the first one in this series - has more than 300 Layer Styles (instant stunning, practical effects for photos, type, or graphics) that can be used with Elements or Photoshop 6 or 7. It also has Recipes, which are exclusive to Elements (since Adobe has changed the way Recipes work in version 2 and the Wow Recipes were designed for version 1, the Recipes on our CD don't work with Elements 2).<br />Adobe Photoshop 7 One-Click Wow! has more Layer Styles - about 250 for type and graphics and more than 75 for photos, all of which can be used with Photoshop 7 or 6 or with Elements. It also has 150 custom button styles for use in Photoshop 6 or 7 or ImageReady; in addition, there are 50 combined Rollover Styles, already automated for use in ImageReady. Besides more Styles, the other major difference about this book/CD package is that it takes advantage of Photoshop 7's support for custom Tool Presets. For instance, it has more than 60 custom art-media tools for turning photos into watercolors, oils, pastels, and other media. It also has photo-retouching presets: dodge-and-burn brushes, red-eye fixers, teeth-and-eye whiteners, and skin redness removers. There are also presets for the most-often-used cropping dimensions, more than 40 Wow Gradients, and over 150 custom seamlessly tiling Patterns and Textures.

Well, they would be if it weren't a dictionary. Fortunately I am reviewing a dictionary, Webster's New World Computer Dictionary to be precise. What you have here is your basic dictionary: Words and acronyms in bold followed by the definition the whole shebang flows down two columns per page. The difference is the focus, Webster's New World Computer Dictionary focuses solely on Computers so the reference won't be much use to scrabble players looking for a two-letter word that starts with Q (answer \\"qa\\", it's legit, trust me).<br />Reviewing a dictionary is difficult. The obvious things to do is read a bevy of definitions and see if they are understandable or if they send the reader off to another dictionary to figure out what Bryan Pfaffenberger is trying to say. Having read more definitions than I care to enumerate I can honestly say they are pretty easy to follow. None of the definitions left me wondering what I had just read actually meant so that's gotta count for something.<br />The other test I devised for Webster's New World Computer Dictionary was one I hoped would test Bryan Pfaffenberger's completeness. I began to think of random computer terms. I would shout one aloud and flip the pages of Webster's New World Computer Dictionary to see if my word of the moment had stumped Webster's New World Computer Dictionary. DDR? It's in there, SLIP? Ditto, foo? Covered. Try as I might there was no computer related word/term/acronym I could come up with to successfully stump Webster's New World Computer Dictionary (though qa was not included). My failure to stump Bryan Pfaffenberger may have more to do with my meager vocabulary than the robustness of Webster's New World Computer Dictionary so take my experiment for what it's worth.<br />Now I am entering dangerous territory, valuing the book. One of the keys to rating any kind of reference book is the value component. At only seventeen dollars Webster's New World Computer Dictionary is fairly inexpensive but if you have the Internet it's fairly unnecessary. You can look up just about any term (well, probably every term) found in Webster's New World Computer Dictionary and get the same info from the net. I suppose that Webster's New World Computer Dictionary might be useful if you find yourself reading computer manuals or editing computer oriented articles and didn't want to make the short Google jaunt but, personally speaking, I can't imagine actually needing this book (I am obviously the exception to the rule, the book is in it's ninth edition). Still, if you find yourself in a situation where you need a hard copy dictionary Webster's New World Computer Dictionary won't let you down.<br />MacMice Rating: 3 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chris Seibold<br />...seventeen dollars Webster's New World Computer Dictionary is fairly inexpensive but if you have the Internet it's fairly unnecessary.

My perspective is not from one well versed in the subject but rather from your run-of-the-mill graphic artist with a smattering of understanding of the subject. That's a caveat that needs to be stated in this case. Can't say for sure whether the information imparted is accurate, current, etc., ... but it sure looks good.<br />Those of us who work with color in a variety of media have to understand how color information is transmitted to and from the monitor. Color management is the means by which consistency is achieved from device to device. It's not a subject we left brain types wade through easily but if we don't get a handle on it, sooner or later it will come back to haunt us.<br />Real World Color Management is a comprehensive study on color, from how our eyes and brains perceive it to how it's controlled. The subject matter requires pretty intense concentration to get through, but the effort is justified. The authors understand that a good portion of their market may be technically challenged and do an admirable job of gently easing us into the complexities of color science.<br />The primary focus of the book is on profiles: the means by which color information is communicated between various devices. There are input profiles for scanners and digital cameras, display profiles for monitors and LCDs, and output profiles for printers and presses. If you read all that's available in the seven or eight chapters devoted to the subject, you'll know more about profiles than normal people should, as the authors admit. I found this to be quite true; at times, there's just too much information for anyone but the most ambitious color fanatic.<br />The book goes on to describe how color is treated and managed from documents as they are imported or exported from application to application and how the Mac and Windows operating systems provide appropriate services (ColorSync and ICM) for management of color. Real World Color Management continues with descriptions of some of the more important applications that deal with our artwork (from, for example, Adobe, Macromedia, and Quark).<br />It's not a fun read. The subject matter is difficult at times but the authors do a great job of explaining it if you're willing to stick with them. They even inject occasional humor to lighten the load. These three experts come across as a bunch of good guys who really know their trade well.<br />Real World Color Management will give you a greater appreciation of all that must happen for color to be properly transmitted from one device to another. We might be able to sneak by without such comprehension, but if we aspire to be knowledgeable professionals in this business, here's a book that should be on our mandatory reading list.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Wynne Stevens(ColorSync and ICM) for management of color.

Thankfully Deke McClelland and Galen Fott have taken PSE 2 and approached it with a sense of humor that makes reading their Dummies book quite enjoyable.<br /> The authors have taken PSE 2 and broken the learning route into five different parts. Part 1: Element-ary School; Part II: Be Prepared; Part III: Realer Than Life; Part IV: The Inspiration/Perspiration Equation and Part V: The Part of Tens. The book starts by explaining the basic setup of PSE 2 and then continues on to explain the painting and image editing tools that make up PSE 2. As you continue through the book, you are taken through the steps of starting up PSE 2 and familiarization with the layout and dealing with dialog boxes, palettes and tools. Then the fun starts as they begin to get you involved with cropping, rotating, understanding color theory, color management and grayscale.<br /> Both authors continue to walk the reader through all the aspects of PSE 2, dealing with each tool, layers, color replacement and variations, retouching images, and the use of painting tools. You are also taken to the land of TYPE and the use of the tools, editing and layers. Once you've worked your way through all of the basic aspects of PSE 2, you are brought to the point of learning the automated features that are contained in the program. The Effects palette, batch processing, attaching a file to email, creating a PDF slideshow, picture packages and Photomerge are some of the topics covered. They end the book by covering 10 important PSE 2 shortcuts for use by the reader.<br />  The authors have even included a full color section so that the readers can see what you can achieve in PSE 2.

Updated with lots of new information for OS X 10.2 \\"Jaguar,\\" this book (hereafter referred to as MMOSX2 to save my fingers) covers the waterfront for the intermediate and advanced user. While the back cover bills the book as suitable for users of all levels, I think that the raw Macintosh novice would find this book a bit intimidating, with the section Macintosh essentials being swamped by the huge amount of more advanced topics.<br />  Stauffer is exceptionally thorough, with the 804 pages of text covering almost every facet of Mac OS X theory and practice. Rather than recite the various sections from the Table of Contents, you can be assured that almost any question an advanced or power user may have is covered. While not targeted at the hard-core, extreme geek, MMOSX2 does have a good basic introduction to the Unix underpinnings of OS X. Part V Advanced Mac OS X topics spans 100+ pages, and held my attention for page after page.<br />  To my mind, the best sections in MMOSX2 are those on networking and cross-platform operations, as well as the two new chapters on troubleshooting system-level problems and typical OS X problems and solutions. Stauffer provides a well-rounded discussion of these topics, which are not often well served by other general-purpose OS X book, especially the troubleshooting sections.<br />  Unfortunately, MMOSX2 was a bit hard to read, with text just a bit small for my 46 year-old eyes. While a larger type size would have caused the book to balloon to an even greater page count and greater weight, I would have preferred a larger type size. MMOSX2 is not alone, as other \\"boat-anchor\\" books often sacrifice readability for portability. Perhaps the publishers should begin to bundle a pair of cheap bifocals with any book over 500 pages.<br />Mastering Mac OS X Second Edition is clearly a reference book. Stauffer's style is a bit dry, to put it politely, and MMOSX2 will not keep you up into the night, unless you are using it while troubleshooting an OS X problem. But this book is clearly worth buying for its comprehensive collection of OS X information; you'll have all you need in one place on your bookshelf.<br />MacMice Rating: 4.5 out of 5ut it politely, and MMOSX2 will not keep you up into the night, unless you are using it while troubleshooting an OS X problem.

Jennifer Fulton has written over 100 computer books for both the education and retail market. Together they have worked to produce a book that will get you up and going with Photoshop Elements 2 in a relatively short time.<br /> Now the idea is not that you sit down and start to read the book, one chapter an hour straight for twenty-four hours. The idea is to provide the reader with enough information that they can then take an hour or two to work with what they've learned from reading the chapter, building their knowledge and confidence levels as they continue on.<br /> Chapter One starts with the basic introduction to PSE 2 for the reader, explaining the Help resources including Tool Tips, Hints Palette, How-To's and the Help Button. Chapter Two guides the reader through the Elements Desktop, through Tools, Shortcuts, Options, Menus and preferences. Each chapter that follows continues to provide the reader with logical basic information for them to follow as they work their way through the program. Starting and Saving, Importing Source Images, Making Selections and Using Layers, Adding Type, Printing Picture and Posting to the Web cover the remaining 8 hours. The reader then works into Simple Corrections (Levels, Contrast, Color, Straightening, Skewing, Cropping/Resizing, Repair Recipes and Tutorials); Photo Rescue (Black-and-White pictures, Color Repairs, Removing/Replacing Objects, Improvement Filters) and the remaining 7 hours cover Creativity (Artistic Filters, Art from Scratch, Composite Images, Going Wild, Creating Background/Textures from Scratch, to name a few)<br />  Each chapter/hour includes a summary, Q &amp; A, a Workshop (Questions and the Answers) and Activities for the reader to put what they've learned to the test. Ms. Rose has even set up that examples of images used in the book can be downloaded from Sams Publishing's main site to work with as part of the Activities section in two of the chapters.  While the book is in black and white, the authors have included a full Color Gallery that shows the images in the book as they would appear, including the page number and &quot;hour&Oacute; that the reader would be in. The book is logical, well thought out and is not overwhelming even for the brand new user or beneath a user that is familiar with Photoshop Elements.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5used in the book can be downloaded from Sams Publishing's main site to work with as part of the Activities section in two of the chapters.

To that end I downloaded REALbasic and signed up for the e-mail list. I fired up REALbasic every week or so (I suppose I was hoping that programming would suddenly seem easy) and couldn't figure out how to do a damn thing. The net result of my REALbasic interlude was a whole bunch of press release e-mails from Lorin Rivers (REALbasic PR guy). Reflecting on my failure at becoming a programmer (other failed ambitions include: cartoonist, scientist, writer, engineer, director, pro surfer, magician, comedian, and pimp daddy) I wondered \\"is it me or is REALbasic just a little too unintuitive?\\" The answer has been revealed to me thanks to REALbasic for Macintosh.<br />  So was REALbasic beyond my feeble ken or is REALbasic incredibly powerful and surprisingly easy to use? Right now I lean heavily towards the latter, I blame my earlier failings on lack of proper research. Reading REALbasic for Macintosh and working a few examples made me realize that REALbasic is refreshingly easy to use and plenty powerful if you can just get a small foothold. How powerful? Well, every Mac aficionado is aware that periodically Microsoft hems and haws and then slyly hints that they may kill Office for the platform. When the folks at the Mac programming arm of Microsoft hear those rumblings they worry for their jobs. When they're not wondering how long the checks are going to be coming they're using REALbasic to mock up the next version of Office for Mac (Microsoft apparently does all the early work for Office in REALbasic and then programs the final release in something completely different).  All this should illustrate that REALbasic is a fairly powerful programming language that you can use to make even the most complicated pieces of bloatware.<br />  So we've established that REALbasic is plenty powerful, but is it easy to use? A week ago I would have said no, but now I think differently. So how did REALbasic for Macintosh instill such confidence in a complete neophyte like myself? Well Michael Swaine apparently subscribes to the idea that first you teach something very simple but complete and build from there (this was a popular way teaching violin at one time). In this spirit REALbasic for Macintosh starts out showing you how to build an HTML editor. Sure it's simple and useless but if you work through the exercise you begin to see other possibilities. I am a walking example of how successful Michael Swaine's methodology is. I read the Pong example and before I was through I could see how to write Breakout, Super Breakout, Centipede. Q-Bert remains a mystery, but you get the idea of how much you can learn from REALbasic for Macintosh. The examples offer positive feedback and keep the pages of REALbasic for Macintosh turning. While those pages are turning you'll also realize that REALbasic for Macintosh is easily accessible and well thought out, Michael Swaine hasn't written and edge of your seat instruction manual but if you're looking to learn a good deal but don't want to read completely mind numbing textbook type stuff you'll be more than satisfied. In short, between the green and purple covers you'll find everything you need to know to make a super bitchin' REALbasic program, and you'll be surprised how easily the text flows.<br />  I hear the amassed readers crying: But Chris, What about the visual Quickstart part, that uses pictures instead of lengthy explanations? This is the biggest waste of visual quickstarting since \\"Braille: The Visual Quickstart Guide\\" Yep, REALbasic for Macintosh would be just as useful if you took an exacto knife and cut out every single picture (many are simply gratuitous and the rest don't add anything meaningful). I suppose the Visual Quickstart part is tacked on to sell a few more copies but, truthfully, how many books about programming actually need the visual Quickstart part?<br />  Okay, I've ventedand I feel better. Let's review the innate value of the product. REALbasic for Macintosh will set you back twenty-two US dollars. For the twenty two greenbacks you part with you get a top notch instructional manual that will take you as far as you want to go (the back says beginning to intermediate but by the time you're finished with REALbasic for Macintosh you won't need another book you'll need the scary documentation). Compare this to REALbasic prices: The documentation (available via ftp) is a whopping 1,200 hundred pages or you can buy a printed version for fifty bucks. So for twenty-two bucks you can can save a few trees and get all the info you are ever likely to need. I call that a pretty decent value, accountants call it a nice ROI (return on investment) and Enron would subtract the twenty two dollars you spent from the fifty bucks you could have parted with and call it twenty eight dollars of hard earned profit.<br /> Bottom Line: This is a great way to get familiar with REALbasic.<br />MacMice Rating: 3.5 out of 5<br />Chris Seibold<br />[[...]r />          Okay, I've vented and I feel better.

The second edition appeared in 1999, and with the amazing, if not predicted, growth of Unix and expansion into many flavors; it's fitting that a 3rd edition should appear now. Over half of the articles have been revised since that last edition to include information pertaining to many of the smaller but ground-gaining Unix's such as Linux, freeBSD, and Mac OS X's Darwin.<br />  This is a huge book; thus the need for four authors! For a network administrator who understands Unix, and who is contemplating the merging of Mac OS X Server and Client systems into their network, this book should pay for itself in dividends. I was impressed with how thoroughly this book covers the multitude of topics contained within. Everything from mastering the various editors to learning to write shell scripts to detailed instructions for maintaining and backing up a network is included.<br />  I found the book organized logically according to various services. The O'Reilly web site has a complete list of the contents, the index, and user reviews. O'Reilly also has an online fee-based service called MySafari (cool name) which allows subscribers the ability to build virtual bookshelves of O'Reilly books to have at their beck and call whenever they are online. It's free to explore and there's a 14-day demo period as well. You may see a lot for detail of this book by visiting their site.<br />  With more than 50 chapters detailing nearly every nook and cranny of the most common Unix distributions, there's something here for every Unix power user. The updated and expanded sections on security and Windows access are welcome indeed. Every topic is explained with examples and illustrated richly with screen captures. Common problems, mistakes, and real-world examples are distributed liberally throughout the book. If any one book could help a Unix administrator, developer, or power user come to Ôgrep' with the full capabilities of Unix, it would be this book.<br />  Just a few high lights for me included the extensive section on the vi editor, detailing many functions I had no idea existed, such as running scripts within vi as shortcuts for oft-repeated commands. The section on eMacs got me excited about exploring that powerful editor to the extent that I downloaded one of the more extensive distributions for Mac OS X so I could try it out. For a Unix text editor, it is really a good one; however, coming from the Mac background I appreciate BBEdit more and more. Still, every Unix power user will find that some basic knowledge of vi or eMacs will come in very handy when they find themselves with console access and no local text editor other than these.<br />  The closing chapters covering many security issues have captured my attention at this time, as I contemplate moving a few of my domains from a remote dedicated server to one directly under my control running Mac OS X. I think I understand a little better what my host providers have been doing for me all these years!<br />  Make space near your workstation now for this book. If you are a mobile laptop user, like myself, consider becoming a user of MySafari services at O'Reilly, which would allow you to have a book like this available online when it is not convenient to carry the extra weight with you. Bottom line: no serious Unix user and no serious newcomer intending to become proficient in Unix should be without this book!throughout the book.

The book is designed for beginners, Photoshop and Photoshop Elements 2 users, and those who are already familiar with image editing.<br />  What they have produced is a guide that covers PSE 2 from A to Z, for both the PC and Mac user. They start off the book by covering the installation of PSE 2 onto both computer systems, setting up and calibrating monitors and explaining what PSE 2 does best. They cover all aspects as they continue their journey through Elements; from contact sheets, picture packages, plug-ins and scratch disks, palettes, the File Browser, Tools and the Toolbox, Recipes, Selections and Blending.  They deal with Collecting, Cataloging and Managing Images, Correcting Exposures, Contrast and Color Balance, Retouching and Repairing and Filter Effects.<br />  As they take you through Elements, they don't just continue paragraph after paragraph. They do an excellent job of providing the reader with NOTE boxes, bringing up points to be remembered and useful suggestions. TIPS buttons also provide the reader with items to be used during the use of Elements. The graphics that are included cover both Windows and Mac views, along with the commands that are used in both systems. The one thing that needs to be understood is that they have covered every command, tool, recipe, filter and item that is part of Elements 2.<br /> They cover transferring images from your camera, scanning and card/disk readers. They explain File types, such as PSD, TIFF, JPEG and GIF, the four most universal types that are used. They emphasize saving the original file, saving as, proper file formats, strategies and Interpolation. They provide the reader with images and work their way through to the completed task. They show examples of each filter, special effects, text and shapes. I went through the entire book and tried to find something that they may have missed or overlooked within PSE 2... they didn't miss a thing. Need to prepare your images for publication on the Web, have no fear; it's in the book. Dithering, lighting effects, texture fill, tracing, sketching and brushes; it's all there.<br />  The book is a complete reference guide for PSE 2 users. If you want to know about every aspect, tool, filter or use for PSE 2, it's in the book. If you're looking to know everything that there is to know about PSE 2, then run out and get yourself this book. My only complaint about the book was the fact that the color section was very small but the images included in it were so compelling, I wanted more.<br /> All in all, The Complete Reference is an outstanding book for users of PSE 2.

This small book on 802.11b wireless security (167 pages not including the comprehensive index) is not for the faint of heart. To take full advantage of the copious amount of detail that Potter and Fleck provide, you need a good working knowledge of networking, and familiarity with either the Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD operating systems.<br />  802.11 Security is aimed at people who need to configure and administer secure 802.11b wireless (popularly named Airport or WiFi) networks. 802.11 Security is NOT targeted at the casual home computer user who merely wants to keep others from poaching their wireless connection. Those users are best served by Adam Engst's and Glenn Fleishman's Wireless Internet Starter Kit.<br />  However, if you have any interest in comprehensive and detailed knowledge of how 802.11b security works from the network administrator's viewpoint, 802.11 Security is the book for you. Potter and Fleck have years of experience with Unix security issues, and have several papers on the subject to their credit.<br />  After setting the stage with a good discussion of the many problems with wireless security, the authors outline some of the more common types of attacks on wireless networks. Why? Their point is that understanding the nature of the \\"Man-in-the-middle\\" attack (for example) is important for knowing how to prevent it. This point shows that 802.11 Security is more than just a \\"cookbook\\" manual. It provides the \\"why\\" as well as the \\"how.\\"<br />  The bulk of the book covers how to configure FreeBSD, Linux, and OpenBSD clients, gateways, and access points (base stations for us Apple types). Plenty of examples are provided. However, with no CD included to allow copy-and-paste, you'll need to enter everything manually if you want to follow the examples verbatim. In reality, the lack of a CD is not an issue, as the typical sysadmin is going to be working on their customized installation, and will need to tweak the code examples.<br />  802.11 Security does have ten pages on Mac OSX station configuration, as well as a smaller section on Windows setup. For those adventurous readers, the Mac setup section has plenty of examples on how to configure OSX's built-in firewall for best wireless security. The relative paucity on client computer setup is one of the few drawbacks for an end-user reader, as the book focuses on administrator issues.<br />  802.11 Security is a good read for the Unix sysadmin who is new to wireless networks, or for the aficionados who want to roll their own home wireless network security. Again, this is not a mass-market book. But if you're not the average home user, 802.11 Security is a worthwhile book.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />David Weeks<br />[website]the code examples.<br />  802.11 Security does have ten pages on Mac OSX station configuration, as well as a smaller section on Windows setup.

If you've ever watched the Screensavers on Tech TV, you've seen Mikkel Aaland working his magic with Photoshop Elements, so you know that he knows exactly what he's talking about in the book. He has updated his first book, Photoshop Elements 2 Solutions, to provide the reader with the latest information, tips, and step-by-step instructions to make full use of the improvements within PSE 2. If you are into photography, digital photography and image scanning, this book is a must for you.<br />  Written for both PC and Mac user, this full color work first guides the reader through the basics of PSE 2, from setting preferences to where to go for help when using the program. Using his knowledge and skills, Mr. Aaland then walks us through the process that he uses to make ordinary images great ones; from deciding which tasks come first, controls, layer adjustments with masks to resizing and framing your images.<br />  He approaches chapters with the eye of an experienced photographer, as shown in Chapter 3 where he goes into depth on Better Faces, the idea being to intensify the focus on one's eyes, eliminating red eye, getting rid of wrinkles (a must for us baby boomers!)  and using simple techniques and tips to get the reader going in the right direction. You'll find yourself making faces more symmetrical, fixing hair, adding hair and even changing the color and tinting hair. Mr. Aaland even offers tips on producing better portraits and where to find more information on working with photographs.<br /> The book continues with dealing with outside shots, product shots, transparent layers, texture, scale and perspective, even how to set up your own mini photo studio. Want to learn how to do composites, seamless pasting, improve your real estate photographs, balancing light? You'll be walked through the process one step at a time. One whole chapter is devoted to the Photomerge capabilities of PSE 2, including photomerging a collage.<br /> With the photographer in mind, Mr. Aaland shows you how to add a photo credit, use type as headline or fill type with an image. You'll learn how to add additional effects to type, warp it, liquefy it, and even shape it.  Chapter 10 will bring you to the lessons you need to learn to prepare images for the Web, including design components such as navigational graphics, backgrounds and photo galleries. The final two chapters of the book deal with understanding JPEGs, saving and emailing, compression and conversion of GIFs to JPEGs, and using desktop printers and other photography services. The appendix that is included in the book covers Layers, Effects, Selection Tools, Viewing and Navigation Tools, Brushes, Filters and Liquify Filters.<br />  When you also consider the CD that comes with the book, which includes practice images, filters, demos of applications and utilities, and even a demo of a Photoshop Learning Studio, this book is well worth the cost. (Note- the original edition of this book had a CD which caused some problems for users of OS X. Sybex has corrected those problems and the new CD now works properly with OS 9 and X)<br /> You can't go wrong with Mikkel when it comes to working with digital imagery.

The appendix that is included in the book covers Layers, Effects, Selection Tools, Viewing and Navigation Tools, Brushes, Filters and Liquify Filters.<br />  When you also consider the CD that comes with the book, which includes practice images, filters, demos of applications and utilities, and even a demo of a Photoshop Learning Studio, this book is well worth the cost. (Note- the original edition of this book had a CD which caused some problems for users of OS X. Sybex has corrected those problems and the new CD now works properly with OS 9 and X) <br /> You can't go wrong with Mikkel when it comes to working with digital imagery.

You know, or at least you will in just a moment, that you could burn your creation onto a DVD and allow just about anyone with DVD player to view your digital masterstroke. Of course knowing that you can dub your newly birthed nail biter onto a DVD and knowing how to do pull off the trick with panache are two very different propositions. To actually transfer your ninety minute edge of the seat flickering image to the shiny coaster that is a DVD your going to need a few things: a SuperDrive equipped Macintosh, iDVD (packed with every SuperDrive equipped Mac), and (probably) a bunch of blank DVD media. I'd say that's generally equipment enough to get a fairly weak DVD made. On the other hand if you want to make the DVD anything more than the aforementioned homemade ... (you know, give it some style) then you should pay attention to what Bob Levitus has to say in The Little iDVD Book.<br />  iDVD is not an overly complicated program, it's (as are most of the iApps) fairly straightforward. iDVD is basically getting media in, record media onto disk, thanks for using Macintosh. You can do it without an instruction book, which is nice because Apple includes no manual for iDVD. Still, just because a program is fairly easy to use doesn't make the program fairly limited or, trust me, so easy to use you couldn't do with a bit of instruction and a little help. This is where The Little iDVD Book comes in, your most puzzling questions are answered with a quick trip to the index and hints for making a stylish DVD abound. The Little iDVD Book is easy reading and you won't regret the investment of time spent reading The Little iDVD Book or the 19.99 price of admission. Add to that that no matter incredibly lame your iMovie actually is if you follow Bob Levitus' advice it will at least have a very nice wrapper.<br /> The Little iDVD Book is not perfect. The title does contain the word  \\"little\\" and you would think that would entail ripping anything out of The Little iDVD Book not directly pertaining to DVD creation. Alas and alack this is not the case in Bob Levitus' pamphlet about DVD creation. Bob Levitus includes a goodly amount of iMovie tips, a fine idea but again I expect the word \\"little to actually mean something. This actually seems to be a failing of a great number of instructional books since iMovie was introduced, heck you can't pick up a book on COBOL programming without finding an admonition to create a storyboard of your movie before filming somewhere between the covers. The iMovie tips, while solid, are just as out of place in The Little iDVD Book as they are in the fictionalized COBOL book. My other complaint is purely superficial, Bob Levitus seems to love pictures of himself playing the guitar as much as Bruce Springsteen loves singing about cars. Hence every photo is of Bob Levitus in an OS X t-shirt strumming some conglomeration of wood and metal that I bet has a name (probably Rosabelle). I would've appreciated a little more variety in the visuals but this in no way detracts from the quality of the text.<br />  Those small complaints aside The Little iDVD Book achieves that rarest of all feats for the consumer level instructional book: The Little iDVD Book is actually fun to read. Bob Levitus has a light touch and keeps a subtle amount of humor running throughout The Little iDVD Book's 189 pages. While being entertaining is not the bailiwick of most informative tomes (when's the last time you guffawed while perusing the Encyclopedia Britannica?) it adds to the readability of The Little iDVD Book thus ensuring that the reader will likely pick up more useful info from The Little iDVD Book than the large majority of instructional books I've had the pleasure/chore of reading.<br />  Bottom line: If you're going to be using iDVD buy this book....ittle iDVD Book is not perfect.

The Ultimate History of Video Games will tell you.<br />I would rather have seen this book broken up into multiple books. Ten-year increments to the story would have been nice, which would have given the author more time and space to really delve more into each company and game along the way.

Perhaps your questions are even more fundamental: Is this the camera for me? If it's not can I exchange this camera for a cheaper one and keep the difference? Just where does the film go anyway? Cynthia Baron wants to answer your questions and she wants to make a little dough in the process. To achieve this laudable goal she and Daniel Beck have written The Little Digital Camera Book. The Little Digital Camera Book is a good read for anyone who just bought a digital camera and a great book for anyone who is getting ready to buy a digital camera. The Little Digital Camera Book is not as well suited for the intermediate user or for the budding Ansel Adams who understands the technical aspects and aspires to take better pictures.<br />The Little Digital Camera Book opens with a very brief history of photography followed by a few steps to prepare your computer for the imminent image exchanges. If you have more than a passing familiarity with RAM and why you need it skip to Chapter 2 that's when the book first becomes useful. Chapter 2 of The Little Digital Camera Book is a potentially big money saver if you're one of those bigger numbers must be better type of person. If you read carefully you'll realize you don't need that 5-megapixel-money pit, a 2 megapixel will likely suit your needs. The rest of the chapter is fairly useful as well, though you are not going to end up saving a couple of hundred bucks by continuing to follow Cynthia L. Baron's advice. If you just can't bring yourself to part with the ... cover price of The Little Digital Camera Book at least stand and read chapter 2 in your local bookstore; the advice therein is well worth following.<br />The rest of the book is not as immediately useful to the novice user but the majority of The Little Digital Camera Book will be useful to the average digital camera owner at some point. You get your basic photo composition tips (rule of thirds et al), your basic image editing tips (though these a bit too general to truly be useful), some info on storage options and just enough info on online versus local printing options. All of the information is pertinent and all of it is well presented. The information you find most useful will undoubtedly not be the info I find most germane but there's something in The Little Digital Camera Book for everyone.<br />I do have a few gripes about The Little Digital Camera Book. The same camera is used as the model throughout the book. This is fine if you own an Olympus but if you use any other brand of camera you might feel a bit cold-shouldered. Since The Little Digital Camera Book is (presumably) a book aimed at just about any novice user it might have been more interesting if a variety of cameras were used for demonstration purposes. My last gripe regards color photographs. Photography books have to address color and color correction owing to the nature of the subject but a precious few actually go to the extra expense of providing color plates to illustrate the point being made. I regard this exclusion as a necessary omission but a few color plates could have put The Little Digital Camera Book at the top of my must have list.<br />Bottom Line: The Little Digital Camera Book manages to cut a wide swath without being over simplistic or overly detailed. The Little Digital Camera is a nice book for beginners, pros should look elsewhere.<br />MacMice Rating: 3.5 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chris Seiboldr basic photo composition tips (rule of thirds et al), your basic image editing tips (though these a bit too general to truly be useful), some info on storage options and just enough info on online versus local printing options.

Wireless networking goes by several monikers; Apple calls it AirPort, many PC manufacturers call it Wi-Fi, and techies refer to its official name of 802.11b. Most business oriented hotels, and airport frequent-flyer lounges now provide Wi-Fi access, and boutique coffee shops are adding wireless networking to attract and keep customers.<br />If you want to share your Internet access at home between several computers, be they Macs or Windows machines, wireless networking is becoming more and more affordable. But there is often more to this technology than meets the eye. I have a Mac; do I have to buy Apple-branded equipment? What access point (the Base Station, in Apple-speak) do you buy? What wireless card do you buy? What about security?<br />Shelley Brisbin's Build Your Own Wi-Fi Network is aimed at end users wanting to learn more than just the basics of how to get your Wi-Fi up and running. Brisbin's extensive experience authoring computer books and articles (nine books and many articles) helps her to thoroughly cover the subject.<br />Will this book be useful to the average Macintosh owner who wants to go wireless, be it with Apple's AirPort equipment, or third-party hardware? At first glance, the distinctly Windows orientation of the book appeared to make it less-than-useful to Mac users. But Brisbin is careful to be fairly platform agnostic; each section includes Mac information. Since many wireless routers are configured via a web browser, the screen shots are perfectly useful to Mac users. Ironically, Apple's own AirPort Base Station is one of the few wireless access points not configured via a web browser!<br />If all you want is a quick and dirty overview of wireless networking, Build Your Own Wi-Fi Network may be a bit much. But if you want a basic grasp of the fundamentals of how 802.11b works, without being overwhelmed with too much information, Brisbin provides it. She is able to walk that fine line between too much and not enough detail. All aspects of wireless are covered, including sections on antennas, multiple access points, wireless-to-wired networking issues, and many more.<br />Build Your Own Wi-Fi Network covers what to look for in both access points, and wireless cards. Several brands are discussed. This kind of information is platform agnostic, so don't let the Windows screenshots and references dissuade you.<br />Brisbin devotes plenty of time to discuss wireless networking security in detail. Many wireless users are not aware of how exposed their networks can be. Even if they do, they don't know how to decide how much security to implement. The chapters on security are very valuable, and every purchaser of this book should read this section carefully. You may be more exposed than you think! Again, the information Brisbin provides is fully applicable to Macintosh users.<br />If you want a thorough grounding in wireless networking fundamentals, this book should be high on your list.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />David Weeksn, Brisbin provides it.

It is full of real world \\"how to\\" information on how to understand, design, configure, troubleshoot, and use, a wireless network.<br />Engst penned the enormously successful Internet Starter Kit, and publishes the very popular TidBITS newsletter. Glenn Fleishman has co-written Real World Adobe GoLive, and has written for the New York Times. Their respective resumes set high expectations, and The Wireless Networking Starter Kit meets them all.<br />While hard-core Macintosh users may feel slighted that the book's subtitle leads off with Windows, Engst and Fleishmann gives Macintoshes their full attention in each chapter. This book, like all good Wi-Fi/802.11b networking books, is fully platform-agnostic.<br />One thing that distinguishes the Wireless Networking Starter Kit (WNSK) from some other Wi-Fi books is that the authors spend a fair number of pages early on discussing the basics of networking, both wired and wireless. This is a good tactic, as many readers are using the ease of Wi-Fi/Airport to make their first forays into what can be an esoteric and confusing networking world. Having a grounding in the basics will ease the potential frustration that comes from not really understanding how networking works when you first plunge into the deep end of the 802.11b swimming pool.<br />Chapter 3, How Wireless Works, is less detailed than other books but enough detail is provided for the reader to understand the essential concepts. I found the best tidbit to be that airborne water particles can absorb or deflect radio waves in the 802.11b frequency band, something I had not read in more technical discussions.<br />Chapter 4, Connecting Your Computer, leads the reader through the \\"how do I set up my network settings\\" morass. Plenty of screenshots are used to show how OS 9 and OS X Macs, and Win 98/XP machines are configured. I've found that the help provided by this type of graphic hand-holding is the key for most people, as some understand the hardware concepts of networking, but cannot wade through the computer jargon to know what number goes in what dialog box! When you get through the relevant part of this chapter, your computer should be ready to go.<br />I found it refreshing that the authors heavily emphasize planning before doing when a wireless network is first installed. For me, a long-time advocate of the \\"just start plugging stuff in\\" approach to network design, this is a novel concept. If I had taken the time to follow Engst's and Fleishmann's advice, my own early forays into networking would have been much easier. Included in this chapter on network building is a good overview of various hardware devices such as print spoolers, switches vs. routers, and bridges.<br />For me, the best two chapters in WNSK are the discussions of wireless security, and how to actually use wireless networking in the big, wide real world of airports, coffee houses, and offices. The security chapter pulls no punches about the pros and (mostly) cons of the wireless WEP security protocol, but the authors don't foment panic by discussing what level of security is appropriate for what kind of user. Various techniques such as SSL, VPN, SSH, are covered in enough detail to show the user that reasonable wireless security can be obtained with a modicum of effort.<br />Taking It on the Road was a great read. I found the chapter to be a great resource listing both for-fee commercial networks, as well free networks. Hints on how to connect to many different providers are included, as well as how to resolve possible connection problems.<br />The section on long-distance wireless was interesting, but I do wonder how many novice to intermediate uses will use WNSK to build their own special antennas and establish long-distance wireless networks. More generally useful was the section on troubleshooting wireless networking problems.<br />The Wireless Networking Starter Kit is the best book so far for the average reader on Wi-Fi/AirPort/802.11b networking. If you want to cut the (Ethernet) cord, start by reading this book!<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />David Weeks ...ally useful was the section on troubleshooting wireless networking problems.<br />The Wireless Networking Starter Kit is the best book so far for the average reader on Wi-Fi/AirPort/802.11b networking.

Turns out the weakest spot of any network (computer or otherwise) are the human elements. Solution: kill everyone with access to your computer system. Just kidding. The solution, predictably, is training and awareness. Those are the conclusions of The Art of Deception and I suppose more training and heightened awareness of system security is solid advice but only a few folks are going to read The Art of Deception for the insights into system security. The majority of readers are going to pick up The Art of Deception to read the delicious subterfuges and insights into human credulity (a very few may pick it up to hone their own scamming techniques).<br />If you want to learn a bit about hacking and/or conning people (called social engineering by Kevin Mitnick) or just read stories about the aforementioned topic Kevin Mitnick is the guy with the best stories. For the uninformed reader Kevin Mitnick is probably the most notorious hacker in US history. He's served jail time, company's claim he cost them millions of dollars and the government tracked him for years before capturing the super cyber fugitive. Of course some argue that Kevin Mitnick really didn't do too much wrong and even if he did it was more out of curiosity than malice. I haven't researched the topic enough to form a definitive opinion but I have seen and read enough to know that Kevin Mitnick is hacker supreme. Once you read The Art of Deception you won't doubt Kevin Mitnick's abilities and you'll see why he was able to get away with so much for so long. All this adds up to making Kevin Mitnick probably the single most authoritative person to write this kind of book.<br />First off let me say the scams that Kevin Mitnick references actually work, I know cause I tried one. I picked a company I knew a little about called the receptionist and asked for her user name and password. She told me her password and user name, no questions asked. I was startled by how easy the process was but I attempted no further hacking (not because I was scared or suddenly moral but because the company makes extremely boring stuff). Calling up and asking someone for a password is the simplest ruse of all and probably the most often used con. The trick, naturally, is to make the person on the other end of the phone think that you're entitled to the information somehow, and that's where the real \\"social engineering\\" starts. While the crux of any scam may be the same the road getting to that point can be very interesting. In The Art of Deception there are some scams so complicated they would make David Mamet salivate and these are the scams that are particularly enthralling to read even though the occasionally stretch the limits of plausibility. Regardless of the believability of the retold ruses they all have a common theme: they are very enjoyable short tales of human fallibility.<br />The cons and seductions are enough to carry The Art of Deception; less entertaining are the solutions to prevent said miracles of flimflam. Of course the prevention of the scheme is always less exciting than the actual scam so it's no surprise when you find yourself skimming the \\"what Bob could've done\\" sections. There are a few scams that may be directly useful to the average Joe (which one of these says PAYPAL: paypal or paypa1?) but most of the beguilements solutions will be of interest to IT directors and tech support folks. In fact I can reveal the solutions to the scams: know whom you're talking to and don't give out your password. That advice, while predictable, doesn't carry as much weight as it does when coupled with the scams and schemes presented in The Art of Deception. If you're one of the folks who think that you could never get suckered Kevin Mitnick will make you a believer.<br />Who is this book really for? Well if you're an IT director the book will be very useful. If you're a company that deals with very sensitive information you may want to make The Art of Deception required reading for anyone with a password.

US	39916916	R2I09WEJZEIJBX	0735700443	487206432	002: Digital Character Animation 2, Volume II: Advanced Techniques	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Tad Scheeler MyMac.com Book Review	With Digital Character Animation 2, volume 2: advanced techniques, the maestro of animation, George Maestri picks up where he left off in volume 1 and delivers an amazing amount of knowledge in 218 easy to read, well illustrated, full color pages. Every page is short, sweet, to the point, and packed with tips that any aspiring digital animator needs to know. It is full of essential information that will help the reader turn out effective, believable animation.<br />Digital Character Animation 2, volume 2: advanced techniques is written from a software-neutral perspective and focuses on fundamental concepts that can be applied in any program. It begins with chapters on real world production and story development from an animator's point of view. The heart of the book contains chapters on rigging characters, tips and tricks, human and animal motion, acting, and anthropomorphic animation (animating the inanimate). It ends with a chapter on animation for games.<br />George Maestri's credentials are impressive. He has worked on projects for Nickelodeon (Rocko's Modern Life), CBS (The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat) and was the original animation producer of South Park.<br />Whether you are a student of animation, a hobbyist or a professional, this book should be in your library right next to Digital Character Animation 2, volume 1: essential techniques. I consider both volumes required reading for any person interested in character animation. My copies are already dog-eared from constant use.<br />The only negative comments I will make are the lack of an accompanying CD to augment the text and the relatively high price tag for the book. At $50 (US), I would expect a CD, especially with a book on animation. Volume 1 of this series did come with a CD and I found it very helpful in understanding the concepts presented in the text.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Tad Scheeler	2002-12-11

What works best here are specific screen shots in vibrant colors giving clear, concise, detailed instructions for beginning users of Photoshop 7.<br />This cross-platform book provides specific directions for OS 9, OS X, and Windows whenever necessary. Bravo! It's a multi-OS world out there, publishers and authors. Two-page lesson spreads make valuable use of the highly successful \\"Teach Yourself Visually\\" format. Helpful Q&A style tips enhance each lesson.<br />Turning to pages 82-83, we learn how to \\"skew or distort a selection\\" in Photoshop, complete with numbered, bulleted steps. It would take hundreds of words to instruct without comparable impact of the four-panel illustration. Just one example among many from Wooldridge and maranGraphics.<br />Any gripes? Yes:<br />* Often items within a screen being targeted visually are too tiny to see clearly if you're not following along while running Photoshop on your computer.<br />* I'm being picky, but I get tired of seeing the same JPG examples used over and over again: bagels, palm trees, and light bulbs, for example. I understand they are repeated for continuity, but a little more variety would add spice to the imagery. (I do like that lime-green bagel multiple-effects layer project on pages 192-193, though.)<br />* Teach Yourself Visually Adobe Photoshop 7 is a teaser, making me want to try everything in P7, but then I'll need to dig deeper within a more extensive book. Some beginners will outgrow the book before they finish using its tutorials.<br />This book is most suited for readers who learn best from a visual presentation, then work on their own to develop more skills. Teach Yourself Visually Adobe Photoshop 7 makes just about everything in the software seem approachable.<br />WOULD I BUY IT? Yes, to help students who fit the above profile.<br />WOULD I USE IT IF IT WAS THE ONLY PHOTOSHOP BOOK AVAILABLE: Yes, and then set it aside in favor of PhotoShop's built-in Help application for additional instruction.<br />DO I RECOMMEND IT?

Deke McClelland sets the standard for Photoshop authors, and MyMac.com plans to cover every item he publishes on the topic. What makes this Dummies entry into the Photoshop 7 arena worth raving about?<br />Two pages (four sides) of card stock are the first items you encounter when opening Photoshop 7 for Dummies. These quick reference \\"cheat sheets\\" present separate Windows and Macintosh keyboard commands for toolbars, selections, layers, palettes, and more. Worth a hefty portion of the price of this book, all on their own.<br />These authors write with a zippy, witty style that makes learning and using Photoshop fun (almost) and enjoyable (always). Did you know about \\"Dr. Photo and Mr. Shop\\"? If not, you need to begin with Chapter One and turn off the phone until you understand the difference.<br />Both Windows and Mac (OS X) screen shots are plentiful, making this book truly cross platform. Illustrations are bold and easy on the eyeballs, and tutorial steps are printed in bold type. Why don't other publishers realize how important printing and inking are to readers learning difficult material from scratch?<br />You want tips? How about warnings? Photoshop 7 for Dummies has them in profusion, on page after page. Special mention is given to each feature new to Photoshop 7, for all you upgraders. The brief color section has some mind-expanding examples of projects enumerated within the text.<br />I'm having a difficult time maintaining focus on this review, friends, because I'm itching to use the book to help me learn tons more about Photoshop 7.

Photoshop is so vast and complex that breaking down its introductory features into small component exercises is a perfect solution for newcomers.<br />Many worthwhile aspects in this book:<br />* each of the 24 assignments is complete within itself, and comes in handy sooner or later during future (or sometimes previous) chapters<br />* all screen shots are taken from OS X's version of Photoshop 7<br />* a special URL can be reached via the Sams main web site, containing every image used in the text, downloaded either one unit at a time or all together as a 13MB file<br />* Carla Rose's conversational writing style is friendly and inviting, with occasional humor, taking the edge away from PhotoShop's tendency to intimidate inexperienced users<br />* individual lessons and tutorials are concise, and numbered sequentially for easy following along<br />Any complaints? Yes, one: the color photo insert is bright and bold, but the many helpful grayscale images are feeble in comparison; higher grade inking would help.<br />Each of the 24 \\"hours\\" in Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Photoshop in 24 Hours ends with a useful Q & A, plus a quiz (with answers) and some exercises targeted to the material in the unit. Readers who make the effort to study and work through each chapter will be intermediate Photoshoppers before long. Subject topics begin with the absolute basics and finish with substantial techniques presented.<br />This book is easy to understand, friends, and well worth a rating of MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5 for people new to Photoshop.<br />WOULD I BUY IT?

Palette and toolbar screen shots are large, clear grayscale images with itemized arrows for detailed explanations. The screen shots are all Windows-only, but Macintosh keyboard commands are given when necessary.<br />How To Do Everything with Photoshop 7 is particularly strong on basics and fundamentals, and light on project usage of them. The book's structure and concept incorporate primarily an outline-and-discussion method of presentation, with everything referenced to related chapter content elsewhere in the text.<br />A thorough, patient approach to under-the-hood tedium in Photoshop pervades the writing style, including Chapter Three: \\"Setting Your Preferences.\\" The grayscale comparative examples, such as different filter effects on page 194, don't have much impact, but they are better than none whatsoever.<br />This publisher's promise of the How to Do Everything series is to get novices started without too much intimidating technical detail and jargon.

I can also tell you that the first lobotomy was performed on November 12th, 1935. How could I possibly know such vital minutiae? My secret is \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" a book where you can find such mind bogglingly cool trivia every day of the year. Leo Laporte also mentions that lobotomies aren't performed anymore and generally considered inhumane. I find that statement highly suspect. After all, someone green lighted not one but three (!) Yahoo Serious movies in twelve years.<br />I bet when you heard the word \\"almanac\\" the first thing you think of is \\"The Farmers Almanac\\". Sure you've probably never actually seen one (I haven't) but you know (as do I) that it is full of highly questionable information such as predicting the length of winter by squishing a wooly worm and measuring the ensuing bug goo displacement. This prejudice does a disservice to worthwhile almanacs everywhere. \\"Technology Almanac\\" is classic bathroom reading, informative and brief articles (one per calendar day of 2003 day) with plenty of humor thrown in for gentertainment value. It is definitely not Mac exclusive but there is no anti Mac bias either. \\"Technology Almanac\\" is just a solid effort with plenty-o-coverage for any computer that a home user is likely to have. But there's more than just tech stuff, there's also loads of the aforementioned useless trivia and a pointless daily poll. . Generally I'd deduct points for the poll (I hate unscientific polls) but since Leo's poll is usually some amusing question I am going to make like the third prong of an electrical plug and remain neutral.<br />If you're wondering just what kind of tech info you'll find scattered throughout this epic length almanac (it's a page a day but \\"Technology Almanac\\" has a whole slew of appendixes that stretch the length to 530 pages) you've come to the right place. On any given page you'll find a tip of the day, a download of the day and probably some nifty links. Sure you won't find every article super useful or every link a must visit but you'll find enough winners sprinkled throughout \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" to make the reading well worth the minimal daily investment of time. Heck part of the fun is turning the page and stumbling onto something useful that you never knew about before.<br />Some books seem written precisely for some people and this was the case with \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\". Leo Laporte clearly wrote this book just for me, at least that's the inevitable conclusion if one judges the book's value by how many pages I have dog eared. I know, I cheated and read the book all at once instead of day by day, call it reviewer's license, but I enjoyed every guilty second.<br />I can confidently say this will be a great Christmas/Hanukkah/Qwaanza/Festivus present for any computer user on your holiday list that leans slightly to the geeky side. Of course if you're really smart you'll run out and buy the book now and read \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" (be careful, avoid signs of wear) before the holidays roll around then give said book to a dear friend. Using my method you get to read the all the coolness that is \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\" and you save $24.99 on a gift for that dear friend or relative.<br />Bottom line: If you like trivia and computer tips, some worthless and some worthwhile, or know someone who does you won't go wrong with \\"TechTV Leo Laporte's 2003 Technology Almanac\\". As it is I can tell that this book is not as great as I think it is but it is still pretty good.

Not sure what to do next or how to get started?<br />Well, with Maria Langer's newest book, (book number 50, by the way!) Mac OS X (10.2), you'll be up and running in no time at all. The nice thing about the Visual QuickStart series is that they provide you with enough visual aids and the right amount of well-written text to get you started in whatever topic the book is covering.<br />Ms. Langer starts at the beginning by explaining OS X, and then gives a quick run-through on 10.1 and 10.2. She then works you through installing OS X (10.2) on your computer, setting up the basic configuration options, including your Internet connections and then drops you back into installing OS 9.2.x on your computer. For previous Mac OS users, it's old stuff, but for the new users out there, it's just what they need.<br />She then runs you through the basics of the Mac Finder, File Management, basic and advanced techniques of the Finder and applications, and then you journey into the realm of TextEdit. Ms. Langer then walks you through Printing, Internet Connections, using Sherlock and then into the use of the i-Apps; iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie and iDVD. She does not take you into the realm of iSync or iCal, apparently she just didn't have the time to get involved with them prior to the book being printed. The remainder of the book deals with AppleScript basics, Help basics and the other things that would bring a new OS X user up to speed. She does take the time to cover the .Mac information at the end of the book for those that will take the time to use Apple's latest incarnation of its online service.<br />Mac OS X (10.2) is not a lengthy book; it's not 3 or 4 inches thick. It is not a thesis on OS X.2 nor does it cover X in really great detail. It's only 354 pages long and designed to get the reader up and running on OS X.2 in the shortest amount of time. The text and the pictures are the best way to get someone up and running quickly and Ms. Langer has it down pat. She provides the reader with the right amount of text, tips and pictures and she keeps you going. The book is easy to read and a valuable guide. So if you're in the market to get up to speed on OS X.2, avail yourself of Maria Langer's book.

Book Review	So, you have flexed your credit card, and purchased (or upgraded to) Microsoft Office v. X for Macintosh. After all, it is the Mac equivalent of the biggest, baddest, most popular office productivity suite in the PC world. You come home from your dealer, or get the package from the delivery truck driver, and rip the box open, only to find a CD-ROM disk and packing slip.<br />That's all.<br />\\"There's gotta be more,\\" you say, as you rummage around in the suspiciously slim box. Unfortunately, the User Guides that you look for are nowhere to be found. You install the software, and try out the various parts: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage. The on-line Help file answers a few of your questions, but it does nothing to answer the bigger question: \\"How do I USE this thing?\\"<br />Welcome to the Death of Documentation. This phrase, coined by TidBITS publisher Adam Engst, reflects the fact that comprehensive user guides, even for many complex software suites, have become a thing of the past. Paper has been replaced with on-line help. Read the article to get a better feel for the pros and cons of the trend to on-line help.<br />The yawning gap left by software publishers' failure to provide paper documentation has been well-filled by many book publishers. Buyers spend big bucks to buy software, and then they can't learn how to use it, so they run to buy a book. Tom Negrino, Kirk McElhearn and Kate Binder have the book for you.<br />Microsoft Office: mac v. X Inside Out is my current recommendation in the Macintosh Office v. X help book category. Covering Word, Entourage, Excel, and PowerPoint, its 975 pages keep it from the \\"boat-anchor\\" category (just barely), so you can actually read this from an easy chair. The book is targeted at the Intermediate/Advanced level user, not at the raw Macintosh beginner; it won't tell the newbie how to run a Macintosh. But, if you put this book to good use, you'll have a solid grounding in Office v. X.<br />A word to the wise: don't feel that you have to read Microsoft Office: mac v. X Inside Out (hereafter referred to as MOIO) from cover to cover, as I did. Users who are upgrading from earlier Office versions will best employ MOIO as a reference book. The excellent index and table of contents make finding particular topics easy, and the material is presented in such a way that small subject areas stand on their own.<br />My one kvetch with the Word material came from the my reading it from cover to cover, as opposed to using it as a reference to find specific information. I felt the section on Word never really presented the user with the best overall strategy to create a document. Chapter 2 Creating and Managing Documents covers the essentials, but I felt that someone new to Office v. X could use a broader discussion of the ins-and-outs of documents, sections, chapters, master documents, etc, earlier in the book, rather than later.<br />My experience with the other Office components is minimal, compared to my expertise in Word. Reading the Excel section gave me a great overview of all the powerful features that I never knew how to use. The advanced user will find plenty of detail in MOIO on AppleScripting spreadsheets, and a solid foundation of PivotTable information. The Solver is discussed, but not in great detail.<br />As I knew virtually nothing about Entourage and Powerpoint before reviewing MOIO, I was glad that I came away with the feeling that I could use the applications after one reading of the book. I might even have to abandon my current calendaring application in favor of Entourage. If I ever get a corporate job, MOIO will help me attain true PowerPoint-jockey status.<br />While the Office v. X book field is not yet jammed with entries, Negrino, McElhearn, and Binder's Microsoft Office: mac v. X Inside Out will be stiff competition for any new competition.

The excellent index and table of contents make finding particular topics easy, and the material is presented in such a way that small subject areas stand on their own.<br />My one kvetch with the Word material came from the my reading it from cover to cover, as opposed to using it as a reference to find specific information. I felt the section on Word never really presented the user with the best overall strategy to create a document. Chapter 2 Creating and Managing Documents covers the essentials, but I felt that someone new to Office v. X could use a broader discussion of the ins-and-outs of documents, sections, chapters, master documents, etc, earlier in the book, rather than later.<br />My experience with the other Office components is minimal, compared to my expertise in Word. Reading the Excel section gave me a great overview of all the powerful features that I never knew how to use. The advanced user will find plenty of detail in MOIO on AppleScripting spreadsheets, and a solid foundation of PivotTable information. The Solver is discussed, but not in great detail.<br />As I knew virtually nothing about Entourage and Powerpoint before reviewing MOIO, I was glad that I came away with the feeling that I could use the applications after one reading of the book. I might even have to abandon my current calendaring application in favor of Entourage. If I ever get a corporate job, MOIO will help me attain true PowerPoint-jockey status.<br />While the Office v. X book field is not yet jammed with entries, Negrino, McElhearn, and Binder's Microsoft Office: mac v. X Inside Out will be stiff competition for any new competition. I strongly recommend it for both new Office users, and for upgraders.<br />MacMice Rating: 4.5 out of 5...	2002-11-21

In spite of the \\"PHD,\\" or \\"push here, dummy\\" tendency of most point-and-shoot digital photographers, a good third-party book always helps with understanding what's what with your equipment and photographic results.<br />Each of the primary topics is explored with a series of detailed questions, followed by numbered steps accompanied by screenshots and illustrations. Digital Photography: 99 easy tips has a center section containing completed examples in color, effective itemized descriptive text, and not-very-good-quality black and white photos that go along with valuable techniques and tips.<br />Tutorials are brief and specific, and encourage readers to practice the lessons on their own with necessary repetition. Photography is so effortless, most of us never understand that to excel at it requires practice and more practice.<br />This book has a decent intro to digital cameras and storage media, with good content on basic photography. I had just read a digital camera manual before picking up Digital Photography: 99 easy tips, and the book really helped me make sense of the gobbledygook in the official manual. You will be a better photographer from working with all the material in this very affordable book.<br />MacMice Rating: 3 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />John Nemerovski	2002-11-05

Scott Kelby that is, author maniac who seems to have a new book published every other month over there at New Rider Publishing. I mean, a Photoshop 7 Killer Tips book, The Naked Truth book, Photo-Retouching book, a Down and Dirty Tricks Photoshop book, and now a Mac OS X Killer Tips book. (I just noticed something. Dirty, Secret, Naked...is Scott Kelby writing for Penthouse on the side as well?)<br />I think there is something strange going on here. No one can write this many books! I think he has some sort of Evil Word Marco thingie running, churning out these books for him. He simply feeds in the type of book he wants to publish, and the Evil Word Macro does the rest. Screen grabs, paragraphs, you name it. Takes about a week and a half. He then goes through and makes some very minor adjustments, adds a few jokes (an Evil Word Macro has no sense of humor, as we all know) and calls it good.<br />But here's the thing. Each and every one of his books are really, really good. The Naked Truth was fantastic. His Down and Dirty Photoshop 7 book is a must have for users of that program. And his latest, the focus of this review, is Mac OS X Killer Tips, seems to be on par or above all his others.<br />Laden with humor and (for the most part) worthwhile tips, Mac OS X Killer Tips is a great addition to any Mac OS X users library of titles. This edition covers OS X 10.2 (Jaguar for those in the know) very well. It includes a screen capture image of what Scott is describing in almost every instance.<br />The book is full color, with razor-sharp imagery. Coming in at 267 pages, it may seem a small book, but it is packed with enough relevant information to satisfy almost anyone using Apple's latest operating system.<br />I very much enjoyed reading this book. I liked the layout a great deal, as well as the words on the page. Scott Kelby is quickly becoming an author in whom I find the need to get his latest book, a position for a computer and technology writer reserved only for David Pogue on my desk up to now. Scott writes with a sense of humor I find very appealing, as well as a great technical grasp of his subject material. He really seems to put a lot of himself in the books he writers, and makes no apologies for being a die-hard Mac head.<br />Mac OS X Killer Tips is thirteen chapters long. It covers everything from iDVD tips to troubleshooting. From Stickies tricks to annoying pranks you can play on another Mac user. (If you can get your hands on their computer while they are away.) Sherlock 3 is covered here, as is Mail, all the \\"i\\" applications, Address Book, and much more. I found the Finder tips to be the most fun, though, and took quite a few ideas away from this book that I have instituted in my own daily computer life. (No small feat there, as I am a Power User to the bone.)<br />A really, really good read. Well worth the asking price. You will find yourself going back to it often to learn or refresh yourself on some of the tips you will learn in its pages.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Tim Robertsoneem a small book, but it is packed with enough relevant information to satisfy almost anyone using Apple's latest operating system. <br />I very much enjoyed reading this book.

It's not arguable that pictures AND a thousand words are the most effective means to communicate the features and methods of any particular software application, especially an application like Adobe's GoLive 6 which excels at filling your screen real estate with windows and palettes.<br />The Visual QuickStart Guides from Peachpit Press are the perfect blend of text and illustrations, and Adobe GoLive 6 for Macintosh & Windows, Visual QuickStart Guide, is no exception. Shelly Brisbin, an accomplished writer, speaker, and consultant in the Mac and Internet working world for 15 years, does and outstanding job with this book, her ninth, creating a virtual reference work for any serious web designer using GoLive.<br />The book's cover exclaims, \\"Teach yourself GoLive the quick and easy way! This Visual QuickStart Guide uses pictures rather than lengthy explanations. You'll be up and running in no time!\\" Honestly, I cannot vouch for that claim, since I've been using GoLive since it was GoLive Pro in 1997, before it became GoLive Cyberstudio Pro and was then subsequently purchased from GoLive, Inc. by Adobe as it attained the venerable version 3 status. But I would hazard a guess that if you are familiar with basic web design and HTML editing, you could spend an hour going through the first few chapters with Adobe GoLive 6 running on your computer and you would have the basic feel of the program.<br />If you are fairly new to WYSIWYG web page editors, then you should proceed through chapters three through eight to gain the basic knowledge of all the key features and tools that comprise the GoLive arsenal. For the more advanced user, chapters nine through fourteen explain the advanced page building tools, including the handling of cascading style sheets, one of GoLive's strengths, and multimedia, another strong point that makes Adobe GoLive one of the top choices among professionals. The remaining chapters cover what I consider to be the piece d'resistance of GoLive: it's site management capabilities, including the new site server, and advanced QuickTime and animation support. The only thing I didn't find in this book was an appendix with such useful information as a chart of short cut keys, but then Adobe sends this with the application. Still, it would be nice to have in the event a user has lost theirs.<br />This book is designed primarily for beginning to intermediate users of Adobe GoLive 6 and is not intended to provide an encyclopedic reference for every facet of the program. But if you, like me, tend to skim over the software manuals, lack the photographic memory requisite for remembering every menu command and configuration option, or just need to get up and running quickly with GoLive, you will benefit by this book. Glancing at my bookshelf with six different GoLive specific texts, this one seems to always end up on top, indicating it's the one I most often refer to.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Jeffrey McPheeters<br />[...]hapters cover what I consider to be the piece d'resistance of GoLive: it's site management capabilities, including the new site server, and advanced QuickTime and animation support.

Bert Monroy does some really amazing things in Photoshop (and Illustrator), and guides you step by step on how he did it. From creating window blinds to creating handles on a photo-realistic filling cabinet, this book is filled with great pictures and easy to read language many Photoshop users will find useful.<br />(I should mention, though, that while you can create the great looking scenes Bert did in Photoshop, why would you want to? I mean, with 3D software so low in price today, you can get even more realistic graphics with a program such as Strata than you can with Photoshop. In MUCH less time. But Bert Monroy is an artist, and Photoshop is his tool, so this is more a practical thought on my end, and has no bearing on the quality of this book or the techniques applied therein.)<br />The book itself is well written, though I particularly enjoyed the beginning of the book in which the reader gets a glimpse of Bert÷s studio. I would die for a studio like that, let me tell you!<br />Photoshop Studio is as much a picture book, as it is a written one. On almost every page is a picture of what he is writing about, how to do it, and all in clear color. (And the screen snapshots all show Bert is using Mac OS X!)<br />Photoshop Studio is a class act. Well put together, well-written, and easy to follow. I enjoyed the time I spent with this book, and if you are into Photoshop, you will too.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5...	2002-10-24

The DVD itself is not so much bonus material for the book, as most discs that come with books are, but a full-fledged partner of content.<br />Picture this: A great book that goes into a good amount of detail on iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD to get even the most technophobe newbie up and running, but a DVD partner in which you can actually watch and learn how to do it yourself.<br />A part of me wanted to write this review and keep the book and DVD separate, focusing on the merits and shortcomings of each alone. But that really cannot be done, as the two are wed in a content marriage of blissful splendor. (By the way, I don't think I have ever use either blissful or splendor in any review or article I have ever written, let along in the same sentence.!)<br />You can watch the DVD or read the book on its own, but using these two together is where the strength of The Macintosh Digital Hub comes out. They are both excellent examples of a writer not just chasing a paycheck, but one who really wants his or her readership to understand and enjoy the subject matter.<br />The book is well written, in slightly larger text than other books of its kind. A welcome change for older eyes. The book is full of color screen shots, diagrams, and other colorful items to help get the point of topic across in the easiest and most straightforward way. In fact, almost every page in The Macintosh Digital Hub has a color picture on it.<br />P>The DVD is also broken up into four main chapters, the same as the book, and you can navigate directly via the menu to the segment within the chapter you want to watch. This is a nice DVD, easy to watch and learn by.<br />One of the problems I have had recently with books is the price. I totally agree that the content creators should be well compensated for their hard work. But the cost of some of the recent Photoshop book, for instance, is outrageous. How many books can us users afford (especially in this economy)  Not very many, I think. But here again, The Macintosh Digital Hub shows not only great content, but also a price point to match. &lt;A companion DVD that is not just sample files and software demos. All content, all the time, at half the price you would expect to pay.

In fact, his book tells you how to live the digital lifestyle \\"a la vida loca.\\"<br />There are plenty of good books focusing on iMovie, iPhoto, iTunes, and iDVD (the so-called \\"iApps.\\") Nevertheless, this is the first book to focus on the integration between the iApps. Miser does not tell you just how to use iMovie, iTunes, and iPhoto; he tells you how to use them all together to create a seamless digital production. This focus on integration, and using the strong points of each application is what sets Mac OS X and the Digital Lifestyle apart from books that simply tell you how to use one iApp.<br />Before reading Mac OS X and the Digital Lifestyle, I felt reasonably conversant with the fundamental of iMovie, iTunes, and iPhoto. (I have never paid attention to iDVD as neither of my Macs have a SuperDrive.) I could fool around with the various programs, and get some moderately interesting results. But I always felt I was never taking best advantage of the programs as a suite of applications.<br />Three pages into Mac OS X and the Digital Lifestyle, I knew this book was something special.<br />Using QuickTime Pro as a focal point, Miser lays out the graphics underpinnings of the iApps. The ability to import and export scads of file formats makes QuickTime Pro and especially iMovie extra-flexible. You learn that you can get almost any external file into your production, and how to best import it.<br />iTunes gets attention next, then iPhoto and iMovie. Each chapter, while not as comprehensive as specialized books on each iApp, gives plenty of detail. I especially appreciated tips relating each program to its siblings; how best to format an export from iTunes to get it into iMovie, for example.<br />After each member of the iApp suite has had its' turn, Miser gets to what is the best part of the book. He presents logical strategies for creating digital productions. These are not cookie-cutter \\"step 1, step 2\\" checklists that some beginner-level books use. Miser talks fundamentals, and uses general principles to help you learn how to use the iApps together to best effect. While each one has strengths and weaknesses, Miser shows you how to make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.<br />If you think I like this book, then think again.<br />I LOVED this book. It is well written, with easy-on-the-eyes formatting (less common than you may think), and it weighs less than 5 pounds. But the best part of reading Mac OS X and the Digital Lifestyle was the constant feeling I had of \\"so THAT is the best way to do that effect,\\" or \\"jeez, I was wasting a lot of time doing it my way.\\"<br />Rather than list all the chapter titles, I'll simply say you will learn all you need to know to use your digital camera, camcorder, CD/DVD burner with your Mac if buy and read Mac OS X and the Digital Lifestyle.<br />This is a must-buy for anyone who wants to get more out of their digital hardware and the iApps that ship with their Macintosh.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />David Weeks<br />...format an export from iTunes to get it into iMovie, for example.<br />After each member of the iApp suite has had its' turn, Miser gets to what is the best part of the book.

I was hoping Photoshop 7 Magic would teach me something new, something I did not know I could do with the new version of the program. Alas, that is not what this book is about.<br />Starting off with some very simple ways to use text, layers, and transparencies, the book moves into many different categories of Photoshop, from Marbled Backgrounds to Satin Beveled Type. The book is broken out into three main segments, Artistic Techniques, Web Techniques, and Image Manipulation Techniques.<br />The book features some really nice artwork and the accompanying CD-ROM has all the files you need to re-create the projects done in the book.<br />The book is well written, if somewhat Spartan. There is no sense of who the people are writing the book. It is \\"I did this, then I did that, etc...\\" With all the white space in this book, I would have liked to see a little more of the personalities of the writers come through. As it is, it is a boring read. Photoshop 7 Magic is a textbook, not an entertaining read. With the great pictures and examples in this book, it could have been so much more. Perhaps Sherry and Rhoda should take a page from another New Rider writer, Scott Kelby, and liven their work up a bit.<br />This book is geared to new Photoshop users, or graphic designers just now making the switch from brush and canvas to mouse, stylus pen, and monitor. Experienced graphic artists who have been using Photoshop for a few years will get little from this book they do not already know, or have learned from the countless book already available on the subjects covered in this book. Add to that and the very hefty price tag of the book, a whopping forty-five bucks, and I cannot recommend this book unless you are really lacking in Photoshop skills, unlike the demographic this book seems to be catering to.<br />Average book at best. Nice paperstock and heft to the book, but price is way too much for the quality of the 275 pages of actual content.

This very affordable book will help you become an accomplished digital artist.<br /> Theauthors explain in clear, concise prose how to install Elements and begin using it. Digital editing and creating is non-intuitive for many newbies (including me), and Hoeschen and Dahl's gentle user-friendly approach is refreshingly straightforward. The two-column Visual QuickStart format works perfectly to illustrate written directions and tips with pertinent screenshots, divided between the three operating systems; well over half the screenshots show the Mac interface (split between 9.2 and OS X).<br />At the heart of Elements and this guide is understanding and using the powerful LAYERS feature.

A quick search on Amazon shows 33 titles with his name on the cover, with some titles dating back to the Apple II and Atari 400 (!) days. Dennis Cohen, while not quite as prolific as Poole, has a substantial amount of computer writing experience. He also has spent time as a professional Macintosh programmer.<br />The MacWorld Mac OS X Bible clearly shows the years of writing experience at work here. It is a solid, well-crafted, and readable manual that covers Macintosh OS X 10.1. Be forewarned that it is not the be-all and end-all reference manual for aspiring Unix geeks. That market is better served by Mac OS X Unleashed.<br />The MacWorld Mac OS X Bible (hereafter referred to as Mac OS X Bible) is targeted at those who are upgrading to OS X, as well as those new to the Mac OS. Poole and Cohen present the material with a logical flow, discussing Mac OS X concepts, features, and tips. Most of the OS X material is followed with a compare-and-contrast with OS 9, so upgraders will be able to see how OS X differs from OS 9. I found this approach useful, as my mind works better by knowing how the new is different from the old, rather than just being told what's new.<br />Poole and Cohen cover the expected material; OS X basics, the Aqua user interface, Internet setup, how to use the included OS X applications, etc. This is familiar ground that every OS X book covers (or should cover). The author duo presents this information in a steady, workmanlike fashion. I did not learn anything new that other OS X titles had not covered. There is only so much one can write about Sherlock, and every book says much the same things. But the writing style is clear and easy to follow.<br />Part III: Beyond the Basics is the best part of this 779 page tome. The authors strike a good balance between too-simple and too-complex in their presentation of more advanced OS X concepts. Again, it is important to note that the target readership is beginner to intermediate level Macintosh users. Mac OS X Bible is not going to tell you much about using the included Apache web server to administer your personal web site. Nor is there a down and dirty how-to for advanced Terminal use.<br />But that's not the point. Most readers of this book want end-user information, not Unix administrator information. And that's what they get. The authors do a good job of covering User accounts and privileges, local area networks, and the various methods of sharing files (Web sharing, FTP, and remote login). It's the right mix of detail for the home or small-business Mac user who wants to do something, but who does not need the amount of detail that a professional administrator does.<br />Apple released OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) last month. Is this book (and review) obsolete? Not at all. It will take several months before the Jaguar books hit the shelves. Even then, the fundamentals of Max OS X will not have changed. MacWorld Mac OS X Bible is still very useful, even if you are using 10.2.<br />MacWorld Mac OS X Bible is a worthwhile competitor in the fight to be the best all-around OS X manual<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />David Weeks<br />[...]readership is beginner to intermediate level Macintosh users.

Personally, I would not know an LPR printer if I tripped over one in the hallway.<br />The last sections are devoted to learning the Unix applications included in OS X: the Apache web server, Sendmail, WebDAV, PHP. There is also a smattering of info on CGI programming. While both Apache and Sendmail have thousand-page tomes devoted to them, Ray and Ray provide enough detail for the Mac-centric OS X user to get a feel for the power of the Apache web server and the Sendmail application. While anyone can turn on Apache in the System Preferences, Apple provides virtually NO guidance or instructions. Unleashed will at least provide you with a good grounding in Apache basics. Ray and Ray discuss proper care and feeding of FTP sites is provided as well.<br />I generally do not like book reviews to be mere recitations of the various subjects covered. But I felt it important to show how much valuable information is contained in this one book! But raw information is of no use if it is not intelligently presented. The authors' writing style is crisp and to the point, and the example provided are relevant to real-world Macintosh computing. Too-small screen shots are my only objection to the production values. If publishers could figure out how to use paper that weighs less without sacrificing durability, then I would be even happier. This book is ponderous enough that it is difficult to hold in your lap to read. I had to lay it flat on a table to manage it.<br />Beginners should NOT waste their time and money on Mac OS X Unleashed. Buy Mac OS X: The Missing Manual. instead.

Unfortunately, most computer books tend to be massive tomes that are little more than elaborate regurgitation's of the skinny manuals and Help files shipping with the software itself. The reader learns little more than how to accomplish certain functions in a certain order. This is what I call the cookbook approach to computer manuals.<br />While there is a place for cookbook manuals, the best books transcend this genre, and teach both principles and background for understanding, as well as providing cookbook-style recipes for doing. David Pogue's most recent addition to his \\"Missing Manual\\" series does just this for Macintosh OS X. ...Mac OS X: The Missing Manual combines the basics of OS X for newbies, and provides a more-than-generous helping of advanced techniques and principles for power-users, or those who aspire to power-userdom. The primary reason I enjoyed Mac Mac OS X: The Missing Manual much more than the other OS X books I have read is that the book is simply fun to read. Pogue consistently writes with a light wit, yet he does not indulge in the sappy humor found in the \\"(fill in the blank) for Dummies\\" series. I learned something on almost every page, even though I consider myself an OS X power-user. Even the sections I did not need to read were interesting, and I felt little desire to skip ahead to chapters covering more advanced territory. Being able to hold the reader's attention is one mark of a good technical writer.<br />...Pogue includes plenty of coverage of Unix fundamentals, and he gives examples of using the Terminal application to do things that may be difficult or impossible in the Mac OS X graphic user interface. First, he makes it clear that diving into the Unixness inside OS X is optional for most users. Then he provides enough Unix instruction for the reader to get the task accomplished.<br />When I saw a detailed description of how to use the NetInfo database to create and edit User groups for file sharing purposes, I knew Pogue didn't shy away from addressing the more difficult parts of OS X. There is a substantial amount of advanced material for the intermediate to power-user to read and digest. The chapters on file permissions provided me the first thorough yet understandable overview of Unix file permissions I've read in a Macintosh-centric book.<br />In a refreshing display of candor, the author is not above admitting that certain features of OS X are less mature (or non-existent, for that matter) than in OS 9. Some aspects of administering file sharing in OS X are far less user-friendly than OS, ???NINE??? and Pogue makes no attempt to hide such unpleasant facts. Pogue's willingness to discuss OS X's faults and shortcomings is a pleasant surprise; most computer book authors tend to gloss over shortcomings of their subject application of operating system. Lest this review sound like a press release by the publisher, I do have a few quibbles with Mac OS X: The Missing Manual. I found the subject matter organization to be a bit confusing. For example, Part One, Chapter Two is titled \\"Organizing Your Stuff.\\" This covers how to best understand the OS X folder structure, and how to organize your files. However, Chapter 3 \\"Dock, Desk, and Toolbar\\" has lots of great information on how to use the organizational aspects of the Dock to get easy access to your files. While I suppose it would be hard to meld the two chapters, I did not like information on how to organize your drive being spread around several chapters. Another example of topics being covered in widely separated locations is when Pogue discusses problems with deleting certain files and folders, he refers the reader to tips located hundreds of pages away in another chapters. The unavoidable result is lots of page flipping and bookmarking. At least it's worth the effort...<br />It's almost certainly got the information you need, be you a new OS X user, an OS 9 convert, and a regular OS X user searching for a good reference work.<br />You will enjoy reading it, which is a rare thing for computer books.<br />If you read it all, you'll know 95% of what you will ever need for beginner to power-user (but not Unix geek) level usage. As of this writing, David Pogue's Mac OS X: The Missing Manual is the best OS X book for your dollar.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />David Weeks<br />[...]ou will enjoy reading it, which is a rare thing for computer books.<br />If you read it all, you'll know 95% of what you will ever need for beginner to power-user (but not Unix geek) level usage.

And at the top of the map, you'll see an enlarged view of southern Utah that features the many remarkable natural wonders located between St. George and Moab. This is Desert Solitaire country, as fans of author Edward Abbey know so well.<br />Over 300 miles from Four Corners, author/photographer/educator Tom Wiewandt lives in the Tucson Mountains, near Saguaro National Park in the Sonoran Desert. I met him at a pot luck dinner for the Arizona Native Plant Society, and was instantly impressed by his tales of dodging electrocution while taking photos of the area's powerful summer \\"monsoon\\" lightning storms.<br />Imagine my surprise two days later when a review copy of The Southwest Inside Out arrived, complete with award emblems for prizes this volume has already received. Five jaw-dropping minutes spent leafing through its pages convinced me that nature lovers worldwide need to know about the book.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The Southwest Inside Out delves into the geological origins of stunning landscapes that abound in this part of the world, clearly written for those of us who are curious but have no formal training in the earth sciences. But this book is much wider in scope: it offers a holistic overview that integrates scenic wonders with pre-history, plant and animal ecology, Native American mythology, recent history, and travel tips.<br />The lively, informative text is fully indexed and cleanly organized with side-bars for easy reading. Each page has been designed for maximum impact by the talented Carol Haralson, who deserves special mention. Wiewandt's photos are sensational, and no lesser adjective will suffice.<br />Seven major subject areas bring this far-ranging section of the United States into sharp focus. My favorites are:<br />* DUNES, with their austere majesty, hosting rugged, idiosyncratic life forms;<br />* WHERE WATER COMES AND GOES, explaining how horrible floods and devastating droughts will always be beyond our control;<br />* STORIES IN STONE, including charts and photos that place such creatures as trilobites, dinosaurs, and saber-tooth cats throughout the region.<br />Within each of these chapters are gorgeous landscape and nature photos, well-researched information, plus numerous illustrations and original maps. Check out Wiewandt's splendid photo gallery for sample pictures like those in his book. You can download photos from the website, but remember to respect his copyright.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Tom Wiewandt is a native to the American Southwest and has led photographic learning vacations throughout this region for 11 years, establishing a solid foundation for The Southwest Inside Out - An Illustrated Guide to the Land and Its History. His co-author, Maureen Wilks is a geologist and librarian for the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. I thought I knew the area well after living here for a dozen years, but I'm still a tenderfoot in comparison.<br />Two useful sections deserve special mention: \\"Where to Find Them\\" lists every worthwhile federal and state park and scenic area within this enormous geographic zone; and four pages of \\"Photo Tips\\" tell you what to do and how to do it for optimum results in such demanding light/rock/sky/desert environments.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The Southwest Inside Out sits prominently on my living room table, and I could have sold a dozen copies already to people who happened to pick it up for a \\"quick\\" glance. This book is attractive, informative, well-written, and inspiring for all ages and interests. You don't need to leave it at home. It has been built and designed to carry with you on the road, to be read on the fly.

The authors, Dave Johnson and Rick Broida, clearly love the Palm OS...in the same way a lot of Mac users love the Mac. In this book you'll find a nice defense of the Palm OS and all the instructions for using said miracle of miniaturization.<br />The first two thirds of How to Do Everything with Your Palm Handheld are pretty standard fair. Mostly how to do this and that with your Palm PDA...How to Do Everything with Your Palm Handheld really comes into it's own around chapter fourteen. The chapter is entitled \\"How to use you Palm as a laptop Replacement\\"...you'd be surprised with just how close you can come...other niftiness abounds system hacks for avoiding the capital letter stroke, hacks to use that leftover flash memory and methods to print to just about any printer with an IrDA port. Those are just a few of the enclosed tips that make the book worth having for the...power Palm users.<br />The style of the book is perhaps it's most appealing feature. Sure it's full of pictures and useful instructions...This keeps the book light and enjoyable instead of devolving into a monotone how to manual. The instructions are clear and easy to follow and the reasons to try something or the reasons to not try something are presented with equal weight with the consequences noted. All factors noted How to Everything with Your Palm Handheld is an engaging (for an instruction manual) and useful read.<br />Bottom Line: This is not a ground breaking book (perhaps it was three editions ago) and most if not all of the information is available elsewhere. Yet owing to the writing style and advanced user tips How to Do Everything with Your Palm Handheld would be a useful addition to any Palm user's library from novice to just short of Palm OS programmer.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5	2002-10-24

The Naked Truth. I even emailed Scott before we published it, telling him that Chris gave him pretty high marks for his book. (Writers HATE hearing from people who liked their book, in case you were wondering.) Then, a week later, Scott asked me to go read the review of his book at Amazon.com by Paul Thurrott, News Editor of Windows 2000 magazine. I did, and if anything, it simply proves the point Scott made in his book.<br />In response to Mr. Thurrott's review, I present this from Scott himself.<br />New Mac book enrages PC users<br />Scott Kelby's controversial new book, \\"Macintosh: the Naked Truth\\" has only been out a little more than a week, and PC users are already rushing to attack it, including Paul Thurrott, News Editor of Windows 2000 magazine who posted a scathing review of Scott's new book on Amazon.com. Thurrott called the book \\"An embarrassing pro-Mac manifesto for the truly clueless.\\"<br />\\"It's because of guys like him that I wrote the book in the first place,\\" said Kelby. \\"Actually, His comments made my case better than I ever could. Frankly, I wish I could've included his review in my book, because every Mac user can relate to an encounter with a PC user just like him,\\" he added.<br />Paul's blasting of Kelby's book hasn't hurt its popularity as it ranks as the 14th bestselling Macintosh book on Amazon.com. Kelby adds \\"I'm sure it's also the #1 most hated book by PC users who can't stand anyone telling the other side of the story.\\"<br />The book, and the review, can be found at Amazon.com (search for Macintosh: the naked truth)<br />I also posted our review of the book at Amazon.com's website. It is my hope that our more honest review helped sell more copies of the book that Mr. Thurrott's did to steer people away from it.<br />Our reviewer, Chirs, was not the only MyMac.com writer to receive a copy of the book from New Riders, the publisher of Macintosh... The Naked Truth. I also received a copy, but deferred writing a review in favor of Chris writing his. But now, with Mr. PC Weenie Thurrott's rant, I feel I should also put my own two cents in.<br />This is a great book for any Mac fan. The front cover of the book says it all: \\"An irreverent, off-the-wall, PC-slammin', totally-biased look at Apple, and what it's like to be a Mac user stuck in a Windows dominated world.\\"<br />That is what the book is all about. It is great, the type of Macintosh book I myself would have loved to write. Had I thought any publisher would have ever taken to the idea, this book would have been written by me a few years ago. (Though not as well written as Scott did, I am honest to say. I am not the master of the written word that Scott is!)<br />So all you Mac militants (and you know who you are!) Here is your chance to shut up a lying, bigmouth PC editor. Head over to Amazon.com and order this book today. It is only $ after all. Cheap for such a good read!

The Quickstart and Quickpro series are designed to fill a specific niche: books that tell you how to accomplish specific tasks using short textual explanations and graphics.<br />If you are the kind of computer user who want a book that will tell how to perform a specific task, and does not want to wade through a 678 page textbook to find the answer, this is the kind of book for you.<br />Langer covers the fundamentals of OS X with pithy explanations and screen snapshots. She does not waste your time with how to use Mail, Sherlock II, the Apache web server, or any other major OS X applications. She focuses like a laser on using the core parts of OS X.<br />You'll get a short description of OS X components, the Classic environment, Unix basics, networking, multiple users, AppleScript, and the various System preferences. The OS X utilities (Disk Utility, etc.) are also covered.<br />Langer has outsourced the chapters on Unix basics and Applescript to two outside writers. Unix is a fundamental part of OS X, and Langer clearly needs to devote some space to it. Ron Hipschman's discussion of Unix is the more challenging of the two. Unix can be a daunting topic for those of us who love the Macintosh user interface. Hipschman covers the fundamentals, but he makes it somewhat more complex than need be. I found that he sometimes neglects to define his terms (operand, syntax, etc.), and that made me reach for a dictionary.<br />But while the power of Unix is undeniable, I find it hard to imagine that the target reader for a Visual Quickpro book would be paging through the section on Unix permissions, and applying Terminal commands in a \\"cook-book\\" fashion to try to fix a permission problem. Hopefully, such a reader would realize that a little Unix knowledge can be dangerous, especially when used under pressure (like trying to fix a problem while under a deadline.) If readers truly want to become comfortable with Unix, then they should get a book more suited to learning Unix from scratch.<br />Ethan Wilde's AppleScript chapter is easier to digest, partly because the material will be more familiar to the average Mac OS user. His discussion of the power of AppleScript uses useful, real-world examples. These scripts would have been even better if Langer's companion website had provided the scripts in downloadable form, so the reader would not have to type the script from scratch, with the attendant chance of errors.<br />Mac OS X Advanced Visual Quickpro Guide is laced with many screenshots, as befits its' name. Unfortunately, the small size of many screenshots make them difficult to read, especially those that contain text. Larger shots would save the reader much eyestrain.<br />To this reviewer, one drawback of the Visual Quickstart series is that it is so task oriented. Langer does not provide much background as to why things are the way they are. You learn how to do specific tasks, but you don't learn how to apply that knowledge to other areas. However, because Visual Quickstarts are small books, you don't have to spend hours trying to find the right fix for your problem in some OS X book that is big enough to be a boat anchor.<br />So, if this the kind of computer book for you, Maria Langer's Mac OS X Advanced Visual Quickpro Guide is one of the better books in the field.<br />MacMice Rating: 3.5 out of 5&lt;Pne.)

Still, you think your newly birthed video masterpiece lacks something. Perhaps it's a unique blend or a splashy title. At the moment of export you might stop and wonder: \\"Should I upgrade to Final Cut Pro?\\" I can answer that question for you, just follow the following formula: (Money you plan to earn from this movie)+(Money you plan to earn with next 10 movies)/(cost of Final Cut Pro)=Justification. If \\"justification\\" is greater than 1, I say buy the program. If not it is far wiser, fiscally speaking, to stick with iMovie.<br />Does that mean you're stuck? Have you reached the absolute limits of iMovie? Are you forever wondering in a morass of lifeless titling and yearnings for a few special effects? Heck no, if you're willing to mess around with a couple other programs for a bit. Of course saying you're not stuck and showing you how to unstick yourself are two different things. So, you'll have to trust me, you're not stuck. That tidbit should be worth a nickel. To actually get unstuck you'll have to pony up $40.00 for iMovie 2 Solutions . With this handy offering by Erica Sadun you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how much you can get out of iMovie if don't mind mixing in a few other apps.<br />iMovie 2 Solutions is not really so much about iMovie, it's more about extending iMovie with the careful use of a few programs. That is not to say iMovie 2 Solutions doesn't have iMovie specific info, it does in spades (want to change the default \\"My Great Movie Title\\"? See page 4). Most of the iMovie specific tips are redundant or of little value. The value lies in combining iMovie with programs such as QuicktimePro, Adobe Photoshop Elements (nee Photoshop LE, I suspect if you have a copy of Photoshop LE most of the tricks will still work) and a few other assorted programs. It might seem strange to buy a book ostensibly about iMovie that focuses so heavily on other programs. Trust me again when I say it's money well spent as long as you realize iMovie 2 Solutions is in no way an iMovie tutorial or reference but indispensable if you want to trick out your movies to the maximum level of Jurassic Parkness..<br />By now the interested reader will begin wondering: \\"Just what kind of stuff will this book show me how to do?\\" I can't list all the tricks iMovie 2 Solutions covers (that's a lie, I could actually list all the tricks, but this is a review not an index) but I can point out a few that seemed particularly cool to me. Ones I particularly include: the \\"Big Titles\\" trick, See through Big Title trick, Movie in Movie trick and customized QuickTime skin playback tip. and, my uber fave, use iMovie to work on a silver screen sized movie instead of the default TV sized screen (a tip worth $999 clams for those who posses nice cameras but not Final Cut Pro). The aforementioned tips just scratch the surface of iMovie 2 Solutions there is plenty more movie making goodness contained within the wraparound softcover.<br />So we have established the book contains useful tips and/or tricks. Hence it's time to get down to style and presentation. After all, the world's most clever tip isn't worth much if it is presented in an obscure incomprehensible format. This is not a problem with iMovie 2 Solutions. The tips are presented in easy to follow steps illustrated with small thumbnail sized photos. The average number of steps seems to be about ten but range up to a still manageable twenty actions to get the desired effect. The writing is fairly comprehensible providing you know a bit about iMovie a little about Photoshop and a smidgen of QuicktimePro. If you don't know much about those programs I strongly suggest you read the book from the very beginning, it makes the going much easier.<br />iMovie 2 Solutions also comes with a super nifty CD that contains every program the author asks you to use to augment iMovie and a visual tutorial of each chapter. If you're on a 56k connection the 40-dollar price tag is worth the disc alone. If you're a Mac user from way back the disc is reminiscent of the floppies that came with the earliest Mac Bibles. By that I mean the disc is chock full of nifty utilities and such. You can have plenty of fun with the stuff on the disc without bothering to read the book.<br />Summation time: This book shows you plenty of stuff you never thought you could with iMovie at a reasonable price and gives you the tools to follow through.<br />MacMice Rating: 5 out of 5 *Power iMovie Users MacMice Rating: 3.5 out of 5 *Average iMovie Users&lt;Ption the 40-dollar price tag is worth the disc alone.

Oh sure you know you could do more with Adobe Photoshop Elements but you (like me) probably reason that whatever else you might be able to do would be difficult, time consuming and possibly of little practical value. Well Lisa Matthews is out to change your mind about extending your Adobe Photoshop Elements abilities with Adobe Photoshop Elements Idea Kit. Adobe Photoshop Elements Idea Kit is a different kind of book. It's not a reference manual by any stretch of the imagination. Instead Adobe Photoshop Elements Idea Kit does provide something most books don't: a bit of inspiration. The Idea Kit doesn't house a whole slew of ideas but the ideas found between the covers are very useful and left me in a constant state of \\"Hey, why didn't I think of doing that?\\"...Of course all these ideas aren't worth much if the instructions are hard to follow or so tedious that you'd never actually bother to attempt the project (notice how many people do macram&eacute;?). No worries about the clarity of the instructions, if you have trouble following this book you may want to take an English language refresher course at the local community college. The instructions aren't overly tedious either, you never feel that you've wasted your time reading and working through a project. Still some of the projects would be hard to complete if you had to whip your own bit of Photoshop goodness for ragged picture corners or something, fortunately you don't. Lisa Matthews includes a CD with a plethora of templates and other goodies you need to finish these projects. Here it's important to remember that Lisa Matthews is a Photoshop uber guru so her stuff looks much better than what the average Joe could generate. Think of the CD as a low cost sampling of pro level goodies.<br />It's hard to criticize this book on any one level, and I wish there were more books that focused the end product rather than the minutiae of a program...Adobe Photoshop Elements Idea Kit is a real find for Adobe Photoshop Elements novices who want to get the most bang for their Adobe dollar and may even help intermediate users to think of new things to do with Adobe Photoshop Elements but I was left wanting a few more ideas.<br />MacMice Rating: 3.5 out of 5ere were more books that focused the end product rather than the minutiae of a program...Adobe Photoshop Elements Idea Kit is a real find for Adobe Photoshop Elements novices who want to get the most bang for their Adobe dollar and may even help intermediate users to think of new things to do with Adobe Photoshop Elements but I was left wanting a few more ideas. <br />MacMice Rating: 3.5 out of 5	2002-10-24

Each keyboard shortcut that is explained works with Mac and Windows, either platform specific or both computer platforms. Each is listed as either / or, so you can skip a shortcut if it does not apply to your computing environment.<br />The book is broke out into six main sections, each representing a different section of QuarkXPress. They are Palettes, Interface, Menus, Moving, Text, and Pictures and Lines. This is very handy, enabling you to quickly browse and find the keyboard shortcut you want to learn. As there are over 400 shortcuts listed in the book, you will find yourself going back to this book often. Other sections of the book cover Function Keys, Context-Sensitive Menus, Special Characters, The ANSI Character Set, and The Ten Best-Kept Secrets.<br />Like most books, this one also sports an index, though compared to many other books on the market today, QuarkXPress Power Shortcuts has an exceptional index. Bravo to PeachPit Press!<br />While this is a relatively thin book, it is packed with great content for any QuarkXPress user.  I would give this book a perfect five out of five rating if not for the larger price tag.<br />All in all, QuarkXPress Power Shortcuts makes a great reference for QuarkXPress users. This kind of documentation should be with a printed manual that ships with the product itself.<br />MacMice Rating: 4 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Tim	2002-10-24

Heck if you have a newish Mac you know it comes pre loaded with iTunes for music, iPhoto for pictures, iMovie for making your own movies and iDVD for cramming that newly made movie on a DVD disc. Thats a lot of programs to take in all at once and if you have a new Mac you know that the manuals are nonexistent. So are you left running out to buy a book for each program? Maybe not, perhaps Jesse Feilers book \\"Making Movies, Photos, Music and DVDs on Your Mac\\" can answer your specific needs for a fraction of the price of four individual tomes and with a good deal more depth than an all-encompassing Mac reference.<br />The first problem with the \\"Making Movies, Photos, Music and DVDs on Your Mac\\" is the title. It might trick you. Jesse Feilers book is not about making music or photos on your Mac, its about organizing and manipulating said multimedia. I suppose that objection is a minor quibble, after all it is the stuff between the covers that counts. \\"Making Movies, Photos, Music and DVDs on Your Mac\\", from now on referred to as MMPMD, starts out fairly basic. On page five Jesse Feiler covers the importance of \\"thinking digital\\" noting that today's computers are digital. Computers (the kind Jesse is thinking of) have been digital since 1937 but other media has been heading steadily towards the land of 1 and 0s for the last few years. The progression of media to the digital realm is what makes the Mac a digital hub and what makes MMPMD worth reading as long as you ignore anything that doesnt pertain directly to computers or digital equipment.<br /><br />Just what am I talking about? An example resides on page 21 where Jesse Feiler is chatting about visual perception. Sure this topic may seem a bit extraneous to some (and I would agree) but if youre going to jam this kind of information in you should at least get it right. After noting that you need your brain to see (who knew?) we are treated to the following:<br />\\"Light, like all other electromagnetic radiation, consists of waves. All electromagnetic waves behave in the same way. This is why sound, light, infrared, X-rays, and gamma rays all exhibit similar behavior\\"<br />This is not some quibble about wave/photon duality or some other obscure quantum mechanical complaint my beef is a bit more basic: Just when did sound become an electromagnetic wave? Its been a couple of years since my class in classical mechanics but way back in 97 science was pretty sure that sound waves were mechanical.<br /><br />Once we get the first chapter out of the way we can begin to actually eye the book for the intended purpose of using our Mac to the fullest in the increasingly digital world. So how do the remaining 24 chapters hold up? Generally pretty well, the prose is easily understandable and the book is full of useful iMovie tips I havent seen elsewhere. The iPhoto information is quite thorough and useful and the iTunes chapters are more than passable. The last few chapters are \\"case studies\\" which are fairly useful to help the reader realize just what the \\"hub\\" can do.<br /><br />While mostly solid (say 85%) MMPMD also has more than its fair share of \\"why the hell is this here?\\" spots where you are left wondering what the point was of the last few pages. A prime example of this can be found in the chapter on Applescript. The reader is treated to a couple pages full of Applescript terms and lines of Applescript code but not enough info to write a useful Applescript. The point of the chapter seems to involve a wish to get the reader to learn Applescript elsewhere and noting that there are quite a few useful downloadable scripts. My question remains: why did I wade through all that Applescript stuff just to find out I need to get a different book to actually write an Applescript?<br />Bottom Line: When MMPMD is going well its full of tricks and solid tips. When MMPMD is going bad it can be quite a time waster. My advice to those who buy this book: Make frequent use of the index to avoid the tangential information scattered throughout MMPMD.<br />MacMice Rating: 2 out of 5<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chris Seiboldseful downloadable scripts.

Ed Zolli realizes the inherent difficulty of predicting the future but still remains bold enough to edit together some well-informed guesses in \\"Tech TV's Catalog of Tomorrow\\"...<br />\\"Tech TV's Catalog of Tomorrow\\" has a well-ordered layout. First divided into very broad but related sections like \\"Our Tools\\" or \\"Our Society.\\" The broad categories are winnowed down a bit to section titles like \\"Computing\\" or \\"Nanotechnology\\" followed finally by individual article with titles like \\"Broadband\\" and \\"Cyborgs.\\" This makes the book easy to navigate and reference but saps some of the fun out of \\"Tech TV's Catalog of Tomorrow\\". Since you always know exactly what's coming there's never one of those \\"Wow, look what I found\\" feeling you while thumbing through less organized futuristic looking tomes.<br />The real meat of the book is, of course, the individual articles. Each article is accompanied by a timeline for likely adoption of the topic at hand, two circles indicting relative risk and benefit, a color photograph or artists rendering and a few related links for those still curious after reading the article. It's visually pleasing format and very well laid out but the topics and prose are really what we're after. The topics for the articles run from utterly predictable \\"Gene Therapy\\" (already in use to a small extent) to the seemingly outlandish \\"Floating Cities\\"(a 4,500 foot boat). I prefer the more outlandish future predications but \\"Catalog of Tomorrow\\" keeps mostly to the rational. I suppose this is because the articles are well written and researched and not mere speculation that some authors are known to trot out. I would predict that \\"Catalog of Tomorrow\\" will probably fare better than average if reviewed for accuracy in a hundred years, still some groundless guessing would have been great for entertainment value.<br />No one book is going to make everyone happy and this was the case for me while reading \\"Tech TV's Catalog of Tomorrow\\". It's not that I think it's a bad book, it's just not what I am used to when authors opine on the future...If you are partial to a more factual, logically sound bit of crystal gazing then \\"Tech TV's Catalog of Tomorrow\\" is for you.<br />Bottom Line: Nicely written, nicely illustrated, and even oversized. \\"Tech TV's Catalog of Tomorrow\\" is above average in every way.<br />MacMice Rating: 3 out of 5...ng \\"Tech TV's Catalog of Tomorrow\\".

The Naked Truth<BR>Chris Seibold (mymac.com)<br />I have never written a book review before, and I enter the project with some trepidation. Will I make a mortal enemy of the author? Will this hurt my career as an engineer? And most importantly: Will I have to force myself to read the book? My last worry was unfounded; I liked Scott Kelby's Macintosh...The Naked Truth.<br />Macintosh...The Naked Truth runs a bit high for 219 pages but it's a fairly enlightening and quick read. By easy reading I don't mean the tome is some monosyllabic Dr. Suess rip-off, Scott Kelby uses fine prose and a vocabulary that is not \\"dumbed down\\" Yet, as one reads the book, one has the feeling that it was written at a frenetic pace. This is overtly noted in the book and carries through to the final product. The reader is left with the impression that the author believes that any thought the flashes through his noggin as he writes is pretty much worth our time, as Mac aficionados, to read. Surprisingly, the majority of the thoughts that Scott Kelby has are pretty darn interesting. In short, the book isn't so much about computers, though there is plenty of computer info, it's about being a Mac owner, a Mac enthusiast and the daily travails and pleasantries of Mac life.<br />I should also note that the book has a few jokes. By a few jokes I mean two or three jokes per paragraph. I have just read five randomly chosen paragraphs and four of them opened with jokes, that's a lot of jokes for a book ostensibly about computers. The jokes fly around like gags in a Naked Gun movie. Gags are everywhere hoping to overwhelm your sense of humor by sheer volume if necessary. Some hit and some miss, I'd say they ratio is roughly fifty-fifty. Normally I wouldn't enjoy comedy styling with so many misses but when Scott Kelby misses it is usually not by much and when he hits the results are laugh out loud funny. Only one other author makes me laugh out loud, the widely enjoyed Bill Bryson, so Mr. Kelby is in pretty good company.<br />The highlights of the book are the pages about CompUSA's store within a store strategy. I won't spoil the surprise, it is hilarious, deftly done and it makes the entire book worthwhile. The low point was the letters from PC user section. I know that reading hate mail and the requisite clever responses can be entertaining (it is everyone's favorite part of my site) but it doesn't quite work in the book. It's hard to get excited about hate mail coming to a magazine when you're not looking at said magazine and hence that chapter feels a bit distant. Plus the pseudonymous Mr. Kelby assigns are fairly inane (Major Dumass, Archibald Stuffybut? Come on Scott you can do better).<br />Overall I feel certain that any dyed in the wool Mac user will thoroughly enjoy the book. Besides possibly being the first book about being a Mac guy there is enough info for the book to also be a nice reference. The indifferent Mac user and the indifferent Windows will be entertained enough to feel that their money and time was well spent. The rabid Windows promoter (and I believe these people actually exist) will read the book and send Scott some hate mail.<br />Mac Mice Rating<BR>Mac Lovers:<BR>4 of 5 Mice<BR>General Public (people who use Windows so they can steal software from work): <BR>3 of 5 Mice<BR>Bill Gates, the President of Compaq, PC only Software companies:<BR>1 of 5 Mice	2002-03-20
