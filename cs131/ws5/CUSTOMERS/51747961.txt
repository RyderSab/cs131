For example, Claudine offers explanation and instruction for several different types of image transfer techniques, from transfers using common tape or laminate to more unusual transfers using heat or even Elmer's clear caulk material. And forget about messy glues and decoupage mediums -- Claudine suggests an interesting way of using beeswax in assembling and even coloring your collage. Several other techniques i.e. peeling paint, will lend themselves to applications in many other media. There is also an interesting lesson in assembling a &quot;frame&quot; for your finished pieces that is both simple and effective.  I found all of her instructions to be exceptionally clear and easy to follow.<br />Finally, I found Claudine's collage style to be refreshing. These days it seems that collage means seeing how many interesting or artsy things you can pile onto a canvas or paper. Yet Claudine's style is refereshingly spare, proving that it isn't quantity that counts, but quality.  And there is plenty of quality in this wonderful and inspiring book!	2004-01-14

He takes a more intellectual approach to investigating the murder of a prominent Psychoanalytic Institute's most respected member.  The reader can see the obvious (and in this case, ironic) parallels between psychoanalysis and police investigation.  The depth to which the author is able to illuminate the art of psychotherapy and how its unique conditions contribute to the mystery of this murder is also fascinating and makes this story more than just your average murder mystery.<br />This could be thought of as a thinking person's mystery -- there's very little gore or lurid descriptions of crime scenes, and no violent confrontational scenes you might find in Patricia Cornwell's or Jonathan Kellerman's writing.  The horror of the crime and the necessity of figuring out who committed it is no less compelling, however. The book takes a slow start, introducing the characters in a philosophical/analytical style, but the complexity of the case and the implications of &quot;whodunnit&quot; were more than interesting enough to draw me in until the last page.	2001-02-07

We also follow Petra and a few of the other battle school graduates as they show that they have matured past being just child genuises used as pawns by adults to save humanity. In this story, we finally see them using their own resources as they act alone to save themselves. <br />Peter Wiggin, formerly known as the sadistic brother of Ender, becomes a fully rounded character, both impossibly arrogant and charismatic. In my opinion it is this interaction between Bean and Peter Wiggin and what they accomplish together which is truly the gem in the midst of this high-stakes story of world diplomacy.  And it is this relationship, and Peter's subsequent rise to power that sets the stage for this story's obvious continuance.	2001-01-09

Biblical fiction isn't a &quot;hot&quot; topic, but after reading &quot;The Red Tent&quot; by Anita Diamont, I was curious as to how one of my favorite sci-fi authors would approach such a story.<br />The story of Sarah and her husband Abraham is one I half-heard about in Sunday school as a child.  Orson Scott Card brings it vividly to life so that the characters become more than just biblical figures, but real people with real lives, real doubts, and real faith. The book does start slow, but as I read on I found myself appreciating Card's ability to take time with the everyday aspects of Sarah and Abraham's lives rather than focusing entirely on the dramas and miracles of biblical proportion.<br />Regardless of whether or not you agree with Card's basic religious assumptions or his interpretation of Sarah and Abraham's story, this book is still a great example of Card's artful storytelling at its best.	2001-01-03

Riding the roller coaster of one woman's doubts, fears, and hopes as her wedding approaches was enjoyable.  The writing style is intelligent and sometimes understated, which only adds irony and humor to some of the hysterical moments in which the main character finds herself. <br />Quotes like, &quot;They say swans mate for life.  I wish they could talk.  I have questions.&quot;, or &quot;Suddenly, it's not just a sock on the floor, it's a sock on the floor for the rest of my life!&quot; are priceless, delivered in the narrator's quirky but likeable voice.<br />I had thought that the subject of this book would be a bit tiresome, but in reality, I found that there was much more to this story than planning a wedding; It's a story about taking great leaps in life. I laughed, I cried, I wished my boyfriend could understand.	2000-12-25

Perhaps it was the voice of the narrator -- In \\"The Law of Similars,\\" the story is told from the point of view of a local prosecutor (recently widowed) who falls in love with his homeopath.  Predictably, the beautiful homeopath soon finds herself in the midst of trouble. I would rather have heard less about how our narrator uses his own legal knowledge to try and \\"help\\" his homeopath, and heard more about the homeopath herself. But aside from this short-coming, the story did manage to finish with some unexpected reactions from the main characters, more than enough to make it a good read.	2000-12-24

I did finish it, however, and was pleasantly surprised at the ending ... <br />The main character's struggle with drug addiction and other dysfunctional behaviors is depressing, for sure. The author seems to stop just short of outright shocking the reader, while still managing to build some sympathy for each of the female characters. I kept reading out of the urge to eavesdrop on this somewhat generic terrible life to see just how bad it could get. Thankfully, at the end the characters became \\"real\\" to me, rather than puppets acting out a sad tale of the destruction ofaddiction. <br />Given the subject matter, however, perhaps thisdichotomy is just what the author intended.

The is a story of two sociologists who embark upon a research project to infiltrate and observe a small cult which claims to be in contact with higher beings from outerspace.  Instead of focusing too much on the exact identities of the members of the cult itself and its somewhat ridiculous belief system, the story hones in on the reactions and behaviors of the two sociologists who try (with varying degrees of sucess and failure) to participate &quot;non-directively&quot; in the group. Each researcher finds himself struggling (consciously or not) with the ideas of how much of group belonging can determine identity, and how much identity which emmanates from within can influence the group identity.<br />It's not clear by the end of the story just what separates faith and determination from delusions of grandeur and compulsion. But it was this question, not the story itself, that remained in my mind long after I finished the book.	2000-12-21

The story is intertwined with issues of a deeper spiritual nature, but there's nothing &quot;preachy&quot; about it -- just the true soul-searching of a young woman sifting through the stories of her past and the beliefs she was raised with to find her own place in the world.<br />This story hinges on the scene where young Margaret childishly tries to &quot;punish&quot; her mother for having to share her mother's affections with her mother's eccentric artist friend who blows into town and changes all their lives. Tragically, it is the last time Margaret sees her mother. It may sound melancholy at first, but there is much more to this story than the tragedy of a girl who loses her mother in childhood. <br />As all good stories often do, it ends with some surprises, and leaves just the right amount of burning questions unanswered. Look for the sequel, and find Margaret grown up and still struggling with the echoes of her past in &quot;Evensong.&quot;	2000-12-21

Not only are the  characters rich and alternately likeable and disdainful, but the story  takes realistic (yet riveting) turns that force the reader to examine their  own deeply held beliefs. I found myself thinking hard about who we believe  we are, and how that colors the way we see the others around us.

However, the underlying themes about feminine identity and being a woman in what all too often seems like a &quot;man's world&quot; are what linger in the reader's mind  long after the plot has concluded.

Still another woman fulfills all of society's expectations, struggling to  live the perfect life; only to find herself essentially empty in the end.

Read this if you love someone who is depressed  and is trying &quot;new&quot; antidepressants, not just because it will  give you a good grasp of the workings of the drugs themselves, but also  because it illuminates beautifully the day to day experiences of dealing  with depression.	1999-03-25

However, if you are truly depressed, you aren't going to care particularly for  following specific guidelines and eating habits, much less have the  attention span to get through the whole book in less than 6 months.  A  great book for those dealing with milder forms of depression, or those who  want to boost their emotional well-being.	1999-03-25
