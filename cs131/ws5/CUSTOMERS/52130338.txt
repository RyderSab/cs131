From the first riveting page until the final echo, this book gripped me like few others have done.  I am not usually a fan of government conspiracies or politics but \\"Night Fall\\" is different.  It sweeps you along with the action, the mystery, and the inevitable conclusion which I found breathtaking.<br /><br />Mr. DeMille, you have a brand new fan.	2005-01-11

I usually read more fiction than anything else, as I am a fiction writer myself.  \\"The Courage to Write\\" is without a doubt the best non-fiction I have read in years--maybe ever!<br /><br />  I borrowed this copy from the library but I plan to buy my own very soon so that I can refer to it whenever I have a case of \\"page fright.\\"  For decades I have wondered what was wrong with me, why I would write for a while and then lose momentum and eventually stop, shoving my manuscript into a drawer.  I just thought I didn't have enough talent or, as Mr. Keyes touches on in one chapter, that I was afraid of the reaction of family members if I were to write honestly.  That is indeed one of my fears, but how relieved I was to learn that many, many writers feel the same way!<br /><br />  After I finished the book, I immediately turned to my writing journal where I jot all kinds of notes, ideas, and such about my writing.  I raved on and on about \\"The Courage to Write,\\" and even e-mailed Mr. Keyes a personal thanks for having inspired me.  This is one book that will be referred to often.	2004-09-01

My litmus test for any book is 50 pages.  If it hasn't grabbed me by then it's probably not going to, and since I always have plenty of other books waiting to be read I put it aside and move on.  \\"The Way the Crow Flies\\" didn't even make it past page 40.  I was SO bored I could hardly stay awake.  I admit it had promise.  The post-World War II setting drew me, as I grew up in the 50s and 60s myself.  For some reason I took an instant dislike to Mimi, the mother.  All the endless detail involved in driving onto the base and Jack moving into his office, all the background of his days as a pilot I found incredibly tedious.<br /><br />  I realize many great books start slowly and build into something wonderful (example: \\"...And Ladies of the Club\\" by Helen Hooven Santmyer) and this book may very well be one of them.<br /><br />  Bottom line: I just didn't have the patience to find out.	2004-09-01

I had eagerly anticipated reading this book, hoping it might help me in my own research in writing about serial killers. However, I learned very little that I had not already read in other books by other, more informed authors, i.e., John Douglas.<br /><br /> Dr. Morrison's know-it-all attitude especially grated on my nerves. According to her, her theories are the right ones and everyone else's are wrong. Her ego is without equal.<br /><br /> As she interviewed one after another of these heinous killers, she kept asking &quot;why?&quot; And she kept answering &quot;I don't know.&quot;<br /><br /> Well, I don't know about you, but I read the book to find out &quot;why,&quot; and I don't know any more now than I did when I started. I'm afraid Dr. Morrison needs to take a course in humility. Too bad. In other hands this might have been an enlightening book.	2004-08-02

I almost put the book aside several times because of Molly Burke.  I found her to be insufferable!  The oh-so-witty repartee she and other characters engaged in was over the top.  I kept wanting her to get on with it.  And the constant bickering and downright nastiness between Molly and her so-called boyfriend Frank was sickening.  I'd hate to see how she would treat a guy she REALLY doesn't like!<br />The only reason I kept reading was to find out who was sending her the &quot;gifts&quot; and notes, and I will say the ending was a real surprise which I had not figured out.<br />I will try another Eileen Dreyer book but probably not one featuring Molly Burke.	2004-04-28

I almost dreaded turning each page, in fear of what might happen next.  But as the pages waned and I saw that I was close to the end I started to become perplexed.  I prepared myself for a slam-bang ending, only to be severely disappointed by the climax and ending.  What a letdown!  I couldn't believe the author had copped out this way.  I'm just glad I hadn't bought the book!  The two stars I gave it are only for the scare it gave me--for a while, that is.	2003-04-08

My expectations were met beautifully until the last forty pages.

Only 280 pages, this book packs such a  wallop it doesn't need to be any more wordy. With only a small handful of  characters, each finely drawn, Mr. Westlake keeps things simple very  effectively, without having to resort to an overly populated cast. The  story starts out as a simple case of quid pro quo.  Two writers meet:  successful Bryce Proctorr, whose story-telling well has dried up, and the  less well-known Wayne Prentice, able to write but not able to sell.  They  strike a bargain.  Proctorr will publish Prentice's latest book under his  own name and split the $1 million advance 50/50.  But Proctorr has a hook:  &quot;My wife must be dead.&quot; Unlike other books of this sort, Westlake  takes us to places in the human mind we would rather not go, places rife  with psychological landmines.  We watch in horror as the two writers' lives  slowly become one. The shocking ending is quite startling and unexpected,  yet not entirely surprising.  I didn't seriously believe the author would  go there ... but he did.	2000-03-25

That's usually a pretty good indicator to how I'm feeling about the author and his/her writing.  But in an effort to be fair, I read &quot;A Suggestion of Death&quot; and actually stayed with it through the end.  There was no urgency, no excitement of any kind, and it was certainly not a  page-turner.  The only slightly interesting character was the receptionist,  Beverly.  The ending was especially bad; it just fell with a dull thud.  By  that point I really didn't care anymore.  All in all, this book was a dud.	2000-03-05

The occasional mention of  characters from the other book made this story a wonderful blending of the  two, peopled with characters you feel you know intimately.  Another case of  not wanting the book to end.  I was a bit disappointed in the ending,  however.  I wanted to know more, a lot more!	2000-02-25

I'd never heard of Ursula Hegi before or any of her books, but now that I've been educated I will look for each new book.  I disagree with many of the  other reviewers who said the first part of the book was uninteresting.  I  found the whole book gripping and it wouldn't let go, even after it ended.  &quot;Stones from the River&quot; is one of those books whose characters  seem as real as your own family and you don't want to lose them when the  story ends.	2000-02-25

I don't know how I've missed him, since I'm a more than avid reader, but I was very pleased with &quot;Cold Case.&quot;  I read it in record time because I just couldn't  stop turning the pages.  I really like Alan Gregory's character.  He  reminds me a bit of Jonathan Kellerman's Alex Delaware, and I liked Lauren  Crowder much better than Delaware's live-in, Robin.  Even the dog, Emily,  was a good character.  The book certainly captured my interest and the  ending lived up to the rest.  I'll be looking for all the other Alan  Gregory books.	2000-02-05

That's the reason I kept reading until the end, but it never happened.  Granted, the author seemed to be up on his science, but as a  writer, my granddaughter could do better on a school essay! I actually  laughed out loud when I read characters in the eighth century using the  word &quot;OK.&quot;  The author also constantly throws in meaningless  &quot;asides,&quot; and goes off on tangents only he can understand.

I did  enjoy the story, in spite of the predictability, and the never-ending  cliffhangers.  I found myself almost overwhelmed by so much action; there  was never a dull moment.

I should have trusted my instincts.  I almost never like a book that Oprah suggests.  But I wanted  to read this book because I had read &quot;River Angel&quot; and liked it.  So I wanted to see what else Ansay could do.  I didn't like any of the  characters because I didn't feel that any of them HAD any character, except  maybe Amy.  I had heard that the mother-in-law, Mary-Margaret, was the  villain in this piece, but I thought Fritz and James were much, much worse.  And Ellen must have been born without a spine.  It really angered me when  she was going to follow the ambulance to the hospital and Amy asked to go  along, and Ellen told her to stay home with her horrible grandfather.  What  kind of mother would do that?  James' character made me so sick I wanted to  shake some sense into him.  Sadly, I've known a few men like him and I  think they are just beyond contempt.  And finally, the constant moving back  and forth between past and present tenses made me crazy.  It made me very  disoriented.  Will I ever read another Ansay book?  Doubtful.	1999-12-09

And I'm pretty hard to please.  I felt as if I personally knew Father Jack and Maggie, which is a tribute to Michael C. White.  It takes a  rare talent for an author to make the characters seem so alive.  I even  found myself crying more than once.  Although I suspected Maggie's true  feelings for Father almost from the beginning, that was okay.  It kept me  wondering: will she or won't she declare herself to him?  This book, while  about a horrible crime, was really more about love and loyalty.  The ending  was very refreshing as well.  It was much more true to life than in most  books in which all the loose ends are neatly tied up.  I'm going to read A  Brother's Blood next and will look forward to more books by this author.	1999-12-03

I read The Notebook, which was very predictable but sort of enjoyable.  Then I read Message in a Bottle, which was not quite so  predictable but seemed very contrived.  Then I read A Walk to Remember.  I  have been writing fiction, mostly for my own enjoyment, for most of my life  but have never been published.  If I had known this was all it takes to get  published, let alone write a bestseller, I would be rolling in money by  now.  A Walk to Remember is the most revolting attempt at fiction I have  ever read.  An eight-year-old could have written something more  entertaining.  Mr. Sparks must be writing either for children or dullards.  To say the ending was entirely predictable is an understatement of the  largest magnitude.  No more Sparks books for me (and I'll bet he's laughing  all the way to the bank!).  By the way, I think Amazon should offer a  rating of 0 stars, because one star is too good for this one.	1999-11-24

The story was packed with sufficiently creepy characters, several possible suspects, and it kept me turning the pages.  But the ending was very disappointing in  that I felt it was rushed, as if the author was in a big hurry to wrap it  all up without enough proper explanations.  For instance, what finally  happened to the Hopkinses?  And what happened with Georgie's career.  And  why were we not given so much as a clue to the true identity of the killer  until the very end?  Also I found the author's skipping back and forth from  past to present tense very annoying.  Once she even did it in the same  paragraph!	1999-11-22

I found them to be overly tedious; the book overly populated with characters, many of whom were  unnecessary; and the whole thing overly long and overly confusing.

Those who said his characters are weak don't know  what they're talking about!  I felt as if I knew each and every character  personally, except for Richard.  I could not guess what he was going to do  next. I enjoyed the way the author kept all the details of the seances  hidden throughout the book.  It's much scarier to imagine what's happening  than to read a blow-by-blow description. The story filled me with a creepy  sense of dread as I stayed up until four a.m. to finish it.

She makes Eve so stubborn, willful and  downright obnoxious I just want to throttle her.

I guess I keep hoping for something better than the last book, but they just keep getting more and more boring and mired in theology lessons.  Instead of feeling as  if I've just read a murder mystery, I feel as if I've just attended a  lengthy lecture course on theology.  I come away exhausted and wondering  where the excitement, the tension, and the suspense were hiding.  Clearly,  Mr. Kienzle misses preaching.  His characters deliver multi-paragraphed  speeches, not dialogues. And the pesky quotation marks, while grammatically  accurate, are confusing.  I'm constantly checking them to be sure who is  talking.  I used to look forward to Kienzle's novels, but I think &quot;No  Greater Love&quot; has cured me.	1999-08-01
