US	52924710	ROCSSFP67QE7L	006052197X	290297657	The Seduction of Silence	Books	2	5	11	N	N	This isn't a book about India	The novel is a saga of an Indian family that spans four generations. Aakash is the spiritual founder of Prakriti, a fertile farm in the Himalayas. Despite a loveless marriage to Jyoti Ma, Aakash sires two children, a boy, Ram, and a girl, Tulsi Devi. Ram leaves home for the hills when young; Tulsi Devi goes to a convent school to study. Due to terrible circumstances, she instead has a baby boy, Jivan, and is forced in to a marriage with Colonel Chopra. Their child, Rohini, leaves for England in the '60's with an English beatnik. Saakshi, Rohini's daughter, brings the saga squarely back home as she returns to Prakriti to have her child there.<br />Hunte has suggested, in a recent interview, that her novel could be classified in the \\"spiritual realism\\" genre. She is yet another author who claims that her book is not really \\"Indian\\" while constantly leaning on Indian spiritual mysticism to make it different. Remove the mumbo-jumbo, however, and all you have left is an ordinary, occasionally spicy saga on your hands.<br />Most of the events in The Seduction of Silence are unrealistic. Hunte also delves into the Hinduism bin at the drop of a hat. In the beginning, Aakash lets go of his young (six year old?) son into the woods seemingly for ever with the son telling him: \\"God will provide and so far we have never gone without our needs being met.\\" Spiritual this may be, realistic it ain't. About the only time that The Seduction of Silence gets believable is when Saakshi arrives, towards the end. Her quest for her roots seems believable probably because \\"many details of Saakshi,\\" as Hunte says, \\"were lived rather than imagined.\\"<br />Spirituality and fatalism are surely a part of India but Hinduism in India is more a way of life. One does not stay in motels and have aghoris (worshippers of Kali who eat their meals out of human skulls) knock on our doors, as Hunte would have us believe; the spirituality in India is much more subtle. <br />Many in India have objected to such\\"mystical\\" portrayals of the country and for good reason. Very often, the line between myth and reality is blurred. Books like The Seduction of Silence only serve to reinforce unfortunate stereotypes of India as a \\"mystical land filled with chanting mendicants.\\"	2003-01-10

This work, however, lacks the heft of Fussell's earlier works, including The Great War and Modern Memory and Class. Uniforms reads more like a haphazard collection of \\"scrap material\\" rather than a detailed analysis of its subject. Fussell also does little to answer the titular question: \\"why we are what we wear.\\"<br />One of the advantages that a uniform affords its wearer is the ability to skimp on \\"the work of remaking one's external character all the time.\\" That, of course, is one of a uniform's many advantages, but the flip side is a concurrent loss of individuality. Sometimes, as in the case of Levi's blue jeans, an effort to rebel and stand out gets adopted by so many, that it becomes the new uniform.<br />As would be expected, Uniforms talks about all manner of military attire and even the general military attitude (many a generalization here!) of a nation's people. <br />Besides military uniforms, Fussell also briefly points out uniforms in many other codes of dress. A nuptial dress, which is usually white, religious uniforms, and Boy Scout uniforms are but some of the examples outlined in the book. Long baggy boys' shorts and pants, we learn, are derived from prison wear as an act of rebellion against parents. Then of course there is the cute UPS truck driver in his cool brown uniform classified as \\"delivery chic.\\" <br />In his book, Fussell points out the overwhelming masculinity of the subject (women came to uniforms pretty late). He also says that: \\"Dressing approximately like others is to don armor against contempt.\\" Any woman who has tried buying her guy a purple shirt can attest to the verity of both of those statements....	2003-01-10

Theresa is fifteen here, beautiful (Liz Taylor looks) and has an easy way with kids and pets.<br />Theresa's parents moved out to Long Island a long time ago to give their child the opportunity to move in the right circles: \\"They moved way out on Long Island because they knew rich people lived way out on Long Island, even if only for the summer months, and putting me in a place where I might be spotted by some of them was their equivalent of offering me every opportunity.\\"<br />Theresa handles her charges with amazing ease-fixing lunches, changing diapers, soothing egos with a practised caring hand. She takes daily walks to the beach with her cousin and assorted charges tagging along. Theresa's grace attracts the attentions of lonely men around her. She herself is keenly aware of her emerging sexuality: \\"my childish beauty was quickly becoming something a little thinner and sharper and certainly more complicated\\" she complains.<br />Flora, one of Theresa's charges, has an artist dad who even at the age of seventy drinks like a fish and has an eye for pretty women. Theresa finds his attentions flattering and ultimately gives in to his charms.<br />In some of the most beautiful scenes in the book, McDermott paints the relationship between Theresa and her cousin \\"Daisy Mae\\" with heart-breaking tenderness. Both girls are privy to a secret but letting the grownups know will only \\"spoil the summer.\\" Instead, Daisy Mae and her precocious cousin spend some rare precious moments together. Daisy for one, knows it is never going to happen again.<br />Running deep throughout the novel and serving almost to distract from (instead of add to) the story is the overwhelming presence of parental neglect. Almost all through the book, every child (and there are many of them) survives without parents. Even little toddler Flora is eternally perched outside waiting for her sitter with a bottle of punch cradled in her chubby palms. Her mom has walked out and her old father has no intentions of caring for her even if he knew how. <br />This parental neglect cuts across all lines. Flora the child of a rich artist, is as much a victim of it as the Moran kids, Theresa's next door poorer neighbors.<br />McDermott in her beautiful book makes us witness all the heartbreak and losses in crisp, precise prose. Her fifteen year old heroine is strong and wise both because of the pain and in spite of it.	2003-01-10

Going with the Grain is a bread lover's delight. The book is not about recipes although there are a few scattered here and there. Instead, Seligson uses bread as a quirky tour guide to take us all around the world. &quot;In Arabic, the word for bread and life is the same, aysh&quot; Seligson explains.<br />Going with the Grain takes us to Morocco, Saratoga Springs, NY, India, Ireland and many more places. The common thread running through all these travelogues is of course the bread Seligson seeks out in each adventure. Often times even the bread is only an incidental player in her travel tales (bread recipes it seems are a closely guarded secret in many places). Never mind. We warm up to Seligson's descriptions anyway and watch her chat away with the locals enviously.<br />Seligson is sometimes a little too eager to point out that she is not another shutter-happy tourist. While she disdains fellow Americans who drops names at the slightest excuse, she refers to herself as a &quot;self-respecting subscriber of the New York Review of Books.&quot; Her language sometimes tries too hard to be funny. Sentences such as: &quot;He can feel your pain&quot; (get it!?) serve mostly just to annoy. I also felt that the narrative could have been well supplemented with the inclusion of photographs. It would have been nice for example to see pictures of the Pueblo horno ovens or the Ballymaloe in Ireland.<br />Despite these points, Seligson comes across as a warm person with a genuine interest in lives lived all around the world. I also appreciated the segments on the Wonder Bread factory and the army bread project in Natick, Massachusetts, aspects of bread not everyone would have spent the time researching.<br />Going with the Grain is a delicious romp all over the world. Be it a baguette, soda bread, matzo, or roti, Seligson proves that the stuff made with flour and water is but one more thing that the peoples of the world share.	2002-12-30

Bates has done a brilliant job here in describing the closeted lives of the Chinese communities living in and around Ontario. Her short stories tackle ground that will seem familiar to many immigrants. Marriage outside the community to a lo fon (non-Chinese Canadian), aging elders and their place in an increasingly rushed life, the relevance of superstitions in modern-day life-these are but some of the issues addressed in Bates' collection.<br />In \\"The Lucky Wedding\\", the protagonist, Sandra, has to break the news of her wedding to a lo fon, to her family. Sandra can do nothing right it seems. She has chosen Victor, whose \\"livelihood was suspiciously unreliable. He was an artist, a painter, someone who worked with his hands, like a laborer.\\" In addition, Sandra makes out reception invitations on cards with just one bird on the front-a definite ill omen for the Chinese. The fine line that Sandra has to tread between the Chinese and mainstream Canadian worlds is done very well here.<br />The immigrants lead extremely claustrophobic lives. In \\"The Good Luck Café\\" for example, a newly wed Chinese wife talks to nobody but her husband and brother-in-law all day long. Despite this, many of the characters in Bates' stories worry that they or their offspring are becoming \\"too Canadian.\\" \\"Our lives in Canada are overrun by gwei, ghosts\\", is a strong complaint, \\"gwei men, gwei women, gwei children. We served food to gwei customers, bought from gwei shopkeepers, were treated by gwei doctors and taught by gwei teachers.\\" <br />Bates' stories are a compassionate look at people still very much on the fringes of mainstream Canadian society. Theirs is a world where cultures collide, where the old meets the new, and something has togive. China Dog is an incisive look at the immigrant experience up close. Its insights are valuable to us all.	2002-12-09

This is not \\"writing from around the world.\\" There is also a lot of coverage devoted to MFK Fisher.

These were its assets: a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, and an old typewriter.&quot; So begins Alexander McCall Smith's charming novel, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br />Precious Ramotswe grew up in Botswana, an African country that has known relative peace compared to its more unlucky neighbors. When her father dies after a hard life as a miner, Precious inherits a decent sum of money left her by him. Mma Ramotswe invests it all in a rather unusual business-a detective agency proudly named &quot;The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency.&quot;<br />Business is brisk for Mma Ramotswe and she gets right down to it with a trusty &quot;detective manual&quot; by her side. In real life, however, it is not simply bookish knowledge that matters. Ramotswe is a special combination of resource, intelligence, and will. She solves her cases with ample common sense and bravery.<br />Smith's novel, set in the Africa of the 90's, is no hard-boiled thriller. Instead most of Ramotswe's cases depict the many foibles of the human character-cheating husbands, insurance scams and even distrustful fathers. The book's language is wonderfully simple and direct. The individual &quot;mysteries&quot; are good stand-alone short stories in their own right.<br />Interspersed amongst them are pictures of a beautiful country, Botswana, and the quiet grace of its people. Mma Ramotswe's everyday interactions with her fellow citizens are captured wonderfully. Ramotswe meets life with smart sensibilities and a wry sense of humor. She is comfortable in her ample frame (a size 22) and proud of her Africa. She &quot;did not want Africa to change. She did not want her people to become like everybody else, soulless, selfish, forgetful of what it means to be an African, or, worse still, ashamed of Africa.&quot;<br />In a crazed rushed world, Mma Ramotswe stands for everything right about a less frenetic paceof life. In her, McCall Smith has created a perfect embodiment of Africa. Mr. Smith, who has enjoyed some schooling in Zimbabwe but is a Scot himself, has done a great job both in portraying Botswana and in creating a beautiful portrait of a strong woman. I enjoyed the trip immensely. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is just the right book for a lazy weekend afternoon. I especially recommend it with a side of Mma Ramotswe's favorite drink, a steaming cup of redbush tea!	2002-12-05

Dr. Gawande is a staff writer for the magazine and he writes about issues he can deeply relate to-the science and complexities of medicine. Complications: A Surgeon's Notes On An Imperfect Science is a compilation of many of Gawande's essays, a few of which have appeared before in the New Yorker. Many of the essays, however, are new.<br />It is immediately apparent upon reading the book what an extremely humble person Dr. Gawande is. Even as a resident surgeon in a prestigious hospital in Boston, he retains a special capacity to see the human side of the person laid out on the operating table. Dr. Gawande is able to distance himself from his profession and analyze its faults and shortcomings (including his own).<br />Complications, nominated for the National Book Award this year, is divided into three categories. In the first, Dr. Gawande focuses on the fallibility of surgeons. In one of the most honest statements in the book (and there are many!) he says, \\"Medicine is, I have found, a strange and in many ways disturbing business. The stakes are high, the liberties taken tremendous. We drug people, put needles and tubes into them, manipulate their chemistry, biology, and physics, lay them unconscious and open their bodies up to the world. We do so out of an abiding confidence in our know-how as a profession. What you find when you get in close, however-close enough to see the furrowed brows, the doubts and missteps, the failures as well as the successes-is how messy, uncertain, and also how surprising medicine turns out to be.\\" Surgeons, it turns out, are only human, and they do make mistakes on the job. All have to learn on the operating floor. It is a fine line between learning and the betterment of all patients with no harm caused.<br />The second part of Complications deals with the mysteries surrounding some of the most common of physical ailments-pain, blushing, obesity, morning sickness to name a few. It is in these pages that I was struck by how keen Dr. Gawande is to keep track of his patients. He continues to be in their lives long after the surgery has been done.<br />Dr. Gawande addresses the uncertainties that plague medical decisions in the last part of his book. How much rights do patients have when the doctor knows \\"what is good for them\\". The book features a brilliant discussion of patient autonomy. \\"The new orthodoxy about patient autonomy has a hard time acknowledging an awkward truth: patients frequently don't want the freedom that we've given them. That is, they're glad to have their autonomy respected, but the exercise of that autonomy means being able to relinquish it.\\" In one of many personal examples in the book, the author himself admits to letting his doctors decide how to care for his premature baby when she was gasping for breath. Sometimes laying the entire decision burden of patient care on the patient can be too emotionally exhausting.<br />Apart from Dr. Gawande's precise writing (the book reads like a thriller!), I was struck by his strong feelings for the socio-economic underprivileged. He does not neglect to make the case that in a medical setting where learning needs to be done it is often at the expense of the underprivileged or the uninformed. The doctor's child gets special treatment, but the truck driver's child doesn't.<br />Complications is the kind of wonderful book that makes me feel better prepared the next time I or one of my own is lined up on the operating table. I have been given a view into how the system works. I know I can keep myself informed and hope for the best. If I am lucky, my surgeon will be like Dr. Atul Gawande, capable, sincere, and a person who knows how to \\"preserve kindness.\\"	2002-11-16

Frank Cassidy is a guy whose station in life is defined by a dead-end job at the near bottom of the socioeconomic ladder. He is mired in an unhappy life with a wife, Honey, and two kids, Robert Lee and Ernie. <br />Frank has suffered terrible trauma as a child. He has witnessed his parents burning to death in a fire thirty years ago and the scars from the incident run deep. \\"The way I saw it in life, there were only two states,\\" Frank explains, \\"either you're trying to recapture the past or trying to escape the past.\\" When Frank learns from a newspaper that his uncle is dead, that past comes chasing after him. Frank decides to leave his job and life in New Jersey and move his family up north to Michigan to (if nothing else), lay some claims on the family farm. Desperately poor, Frank manages to ferry his family to Michigan using a series of stolen cars. <br />Once in small town Michigan, Frank discovers that explaining the past might not come easy, especially when there are so many unanswered questions. His uncle has been shot, but by whom? The alleged killer hangs himself and lies in a state of permanent coma. What was the killer's (The Sleeper's) motive? Why is Norman, Frank's brother, slowly losing his mind? To answer these, Frank must exercise his own demons and confront some tough answers. <br />Frank's wife, Honey, in the meantime, has issues of her own. Her ex-husband, Ken, is on death row. She and his son Robert Lee try to cope with the impending loss in ways unique to their respective personalities. <br />Collins has set The Resurrectionists in the America of the late seventies. The Watergate hearings and Skylab form essential background here. Frank and his family spend most of their waking hours watching endless reruns on television. The reruns serve as an excellent metaphor of the cultural stasis of American life in those times. <br />At a broader level, the novel hints at Biblical overtones set in very contemporary settings. Frank of course, is a \\"resurrectionist\\" coming back to take control of his past. \\"There was something prophetic about all of it,\\" Frank says when he drives back to Michigan from New Jersey. \\"Like beginning a journey across the river Styx to the land of the dead, a journey back to the center of things, to secrets I had not let myself think about in years.\\" <br />Collins is a master at painting pictures of small town American life-the diners, a snowbound campus, even a highway rest stop at McDonalds. The images are searing. <br />Apart from the wonderful storyline, the one mighty plus for The Resurrectionists is Collins's absolutely brilliant pacing of the plot. The book is wonderfully engrossing and surprises are thrown at you right until the breathtaking end. The Resurrectionists might be called a mystery novel, but it really is so much more than that. It is a book that will hold your attention right till the very last page.	2002-11-01

Having just suffered a stroke, he is given to frequent rants, many pieces of which hint at a wretched life lived. His faithful graduate student and soon-to-be son-in-law Jian Wan is assigned by the university to attend to the professor's daily needs. In the sparse hospital room, he cannot help listening in on the rants. As he does, Wan tries to understand the deep sense of loss that his professor has suffered. It is later evident to the young graduate student that the professor has had to deal with much personal pain and a fruitless existence. \\"Every intellectual is a clerk in China\\", Professor Yang raves, \\"just a clerk, a screw in the machine of the revolution.\\" The professor's unfortunate life eventually changes the course of at least three others. <br />Jian Wan himself is desperately trying to hold it all together-caring for his professor while his PhD qualifying exams loom around the corner. The fate of these exams will determine whether or not he can make it to Beijing to be with his ambitious fiancée, Meimei (Yang's daughter). At first, Jian Wan assumes he has no other choice than follow the scholarly course that has been charted for him. However, Yang's endless rants about the meaningless existence of a scholar, along with a transformative trip to the countryside, point him in another way. \\"As a human being, I should spend my life in such a way that at the final hour I could feel fulfillment and contentment, as if I had completed a task or a journey.\\" Jian Wan says. He no longer wants to pretend to be a scholar, but live instead, a truly productive life. As Jian Wan tries to find a way out, he realizes he is powerless in a society that crushes all dissent. The final pages of The Crazed find Wan in the midst of the cathartic events of Tiananmen Square.<br />Ha Jin's sparse writing style, which was on wonderful display in \\"Waiting\\", is as effective as ever. His words are as clinical and precise as the hospital room in which much of the novel is set. The pace moves forward rapidly and well. Sometimes, I found that the professor's rants covered a lot of space in the text prolonging the suspense a bit too much. These sections set in the hospital with an almost unrelenting focus on the professor were a little claustrophobic. <br />Despite these small distractions, the main story comes through loud and clear in Ha Jin's wonderful book. The machinations of a government that can manipulate the smallest events in its citizens' lives are on awful display here. Jian Wan in the novel sees an image of China: \\"in the form of an old hag so decrepit and brainsick that she would devour her children to sustain herself.\\" <br />In such a society, one wonders, who cannot help but be \\"crazed\\".	2002-10-25

The stories also lend themselves well to the read-aloud format for younger children. Many of my old favorites are here including the ones about how Ganesha got his elephant head and about how he made a \\"pradakshina\\" around his parents, into a trip around the world. Some might find the versions of certain stories here to be different from what they know. That is understandable considering how many of these have been passed along strictly through oral tradition. There are also some rarer stories here including one borrowed from Buddhist folklore.<br />Krishnaswami has done a thorough professional job with this one. She has prefaced the book with a brief introduction to Hindu mythology and to the god Ganesha himself. Also complementing the stories are a glossary of terms, a list of characters (kids would appreciate that!), a list of other names for Ganesha, and a pronunciation guide.<br />Krishnaswami finishes every story she narrates with a line or two that ties the legend to modern day reality.  For example, after the story about Ganesha's head, Krishnaswami explains that in Indian (especially South Indian) temples today, sometimes elephants are fed and maintained reverentially.  These acts, Krishnaswami explains, probably acknowledge the sacrifice made by the elephant in the original story. Small explanations like these place the stories in context, a service that I think is especially useful. The last word belongs to the wonderful old-world illustrations by Maniam Selven that complement the stories wonderfully.<br />With this book, Krishnaswami demonstrates that she is not only a gifted storyteller, she is also a thorough one. The Broken Tusk will get an enthusiastic nod not only from the young reading set but also from their grateful parents. This book is as charming as the elephant god himself!	2002-10-22

Combine that with tales set in India, and it gets better. <br />Shower of Gold features Krishnaswami again showcasing her wonderful storytelling talent. Like her earlier book, Broken Tusk, this one too picks up a niche topic and tells stories about it. All of the stories in Shower of Gold are about courageous women or devis (goddesses) who have to overcome terrible odds to emerge triumphant. The stories also serve as a wonderful study in Indian culture. The dire conditions of some of these women though, may be startling to some little ones. Stories such as Rani of Jhansi are borrowed from history texts, while others such as the story of Savitri or Sita are from mythology.<br />Adults will especially appreciate the notes at the end of each story that often includes pointers to more exhaustive readings on the subject. <br />The larger question of course, looms here. \\"Some people wonder why, when goddesses in Hindu mythology play such magical and powerful roles, Hindu society has not given women more power.\\" The author does hint at reasons but a more potent explanation is not really within the scope of this book. To her credit, Krishnaswami sticks to her agenda and delivers.<br />Shower of Gold is a fresh look at the clichéd phrase, \\"girl power\\".  For here are some bold strong girls and women who have effectively shown what it all means.	2002-10-22

Gault inadvertently hurts a boy's shoulder in the process. He is deeply remorseful and tries to make peace with the boy's family, with little success. Gault and his strong wife Heloise decide they must leave Lahardane, their wonderful home, in order to avoid future trouble. Daughter Lucy will not hear of it. She loves Lahardane, she loves the water, the sand, the abandoned dog by the strand. To convince her parents to stay, Lucy decides to run away from home. Following a series of tragic misunderstandings, Lucy is presumed dead. Her parents, no longer having an anchor that ties them to Lahardane, finally leave. In doing so, they inadvertently abandon Lucy and transfer her care to the house-servants Bridget and Henry. <br />As the years pass, Lucy continues to exist and float along waiting forever, for forgiveness that takes its sweet time coming. Trevor's novel deals with fleeing both in the figurative and literal sense. \\"It is our tragedy in Ireland that for one reason or another we are repeatedly obliged to flee from what we hold dear.\\" says Trevor. The Gaults flee from memories, they travel all over Europe and \\"set out upon a pilgrimage, absolution sought for sins that varied in the telling.\\" Lucy at the same time is tormented by one question. \\"How could I have run away from them?\\" she asks. The anguish that tears her apart makes her run from life, even reject love when she finds it. <br />William Trevor is a masterful writer of short stories-many of his have been published in the New Yorker. In this novel, he expertly paints a strong gripping story with just a few intense scenes. Almost every sentence in here does the job of twenty. In the end, when melodrama could easily have taken over, the silence between a now grown Lucy and her returned father is heartbreaking and real. \\"Say something\\", you want to yell at them as you drink in theanguish.<br />The Story of Lucy Gault is an understated marvel. In the end, Trevor writes: \\"Calamity shaped a life when, long ago, chance was so cruel. Calamity shapes the story that is told, and is the reason for its being.\\" Calamity might have been the trigger for this story, but oh, what a story, and oh what a telling!	2002-10-17

Ziada is bothered enough with suspicion about this that he warns the locals that \\"we should expect a great disaster in our city sometime soon.\\" <br />Ziada's focus of supsicion turns out to be some harmless tinkering by an inventor Mahfoudh Lemdjad. Lemdjad has developed a new kind of loom and is looking to patent it and show the tool in the world fair. The invention however, is not well received at the local government offices. Lemdjad is told off summarily by a bureaucrat: \\"Surely you know that in our sacred religion the words creation and invention are sometimes condemned because they are perceived as heresy.\\" The obstacles that Lemdjad has to face just to get the most basic of tasks done portray only all too realistically the corruptions of a sick society. When Lemdjad finally does it all and even \\"creates a sensation at the Inventors' fair in Heidelberg\\", he finds his fortunes reversed. <br />Unfortunately so does Menouar Ziada. <br />To reveal more would be giving too much of the plot away. Djaout weaves a wonderful tale with plenty of atmosphere and a slight undercurrent of tension. The language is very rich and evocative. I found though that much of the slim novel required careful reading because it had too many long sentences. Despite this minor drawback, The Watchers is wonderful storytelling.<br />The story, written more than ten years ago, is especially relevant in these times when even our most basic of human rights are under threat of being compromised. Djaout's voice continues to speak loud and clear even after he has been silenced-a triumph of the pen over the sword.	2002-10-14

He describes with clarity the utter chaos at the site and the noisy democracy that prevailed and that allowed a small organization called the DDC (Department of Design and Construction) to direct recovery efforts. He also details the personality clashes between the different factions at the site-an inevitable result of working under extreme, trying conditions.<br />Langewiesche's descriptions of the ruins (along with the wonderful pictures) are chilling: &quot;Most of the rooms (of the Deutsche Bank dining area) had been unoccupied at the time of the attack, and were set for lunch-with fresh place mats, plates, and utensils, and sets of stemmed glasses, some of which had been capsized and broken by the pressure waves and lay now as they had fallen, like everything else here, under a feathery gauze of the Twin Towers' remains.&quot; His account of the last minutes of American Airlines Flight 11 and its last conversations with an air-traffic controller in Boston Center are eerie and scary.<br />The book describes the recovery effort and all the personalities who made it happen, wonderfully. I found myself admiring the soft-spoken demolition expert from North Carolina, David Griffin who, true to the American method, just showed up at the site, proved his merit, and got the job.<br />I was comforted in a strange sort of way to read that most of the steel recovered from the WTC site was sold as scrap and trucked away to countries such as China, who would put the steel to good use and recycle it. As Langewiesche puts it, &quot;It was a strangely appropriate fate for these buildings, named for just this sort of trade.&quot;<br />In the end, 1.5 million tons of debris was hauled away from the World Trade Center site. The scale alone is daunting enough. That the recovery effort was carried out efficiently and with respect for the dead, is a triumph in an otherwise trying time. Langewiesche's book pays well-deserved homage to the people and the institutions that made it happen.	2002-10-04
US	52924710	R21YAQBFGXFHE1	0679435549	101928054	Caramelo	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Beautiful, occasionally syrupy narrative	Caramelo is a multi-generational tale of the Keyes family as related by Lala or Celaya, the \\"favorite child of a favorite child\\". Lala weaves together stories about her family's past, and tries in the process, to find a place for herself in the picture. There is Awful Grandmother, who we know, really was a sweet, tortured Soledad as a child. Then there is Uncle Fat-Face, Aunty Light-Skin amongst others, all of whom have wonderful stories to tell. Caramelo starts off with a family vacation the Reyes family is taking to Mexico. Long ago, the Reyes brothers moved to Chicago from Mexico to try their fortunes in the upholstery business. This \\"vacation\\" is more of a religious duty than anything else. Lala complains, \\"All year the apartment looks like a store. A year's worth of collecting merchandise for the trip South.\\" The trip this time, ends with a hint at a family secret which is revealed only much later in the book.<br />Cisneros traces Lela's family's past systematically through most of its members and ultimately arrives upon Lala's own search for an identity in a new \\"home\\". Cisneros's language is beautiful and earthy, and there is a fair amount of Spanish thrown in.<br />Like most \\"emigrants caught between here and there\\", Lala is an expert spectator when she visits Mexico: \\"Toc, says the light switch in this country, at home it says click. Honk, say the cars at home, here they say tan-tan-tan.\\" I find that Lala wears rosy glasses when she views Mexico. Of course, this is only to be expected, as Lala explains, \\"Every year I cross the border, it's the same-my mind forgets. But my body always remembers.\\" The slight detraction that emerges though is that very often Lala tends to overly romanticize the past. Her characters are loud, earthy, wonderful, caring, human beings but sometimes that can be too much of a good thing.<br />In a footnote (one of many) in the book, Cisneros argues that a Mexican soap opera or telenovela is not really bad storytelling-\\"it is a storythat has tried to emulate Mexican life.\\" The telenovela, Cisneros explains, is storytelling at its best, since \\"it has the power of a true Scheherazade-it keeps you coming back for more.\\" I would then apply the same definiton to Caramelo. The narrative might be a bit syrupy, but you will come back for more.<br />The Caramelo in the novel's title refers to the intricate caramel-colored, striped rebozo (silk shawl) that Lala has claimed for her own from her grandmother. This particular rebozo, like most others, has intricate knotted fringes, but there is a part that is left unfinished. As we read the novel, we realize how very much like the Caramelo rebozo, the Reyes family is-a family with lives strongly interconnected, yet with a bit of unfinished fringe at the end.	2002-10-01

Born a Serbian, he came to the US as part of a journalistic goodwill mission and stayed behind when his land broke into war. He learnt English soon thereafter and in a few years, wrote the superlative \\"The Question of Bruno\\"-a compilation of short stories that earned him high praise in every literary circuit imaginable.<br />Jozef Pronek from \\"Bruno\\", is the \\"Nowhere Man\\" of the book's title and his chronicles as a displaced world citizen are told at various points, through the lenses of people who know him. We learn that Pronek had a pretty unremarkable childhood shielded in part by a stern and watchful grandmother. His teenage years are nothing very specatacular either, spent in most part belting out Beatles tunes (Nowhere Man, get it?!) as part of a band called Blind Jozef Pronek and Dead Souls. Pronek also ventures to Ukraine as a graduate student to learn more about his father's ancestry. This part of the narrative is described by an American fellow graduate student, Victor Plavchuck. Victor harbors a secret crush on Pronek, somebody who, in his words, \\"had the ability to respond and speak to the world.\\" At the end, we find Jozef Pronek trying to fit into Midwestern suburbia, making a living as a Greenpeace canvasser.<br />Like his earlier book, Nowhere Man is a great vehicle that showcases Hemon's wonderful use of language. One description particularly rings in my mind: \\"I piled different sorts of blebby pierogi and a cup of limpid tea on my tray.\\" Blebby? I looked it up. Blebby: \\"A small blister or sometimes a small particle\\", a description that would work perfectly for pierogi!<br />Despite the brilliant use of language, Hemon's narrative moves too much out of focus back and forth and sometimes leaves large gaps in between. Hemon tries to explain this in the novel by saying, \\"The hard part in writing a narrative of someone's life is choosing from the abundance of details and microevents, all of them equally significant, or equally insignifincant.\\" That may be so but the story (inlcuding the bizarre last chapter) leaves too much unsaid. The narrative is well, blebby!<br />The greatest strength of Nowhere Man is Hemon's ability to describe the restlessness that comes from forced exile. To that end, the Greenpeace chapter set in Chicago is my favorite. Pronek simply exists and the routine everydayness of his life is enough to drive him crazy. He is desperately searching out a place in a new role and a new life. When asked if he is a Serb or a Muslim, Pronek simply replies, \\"I am complicated.\\"<br />In Chicago, Pronek and his girlfriend once try to kill a small mouse. The tiny animal just never quits. Finally Pronek puts it in a small pail of water and he notices that \\"the mouse was scratching the walls with its claws, trying to climb up, but it was clearly hopeless.\\" That mouse in Hemon's hands, could well be Jozef Pronek--a displaced animal desperately trying to make his way out. Not succeeding, but not entirely failing either.	2002-09-25

She has been in exile ever since her controversial book \\"Lajja\\" or \\"Shame\\" about Muslim persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh caused a fatwa to be issued against her. Meyebela, My Bengali Girlhood: A Memoir of Growing up Female in a Muslim World is Nasrins heart-wrenching account of a desperate childhood in Mymensingh, a relatively small town in Bangladesh.<br />In this memoir (one of two volumes), Nasrin openly questions her religion, Islam, and its discrimination against women. Her sad and depressing childhood was an unfortunate byproduct of a unique combination of cruel elements, one of which was a repressive society where \\"I was simply supposed to acceptwithout asking questionswhatever the grownups decided to bestow on me, be it punishment or reward.\\" Taslima was treated like a second-class citizen all throughout and horrifically abused by her uncles. Add to these, Nasrin had very unstable parentsa mother who was driven to religious extremism by a philandering father and a father who was extremely harsh yet very insistent on education. Having had his first two sons fail his \\"expectations\\", he pinned all his hopes on young Taslima and her sister, Yasmin. The girls were denied all social interaction (Nasrins father had high walls built around the house so the girls could not look beyond it and get distracted) and the books were made to be their only focus.<br />Nasrins memoir, which is set against the Bangladesh war for independence, makes some very important points about religion and a girls role in an oppressive society. Like a flood of memories though, her memoir seems to shift out of focus occasionally. Towards the end, parts of her statements get to be repetitive.<br />Taslima Nasrin did become a doctor and lived up to her fathers expectations. In that sense, he \\"won\\". But eventually Nasrin did manage to find her own voice-- one that continues to speak powerfully on behalf of oppressed women all over the world.<br />Nasrin in her memoir tells us what life truly is like for many girls around the world. It is our duty to listen. It is sad though that we can often do little more than be outraged.	2002-09-21
US	52924710	R3HZBT69HUOF6B	0375403736	564250926	Family Matters	Books	5	52	58	N	N	A flawless gem	Mistry's latest novel, Family Matters, is a flawless gem and is a worthy successor to his equally impressive A Fine Balance. At the heart of Family Matters is the aging Nariman Vakeel who is in rapidly deteroriating health due to Parkinson's. Nariman is haunted by dreams of his ex-girlfriend, Lucy Braganza, a girl his parents forced him to renounce. He is cared for by his children Coomy and Jal. Coomy is a cranky woman with \\"too much anger\\" within her to care for her father well. When Nariman slips and hurts himself seriously on a walk, Coomy and Jal transfer custody of their bedridden father to their half-sister, Roxana Chenoy. Roxana's is a happy family with a doting husband, Yezad, and two wonderful sons, Murad and Jehangir. The arrival of Nariman in an already cramped apartment, though, puts enormous financial and emotional burdens on the family. As Nariman puts it, \\"People have their own lives, it's not helpful when something disturbs those lives.\\" Family Matters portrays the daily play of emotions with remarkable acuity.<br />Mistry paints all of his characters very realistically with real strengths and failings. Roxana cares for her aging father with amazing grace. Yezad, who once dreamt of emigrating to Canada, tries valiantly to keep the cheer. And who wouldn't want to have Murad and Jehangir, two of the most amazing kids, as their own! There are many side players in the story-Daisy, who lives downstairs in Pleasant Villa, and who regales Nariman quite often with her violin. Also portrayed well is Mr. Vikram Kapur, Yezad's boss at Bombay Sporting Goods Emporium.<br />Mistry's love for his old city, Bombay, shines through loud and clear in the words of Mr. Kapur: \\"Bombay endures because it gives and it receives. Within this warp and weft is woven the special texture of its social fabric, the spirit of tolerance, acceptance, generosity. Anywhere else in the world, in those so-called civilized places like England and America, such terrible conditions would lead to revolution.\\" <br />These words of high praise for Bombay, however, come with a warning against the radical political party, Shiv Sena, trying to gain control of the dynamic city. As with Fine Balance, Mistry uses his platform to make a couple of political statements-a frequent rant against the Shiv Sena and another subtle one against the pro-lifers in America, the \\"empty talkers\\" who prevent research into Parkinson's. <br />Mistry warns against fatalism: \\"In a culture where destiny is embraced as the paramount force, we are all puppets.\\" Despite that, his primary characters often accept fate as the only graceful alternative. Family Matters ends without strong closure and that is just as well. For we have learnt along the way that even in a culture riddled with fatalists, the common man holds his head up high and always emerges from battle, relatively unscathed. <br />At one point in the narrative, Yezad and his boss peer into a mirror and Mr.Kapur asks, \\"See that? The faces of ordinary family men, not heroes.\\" I respectfully beg to differ.	2002-09-17

Within the pages of this (all too) slim volume, he perfectly captures many small samples of Indian middle class life. Most of the stories are not really so in the classical sense. Instead they are essentially snapshots from various parts of life all framed in &quot;real time&quot;.<br />I loved all the vignettes very much. Amit Chaudhuri is very gifted at describing subtle facets of everyday life that might escape the rest of us. His descriptions of apartments either in Calcutta (adorned with white curtains with printed flowers) or Bombay are accurate enough to induce a warm sense of nostalgia.<br />My favorite stories in the collection are: &quot;The Man from Khurda District&quot; and &quot;Beyond Translation.&quot; The former is a simply told story of a chowkidar and his life that revolves completely around his employer. Beyond Translation details the summer reading pastime that the author enjoyed along with his Bengali cousins.<br />Most of the people described in Chaudhuri's stories are solidly upper middle class if not downright rich. In a wonderfully fluid poem, E-Minor, at the end of the volume, the author informs us &quot;I disowned our Mercedes-Benz, took the 106 bus, but remained unable to solve my lack of want.&quot;<br />Real Time demonstrates very ably, how good Amit Chaudhuri is at portraying a slice of Indian society that, in my opinion, is not adequately represented in modern Indian fiction.	2002-09-14
US	52924710	R3751T0VWQDT9L	0375507876	530438268	Prague: A Novel	Books	4	30	33	N	Y	A bit too clever?	In a starred review, Publishers Weekly praised Prague as one of the most dazzling debuts of the year. When I started Prague, I was floored by Phillip's exquisite writing and by the evocative atmosphere of Budapest (no, not Prague) he so expertly weaves into his book.<br />Gradually however, the novel's ugly characters take up so much real estate that it becomes increasingly difficult to ignore them. Mark, Charles, Emily, and John are a bunch of American expatriates who have descended on Hungary in the early `90's just after the wall was torn down. All four are young and are trying vaguely to figure out the meaning of life in the Eastern bloc city. The characters are horribly self-absorbed and mean. While many have explained their self-absorption as a byproduct of their being a member of Generation X, I submit that it is probably also a product of their expat status. For all their outwardly aggressive behavior, Budapest is a foreign city to these people evidenced in the comfort they find from a person just come from America, \\"they crowded around him eager for news from home\\".<br />After I finished \\"Prague\\", I was very impressed by how well Phillips has portrayed his characters. So realistically in fact, that I was shaken by the worry that such obnoxious characters might indeed exist in real life. Charles hungrily swallows up an aging Hungarian native's (Imre Horvath) press and chalks it up to the ups and downs of capitalism. When John Price actually tries to bring genuine emotion to the front, he quickly dismisses it by admitting \\"he was ashamed to feel his throat tighten. He rubbed his eyes until the tickling sensation passed. His absurdity seemed to have no limits anymore\\". I personally am not an extremely emotional person, but the characters' rigid one-dimensional lives left me with a vague sense of dreariness.<br />Many have compared Phillip's writing style to that of Michael Chabon's (of Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay fame). Like Chabon, Phillips has amastery of the language that is a treat to read. The book dazzles you with gems like, \\"As she moved slightly to her music, she resembled an exotic species in an aquarium, a brightly colored swath of tattered material floating and swaying in her own private current\\". One of my two favorite parts of the book was a description of an old Hungarian restaurant that Imre Horvath takes his potential buyers to. The ordinariness of the restaurant means nothing to the newcomers, but nostalgia allows the restaurant to occupy a special place in Horvath's heart. My other favorite was the description of the Horvath press and its owners over many generations. After reading all that, I was only more upset at how casually the press finally got sucked up by capitalism, the act being an ultimate cliché. While Phillips admits to using clichés in the book, their use probably liberated him enough to paint his characters and settings so painstakingly well.<br />Read Prague for the atmosphere and the wonderful writing, but steel yourself to meet characters you will love to hate.	2002-09-14

All of his works are very concise and &quot;Cheese&quot; is no different.<br />Within a mere 126 pages, Elsschot humorously recounts the tale of Frans Laarmans, an ordinary clerk, who tries his hand vainly at the cheese business. Laarmans is a clerk with General Marine and Shipbuilding Company and is quite content to plod along until a friend prods him to delve into the cheese business. What follows is a wonderfully wry and funny look at business. Larmaans is quite unsure about what to do when ten thousand wheels of the red-rinded Edam cheeses arrive at his doorstep. He knows he has to sell them all, but would rather first set up his office with a proper desk and typewriter. In the end, his business collapses predictably, but Laarman's failure saddens the reader. One feels for the shy clerk right from the beginning to the end.<br />Elsschot had a wonderful gift for telling a story in just a few pages and &quot;Cheese&quot; is a wonderful example of it. I was tempted to read more by the author but sadly found out that most of the rest of his work is out of print. Special thanks then to Granta Books for republishing this one.<br />Other pluses for the book are the bright red jacket, the price, and the crisp writing style. I finished the book in one sitting at the beach.<br />&quot;Cheese&quot; is just as delectable as the full-cream Edams featured in it. Dig in!	2002-09-14

Not much emotion rises to the surface, but Jayojit does mull over what went wrong with his marriage. His dad, the Admiral, meanwhile is busy leading a retired life complaining about the shoddy performance of banks and going out for his morning constitutionals. Joy's mother fusses over him and his son, frying \\"luchis\\" for breakfast and insisting that they eat them.<br />Chaudhuri does an absolutely brilliant job of describing the smallest of Indian transactions, such as a taxi ride or even business at the local bank. His sparse details of Jayojit's return to the US at the end of the summer, is heart-tuggingly accurate. In fact, this is the book that would tug at all kinds of strings for Indians across the diaspora. Chaudhuri's portraits of Jayojit's strained interactions with an environment at once familiar and strange to him are wonderful and something I could completely identify with. Also right on are the son, Bonny's, observations and comments about life around him. \\"Baba, what does \\"Kwality\\" mean?\\" he asks when he sees a van bearing the name on the streets. When his father explains that it is an ice cream truck, Bonny \\"lifts his chin from the (taxi) seat, and exclaims, \\"Ice cream?\\" as if, like doughnuts, ice cream was too outrageous to mention here.\\"<br />While I loved all of Chaudhuri's precise details immensely (probably because of nostalgia stirred), occasionally his poetic descriptions of even the most basic of events started grating: \\"The sun dimmed, as if it had been snuffed out, and then kindled again as a cloud moved past.\\"<br />I strongly believe that Amit Chaudhuri is a very gifted writer. His eye for precision is amazing. If he tightens his storylines, Chaudhuri will get a taste of an even bigger audience--something he most definitely deserves.	2002-09-14

The book traces the lives of three generations of Dorais as they try to find their place in the world. Solomon Dorai, the patriarch of the family, must strive hard to keep his town, Chevathar, from erupting into violence as a result of caste disputes. Ultimately, Solomon falls victim to this very evil. Of Solomons two sons, Aaron is a hothead whose primary claim to fame is the successful clearing ( in high-jump) of a massive well in Chevathar. The other son, Daniel, is much more worldly-wise and takes care of his family after a successful stint as \\"vaidyan\\" (doctor). Daniels son, Kannan, chooses to move away from Chevathar and seek his fortunes in the white mans (read occupiers, the British) tea estates. We see changes that afflict the Dorai clan -- assimilation into foreign cultures and even a \\"love\\" marriage in this generation. Finally we learn that even if your average Dorai strays far from Chevathar, he magically hears the call and always comes back \\"home\\". Yawn!<br />The biggest problem with Blue Mangoes is that the story is so mediocre. In a recent interview, Mr. Davidar mentioned how he wanted to write about all his childhood memories played out in South India. I wish he had stuck to that agenda and written a wonderful memoir of sorts. Instead, what he has done is tried to create a filler story around all his memories. And that is always a dangerous game to play. Whats worse, Davidar has tried to create a \\"saga\\" which means he throws everything but the kitchen sink in. Youve got caste, caste, and more caste. Youve got dowry, youve got oppressive husbands, subservient wives, man-eating tigers, the works. Davidar tries hard to create a panoramic effect but in the end, the book rambles too much. He needs a better editor. Another hindrance that many readers might find annoying is Davidars generous use of Tamil words with no translation or lexicon included.<br />The one saving grace of \\"House of Blue Mangoes\\" is that it is a masaledar, spicy read. It would make a good beach book. But I would borrow my copy from the library. Spend your money on better books.	2002-08-20

The next day, he and his hunting companion, Dr. Roscio, are found dead. There are no obvious suspects and no obvious motives. After a perfunctory investigation by the town marshal, the local Professor Laurana takes up the case only to have it all end badly.<br />The author, Leonardo Sciascia, is widely considered a prominent Sicilian author, a master who pretty much invented the form of the \\"metaphysical mystery\\". This dazzling page-turner is ample evidence of the master's craft. The book (as are all of Sciascia's works) is also a social commentary on Sicily with its culture of secrets and violence. When the pharmacist and doctor are done in, there is hardly much of a stir in the local populace. The marshal comes down from the county seat to briefly investigate the \\"big headache\\", speculations are tossed around and life goes on. The silence and nonchalance are chilling. <br />The New York Review of Books recently reprinted \\"To Each His Own\\" under its \\"classics\\" issues (and what a great service that is!). I am eager to read the rest of the talented Sciascia's works. A word of caution--the edition published by the New York Review of Books has a wonderful introduction to the novel in the beginning. Save this for after you have read the book. While the introduction is good, it gives too much of the plot away!<br />The final word must belong to the absolutely haunting painting on the book cover. Called \\"Night in Velate\\" and rendered by the Italian painter, Renato Guttuso, the picture is the perfect choice for the dark, wonderful book.<br />If you look closely enough, you can almost see the evil lurking and doing its thing under the cover of a deceptively beautiful Sicilian night.	2002-08-20

Marsha Ackermann, the author of this wonderful book, is a historian. She leads us on a wonderful historical tour of air-conditioning in America. Ackermann starts in the early `20's with a geographer, Ellsworth Huntington, who strongly believed that \\"people of European races (because of milder, temperate weather) are able to accomplish the most work and have the best health\\". His racist views, tempered by the more moderate ones of C.E.A.Winslow, a prominent public health professional, laid the groundwork for a societal shift in the acceptance of air-conditioning. <br />The Carrier Corporation, a major manufacturer of air-conditioning units, started off by plugging the units to luxury establishments such as hotels and movie \\"palaces\\". These beckoned the public with posters that promised that it was \\"Kool inside\\". <br />It was only as recently as the 50's (after the second world war), that air-conditioning made inroads in the home market. Advertisement appeals were made to women and later to men to a point where now the air-conditioning unit is ubiquitous in American society.<br />I was fascinated and alarmed to see how architectural features that provide relief from heat, such as \\"sleeping porches, sun parlors, and large windows\\" have been, over the years, thrown entirely away from the home development equation. Instead what we have most often are uniform houses that are easy to build and that have no \\"interior partitions that block the flow of conditioned air\\". <br />Even though Ackermann herself acknowledges in the end that she dislikes air-conditioning, her book is not a strident case for or against it. At times the book reads annoyingly like her thesis dissertation (with too much visual clutter from footnotes), but the endlessly fascinating topic keeps you glued.<br />I want to put in a special word for the absolutely charming pictures (many of them are photographs from the `50's) that Ackermann generously sprinkles throughout the book. They tell a wonderful storyall by themselves and supplement the text very well.<br />\\"Cool Comfort\\" expertly chronicles the history of air-conditioning in America. It is fascinating to read how sharp marketing and advertising, when the time is ripe, can turn a product from the luxury fringes to an item that is increasingly considered indispensable. In that sense, the lessons learned from this account can well be applied to almost any product society can now \\"never live without\\".	2002-08-03

A new focus of attention in the family and the family spins out of control! <br />A nice thing about the novel also, was the glimpses into  Miriam's mind and how possibly a kleptomaniac would work. <br />Overall a  fairly good read, but I wouldn't put it on the top of my summer reading  list.	2000-06-23

Every detail about the time and place in the novel is so beautifully drawn. A very compelling story and a very compelling narrative. I can't wait for Messud's next book!	1999-10-04
