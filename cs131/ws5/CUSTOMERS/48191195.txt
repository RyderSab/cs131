I was very impressed and am looking forward to reading her other books.<br />I was happy to see that Ms. Mason did not alone everyone in the book to live happily ever after but kept the book very realistic.<br />Even though this were members of a choir they each had their own situations to work through.  This book dealt with everything from murder to HIV.  You name it and it was in the book.<br />I am happy to say that I would recommend this book to anyone.<br />Well done Ms. Mason.	2002-07-08

One day I decided to go to the book store with my boyfriend and we decided to read a book together.  He chose Someone's in the Kitchen (this is the first book he has has ever read for pleasure) by Mr. Pete.  As he started to read the book it began to keep him interested and had him wanting to find out what happened in the end.  After hearing this from him I began to read it.<br />This is a very good book.  Once I started it I could not put it down, I read the book in two days while working sixteen to eighteen hours a day.  I would read the book at the red light.<br />Reggie was a player's player, he thought he had it all together.  Little did he realize every dog has it's day.  After Reggie had decided to make his mind up he could not stick with it.  I was happy to see Lila make a decision and stand by that decision.<br />Neal was the type of man any woman would want but his wife Shenita was not satisfied.  Shenita could not appreciate Neal for the man that he was and she got what she deserved in the end.<br />I was sorry to see that Reggie did not meet the addition to his family.<br />All in all this book was very good and realistic.  I would recommend this book to anyone.<br />Well done Mr. Pete.	2002-07-08

I really liked how Randy was very expressive and open with his feelings.  I was happy to see that they were both able to admit their faults in their marriage and try to work through it.  I am really looking forward to their next book.	2002-06-24

This book was totally different from anything has written in the past.  I was happy to see that Zane allowed the women in this novel to be involved in a monogamous relationship.  This was a refreshing considering the women in her other books.  I found this book to be a fast read.  I was happy to see that the women were strong and stood behind their beliefs, no matter what the cost.  I was elated that Janessa accepted her responsibilities and went on with her life with or without the help of Dvonte'.  It was good that Zane allowed Tempestt to have the happiness that she deserved.  Good work Zane and I am looking forward to your next novel.	2002-06-13

I was looking for Mr. Dickey to talk about the life of a hustler who found love and changed.  I did not expect the book to end as it did.  The ending was a total surprise for me.  I was happy to Mr. Dickey allowed Dante' to change for the better and finally do something for himself.  Dante' reminds of people that I encounter on a regular basis, they don't have a bad heart but they do what they need to do in order to survive.  All the trials and tribulations Dante' had experienced he still had a desire to go to college and achieve his goals.  I never would have thought that by Pam telling Dante' that saying about fraternities would make him want to pledge.  Well done Mr. Dickey.  I must say I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone.	2002-06-10

I read Hearts of Men and I cannot say that it stuck out in my mind.  Mr. Hunter has truly grown in his writing skills.  I was happy to see Terri had gotten enough of Genesis and stood behind what she said.  The last few pages of the book were phenomenal.  I did not expect it to end as it did.  I must say that I was very pleased with the ending.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  I wish I could give it more stars.  Thank you Mr. Hunter and I can't wait for your third novel.	2002-06-04

I did not like how one chapter would be about his professional life and then it would pick up with Pooquie in the following chapter.  I wish Mr. Hardy would have touched on Pooquie's reaction to not being able to catch up with Mitchell because he was with Montee.  I could not believe that Mr. Hardy allowed every man in the book to be gay and one bisexual.  This was not one of Mr. Hardy's best books but it was not one of his worse.	2002-05-29

It was a disappointment.  It wasn't the worse book that I have read but it was not the best.  I am the type of person, once I begin reading a book I don't stop until I am finish.  This is the only reason that I completed this book.  There were entirely too many typing errors.  Ms. Hunter did not do a very good job developing her characters in my opinion.  I also feel as though she left you hanging at the end.  This book was a little better than 2 stars but not better than three.	2002-05-24

I let this book sit on my shelf for about four or five months before I had a chance to read it.  I am sorry it sat there as long as it did.  Mrs. Murray's characters were so realistic.  I wish I could have given it more stars.  I must say again this book was DEFINITELY A JOY TO READ.	2002-04-05

I felt I had to review it as soon as possible.  The book is excellent.  Ms. Holmes covered every base possible.  The character Netta displayed an enormous amount of strength.  I enjoyed Ms. Holmes displaying Netta's emotions and allowing us to see that Netta could give and receive love.  Ms. Holmes did justice for every character in the book. This book reminds me of the saying &quot;The game is cold but it's fair.&quot;  I was glad that Netta was able to overcome her love for the game and move on with her life.  If you enjoyed &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot;, you will enjoy this as well.	2002-01-29

I continued to read in the hopes that William would realize that Andrea was playing him.  It is interesting to me that a man would go through some of the very same things that women go through.  I was impressed by the love William felt for Andrea.  It shows that men do bring old baggage into relationships.  I was very impressed with Mr. Cooper's novel and would recommend it to anyone.	2002-01-29

This book is a true example of the old saying, &quot;you never miss what you have until it's gone.&quot;  Ryan thought that he could speak to Ronda in a negative manner and she would accept it, I am glad Ronda realized she deserved better.  The author did an excellent job of explaining why Ronda did the things she did as a mother first and a woman second.  A lot of women would say I wouldn't take that off of him but you can never say what you would or wouldn't do, until you are in the situation.  I was glad that Ronda was strong enough to leave Ryan and not go back.  I am looking forward to a sequel. Ronda was indeed a srong woman.	2002-01-23
