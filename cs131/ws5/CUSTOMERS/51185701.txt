US	51185701	R9F2CZNJ7PFHE	0393323528	601624284	Next: The Future Just Happened	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Surfing the revolution	You can't, according to Michael Lewis, understand what is happening on the Internet, \\"unless you understand the conditions in the real world that led to what is happening on the Internet.\\" And you can't understand those unless you go there in person and have a look around.<br />In this book Lewis takes a look and reports on three startling teenagers. Markus Arnold, too young to drive, becomes the leading legal expert on askme.com. He answers up to a hundred questions a day on everything from legal rights, to murder to fraud. Fourteen year Daniel Sheldon from the North of England is too poor to take up a partial scholarship to a school for gifted children. In his quest for digital socialism, he spends his spare time networking around the world to develop peer-to-peer file sharing systems, successors of copyright breaking programmes such as Napstar. <br />And Jonathan Lebed who netted $800 000 as a day trader and became the youngest person (15) accused of stock-market fraud by the SEC. As Michael Lewis said, when he first read the newspaper reports, he didn't understand them, not just what the kid was supposed to have done wrong, he didn't understand what the kid had actually done. <br />Lewis has the ability to capture the Zeitgeist of an era. At the end of the eighties, Liar's Poker captured the greed of the bond market. At the end of the nineties, The New New Thing showed how Silicon Valley was redefining the American economy. In 2002 it is the Internet.<BR> <BR>Today the hype of the Internet has been followed by casual acceptance - that all it does is to increase the speed of information flow\\". Lewis imagines a crusty old baron, blasted out of his castle, looking at his first cannon and saying: \\"All it does is speed up balls - that is all.\\" <br />Just as the cannon changed the social order of Europe, the Internet is redefining insiders and outsiders, thereby creating profound social shifts. Lewis's stories and comments are funny, thought provoking, and piercinglysharp.	2002-09-08

Intelligent professionals are free agents, accustomed to having the autonomy to work on gruelling assignments with little supervision. They are relentlessly demanding of themselves and others, and the best are often are prima donnas, quick both to take offence and to give it. Many companies believe that their professionals are unmanageable, and some have given up trying.<BR> <BR>The group leaders within a practice have to act as player-coaches. They are responsible for their own performance but also that of their peers. They must manage their peers but with limited authority. They must encourage individuals; yet somehow forge them into a cohesive team. They are expected to lead as the primus inter pares, the first among equals.<br />In First Among Equals, McKenna and Maister write the book they wish they had read when first given the challenge of leading a group. The first part helps the leader clarify his/her role. The second part deals with the activities required to coach, lead, inspire, and guide the individual members. The third part turns to team management. The fourth discusses building for the future: managing juniors, monitoring success and problems of size. <br />The book is written like a series of seminar presentations. The authors take care to tell you what they will tell you, then to tell you, and finally to tell you what they told you. They use lists, which are then unpacked and dissected in detail. Even if this style does not appeal to you, you will find the advice practical and easy to reference. <br />David Maister's classic, Managing the Professional Services Firm, has long been compulsory reading for senior partners in professional practices. First Among Equals should be given to each of their managers.	2002-09-08

These values underpin society and social interaction.<br />South Africa has a legacy, which saw such institutions torn apart. Deputy President Zuma said to the launch of the Moral Regeneration Movement: \\"something is wrong within the fabric of our society, and that we urgently need to do something about it\\". Repairing this fabric may well require more than retracing the historical causes; building something up is more difficult than tearing it down.<br />The disruption of social institutions has apparently taken place before, even on a global scale. The industrial revolution saw the dramatic change from an agricultural to an industrial society. The shift from gemeinschaft (community) to gesellschaft (society) shattered communities and community institutions. Crime in all major cities increased, families broke down, illegitimacy rates rose and alcohol consumption rocketed. Yet by the middle of the nineteenth century the disruption had began to recede.<br />The book, the Great Disruption tackles the the transition from the industrial to the post industrial era. In the first section, Francis Fukuyama provides evidence of wide scale changes in social order and looks at the depletion of what he calls social capital. In the second section he asks where social order comes from and how it evolves. The third part of the book looks to sources of social order.<br />Charles Handy, the management guru, notes that Fukuyama writes books, which generate heated debate even among those who have not read them. Fukuyama believes that social order once disrupted tends to be remade once again. He sees the world wide social disruption as starting to recede. He does not believe that capitalism depletes calls social capital; in fact,he claims it creates new order to replace the one that it destroyed.<br />This book is thought provoking. Fukuyama raises the very issues, with which South Africa iscurrently grappling.<br />Churchill once said that first we shape our institutions, and then they shape us. How these institutions should be shaped, and what must be done to shape them remains one of this country's most pressing challenges.	2002-05-14

While individual talent remains critical, team skills become increasingly important as organisations become flatter and more open.<br />`High Five' is a parable celebrating teamwork. It centres on an executive, who is smart, works hard, and meets his targets. He is fired because he was unable to make others more productive. By coaching his son's hockey team, he learns the importance of not `hogging the puck'. And of course returns with this message as a consultant.<br />Like \\"The one minute manager\\" and \\"Who moved my cheese\\", this book is written as a simple down to earth story. You are unlikely to discover great tips or new techniques, and if you dislike being patronised, perhaps you should stay away.<br />However, success often consists of motivating oneself to keep up the basics. This book does that charmingly. It is a book, which will be bought in bulk and shared widely.	2002-02-19

The  five-year-old company has become E-commerce's success story, and is so well  known that some people refer to the other Amazon, the one that is  shrinking, as Amazon dot country. <br />Robert Spector's book takes us behind  the scenes. It traces the biography of Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO,  documents the ongoing history, and gives an inside view of the  \\"revolutionary business model that changed the world\\". <br />The model puzzles  investors and businesspeople, who ask: \\"When will Amazon make a profit?\\"  According to Bezos, this is difficult to predict. \\"Our ... business was  profitable in December 1998 ... a seasonably strange month. This was a  mistake ... if we had been better organized we could have avoided this.\\"  <br />This does not mean that Bezos subscribes to \\"new math\\", or that he is  financially naïve. Bezos gave up a seven-figure Wall Street income and  appreciates the shortcomings of medieval accounting; he has his own tools,  and understands valuation perhaps even better than he understands  technology or books. He may prove spectacularly wrong, but one cannot  double guess him without his inside knowledge.  <br />In many other ways,  Amazon is the classic case study. Bezos takes irreversible decisions well,  and other decisions quickly. We see how Bezos decided on the book segment  by dissecting and dismantling the value chain, how he gathered statistics  to shortlist Seattle, how he systematically settled on the name, and how he  chose the key people. <br />Bezos has been likened to Bill Gates, brilliant  technologist, brilliant manager. He created a culture where the founder  helped pack books. He spared no dime on solutions, the \\"technical  pessimism\\" ensuring that Amazon could scale beyond everyone else's wildest  dreams. But he also bought furniture that looked cheap, though it cost  more, to reinforce aculture of not wasting money.<br />The book is at its  best reporting the unfolding story. Spector did not have direct access to  Bezos and, ironically, this makes the book at times uncritical. Bezos wakes  up every morning \\"trying to confound those who encapsulate Amazon.com into  an eight second sound bite\\". This book is the 250-page version and gives  the flavour of an industry with a growth rate \\"one doesn't usually find  outside a petri dish\\".	2000-08-09

Since then it has made up for lost time, and as Stuart Crainer writes, we have all become managers, whether we manage  hospitals, schools, funeral parlours, farms or football teams. Management  has become &quot;the art and science of our times, and management thinkers  have become its high priests, the guru's&quot;.<br />Despite this, there is  still no one ultimate truth. Theories mushroom, each one promising more  than its predecessor. The growth is fed by aspirant managers &quot;seeking  recipes for success and ideas that can distinguish them from the  crowd.&quot; Many managers occupy their time &quot;inflicting ill-advised  ideas on their organisation.&quot;<br />Yet most organisations are being run  the way they were when Drucker began to study them. &quot;We have a lot of  new tools&quot; says Drucker&quot;, but not very many ideas.&quot; The  resulting cynicism, we learn, has made Dilbert the best selling business  book of all time. As, Dilbert himself puts it, &quot;re-engineering was  invented by Dr Jonas Salk as a cure for Quality Programmes&quot;.<br />This is  not to write off the guru mega-industry. Nor can it relieve us of the  pressure to keep abreast of the latest fashion. As Crainer points out in  his introduction, &quot;if your son or daughter discovers you have not  heard of the latest pop sensation, they are incredulous. ... Managers  behave similarly when they discover a colleague, who knows nothing of the  latest addition to the management vocabulary.&quot; The only thing worse  that slavishly following management theory, is ignoring it completely.<br />In  his ultimate business Guru book, Crainer summarises one hundred (fifty in  my soft back edition but there seems to be a new edition, in print and  available from Amazon.com in 24 hours) of the most significant contributors  to the management literature. As befitting a young discipline, he hasspread his net appropriately wide. <br />Thus we find academics such as  Michael Porter, Philip Kotler, Edgar Schein and Douglas McGregor whose  theories are studied in business school. We find executives such as Henry  Ford, Alfred Sloan, Harold Geneen, and Thomas Watson Junior who, through  practice and theory, put their stamp firmly onto the corporate world. And  we find the consultants Marvin Bower, Tom Peters, Bruce Henderson and James  Champy, who produce &quot;the best ideas&quot;, while in the corporate  equivalent of a research laboratory.<br />Also appropriate is the wide  spectrum of belief. Arch conservatives such as Frederick Taylor and Igor  Ansoff are included, along with the liberal left such as Peter Senge, and  Frons Trompenaars. We find Charles Handy &quot;who has an unerring tendency  to state the obvious&quot;, but also with Richard Pascale, who tackles the  tension of real life contradictions, head on.<br />Each guru is introduced  with a quote, their breakthrough ideas in key words and their most  important book. This is followed by three to five pages discussing their  contribution and putting it into the context of current thinking. Crainer  presents each guru with an appropriate mix of sympathy and scepticism.  <br />Crainer has interviewed and worked with many of the worlds top business  thinkers, and this is evident in his work. He presents enough to enable the  reader to hold his own, then shows us where look should we want to delve  deeper. <br />Dilbert, the one great thinker not included, said:  &quot;everything I've learnt in my entire life can be boiled down to a  dozen bullet points, several of which I have already forgotten&quot;. This  book presents the dozen bullet points of the other 50 thinkers who 'made  management'. Some of these points are indeed worth remembering.	2000-07-31

Each chapter is a two-page piece of advice, \\"crisp, blunt, frank, generally  ... judgmental\\" and very, very easy to digest. I read book in less than half  an hour.<br />Some of the seventy-five pieces of advice are cynical, \\"Always  take the job that offers the most money\\", and \\"Make allies of your peers  subordinates\\". Some are puritanical \\"Don't have a drink with the gang\\" and  \\"Don't smoke\\". Some are eccentric \\"Send hand written notes\\", and \\"Go to the  library one day a month\\". And some are good emotional intelligence \\"Never  write a nasty memo\\" and \\"Live for today, plan for tomorrow, forget  yesterday\\". <br />You probably won't agree with all of them, nor agree that  all of them are profound. Yet some may strike a cord, or remind you of  something you really know but no longer practice. They are written in a  style which will appeal to some, but not all.

As one of these characters `Chainsaw' Dunlop writes, \\"You are  not in business to be liked. ... If you want a friend get a dog. I'm not  taking chances; I have two dogs.\\" Turnaround experts are a stark reminder  that Al Capone also wore dark suites and would probably be trading today,  if only he had paid his taxes.<br />Clearing aside the hype, rescuing a  company requires a combination of long and short-term thinking, empowerment  and control, leadership and good management. <br />First and foremost, a  turnaround requires a good team; building and directing that team is the  prime task of the leader.<br />Much is written about teams but in reality most  business teams are committees, where people write minutes, attend to  protect their interests, and argue their point of view. A real team is a  small group of people with complementary skills and a common, overriding  goal. Successful turnarounds are case studies in teamwork; turnaround team  members learn to trust and anticipate, and often look back at this period  as the only real team experience of their working lives. <br />The team is  critical as a turnaround is too much for an one person to handle,  particularly given the time the leader spends on stage re-assuring  stakeholders, employees, creditors, financial institutions and suppliers.  Part of the mythos around corporate turnarounds comes about because the  leader acts as lightning rod to the outside world.<br />The other part is the  critical short-term activity, the need to cut fat, to re-negotiate  contracts, to focus and to eliminate the non-core. Successful turnarounds  are associated with `cutting once and deeply', with dramatic cash flow  injections and with brinkmanship negotiation practices.<br />This is not to  ignore the long term. `Neutron Jack' Welsh of General Electric, despite his  name, articulated the `number one or number two strategy' that took General  electric to a decade of spectacular results. And Dunlap himself says, \\"If  you don't have a vision of the future you are going no-where .... you can't  inspire ... the remaining people ... if you don't combine the cutback with a  vision of the future.\\" This, he says, is the real art of leadership and  management.<br />In their book, Slatter and Lovett claim that \\"(good)  turnaround management is (good) everyday management\\". Certainly, as they  themselves point out, management in a turnaround situation tends to be more  autocratic; but then more decisions are mission critical, what Charles  Handy refers to as `decisions below the waterline'. A good book covering  turnaround is a useful book in day to day management.<br />Corporate  turnaround is about good management, albeit sharpened by the spectre of the  bank manager at the door. It has a text book approach based on an earlier  book, Corporate recovery - A guide to turnaround Management by Dr. Slatter.  It is systematic and full of useful frameworks, matrices and graphs. It  covers the symptoms and causes of decline and the characteristics of crisis  situations as well as a framework for achieving turnaround and checklists  in terms of crisis stabilisation, stakeholder management and achieving  focus. <br />This is a useful book about good practice and although it is  drawn from real examples, it is not a book about super heroes. If you want  super heroes, I recommend a subscription to KTV. I'm not taking chances - I  have a subscription to Cartoon network too.	2000-05-13

The change has to be right, it has to feel right and it has to meet  the needs of the key stakeholders. In saying this we are exploding the myth  of scientific management and of the rational organisation that obeys well  defined scientific rules. And with it comes the recognition that  organisations comprise of people. <br />Unlike machines, people need to take  part, they need to be informed, consulted and motivated. All these involve  conversations, some of which are difficult. Too often we shy away from  difficult conversations, thereby leaving critical issues  unaddressed.<br />Difficult conversations are difficult because are a tangle  of facts, emotions and perceptions. However small adjustments in our  assumptions and in the way we engage can greatly improve the chances of  success. <br />According to the authors, difficult conversations take place at  a rational, emotional and identity level. Even at the rational level we  make mistakes. We assume that we are talking about what is true and not  what is important, and we assume that we know the intentions of  others.<br />This book provides a conceptual framework within which to  understand difficult conversations. It also provides the tools and  techniques to handle and diffuse a conversation and convert it into a  `learning conversation'. It shows how to use the third story, a neutral  statement from the outside, to start a conversation and illustrates  techniques for exploring the issues and solving problems. The examples are  real and realistic. They showing how the inappropriate responses do lead to  escalation and they are used to coach the reader through the  alternatives.<br />In the early eighties, in \\"Getting to YES\\" the Harvard  Negotiation Project showed us how to negotiate interests and not positions,  Ten years later the sequel, \\"Getting past NO\\" showed how to initiate such a  win-win discussion with a reluctant party, the negotiator who had not read  the first book.<br />\\"Difficult conversations\\" is the latest in this series.  It tells you how to open the dialogue even when you are one of the  reluctant parties. It deals with the conversations we avoid, or which, when  we don't avoid them, tend to escalate. This book is useful both in  management and in everyday life. \\"Getting past YES\\" sold over three million  copies. It would be a pity if \\"Difficult Conversations\\" sold any less.	2000-05-12

And if the tales we read are true, then the medieval  alchemists worked long and hard. They were driven, not by money, but by  their passion and by their all consuming quest. <br />Charles Handy sees  modern day entrepreneurs as the new alchemists. In his words they \\"create  something out of nothing and turn the equivalent of base metal into a kind  of gold\\". Similar to the alchemist of old, the entrepreneur is driven by a  vision, and is looked upon by society with awe.<br />Indeed, to many, the  entrepreneur is the hero of the free enterprise society. Certainly, those  who began with nothing, and create something quite new, often become our  role models. Henry Ford, Bill Gates, Sabeer Bhatia, and Richard Branson, to  name a few, capture the public imagination in a way that career managers  never do. <br />In `The new Alchemists', Handy interviews twenty-nine  entrepreneurs in and around London. They range from well-known success  stories such as Richard Branson of Virgin, and Robert Ayling of British  Airways to figures less known, but with whom many of us are better able to  identify. They come from different areas, - business, social, and the arts  - and have different ages and different backgrounds.<br />Handy does have a  framework of what it takes to be a good entrepreneur, namely dedication,  doggedness, and difference. It is, he notes, similar to Galton's framework,  namely ability, zeal, and capacity for hard work. However, this book is not  a profound analysis of what it takes to be an entrepreneur. That is found  in more discursive works such as `Innovation and Entrepreneurship', by  Peter Drucker, or more recently `Goldfinger', by Robert Heller. Rather he  focuses on the entrepreneurs themselves. <br />Each entrepreneur is the  subject of a short piece, based on Handy's interviews. Through these  pieces, they offer their insights into the events that shaped their lives,  a glimpse into what they find important as people, and in cases heartfelt  advice. <br />With each piece comes a photo-portrait by the author's wife.  <br />Elisabeth Handy is a self-published photographer, and her style,  `photo-joiners', provide intriguing images which combine different aspects  of the subjects life. Indeed, in some cases, as Charles Handy points out,  the pictures reveal more about the subjects than their words. The pictures  complement the text and help define the nature of the book.<br />This book is  the ultimate coffee table book. The essays are self-contained and intended  for browsing. The pieces are uncritical, but that is indeed their charm.  The resultant book is upbeat and will make an inspirational and optimistic  statement in your reception room.	2000-05-12

Either they fail to implement the measures, or the measures fail to have the expected impact.<br />Organizations  execute four 'mission critical' activities, for a scorecard to succeed.  Each is more difficult than might appear and must be performed by a  different part of the organization.<br />1. Articulating the strategy: Top  management must articulate and disseminate the strategy.  More than  measuring success, a performance system communicates a strategy. Without a  strategy, the performance measures become an `anything goes' exercise.  `Anything goes in theory' means that `everything stays in practice'. <br />2.  Designing the measures: A core task team must design the measures to avoid  uneconomic behavior.  Poorly thought out measures create counter productive  activity. <br />3. Operationalizing the measures: Once measures are  defined, programmers operationalize and automate them. <br />Even revenue can  be complicated in practice: When is it recorded,  and what does it include.  The task team may well find themselves getting what they asked for, and not  what they wanted. <br />4. Getting the buy-in: Change management skills  are needed to align the changes and create buy in. Dilbert cynically states  that there are two steps to a great performance measurement system. 1)  Gather information and 2) ignore it. For performance measurement to work,  the system must be accepted, understood, and aligned to the reward. <br />The  book, `The Balanced Scorecard' by Kaplan and Norton has become compulsory  reading for middle management. It is very good, with the one weakness that  it makes performance measurement look deceptively simple.	2000-05-07

As `Chainsaw' Dunlop writes, \\"You are not in business to be  liked. ... If you want a friend, get a dog. I'm not taking chances; I have  two dogs.\\" Turnaround experts are a stark reminder that Al Capone also wore  dark suites and would probably be trading today, if only he had paid his  taxes.<br />Clearing aside the hype, rescuing a company requires a combination  of long and short-term thinking, empowerment and control, leadership and  good management. <br />First, a turnaround requires a good team; building and  directing that team is the prime task of the leader.<br />Much is written  about teams but in reality most business teams are committees, where people  write minutes, attend to protect their interests, and argue their point of  view. A real team is a small group of people with complementary skills and  a common, overriding goal. Successful turnarounds are case studies in  teamwork; turnaround team members learn to trust and anticipate, and often  look back at this period as the only real team experience of their working  lives. <br />The team is critical as a turnaround is too much for an one  person to handle, particularly given the time the leader spends on stage  re-assuring stakeholders, employees, creditors, financial institutions and  suppliers. Part of the mythos around corporate turnarounds comes about  because the leader acts as lightning rod to the outside world.<br />The other  part is the critical short-term activity, the need to cut fat, to  re-negotiate contracts, to focus and to eliminate the non-core. Successful  turnarounds are associated with `cutting once and deeply', with dramatic  cash flow injections and with brinkmanship negotiation practices.<br />This is  not to ignore the long term. `Neutron Jack' Welsh of General Electric,  despite his name, articulated the `number one or number two strategy' that  took General electric to a decade of spectacular results. And Dunlap  himself says: \\"If you don't have a vision of the future you are going  no-where. .... (Y)ou can't inspire ... the remaining people ... if you don't  combine the cutback with a vision of the future.\\" This, he says, is the  real art of leadership and management.<br />Corporate turnaround is about good  management, albeit sharpened by the spectre of the bank manager at the  door. But if you don't like superheroes, this is not your book.  <br />I  enjoyed this book, but as a kid I always had a fascination with  superheroes.  I still have a subscription to KTV, and  I'm not taking  chances - I have a subscription to Cartoon network too.	2000-05-05

Unlike the others, he has achieved mass circulation and  adorns t-shirts, coffee mugs and cubicle walls. <br />The key to success, says  Adams, is segmentation. \\"If you can sell enough units to the Stupid Rich...  then you can lower your prices and sell to the Stupid Poor, (which is)  where the real volume is.\\"<br />The Dilbert principle states that people are  idiots. We are just idiots about different things at different times. \\"No  matter how smart you are, you spend much of your day being an idiot.\\"  Big  corporations encourage idiocy to thrive. They reward the symptoms of  competence, above competence itself. <br />Scott Adams himself had a brief  foray as the super consultant, Ray Mebert. He dressed up, put on a wig  (never forget the emotional intelligence of good hair), and helped a group  of executives at an international company create \\"the longest, most  useless, buzzword-heavy mission statement on earth\\".

Since then it has made up for lost  time, and as Stuart Crainer writes, we have all become managers, whether we  manage hospitals, schools, funeral parlours, farms or football teams.  Management has become \\"the art and science of our times, and management  thinkers have become its high priests, the guru's\\".<br />Despite this, there  is still no one ultimate truth. Theories mushroom, each one promising more  than its predecessor. The growth is fed by aspirant managers \\"seeking  recipes for success and ideas that can distinguish them from the crowd.\\"  Many managers occupy their time \\"inflicting ill-advised ideas on their  organisation.\\"<br />Yet most organisations are being run the way they were  when Drucker began to study them. \\"We have a lot of new tools\\" says  Drucker\\", but not very many ideas.\\" The resulting cynicism, we learn, has  made Dilbert the best selling business book of all time. As, Dilbert  himself puts it, \\"re-engineering was invented by Dr Jonas Salk as a cure  for Quality Programmes\\".<br />This is not to write off the guru mega-industry.  Nor can it relieve us of the pressure to keep abreast of the latest  fashion. As Crainer points out in his introduction, \\"if your son or  daughter discovers you have not heard of the latest pop sensation, they are  incredulous. ... Managers behave similarly when they discover a colleague,  who knows nothing of the latest addition to the management vocabulary.\\" The  only thing worse that slavishly following management theory, is ignoring it  completely.<br />In his ultimate business Guru book, Crainer summarises one  hundred (fifty in my soft back edition) of the most significant  contributors to the management literature. As befitting a young discipline,  he has spread his net appropriately wide. <br />Thus we find academics such as  Michael Porter, Philip Kotler, Edgar Schein and Douglas McGregor whose  theories are studied in business school. We find executives such as Henry  Ford, Alfred Sloan, Harold Geneen, and Thomas Watson Junior who, through  practice and theory, put their stamp firmly onto the corporate world. And  we find the consultants Marvin Bower, Tom Peters, Bruce Henderson and James  Champy, who produce \\"the best ideas\\", while in the corporate equivalent of  a research laboratory.<br />Also appropriate is the wide spectrum of belief.  Arch conservatives such as Frederick Taylor and Igor Ansoff are included,  along with the liberal left such as Peter Senge, and Frons Trompenaars. We  find Charles Handy \\"who has an unerring tendency to state the obvious\\", but  also with Richard Pascale, who tackles the tension of real life  contradictions, head on.<br />Each guru is introduced with a quote, their  breakthrough ideas in key words and their most important book. This is  followed by three to five pages discussing their contribution and putting  it into the context of current thinking. Crainer presents each guru with an  appropriate mix of sympathy and scepticism. <br />Crainer has interviewed and  worked with many of the worlds top business thinkers, and this is evident  in his work. He presents enough to enable the reader to hold his own, then  shows us where look should we want to delve deeper. <br />Dilbert, the one  great thinker not included, said: \\"everything I've learnt in my entire life  can be boiled down to a dozen bullet points, several of which I have  already forgotten\\". This book presents the dozen bullet points of the other  100 thinkers who 'made management'. Some of these points are indeed worth  remembering.	2000-01-02

For this reason, marketing is perhaps  the primary challenge of any good management team. <br />The marketing  executive is routinely expected to target a market, position a product,  match features to benefits, select channels, and establish the pricing  policy. In addition he or she allocates and primes the sales force, manages  the brand, and manages category profitability. Indeed, it has been said,  that the best training for a future marketing director is a short spell as  CEO.<br />Professor Kotler is often regarded the world's foremost marketing  authority. He has been writing textbooks over four decades and his eight  hundred and fifty-page book, Marketing Management, is widely referred to as  the bible. In Kotler on Marketing, he takes the reader through a whirlwind  tour of the marketing discipline. Marketing is more than \\"selling with a  college degree\\". Rather it supplements selling, using strategic tools, such  as segmentation, and tactical tools, which help match benefits to needs. As  Dilbert says, the most important segment is the `stupid rich', and if you  sell enough units there, then you develop economies of scale and can sell  to the `stupid poor', the segment \\"where the real volume is\\". <br />The book  has four chapters on strategic marketing which teach us how to build value  and deliver brand equity. It then has four chapters on tactical marketing  which teach us to design the marketing mix, and two chapters on  administrative marketing, which involves planning, organising, evaluating  and controlling. It has a further section on transformational marketing,  looking at trends and predicting the essential marketing issues of the  future.<br />Management textbooks are well known for their acronyms and  alliterative lists, the three R's, the four P's, and the seven S's to name  a few. This book is contains many such lists from winning marketing  practices, to an updated version of the four P model, as well as the five  generic value propositions. Each chapter has questions at the end to help  the manager \\"apply the content to his company's situation\\", and there is an  appendix at the end looking at success strategies of marketing in different  industries.<br />Jane Gephart, editor of the Sloan Management review, asks her  contributors if they can write an introduction which \\"does not mention the  pace of change in today's world\\". Kotler on Marketing mentions the pace of  change repeatedly and uses the standard case studies such as Wal-Mart and  South West Airlines in their expected settings. However, if you are not one  of the three million students who have bought Professor Kotler's text  books, and don't have the time to wade through 800 pages, then you will  find this book easy to read and comprehensive. It will give you the  framework, the questions, and the language needed to hold an intelligent  marketing conversation. In that sense, this book is itself a case study in  marketing; it is a repackaged product, aimed at a target market and using  value pricing.<br />Book Review: Kotler on Marketing, How to Create, Win and  Dominate Markets, by Philip Kotler, the free press 1999. <br />Dr Michael  Gering, Michael is a director at Sediba consulting, a company which he  co-founded.	1999-12-29

For the executive, the key lies in the question: \\"How do we serve the shareholders in the short term, yet  leave behind a long term legacy with which to be remembered?\\" <br />While  these two aims appear contradictory, they are linked via the organisation's  system of shared values.<br />Values work in the present and the future. They  set the framework for consistent decision making, yet remain with an  organisation long after its physical assets have depreciated. Values also  link the organisation to the society in which it operates and to its social  agenda, namely the creation of wealth, the protection of the environment,  and the support for social equity.<br />It is in the context of the social  agenda that John Elkington asks us whether capitalism is sustainable, and  whether it has made progress over the last hundred years. \\"Is it progress\\",  he asks, \\"if a cannibal uses a fork?\\"<br />Not that we expect progress to be  uniform. Lenin measured progress as two steps forward, and one step back,  and even that is steeped in the paradigm of central planning. Free  enterprise progresses by many steps in many different directions. Yet the  record shows that de-central systems make progress, less systematically,  but perhaps more surely than central ones.<br />However, the random nature of  such progress generates many deceptive examples, where the same instance  may be used to support contradictory theories. Thus, The Body Shop and  Shell become symbols of corporate responsibility, but also corporate  duplicity, while Nike and Intel become examples of corporate greed but also  corporate responsiveness. Unplanned progress appears as a subtle, difficult  to navigate, terrain.<br />Yet the pitfalls are great. We live in a world,  where renewable resources such as trees are \\"mined rather than harvested\\".  We find children on the one side of the planet working as slaves to produce  fashion items for consumers on the other side. Furthermore the public, ever  more aware of social and environmental issues, mobilise suddenly and to  dramatic effect as ABB, Intel, Monsanto, Shell, Nike, and Texaco and many  others testify.<br />To help us navigate, Elkington introduces his triple  bottom line, which comprises of social, economic, and environmental  measures. He uses this to expound on `the seven revolutions affecting  sustainability': Markets, Values, Transparency, Life-cycle Technology,  Partnerships, Time, and Corporate Governance. He looks at the need for  regulation, but also for regulatory frameworks \\"which operate, as far as  possible, through market processes and are intrinsically pro-competition\\".  The triple bottom line becomes his yardstick for corporate values.<br />When  people start talking of values, said Mark Twain once, it is time to count  the silver. Since the early sixties environmentalists have told us that  \\"things will go very well and then suddenly collapse\\". Yet this proved  indistinguishable from the prediction that \\"things will go very well, and  then even better\\". The predictions of our demise have proved to be greatly  exaggerated.<br />Yet, `Cannibals with forks' raises all the relevant issues.  If you are in an industry, which is subject to the whim of public pressure,  or if you are trying to solve the riddle of long term sustainability, then  `Cannibals with forks' will make an interesting and profitable read.	1999-12-29

People come there from all over the world, armed with talent and  initiative, and not much else. They are hoping for that one break, which  will write them into history and make them \\"so much money that they never  have to make money again\\". They are driven by stories of normal people who  made it big, stories which invite the punchline, \\"well if he did it, then I  can do it too.\\"<br />Sabeer Bhatia's story is a prime example. Sabeer arrived  in America as penniless immigrant on a scholarship, yet one decade later he  was playing brinkmanship with Microsoft, holding out for that extra $50  million on a $350 million offer. Sabeer's story is told by Bronson as a  meta-story, in order to cast light on `the lucky or great' question. Is  Sabeer a genius, or did he \\"just happen to be in the right place and at the  right time.\\" We learn how Sabeer was turned down by over twenty venture  capitalists before he obtained funding for his hotmail concept. But we also  see how cannily he protected his idea, by approaching potential funders  with an alternative product, one which he knew would be rejected, to see  whether they rejected it for the right or wrong reasons. More than once on  his way to becoming president of the company with quickest growing  subscriber base in history, Basheer bet the company fortune on a single  throw.<br />Yet this book is not about the Valley's most important people;  indeed to Bronson that would be forcing an East Coast paradigm onto a West  Coast phenomenon. Instead, the book sets out to capture the spirit of  Silicon Valley. As Bronson writes: \\"it is about opportunity to become a  mover and shaker, not about being one.\\" <br />In this vein, we follow a group  of newcomers in their enthusiastic quest, to learn in the end, that only  one of them is to make it. We do the rounds with the salesmen `dropping his  pants' in an attempt to maintain the company's stock analysts `growth  category stock' rating. We sit with a CEO through his IPO, which becomes  the last, heart-wrenching, roller-coaster stretch of the \\"eighteen years  that it took him to become an overnight success\\". We ponder  the `ABCDEF'  problem, which are the range of options facing a  Java programmer, who want  to be associated with success, but for whom \\"the variables that he has to  go on are not the variables (XYZ) which determine the outcome\\". <br />Whereas  most journalists screen articles using a `bullshit detector', Po Bronson  claims to use a `Goose Bump Meter' to let him know which stories to follow.  The stories merge to become a soap opera; they stand alone, and yet they  interweave to become a greater whole. The resulting book is a riveting  series of interrelated anecdotes and analyses, which paint a different and  yet compelling reality. <br />Book Review: The nudist on the late shift and  other tales of Silicon Valley, by Po Bronson.

The management guru industry is estimated to exceed a billion  dollars and management books, including several by Peters himself, now  regularly find their way into the best seller list. His later writings and  teachings have sometimes inspired and sometimes puzzled a new generation of  managers.<br />Much has been written about Tom Peters' success. More than once  he appears to have been lucky with his timing. `In search of excellence' is  a case in point. With its feel good factor, it came out when America's  unemployment reached anall time high. There is more to his success story  than luck. Stuart Crainer's book lets us glimpse Peters' almost unlimited  energy and enthusiasm. In the period after the book came out Peters was  doing over 150 seminars a year, often speeches in different cities on the  same day. Peters and Waterman distributed over 15 000 copies of the draft  book, a practice then unheard of, giving the book a cult status, even  before it was released.<br />Stuart Crainer traces the career and thinking of  Peters. He looks at his early career, his time with McKinsey, the gestation  of his first book, how he broke away to set up on his own leading to his  management guru business and his subsequent writing. It is a critical  analysis quoting both supporters and critics. The book gets beneath the Tom  Peters myth and tackles the issues with which Peters was  grappling.<br />Micklethwait and Wooldridge of The Economist conclude in `The  Witch Doctors', that \\"Tom Peters faces the uncomfortable epitaph: what he  did -  launching, leading and defining the current management boom is more  significant than what he actually said\\". This book is a fascinating, well  written account of what Tom Peters did, but also a well reasoned and  critical discussion of what he actually said.<br />Book Review: Corporate Man  to Corporate Skunk - The Tom Peters Phenomenon, by Stuart Crainer.
