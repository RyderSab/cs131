It covers, in magnificent detail, the witchcraft of the Chenka in Northern Siberia, the sorcery of the Yoruba in Mali and Nigeria, the voudou of Haiti, the Santeria of Cuba, and many more. The author presents it so well that it takes a while of indecision to make up your mind: is all this for real, or did he make it up? You be the judge.<br />The baseline is a series of murders indicating an unknown animalistic cult. Part time narrator is Dolores Tuoey, originally named Jane Doe. Helping her to clear the air in Miami are detectives Jimmy Paz and Cletis Barlow. The victims are women, pregnant and about to give birth, in Miami: Deandra Wallace, Teresa Vargas and Alice Powers. And then there is Dolores' husband, the famous writer De Witt Moore. He is in and out of Africa, apparently learning to be a world-class sorcerer. <br />Who did the killing, and why? We are told two thirds through the book. But how do you arrest a spirit. And how do you stop sorcery? This is not a story of black magic and legerdemain, but a fascinating and horrifying trip into the heart of African culture.	2004-01-07

She thought of switching her supplier from Vine to a London Gang. An example was needed and a point made. But now there is a vacancy in the setup and this vacuum needs filling.<br />A suave scout appears from London, dressed metropolitan-like and walking like a Lovely Mover. Our old acquaintance Panicky Ralf Ember enters the melee and big supplier Barney wants things cleaned up in his favour. Before that can happen, Vine kills two associates, and somebody (Lovely Mover?) kills Vine.<br />Detective Chief Inspector Colin Harpur is busy as always, straddling a multitude of fences. He actually is paid handsome money by Vine, calling it essential undercover work.<br />The story slouches along. Progress is made by intuition and gut feeling, and knowledge is obtained by osmosis. This makes for an unsatisfactory procedure. Pity.	2003-12-18

They were born on the last day of 1938 and are, by now, in their forties. They live in Frome, Rhode Island, a state devastated by the sharp comments in this book.<br />Dorcas is the town librarian and has the prunish character to go with it. Abigail was defiled at the age of 14 by the local football team and apparently enjoyed it. Hilda, a family friend, catalogs in a book all the terrible things that have come to Abigail's mind over the years and that have been executed by her and on her. At present, Abigail is in jail accused of killing her husband, while Dorcas reads through the biography. Her comments and corrections are the subject of this book.<br />The two sisters loved each other dearly despite their opposite makeup. Sexless Dorcas never envied Abigail and her loose life style. She called her sister the Wife of Bath, with great power and no dignity. She herself would be the reverse. <br />And then the devil in the disguise of suave Conrad Lowe enters the picture. He tries to seduce Dorcas but settles for the easier Abigail. And here comes the Faustian pact: Abigail must shed all the gross excess weight she carries around or Conrad will dissolve out of her life. Strangely enough, and for the first time in her life, she gives up, submits meekly and looses the required weight. But Conrad does not feel that the pact has been satisfied. He keeps maltraiting Abigail who cracks and kills him.<br />The story is beautifully told, in full three dimensions and surprise happenings. It is not the belly laugh some commercial reviews promise, but it is full of wonderful little chuckles.. Foremost, it is an absorbing portrait of two women who seem so very strange and yet are so familiar.	2003-12-04

Its passengers were ten women from the Balkans. All of them died. At about the same time, Avvocato Carlo Trevisan is murdered on a train heading for Venice. He is one of the top lawyers in Venice, with a list of clients that includes most of the high and mighty in the city. And in short order two more men, both of them connected to Trevisan, are murdered.<br />What connects these three people? Commissario Guido Brunetti goes to work, helped by the usual cast - Sergeante Vianello, Signorina Elettra Zorzi, and the whole questura - and supported by his wife Professoressa Paola Falier.<br />Brunetti works meticulously by checking out phone calls and then connecting them to locations. He finds the cross references and the connection to the crashed truck: women imported for sales into prostitution. Slowly but surely Brunetti uncovers the whole network and thus finds the person who committed the murders.	2003-11-29

Singapore has fallen, Darwin has been bombed, and people are extremely nervous.<br />And so we meet young curator Frank Darragh, whose specialty - if not his foremost - joy it is, to hear confession and then to absolve the sinner. Now Frank meets young and good-looking Kate Heggerty, whose husband has been taken prisoners by the Germans in North Africa, Kate is a proud woman who stands by her deeds and does not need a confession. Frank, of course, sees this differently.<br />Frank now wrestles with the soul of Kate and seems bent on wrestling with her body, as well. But Keneally is far too good a writer to follow such a cliche. Kate - the Temptress - is killed by strangulation.<br />Now we meet Fratelli, an MP in the US Army. Fratelli is the Devil. He knows the catholic canon inside out, is very soft-spoken and paid court to Kate Heggerty. Frank - who is rather innocent about humans - thinks a lot of him. But then Fratelli turns and accuses Frank of stealing Kate's soul from his grip and having started to also steal her body. Fratelli goes after Frank, who is already in deep trouble with his pastor and the hierarchy all the way to Sidney.<br />Will Father Frank be damaged?

One part tells the story of the British war against the native tribe in the mid-19th century - the war now known as the Zulu war. The other part deals with the present time. <br />Camugu comes from Johannesburg and tries to fit into the somewhat primitive village of Oorloha. He lands in the middle of the fight that has been going on for 150 years. In those days, the teenage prophetess Nongqawuse Told the tribe that all cattle had be killed and the harvest destroyed. Thus the tribe was split between Believers and Unbelievers, each group blaming the other for whatever went wrong. And so the verbal fighting goes back and forth.<br />Xhosa used to be a real tribe, but nowadays only the language survives as part of the Bantu languages. That accounts for the click sounds that are mentioned. The Zulu war did take place, of course, and the prophesy also happened. The story is interwoven with the local history.<br />The narrative has won prizes and has been called \\"brilliant' and loaded with genuine mythic power. Unfortunately, I can't see it that way. The story drags on and on without there being much of a concrete action. The two time periods are so intermingled as to confuse the reader who constantly has to check the names to place it correctly. Untranslated local words and expressions can be used to good effect, but here they are overdone. And the story itself is not new, not exciting, and utterly predictable.	2003-10-24

Ray Mitchell grew up in the housing projects of Dempsey, N.J., went to LA to become a successful TV writer, and now returned to Dempsey with enough money to allow himself a few quirks. Mainly, re wants to reconnect with his 13-year old daughter Ruby.<br />Nerese Ammons, a black detective within months of retirement, knows Ray from childhood and remembers him as being on her side when the other school children gave her grief.<br />Ray wants to do good so that people will love him. But he does not know how to do it without coming across  like the Salvation Army. He gets lied to, he gets ripped off, he just simply cannot connect because he forgot about the slums and no longer speaks their language.<br />And then Ray is brutally beaten up. Nerese takes over the investigation, because she owes him from way back. But Ray won't tell her who did it. and she has to detect the hard way.<br />By now this book should be a mystery. But it refuses to. It is the story of the people living in the project, their hopes and aspirations. They will not make it out of that slum, and they know it. But still they keep trying. They act like mafia godfathers hoping the image will put them on a higher level. The children visit prison and the criminals  become superman. Yet at all times they have a clear understanding of their surroundings and the psychological facts of their diminished lives. <br />The author gives us an uncanny picture of people and locations but presents them almost like a stream of conscience. While it is fun to dig deeper here or there, the main attraction is in the swimming on the surface and let it all parade by.	2003-10-13

She is married to Derek, has two young sons and a 14-year old daughter Josie who gives her any amount of trouble. Lois supplements the family income by cleaning houses in the small neighboring village. Five houses per day of the week, with a total of five customers: Dr. Andrew Rix, the local physician, and his wife Mary; Professor Malcolm Barrett and his wife Rachel; Nurse Gilliam Surfleet; the Reverend Peter White, and Dallas Baer, whose wife Evangeline owns an art gallery.<br />And then there is Gloria Hathaway, age 38, who is murdered right in the beginning.<br />Who did it? The police are investigating, of course. But Lois, who knows the suspects and can snoop on them once a week, also gets going on this murder. She gets sidetracked only once, when her daughter gets involved with a suave but creepy teenager named Melvin Hallhouse.<br />Ann Purser does a magnificent job in developing the individual characters, presenting them in full three dimensions. Every one of her five suspects has a different occupation and curriculum vitae, and that makes the book even more interesting. For once, the police are not the bumbling nerds without feeling one normally reads about. But whenever somebody comes to a full stop, they must have some tea.<br />Slowly but inexorably the skeletons are dragged out of the closets until the truth is revealed. It is absolutely fascinating watching this process and being led astray while following the wrong scent.<br />This mystery is pure joy.	2003-10-04

He just left his native Pennsylvania and moved to Capri as secretary to the famous Scottish writer Rupert Grant. He becomes a member of the Grant household that includes the writer's wife Vera and his two research assistants Holly and Marisa - both of them young, beautiful and not too concerned about research.<br />Alex is approached by Vera, but rebuffs her. His heart is set on Holly who ignores him. Marisa goes after him, but that is not what Alex had in mind. Life at Villa Clio is rather complicated, especially as Grant's preferences are not entirely clear. In time, Marisa will break apart while Holly simply leaves and Vera stays behind to take care of aging Grant.<br />There must be a reason to this book, but I was unable to pin it down. The one really developed character is Alex's brother Nicky, who writes long (and touching) letters from Vietnam, where he is later killed. A major part of the book is name dropping, starting with emperor Tiberius and continuing to Curcius Malaparte (\\"La pelle\\"), Axel Munthe (\\"The story of San Michele\\") and every contemporary Brit writer you can think of. There is a wonderful supper dialog between Gore Vidal and Graham Greene. Later on, W. H. Auden is dragged into the story. All of these characters are presented  with cutting remarks about the other writers. One gets the feeling that the author simply wanted to show of.<br />Alex gets his Inspiration from reading and quoting Rainer Maria Rilke. Now there is a poet who must be interpreted by the reader and cannot be understood by reading him off the page. He would fit more with Young Werther than with a hick from Pennsylvania.<br />Did our lover graduate? I think not.	2003-09-27

He also finds out that her real name is Andrea Bellini, daughter of the local major mafia boss. And the Bellini gang is fighting it out with the Irish mafia. In between is Stephen Adashek of the FBI.

Suspicion points at Matthew Gain and at Peter Vincent Pethor, called Scout, the twin brother of P.D. Pethor. Both had been prosecuted for the murder but released due to lack of evidence.  Double Jeopardy: The two can not be tried again for the same crime.<br />For reasons not entirely clear, Detective Kerry Lake now goes fulltime after the perpetrators. Her road is not fascinating, surprising, or innovative. As a matter of fact, the whole procedure is extremely boring on the scale of \\"he said, she said, they all said\\", sprinkled with profound thoughts.

She tells her story of growing up in a foreign land. But she still remembers her daydreams from the land of her birth. She remembers that she had a little brother who drowned. And grandparents who stayed behind, while her mother could join them a few years later.<br />There are connections such as their life near the water, both in Viet Nam and in San Diego. There is repetition within the life of the refugees, such as the various fences, first in Viet Nam, then in the detention camp in Saigon, and finally in the housing complex in San Diego. The mother tries very hard to become an \\"American\\" without really knowing what that involves. The father works as a handyman and later as a gardener. But the foreign land breaks him in spirit and body. The little girl grows up and leaves to live on the east coast.<br />Obviously, the book has a large content of biographical remembrances. But it is never written in a maudlin tone, although the family shatters on these foreign shores. And though it is nobodies fault. The dreams of the orderly past among family and friends are just too strong and repetitive.<br />It is a wonderful story, told with a great heart and without complaints.	2003-09-11

Of this, the three voyages are well known and have been written up sufficiently. But Horwitz puts an interesting slant on the natives Cook encountered rather than the discoveries themselves. We learn about the Tahitians and their customs, the Maoris of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia, and the people of Tonga, of Hawaii, and the Aleuts of Unalaska. He acquaints us with Cook's main helper, the biologist Joseph Banks, and some of his officers, such as William Bligh of later mutiny fame, and John Ledyard who is still remembered in Connecticut (ironically, the town bearing his name now sports a gigantic native Indian gambling casino). <br />And so the islands were pristine and at peace. It is the author's aim to show us how this has changed into murder, thievery and disease. There are not many of the natives left and those he found were most anxious to forget about Cook. his discoveries and their aftermath. It would be wrong, of course, to blame all this on Cook. If it had not been for him, somebody else would have discovered the islands of the Pacific - and probably with the same results. <br />The conclusion: One should not supplant an original culture with one's own imported one. Both will suffer and there will never be a satisfactory result. Yet such action continues into our 21st century.	2003-09-02

We have James Resata, who went through his year in Viet Nam the hard way, and the gigantic Robert \\"Booboo\\" Canoza.<br />The play within the town of Rocksburg is also limited mostly to three neighboring families who are at each other throats almost daily. Once it is dog poop smeared on the neighbors door knob. Then it is threatening the neighbor with a knife.<br />The war in Nam is described in chilling detail. The neighborhood fights, however, develop into satire. That does not mean that they are not dangerous. But it means that the police officers have to summon all the accumulated wisdom of their many years on the force to keep the situations from exploding.<br />Mr. Constantine has everything under control.He gives us a picture - sometimes funny, and then brutally direct - of the cosmos of life in a small town.

He says that all references to the past are true. But, as they say in Italy: If it's not true, it surely is well invented.<br />Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu try to do what countless savants over the centuries tried in vain: Find the Holy Grail. The Vatican gets involved and, of course, Opus Dei. Jacques Sauniere, curator of the Louvre, is murdered early on. Apparently he was the grand marshal of the Priory of Sion, and they know where the Grail is. Robert and Sophie progress from anagram to double entendre riddles, on and on for over 400 pages.<br />The red herring going through it all is Mary Magdalene and the cult of the Sacred Feminine.

Each woman is shown her place in the orchestra. Their virtuosity is explained by their musical preference.

Her daughter Careme might be slender and others might be absolutely bulimic. Never you mind - FAT is the answer to healthy and satisfied living. Margarine and the likes are dirty words, products loaded with unnatural substances. And Jasmine, superb cook that she is, and blessed with an inquisitive and innovative mind, writes cook books to extol her love for FAT. Her size and weight tell her story.<br />Missy Cooperman, food editor,  cancels her contract because Jasmine's kind of cooking just is not \\"in\\" anymore. And husband Daniel takes off with a nubile, good-looking, young thing. But then things are put to right. A TV show on cooking needs a filler to fill the time element. So here comes Jasmine, letting loose on live TV with a tirade on FAT and against skinny people who are always afraid of gaining another ounce. Success beckons. Jasmine is now famous. And things straighten out on the domestic front, too, though not in any way you would expect.<br />This book is a slow starter. But then it gains speed and makes the most unbelievable case for FAT you ever encountered. I should mention that the author is a food editor for the Washington Post and liberally laces her tale with food items off the most sophisticated menus (no recipes, though). Read it and enjoy. If you are overweight you will feel much better afterwards.	2003-06-15

What's the purpose of the exercise? To quickly cash in on the new interest about Iraq? Some items, like the connections of the Bush leaguers to Middle East oil and gas, are interesting but hardly new or unknown.<br />To mention Prince Konoye as a Japanese organizer of a valid peace proposal is cute. But Vidal should have also mentioned that the prince had no standing within his own country and would not have gotten very far with his ideas.<br />Vidal writes that Roosevelt provoked Japan into the war by sending a nonsensical ultimatum. But that is only half the story. He should have checked out the situation paper Roosevelt wrote when Secretary of the Navy after World War I. In that paper he wrote:\\" Should Japan ever decide to attack the United States, that attack will take place at Pearl Harbor\\". Now we know why he assembled the whole Pacific fleet there. <br />But the main idea Vidal conveniently left out: Why were the US so very anxious to enter two world wars, despite considerable opposition in the population? We should start out with the fact that, in both cases, the \\"enforcer\\" was Winston Churchill.<br />A good part of the book is dedicated to the defense against critics, especially his \\"The Golden Age\\". I don't think I need to be brought up to speed on this. Furthermore, he seems to be in such a hurry to get things on paper that his justly celebrated polished use of the English language suffers badly.	2003-06-09

After building all kinds of contraptions, he finally comes close to something that works. Isabel, of course, helps him and the two grow close.<br />I will not divulge the ending because it is too beautiful to be messed with by an amateur. Mr. Gilling, who wrote the incredible \\"The Sooterkin\\", again uses his unique imagination and the beauty of his language to give us a novel that will stay in our memory for a long time and uplift our spirits.	2003-06-05

Why did he not just go and see him in person? Surely that would have put more meat on the book. It is long enough to answer the most pressing questions, but too short to really whet your appetite.<br />An interview is like a survey. You know the outcome before you even start. Did Pitt publish the whole interview, or just the parts that he liked? Did he just ask leading questions? Did he not want to bring up details about Saddam's use of poison gas because the answer could have been embarrassing? Here we have two men who know exactly what they want to say. So you only have to form the question correctly.<br />The book was published Sept. 25, 2002 - long before the war started. By now the war is over and the book becomes redundant. But it must be said that Ritter told the truth. Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, nor did it work on a nuclear device. People should be honest enough to give Ritter credit for this truth.	2003-05-31

At the center of the story is Consuela Castillo, of Cuban descent and then 24 years old. She has the most perfect female form, magnificent large breasts, an almost translucent white skin and black hair. She is just simply perfect, also in everything she does. This liaison lasts about a good year, stopping abruptly.<br />Some years later, Kepesh gets a call from Consuela, who needs his help and understanding. She has breast cancer, already lost her hair and will now lose one of her breasts.<br />Roth mainly writes about the juxtaposition of old age and youth. He finds that youth has its advantages, but they are not guaranteed. Consuela's youth and perfection are being destroyed, while Kepesh lives on. There is a lesson hidden here somewhere, and the lesson has to do with old age surviving. And that beauty is not reliable.	2003-05-30

The winds are the fault of Agamemnon; he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigeneia.<br />And so, throughout the book, they sit at Aulis, getting restless, producing major intrigues and nasty happenings. Croton, the fundamentalist soothsayer, wins out over Calchas, the diviner. The military are about to mutiny. Everybody gambles with the riches they are certain to obtain at Troy.<br />You could read the book as a supreme satire on modern times, replacing the Greek scoundrels with those now on the scene in Washington, DC. A roman a clef, so to speak.. Taken from that angle it is great joy, devastating and so well written.<br />But read as a modern rendition of the story of Iphigeneias on Aulis , putting a temporary slant on Euripides, it lacks greatness of spirit of the original.

But it brings absolutely nothing new, just rehashes what thinking people have been saying for a long time. What is worse: Kagan makes his pronouncements without really illuminating the background.<br />Does the Us use its superior power? Every president in the second half of the last century had his own war going. The results were usually abominable or ludicrous -Korea, Vietnam, Panama, Grenada, Somalia. Afghanistan is open-ended, and Iraq will wind up the same way. But in every case lately we were able to test new weapons. So there was a reason.<br />Europe was hiding behind the American power shield during the Cold War. Did it ever occur to Kagan that Europe did not feel threatened? That they rather wanted to spend their money on their people instead of buying  one-billion-dollar stealth bombers? <br />At present, President Bush is mad at France and Germany for not supporting his venture in Iraq. In both countries - and especially in Germany - the government was following the will of the people. You might call that \\"Democracy\\". In Spain, 73% of the people were against the war, yet Aznar went ahead anyhow. In Great Britain, the vast majority of the people was against the war and Tony Blair sent 45'000 soldiers to Iraq.

She is asked to work for a consortium that concerns itself with domestic violence. Tess is given six names of persons who have been killed in the last six years. None of the killings were solved. Tess is to find out if law enforcement did a sloppy - and presumably prejudiced - job.<br />So Tess goes to work, interrupting it only shortly to spend time with her boyfriend Crow. At first, nothing outrageous happens. She then teams up with retired Toll Road Police Officer Carl Dewitt. <br />The story is interrupted occasionally by the voice of the killer. <br />There just is no substitute for that vision thing when you want to reach conclusions that are not based on any known fact. And what is missing here is the kitchen sink. But then the author got a big medal from the mayor of Baltimore for writing so much about his city.<br />And the perpetrator became a mass murderer because he used to love Tess Monaghan.

Primarily, there is Ed Markey, whose girl friend Brenda helps from the outside. There is Brando Williams, a person of color. And so on. After a cold-blooded murder, they manage to break out.<br />The scene now shifts to the plan of breaking into a jewelry wholesale store, located in a super solid armory. The way in is through an old abandoned tunnel nobody knows about except the bad guys. The center of the tunnel had partially collapsed, though, and they have to dig their way through. They get to the jewelry store and load up on the expensive stuff. On the way back, the tunnel collapses on some of the bad guys . One must assume they got killed, but no time or verbiage is lost on that. Because the advance was so narrow, they left behind the sacks of loot. and backed out of the tunnel. They left behind all the jewelry. Why?? It takes another 100 pages or so to get them out of the armory and the mess as such. <br />The action taking place in the mid-west, it is interesting to speculate why Williams is so afraid of his white companions. This item is played over and over again. And there is the owner of a dance school, where Brenda signs up - and the owner immediately knows that all her ID papers were forged. How did she manage that?<br />I can understand some modicum of sympathy with a thief who gets away with it. But certainly not with a cold-blooded murder who does not even check if his friends are still alive. But that is one of the reasons why this is not a great book. The characters are one-dimensional and do not invite the reader to take sides. It has some nice ideas, but the execution is rather pedestrian, if not to say sloppy.	2003-04-23

The solution points to a foreign sailor - and there is a camp with foreigners seeking asylum nearby. <br />This sets the tone of the book. The hate of foreigners comes to the fore and begins to grow all the way to riots against them.<br />As so often, Mankell wrote a book that is only partially a mystery.

He became a trusted consultant to the shogun and Emperor Ieyasu  who admired his seafaring skills of navigation and also shipbuilding.<br />Williams was, by no means, the first European in Japan. Preceding him by about half a century were Spaniards and Portuguese. Mostly, they were Jesuits and Franciscans bent on converting the local population to the Catholic faith. Soon further English and Dutch traders arrived, and the continuous conflict between Catholics and Protestants was ready to begin.<br />Both the British and the Dutch established a Factory, to control trade and get rich quickly. The start capital for the British enterprise was supplied by the East India Company under Sir Thomas Smythe. Richard Cocks ran the Factory. He hired Adams for his invaluable connections to the Japanese `court. More than once Adams saved the future of the company and the lives of some of the English.<br />Milton shows us the surprise of the Westerners at the high culture of Japan. He describes that culture in quite some detail so that the British experience can be judged correctly in comparison with the home country. Milton also gives us most interesting details on the trading of the day and the miscalculation that happened too often. Not surprisingly he mentions the trade in nutmeg, a link to one of his previous books.<br /> The Factory was completely mismanaged and had to close on Dec. 24, 1623. At the same time the grandson of shogun Ieyasu started a campaigns against all foreigners, throwing them out of the country and effectively closing the door on Japan for the next 200 years.<br />Samurai William, who left a wife and daughter behind in England , started a new life with a Japanese family. He certainly was unique in being the only Westerner to achieve and maintain such influence over the emperorof Japan.By rights he is famous to this day. But Milton gives us the story of the English settlement and trading post, rather neglecting the story of William Adams. Also, he insists on constantly using the original English language of the time - even when it is not at all necessary to give flavor to the narrative. This gets to be very irritating.	2003-04-08

His many books attest to that. There is no doubt that he assembled many facts for the writing of this book. The extensive list of notes attests to that. He mentions  the opening of the seaway around Cape Horn in the 16th century as a decisive factor in the downward spiral of the Ottoman empire. The discovery of the New World destroyed the market for some of the Middle East goods. Land was lost, mostly to Russia. The Ottomans refused to learn from the West, fell hopelessly behind, and had their empire dissolve in 1920.<br />So - what went wrong? The author does not tell us. I expected a treatise on Islam versus Christianity, of the Middle East versus the West. Instead I get a long discussion on the introduction of watches and clocks in Egypt and Turkey. The subtitle of the book is \\"Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response\\". The impact is obvious - the Ottoman empire no longer exists. And the response seems to be that there was none.<br />The book seems to be an accumulation of articles on different subjects that do not get us to where we wanted to go.	2003-03-21

But whenever he believes that the reader needs a break, he inserts wonderful little stories that can happen to a federal judge. The solution to these stories is always more humane than legal. The audience probably will cheer, but any trial lawyer will cringe. <br />US District Judge Paul Devine tells us how he planned the robbery of the Federal Reserve Bank for zillions of dollars, and how he executed his plan. He had three accomplices:<BR> Dave Brody, a childhood friend, now a fireman and paramedic. He torches buildings on order.<BR> Charity Scott, a black lieutenant of security at the bank. Devine threw a case in her direction, later collecting on her gratitude.<BR> Trimble Young, white electrician at the bank.

His sidekick is Michiko, a rough and tumble Japanese woman of many native talents. But then there is colonel Ishigami, a throwback to the old samurais with their finely honed swords. He is after Harry and wants to slice off his head. He travels around the Asakusa district with a head box, in case he is successful.<br />The author gives us incredible descriptions of pre-war Tokyo, the artisans in the neighborhood, the geishas in the willow houses, the stuck-up military, and all the little folk teeming around.<br />And then we get to December 6. Harry clearly sees that any war can only be fought because and for oil. Japan cannot sustain a war, not having any oil. Harry cons the Japanese navy into believing that large quantities of oil are stored in Hawaii: Destroy it, and the US Pacific Fleet is grounded. The attack on Pearl Harbor fails to find or destroy these reserves and the Japanese leaders realize that the war is already lost.<br />All this sounds rather simple. But Mr.Smith painstakingly researched this book and made it authentic and believable.

They all are what you would call \\"damaged goods\\". The mystery at the center of the story is: Who killed Frank's parents who dies in the arson of their home. And what goes on with \\"The Sleeper\\", who lies in a waking coma at the local hospital. And who killed Ward Cassidy? <br />The story is told with great skill, lifting the vail of a snowy landscape only a little at a time, keeping you guessing. You get a feeling of floating along with it, never able to penetrate the various mysteries. In that respect, it is a great novel.<br />The solution to it all comes on the last few pages. It makes convoluted sense, but is far from satisfying. The novel might have more impact if it had been told straight forward, without Frank's ruminations.	2003-01-21
US	53030545	R2VMHPWECPB7FY	0743204735	660154931	Bush at War	Books	3	18	54	N	N	Bush redux	This book is a P. R. job in behalf of the President that I would not have expected from the revered journalist Bob Woodward. Bush, he of the steely look and the thin lips,  is the supreme leader. After all, he himself keeps mentioning that he is the Commander in Chief and the President; therefore he can say anything he wants to and does not have to explain anything. The bad guys in this piece are Rumsfeld and Cheney, who follow their own agenda ignoring Powell and Rice. Tenet is another bad boy.<br />After September 11, it was agreed that something drastic and highly visible had to be done immediately. \\"I want bin Laden, dead or alive\\", said the President. But how do you bomb the dickens out of a single person? A larger target was needed. How about the al Qaeda? Still not large and compact enough for a bombing campaign. OK - so let's go after the Taliban. They could not prove any connection to 9/11,  but they presented a chance to mess up a whole country. Besides, they were those uncouth people who would not let their women lacquer their fingernails (Laura Bush). <br />It took  a whole month to get even the semblance of anything going in Afghanistan. Even before 9/11, the CIA was given up to $200 million to pay off the Alliance. But now the real moneys hit the ground in stacks of $100 bills. Tenet put the cost at $ 1 billion. \\"Whatever it takes\\", said the President. At the same time Ashcroft declared that terror suspects would be dealt with, if necessary without a trial. Cofer Black from the CIA pointed out that people were going to die, some of them Americans. \\"That's war\\", Bush said. Powell saw that Bush was getting tired of talking; he wanted to kill someone. \\"I am a loving guy\\", he said. He opened every cabinet meeting with a prayer.<br />Tenet now asked that the CIA be given special power to use all instruments ever thought of, including deadly force. He wanted to start liaison with  questionable intelligence services, including rogue states such as Libya and Syria. There would be ruthless torture and worse. Bush said he understood.<br />Bush did not care for allies. He said \\"We may be the only ones left. That's OK with me. We are America\\". Ashcroft requested, in behalf of the FBI, special authority to wiretap. A Special Operations officer submitted a memo on the poisoning of food supplies in Afghanistan. They also started to build a case to show that al Qaeda was behind the 9/11 attacks. Ashcroft wanted a national neighborhood watch system. <br />Bush to New York business leaders: \\"I truly believe that out of this will come order in the world - real progressw to peace in the Middle East, stability with oil-producing regions. <br />\\"We need a victory\\", said Bush.<br />\\"I am not a textbook player. I am a gut player.\\"<br />So assets were inserted and they tried to get boots on the ground. Collateral damage is accepted. They started to incentivize and Americanize the war effort. A year later, the Taliban are regrouping. General Franks thinks that is good: \\"I have more targets to hit\\".<br />Most of all, it is amazing to see how Bush completely lost control over his cabinet members. Rumsfeld does whatever he feels like doing, including setting up his own intelligence force. Meanwhile, Tenet builds up his own army- called paramilitary - and illegally assassinates people in Yemen with armed Predator drones. Ashcroft locks up hundreds of Muslims throughout the US without charge, lawyers or habeas corpus. Wolfowitz  locks up hundreds of Afghans in Cuba under inhuman conditions. <br />What is our fearless leader up to? At the first sign of trouble and playing it no doubt from the gut, he hops on his plane and disappears into Nebraska. And Cheney? He disappears into bunkers of undisclosed locations, where he cannot be exfiltrated. On his first visit to New York, Bush had a motorcade of 55 cars. During the Genoa summit he stayed away from the world's leaders on a ship. An during the Prague summit, large parts of the city and the access roads were closed, while F-115 and F-116 circled overhead.<br />A President and Commander-in-Chief who is afraid of his own people and is willing to abrogate their constitutional rights. Whos purpose in life is the waging of war, no matter where or how.	2003-01-21

For the first part, Grisham must have taken notes for years to list all the things than can and will go wrong during the Christmas season. When Luther and Nora Krank (\\"krank\\" - get it?) decide to skip Christmas and to go on a cruise instead, one is tempted to cheer them on.<br />But wait!! You can't do that! You cheat on Santa Claus, and your name is a vast expanse of mud - if not worse - in the neighborhood and the whole town.<br />So Luther and Nora crank it up and prepare for Christmas after all. Getting there is not easy as it has to supply the humor for the book. A predictable ending. But would it not have been fabulous if Grisham had followed through on sailing into the sunset and had supplied a happy ending of as different sort?	2003-01-14

And there is Baudolino, youth of simple peasant stock, who is a stellar liar and linguist. This aptitude at languages brings him to the attention of Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa who will keep him nearby. Barbarossa later sends him to Paris to study, and Baudolino takes up with some strange characters. But soon he has a new goal to pursue: Finding the Holy Grail and to bring it as a present to Prester John, the fabled Christian ruler over the Orient. And so our hero goes traveling from West to East, finally returning to his native village. Barbarossa has drowned in the meantime, and Baudolino tells most of his story to the Greek historian Niketas Choniates.<br />As usual, Mr. Eco will have his fun, and that in various languages. He guides us through long philosophical discourses and tries to pull the reader's leg now and then. One has to get joy out of this in order to call this a wonderful, intelligent book that is so very worthwhile reading.	2003-01-04
US	53030545	R2WZPUIYTW4AIW	1582432228	600908147	The Shooting Party	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Landed Gentry	The people in this book come in three layers. We are mostly concerned about the top layer, including Sir Randolph Nettleby and his 1'000 acre estate, Lord Lilburn and his wife Olivia, Sir Ruben Hergesheimer, Count Tibor Rakassyi of Hungary, and so many, many more. They set the tone.<br />The lowest layer are the beaters for the shoot. They are farmers from the village. They are anonymous, and nobody talks to them. They are just the background noise. The exception is Tom Harker, occasional poacher.<br />In between those two layers are those who bow to the top and kick those below. For instance Glass, the head game keeper, and his son Dan. Or the maid Ellen.<br />And also somewhere in between is Cornelius Cardew. part preacher, compleat vegetarian, and convinced socialist. He seems too lightweight for an oracle, so his contribution to this novel is not quite clear.<br />But to come to the book: Mrs. Colegate has assembled a very large cast that fits into the Edwardian age. She gives us detailed biographies of each cast member and thus makes clear that they are not all the same. Mainly, some of the wives have their own private amusement with men not their husbands. Olivia holds hands with Lionel Stephens, while Arline Hartlip flirts with Charles Farquhar. Cicely, granddaughter of Minnie Nettleby, reaches for Count Rakassyi, but is still too young to do damage. Her brother Osbert meanders through the story with his pet duck. As we go along, the characters take on their own, distinct personality. Lionel Stephens rates the shoot as a competition. That is decidedly uncivilized, and Gilbert Hartlip hates him for it. The picture of this society fills in as we read along.<br />It has been said that the book describes the end of an era. I cannot find much indication of that. Also, everybody knew in October of 1913 that a major war was imminent, but this is not reflected. I believe it is too easy to use our knowledge of today to read something into that day before the Great War. Let us be honest and admit that the landed gentry is still with us, that they still have their shoots, and that their influence can still be felt. The more things change, the more they stay the same - as Voltaire said.<br />Nevertheless, it is an elegant and worthwhile book.<br />.	2002-12-31

His wife Priscilla leaves him. His son Kyle is a kiffing hippie. His daughter is off to college. Enters Rhonda, called Ronette, who is leaving her husband Clyde Hannaford to take up life with Lucky. They all live in a small town on the coast of Maine and spend their days fishing for lobster. <br />Lucky's boat is The Wooden Nickel, the name his father and grandfather already gave their lobstering boats. Ronette, part-time waitress at the Blue Claw, is the stern lady helping Lucky, who is in bad shape. An angioplasty for $26'000 still has to be paid for. Priscilla takes away his house but leaves him with the mortgage yet to be paid. His boat needs new equipment and his pickup isn't too healthy, either. <br />From the beginning, a Greek tragedy develops unremittingly. Almost every step Lucky takes brings a new disaster. His fight with other lobstermen almost lands him in jail. Taking up with Ronette promptly gets her pregnant. A whale destroys his lobster pots. But the other lobstermen do not fare that much better.<br />What makes this book so outstanding  is not just the telling of an alien way of life, but the way it is told with unlimited and surefooted humor. The characters come to life through their dialogs and actions. The language is awesome to behold. You will laugh with these people while wondering how such a hard and unrewarding life can be so funny.<br />Lucky's last stand is a modern reenactment of Moby Dick. He is now completely destroyed, yet there is still a shimmer of hope on the horizon.	2002-12-26

There are bodies around, for sure, right in the beginning of the book.  And somebody is in jail for doing the foul deed. But did he actually do it? Every 100 pages or so we get another character strongly pointing to yet another perpetrator. Those whose job it is to uphold the law sit by and let events pass them by. Nary a real investigation. And don't ever believe you could deduct the identity of the murderer by following the narrative. The whole thing is a surprise without the \\"I knew it\\" effect.<br />And if you believe that, at the very least, you have a novel with worthwhile characters and soaring language, forget about that, too. Besides the usual coupling 101, there is really nothing to get excited about. Except, maybe, sentences like \\"Everything else in life was just the feathers and hide on the foraging animal of love.\\" Or a situation like \\"What flashed very briefly from Genevieve toward Arthur was raw enough to be hatred. It seemed out of character, but in that look of loathing she'd found his enduring vulnerability, and Arthur flapped a hand against his side.\\" Lovely pictures like \\"Arthur's round sedan cruised to the curb\\", not to be outdone by \\"...the ripe turn of her behind, which he had always found the most becoming part of her anatomy\\".<BR> The author is even versed in the latest slang:\\"I don't think I done said that to her. Nnn-uhh..... I think the onliest one I gone on to like that was the other dude. And ain nobody seed him in years\\". No wonder they keep the guy locked up.<br />Waste neither time nor money on this, unless you need a door stopper.	2002-12-14

Salvo Montalbano, the local keeper of the law, brings his humanity and knowledge of the local customs to a vexing case: the victim - engineer Silvio  Luparello -  of murder most foul was not blown away by a lupara, but ostensibly died in the performance of a manly occupation.<br />Open and shut case. Delicious, but not true.

He is very human, talking to mafia bosses and other miscreants. He clearly knows who has the power and uses his good connections to his advantage. <br />The inspector works out of the little Sicilian town of Vigata - a pseudonym for the birthplace of the author. No wonder happenings sound so right and the dialogs are so perfect. Mr. Camilleri is already in his seventies. Maybe that explains the deep knowledge of land and people around him.<br />The mystery itself reads like something one would imagine to happen in Sicily. But the rather unusual twist to it is the dating back to the American invasion of Sicily. That account alone - shown from the fishermen's observation of the approaching GIs - is great fun to read.<br />Get the book and learn about the real Sicily.	2002-11-19

As the book opens in 1935, Briony is 13 years of age, and her sister Cecilia is 23. Robbie Turner, who works in the estate gardens, becomes the lover of Cecilia. The first part of the novel shows us the participants in minute detail, examining past and future aspiration to form complete character studies. The summer day starts rather bucolic, but quickly starts to disintegrate as personalities clash and grate on each other. At night, one of the young female guests is raped, and Briony points her finger at Robbie. Thus Robbie is convicted and sentenced to two years in jail.<br />The second part of the book takes place in May of 1940. Cecilia has become a registered nurse, and Briony just started as a learning nurse. Robbie is part of the British Expeditionary Force, trying to get to Dunkirk and back to England. The description of this retreat is an incredible piece of literature. The reader feels like he is there, suffering through the combat and choking on its details. One  is tempted to believe that the author writes from personal experience. Shortly thereafter the author describes the life of a training nurse during war time. Again, he gives us details that are fascinating and gives us endless respect for these caring women.<br />...Warning! This novel is written incredibly well as to imagination,<BR>language and style. It may well spoil for you many books you read thereafter, making them look superficial, shallow and sloppy.	2002-11-03

With so much money involved - whom can you trust? Where to find Bowling? It becomes a ?Third Man? game, until Abelard secures the help of Bowling?s girl friend Lucy Mary McIver, who seems to work for the U.S.State Department. Bodies begin to pile up. Bowling is found, then lost, then found again, then lost again, and so on. In the end it all sorts out, of course.<br />This book is written rather badly. Just about every third sentence ends with a question mark. The many asides are not helpful, nor is the constant reference to Abelard as half black. The language does not use the easy going humor of the Harpur and Iles books. This is the first of a projected series featuring Abelard. Let us hope that things improve.	2002-06-05

Cheka (secret service) official Roy Rolkin asks for the transfer of his friend, Inspector Constantin Vadim, from his home grounds of Murmansk to Moscow. There, Vadim should find a serial murderer who kills and carves up young women. He is placed in the worst possible district of the city, completely bombed out and destroyed,without water or electricity, and the meager population reduced to fighting for the barest survival. Slowly and energetically, he burrows his way into this underground of absolute human misery. He finds that the promised amnesty for the anarchists brings a one way ticket to Siberian hell once they surrender. Dr. Imogen Sheperd, the American supervisor of the program, is more interested in the luxury life the party bosses lead in another part of town. Vadim is also interested in the fate of his ex-wife Lydia, the anarchist commander of a regiment of women, and of their son Misha. He visits the buildings where bands of teenage robbers and murderers congregate, and goes into the underground passages where Father Alexander celebrates his libidinous church. Nothing ever is what it seems to be. The former enemies surface as top party officials of the new government. The people at the bottom of the ladder are persecuted as before, tortured and murdered. Everything has changed, and yet nothing is different.<br />Mr. James published this book in 1997 when Jelzin was in power. His previous book, ?the Fortune Teller?, places Vadim in the hopeless harbor scene of Murmansk. His next one, ?Vadim?, plays in 2?020 and will be published shortly. A fourth one, ?the Benefactor?,  is scheduled for next year. Mr. James wrote the 10-part series on Russia for PBS. He also published a book on modern Russian history. To compare the present book to ?Gorki Park? does it an immense injustice. The author uses theform of a mystery to tell us about Russia, and he comes through very loud and clear.<br />Mr James makes a very strong point: The lot of the Russian citizen is a sad one.

This gives the author the chance to write about it in great detail within a slim volume. He does an admirable job in bringing Mozart back too life for us.<br />Mr. Gay puts repeated emphasis on Mozart?s dependence on his father Leopold. Although Leopold recognized his son?s genius, he kept him under firm and strict control. Part of this was founded in society?s approach to the upbringing of children. But another large part was the fact that young Amadeus became the money making machine that kept the family financially afloat. Mozart himself went from subservience as a child  to absolute disavowal of his father when he became of age. The connection to his sister Nannerl , who was a good musician but not a genius, was more neutral. Young Amadeus had quite the sex drive. But when he married Constanze . he finally found somebody who cared for him. This poor woman outlived him by about 40 years.<br />Mozart was basically a lonely man. As a child, he met - and worked for - kings and emperors. He was aware of, and corresponded with, the great musicians of the time. One of the contacts with the people around him was his membership in the Freemasons. His life was composing, day and night.<br />The author does not give short shrift to Mozart?s music but, thanks be to him, does not spend time on telling us what he personally thinks of one piece of music or another. He accounts for all the compositions and mentions the progress Mozart made. He does give special attention to the operas, writing a short and most helpful resume of all the major ones. Librettist da Ponte receives a place of honor, and Schikaneder an honorable mentioning. Mozart loved to compose operas and is given full credit. He was versed in staging and was a major contributor to any presentation. But he was not a happy person. He loved to spend money, and his music did not bring enough income. He did not like Vienna, where he spent so manyyears. He came to dislike his father, who held him responsible for his mother?s death.<br />Reading this book, you feel a great affinity for this young genius. And you ponder, of course, what would have happened if----------he had lived longer.	2002-05-04

James Singleton gets to money and gold first, and the computers are too hot to handle. <br />This book does not really have a plot, but rather a convoluted story line. The not so bad guys get killed off first. Some of the really bad ones survive to the end. Eddie is connected to the Italian mafia. Singleton is being helped by the Russian mafia. The FBI and the Federal Witness Protection Program enter the fray, as do two local detectives. Those two actually do little detecting; they just watch events roll by them. The FBI does not do much, either. But, of course, they know everything. How does an author get out of this mess? By having all participants meet for the last glorious shootout. Whatever is not clear by then, gets killed in the last pages.<br />An amusing book, but not a brain puzzler.	2002-05-04

Ambassasor, Murderer	Sickles chose the beginning of his career with care by joining Tammany Hall. He worked with fervor in their behalf  and gave substantial help towards the election of President Buchanan.  While in New York, he stayed in the household of Lorenzo da  Ponte  and seduced his married daughter, Maria Bagioli. Thinking twice about it, he went after Maria?s  more delicious daughter Teresa, age 15.  The archbishop of New York married Dan and the visibly pregnant Teresa. The child was called Laura.<br />Using his Tammany connections, Sickles got elected to the US Congress. There he was active as ever as well as successful in handing out favors, with the help of president Buchanan. He had a grand lifestyle in Washington and, when in need of funds,  took them from money entrusted to him. Being so busy, Dan neglected his wife Teresa. And Teresa found herself a lover: Burton Key. When Sickles became aware of this liaison, he got hold of Key and shot him to death. During the ensuing court proceedings, he had the then novel ides of pleading ?temporary insanity? and was acquitted.<br />And now the Civil War started, and Dan was truly in his element. He raised a brigade of Germans and Irishmen in New York,became a brigadier general and was off to do battle. His big moment came a few years later during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg. He pulled his troops out of position against the orders  of General Meade and got creamed, although the Union won the battle on the third day. Dan also caught a cannonball in his right leg, which was amputated and sent to Washington, where it can be seen nowadays at the Walter Reed Hospital.<br />After the war, Dan was appointed Military Governor of North and South Carolina, and some years down the road ambassador to Spain. There he married a second time, Teresa having died of tuberculosis. At the same time, he made trips to Paris, to console the former Queen Isabella II of Spain.<br />Returning to New York - without his new family - he was elected to one term of Congress and was then appointed chairman of the New York State Monuments Commission. And, again, money was missing from the till..<br />Dan Sickles died in 1914 at the age of 95. His first love always was the army. On a parallel track, he loved women to his dying days. But he was disaster upon his family. He reconciled with Teresa, but never let her come close to him again. His daughter Laura died of neglect and alcoholism. He did not talk to his second wife for 27 years and hardly acknowledged the two sons from that marriage. Dan Sickles was a famous man, but certainly not a nice one.<br />Keneally usually writes his historical books like novels, in a beautiful poetic style. But so many minute details are known about the life of Daniel Sickles that he had to write this book in a more reportorial style. Also, it would have been a very nice touch  by the publishers to include some photographs that surely are available.  It is a wonderful book and well worth reading.	2002-04-27

Much of it is familiar, of course, because the history of it is so very recent. There are no stunning revelations, as Mr. Klein was a journalist and not a member of the president?s inner circle. Yet he gives us some very interesting perceptions. One of them is the very major, but almost hidden, role Hillary Clinton played in her husbands decisions. He shows us a president who could argue back and forth throughout the night, but then tenaciously stick with it once he made up his mind. Mr. Klein reminds us of the many achievements of this presidency that were never properly acknowledged because of the overriding preoccupation with Clinton?s personal scandals. And he also shows us  how quickly George W. could mess up what took years to accomplish. While Clinton was battered from all sides (especially Newt Gingrich and Kenneth Starr), he did manage to take care of politics and help the more unfortunate of our citizen. <br />Mr. Klein writes a reporter?s language. He presents us with a well researched book that tries to put a more favorable light on Bill Clinton?s presidency. He has done a noteworthy job.	2002-04-21

The author uses  the life of Schnitzler as a hook on which to hang his tales  of the Victorian bourgeoisie. <br />Mr. Gay discusses the moral  atmosphere during the 19th century and shows us that the bourgeoisie was not as constipated  as they are claimed to be. Next he discusses  the Victorian family, their religious habits as well as their culture and work.  Shaping the century is the fact that it was relatively free of wars and thus gave people a chance to better themselves in peaceful times.  But probably the most important factor was the arrival of the industrial age. The railroads not only created riches for some bourgeois, but enabled  the speedy transport of goods, just as the telegraph  cut down on the transmittal time of news.  Especially the second half of the 19th century was a time of upheaval, with people trying to find their place in a rapidly changing environment. This continued long into the 20thh century before it settled down to a more comfortable pace. <br />Mr. Gay had previously written  a five-volume explanation of  the bourgeois experience in the 19th century. I must assume that his research for such a massive undertaking served as the basis of  the present book. Unfortunately, too many authors recycle their leftover research. That is definitely not the case here. The writing is fresh and of new interest.	2002-04-21

But then he backs up his judgment with a detailed history of this president. Mr. Auchincloss is not afraid to add his own interpretations, and some of them you may not want to agree with. But they are always well reasoned and therefore welcome. <br />Was TR an imperialist? By modern definition of the term one would answer in the affirmative. He condoned the taking of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the Philippines and the digging of the Panama canal. He built up the fleet and had it sail around the world to demonstrate America?s new might. But he also engineered the peace treaty between Japan and Russia.<br />Was TR a bully? Most decidedly so. He fought hard for what he believed in - and never forgave an insult. But his conduct was built on a basis of honor and chivalry, trying to do what he believed would be best for the people. He took on the likes of Morgan, Gould and Fish because he believed them to be detrimental to the people?s welfare. In the end he outlived himself and his policeman?s ethic.<br />Mr. Auchincloss gives us a stunning, vivid portrait of this great president, in clear and precise language. I highly recommend this book.	2002-04-21

Mr. Lewis' book comes in two parts. One is the physical life of Dante, the other his major works &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; and &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;. Neither one of the two parts is entirely satisfying.<br />The author describes Dante's upbrining in Florence, his political activities there and subsequent banishment for life. Dante spent the better part of his life in exile. He travelled from city to city asnd from benefactor to benefactor. But, more often than not, these travels are not fleshed out to give us a clearer picture of the poet's actual life. Interesting is his celebrated yearning for Beatrice, although he struck her from his life rather quickly after she died in 1290 (Dante was then 25 years old). His political activity in Florence, including participation in some battles, is covered thoroughly, and so are the murderous fights between the Ghibellines and the Guelphs. The author also shows us in excellent detail the influence of the papacy and of some of the foreign powers.<br />The second half of the book is about the &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;. Mr. Lewis takes us through every circle of hell, names names and, at times, the deeds that got them there. There are no other explanations besides short descriptions of the circles. It seems that all the nice folks Dante had an axe to grind with wound up in hell. The author does not give us a clue. As it is, it has little bearing on the actual life of the poet.<br />If you want to read this book, be wide awake and attentive. The writing is so dry, the pages smoke when you rub them together. But I can see how it can be frustrating, or even confusing, for an author who knows so much about Dante to set it down in 200 pages.	2002-04-05

They are: Timing, Beauty, Cheek, Brilliance, Gaiety, Grace and Charm. The author tries to tie in these virtues with short biographies of, mostly French, cocottes of the 19th century. This simply does not work, no matter how much source material is dragged into the book. Besides, I have trouble describing Klondike Kate or Marlene Dietrich as courtesans. Besides, Ms. Griffin uses rather harsh and basic language, although she is given to occasional flights of lyrical fancy that can evoke a chuckle or two.<br />Any courtesan having all of the required seven virtues would be Wonder Woman. And the main item missing here is CLASS.	2002-04-04

The author gives us, in excruciating detail and high water scatology, the lowdown on the workings of a restaurant kitchen. He has lived through it for the last twenty-odd years and spares us no detail of his apprenticeship. He has high praise for his Ecuadoran and Mexican helpers because they know their business, are always on time, never call in sick, and work like mad men 17 hours a day for at least six days a week. And that at lousy pay. He tells us about a close-knit fraternity that lives outside civilization as we know it. And, of course, he mentions all kinds of food, their ingredients and the purchase thereof, and their preparation. At the end of the book, you feel that a good chef does the humanly impossible - and solely for the love of food.<br />It is a very, very funny (and Xrated) book that gives you a lot of respect for what goes on behind the facade of that nice restaurant and how much work and knowledge is involved to put that plate in front of you.	2002-04-04

Mr. Reston tells the tale of the Third Crusade in fascinating detail. Three years of research are the building blocks. Interpreted discourse and liberal quotes from the Bible and the Koran are the glue that holds it together. The author also gives us extensive background on the European power struggles that are part of this crusade. And he follows the two heroes - Richard the Lionhearted and Sultan Saladin - to their bitter end.<br />Richard had to fight on may fronts. His arch enemy turned out to be Philip Augustus, king of France, who pulled out of the crusade and went home. A major support fell apart with the death of Frederick Barbarossa, Holy Roman Emperor of Germany.  Back home, Richard's brother John tried to take over his domains in England, while Philip tried the same in France, Trying to counter all these threats was Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother and former queen of both France and England. In Palestine, Richard was opposed by the likes of Conrad of Montferrat, Reginald of Chatillon, and Guy of Lusignan.<br />Richard was a man of battle, never shrinking from a fight and always ready to pounce on his enemies. Saladin, on the other hand, was the quiet tactician who tried to outfox the crusaders. In the end, Saladin with his simple life style won over Richard who decides against capturing Jerusalem and wanted to conquer the riches of Egypt instead.<br />The sympathies of Mr. Reston clearly are with Sultan Saladin. And there is, of course, a very strong parallel to today's situation in the Near East. I assume that the author had this in the back of his mind when he wrote this very fascinating book.	2002-03-14

Foremost is Jack Lamb (and his girl friend Helen), who worked his way into a super trophy mansion and a remarkable collection of fine art, most of it stolen and now for resale. On a lower rung is Tony Towler, and also our friend Ralph Ember.<br />Let the fun begin with a heist the police had been advised about. It turns problematic when Doug  Webb?s son Martin is killed by Harpur. Webb needs revenge. Who blew the whistle? Maybe Denise, who is also friendly with Helen and could be the messenger go-between. She has to be eliminated. It definitely could be Lamb, but he is a few numbers too large to just blow away. No such problem with Towler, who quickly gets killed. But who can trust anybody?  Saquhar-Perry plans a new heist at a bank. So let?s plant some desinformation to make sure the good guys are in the wrong place. Feed it to Towler, who will pass it on to Lamb, who will then inform Harpur. Towler can?t be found (remember, he is dead). You have to find a substitute. But who can you trust? What information can you trust? As a matter of fact - can Ember trust Webb? Can Saquhar-Perry trust Ember? Can anybody trust anybody?<br />The author has written a tightly constructed mystery. After introducing the actors, he starts to apply the vise and squeezes the last bit of thought out of them. The result is a cliff hanger not to be missed. I just wonder why it took ten years for this book to make the trip from England across the Atlantic. We desperately need more books of this caliber!	2002-03-14

He can feel like a pessimist, or like an optimist, but can never tell the two apart.  Saeed is an Arab. When Israel conquered part of Palestine, he did not flee but stayed behind to become an Israeli citizen. That did not help him much - Arab remains Arab. <br />The book is a humorous allegory, wrapped around everyday Arab life,  with a bitter nucleus of Israeli oppression. Like Voltaire?s Candide, Saeed believes that this is the best of all worlds. To him it seems quite natural that the occupying forces arrest people in the middle of the night for no reason, that they deport them, that they blow up houses, and that they devastate whole villages. After all, they won the war, and everything - and everybody - now belongs to them. There are those Arabs who want to retaliate immediately. But they are told that the tree is not loved for its flowers,  but for its fruit. After all, it took them close to two hundred years to throw out the crusaders. Saeed is the simple soul who sees what goes on around him, but cannot understand why it is so. The bitterness comes with the explanation.<br />Mr. Habiby wrote a devastating satire. His own life paralleled that of Saeed: he was an Arab in Israel, even a member of the Israeli parliament. He wrote this book almost 30 years ago. It is still valid.	2002-03-14

For the first two months, he just sits in his cubicle with nothing to do, because nobody has the time to give him an assignment. But then he goes to work on a project that is acknowledged to be impossible to complete. But the Air Force wants it, and the company wants the money it brings in. And now the humor really starts - with Zack?s co-workers such as Meissner, the project manager, ?A Boy named Hsu?, constantly worrying Kushner, cynical Shopper Jim, and Frenchman Eduard Boulot, who dreams of owning a book stall on the Seine. Enter also a love interest, and doing good with coaching six year old boys in soccer (something that includes irate parents). Everybody does his own thing. Some of them study law on the side, because that?s where the money is. One of his co-workers even runs his own company right out of his cubicle - and everybody knows it. The Air Force is without a clue, being presented with wonderful slide shows and lots of double talk..

Rather, it is a diatribe against other historians who described Philip V as weak, mentally disturbed and a disaster for this country. The author does not see it that way.<br />Mr. Kamen explains that Philip suffered from manic depression and bipolar disorder. Could that be another expression for mentally unfit? While the king spent days and weeks in bed, screaming loud and messing up himself and his surroundings, the author claims that he was still of a composed mind and absolutely lucid. Philip's second wife, Elizabeth Farnese, took over the command of the kingdom, saying that she only acted on the instructions of her husband. Do we want to believe her? What we can believe is that, during Philip?s first marriage to Marie Louise of Savoy and even beyond, the affairs of Spain were run by the king's grandfather, King Louis XIV of France. Under Elizabeth Farnese, the French influence lessened and was supplanted by an Italian hegemony. <br />Given this very strong foreign influence, and the considerable power still exercised by the Spanish grandees, one could question whether or not it really mattered that much if Philip was always lucid or bipolar. Mr. Kamen may have lost the basis for his argument.	2002-02-23
US	53030545	R25XYD7WBGG0WF	1859846181	463609053	The Assassination of Lumumba	Books	5	21	22	N	N	The Story of a Death Foretold	...Five stars  for the incredible amount of research that went into the writing of this book.. It is a book that was necessary and long overdue. For the first time we have clear proof of all the players, what they did and when they did it. Lumumba was assassinated by Tshombe?s police, with the help of Belgian officials. They can not any longer deny it.<br />De Witte depicts Lumumba as a fierce nationalist  but denies that he was left-leaning. That claim may have to be investigated further. Lumumba did have strong connections to Russia and surely there is a reason why the university in Moscow for foreign students is named \\"Lumumba University\\". There is no doubt, though, that he presented himself as a socialist.<br />The author repeatedly mentions that Lumumba's rise to the presidency of the Congo was the story of a death foretold. Western governments repeatedly sais that Lumumba had to be \\"eliminated\\". But the interpretation was left open: did they mean \\"physically\\" or \\"politically\\"? It is interesting to note that it took them almost seven months to kill him. An assassin hired by the Belgians was called back. The CIA delivered a box of poison that was never used. Why this delay, when an invented illness would have been faster and politically more acceptable?<br />De Wittte also claims that Lumumba had to fail with his government because he lacked a functioning army and police force to back him up. What he never examines, unfortunately, is the fact that Belgium withdrew its administrative apparatus upon independence. And they had never trained any natives to be administrators. On July 1, 1960, The Congo had only a handful native lawyers, physicians, or even people with a higher education. Under those conditions you cannot run a country (you have to know where the telephones are). <br />Because of this book, Belgium officially apologized to the Congo ... Mr. de Witte could hardly wish for a better acknowledgement of his work.	2002-02-23

They overcome the frozen heights of the Pamir mountains and the unrelenting heat of the Gobi desert. Many are the towns they visit on the way and the people they meet. It is a fascinating travelogue along the old Silk Road, through regions barely known even today.<br />The leader of the caravan is the Venetian merchant Montefoschi. He is accompanied by the monk  Vartan, an illustrator of religious books,  and the thief  Hovsep. Later, he is joined by Arnaud de Roanne, the healer, and, towards the end, by Jebe, the Mongol warrior.<br />The main thrust of the book is not the travelogue, but the men who make up the caravan. The author digs into their innermost lives, turning them inside out to get hold of their dreams and their aspirations - and how they play against actual life during this voyage. These are all condemned men.<br />I would say that this is very much a French book, examining the psychology of the main characters against the backdrop of actual occurrence. It is a challenging book, well worth reading.	2002-02-23

The main action plays  seventeen years after all of them first got married. By now they should all be dead of various failures of internal organs. <br />All this action is repetitive throughout the book. Furthermore, the characters change in mid stream.

Everybody hunts for the body, but can find only a finger. Everybody knows that Ronny is guilty of killing and dismembering his father, but cannot prove it.  This keeps going until the very end of the novel, and then we are given a rather implausible solution to this mystery. As such, it is well written. But some of the main characters surely don't make sense, vacillating back and forth, changing our perception of them. <br />This book comes in two parts. One of them is the mystery mentioned above. The other part is the author's ranting about the downfall - the \\"dumbing\\" - of America, as seen in a small town in the plains of the Midwest. We are in the 1980s, and all the industry in town has come to a grinding halt. The factories are in ruin, and the people are unemployed. How come? Mr. Collins explains that we have forgotten to use our hands to build things, but instead use them to stuff our mouths. His book is a string litany of fast food chains such as Denny's, Burger King, MacDonalds, etc. Hardly anything else goes on in town but eating and drinking. Even the local newspaper is folding for lack of news. America disappears into a heap of rust.<br />It seems to me that Mr. Collins - a writer from England - has made it a bit too easy for himself. He condems the negative side and expects it to continue. He does not grant us the right of a positive side. After all, when we make a mess, we also manage to get out of it again.	2002-01-30

The result is a meticulous account, on an almost daily basis, of Marie Antoinette's life. We learn that she was a pleasure loving, friendly woman. But we also learn that she was not the brightest and could hardly read or write. And that is how the little girl from Austria entered womanhood as the dauphine and queen of France. Being that l'Autrichienne was the first strike against her. The second was her unquestioning obedience to her mother Maria Theresa, the empress of Austria,  and later to her brother emperor Joseph II. And the third strike was that she would not comprehend what agitated the people of France. As we all know: three strikes, and you are out.<br />A writer chooses a subject for a biography because it interests him and because he likes it. That induces prejudice that has to be avoided. How did Mrs. Fraser fare? She obviously likes Marie Antoinette very much, and her prejudice shows. When bad news cannot be avoided, she tries to qualify them. Did Marie Antoinette have a love affair with Count Fersen? Most probably - but then we have no eye witnesses. Did she spend profligately on the Petit Trianon and on St. Cloud? Yes - but then that was customary. Did she mess up in politics?  Yes - but then she was politically uneducated. Did she come on too strong in behalf of her Austrian relatives? Yes - but then it did not get her anywheres. All this tilts the tenor of the book. Hand in hand with this go sins of omission that could make  Marie Antoinette look really bad.<br />The queen of France started out on good terms with the French people and only her Austrian provenance was held against her. And then everything began to deteriorate. It started in earnest with the pamphlets describing her as a drunken wanton. Were they so wrong and freely invented? Where there is smoke, there is fire. Maybe the affair with Count Fersen was not quite that secret. Nor her closeness to the Princesse de Lamballe and the Duchesse de Polignac. L'Autrichienne did interfere in the politics of ther husband, the king. And she did promote Austrian interests whenever she was asked to. The sums of money she spent were enormous in a time when France was practically bankrupt. Thus Marie Antoinette finished her life as the most hated person in the country. She was a flighty person, with little education and not much brains. Maybe that explains some of it.<br />Antonia Fraser gives a somewhat lopsided account of her subject up to the time the revolution took form. After that, Marie Antoinette's fate is out of her hands and the narrative can continue with straight forward history. And that she does well.	2002-01-30

It was the beginning of 1945, the allied troops were poised to enter the German mainland, and the heavy fighting was just about over. The medic rolled all the way through Germany into Saxony, where his unit served as occupation force after May `45.<br />As a result, Mr. Litwak cannot tell us much about combat. But he tells us a lot about the comrades in his platoon. Some of the tension stems from hate of Blacks and Jews. The amusement consists of reams of fraeuleins and mademoiselles. For further relaxations, a few German prisoners of war are shot and killed, and villages are plundered on the way through.<br />Mr. Litwak writes that he did not condone these criminal acts. On the other hand, he never reported them. May his conscience be clear and untroubled now, 55 years later.	2002-01-19

He starts with Alfred Corbin who represents the British empire as ADC in a tiny Kenian town near the border to Tanganyika. The town had been founded by immigrants from India, who had come to East Africa in the second half of the 19th century. They became traders and, over the generations, some of them prospered. They lived through two world wars, married within their community, lived within their faith - and did not mix with the indigenous population. When independence came in the 1960s, they were destroyed by the new native powers.<br />Thus the author gives us the history of the Indian settlements, practically from their beginning to their aslmost destruction. His main characters shift from Corbin, to the Indian shopkeeper Pipa and his family, to the expatriate Englishman Gregory, destroyed by the new nation. There is hardly a mention of the native Africans.<br />Vassanji gives us a fascinating history of the people that Kenya, to this day, neglects and despises. I am very glad that this book was written to resurrect the Indian immigrant, whose trading really built these nations commercially.	2002-01-19

At age 16, he is drafted and sent to the Isonzo battlefront in the Dolomites. He deserts and wanders east, coming to a stop in the Ukraine. There, he spends the next twenty years on a communist colchose before returning to his small village in Carinthia. Together with Else, he moves to a lonely cottage where he works as a game keeper. It is now 1938.<br />Germany is under Nazi rule, and the clouds drift towards Austria. The first messenger is Kurt, Else's cousin, who just returned from a two-year stay in Berlin. We now get the first run-ins between the former Bolshevik and the Nazi. More and more events come to a head. Austria becomes part of Germany, and Kurt shows up in the uniform of a SS officer. Else, guarding her own secrets, is placed in the middle between  the two combattans.<br />Wray wrote a magnificent book, not painting Oskar all good, nor Kurt all bad. It is a most plausible story that shows in clear and absolutely accurate detail what actually happened in those days. It is a textbook of history enveloped in a gripping story. That Wray makes mistakes in the naming of the SS ranks can easily be forgiven.<br />This is a book for the younger generation to learn from, and for the older generation to rediscover. But I do wonder if there was a purpose to placing the action in Carinthia, probably the only western region nowadays under the government of a dedicated Nazi (Joerg Haider).	2002-01-18

And its founder, Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer, will be pronounced to be a saint of the church any day now. While I am familiar with some of the tenets Mr. Gill mentions, others have to be taken on faith or as exaggerations. <br />The book, as a mystery, has a tendency to move slowly and in convoluted ways.

Francisco Dias, the father, works his big farm in Portugal with the help of his many sons. He drives them out of bed at 4 in the morning and there they are, shovelling manure. Only the youngest, Walter, refuses. He won't shovel. And he gets away with it. Walter and his teenage daughter are the main characters of this book. She pines for her father, whom she has rarely ever seen. He keeps circling the globe, sending letters with beautifully drawn birds in them. Everybody wonders why he draws these birds. And everybody talks about his army blanket that he uses to sleep on, either alone or with female company. Everybody is shocked about this. But when his daughter grows up and spends her nights around town, nary an eyebrow is raised. Everybody has either beautiful or bad thoughts, and the landscape is poetic, too. This has nothing to do with a Portuguese dirt farmer. Nor with a normal human condition.<br />I just don't get it.	2001-11-26

Keneally uses this ploy to show us a group of 26 men who spend many months in complete isolation during arctic darkness. The men have different backgrounds and different professional specialties. An uneven lot, if there ever was one. But, of course, they completely depend on each other. They must work as a tight community - and we await Keneally's thoughts of this &quot;experiment&quot;. He introduces Victor Henneker, a journalist who has collected unsavory facts on people he meets, including most of the members of the expedition. Henneker gets killed, and his notes now become public knowledge. How do the explorers deal with what they now know about each other? Do they look at them now with different eyes? Most important: do they still trust each other?<br />Keneally gives us a fascinating portrait of people under the stress of a predicament they cannot flee. A fascinating book.	2001-11-26

These he spends in a coal mine near the arctic circle. After his release, he spends the next twenty years in the small village of Myshkino on the Volga, where everybody calls him Shurik.<br />The book opens on the 80th birthday of Shurik. A good time to reflect on the past and to think, perhaps of the future. Shurik tells us about his years in the coal mine and his work mates, who become inseparable friends. In the worst of adversity, they are there for each other, united especially in their disdain for the communist regime. At times, the story sounds like Solzhenitsyn's &quot;A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;. Survival becomes a matter of attitude, and the author describes it well. It is not so much the brutality of the camp as the spiritual emptiness of thousands of days with only the same manual labor.<br />In the village of Myshkino, Shurik teaches English at the local school. He opens the children's eyes to the world beyond and teaches them how to think on their own. Shurik is much beloved by everybody and, on this birthday, he is content. It is a truism that, as life goes on, one tends to repress the bad things but to revive the good ones.<br />Mr. Booth has written a beautiful book, full of charm and loving detail. The language is superb, and the flow of the story riveting. Maybe he gets a bit too sugary at times, but that can be overlooked.	2001-11-20

The leaders of the group all have biblical names, and we get to know them quite well, following their peccadillos from year to year. By the end we know a lot about baboons, without having been subjected to a lot of academic finetuning.<br />But the main part of the book deals with the young scientist and his never ending curiosity about the world around him. We get intimate glances at the Masai and the Kikuiu tribes, whom he befriended. We go with him to Uganda only days after the overthrow of Idi Amin. We look for the mountain gorillas of Ruanda (and get a short lecture on Dian Fossey). And we visit southern Sudan, where nobody in right mind would go.<br />The author never looses his humor, even after getting ripped off time and again, nor when he is made to defecate on the main street of a Sudanese village with the whole population watching, or when a herd of elephants congregates in front of his tent. <br />No matter what hits him, he finds a reason to laugh about it.

On his castle in Hungary, Henrik has waited for 41 years for the only and closest friend of his youth, Konrad, to return. And now Konrad has arrived. The book gives us the dialog between the two men, starting with friendship, truth, loyalty and honesty. Then comes the split: there are truths that are not reality. Reality is that Konrad as a young man, was very poor and had to seek support from Henrik's family. One day, he suddenly leaves and now returns after 41 years to answer his friend's questions. The dialog now changes from friendship to passion, to envy, and finally to hate.<br />What is the sense of life? The author describes in direct language how this sense can change - depending on truth and reality. He shows the fascinating bridge from friendship to hate. Henrik's truths are turned inside out. Instead of reality he now sees the truth. <br />I wonder whether the author, who travelled much and committed suicide at age 89, entered autobiographical notes into his narrative.	2001-10-18

Home turf is St. Jude in the Midwest. Gary and Denise now live in Philadelphia, Chip roams between New York and Lithuania.<BR>Enid terrorizes everybody with motherly love. She is stuck way back in her own generation. Alfred has Parkinson's and is slipping fast into dementia. But he is a strong, upright character and the only one who always makes sense when he speaks. Gary is a banker who runs after money and tries to figure out his family. Chip is the one with the brains, but he refuses to use them in any constructive way.

And one has to love flighty Chip. Gary isn't really around that much.

It is interesting to see that there, too, the young generation becomes more liberal.

At the center of the story is Paulina, who progresses from a 16-year old farm girl from Western Kenya to a self-assured and matured woman in Nairobi. Maybe for the first time, an author who lives in Nairobi, tells us about the common people and the disenfranchised masses in that city -  something a tourist would never see or even think of. It is a fascinating story, and so very well written. Interwoven with this tale are the political happenings, from MauMau to Uhuru and to the final statehood under Kenyatta. She describes the feuds between the different tribes, such as the Luo from Lake Victoria, the Swahili from the East Coast, and the dominant but persecuted Kikuyu from the Rift valley. Murder and mayhem did not bode well for the new country and the inside readings from this book are fascinating.<br />On a personal note: early in 1969 I had the very special experience to meet Tom Mboya, who was then 39 years old and a rising star in Kenya's politics. At that time, my stated view was that he would either be president, or be killed. Tom Mboya was assassinated in July of that year. I am very glad to see from this book that this brilliant young man has not been forgotten.	2001-09-09

They are still poor, and they still fight the British. They will not be subdued.<br />And then there is the Kelly Gang. By now, they are legend in Australia. Good or bad? Some compare them to Robin Hood. Others see in them a symbol of Irish fight against British suppression. In reality they were four horse thieves, bank robbers and murderers. All in all, they were a gang of criminals.<br />The author tries to tell us - in sympathy with the Kellys: &quot;The devil made them do it&quot;.

Mariagrazia Ardengo, the mother, will not give up her pretensions though financially ruined and without hope for the future. She has two children, both in their twenties. Carla, who is bored with her present life, wants to change it drastically and overnight. Michele, who shows the indifference of the book's title, cannot get aroused by anything or anybody. Lisa, the mother's friend, has sunk to the level of a fat, penniless tramp, searches desperately for somebody to love her - or to at least pretend it. And then there is Leo. Leo used to be the lover of Lisa, until Mariagrazia took him away from her. Leo is the source of their financial ruin. Leo has money. Leo wants something fresher, younger, unspoiled. Leo goes after Carla. And he succeeds. After Mariagrazia and Lisa spend their time fighting over Leo, they are now left out in the cold. Michele cannot be touched by any of this but hopes that, one of these days, he can get a real life. <br />Moravia started on this book when he was eighteen and it was published in 1929 when he was twenty-one. He did not have the life experience he so stunningly shows in his later work. I get the impression that he studied too much of the French literature of those times and tried to follow it. That makes this novel less than perfect and somewhat outdated.	2001-05-06

They determined the course and form of our country after the revolution. The author uses six episodes, each of them focusing on one individual, to tell us about the tribulations after 1786. As he so rightly says: Various interests band together to start and fight a revolution. More often than not, no clear goals are set for the time after a successful revolution. Interest groups fall apart again and each one tries to put their program on top of the heap. And that is how revolutions fail - in their aftermath.<br />Mr. Ellis shows us the two main groups: The Federalists, who want a strong central government, and the Republicans, who want decentralized state rights. The first president after Washington (a tough act to follow), was the Federalist John Adams. His vice president was Jefferson, leader of the Republicans, who did his utmost to sink the presidency of Mr. Adams. In the final result, the Republicans from the South won. Otherwise we would now have a government like Great Britain.<br />Of course, deals were made on a weekly basis. But the protagonists knew each other well and managed to overcome personal antagonism for the good of the future country. It is touching to read about the friendship between Jefferson and Adams that fell apart during the latter's presidency, only to be revived many years later when they tried, in many letters, to explain themselves to each other.<br />But the main lesson here is that, without the foresight and engagement of these Founding Brothers, our republic may have turned out dismal or perhaps not at all. We must be eternally grateful to them.<br />And we must be grateful to Mr. Ellis for his superb book.	2001-05-04

Ollie is a troubled lad, who has hallucinations during the day and cannot sleep because of his nightmares. We first meet him as a lowly clerk in a supermarket and are made part of the terrifying past that haunts him. But the details are never spelled out and one can only guess at the outlines. Then Ollie goes to London and the whole story congeals and unfolds. Ollie blames himself for some of the terrible things that happened that time in London while he is unable to understand the others. He is caught in a swamp of vicious crime and it slowly drowns him. The story escalates until it ends in a nasty persiflage of justice.<br />First of all, the author shows courage in starting a book with events that make little sense, trusting that the reader will not give up on him. Secondly, he shows incredible imagination in placing us into the tortured soul of this young man and succeeding in making us feel it. And, in addition, the language is superb.<br />This is a must-read!	2001-04-30

One day he finds an unknown book by a little known Austrian writer. This is his chance now to create something original with his translation. Like any good translator, he gets involved with the thought process of the original author. But Fabrizio also gets involved with the life of the Austrian, who died in 1913. Frustration becomes resignation as he becomes the Austrian and thus slowly destroys himself.<br />Elegant and worthwhile reading.	2001-04-03

Much philosophy about life as an Indian, and many descriptions about their life in those times.<br />But: How true is all of this? The author himself writes &quot;The 'Old American&quot; is fiction, but I've stayed close to the facts of the Natan Blake captivity as I've been able to divine it from the history books. I used very few original sources&quot;. In other words: the facts are few, most of it is fiction. At that point it becomes a well written novel, reflecting the author's predilections.	2001-03-29

It is his hobby to copy the cards of famous people and to keep a file on them. One day, by mistake, he pulls out a card of an unknown woman. And here the obsession begins: To find this woman. Jose, who is 50 years old and lives alone in a dilapidated little house, gets deeper and deeper into the mystery of this woman who remains nameless. He has pictures of her as a school child, but does not know what she looks now at age 36 - or even if she is still alive. He can not let go of his research and he slowly, but surely, falls in love with this unknown.In the end, he is left alone again, now 51 years old, sick, and asking himself what he should do now with the rest of his life. But he learned many things about his inner self and his ability to cope with life outside of his job.<br />The author does a magnificent job of peeling his hero like an onion until his inner self is reached. And that is most worthwhile learning about. A wonderful book.	2001-03-18

Their thorough research must be recommended. The book should interest anybody interested in global business as it is promoted these days.<br />Now that the story of the merger is known, it should be interesting to see the later developments. Share prices are dropping. Chrysler is hemorrhaging money with gigantic quarterly losses. Not a single American remains in a top managerial position. Could this be foreseen?<br />It all started with an outright lie about &quot;merger amongst equals&quot;. As Schrempp later openly admitted, he never sought such a merger but wanted a takeover from the beginning. On this basis, Kerkorian is now suing and, hopefully, be successful. The clash of cultures between American and German - both private and in business - can not be bridged. The authors should have put more emphasis on this.<br />But, mainly, the authors should have investigated the personality or Jürgen Schrempp more carefully instead of being blinded by this blue-eyed, basso-voiced genius. What do you say about a person who openly declares that he is throwing out his wife of 31 years because work is more important to him? Schrempp drove Fokker into bankruptcy. Schrempp messed up the takeover of Dornier. Schrempp bought a major stake in Mitsubishi, although it keeps losing money and seems close to bankruptcy without redeeming plans. Schrempp is responsible for Adtrans, and they are losing money. Schrempp ran AEG into the ground.<br />Right on, Mr. Schrempp. You are a genius, as anybody can see. Next on the disaster list is Chrysler.	2001-03-15

The pranks they play are different from what we expect nowadays. They are directed against the totalitarian regime, the all-encompassing graft, the lack of freedom. Some of these boys were soldiers towards the end of the war, first killing Russians, then killing Germans. There are no surprises left for them except freedom. Rather be a street sweeper in London than a big shot in Hungary.  Is this book funny? Yes - with the blackest humor you are likely to see in a long time. Is it a satire? No - Every last sentence is the absolute truth, exactly as it happened so many years ago. I strongly suspect that this is the author's autobiography. He was there and has lived through it all. <br />In many ways, it is a very disturbing book. It shows that just a few people with machine guns can - and will - rule a whole country. It is a lesson to be remembered. Even when freedom finally comes, it only lasts a few days. Soviet tanks roll right over it.<br />Read it, think about it, remember it.	2001-02-12

Even caesium and laser clocks do not satisfy him, because they do not compensate for the differences in the time of the earth's revolutions. His final instrument coordinates with the Greenwich meridian - that also touches his wife's grave.

In the end she loses Joni and rids herself of Arye. A finish that does not make very much sense.<br />The author presents us with a modern philosophy and that may not be to everyone's taste. But the pictures she forms are worth reading. In one passage she compares an old, dying woman with somebody who shrank in the laundry. Interesting are also her comparison to the old testament, quoting Absalom and the story of the carpenter who loses his wife.<br />Interesting and worth reading.	2001-02-09

The result is an overwhelming book, with the spaces in between the facts filled with hot air. Evidently, the author tried to loosen up the rather dry proceedings.<br />Nevertheless, it is a book of quality. It shows what the big guys at the global imperiums can and will do to you. &quot;The customer is our enemy&quot;, so they said. I especially enjoyed the fact that these guys fell for the Nigerian Hoax - something even Joe at the gas station would not fall for. But then, greed conquers all.	2001-02-07

So little is known about Crazy Horse that it can easily contained in this small volume. We are given a concise portrait of the man, his life and his aspirations.

Then he repeats the mistake he made in previous books: He doesn't want to throw anything away, so he crams it into the book. But with too much material, and no selection, things get disorganized and repetitive. It is an interesting book, but not a good one. The maps are a disaster, as in his previous books. They are not detailed enough, and many important places are not shown. I am now waiting for the sequel, using up material he did not bring in this book - as this seems to be Mr. Ambrose's want.	2000-11-27

But the sideshow is a real whopper. The story is told by Murray Whelan, gofer and fixer for Charlene Wills. Charlene and her colostomy bag are Minister for Industry of the reigning Labor Party. Her advisor, Angelo Agnelli, is Murray's boss who sends him to the Pacific Pastoral meat works to check out possible political implications in the freezing death of foreman Ekrem Bayraktar. Things spiral downwards from there with the entry of an industrial super mogul, the questionable shop steward Herb Gardiner, not to mention Ayisha Celik, that Turkish honey pot. <br />The author not only has a way with words. He also has an incredible sense of humor. He takes the Australian political scene apart in a roaring satire without letup or ending. His description of the Italian and Turkish minorities is memorable. <br />This book makes you laugh all the way to the end.	2000-11-19

He has no ideas about arts, but then politics is politics, and how difficult can it be? He finds out without delay, when young artist Marcus Taylor is found floating in the moat in front of the National Gallery. Time for damage control. But then things become increasingly weird. The overpriced picture of a shadowy, and also dead, artist named Victor Szabo. Hold it! Is the picture a fake? Who painted the duplicate? How about all those suave self-made millionaires and their sudden interest in art? Mayhem erupts as everybody tries to cover up their nefarious schemes. And Murray in the thick of it, of course. <br />The book is presented as a mystery. But that part does not come off too well with all the fun intervening. Rather, it is a send-up comedy about Australian politics and the doers behind the scenes. If you really want to laugh for a few hours, then read this book.	2000-11-05

They are right, of course, because it is a most wonderful story. I would not place it in the darkest of Dark Ages - it was written when life was rather civilized already. The Merovingian kings are mentioned, and that puts a time stamp on it. But whoever wrote it made up a magnificent story of murder and mayhem, of chivalry and cowardice, of ruling and serving. It seems to contain faint traces of other epics: Siegemund the dragon slayer, and the dragon guarding the gold treasure in the mountain. Maybe they were standard props at the time.<br />Mr. Heaney's translation is a thing of pure joy. He writes in earthy, to the point language. That makes the book such a great pleasure.	2000-10-28

At the Battle of Solferino, the young lieutenant Trotta saves the life of Emperor Franz Joseph I. Henceforth he is a colonel and named the Baron von Trotta. The story continues to his son Franz, who becomes a government official as county governor in Bohemia/Galicia - and to his grandson Carl Joseph, who enters military service. It ends with Carl Joseph as a lieutenant in a second-rate chasseur regiment.<br />During the intervening years, we watch the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy slowly disintegrate, just as the Trotta family goes from the Hero of Solferino to an officer of little account. Carl Joseph wished back to his grandfather, and the Emperor thinks back to when he was young. There are many characters in this book, drawn in magnificent three-dimensional detail, and all of them just as flawed as the Trotta family. The monarchy is eaten up from the inside by these government servants who have no goal and no drive, either spend their days gambling and drinking, or rapidly moving closer to some form of suicide.<br />The author gives us magnificent descriptions of the times, the people, and their surroundings. It is a book that will haunt you for some time to come, not least because it is very sad and depressing.	2000-10-24

Mr. Bent publishes the story and the follow-ups in his local gazette. The rev. Kidney tries to make himself invisible to avoid having to baptize Arthur. Mother Sarah Dyer quickly grabs the opportunity and charges admission for the Viewing of Arthur. We also meet Mr. Scully, the batty pseudo scientist, a band of brigands, Mrs. Fitzgerald the school mistress, and many, many more of these whacky characters, interspersed with the beautifully described lowlife of the penal colony. <br />Do get this book!	2000-10-24

This is not an exhaustive history text and should not be faulted for giving an overview only instead of minutia. The treatment is astonishingly evenhanded, with little rancor to either side.<br />On the other hand, the author often injects opinions without giving enough background or follow-up material. As an example: When Hitler and Stalin split Poland at the end of 1939, all inhabitants of the Western (German) half were transported to the Eastern (Russian) half. The now empty Western half was resettled, within weeks, with German farmers from Germany's Eastern provinces. Another example: When the Germans rounded up the Jews in Hungary, they offered them to the western Allies in exchange for hard currency. The Allies declined, and the Jews went to the gas chambers.<br />What can we learn from this book? In conduct and atrocity, Germany and Russia were mirror images. Germany fought this war against Russia, just as the US fought its war against Japan. Everything else is just so many footnotes to World War II. We also learn that Russia won this war - almost single-handedly - because their soldiers sloshed through mud and snow, against cold and hunger, long before anybody else appeared.	2000-10-13

Be it as it may, it is a most interesting novel about the West of the US in the late 19th century. It reminds us that things were still wild and woolly while in Europe they had more elegant killings. All the gang is here, so often heard of from old gazettes. It also amazes how young they all were. They were riding off robbing and killing at an age where nowadays the parents would still call up the baby-sitter. <br />The only quarrel I have with the book is, that it has long stretches of tediousness. All the descriptions of far horizons and beige horse manure stretch too far. Also, the author must have used every adjective known to Funk and Wagnalls at least twice. That gets irritating.	2000-10-12

Churchill and Roosevelt conniving to get the US actively into a war the people did not really want.

Husband and step father is a shadow in the background,  because men do not really count. Scarlet's neighbor and very best friend is  Constance, who has a Turkish boyfriend and who sells things that fall off  trucks with the aid of her Gypsy family. Constance is the amateur  psychiatrist, who explains the facts of life to Scarlet - either with  straight forward, no nonsense talk, or else with the help of strong  spirits.<br />This is a wonderful book, taking a surgical knife to England's  middle class.

He has been happily married to Sherrie, the  college nurse, and his daughter Ruby, a sophomore at the state college,  hasn't talked to him in over a year. Swenson is content and tenured.<br />His  class consists of two boys and seven girls. But only Angela Argo sticks out  with her black leather jacket, changing hair color and a face pierced with  more hardware than any jeweler could dream of. In the meantime, the faculty  discusses harassment and little else. Get it? &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; in  modern garb.<br />So, within a few pages of the book you know what is going to  happen: Professor falls for strange chick, and chick ruins professor. Where  they lost me: Why should Swenson go for this loser (even if she can write  stories) when there is so much better material around? Why now, after more  than twenty years of marriage? Mid-life crisis? No. Why then pick Angela  Argo, who is disliked by just about everybody else? And why does Angela,  all of a sudden, turn absolutely vicious with as devastating harassment  suit? <br />Nobody knows. Not even the author.

He changes his name to  Akenaten, denies the god Amun, has the name of all other gods extinguished  and distributes their temples and the wealth of the priests to the poor. He  leaves Thebes and creates Akenaten, his own city of light. He will never  tell a lie, will never punish an evildoer and believes only in the  surmounting power of love.<br />How do you deal with such a heretic? Love  turns to envy, envy turns to hate. The enemy crosses the country's borders.  The people revolt. The priests plot against him. All friends desert.  Nefertiti leaves him. He dies young. His city of light disintegrates.  <br />The book consists of &quot;interviews&quot; - about 15 years after the  Pharaoh's death - with his closest friends and counsellors: his teacher,  the high priest of his new religion, the chief of police, the leader of the  army, and many more - ending with Nefertiti herself. By now they can tell  the truth about their relationship to the king. Obviously, the message of  all encompassing love for all the creatures on earth did not penetrate very  far. Some want to promote their own gain, others just simply hate. Most  think that he was somewhat demented. <br />The author looks at the story of  love from many sides and comes up disappointed. The Pharaoh has a striking  resemblances to a more modern Messiah who also had to fail in his lifetime.  The parallels to he New Testament are striking and wonderfully written.  Mahfouz is a religious thinker and writer of the very first rank. He makes  you think.<br />It would help greatly in the understanding of this book to  study the historical background of the heretic Pharaoh. I recommend  &quot;The Murder of Tutanhamen&quot; by Bob Brier.	2000-08-27

The story of a young woman, Eva Stern, fro Germany in the early 1930s, to the  ghetto, the concentration camp, and final liberation. Without the usual  accusing finger, yet bringing forth the shocking truths of utter human  degradation. But the nature of Blood also deals with black Othello and  white Desdemona, and a Jewish Ethiopian transplanted into Israel, the land  yearned for and ending up disappointing. But the finale tells us that  liberation does not set us free. We can not wipe out the past and  understand the future: it is a foreign land to us and we do not fit.<br />A  wonderful, but deeply disturbing book. It should be widely read.	2000-08-21

He now starts on life-long probation. Only half way through the book do we learn about his crime: a murderous rampage. The author traces his  reentry into normal life, with the help of saint-like probation officers  Kiyoura and Take Bayashi. He gets a job at the Akiyama Poultry Farm, where  the owner bends over backwards to reintroduce him to a normal life.  Everybody is so extremely helpful that you wonder what kind of system this  is - unless it was invented to further the basic concept of the  novel.<br />Kikutani can not adjust to life outside of his prison cell, a life  where he has to make his own decisions and is responsible himself for his  everyday living. This is, no way, a new cognition. It has been known for  many years that long term prisoners do not want to leave the security of  the prison. Nevertheless, the author makes a good and well written story  out of it.	2000-05-31

This being fiction, things get quite involved, of course, with  murder, mayhem  and a family confusion right out of Gilbert and Sullivan.

The main character is Rose, with her mother Corazon and her children Raphael and Lita. They are a tightly knit family, living in Manila. Rosa, who came from a poor barrio, escaped  to be a physician - but can't forget Lito, the love of her teen age. Don  Pepe highjacks ships for a living and makes some extra pesos with  protection money. Alfredo is the lonely savant. Vincente and Totoy are  street children. All their lives are written up nicely, against the  background of Manila and the barrio. The mood is set by innumerable  sunsets.<br />Now all these fates are converged and twisted together. There is  no reason for it, just sheer happenstance. The writing is good and clear,  but twisting all the fates into a final strand really makes little sense. A  nice read, but not overwhelming.	2000-05-27

It lasted two days. 40'000 soldiers were killed. Napoleon, accompanied by his trusted marshals Berthier, Lannes and Massena, was on his way to  Vienna. The Austro-Hungarian forces met him at the Danube, at the plain of  Essling. Napoleon miscalculated the terrain and hesitated. He lost the  battle.  The author describes the 48 hours, meticulously researched, in  incredibly vivid detail. The sound of the battle. The cannon shot ripping  through the ranks of Napoleon's imperial guard. The field hospital awash in  blood,  amputated limbs and the dead. The surgeons' muscles giving out from  sawing arm after arm, leg after leg. Soldiers fleeing across the Danube to  a little island in the river, not being safe there either. An incredible  carnage, interspersed with observations of the life in Vienna. The writer  Stendhal and the painter Lejeune caught up in it.  The author paints a  picture that is incredibly vivid. It is on the same level as Plivier's  &quot;Stalingrad&quot; in describing th command of the battle and the  mortal fear of the common soldiers. In 1998, this book won the highest  French literary award, the Prix Goncourt. It amply deserved it. It must be  read by everyone interested in military history. Two weeks after the battle  of Essling, the composer Haydn died in Vienna.	2000-05-26

The story is tightly written and moves along at a fabulous pace. The sentences are simple and the grammar is good. This is  excellent writing, indeed. The plot was well researched, e.g. the author  gives a perfect description of the town of Geneva. There is nothing sloppy  here. The story itself is fabulous and it is developed extremely well. The  international conspiracy does make sense and is interesting: Such cases of  hiding German assets after 1945  do exist, and so do the characters who  disappear into the woodwork with the loot. Small correction: Hitler would  not have appointed anybody that young, and such a recent member of the  Party, to such a high position. And why is just about everybody over 6 feet  tall? I recommend this book not just as a good mystery, but as a true work  of literature.	2000-05-19

Has it some deeply hidden, dark meaning of a philosophical nature? Who knows? It can be rather confusing. The author handles the English language beautifully and can raise her prose to near poetry. The actors on the stage and their surroundings are sharply drawn. For that alone, the book is a pleasure to read. However, towards the end, the narration seems to flatten out and just bring confusion without greater purpose...	2000-05-16

While the Great Game , from 1820 to 1947, was mainly played between the British and the Russians, the Chinese were a  determining factor. How to get into Northern India? From the North, you  have to go through Tibet - a country that was effectively closed off and  is, now more than ever, under the rule of China. Coming from the West, you  must go through Afghanistan. Everybody tried that, and nobody succeeded.  These attempts are the basis of the Great Game, as it was played by the  powers on the back of individual explorers, surveyors, zoologists and  religious fanatics. Few of them succeeded, most of them perished.<br />The  authors spend more time on cute details than on overall strategy. They like  the anecdotal incidence. And they get sidetracked into long discussions  about subjects that have nothing really to do with the problem at hand. For  instance, religion.<br />Disturbing is the bias shown. Sven Hedin, on all  accounts, was a great explorer. That his politics were questionable should  not diminish his accomplishments. The same goes for Dr. Schaefer. Ground  into the dirt because of the German sponsorship of his expedition. But when  he goes off with an American he, all of a sudden, becomes that likable  young fellow.<br />Also, I wholeheartedly agree with a previous reviewer: The  maps presented in the book are garbage and should not have been allowed.	2000-05-08

And her mafia-connection background was never checked out? Come  on! Get real! And then she drives off all over the place in her own car,  without an escort?

A red-flag-waving socialist from way back, as well as a pacifist, he tells us how he sees this century. Unless you know German history in quite some  detail, the book will be of no use to you. Interesting are the comments on  Remarque and Juenger. Remarque's &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;  must be one of the most scathing indictments of World War I. Juenger, on  the other hand, was always a gung-ho militarist who never had enough  enemies to attack for the glory of the fatherland. It should also be said  that Grass is not revered in his home country, but generally loathed. He  did not even get good reviews when he received the Nobel Prize for the sum  of his work.

A very sad book, and very disturbing.	1999-10-21
