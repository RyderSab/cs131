US	51959847	R14F8QZDRWKY75	4770028962	326209559	Coin Locker Babies	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A nihilistic fairytale	This is the second Murakami Ryu book that I have read.  My interest in him was peaked by talk of the \\"Other Murakami,\\" the dark reflection of award-winning popular novelist Murakami Haruki.  My first Ryu book, \\"Almost Transparent Blue,\\"  was a captivating tale of bottom-feeders and gutter-life in tune with Irvine Welsh's \\"Trainspotting\\" and William S. Burroughs's \\"Junky.\\"  This dirty little tale grabbed my interest and got me hunting for the next adventure.  And then \\"Coin Locker Baby\\" blew me away.<br /><br />Unlike the semi-autobiographical nature of \\"Almost Transparent Blue,\\"  \\"Coin Locker Babies\\" is a full-fledged novel, an unsettling fantasy firmly rooted in a grim reality.  Taking its title and beginning on an actual cultural phenomenon in Japan, that of unhappy mothers abandoning their new-born children in train station coin lockers,  Ryu then manifests a strange Japan, an amalgamation of anime-world and modern troubles.  It is a place where Tokyo harbors a corrupted and polluted abandoned city, called Toxitown, right in the middle of its most exclusive business district.  A place where a fashion model keeps a full-grown crocodile in her swampy apartment, and a hero's greatest ambition is to kill everyone and bring peace.<br /><br />Into this bizarro Japan Ryu introduces two boys, the only survivors of the coin-locker baby fad.  A bi-sexual popstar (Hashi) who is slowly being consumed by his fame, and a jockish pole-vaulter (Kiku) who seeks to unleash poison death and silence the world.  Each has an equally fitting lover: Anemone, a ethereal beauty who hunts for a Crocodile Heaven, and Neva, whose breasts having been lost to cancer makes her the perfect companion for the bi-sexual star.  These four wind their intertwining lives together, never quite admirable but somehow remaining sympathetic.  One does not know whether to root for their success or destruction.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Ryu's writing that he keeps the reader always on his/her toes, flitting between reality and fantasy, rarely giving something solid to hold on to.  Originally published in 1980, \\"Coin Locker Babies\\" is eerily prophetic of the 1995 Sarin Gas attacks on Tokyo from the Aum Shinrikyo Apocalypse cult.  Kiku's desire to unleash the toxin Datura rings a little bit too true after the fact.  The translation is flawless, with important cultural notes seamlessly blended, giving the Western reader much-needed clues on otherwise unfamiliar cultural practices.<br /><br />While not able to fully yield to his depressing reality, I am finding myself more attracted to the dark vision of the \\"Other Murakami.\\"  I am eager to see what else this amazing talent has to offer, and will definitely be checking out more novels as they are translated., flitting between reality and fantasy, rarely giving something solid to hold on to.

US	51959847	R2G6BB2PALQYCG	4889961151	645908422	Japanese in Mangaland: Learning The Basics	Books	5	36	38	N	N	A fun, structured course and a great study aid	Learning Japanese through the medium of manga is a no-brainer.  Many Japanese learners first interest in the language originally stems from an interest in anime and manga, and want the ability to go beyond English-translated merchandise and be able to pick and choose from the massive ocean of material that is untranslated in Japan.<br /><br />\\"Japanese in Mangaland: Basic Japanese Course using Manga\\" accepts this, and builds a solid learning system based on usage and mis-usage in Japanese comics.  Originally written in Spanish for Spanish learners of Japanese, it was so successful that the book was re-formatted for English learners, and it works just as well.<br /><br />The book follows the format of introducing a grammar point, then following it up with manga examples taken from real Japanese comics.  A serious study aid, it begins with learning the kana, both hiragana and katakana as well as basic kanji, then begins vocabulary building with repetition and increasing difficulty.  Each section then concludes with a quiz to test yourself on what you learned.  There are also cultural lessons in each chapter that give the necessary background to understand some of the subtleties of Japanese.<br /><br />This approach has been tried before in \\"Mangajin's Basic Japanese Through Comics,\\" but that book lacked a structured approach to language learning and instead focused on \\"cool phrases\\" and was unsuitable for beginners.  \\"Japanese in Mangaland\\" is much more of an actual study course.<br /><br />The only drawbacks to \\"Japanese in Mangaland\\" is that the manga used are not particularly famous, and will probably be unfamiliar to Western audiences. It may not even be their idea of \\"manga,' as generally only one style is imported to the US.  Also, although the emphasis is on kana, romaji is used throughout and it may have been more challenging to slowly eliminate it as the course progressed.<br /><br />As with all language learning, this should not be your only course, as speaking and listening practice is irreplaceable.  But, as a fun supplement, it is an excellent book that still managed to teach me a thing or two even after several years of Japanese study.course, as speaking and listening practice is irreplaceable.

Tales of pirates, desert sorceresses, lusty women and dangerous men	The mysterious desert.  The high plains.  The stormy seas.  The dense jungles.  These are the places where actions speak louder than words, where the sharp retort of a six-gun decides who is right and who is dead, and a blind tiger stalks with preternatural senses and determination.  These are the settings for Adventure Tales, a genre of literature prominent in the 1900's, in which many of the finest authors of the period plied their trades.<br /><br />In this, their 12th volume, Graphic Classics has assembled an anthology of some of the greatest adventure stories of the time, full of hot blood and cold nights, mystery and magic.  These classic tales have been interpreted by a host of talented illustrators, lending their own unique insight into the authors original stories.  This is their second anthology book, like Volume 10 \\"Horror Classics,\\" combining many workers in the genre rather than focusing on a specific author.<br /><br />Some of the best authors are on display here.  Robert Louis Stevenson, author of \\"Treasure Island,\\" Sax Rohmer, creator of Yellow Peril villain Fu Manchu, Alexander Dumas, creator of The Three Musketeers, renowned cowboy author Zane Grey, Damon Runyon, author of \\"The Idylls of Miss Sarah\\" which was adapted as the musical \\"Guys and Dolls,\\"  Rafael Sabatinin master of Pirate Tales and creator of Captain Blood, Johnston McCully creator of the swashbuckling Zorro, Sherlock Holme's creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Rudyard Kipling, author of \\"The Jungle Books.\\"<br /><br />Finally, there is O. Henry, whom if it weren't for Graphics Classics, I might have known nothing more of than the sweet Christmas fable, \\"The Gift of the Magi,\\" rather than met him as a scribbler of dark cowboy adventures.<br /><br />This volume contains:<br /><br />The Wind Blew Shrill and Sharp - A lusty sea poem by Robert Louis Stevenson. Skot Olsen provides an excellent and strong sailor to accompany the compelling verse.<br /><br />In the Valley of the Sorceress - Egypt was a mysterious and magical place at the time, and  Sax Rohmer weaves a web of desire and danger.  An archaeologist attempts to open the hidden tomb of Sorceress Queen Hatasu, but finds his efforts daunted, and his soul beguiled by a beautiful Arab maiden.  Illustrator JB Bonivert brings a unique and fanciful style to this classic adventure.<br /><br />The Masked Ball - By Alexander Dumas.  A short and dark tale of heartbreak and desire, accompanied by a hedonistic masked ball where people seek to drown their loneliness and hide their faces.  Michael Manning provides a dark atmosphere, heavy with black spaces, as an appropriate accompaniment.<br /><br />Tigre - The jungles of Mexico are the setting for this tale of lust and revenge.  By Zane Grey, an old farmer is a master of wild animals, particularly his blind brutish tiger named Tigre.  The only thing he can't tame is his young and pretty wife.  Who stalks who in the dense jungle?  A straight-forward but perfect comic book adaptation by Don Marquez, particularly of the lovely Senora.<br /><br />The Shooting of Dan McGrew - A popular cowboy poem by Robert W. Service, adapted with humor and pathos by Hunt Emerson. A lonely miner, a dangerous gambler, and the lady that's known as Lou.<br /><br />Two Men Named Collins - Damon Runyon gives us a sad and silently heroic of two soldiers who share the same name.  On is lonely and ugly, one is popular and handsome.  But the one holds the secret of the other, and nobility is not always what it seems.  Illustrator Noel Tuazon does a spectacular adaptation of this tail, lending even more weight and atmospher to the yarn.<br /><br />Blood Money -  An adventure of Rafael Sabatinin's celebrated rouge Captain Blood.  A straight-forward comic book adaptation by Kevin Atkinson, this is a clever celebration of the key to Captain Bloods success.  Pure luck.<br /><br />Gunga Din -Rudyard Kipling gives us a blood-rousing poem of an Indian water bearer and the Thuggee wars.  The prose is amazing. \\"But when it comes to slaughter, you will do your work on water, an' you'll lick the bloomin' boots of 'im that's got it.\\"  Great illustrations by Mary Fleener, this was the first time I had read this classic poem.<br /><br />The Man without a Shadow - An Irish short story author, this is a companion piece to \\"A Day-Dream\\" which appears in \\"Horror Classics.\\"  A whimsical adaptation by Milton Knight of a clever tale.<br /><br />The Mystery of the Semi-Detached - I always knew Edith Nesbit as the author of the children's tales \\"The Boxcar Children,\\" but little did I know she had this tale of murder and ghosts in her.  With excellent Victorianesque illustrations by Antonella Caputo.<br /><br />The Stolen Story - Johnston McCully is best known for swashbuckling, but this tale of fictional theft is equally gripping.  A man's dreams are met, although they turn into a nightmare.  With appropriately grotesque illustrations by Chris Pelletiere.<br /><br />The Crime of the Brigadier - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had many characters, one of them Brigadier Gerard, a teller of tall-tales and adventurer in Napoleon's army.  This funny yarn is comically adapted by Nick Miller is a suiting style.<br /><br />The Roads We Take -  Another black tale of cowboys by O. Henry, a story of betrayal, and a man's true character.

US	51959847	R6Y1URBY46AX7	0375719318	832921713	The Secret History of the Lord of Musashi and Arrowroot: Two Novels	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A perverse Samurai Lord and a nostalgic trip to a mountain village	Junichiro Tanizaki is often a complicated, perverse author.  He delves into the mysterious realm of sexual fetishism and body horror, presenting grotesqueries in a uniquely straight-forward writing style that is itself neither fetishistic nor perverse, lending an air of normalcy to the bizarre figures that populate his tales.  At the same time, he can write sensitive, beautiful stories without a hint of sexual exploration.<br /><br />Taking a similar theme in two very different directions, \\"The Secret History of the Lord of Musashi/Arrowroot\\" showcases these two sides of Tanizaki's talent.  Both deal with \\"books within a book,\\" using this device as a launching point for the narrative.  One is a dark tale of body horror and sexual perversion, and the other is a simple piece of nostalgia.  The two stories were said to be the author's favorites.<br /><br />\\"The Secret History of the Lord of Musashi\\" revolves around a fictional Samurai lord, and two fictional \\"re-discovered texts\\" that detail the secret sexual life of the Lord of Musashi.  From the two books, The Dream of a Night and Memiors of Doamai,  the narrator pieces together the cruel pleasures of a man obsessed with nose-less severed heads.  In his young boyhood, he watched the women washing the severed heads of defeated Samurai and experienced his first sexual desire while watching their beautiful fingers manipulating the grotesque objects.  Unquenched bye the passing years, his fetish leads him to an affair with the passionately cruel Lady Kikyo, who's father's nose he severed as a boy.  Finally, his own marriage is encountered, and the abuse of his servant Doamai.<br /><br />The writing style, using an almost lectural tone of one giving a class on the life of the Lord of Musashi,  softens the impact of the horror of using severed heads as sexual aids.  It is a very interesting story, in the true Tanizaki style.<br /><br />\\"Arrowroot\\" is much shorter, and is set in the hidden mountains of Yoshino, in Nara prefecture.  Two friends take a trip to the mountains, under the premise of going to see a fabled drum in the possession of a small village family.  The author thinks of the trip as research into a possible historical novel detailing the Southern Court, while his friend has a secret motive.  The story is very beautifully written, sensitive and nostalgic.  It is a complete reversal from \\"The Secret History of the Lord of Musashi\\" and yet is somehow a perfect companion.n Nara prefecture.

Mark Twain is undoubtedly America's \\"Great Man of Letters.\\" A complicated author, he flowed easily through humor, satire, psychological horror, politics, religion, and pretty much any other subject imaginable. He was able to hold up a dark mirror to society, and stare unflinchingly at the organizations, traditions, and political and moral decay that always threaten to drown a civilization. And he spun a great yarn.<br /><br />He is a great candidate for the Graphics Classics series, offering a wealth of short stories and witticisms to inspire illustrators to create, adapt and partner with the great author to produce some original works. Even his shortest story packs a solid wallop, and the one page gems are as good as the more lengthy pieces.<br /><br />This updated edition brings back some of the great yarns from the first edition, with several of the smaller pieces cleared away to make way for a grand adventure staring the irrepressible Tom Sawyer and friends.<br /><br />Included in this collection are:<br /><br />Tom Sawyer Abroad - By far Twain's most famous and enduring character, most of us only know him from \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huck Finn\\", but he actually made quite a few appearances.  This is a Jules Verne inspired tale of Tom, Huck and Jim commandeering a flying machine and heading off for Africa.  Illustrated by George Sellas, this adaptation captures the raucous spirit and deeper wisdom inherent in the character.<br /><br />The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County - Possibly the most famous tale in the collection, it is given a straight-forward comic book style adaptation. I vaguely remembered reading this story in Elementary school, and it was a nice way to be re-introduced to it.<br /><br />A Dog's Tale - Without a doubt the stand-out piece in the book, and possibly the best achievement in the entire Graphic Classics series. A stunning adaptation by Lance Tooks adds an additional element to this sad story of a devoted dog and the family with which it lives. The true power of words and pictures is put on display in this adaptation.<br /><br />Advice to Little Girls - An anthology of witticisms each with a different illustrator, revealing the dual-nature of little girls. Sugar and Spice, Naughty and Nice.<br /><br />The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut - Twain battles to defeat his own conscience, an intolerable bother since the day he was born. His conscience thinks it is up for the battle...<br /><br />A Curious Pleasure Excursion - Another powerful adaptation, William L. Brown provides woodblock illustrations to illustrate Twain's advertisement for a luxury trip aboard the Comet Coggia!<br /><br />Is He Living or is He Dead? - Simon Gane lends his old-fashioned style to a tale of artistic fame and true talent, as four painters conspire to gain wealth from poverty. The only condition is that one of their number must die in order to become famous.<br /><br />The Mysterious Stranger - Adapted by Richard Geary, a regular of the Graphics Classics series, this story features three young boys who meet a mysterious stranger. The happy visitor announces himself as Satan, and proceeds to show the three boys the true nature of a happy life.

Very little has been written on what is an elusive and complicated world.<br /><br />Filling this gap, \\"Japanese Horror Cinema\\" is an academic study of the various worlds of Japanese horror cinema, an assemblage of essays by various authors each elucidating one of four essential topics.  The essays are mainly sociologically based, involving more of the psychology of Japanese fear rather than cinematography or film-studies based.  Each focus area is accompanied by a case study of an individual horror film or series.<br /><br />\\"History, Tradition and Japanese Horror Cinema\\" looks at films from a historical basis, looking at the evolution and foundation of Japanese Horror Cinema.  The aesthetics of cruelty is shown from traditional Japanese theatre such as Kabuki and Noh, and how they relate to modern-day horror.  The case study for this section is Nakata Hideo's \\"Ringu\\" and \\"Ringu 2.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gender, Terror and the \\"Avenging Spirit\\" Motif in Japanese Horror Cinema\\" looks at Japanese Horror under Western eyes as well as Anime Horror and the Japanese interpretation of the rape/revenge genre.  The case study for this section is Ishii Takashi's \\"Freeze Me.\\"<br /><br />\\"National Anxieties and Cultural Fears in Japanese Horror Cinema\\" looks at Japanese body-horror and technophobia as seen in films such as \\"Tetsuo the Iron Man\\"<br /><br />  and \\"Pinnochio 964.\\"  The case study for this section is Fukasaku Kinji's \\"Battle Royale.\\"<br /><br />\\"Japanese Horror Cinema and the the Production and Consumption of Fear\\" looks at not only the selling of modern horror, but the interpretation of Japanese Horror Cinema by US internet-based fan communities.  The case study for this section is Shimizu Takashi's \\"Ju-On:  The Grudge.\\"<br /><br />The book is very academic in nature, and probably not well-suited for casual fans looking to geek out on their favorite fright flicks.

Instead, he is an unabashed fan who has written a gushing fan book full of excitement and energy, as befits the nature of the subject.  This is not to put any doubt on his knowledge.  Super-fan that he is, one would be hard pressed to find a more knowledgeable expert on the Samurai genre. From the most ludicrous splatterfest to the most powerful and moving drama, Galloway treats each film with respect and notes the quality of its merits on its own terms.<br /><br />Taking this films decade by decade, Galloway highlights the best that each period has to offer.  He kicks things off right with \\"Roshomon\\" and \\"Seven Samurai\\" in the 1950's, moves through the Golden Age of the 60's with such films as \\"Yojimbo,\\" \\"The Tale of Zatoichi,\\" \\"Hara Kiri\\" and \\"Samurai Rebellion,\\" into the 70's with \\"Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart at the River Styx\\" and the \\"Kill Bill\\" inspiration \\"Lady Snowblood:  Blizzard from the Netherworld,\\" the 80's and beyond with \\"Kagemusha,\\" \\"Roningai\\" Kitano Takeshi's \\"Zatoichi\\" and the magnificent \\"Twilight Samurai.\\"  He plucks the absolute best from each era, and leaves you hungry to watch every magnificent offering.<br /><br />Each review is packed with information on story, actors and historical setting.  Ever a fan instead of a scholar, Galloway refuses to give away endings or crucial plot points, so that the films can still be fully enjoyed by eager viewers.  The availability of each film is also rated, and Galloway specifically tries to review accessible films, rather than long out-of-print obscurities.<br /><br />Along with his great reviews, he has side galleries such as the \\"Character Actor Hall of Fame,\\" with bios of all those guys you see hanging around the various Samurai flicks, but never quite put a name too, and tidbits from \\"Takuan the Know-It-All Priest,\\" which offers insight into Japanese Samurai culture, dress and relationships.  He also includes four prefacing essays, \\"The World of the Samurai,\\" \\"The Samurai Film Genre,\\"  \\"The Artists,\\" and \\"Seeing the Films\\" which help set the stage for the film reviews to follow.<br /><br />While always a fan of Samurai flicks, \\"Stray Dogs and Lone Wolves\\" has set me on the path to becoming a full-fledged fanatic.

A dedicated and important pioneer in the field of microbiology and epidemics, the modern world owes much to Noguchi, even though they may not know the extent of the debt.<br /><br />\\"Dr. Nogochi's Journey\\" is a semi-biography of the great doctor's life, and an attempt to reconcile the conflicting portraits of the genius Noguchi and the worthless drunk and spend-thrift Noguchi, both sides of which have been trumpeted in Japan at some time or other.  A semi-biography only, because as in a more-typical style of a Japanese history book a story is told, leaving us privy to quoted dialog and Noguchi's personal inner thoughts, things that the author could not possibly be pulling from authenticated sources.<br /><br />Nogochi definitely lived an interesting life, coming from the grinding, dismal poverty of a poor farming family in Meji Japan, and rising to a level where he could freely introduce friends to the President of the United States and dined with Emperors.  His rise is something achieved by both his own drive, talent and ambition, as well as with the sacrifices of many others who saw something in the child that they believed in.  His club-like left hand, destroyed in a fire when he was just a baby, became the thing that shamed him and spurred him to out-distance his classmates.  He shamelessly begged money and connections from his friends, family and co-workers, little of which was ever payed back.  So single-minded was he that failure was never an option, and he managed to get whatever he needed to go to medical school, to leave Japan, and to discover and cure ravaging epidemic diseases like syphilis, rocky mountain fever, the bubonic plague, and the devastating yellow fever.<br /><br />An interesting idea in \\"Dr. Noguchi's Journey\\" is that Noguchi, while considered a national hero in Japan, could never have achieved anything in his home country.  He is, in many ways, a symbol of the limitation of Japanese culture, where seniority and connections matter more than drive and talent.  Only by traveling to the US could Noguchi rise to a necessary level to leverage his talents and bring relief to a suffering world. Indeed, Japan was one of the last countries to recognize this expatriate during his lifetime.<br /><br />I found his life fascinating, as well as the musings on the nature of genius, that it is not a matter of brains and talents so much as an environment where those brains and talents are allowed to reach fruition.  Without his army of benefactors, Noguchi would probably never have amounted to more than a local farmer, if even that.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with \\"Dr. Noguchi's Journey\\" is either the writing style or the translation, although I do not know which.  The opening chapters are severely heavy-handed and full of pathos and purple prose in the descriptions of the sacrifices and struggles of Noguchi's suffering mother.  I well know that this sort of writing is typical of the Japanese style and language, especially when dealing with sufferings mothers, but it comes off as strange in English.  Perhaps the translator adjusted his style as the book went along, because this aspect is smoothed out and the writing itself becomes more enjoyable along with the story.llow fever. <br /> <br />An interesting idea in \\"Dr. Noguchi's Journey\\" is that Noguchi, while considered a national hero in Japan, could never have achieved anything in his home country.

In this manner, it is an extremely capable guide and leaves you with the confidence that you can accomplish building your own Japanese-style garden.<br /><br />\\"A Japanese Touch for Your Garden\\" tells both the basic elements of a Japanese garden; rocks, plants, water, artificial elements, and also provides a blueprint for laying out and constructing a garden using these elements.  Although packed with lovely pictures, the book is straight-forward and bare-boned, giving you the essentials of what you need.  The authors briefly touches upon garden philosophy and such, but acknowledges that there are other, thicker books for the esoteric matters and they will focus on the practical.<br /><br />The different sections of the book deal with things such as stone lanterns, bamboo fences, bridges, plants and trees...basically everything you will need.  The focus is one how to select and use these available elements for the existing space you have to work with, and how to maximize them for the effect you want to achieve.  The rear of the book also contains a guide of Japanese gardens in the US that you can visit, and suppliers of the various items you may want for your garden.<br /><br />An excellent book, it is exactly what you need if there is a spare portion of your house or yard where you would like to put a Japanese garden.  For a more deeper, spiritual look at Japanese gardens, look elsewhere.  But to be inspired and begin construction on your own \\"World in Miniature,\\" this is the place to start.	2005-08-02

The book is heavier on psychics than ghosts, with quite a bit on mystic healing which is Ross's own forte.  The \\"Strange but True\\" chapter contains some nice weirdness, such as the grave of Jesus Christ in northern Aomori prefecture and the living mummies of Gassan mountain.<br /><br />My personal favorite sections were \\"Modern Day Hauntings\\" and \\"Edo Era Tales.\\"  While I had heard many of the stories before, Ross is well-informed and added some new bits and some new stories, as well as some haunted places to check out.  Her take on the famous \\"Tokaido Yotsuya Kaidan\\" was very nice, with some history of the tale and how it was adapted by various media.<br /><br />Overall, not a great book on the Japanese supernatural, but not terrible either.  It is small, at only 160 pages, but she manages to pack in quite a bit of good stuff.	2005-07-31

It gets even worse at an upper level when the mysterious \\"hodo\\"s and \\"kana\\"s start rearing their ugly heads.  Particles are one of the most confusing aspects of Japanese, and one of the biggest road blocks to conversational fluency.<br /><br />Every student of Japanese could use \\"How to Tell the Difference Between Japanese Particles.\\"  It is a practical, concise little book that contains a wealth of information.  Unlike Naoko Chino's previous particle book, \\"All About Particles,\\"  this volume contains practice exercises and demonstrations of the most common mistakes of Japanese particles.  It is more of a workbook, that should be followed from start to finish.<br /><br />Chino takes several similar but confusing particles, such as \\"particles indicating time\\" or \\"particles used for comparison,\\" then highlights the different usages of each particle, along with demonstration sentences in both English, kana and romaji.  Like all good Japanese books, the emphasis is on the kana, with the romaji and English doing support work.  After each chapter, there are several quizzes to test your new knowledge.  The book closes with an overall test on the entire book.<br /><br />The comparative nature of this book, along with the repeated quizzes, make \\"How to Tell the Difference Between Japanese Particles\\" one of the most useful Japanese study guides that I own.  It serves a niche purpose, but a very useful and necessary one.	2005-07-31

Assembled during the golden age of the Nara period,  it is a massive, multi-volumed multi-authored anthology, collecting poems praising the Imperial family, retelling old folktales and legends, revealing the sublime glory of nature, and the evocative power of love.<br /><br />\\"Love Songs from the Man'Yoshu\\" combs though this massive text and distills out 35 gems of fire, passion, longing and sexuality, emotions that still drive the human race some 1,200 years later.  The edition is bilingual, in both English and Japanese, with flawless translations by Ian Levy. Each poem is paired with a striking Kiri-e (Cut paper) piece by the late master Myata Masayuki, and with commentary by Ooka Makoto setting the stage and filling in the background of the period.<br /><br />The Nara period was a time of some covert sexual freedom, where men and women did not live together, even married couples, and women awaited visitors who came cloaked in the cover of darkness, arriving at dusk and leaving at the first light of dawn.  These visits were prefaced by a subtle dance of seduction, played out over coded love poems exchanged and answered by refined courtiers.  Another man's wife was considered the most exotic and seductive of women, and the games of love had many enthusiastic players.<br /><br />Whose words are these,<br /><br />  spoken to the wife of another?<br /><br />Whose words are these,<br /><br />  that bade me untie<br /><br />  the sash of my robe?<br /><br />Other flavor's of lover are on display as well, from a young girl who can not bear to utter the name of her secret love, for fear her emotions would be revealed to him, to a man waxing romantically on the cherry blossoms he is viewing, and how more complete it would be if his companion where here to view them together.  All of the poems are intensely private and emotional, filled with the kind of depth that only a society as culturally rigid and bound as Japan's could engender.<br /><br />Aside from these beautiful and ancient poems, Miyata Masayuki's artwork is enough reason alone to buy \\"Love Songs from the Man'Yoshu.\\"  Erotically charged scenes of beautiful women in various states of dress and undress are presented with both a spry whimsy and a fierce, fiery passion.  Using his art form of cut paper, Masayuki makes the lines of the trees and the curves of the women's bodies flow together flawlessly, contrasting the bright colors of the kimono's and seasonal flowers with the stark white of their skin and deep black of their hair.<br /><br />I shall not take a brush<br /><br />  to this hair that lies<br /><br />  dishevelled in the morning,<br /><br />for it retains the touch<br /><br />of my dear lord's arms that pillowed me.as culturally rigid and bound as Japan's could engender. <br /> <br />Aside from these beautiful and ancient poems, Miyata Masayuki's artwork is enough reason alone to buy \\"Love Songs from the Man'Yoshu.\\"  Erotically charged scenes of beautiful women in various states of dress and undress are presented with both a spry whimsy and a fierce, fiery passion.

Compelling, due to its flamboyant and exotic nature, with the outrageous flair of Kabuki, and the obfuscation and mystery of the masks of Noh and the puppets of Bunraku.  Uninviting, because of the ancient and ceremonial language, the centuries old symbolism and buried nature of the storyline.  Even to Japanese people, the worlds of Japanese theater can be a complex and incomprehensible realm, requiring significant amounts of study before appreciation.  Like Shakespeare, the more familiar one becomes with the meter of the language and the flow of the story, the more one can enjoy the pathos and humor.<br /><br />\\"A Guide to the Japanese Stage\\" is a fine introduction to Japanese theater, both traditional and contemporary.  It showcases the four main styles of traditional theater, Kabuki, Noh, Bunraku and Kyogen, then offers a whirlwind tour of all the variety of modern plays and dances.  The traditional theaters are covered in-depth, complete with popular play synopsises, styles of make-up, origins, famous actors, clothing and a surprising amount of detail for such a manageable book.<br /><br />Packed with photographs, the stunning visual element is richly displayed.  While definitely not a photo-book, \\"A Guide to Japanese Stage\\" illustrates the text with examples of wigs, masks, puppets and all the stunning flair that is a hallmark of Japanese theater.  There is a nice collection of Yakusha-e, popular woodblock prints of Kabuki actors that have been sold over the years during performances.  Further illustrations detail the male, female and special masks of Noh, the significance of the make-up styles of kumadori Kabuki make-up and the various quick costume changes and special effects of Kabuki.<br /><br />Unlike most books on Japanese theater, modern theater is given its due as well, covering such things as Super Kabuki, Takarazuka's all-woman musical revue, Western-influenced Shingeki, and the grotesque dance of Butoh.  Japan's theatrical tradition certainly doesn't end with the four classic styles, and an amazing breadth of work is on display.  This is a rarely-covered area, and very interesting.<br /><br />Immediately after reading \\"A Guide to the Japanese Stage,\\" I went to see a Kabuki performance and it was astounding how much more appreciation I had from previous performances I had seen.  Able to recognize the \\"mie\\" poses, knowing the purpose of the onnagata dance, and able to piece together the plot from the \\"typical play\\" synopsises of the book, it was a much more rewarding experience.

Almost everyone who has gone through the US school system has encountered O Henry at some point or other, most likely in \\"Gift of the Magi,\\" but the remainder of his catalog is not as generally well-known.<br /><br />This volume, # 11 in the Graphic Classics series, has some of the most variety of the series.  From cowboy adventure yarns to morality tales to straight, melancholy tragedies, O Henry seems to have written a little bit of everything.  The majority of the Graphic Classics series have focused on horror, which seems really suited to the format, but it is great to see that adventure has a place as well.<br /><br />This volume contains:<br /><br />\\"An Unfinished Story\\" - A quick snippet about exactly who qualifies for heaven.<br /><br />\\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\" - A cartoonish take on a Dennis the Menace-style tale of kidnapping  a spoiled bully.<br /><br />\\"The Caballero's Way\\" - A brilliant tale of the Cisco Kid, famed bandit and caballero.  The illustrations are superb, completely complementing the romantic nature of the yarn.  Ah, for the love of Tonia Perez, what would we all not dare?  I could happily buy a whole book in this style.<br /><br />\\"The Gift of the Magi\\" - THE classic O Henry tale, illustrated by Graphic Classics's regular Lisa K. Weber.  Her pretty art adds the necessary touch on this familiar and beautiful story.<br /><br />\\"After 20 Years\\" - A clever story of friendship, with the art giving the right rough and ready feel.  Touching and sad.<br /><br />\\"A Strange Story\\" -  A VERY strange story, with cartoonish illustrations.  A funny break from the heavy tales preceding.<br /><br />\\"The Marionettes\\" - Rick Geary's Victorian style is great for this story of free will, heroes and villains, and why people do what they do.<br /><br />\\"The Furnished Room\\" - A straight-forward tragedy, full of loneliness and death.<br /><br />\\"Roads of Destiny\\" - The struggling peasant/poet David takes three paths through life, but all lead to the same destiny.  Three different illustrators lends power to the adaptation.<br /><br />\\"The Friendly Call\\" - An odd tale of loyalty and friendship.<br /><br />\\"A Madison Square Arabian Night\\" - A dilettante's dismay, a photograph of a woman...<br /><br />\\"The Eye of the Beholder\\" - An artist who paints souls rather than appearance, finds that not everyone appreciates having their true nature revealed.t-forward tragedy, full of loneliness and death. <br /> <br />\\"Roads of Destiny\\" - The struggling peasant/poet David takes three paths through life, but all lead to the same destiny.

While not the avante guard genius of Haruki Murakami, she is a respected and popular author of crime fiction, with quite a few books to her credit, and some movie adaptations as well.  \\"Shadow Family\\" (original Japanese title \\"R.P.G.\\" ) is her second book to be translated into English, following the excellent \\"All She was Worth.\\"<br /><br />\\"Shadow Family\\" covers the murders of middle-aged husband and father Ryosuke Tokoroda and his college-age lover Naoko Imai.  Through the course of the investigation, it is uncovered that Tokoroda had an online \\"family,\\" where he role-played the loving father to a make-believe wife, daughter and son.  In real life he was a cold and selfish philanderer, but online he became the loving, supportive father that every child dreams of.<br /><br />Aside from a few expositionary chapters, it is a \\"single-room\\" mystery, not unlike \\"12 Angry Men,\\" where all the tension takes place in a police interrogation chamber.  The investigators and the suspects engage in a battle of wills, each trying to get the other to slip up and make a mistake, in a fencing match of \\"Who knows what.\\"  One by one Tokoroda's online \\"family\\" is called in, while his real-life daughter Kazumi watches from behind the 2-way mirror, peeling away the layers of mystery that were her father.<br /><br />\\"Shadow Family\\" is not as strong a book as \\"All She was Worth,\\" but is still an engrossing read and a real page-turner.  The opening expositionary chapters are slow, and it takes awhile to get into the pace of the book.  Once all the players are assembled in the interrogation room, however, the story takes off and the psychological fencing begins.<br /><br />It is no real challenge to identify the killer, and the \\"Whodunnit?\\" joy of the book comes about 2/3 of the way in.  From there, it is a pleasure to watch the pieces of the well-laid trap fall into place.  Some of  the characters are very interesting sketches, and I would love to see them explored in another book, where they are allowed more depth to develop.  Unfortunately, at under 200 pages, \\"Shadow Family\\" does not allow for deep characters, but is more an exercise of an interesting trap.<br /><br />Very enjoyable over all, and I will definitely be keeping up with future Miyabe books as they are translated.g sketches, and I would love to see them explored in another book, where they are allowed more depth to develop.

But like his other famous creation, Dr. Jekyll, Stevenson had his darker face, and some tales not so happy.<br /><br />It is this darker side at play in \\"Graphic Classics: Robert Louis Stevenson.\\"  In the same vein as the Edgar Allen Poe and HP Lovecraft collections, Stevenson is presented in his justifiable role as a master of the weird tale, at play in the fields of the human psyche.  Fitting collaborators have been found for each story, lending new elements and insight to the already insightful tales.<br /><br />Included in this volume are:<br /><br />The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde - The key tale of this collection, and a brilliant adaptation.  Two artists are given reign, with a transformation of art as Mr. Hyde takes over.  The basics of this story are as familiar as Dracula and Frankenstein, but I had never actually read the authentic original until now.<br /><br />Verses and Fables - Taking from Stevenson's vast collection of poems and short stories, this is a showcase of erotic, fantastic and sometimes brutal fables.  \\"The Land of Nod\\" is a poem I have loved since I was a child, but didn't know it was Stevenson.  \\"Now Bare to the Beholders\\" eye is a seductive poetic striptease, with gorgeous illustrations.<br /><br />A Brief Literary Life - As in other collections, a brief illustrated biography of Stevenson.  Full of witty illustrations and references.<br /><br />The Suicide Club - A dark tale of bored dilettantes seeking excitement, who wind up with more than they bargained for.  An evil game of chance and men who seek death.<br /><br />The Crumb Brothers on Treasure Island - Maxon Crumb tells the true tale of how Stevenson famously influenced the comic legends Robert and Charles Crumb.

His book \\"No Longer Human\\" is an unquestioned classic of Japanese literature, with its themes of societal alienation and personal decline.  His tragic life was marked by three suicide attempts, until he finally \\"got it right,\\" drowning in a river with his married mistress.  But this is not that Dazai.<br /><br />\\"Blue Bamboo: Japanese Tales of Fantasy\\" is the other Dazai, with a mind full of fantasy, steeped in Brother's Grimm fairy tales and Japanese folklore.  This is the author of children's stories and happy endings.  Well, as happy as and ending gets in Japanese literature, at any rate.  Certainly happier than Dazai's own ending.<br /><br />Collecting seven fairy tales and fantasy stories, \\"Blue Bamboo\\" is an absolutely charming book, mixing the best of German and Japanese folklore into something unique that represents neither.  Dazai's style is light and capturing, and it is hard not to finish this book a few days after you crack the cover.  Each story is a tasty little morsel that beckons the consumption of the next.<br /><br />Two stories, \\"Of Love and Beauty\\" and \\"Lanterns of Romance\\" center around the Irie family, an artistic bunch who pass the time by telling chain stories, starting with one family member who writes a page or two and then passes it on.  Each of the family members are distinct, so each of the relayed chapters are distinct and yet completely fitting.  \\"Lanterns of Romance,\\" the longest in \\"Blue Bamboo,\\" begins with the tale of Rapunzel, but becomes something completely different and wholly satisfying.<br /><br />\\"Cherry Trees and the Whistler,\\" \\"The Chrysanthemum Spirit\\" and \\"The Mermaid and the Samurai\\" are pure Japanese folktales, complete with melancholy ending that is somehow redemptive.  These three miniature yarns balance out the longer entries in the book.<br /><br />\\"Blue Bamboo\\" and \\"Romanesque\\" are the finest in the collection, each a subtle blend of influences.  \\"Blue Bamboo\\" was taken from Chinese myth, and is a cautionary tale about evoking the Gods for selfish reasons, and the ever important power of love.  \\"Romanesque\\" is a quirky and seemingly-unconnected telling of the lives of three men, Taro the Wizard, Jirobei the Fighter and Sabruo the Liar.  It is entirely possible that a moral is buried somewhere in there, but the stories are so entertaining that you will want to read them a few times hunting for it.<br /><br />People looking for good, entertaining fairy tales would really enjoy \\"Blue Bamboo: Japanese Tales of Fantasy,\\" and that is a rare thing to say for a book of Japanese folktales.

A classic of Japanese literature  is Kamo no Chomei's \\"Account of a 10-Foot-Square Hut.\\"  Traditional Japanese homes are built to be convertible, to maximise space with collapsible furniture that can be stored and multipurpose rooms that can have walls removed to create bigger spaces when necessary.<br /><br />Building on this need and tradition is the current architectural Small House movement, where new homes are built on miniature lots, maximizing the space with a surprising efficiency.  There are TV shows and books galore on the topic in Japan, and the ideas are starting to creep over in to the US as well, with book such as \\"The Very Small Home: Japanese Ideas For Living Well In Limited Space.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Very Small Home\\" is a showcase for some of these architectural marvels, eighteen of them to be precise.  Each building begins with a different problem to be solved; an ancient tree that must be accommodated by law, a tiny lot in Tokyo that needs to fit two houses.  My favorite is the family who each inherited a portion of their parents home.  One child inherited the driveway, and needed a long, thin house where he could live in on his section of the land.  Going for a traditional feel, the architect created one of the most beautiful homes in the book, complete with tiny garden and a luxurious traditional bath.  Many of the solutions are quite ingenious, and the photographs of the homes are beautiful to look at.<br /><br />What the book is not is a guide to better utilizing existing small-space homes.  These are definitely architectural solutions, not interior design or decorating solutions.  A lot of money went into these houses, and unless you are willing to completely tear down and rebuild your little living space, there won't be much here for you.<br /><br />For what it is, however, the books succeeds very well, and those interested in architecture as well as those looking to build a small home of their own will probably be amazed at the creativity and beauty of these buildings.  The homes are much more modern than traditional, featuring the sparsity of modern Japanese design.  I can't help but think of a master-crafted piece of sushi, reverently sitting on a pristine white plate.  Small, but incredible.r /> <br />For what it is, however, the books succeeds very well, and those interested in architecture as well as those looking to build a small home of their own will probably be amazed at the creativity and beauty of these buildings.

These are not adjectives usually associated with classic Japanese literature or with Natsume Soseki, an author whose image graces the 1,000 yen note in Japan.  Soseki's intense novel \\"Kokoro\\"  (which translates as \\"heart\\" or \\"spirit\\") is famed for its insight into the Japanese soul.  But he was a young man once too,  who laughed and loved and mocked,  and this early comic novel is no less penetrating for its sense of humor.<br /><br />\\"Botchan\\" is the classic City Mouse tale.  Botchan is a Tokyo boy, through and through.  Lazy, unmotivated, and spoiled by the housekeeper who raised him, he suddenly finds himself needing to make his own way in the world when his father dies and his older brother inherits the fortune.  Thinking school is easier than work, Botchan takes his brother's offer to pay his way through university.  Life is good so far, but even Botchan must graduate, and he finds himself educated and assigned as a middle school teacher in a rural town in the island of Shikoku, Japan's most rural island.  Arrogant and sure of his superiority over the hicks, Botchan quickly runs afoul of the locals and winds up in a merry war with both students and co-teachers.<br /><br />Reminiscent of the best of Mark Twain's yarns, \\"Botchan\\" is layers upon layers of wit and hijinks.  A short, snappy novel, the narrator's own self-assurance blinds him from the mechanisms against him that are so obvious to the reader.  All the townspeople are pure characters, each with their own Botchan-given nickname such as \\"Porcupine,\\" \\"The Hanger-on\\" or \\"Redshirt.\\"  Twined into the story is Botchan's protective elderly maid, Kiyo, who's blind support and admiration of Botchan only feeds his swelled ego, yet adds a touching element of humanity to the tale.<br /><br />Added to all this is Soseki's brilliant insight into the Japanese school system.  Over 100 years later, little has changed and I laughed out loud as Botchan experienced things that I experience every day as a teacher at a Japanese high school.  To see a Japanese person, especially one as revered as Soseki, voicing the very thoughts in my head is an absolute pleasure.  Anyone wanting an authentic insiders look into Japanese society and culture would do much better laying down their copy of \\"The Enigma of Japanese Power\\" and picking up a copy of \\"Botchan.\\"<br /><br />J. Cohn's translation is perfect, preserving both the humor and the insight, and manages to portray the class differences of the Tokyo and Shikoku dwellers without resorting to cheap tricks like using Southern US accents and such.  He must have a great sense of humor himself, and I look forward to more translations from him.<br /><br />Insightful and penetrating, a window behind the hidden doors of Japan, \\"Botchan\\" is also hands-down the most entertaining Japanese novel I have ever read.  Highly, highly recommended.t I experience every day as a teacher at a Japanese high school.

Tom Mes and Jaspar Sharp's website covers film reviews, interviews, DVD releases, feature articles, a calendar of events and film festivals, and absolutely anything an interested person would want to know.  With such a pedigree, there are no more qualified people to write a guide of this kind.<br /><br />\\"The Midnight Eye Guide to New Japanese Film\\" is as excellent as one would expect, an essential book for those interested in modern Japanese film.  The layout is well-balanced, covering director profiles and film reviews, using both original material and previously featured articles.  The writing is crisp and clear, and each chapter provides insight even on topics where one is knowledgeable.  Over 100 photos show some of the visual highlights of this visual media.<br /><br />Each chapter focuses on a director, from history to motivation to style, with a review of that director's top five or six films.  Being new Japanese film, the profiles begin in 1956 with Seijin Suzuki (\\"Elegy to Fighting,\\" \\"Tokyo Drifter\\"), a complicated and controversial director.  With the Criterion Collection currently making a push of Suzuki's catalog on DVD, this makes a great starting point and leaves me looking forward to each new release.  All of the major directors are profiled, such as Shohei Imamura (\\"The Eel\\"), Kinji Fukasaku (\\"Battles without Honor and Humanity\\" \\"Battle Royale\\") Masato Harada (\\"Bounce KoGals\\"),  Kiyoshi Kurosawa (\\"Cure\\"), Studio Ghibli luminaries Isao Takahata (\\"Grave of the Fireflies\\") and Hayao Miyazaki (\\"Spirited Away\\"), Takeshi Kitano (\\"Hanabi\\"), Takashi Miike (\\"Ichi the Killer,\\" \\"Audition\\"), Hirokazu Kore-eda (\\"After Life\\"), and Hideo Nakata (\\"The Ring\\").  Other, lesser-known directors are also given their due, such as Nara-based naturalist Naomi Kawase (\\"Suzaku.\\")<br /><br />The final section covers what they call \\"The Other Players,\\" those who have put out a film or two of exceptional quality but hadn't yet established a solid career in the same rank.  Animator Satoshi Kon's \\"Perfect Blue,\\" Masayuki Suo's \\"Shall We Dance?,\\" Mamoru Oshii's \\"Avalon,\\" Juzo Itami's \\"Tampopo\\" and Mitsuo Yanagimachi's \\"Fire Festival\\" are all given their due.  More than just simple film-reviews, the authors pack each spotlight with as much interest and insight as their director profiles.<br /><br />With Donald Richie's seminal \\"100 Years of Japanese Film\\" covering the past, it is great to see such a qualified inheritor of the future.

Certain phrases that you will encounter make no sense if translated literally (\\"Hako-iri Musume\\" - \\"Daughter in a Box\\"), and can only be understood in the context of the society they are a part of. (A sheltered girl who is taken care of by her parents like a doll in a protective box.)<br /><br />Kitterdge Cherry understands this, and has tackled a specific part of Japanese language/culture, that of Japan's view of women as expressed through the language.  In this book, \\"Womansword: What Japanese words say about women,\\" she has combed through the female-specific vocabulary and supplied a cultural background for each word or phrase. In this manner, she has written an interesting book that not only offers new vocabulary but also provides some valuable insight.<br /><br />As a vocabulary builder, \\"Womansword\\" is limited but useful.  Many of the terms are outdated, as the book was written in 1987, and many of the words have not been used commonly for more than 60 years. However, when reading Japanese literature, or living daily life in Japan, I have encountered enough of the vocabulary presented here to have been glad that I read the book.  Most of these are \\"casual words,\\" the types of things you are likely to find in Manga or daily chit-chat than anything else.  I recommend you check with a Japanese friend before using the majority of these words though.  I have busted some out and found later that they were inappropriate, a distinction that Cherry does not make.<br /><br />As a cultural book it is more successful.  Cherry, who is an activist as a lesbian minister in the US,  keeps the tone of the book neutral and non-judgemental, something which I really appreciated.  In a book like this it would be easy to condemn Japanese culture, but education<br /><br />and elucidation are the genuine aims.  Japan's treatment of women has come a long way since 1987, but it is still a very different culture from the US, one where gender differences are more acknowledged, and gender roles more accepted.  Books such as \\"Womansword\\" can help to put this in perspective.is still a very different culture from the US, one where gender differences are more acknowledged, and gender roles more accepted.

After this wretched day, she saves a cat from being hit by a car, using her lacrosse racket, which is broken in the rescue.  Much to her shock and surprise, the earring-wearing cat then stands up, bows, and thanks her for her assistance.  A sequence of cat-related incidents follow, until finally Haru follows the massively fat kitty Muta (returning from \\"Whispers of the Heat\\") into the home of Baron, a suave, adventuring cat of sophistication and style.<br /><br />Baron's house leads to a Cat World, where Haru is quickly kidnapped to become the bride of the Cat Prince whom she saved.  However, for this to work Haru must be transformed into a cat herself, a proposition which she does not like at all.  Appealing to the Baron and Muta, Haru attempts to escape the Cat World and find her way back home.<br /><br />\\"Baron: The Cat Returns\\" is a charming story in the Alice in Wonderland mode, with Haru very much the stranger in a strange land.  Baron is a dashing character, a tuxedo-wearing swordfighter who is always willing to help a lady in distress.  Muta is a perfect sidekick, rough and ready to scrap with anyone.  A great comic for kids, it is a straight-forward fantasy adventure with enough surprises and delights to keep entertaining.<br /><br />Two of Hiiragi Aoi's manga in this series, \\"Whispers of the Heart\\" and \\"The Cat Returns,\\" were adapted into animated films by Japan's most renowned animators at Studio Ghibli.  Although \\"Baron: The Cat Returns\\" is the third in the series, due to its nature it can be read alone without any previous knowledge of the preceding books.gh surprises and delights to keep entertaining. <br /> <br />Two of Hiiragi Aoi's manga in this series, \\"Whispers of the Heart\\" and \\"The Cat Returns,\\" were adapted into animated films by Japan's most renowned animators at Studio Ghibli.

Here, it's part two of the school trip, with the kids in Kyoto facing off against menaces of their own creation as well as new challenges<br /><br />The Kissing Contest in the first section is hilarious, with Asakura and Chamo arranging a contest amongst the students to see who will be the first to kiss Negi.  Of course, things never go as planned, and hijinks ensue, even in this unorthodox situation.  The romance between Negi and Nodoka heats up from her attempted confession last issue, and Nodoka is determined to be the kisser.  However, there are some unexpected twists, and even the stalwart Yue reveals secret longings and gets into the game.<br /><br />Next up is the revelation of new player, Kotaro, who challenges Negi and Asuna, after isolating them from the rest of the crew.  Nadoka's new abilities are revealed, and she lends a hand to the two battlers. (Powers which manage to flip up her skirt every time they are used.  Ahhh...Akamatsu...)  Kotaro is a great new character, one who will play an even larger part as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Finally, a trip to Movie Village in Kyoto, famed as the place where Samurai dramas are filmed, allows for more action from  Konoka and Setsuna.  This is a good chance to get the gals in period costumes,  and for Sestuna to play the Knight Errant.<br /><br />Volume 5 is a somewhat transitional book, setting the stage for the climatic battle that will come in future volumes, and allowing some of the girl's to get charged up.  It is nice to see the Konoka/Setsuna storyline expanded on, and Kotaro is a great character and an interesting foil for Negi.	2005-05-24

A wandering spirit, he traveled across his home nation during a time when travel was dangerous, arduous, and almost impossible to the average citizen.  Not only did he perfect his medium, the haiku, during his travels, but he also introduced the rare sights of Japan to his audience, painting a canvas of imagery that few would ever be able to see with their own eyes.<br /><br />Unfortunately,this classic work is not fully realized in this translation.  The translator, Nobuyuki Yuasa, is himself not a native speaker of English.  Poetic translation is difficult under any circumstances, and when translating into a non-native language the task is made even more difficult.  Yuasa makes use of fairly grandiose English words where Basho used simple language, and he attempts to fill in perceived gaps of foreign understanding with additional lines not included in the original.  (Example: Basho's most famous poem includes the stanza \\"Mizu no oto\\" literally \\"The Sound of Water.\\" Yuasa has given this as \\"A Deep Resonance\\" )  Yuasa also made use of a 4-stanza method of translating the haiku, which he defends in the introduction, but does not transfer the original intent of the form.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the original Japanese versions of the haiku are not included, so a capable reader is not even able to attempt their own understanding.<br /><br />Included in this single volume are several of Basho's travelogues, including \\"The Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton,\\" \\"A Visit to Kashima Shrine,\\" \\"The Records of a Travel-Worn Satchel\\" and \\"A Visit to Sarasina Village.\\"  The works are heavily end-noted, to clarify culture terms and names of note.  Unfortunately, this is another flaw in the volume, as the end-notes are often short, and checking them interrupts the flow of the tale.  Foot-notes would have been a better choice.<br /><br />For a more capable translation of Basho's poetry, see Makoto Ueda's biography \\"Matsuo Basho.\\"  Hopefully in the future a better translation of all of these wonderful and important travelogues will be issued.hoice. <br /> <br />For a more capable translation of Basho's poetry, see Makoto Ueda's biography \\"Matsuo Basho.\\"  Hopefully in the future a better translation of all of these wonderful and important travelogues will be issued.	2005-05-22

Foreign visitors are often horrified to see the bottle of red that they ordered arrive straight from the refrigerator, nicely chilled.  The national beverages are beer and whiskey along with native drinks sake and shochu.  Beer, whiskey, sake and shochu are all wonderful tipples, but often wine-lovers would like to pop a bottle of something to go along with their Japanese feast.  Chef Machiko Chiba and Wine Expert JK Whelehan decided to take up this challenge, and have assembled a fine collection of paired-dishes in this cookbook, \\"Japanese Dishes for Wine Lovers.\\"<br /><br />Chiba has created a selection of dishes more \\"wine friendly\\" than traditional Japanese foods, fishes with thick sauces and light vegetable salads that would never appear in a restaurant in Japan.  As she states in her introduction, these are dishes that she created over the years working in New York, adapting Japanese foods to suit Western tastes and trying to create dishes that partner better with the more wine-friendly West.  Ingredients bounce back and forth between Western and Japanese, with interesting blends such as the \\"Avocado Tofu Salad\\" and \\"Seafood with Carrot Dressing.\\"  There is a good blend of vegetable, meat and fish dishes to suit any eating habits.<br /><br />Whelenan has taking these dishes, and found a reciprocal wine to go with each creation.  In his introduction, Whelenan talks about the needs of pairing wines with the Asian taste of \\"umami,\\" a fifth taste associated with Asian food separate from sweet, sour, salty and bitter.  His essay on umami is quite enlightening in itself, and a very interesting read.  He also touches on traditional Japanese ingredients such as soy sauce, mirin, wasabi, and shichimi seven-spice pepper, and the challenges of matching wine to each flavoring.  His choices favor sparkling wines, which emulate the bubbles and freshness of the beer traditionaly served with these dishes, and champagne is a definite favorite to accompany foods such as sushi.<br /><br />The flaws in \\"Japanese Dishes for Wine Lovers\\" are in two main areas.  First,  Chiba, a professional chef, has created recipes with ingredients that are obscure and difficult to find even in a Japanese grocery store, and a specialty store will need to be found in order to make these recipes as written.  Some, such as the Japanese citrus fruit yuzu, are quite necessary but many more serve as little more than a garnish and can be substituted easily.  Unfortunately, Chiba does not make any suggestions for substitutions for these hard-to-find ingredients or suggestions as to where to acquire them, so you are on your own.  Secondly, Whelenan has paired a separate wine for every single dish, many of which are little more than appetizers.  The portions are all quite small, in keeping with Japanese-style serving of many dishes of small sizes. An extraordinary number of bottles of wine would need to fill a table if one cooked a meal based on this cookbook.  A few balanced courses would have been nice, with a single wine that would work for the meal.<br /><br />From this, \\"Japanese Dishes for Wine Lovers\\" succeeds as a cookbook first, and as wine-paring advice second.  Chiba's recipes are innovative and delicious.  The \\"Salmon Marinated in Sake,\\" \\"Silver Cod Simmered in Spicy Miso,\\"  \\"Tofu and Salmon Stuffed Peppers\\" and \\"Deep-Fried Sea Bream with Burdock\\" have all been absolutely delicious.  The dishes are presentation-quality, great for inviting friends over for a meal when you are looking to impress, and with flavors balanced enough to suit Western and Japanese tastes.  Whelenan's introduction serves as mini-lesson on pairing wine to this type of food, and an adventurous host will probably be able to use that just as much as his specific advice when planning and preparing a meal.champagne is a definite favorite to accompany foods such as sushi. <br /> <br />The flaws in \\"Japanese Dishes for Wine Lovers\\" are in two main areas.

That is what separates Donald Richie from the numerous authors of that swollen genre,  \\"books on Japan.\\" Throughout his career, he has concocted a subtle blend, both of his own perspective and that of the people in a land foreign to him but home to them.  He has shown Japan as a living place populated by these people, as opposed to of a set of cultural rules to be memorized, food to be eaten and temples to be visited.<br /><br />If Donald Richie offers insight into Japan, then \\"The Donald Richie Reader: 50 Years of Writing on Japan\\"  gives a similar insight into Richie.  An anthology, or course, it sifts through Richie's lifetime of work and condenses the finest, most representative pieces.  A keen observer, Richie acknowledges his own eyes as part of the observation process.  He is, first and foremost, a writer, and the fact that Japan is his muse is only a lucky happenstance.  The essays and chapters here are as much about Donald Richie as they are about Japan.<br /><br />From masterpieces like \\"The Inland Sea\\" and \\"Ozu\\" to unpublished fiction like \\"The View from the Chuo Line,\\"  Richie's unique insight can be gleaned from this volume in a way that no single book could encapsulate. Some of his rarest works, such as \\"The Erotic Gods,\\" his 1966 anthropological study of Japan's fading phallic religions,  can possibly only be found in this volume.  Same to this are passages from his first book, \\"Where are the Victors?,\\" giving a rare view on Occupation Japan, when Richie first arrived.<br /><br />A further look into Richie is the excellent and long introduction by Arturo Silva.  Heavily foot-noted and photo-referenced, the introduction sets the stage for the journey into Richie's psyche that you are about to take.  The photos make Richie human, from the young robustness of his early days in Japan, to the wisdom of the Old Guarde that Richie has become.  It is amazing how many Japanese people of note that Richie has known.  Kawabata Yasunari, Ozu Yasujiro, Mishima Yukio, Kurosawa Akira...<br /><br />\\"The Donald Richie Reader\\" should probably not be your first Donald Richie book.  For that I recommend \\"The Inland Sea\\" to start, and you should probably have a few of his smaller books, such as \\"The Honorable Visitors,\\" under your belt before you come to this anthology.

Using humor and a clear insight into the language, Rubin explains the minor issues that, while seemingly tiny, are the difference between fluency and gibberish.<br /><br />The only drawback is that the book is perhaps a bit too small. Rubin's explanations are clear but brief, and could soon be forgotten. Most of the important bits require re-reading, and a serious student will probably pull \\"Making Sense of Japanese\\" off the shelf quite a few times when encountering something.  Beefing the tiny tome up with some exercises and quizzes would help solidify Rubin's points, making it even more useful than it already is.<br /><br />As it stands, I would qualify this book as \\"essential\\" to Japanese learners at a certain level.

All of the stories are illustrated with funny, cartoonish illustrations, with nothing scary going on at all.<br /><br />The book collects;<br /><br /> \\"The Gratitude of the Crane\\"<br /><br />\\"The Snow Woman\\"<br /><br />\\"The Sparrow's Tounge\\"<br /><br />\\"The Tanuki Band of Shojoji\\"<br /><br />\\"Earless Ho-ichi\\"<br /><br />\\"Banbuku Teakettle\\"<br /><br />\\"Baby Grandma\\"<br /><br />\\"Leave Them and Go\\"<br /><br />The stories are presented with the English and Japanese side by side, at about Jr. High reading level.  As such, the collection is great practice in reading authentic Japanese, where you can check your understanding instantly on the next page.  The kanji is furigana, with hiragana readings above the Chinese characters.<br /><br />There are far more interesting and complete collections of Japanese folk tales available, such as Royall Tyler's \\"Japanese Tales,\\" but having the chance to read them in Japanese is a treat.  One can get bored of text books, and Kodansha's bilingual series, especially \\"Once Upon a Time in Ghostly Japan,\\" can provide a welcome and interesting change.	2005-05-07

To stand in the composed splendor of an authentic Japanese garden, it is easy to believe this, so powerful and rich is the aura of the place.  Any visitor  to Japan will spend at least some time in the famous gardens, wandering and dreaming.  Possibly there are one or two Japanese gardens in your hometown as well, if you are lucky.<br /><br />However, unless you are steeped in the mysteries and culture of  Japanese religion, you would no more understand the deeper symbolism of the place than a lifelong Buddhist would understand the icons of a Catholic church.  Japanese gardens are not mere works of beauty.  In some cases, they are encoded representations of paradise.  In other cases, mediation tools to assist in gaining enlightenment.  In all cases, they are much more than what they appear.<br /><br />Katsuhiko Mizuno has kindly written a guide book, a decoder if  you will, to the delights of the garden.  \\"Styles and Motifs: Japanese Gardens\\"  is an essential book. Mizuno has made simple the complex structure, elucidating the symbology of the naturescape and the intentions of the gardener.  Set into thirty basic motifs, such as \\"Moss Gardens,\\" \\"Sand Designs,\\" \\"Buddhist Trinity Stones\\" and \\"Rock Arrangements Symbolizing Eternal Life,\\"  the book explains and shows examples of typical features.  Each feature is accompanied by a beautiful photograph, and information as to which gardens throughout Japan that particular feature can be found.<br /><br />The book is compact, and spiral bound, making it very convenient to carry and travel with.  Anyone coming to Japan would be happy to have included a copy in their packing.<br /><br /> I have been to Ryoan-ji in Kyoto many times, and each time I can hear people, staring at the famous Dry Landscape Garden (#15 in the book) saying, \\"Its beautiful, but what does it mean? I just don't get it.\\"  If they had a copy of  \\"Styles and Motifs: Japanese Gardens,\\" think of how much richer their experiences would have been!ust don't get it.\\"  If they had a copy of  \\"Styles and Motifs: Japanese Gardens,\\" think of how much richer their experiences would have been! <br />	2005-05-04

Whether you are having a traditional dinner, some sushi, a bowl of udon or even a plate of curry rice, in a Japanese home or restaurant a small dish of pickled yummies will always be set aside your plate, providing a colorful and flavorful accompaniment.<br /><br />Continuing the \\"Quick and Easy\\" series of Japanese cooking, chef Ikuko Hisamatsu has laid out almost 100 easy-to-follow tsukemono recipes that allow you to prepare these necessary side dishes, using seasonal Japanese ingredients which complement the various meals of Japanese cuisine.  In addition to the common tsukemono, there are five Korean kim chee recipes, some dessert items like pineapple in lemon, fish side-dishes like salted squid, and some original creations like garlic in honey and garlic in miso.<br /><br />The ingredient list might require a Japanese or Asian grocery store, unless you have ready access to daikon, shiso leaves, kombu, ume and the like.  Required Japanese spices are things like miso, sake-kasu, karashi, wasabi and yuzu citron.  Nothing terribly rare, but exotic enough that they probably won't be found at a regular grocery store.<br /><br />The recipes are easy to follow.  If you have never done any pickling before, you can expect some trial and error before you get it exactly right.  There are some overall tips for pickling, and advice as to the specific equipment you will need.  Pickling does require some special equipment and preparation, so it is not really a \\"grab and go\\" type of cook book, although there are simple recipes that you can try right away.  The length of time for the recipes vary, and you are probably better off trying a one hour pickle before tackling the two-month long fermentation of the delicious ume boshi.<br /><br />A necessary book for anyone serious about cooking authentic Japanese meals.	2005-05-04

Stepping off the train in Kyoto for the first time can be a disappointing experience for many travelers. People who have fallen in love with the fairy tale of Japan's old capitol, who have absorbed \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" and swooned at photographs of golden temples, paper lanterns, and beautiful, elusive Geisha fleeing quickly through close, wooded back-allies, are shocked to discover a modern, dirty city, overrun with power lines, buses and hotels. Furthermore, it is stacked to the gills with tourists, each seeking their own Kyoto-of-my-dreams. Where are the secret spaces, the ancient houses and quiet tea houses steeped in history? Diane Durston can tell you.<br /><br />If you are anything like me, \\"Old Kyoto: A Guide to Traditional Shops, Restaurants and Inns\\" is the guide to the Kyoto you are looking for. A fascinating and delightful guide to the relics of old Kyoto, the stuff that you see on the post cards but can't seem to find in the city itself, Diane Durston has dredged the sludge of a modern city to find things like Nishiharu, a small tatami-room shop selling authentic Ukiyo-e prints with a proprietor who greets each guest with a cup a tea and a smile, or Ippo-Do, a 140-year old tea shop who's name (\\"One Promise\\") and business is based on a promise to an old customer that they would never sell anything but tea, and Tawara-ya, an inn so beautiful that when the King of Sweden stayed there, he was late for his official tour do to lingering too long in the morning light of the garden.<br /><br />As a guide, \\"Old Kyoto\\" is divided into regions, Central Kyoto, Eastern Kyoto, Western Kyoto, Northern Kyoto and Southern Kyoto, and then showcasing a few treasures of each region, splitting evenly amongst craftwear, antiques, Japanese-style hotels, restaurants and food-sellers. Many of these shops are tiny, without even a sign out in front to advertise their business. Some carry ancient placards announcing them as official providers to the Emperor of their unique offering. All of them are tempting enough to include more than a few when visiting Kyoto.<br /><br />Each entry is a loving, well-written essay, and Diane Durston paints an affectionate picture of the store and its proprietors. You can tell that she carries each of these shops in her heart, and one shop, a traditional bucket-maker, is included in fond remembrance, even though the craftsman himself has passed away with no one to pass his craft to.<br /><br />In addition to the shop introductions, there are a few extras, such as a guide to walks through old Kyoto, and recommended day-trips to places such as Fushimi and Uji which are easily accessible from Kyoto city. While these are a nice addition, there are other, more-inclusive guide books for this kind of thing.<br /><br />\\"Old Kyoto\\" is an essential guide to anyone seeking that city that they have read so much about.

Scholarly in tone, this is a competent book for serious students of Japan, who want more than can be offered by \\"culture\\" books and such.<br /><br />An impressively wide examination, each of the ten chapters examines a particular face of Japan.  Economic class and stratification, varieties in work and labor, diversity and unity in education, minority groups and gender stratification, almost every possible angle is seen.  Popular and folk culture are examined in detail, with the \\"Four Japanese Phenomena\\" described as manga, pachinko, karaoke and the sex industry.  As someone who has spent considerable time in Japan, I can assure that these four areas have more impact on modern Japan than the tea ceremony and the  Japanese garden!<br /><br />Although it is packed with information, \\"An Introduction to Japanese Society\\" is also small enough as to not be intimidating.  It is only an introduction, but it should be a gateway to those seeking insight into a fascinating culture.	2005-04-08

Burroughs's \\"Junky.\\"  The semi-autobiographical novel of disaffected youth and their abusive love-affairs with drink, drugs and sex is certainly not without literary precedence.  Over the years, it has become a genre, one which shocks people with its honestly, and lures with its romanticism of the life of a fringe wastrel, who looks no further than the next drink or fix, living life in pursuit of pleasure.<br /><br />Joining their ranks is \\"Almost Transparent Blue,\\" the debut novel by Japanese virtuoso Ryu Murakami.  This first novel, written while still in collage, won the prestigious  Akutagawa award and skyrocketed Murakami to fame and financial independence.  Telling the semi-connected tales of young junkies Ryu, Kazuo, Yoshiyama, Moko, Reiko, and Kei, the book is a decent into the underbelly of 1970's Japan, fresh with Jimmy Hendrix music, exotic black men from the local military base, and the numbness of emotion that comes from living in a drug-haze.<br /><br />Like his predecessors, Murakami has detailed the life of the Bohemian as an attractive and repulsive existence.  Attractive, due to the seductiveness of a life lived for base pleasure, animalistic sex and a constant supply of drugs.  Repulsive, in the vomit and blood and pain that of necessity accompanies such a lifestyle.  You wonder which characters will escape, which ones will die, and how much of this did Murakami experience first hand.  He never makes it quite clear, naming the lead character \\"Ryu\\" after himself, and leaving the reality of the elusive \\"Lily\\" up in the air with the last paragraph.<br /><br />Very much a product of its time, both the music and the stereotypical \\"otherness\\" of the black people are striking time stamps.  Unfortunately, the translation is dated too. With Japanese literature, you can always tell how old a translation is by how the translate tofu.  Here, it is called \\"bean curd,\\" since tofu had not entered the standard English language yet.  Also, some strange choices were made by the translator, such as changing Kei's Osaka dialect into an American Southern accent.<br /><br />However, flaws aside, \\"Almost Transparent Blue\\" is a powerful milestone in Japanese literature, and a good book as well.

Created during one of the darkest times in Japan's history, in the aftermath following defeat in WWII, Aikido was presented to the shattered nation by its founder Morihei Ueshiba as a method to gain self-reliance and confidence.  Rather than combat, Aikido is an art of training the spirit, the ki.<br /><br />Morihei's son, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, inherited the school of Aikido and decided to enlarge his father's vision to bring Aikido to everyone.  With this in mind, he wrote \\"The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques,\\" a manual to the spiritual discipline and philosophy of Aikido, including an introduction to the core techniques.<br /><br />The book is in three section, Aikido Philosophy, The Essence of Aikido and Aikido Techniques.  Philosophy covers the founder's ideas, the necessity of Ki and Tagatane (\\"Hand Sword\\").  In the next section, Aikido is compared to Judo, and described as a swordsman's art, rather than a system of grappling.  Finally, the actual stances and moves are outlined, with beautiful and useful pictures detailing the actions.<br /><br />Anyone considering Aikido would find this book a treasure, as they would be able to approach their new art with a core understanding of its philosophy and intentions.  Continuing Akidokas would be interested to read the thoughts and ideals of the founder, as passed down through his son.	2005-04-07

I knew him as the author of \\"The Devil's Dictionary,\\" and I knew the story \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\" although I did not know he was the author.  In fact, I knew it mainly as an episode of \\"The Twilight Zone.\\"  With this in mind, it was one of the most exciting volumes to explore, as I was discovering the author and his writings for the first time, through the Graphic Classics vehicle.<br /><br />First off, the very cool cover was definitely a lure for this lesser-known author.  Satan sipping blood cocktails and going over the latest entries in his dictionary was just too good to pass up.  Due to the short nature of Bierce's stories, there is a much wider variety of styles and interpretations inside the book.  It is almost too much to take in one sitting, and I found myself reading a story here and there instead of straight through.  With so much variation, not everything is going to please, but overall I was completely entertained by the author and the artists.<br /><br />This volume contains:<br /><br />\\"The Disappearance of Ambrose Bierce\\" - A nice biographical piece.  Even more interesting as I knew nothing of the story and little of Ambrose Bierce himself.<br /><br />\\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\" - An excellent adaptation of his most-famous story, using what looks like computer graphics.  Very shadowy and with a nice feel.<br /><br />\\"The Race at Left Bower\\" - A funny little bit, with amusing illustrations.<br /><br />\\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" - A selection of entries from the cynical author, juxtaposed with Leslie Murray's own cynical brand of humor.  Very nicely done.<br /><br />\\"An Imperfect Conflagration\\" - Victorian horror illustrator Rick Geary handles this tale of a father-and-son thief team, murder and a fireproof cabinet.  Exactly up Geary's alley.<br /><br />\\"The Stranger\\" - An old west ghost tale, fully illustrated in the style of 1950's Western comics.  Chilling.<br /><br />\\"One Summer Night\\" - A grave robber's tale.  Surrealistic illustrations add to the grim, short tale.<br /><br />\\"Moxon's Master\\"-  Cautionary Sci Fi, a text-and-pictures piece with art-deco illustrations that look as if they came from a fashion magazine.  Not my favorite tale over all.<br /><br />\\"Bierce's Fables\\" - The ultimate mixed bag.  29 stories by just as many different artists.  Something to please, and something to annoy, everyone.  Just the way Bierce would have liked it, I imagine.<br /><br />\\"The Boarded Window\\" - Gahan Wilson handles this odd tale of the dead and not dead.  Almost like \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" in a log cabin.<br /><br />\\"The Hypnotist\\" - An odd tale, with an odd artist.  A good combination.<br /><br />\\"Oil of Dog\\" - One of my favorites.

This new incarnation, however, takes an entirely different tact, combining fantastic literary stories with equally talented artists for something that is far more entertainment than education.<br /><br />Also, while these are \\"comic books,\\" the illustrators are far more \\"New Yorker\\" than \\"Fantastic Four.\\" Creative, individualistic and highly stylized, each artist leaves their own distinctive mark on their story, creating a unique experience, a collaboration between author and artist.<br /><br />This 3rd Edition of \\"Graphic Classics: Volume 1 - Edgar Allan Poe\\" assembles nine short stories and three poems of the master, including his most famous works as well as some less well-known. Each is given a different treatment, ranging from illustrated text pieces to full comic strips. Each is of very high quality, making this book highly recommended.<br /><br />Included in this volume are:<br /><br />\\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\" - My first Edgar Allan Poe story, that I was assigned to read in Jr. High School, is still a provocative and powerful piece. Artist Rick Geary gives us a straight-forward rendition, including a lovingly detailed picture of The Eye.<br /><br />\\"King Pest\\" - A story of plague-ridden London, where two hapless sailors find themselves guests at the table of the King and Queen of pestilence.  Anton Emdin's grotesque illustrations add a nice comic flair to the tale.<br /><br />\\"The Premature Burial\\" - A claustrophobic tale of fear of premature burial, and how we often create the demon's that haunt us.  Joe Ollman does a splendid job of creating atmosphere, and the panic of being buried alive.<br /><br />\\"El Dorado\\" - This one I liked a lot. A semi-humorous cartoons style brings the point of the sad poem home even more fiercely.<br /><br />\\"Spirits of the Dead\\" - A surrealistic adaptation of a quiet Poe poem, ruminating on death.<br /><br />\\"The Imp of the Perverse\\" - Like \\"The Tell-tale Heart,\\" a story of the sting of guilt, and how a perfect murder is never as perfect as we would like to think.<br /><br />\\"The Raven\\" - A new adaptation of Poe's masterpiece, this is an assemble version with a different artist doing a different stanza.  It comes off beautifully, allowing Poe's words to be the true star of the show.<br /><br />\\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" - A text-and-pictures adaptation,full of the stunning delights of Propero's hidden Bohemia, and the plague of the Red Death that intrudes on their party.<br /><br />\\"Never Bet the Devil Your Head\\" - A wild and funny adaptation of a wild and funny story. An excellent ending.<br /><br />\\"Hop-Frog\\" - The text is presented in its entirety, and the artists is so completely well-suited to this story that I think I will forever see the foolish fat king and his eight fat friends as portrayed by artist Lisa K.

Whether it is the short-story nature, or the ready-made visually splendid imagery, there is something in the classic horror tales thats makes them well suited to the Graphic Classics treatment.  Here, in the 10th volume, they have wisely continued this tradition, and assembled an anthology of classic horror stories to chill and delight.<br /><br />\\"Horror Classics\\" brings together 12 authors, some of which, like HP Lovecraft , Jack London and Ambrose Bierce, have been previously honored with their own Graphic Classics collections.

One I have never read before, but am glad to be introduced to.<br /><br />\\"The Thing at Ghent\\" - Honre de Balzac - Entirely dialog free, I am at a bit of a loss as to the actual story.

People who have fallen in love with the fairy tale of Japan's old capitol, who have absorbed \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" and swooned at photographs of golden temples, paper lanterns, and beautiful, elusive Geisha fleeing quickly through close, wooded back-allies, are shocked to discover a modern, dirty city, overrun with power lines, buses and hotels.  Furthermore, it is stacked to the gills with tourists, each seeking their own Kyoto-of-my-dreams.  Where are the secret spaces, the ancient houses and quiet tea houses steeped in history?  Diane Durston can tell you.<br /><br />If you are anything like me, \\"Old Kyoto: A Guide to Traditional Shops, Restaurants and Inns\\" is the guide to the Kyoto you are looking for.  A fascinating and delightful guide to the relics of old Kyoto, the stuff that you see on the post cards but can't seem to find in the city itself,  Diane Durston has dredged the sludge of a modern city to find things like Nishiharu, a small tatami-room shop selling authentic Ukiyo-e prints with a proprietor who greets each guest with a cup a tea and a smile, or Ippo-Do, a 140-year old tea shop who's name (\\"One Promise\\") and business is based on a promise to an old customer that they would never sell anything but tea, and Tawara-ya, an inn so beautiful that when the King of Sweden stayed there, he was late for his official tour do to lingering too long in the morning light of the garden.<br /><br />As a guide, \\"Old Kyoto\\" is divided into regions, Central Kyoto, Eastern Kyoto, Western Kyoto, Northern Kyoto and Southern Kyoto, and then showcasing a few treasures of each region, splitting evenly amongst craftwear, antiques, Japanese-style hotels, restaurants and food-sellers.  Many of these shops are tiny, without even a sign out in front to advertise their business.  Some carry ancient placards announcing them as official providers to the Emperor of their unique offering.  All of them are tempting enough to include more than a few when visiting Kyoto.<br /><br />Each entry is a loving, well-written essay, and Diane Durston paints an affectionate picture of the store and its proprietors.  You can tell that she carries each of these shops in her heart, and one shop, a traditional bucket-maker, is included in fond remembrance, even though the craftsman himself has passed away with no one to pass his craft to.<br /><br />In addition to the shop introductions, there are a few extras, such as a guide to walks through old Kyoto, and recommended day-trips to places such as Fushimi and Uji which are easily accessible from Kyoto city.  While these are a nice addition, there are other, more-inclusive guide books for this kind of thing.<br /><br />\\"Old Kyoto\\" is an essential guide to anyone seeking that city that they have read so much about.  It is still there, you just have to know where too look for it.  Fortunately for us, Diana Durston knows where to look, and has kindly shown us the way.eir unique offering.

Dedicated to war dead, the shrine became a symbol for the Emperor cult of WWII Axis Japan, with Class A war criminals such as General Tojo being honored there.  In modern Japan, it is a last remaining relic, after State Shinto was banned by the US occupation forces, and even today an official visit by a government official creates an uproar in the Asian nations abused by the Japanese army.<br /><br />With this in mind, a book titled \\"The Yasukuni Swords\\" carries the same aura as a book titled \\"The Auschwitz Bayonets\\" or \\"The Mai Lai Guns.\\"  Even amongst Nihonto enthusiasts,  WWII era swords were known for their inferior quality and mass production, handed off to soldiers before being sent off to slaughter.  But this book, \\"The Yasukuni Swords: Rare Weapons of Japan 1933-1945\\" is not about ignominious history or garbage blades.  It is about the preservation of an ancient art, rescued from oblivion.  In this case, it is the end, not the means that matter.<br /><br />By the time of the inauguration of the Yasukuni Forge, in 1933, there were less than 10 swordsmiths in remaining in Japan.  The sword-banning act of the Meiji Restoration had almost caused the extinction of perhaps the most refined tradition of swordcraft the world has ever known.  Even of the 10, only one, Gassan Sadakatsu, was able to make blades of ancient quality.  The military government in power, attempting to foster their aggression with the resurrection of the samurai spirit, gathered the remaining swordsmiths at Yasukuni Shrine, and established the forge.  This is their story.<br /><br />Their story is fascinating indeed, as is the tale of the slow and painful resurrection of the swordsmithing art.  Not only the smiths themselves, but all the accompanying crafts needed revival.  The unique ore needed was in short supply, and the oral tradition of its processing was in the minds of 80-year old men.  The blade polishers and the hilt wrappers all needed to be sought out and new craftsmen trained.  Specific to the Yasukuni Forge, only traditional hand-craft was used, forging blades for officers and high-ranking Imperials, rather than the machine-forged blades of the common soldier during the war.<br /><br />In the end, up to 200 new swordsmiths were raised from the fires of the Yasukuni Forge, ensuring the survival of Japanese swordcraft for future generations.<br /><br />In addition to this fascinating history,  \\"The Yasukuni Swords: Rare Weapons of Japan 1933-1945\\"  catalogs the blades of that era, showing the distinct markings and techniques and rediscovery of the art.  There are articles on the Yasukuni Forge from the 1940s, as well as modern essays on the blades.  Photographs bring the whole history to life, and this is one of the most fascinating books I have read for some time.he hilt wrappers all needed to be sought out and new craftsmen trained.

He claims that the ninja opposed bloodshed of any kind, and \\"would avoid unnecessary conflict, and even if armed with a blade, would find a way to win without staining it.\\"<br /><br />This spiritualist portrayal of ninja is distinctly at odds with historically focused books such as Stephen R. Turnbull's \\"Ninja: The True Story of Japan's Secret Warrior Cult,\\" which show the ninja as remote clans who specialized in spy work, assassination, infiltration and castle-breaking.  Hatsumi's ninjas are surely not the same as Turnbull's, who's favored technique was to sneak into a castle, set the storehouses on fire, and send the castle dwellers fleeing into the waiting swords of the Samurai army.<br /><br />Ah, but this is Hatsumi's book, and he obviously has enough clout to say what he likes.  He is the Grandmaster of the last remaining ninja school, with accolades enough from every possible martial arts society as well as the FBI.  Also, as he puts forth plainly in \\"The Way of the Ninja,\\" one should not apply scientific thought to ninjas.  They should be felt and experienced, not researched and reasoned about.<br /><br />Although the book is subtitled \\"Secret Techniques,\\" it is much more about Hatsumi's philosophy than active martial arts.  The text is overflowing with his personal musings on things as varied as diet, art, the role of martial arts, personal pride and boasting, wealth, how to properly tie a ninja mask, and pretty much every other topic.  His thoughts are free-form, drifting from topic to topic with little linear logic.  According to the translator's note, this is very typical of Hatsumi's writing, as he feels that a reader should make discoveries on his own, rather than be told directly.<br /><br />There are martial techniques in the book. Scattered about are photo-layouts showing various maneuvers.  Not being a budoka myself, I am not sure how valuable these are to learning the techniques presented.  I assume this is more of an introduction than an actual training manual, to give interested parties a feel to what they can learn from Hatsumi's tutelage.  The photos are excellent, and I wish I could see some of them in action.<br /><br />All in all, probably the most complete text available on the martial art of ninjutsu, but not something that will give insight into the historical ninja or the role they played in Japanese history.  But there are other books that provide that.  \\"The Way of the Ninja\\" has a unique insight, a personal touch lacking in historical text.

Fuji, Singing Insects, Buddhist Tombs, Reflections	\\"Exotics and Retrospectives\\" completes ICG Muse's collection of the writings of turn-of-the-century Japanologist Lafcadio Hearn.  Probably the least re-printed of Hearn's writing, it remarkably contains some of his most vital musings.<br /><br />As a collection, the books is a hodge-podge of subjects and quality. Split into two halves, \\"Exotics\\" contains his familiar subject of articles on Japan, then an undiscovered country having been open for trade to the world for only about 50 years.  Like the reporter that he is, he chronicles both the day-to-day life of the populace, as well as his own inner impressions.  The second half, \\"Retrospectives,\\" is almost all personal insight into both Japan, death and other places where his mind and body take him.  They are much more personal articles than is found in a usual Hearn collection, and say much more about the author than his adopted  country.<br /><br />Exotics:<br /><br />\\"Fuji no Yama\\" - Absolutely one of my favorite Hearn articles.  It is a true-life account of his scaling of Mt. Fuji, and the bitter struggle both personal and physical that it involves.  Having faced the challenge myself, I could relate to every heavy step, and was amazed at how little the path has changed in 100+ years.  A masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Insect Musicians\\" - An account of the \\"musical insect\\" trade that thrived in Japan at the time.  The trade has long vanished, and this is an incredible window on the past, including prices and varieties of the prized insects, and the best places to hunt them and hear them.<br /><br />\\"A Question in the Zen Texts\\" - A brief conversation about Zen, regarding a familiar story in a Chinese text.<br /><br />\\"Literature of the Dead\\" - A lengthy voyage through headstone memorials in a local Buddhist burial ground, detailing the giving of posthumous Buddhist names and how one can recognize the various Buddhist sects by the style of inscription.<br /><br />\\"Frogs\\" - A discussion of the importance of frogs in Japanese folklore and poetry.<br /><br />\\"Of Moon Desire\\" -  Thoughts on the Buddhist mind in corroboration with desire for the Universal.<br /><br />Retrospectives<br /><br />\\"First Impressions\\" - Thoughts on photography, faces and what it means to have a first impression.<br /><br />\\"Beauty is Memory\\" -  Why do we remember the beautiful more than the ugly?<br /><br />\\"Sadness in Beauty\\" - The beauty of melancholy.<br /><br />\\"Parfum de Jeunesse\\" - The sexual and luring odor of youthful beauty.<br /><br />\\"Azure Psychology\\" - Why is blue such a rare naturally occurring color? Why does the color make  us feel so strongly?<br /><br />\\"A Serenade\\" - An awakening by a sudden melody in the night brings emotion.<br /><br />\\"A Red Sunset\\" - Reflections on an impressive sunset.<br /><br />\\"Frisson\\" - The joy of human touch.<br /><br />\\"Vespertina Cognito\\" - Fear of the supernatural.<br /><br />\\"The Eternal Haunter\\" - Musings on a painting.frogs in Japanese folklore and poetry. <br /> <br />\\"Of Moon Desire\\" -  Thoughts on the Buddhist mind in corroboration with desire for the Universal. <br /> <br />Retrospectives <br /> <br />\\"First Impressions\\" - Thoughts on photography, faces and what it means to have a first impression. <br /> <br />\\"Beauty is Memory\\" -  Why do we remember the beautiful more than the ugly? <br /> <br />\\"Sadness in Beauty\\" - The beauty of melancholy. <br /> <br />\\"Parfum de Jeunesse\\" - The sexual and luring odor of youthful beauty. <br /> <br />\\"Azure Psychology\\" - Why is blue such a rare naturally occurring color?

To truly understand the country, you must understand the Japanese view on death.<br /><br />With that in mind, \\"Impurity and Death: A Japanese Perspective\\" is a key study for anyone seeking to get a grasp on Japan.  By a key book, I mean the kind that opens doors, allowing for an \\"ah-ha\\" moment on some of the more complex areas, such as Burakumin discrimination.  This discrimination was something easily described but not easily understood without the concepts of Shi-e (Death-taint) and Kegare (Pollution).<br /><br />\\"Impurity and Death: A Japanese Perspective\\"  is not really a book per se.  From the name of the publisher, Dissertations.com, I assume it is Chikara Abe's dissertation, or a paper that he wrote for study.  It reads like a dissertation, and is laid out in a fairly standard format.  With this in mind, there is no attempt to make it an interesting read, and it is pretty much a straight-forward presentation of Abe's research.<br /><br />The research focuses primarily on the shi-e class of kegare, looking at the history, interpretation over the years, and ancient and modern impact of this social construction.  His hypothesis differs from some prevailing theories, and these theories are put head to head with Abe's coming out stronger.  All of the conclusions are sound, and well-referenced.<br /><br />Definitely more scholarly than interesting on its own merits, readers on Japanese culture will find this 108 page thesis a quick but valuable read.  Prepare for a few light bulbs to go off and a few connections to be made.<br /><br />Now, if only someone could explain to me why there is a picture of the Grand Tori of Itsukushima Shrine is on the cover.  There should be a picture of a rotting corpse!	2005-03-08

And sometimes you must must set a thief to catch a thief, as the saying goes. These are the lessons of Koji Suzuki's thrilling novel \\"Ring.\\"<br /><br />A regular guy, Asakawa has everything a modern Japanese guy should want;  A nice wife and a happy son,  a decent, interesting job, and few surprises.  Life is good. Then his niece and 3 of their friends die under very peculiar circumstances, and Asakawa, a newspaper reporter, gets curious.  Following the trail leads him to a distant bungalow, an ominous room, and a cursed video tape.  Suddenly, Asakawa finds himself with a seven-day lifespan, and goes on a desperate hunt for the antidote to this infection.<br /><br />Knowing he is not up to the task, Asakawa enlists the aid of the most evil person he knows, who also happens to be his best friend.  Brilliant, strong and intelligent,  Professor of Philosophy Ryuji Takayama also happens to be a nihilist and a serial rapist, a secret shared only by Asakawa.  Together, they begin to track the mysterious video tape through the dark avenues of Japanese remote-island female Shamanistic traditions, and the secrets of the eerily beautiful Sadako Yamamura, who disappeared at age 18 almost 35 years ago.<br /><br />\\"Ring\\" is much more of a detective story than horror, as the majority of the time is spent with Asakawa and Ryuji tracking clues, deciphering the images on the tape, and uncovering the past.  Like the diggers they will eventually become, together they pull up buckets of earth, revealing new layers and getting closer to the truth with each shovelful of dirt.  At the bottom, Sadako waits for them, but whether she is a vengeful spirit or a wounded soul remains to be seen.<br /><br />The Japanese male psyche is also on harsh display, with the juxtaposition of family man Asakawa and the mystery of  Ryuji.  Rape, a much more taboo crime in Japanese society than most Western societies, is a driving force of \\"Ring,\\" with the casual attitude portrayed by Asakawa and Ryuji being as horrible as the innocent deaths.  Sadako herself, with her alluring sexuality and beauty, is siren, untouchable and lethal yet irresistible.  A man and a woman in one body, cursed with phenomenal powers, she is both victim and villain.g force of \\"Ring,\\" with the casual attitude portrayed by Asakawa and Ryuji being as horrible as the innocent deaths.

Your tour guides through this atrocity exhibition are an elite group of film scholars, professors of film studies, film historians and other academic film professionals.  This is no fan book.<br /><br />Sometimes focusing on an individual creator, such as Brazil's Jose Mojica Marins (\\"Coffin Joe\\") or Hong Kong's Anthony Wong (\\"The Untold Story,\\")  and sometimes a phenomenon, such as Singapore's Pontianak films and Italy's Zombie obsession, each entry is an incredibly well-researched and intelligent exposition of the subject matter.  Each article is footnoted and referenced, leading the way to other books and journal articles on the same subject matter.  The amount of information is truly staggering, and I would have never have guessed that there was an expert on Indonesian snake-woman films.<br /><br />While each country gets a fair showing, Japan gets a special \\"case study,\\" with three articles on different aspects of Japanese horror cinema.  There is an article/interview with Miike Takashi (\\"Ichi the Killer,\\" \\"Audition,\\") an exploration of two popular horror cycles, the \\"Ring\\" films and the \\"Eko Eko Azarak\\" series, and a look at the modern shocker \\"Suicide Circle\\" along with an interview with director Sion Sono.<br /><br />What is missing from \\"Fear Without Frontiers\\" is a cross-examination of the various world horror-cultures.  Although the Vampire film is fairly universal, there is no comparison of a  Turkish vampire film with an Italian or French vampire film.

The range of creatures, authors, films, manga, folklore and other is truly startling, covering such sub-genres as the Japanese Cthulhu mythos authors, and Chinese skeptic societies.<br /><br />None of the entries are particularly long, and there are no pictures to accompany the text.  It is very much a case of \\"wide but not deep.\\"  The book started as an encyclopedia of Japanese horror only, but the author found he could not separate the roots of Asian horror from only one culture.  Due to this,  author Laurence Bush exceeded his language abilities, and had to rely solely on the available translations of others, including unreliable resources such as internet websites and film reviews.<br /><br />However, as stated in the introduction, Bush only intends to introduce the reader to the wide and varied flavors of horror in Asian countries.  I have found my interests piqued by more than one of his shallow notations, enough to do my own research and have a wider area opened up for me.  On this level the book works very well, and is recommended.	2005-02-16

Gilmore, in \\"Monsters: Evil Beings, Mythical Beasts and All Manner of Imaginary Terrors\\" seeks to continue Campbell's thinking, this time examining the monsters which heroes are pitted against in these monomyths.<br /><br />Gilmore is no Campbell, however, and what was a life's work to Campbell is just a one-time, although enthusiastic, book for Gilmore.  He does assemble a fair argument on a universal monster; Larger than normal in size, Human eating, combining the traits of several animals into a single creature.  It is true that most monsters fit this general description, and he gives us a good picture of the fundamental fear of the human mind.  The main case studies in \\"Monster\\" are the North American Wendigo and the Spanish and French Tarasque.  These get an in-depth study, while much of the rest of the book is a tour through monsters of the world, in cultures as diverse as Japan, China and East Asia, the United States, Europe and the Hopi of North America.<br /><br />More interesting than the shared form is how this \\"Mono-monster\\" is viewed in the various cultures, sometimes feared, sometimes worshiped, sometimes accepted with neutrality.  While all cultures give breed to something similar in shape and temperament, they do not all respond to the beast in the same manner, according to Gilmore's research.  There is clearly room here for further study, and \\"Monsters\\" is ultimately wide but not deep.<br /><br />Perhaps the area covered is a bit too wide for such a slim book, as there are a few factual errors that creep in.  I recognized a few glaring errors in the chapters on Japan, which is my own particular area of expertise.  For instance, he says that the Edo period preceded the \\"modern Tokugawa period.\\"  In fact, the Tokugawa era is a medieval period, and Edo was succeeded by Meji, when Japan modernized.  While this kind of slip may have little impact on his overall ideas, it does bring into question the accuracy of his other statements.medieval period, and Edo was succeeded by Meji, when Japan modernized.

What makes the drinking of blood any more horrific than the eating of flesh (steak), or the wearing of skin (leather)?  It was a question that I had never asked before, but just accepted in such creatures as vampires and chupacabra.  Little did I know that there is an actual Biblical prohibition to drinking blood (Deuteronomy 12:23), as the soul is said to live in the blood, and to drink it is to swallow the soul and take that which belongs to God alone.  After all, \\"The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.\\"<br /><br />Such revelations can be found in abundance in \\"Religion and Its Monsters.\\"  Author Timothy K. Beal has plundered the Bible of its hidden monsters, and laid bare the secrets and contradictions of Leviathan, Behemoth and the lesser-known but more important Yam.  Although most of the mythology is Christian, he has referenced the Bagavadgita and Krishna, as well as other older religions that influenced Christianity, such as the mythology of the Near East.  As well as some insights into the nature of monsters and treated in these religions, he has shown the influence of these primitive monsters on modern life.<br /><br />He has drawn a fishhook through the mouth of the Babylonian chaos god/monster Tiamat, run a conclusive link through the Biblical Leviathan, up to Lovecraft's Cthulhu and into the enormous hides of cinematic Eco-monsters like Godzilla and his contemporaries.  He has shown the changeover in the bible, were God was set against the ancient chaos gods of older religions such as Yam and Baal, until the Revelation of John brought a new player onto the field, that of the great dragon Satan.<br /><br />An absolute must-read for anyone interested in religion and/or modern horror.  Without knowing the biblical links, such as the blood-drinking prohibition, one cannot fully appreciate monsters such as Dracula and Cthulhu.  The roots of horror run deep and olde.	2005-02-09

Each volume has Tezuka's trademark blend of serious adult issues and child-friendly storytelling.  Almost like \\"A Child's Guide to Racism, Politics, and Other Bad Things\\" each Astro Boy story contains a moral on political ambition, greed and prejudiceness.<br /><br />Volume 5 has three story arcs; \\"Crucifix Island\\" is the tale of the bitter and unfriendly Pook, a transforming robot left unfinished by his \\"father,\\" a criminal named Dr. Tozawa.  Tozawa bands together with some other criminals to storm Crucifix Island, a rich treasure depot of gems and uranium, using Pook as their main weapon.  However, his love for his \\"child\\" leads to Tozawa's undoing.  \\"Space Snow Leopard\\" is a science lesson on colony creatures, like ocean coral and sponges, as Astro Boy battles the mysterious Space Snow Leopard.  \\"The Artificial Sun\\" talks of prejudice, as robot-hater and world famous detective Sherlock Holmspun teams up with Astro Boy against gangster Kim Sankaku and a stolen artificial sun.  In order to defeat Sankaku, Astro Boy must overcome Holmspun's attitudes about robots, as well as his dark secret.<br /><br />While very cartoony in nature, and definitely aimed at a young audience, the \\"Astro Boy\\" series can be enjoyed by a wide spectrum of ages, as Tezuka's stories are universal in themes.  However, if you have a child of young reading age, Astro Boy would make a great gift.	2005-01-31

Judging from the title and size, I was expecting something along the lines of a continuation of Donald Richie's seminal \\"100 years of Japanese film,\\" something bringing equal insight into contemporary Japanese film as Richie brought into the historical.  Instead, \\"Contemporary Japanese Film\\" is nothing more than a collection of previously published and unconnected essays, interviews and film reviews by Japan-based film critic Mark Shilling.  Obviously, someone saw the potential to make money off of existing material, without further work.  There are no original articles.<br /><br />Shilling is a fine film critic and clearly knowledgeable about the modern Japanese film industry.  However, either he or his editors do not know how to assemble this knowledge into a useful book.  Several of the essays overlap, with the same information in each.  For instance, Shilling is clearly a fan of Iwai Shunji's film \\"Swallowtail,\\" as it is introduced, described and critiqued in several essays, without any acknowledgement that it was introduced only a few pages before in a different essay.  Also, several concepts, such as block-booking movies and advanced ticket sales to drive up box office, are talked about but never adequately explained for non-familiar readers.<br /><br />In addition, although it looks like a thick and potent read, more than half of the book, 250 pages out of a 388 page book, is film reviews, culled from Shilling's column in the English-language Japan times. The majority of these films are not available to Western audiences.<br /><br />All of this may sound terrible, but the content that is here is of good quality, and once one gets over the initial disappointment of the mis-labeled title, there are a few kernels of insight to pull out of the pages.  Probably the most interesting section is the directors interviews, showcasing such luminaries as Kurosawa Akira, Takahata Isao, Itami Juzo, Suo Masayuki (Shall we dance?) and Kitano Takeshi.  There are some glaring oversights, such as no Suzuki Seijun, Miike Takashi or Miyazaki Hayao, but I suppose he can't have covered everyone in his newspaper work.<br /><br />As a book about contemporary Japanese film, it is a failure.

Lovecraft Volume 4 2002 (Graphic Classics)	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Illustrating HP Lovecraft	HP Lovecraft is an author that has faced many, many terrible adaptations. His stories seem to work best the way they were originally intended, as prose stories, with his vocabulary and writing style painting a picture no visual can match. Nothing else quite captures that unique flavor.<br /><br />However, Graphics Classics, with these illustrated adaptations, seems to have scooped up generous portions of the Lovecraft feeling, enough to make \\"Graphic Classics: H. P. Lovecraft\\" one of the few gems. All of the illustrators involved have their own flair, and most work surprisingly well with the source material.  This is the updated second edition, and contains over 75 pages of new material.  They definitely kept the best stories, cut out some of the ones that didn't work so well, and have created a must-have for Lovecraft fans.<br /><br />Included are:<br /><br />A Memory - An illustrated poem, sliced from A Fungi from Yuggoth.  A beautiful introduction to what you are about to experience.<br /><br />The Shadow Over Innsmouth - One of Lovecraft's greatest yarns, a tale of buried and cursed genealogy. It is artfully adapted by Simon Crane, who captures just right that \\"Innsmouth look\\".<br /><br />Dreams in the Witch-House - Old Keziah Mason and Brown Jenkin won't let something like death and a couple of centuries stop them from completing the geometric rites demanded by Nyarlathotep.  Artist Rich Rainey adds just the right claustrophobic fear to this tense tale.<br /><br />Sweet Ermengarde - This one I had never actually heard of before! A comedy of eight acts depicting the faithlessness of a woman's heart.  No tentacles or monsters, and almost more Mark Twain than Lovecraft, but a fun read.  Adapted by Rob Lott and Kevin Atkinson, who pump on the comedy on this rare gem.<br /><br />Herbert West: Reanimator - A round-robin style piece that has several artists taking a few pages of the story. A bit disappointing, because styles are too drastically different. Would have been much better if Richard Corben had done the complete story, rather than only the first few pages, but that is just because I like him so much.  All of the artists represent well.<br /><br />The Cats of Ulthar - Exactly what it should be like. Artist Lisa Weber's unique style works perfectly with this fanciful tale of feline furry.<br /><br />The Terrible Old Man - A great bit, with perfect art. Onsmith Jeremi makes a creepy tale even creepier, with his cartoonesque depiction of those yellow eyes.<br /><br />The Shadow Out of Time - Another creative adaptation.

Most of the stories here are longer than in other offerings in the Graphic Classics series, but all are well done and respectful to the source material.<br /><br />Included are:<br /><br />The Adventure of the Copper Beeches - A fascinating Sherlock Holmes adventure well-adapted by Rick Geary.<br /><br />The Los Amigos Fiasco - An amusing tale of an Electric Chair gone wrong, with a complimenting visual style.<br /><br />The Adventures of the Speckled Band - Another fine Sherlock Holmes adaptation, with perfect artwork accompanying the original text.<br /><br />Master - A clever, short poem.<br /><br />The Lost World - Doyle's famous dinosaur tale.  Very well done, in grand adventure style.<br /><br />The Coming of the Fairies - An illustrated text version of Doyle's fairy beliefs.<br /><br />The Hound of the Baskervilles - Sherlock Holmes most famous adventure, given good treatment.<br /><br />How it Happened - A quaint ghost story.  Also well done.<br /><br />The book comes off as Sherlock Holmes heavy, which was a surprise to me, as the Graphics Classic series seems to focus on lesser-known works of authors.  I would have liked to have seen an adaptation of Doyle's mummy tale \\"Lot 249,\\" or some of his other horror work.

Hot springs, called Onsens in Japanese, are one of the greatest pleasures Japan has to offer.  Due to its volcanic nature, the entire country is literally bubbling with thermal waters, and thousands of years of careful refinement has created a paradise of hot water soaking.  Anyone coming to Japan should have a few onsens on their travel agenda, and a copy of \\"A Guide to Japanese Hot Springs\\" in their luggage.  Anyone living in Japan should definitely have a copy on their bookshelf.<br /><br />Authors Anne Hotta and Yoko Ishiguro have divided Japan into regions, then highlighted some of the best onsens in that area.  Each onsen is sub-classified by location, properties of the water (the different types of mineral waters each boast a healing power,) around and about detailing special information about the onsen and its area, close accommodations and a few extras such as local foods and legends surrounding the onsen.<br /><br />Although it was written in 1986, I have found the information to still be current, with all of the directions and accommodations still accurate.  Of course, the prices have altered since then, but that is to be expected with every guidebook.  Perhaps a good rule of thumb is to double every price in the book, for a more modern assessment.<br /><br />The only flaw in the guidebook is a lack of ranking, or recommendations.  Onsens are only classified by area, and there is no quick method for sorting which are the best.  A \\"10 Onsens worth planning your trip around\\" section, a star-system, or something of the sort, would have been appreciated.  Also, the background and history of onsens is slim, and could have been a more interesting section.<br /><br />Overall, however, \\"A Guide to Japanese Hot Springs\\" is an indispensable book, and one that has greatly added to my time in Japan.	2004-12-31

An interesting riff in the selected trio is the various flavors of dom/sub, being both sexual and completely non-sexual.  To paraphrase, sometimes a power-struggle is just a power-struggle.<br /><br />The titular story, taking up two-thirds of the book, sees a man, Shozo, who is a typical weak-willed Japanese man, pampered and childlike, bounced around as a pawn between three scheming women who checkmate each other in an attempt to win the dubious prize of Shozo's affection.  Shozo holds the ultimate trump, however, by bestowing his love only upon his cat Lily.  From there the game becomes win the cat and win the man.  Shozo is clearly a Tanizaki-character, with the main variation being his non-sexual obsession, finding love where it comes unconditionally.  But Lily has a will of her own.<br /><br />\\"The Little Kingdom\\" is a classic tale of \\"if you can't beat them, join them.\\"  A poverty-stricken teacher struggles to keep control of his life and his country classroom, in the face of a student who is a clear leader.  Recruit the leader and win the class is his plan.  A short, and semi-predictable tale, but written with enough variations that surprises can still hide around the corner.<br /><br />Finally, \\"Professor Rado\\" brings in the perverse nature that is Tanizaki's hallmark.  Professor Rado frustrates a curious journalist, who decides to look deeper than what the professor offers in an interview.  Tanizaki manages to incorporate life into this little character sketch, showing that even perversities can have perversities.<br /><br />All three stories are clever, with a wry sense of humor.  Cat lovers will understand Shozo with no difficulties, and teachers will understand why sometimes it is easier to give into the Little Kingdom.  As for Professor Rado, well...someone out there will empathize with him!  A short but fun read.athize with him!  A short but fun read.	2004-12-30

Authors, both Japanese and other, were quick to satisfy this new hunger for insight with a variety of metaphors on Japanese society.  In his book \\"Bushido,\\" Tsunetomo Yamamoto exposed Western audiences to the \\"soul of Japan\\" as a warrior's code.  Kazuko Okakura found a much more gentle metaphor in chanoyu, the Japanese tea ceremony.<br /><br />\\"The Book of Tea\\" does not propose to be a manual on the tea ceremony, but rather a launching point for Japanese aesthetics and values of beauty.  Okakura himself is not a tea master, but is a highly-educated aristocrat, schooled in classical Chinese studies and Japanese art.  He sees in chanoyu the unique elements of the Japanese eye, and juxtaposes the appeal of architecture, interior decoration, approach to art and other points with the Western view.<br /><br />The writing style reflects the tone of literature of the early 1900's, with an authoritative tone and elf-important turns of phrase.  Like \\"Bushido,\\" \\"The Book of Tea\\" seeks to showcase the idealized Japan, that dream of an aesthetic that never-was but is always sought after.  An average Japanese home has no relation to the sacred space of the tea house, and your average Japanese cup of tea is knocked back with little ceremony.  But within that, there is the search for art in life, and that can be found in chanoyu.<br /><br />Not that it is all esoteric.  There is an interesting tour through the history of tea, and its transportation from China to the world.  But \\"The Book of Tea\\" is very small, and one can not expect too much from a volume of this size.  Okakura's mussings are a quick and interesting read, and might be considered a launching point for a deeper investigation of the mysteries of Japanese aesthetics and tea.	2004-12-30

History loves a winner, and Yoshinobu only marks the end of the 300-year rein of the Tokugawa Shogunate, founded by the heroic figure Tokugawa Ieyasu. Overseeing the political and military defeat of the bakufu military government of which he was the head, Yoshinobu saw the works of his lineage swept under by the restored Meiji Emperor and his supporters.  Not exactly the hallmarks of a powerful player in history, or someone worthy of study.<br /><br />However, in \\"The Last Shogun: The Life of Tokugawa Yoshinobu,\\" author Ryotaro Shiba would have us believe that the Shogunate was book-ended by its most powerful, most impressive leaders, with Ieyasu opening and Yoshinobu closing this chapter of Japanese history.  Born Hitotsubashi Keiki, Yoshinobu was destined for greatness.  All those around him, his father, advisors, warriors and wisemen, declared him Ieyasu reborn, placing their hopes on him to restore and revitalize the bakufu military government headed by the Shogun. A strict training regime saw to his refinement, and true to the promise of his youth, Yoshinobu excelled in military arts and had the aristocratic bearing of a true ruler.<br /><br />Stacked against the nobel character and talents of Yoshinobu were two fatal flaws.  The first of which was the politics of the time, with the ships of foreign powers threatening to blow open the ports of Japan, the machinations of those lords seeking to steal power from the Tokugawa, as well as the Japanese people themselves, seeking refuge in the divine blood of the royal family, crying \\"Revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians.,\\" and moving strongly for a restoration of direct imperial rule.  Added to this was Yoshinobu's own apathy.  For all his abilities and bearings, he lacked ambition.  He was content to be a minor player, and sought to defuse struggles where possible, never taking bold ventures or risks.  An aristocrat born to power, he lacked the drive of a commoner such as Ieyasu who clawed his way into power.<br /><br />In this dynamic juxtaposition, the tide of history set against a powerful man lacking the spirit of conquest, author Shiba unfolds a fascinating story using a semi-novelesque approach that leaves us privy to the private thoughts of the cast while still remaining strictly historical in nature.  Juliet Carpenter's impressive translation retains the vitality and flow of Shiba's original. Although the ending of the book is made clear in the title, \\"The Last Shogun\\" is a fascinating journey through the end of one era and to opening of another.commoner such as Ieyasu who clawed his way into power. <br /> <br />In this dynamic juxtaposition, the tide of history set against a powerful man lacking the spirit of conquest, author Shiba unfolds a fascinating story using a semi-novelesque approach that leaves us privy to the private thoughts of the cast while still remaining strictly historical in nature.

Like a comic pulp-anthology from the 50's, maybe \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" or \\"Vault of Horrors,\\" the tension relies on less of a twist ending than a sense of rising horror as things come bubbling to the surface in a sequence or unrelated tales.<br /><br />The initial story, \\"Dark Water,\\" involves a murdered child speaking with a ghostly voice, imprisoned in a water tank on the roof of a building.  She seeks to make her voice known, through possession and rage.  This is followed by \\"Island Cruise,\\" with another dead child facing off against the innocent power of positive thinking.  \\"Adrift\\" is strictly comic-relief, with bikini-clad sailors pulling up something terrible on their fishhooks.  The final entry, \\"Forest Beneath the Waves,\\" is the least horrific but the most emotional at the same time.<br /><br />While interesting, unfortunately the stories are not well adapted.  Meimu's style does not lend itself to the subject matter, and the stories do not come off as scary.  Possibly it comes from attempting to fit too much into too small a volume, or possibly it is something in her art style, but the horror in the tales is lost.  There is enough of a kernel here to make me want to seek out the original collection, but this manga just doesn't do it for me.	2004-12-30

The stage is set with Sasuke slain, Kakashi literally mystified and Sakura learning her own limitations.  As everyone knows, when things look darkest for a band of heroes...it is time for a little payback.<br /><br />Payback is what you get in vol. 4, but not exactly in the way expected.  Naruto, full of rage over his friends death, unleashes the power of the Nine-tailed Fox demon.  Kakashi shows that he is more than the Sharingan Eye, using an innovative attack to overcome the loss of vision.  Sasuke lies on the ground dead, and there is lots of weeping.<br /><br />The real story, however, is the love and loyalty between Zabuza and Haku.  Compared to this, the trials of the four heroes are trivial.  Haku sees himself as a weapon to be wielded by Zabuza, and the true test of his loyalty comes when Zabuza's feelings are made clear.  Its some powerful, emotional stuff.<br /><br />Along with the conclusion of this story arc, vol. 4 also sets up the next adventure for the Naruto gang.  This time, they head home to face the challenge of the examinations for chunin, the next level of Ninja. Several groups of older kids come into town to face the examinations, and run foul with Naruto and friends.  Cue the music and start the fights!	2004-12-17

A Japanese garden would not seem complete without a few of those large, gold beauties swimming elegantly under a moon-curved bridge.  Some might be reminded of the Betta, often called a Japanese Fighting Fish (Or a Chinese Fighting Fish, or a Siamese Fighting Fish, or any-other-Asian-country Fighting Fish...) Rarely would one think of a goldfish.<br /><br />Goldfish (Kingyo, in Japanese) are as much of an element of Japanese art as koi, cranes, cherry blossoms and white-faced courtesans.  Like these, they are appreciated both for their natural beauty as well as their representational picturation.  \\"Kingyo: The Artistry of Japanese Goldfish\\" explores both of these sides, showcasing the many wonders of the long tradition of goldfish breeding as well as the influence of goldfish design in all aspects of Japanese art, be they ceramics, Ukiyo-e prints, kimonos, children's toys or sword guards.<br /><br />The photographs of the fish themselves are simply gorgeous.  Set against a stark white background, all of the varieties of these highly-cultured living art-objects can be admired, from the calico ryukins to the bizarre suihogan with their giant bubble-like cheek pockets.  Some breeds are more easily-appreciated than others, but all of these magnificent photographs show what they have to offer to full advantage.  Rather than encumber these images with text, the information of the many breeds is bundled together near the rear of the book.<br /><br />Along with the actual fish, there is a gallery of pretty much every conceivable type of Japanese art, emblazoned with goldfish.  Fine ceramic dishes with subtle patterns, bright and inviting kimonos making the most of the golden color, carrying cases for tobacco and medicine, metal work such as sword guards and silver hairpins; there is clearly not an aspect of art that has remained untouched by these little swimmers.  My personal favorites is the collection of Ukiyo-e prints, showing the people of Japan, high and low, enjoying the artistry of Japanese goldfish, from children scooping at them during fairs (an activity still popular in Japan today) to the moneyed classes displaying their latest acquisitions and exotic breeds.<br /><br />In addition to this, there is a 63-page novella, \\"A Riot of Goldfish,\\" translated from Japanese and showing the goldfish's influence and writing as well.  The story is a fascinating tale of obsession, both in love and in attempting to breed the perfect goldfish.  Matachi, the young goldfish breeder is swallowed whole by his art, as he attempts to express his love for the unattainable Masako, using living creatures as his medium.  It is an unexpected and welcome addition to what is otherwise a picture book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"Kingyo: The Artistry of Japanese Goldfish,\\"  much more so than I thought I would before I first picked it up.

It is very much a \\"this worldly\\" religion, trading worship of the kami in return for blessings on crops and weather.  The traditions of worship, the calls to the kami for their blessing, have been handed down through the centuries and remain some of the little Japanese writing unaltered by outside influence.<br /><br />In \\"Norito,\\" Donald L. Philippi has gathered together these calls to the kami, these prayers, from many ancient sources such as the \\"Engi-shiki\\" (\\"Procedures of the Engi Era,\\") the \\"Nihongi,\\" the \\"Kojiki,\\" the \\"Hitachi Fudoki\\" and the twelfth-century diary of a Fujiwara nobleman.  He has brought them all together into this single book, and undertook modern translations, attempting as much as possible to retain the intended flavor of the original, without allowing the Western way of thinking about religion to influence the translations.  The norito are heavily footnoted, introducing the formal thinking of the Emperor and the royal family, and the role of the kami deities.  Reading these original prayers helps frame an understanding of Shinto, and the culture that spawned it.<br /><br />In addition to this valuable collection of norito, Joseph Kitagawa provides us with a lengthy opening preface discussing the norito and \\"The \\"Strangeness\\" of non-Western Traditions.\\"  This article, with insights into the norito, their origin and evolution, is as interesting as the prayers themselves.<br /><br />My only complaint of \\"Norito\\" is that I wish it were a bilingual edition, with the original Japanese norito included along with the translation.  The ability to compare the original along with Philippi's interpretation would make a great book even better.	2004-12-10

The originals are quite hard to find, and having them collected is a treat.  Elric, a dark creature of magic and Conan, a straightforward earthbound barbarian, make strange bedfellows, but the story is one of the best, bringing back Zukala and his daughter from issue #5, although they are now much changed as Thomas and Windsor-Smith have matured far beyond the early Kirby-influenced style of storytelling.<br /><br />When Gil Kane takes over the artwork with issue #17, it is a jarring change from Windsor-Smith's delicate pencils.  While an excellent artist, his work is more suited to the superhero genre than Conan. Adapting a Turlogh Dubh O'Brien yarn, \\"The Gods of Bal-Soggoth,\\" into a Conan story works very well, and the Irishman easily becomes a Cimmerian.  The giant Vanir Fafnir, who is an occasional player in the Conan series across the years, makes his first appearance here, and the two tackle an ancient city ruled by falsehoods and old gods.<br /><br />Windsor-Smith reappears in issue #20, taking Conan and Fafnir into a Hyrkanian war, where Conan shows that he is much more than brute strength and sword-skill.  His intellect is allowed to come out to play, as he navigates a castle raid.<br /><br />All three story arcs are top-notch comic book storytelling, with the writer and artist working together in seamless harmony.  They really have the \\"feel\\" of Robert E. Howard's Conan, more so than any other adaptation or pastiche.  Any fans of Conan or just good comics should have this volume in their collection.	2004-12-09

Howard (Call of Cthulhu Fiction)	Books	4	16	21	N	Y	Skull Face and Others	Horror was clearly not a strong point with Robert E. Howard.  Proper horror requires a certain frailty of hero, someone who is confronted with something far beyond their powers, beyond their ability to come to terms with.  Howard's heroes, however, are all rough-and-tumble fighters, quick to swing and axe or fire a pistol, and never giving into such weak emotions as fear or terror.  Not exactly a viable protagonist for a horror story.<br /><br />However, in \\"Nameless Cults,\\" Howard showed himself a capable blender of Lovecraft's otherworldly Mythos and his own brand of barbarian triumph.  Much of the mythos connections are quite dubious, being only a word or two. A man shouting \\"yog sothoth\\" as he dies is enough to add it to the collection.<br /><br />Stories such as \\"Worms of the Earth,\\" with Howard's Pictish king Bran Mak Morn,  \\"The Shadow Kingdom\\" with Kull,  and \\"The Gods of Bal-Soggoth\\" featuring the Irish adventurer Turlogh Dubh O'Brien, showcase the best of Howard's style, pitting his rugged sluggers against achievable and defeatable cosmic horrors.  These stories work very well, and they are clearly Howard stories, not an attempt to mimic a Lovecraft story.<br /><br />Other stories, such as \\"Dig Me No Grave,\\" \\"The Black Bear Bites\\" and \\"The Fire of Asshurbanipal,\\" are rousing adventure stories with a supernatural flair, in tune with an Indian Jones movie.  This is true pulp fiction.  The bayou-set \\"Skull Face,\\" is on of the best Howard stories I have read, and it is a shame that it gets bogged down in it's own racism, detailing the attempt of a black men to join together and overthrow white men in a global insurrection.<br /><br />Less successful are Howard's attempts at Lovecraftian-style fiction.  He doesn't have what it takes to  tell a viable story of book-learned fellows sitting around the fire.  Stories like \\"The Thing on the Roof\\" and \\"The Hoofed Thing\\" are less successful, mediocre works at best.<br /><br />Worth noting, the cover is terrible, and I am not sure why they picked this image.  It has nothing to do with the contents, not even in tone.  I put off buying \\"Nameless Cults\\" for sometime, based on this silly screaming mouth.  I am glad to know that it is the cover that is bad, not the book.<br /><br />While not on par with his Conan stories, where Howard was an inspired writer, \\"Nameless Cults\\" is still an excellent book with enough good stories in it to outweigh the bad.  While the Bran Mak Morn and Kull stories are available elsewhere, the book is worth getting for \\"Skull Face\\" alone, if you can stomach the racism.terrible, and I am not sure why they picked this image.

Of course, I am familiar with his persona, and the idea of the \\"Hemingway man,\\" and was well aware as his stature as one of the greatest writers of modern times.  But I had never read his books.<br /><br />Wow.  I mean, really.  Wow.  With \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" it is so easy to see why Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize, and why he deserves all of his accolades.  This short novel is fierce, full of vibrant energy and humanity, all the while being a slave to the realities of finite power, of the inability to struggle against something greater than yourself.  Of course, this is the standard \\"man against nature\\" story, but it is told with such craft that even cliches ring true.<br /><br />Santiago is a fully-realized character.  His strength of will is all that holds together his failing body.  The great marlin that he struggles with is like a true fish, lacking personality or anthropomorphism, but just a powerful beast that does not want to die.  There is no Moby Dick animosity, and the fish is under the water for the majority of the struggle.  All of it, the sharks, the flying fish, the small boat and the ocean, each is what it is, lacking metaphor and saying that life itself is enough.  No need to wax poetic.<br /><br />I never knew a story a little over 120 pages could pack such a punch.	2004-12-06

Let's fight.	\\"Naruto Vol. 3\\" continues the storyline from Vol. 2, with Naruto, Sakura,  Sasuke and their teacher Kakashi defending the bridge-builder Tazuna from the assassination attempts of ninja-killer The Demon Zabuza and his companion, the beautiful but deadly Haku.<br /><br />After their brutal battle in Vol. 2, Kakashi sets the trio a stern task designed to strengthen their chakras and develop their ninja powers.  Naruto, the weakest of the three, shows his strength of will as he struggles day and night to best Sasuke's accomplishments.  This single-minded focus develop's Naruto's character as much as his chakras, as he slowly hardens and changes from the selfish blowhard of the first volumes.  Along with this, he develops a relationship with a small boy from town, Inari, who learns what it means to be a hero.<br /><br />While this self-development is all good and well, the real story begins when Zabuza and Haku attack again, facing off against the stronger, re-grouped trio.  However, the demon and his companion have been training as well, and Zabuza has learned the secret of Kakashi's \\"Sharingan Eye,\\" and how to defeat it.  Haku has secrets of his own, and Naruto and Sasuke are powerless against him.<br /><br />Vol. 3 is a change in tone for the series, a maturing if you will, as the young ninjas come face to face with their own mortality, and that the life of a ninja goes hand in hand with death.  Even with the death of their own companions, as they are forced to discover.	2004-12-06

There is some more background on \\"Red-Haired\\" Shanks, Monkey D. Luffy's pirate mentor and hero, as well as the induction of Nami the Thief into the crew.  There is a brief single story, featuring a man trapped on an island of treasure chests, before heading into the next story arc of Ussop the Liar.  Ussop is a great character, the son of a pirate who served under \\"Red-Haired\\" Shanks, and fancies himself a challenger to Luffy's captainship.<br /><br />It is a bit unsatisfying, as you have both the end of one story arc and the beginning of another in volume 3, but the story lines were not designed for this format, and do not easily fit into it, so some spillage is expected.  That aside, if you are buying volume 3 then you will be buying volume 4 anyways, right?	2004-12-03

She has a flair for making some of the more arcane aspects of conversational Japanese accessible and possibly even sensible.<br /><br />From these columns the best 20 of her articles have been culled and collected into \\"Breakthrough Japanese: 20 mini lessons for better conversation.\\"  Inside are such perennial stumpers as the difference between \\"wakarimasen\\" and \\"shirimasen,\\" the subtleties of \\"hai\\" beyond translating it as \\"yes,\\" that elusive particle \\"ga\\" as well as a host of little hints to smooth daily life. There is a definite conversation approach, as opposed to a grammar approach, and much of this is \\"non-classroom\\" Japanese, such as advice on when to drop particles and such.<br /><br />The format of the lessons is interesting, including puzzles, pictures and witticisms.  The author has injected her own personality into the language learning, as the best teachers will do.  All of the lessons are supported by quizzes and plenty of practical work.  Each lesson can be done on the fly, and the book is a great supplemental lunch time study aid.  Of course, all of the Japanese is in kana as well as romaji.<br /><br />The level is suitable for advanced beginners to low-advanced level students of Japanese.  A fresh beginner should probably get the hang of kana and basic sentence structure before diving into \\"Breakthrough Japanese,\\" but they will soon be a level to appreciate and make use of Hirayama-sensei's style.  Now if only her school, Japanese Lunch, was in my town!  I would sign up for a course right away!  I hope that this is the beginning of a series, and that more \\"Pera-Pera Penguin\\" articles will be collected for future volumes.	2004-12-01

A few rengas are included early on, to demonstrate the origins of the poetic form.  There is little critical analysis or information on the haiku format, apart from a simple 3-page introduction that offers a bare-bones explanation and some footnotes regarding untranslatable words and author's histories. (ie: Who is a student of who, etc...)<br /><br />An additional bonus of this book is that, not only can you see the evolution of the haiku, but you can also see styles and trends in English translation of haiku, as the anthology provides the work of 45 different translators, including dignitaries such as Allan Ginsberg, Alex Kerr and Lafcadio Hearn.  Several of the most important poems are given multiple English translations, so you can see how the interpretation of the translator affects the final product.<br /><br />A weakness is that many of these translations, especially the early ones, are of dubious quality, with author's attempting to define the meaning of the poem for English-speakers, and eliminating essential functions of haiku such as the non-sequitur \\"twist\\" ending that juxtaposes the imagery, or sets it's final scenery.  Often, the important final line is first in the English translation, removing some of the power. Of course, the Japanese original is always given as well, so you are welcome to make your own judgment<br /><br />Weaknesses aside, at the price of a Dover Thrift Edition, there is no reason for someone interested in haiku not to have this book in their collection.	2004-11-30

Bodies are dumped in lakes, along with stolen cars and used weapons of violence.  In \\"The Lake,\\" Kawabata has used this metaphor for his protagonist, the unsettled and possibly psychotic Gimpei Momoi, who's mind swirls past and present and make-believe into one massive body of water, under which the corpse of his father lies sleeping.<br /><br />It is hard to spend 160-odd pages in the mind of Gimpei, stalker and luster of young girls.  His story fluxuates constantly, changing in an instant from his childhood desire for his cousin Yayoi, to his disastrous affair with his High School student Hisako, to his pursuit of the pure 15-year old Machie, or the bath house girl with the voice of an angel.  Interspersed roughly with this mix is the tale of Miyako, a sad beauty who sold her youth to an old man for money.  Gimpei's thoughts are those of his nature, a dark and lonely pursuer navigating the unlit corners and ditches of other's worlds, a dangerous and haggard animal prowling the fence.<br /><br />Kawabata's technique used in \\"The Lake\\" is quite experimental, and different from his more-famous works.  Aside from the dark story, elements of which can be found in most Kawabata, the shifting narrative and abrupt transitions and endings can be off-putting to those expecting a more naturally flowing story.  Personally, I found the jump-cuts and unresolved nature of the writing to be complementary to the tale of Gimpei, with the overall effect leaving me uncomfortable and uneasy with the world, which is the stories goal.	2004-11-15

The motion picture camera in the West was seen as an extension of photography, and thus naturalism was the implied goal.  In Japan, the camera was thought of as an extension of theater. The first films were recorded versions of Kabuki plays, with men playing all the roles including the women, a tradition that carried on for a surprisingly long time in Japanese films.  In this style, representationalism is considered more important than any attempt at \\"realism.\\"<br /><br />These roots can still be seen today, as many Western viewers are confused at the artificial nature of Japanese acting and film making.  Richie explores this, as well as other uniquely Japanese film innovations such as the benshi, or silent film narrator, and how this affects modern films with their propensity for voice-over narrations explaining the plot.<br /><br />But this is only the beginning.  Richie takes us on a journey through the Japanese film, intermixed with the vast social upheavals of the Taisho period, the rise and fall of the WWII fervor, the post-war depression of spirit, and the constant battle between Western and Japanese influences on modern cinema, as well as the strange marriage between the two seen in film makers such as Kurosawa Akira, Kitano Takeshi and Miike Takeshi.<br /><br />While there is an overview of almost every Japanese director, more time is spent exploring the visions of Mizoguchi Ken, Ozu Yasujiro, Kurosawa Akira, Itami Juzo (\\"Tampopo\\"), Oshima Nagisa (\\"In the Realm of the Senses\\") as well as other directors of note.  Although there are not enough pages for a deep exploration, Richie shows how each of these milestone directors changed Japanese film in their own ways, and why they are important overall.<br /><br />The single flaw in \\"A Hundred Years of Japanese Film\\" is that Richie seems to have a blind spot for Japanese animated films, and such powerhouse directors such as Miyazaki Hayao do not get the attention they deserve, but are instead lumped into a final chapter on animation.  It seems that such directors should be considered in the overall chronology, rather than as a separate category, but this is not how they are portrayed.<br /><br />But this is a minor complaint in what is an amazing book.  For a text of this type, it is very easy to read and captivating.  Richie's writing style keeps your interest over some of the most minor periods of film, and sparks your interest in some directors that you may never have heard of.  In fact, the danger of \\"A Hundred Years of Japanese Film\\" lies in that soon you will find yourself on a desperate quest to hunt down and view some of the rare and tantalizing films described by Richie that fall out of the what may be at the local video store.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Japanese films for many years, but until reading \\"A Hundred Years of Japanese Film\\" I cannot be said to have been an educated fan.

The book is sectioned off into months, with each month telling the story of something that happens in Japan during that month in a two-page spread, with very pretty illustrations.<br /><br />This is a great book to introduce a typical Japanese lifestyle to the wee ones.  I am happy to see how authentic it is, without antiquated notions of Japanese people running around in Kimono all the time or eating sushi at every meal.  I loved seeing Mimiko listing \\"hamburger\\" as one of her top ten favorite meals.  There is not a thing in here that I have not done myself in Japan, and Mimiko acts like all the little Japanese children that I know so well.<br /><br />The illustrations are great, and offer a simple but accurate and inviting picture of things like a japanese house, a japanese summer festival, japanese food and even a japanese-style bathtub where you wash outside before getting into the water.  Throughout the book, the Japanese names for several things are given, rather than devising English translations, and a few simple characters are introduced.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone wanting to get kids interested in life in Japan, or just to open a window to another world, different yet similar.	2004-11-09

It quickly became apparent that I would need a copy for my own house,  as the origami Santa, Sleigh and Reindeer where just too much fun to pass up!<br /><br /> \\"Quick and Easy\\" is what it says on the front cover, and I believe it.  This set contains 23 origami designs with a holiday theme, as well as a decent load of origami paper to play with.  The instruction book is a small, spiral bound volume that is sturdy and easy to spread out while making the creations.  The instructions are visual and well laid-out, and there is enough origami paper included for a learning curve's worth of failures.  Everything you need is here to spread some origami Christmas cheer.<br /><br />While some of the design's festive themes are stretching it a bit, (I'm not sure a Heart and a Pinwheel can really be called \\"Christmas\\") the are more than enough outstanding designs to please.  The aforementioned Santa set with Sleigh and Reindeer is really cool, as are the Christmas Tree, Candy Cane, Holly, Angel and Stocking.  I wish the Snowman was a little better, but you can't have everything.<br /><br />I am still giving a copy of this to my nieces and nephews, as I am not that much of a Scrooge!  This would make a great gift for kids and their parents to do together.  I could also see someone giving away some of the more complicated creations as presents as well.

Each of the four stories is entertaining, and surprisingly deep considering the simple style of art.<br /><br />In the first story, Astro Boy seeks the mysteries of Robot Land, a fantasy robot theme park where robots act as characters from history and adventure.  If it sounds familiar, Tezuka's story came out 10 years before Yul Brynner's similarly themed film \\"Westworld.\\"  However, the robots do not turn bad, but are rather being kept as slaves by the greedy Dr. Haido, who uses Robotland as a cover for his illegal gun smuggling operation.<br /><br />The next tale, \\"Ivan the Fool,\\" sees Astro Boy and some others on a trip to the moon. When they discover a valley of diamonds, and an ancient Soviet robot Ivan, the greed of one man and the incapability of someone who follows orders threatens to destroy the whole group.<br /><br />The short story \\"A Day to Remember,\\" a special day in future Japan where robot versions of dead family members come back to visit for a single day, in the tradition of the Japanese Obon festival. A time machine and a dead little boy who looks just like Astro Boy lead on to adventure.<br /><br />Finally, in \\"Ghost Manufacturing Machine\\" a Hitler-like villain uses a machine to create an eternal ghost of himself that can live forever and inflict his evil on the world.  Astro Boy and local hero-robot Platinum must fight against this unstoppable foe.<br /><br />As with all the volumes in the Dark Horse Astro Boy series, the individual stories are not collected in any particular order, but do contain a brief introduction from Tezuka himself explaining his story, and what he thinks of it.	2004-11-08

Akamatsu Ken has found a unique voice for the series, with a darker-edged story, and more attention and affection for the characters with every page.  This is definitely my favorite volume so far.<br /><br />The main story of volume 3 is the appearance of a challenging villain for Negi Springfield.  One of his own students, Evangeline, is revealed to be a vampire who stalks the students of the Mahora school.  There first encounter leaves Negi soundly defeated, in large part to Evangeline's robot slave (and also Negi's student!,) Cha-cha Maru.  In order for Negi to fully realize his powers, and defeat Evangeline and Cha-cha Maru, he must find a partner to magically link with and boost their powers.  An old friend of Negi's, Kamo-kun, shows up to help him along.  Because this is an Akamatsu comic, to achieve the magical link Negi needs to kiss his new partner, and all the girls of the Mahora school are ready and willing.<br /><br />Who will become Negi's partner?  The obvious choice to Kamo-kun is Negi's crush, the cute but timid Miyazaki Nodoka.

There is a good  variety of dishes, and very simple instructions for cooking.<br /><br />This one focuses on five fundamental styles of Japanese cooking, basically what a Japanese family would eat at home on a day-to-day basis.  Shabu-shabu are generally meat dishes cooked in a metal hot pot, Sukiyaki is both meat and seafood cooked in either a metal or a ceramic nabe pot.  Tempura is battered and fried...well anything, really. Teppan-yaki is thin slices of meat and vegetables cooked on a metal hot plate.  Teriyaki is a slow style of cooking fish and meats that produces a distinctive taste.<br /><br />Shabu-shabu, Sukiyaki and Teppan-yaki are all very social means of cooking, where everyone sits around a bubbling pot or hot plate and cooks their own meal at a table.  They are really great ways to have a dinner party, even better in the winter when you can huddle around a hot dish.<br /><br />Each style has a good sample of different ingredients using the same method.  There is typically a beef dish, a pork dish, a chicken dish and a seafood dish.  While I haven't tried everything, the Seafood sukiyaki is amazing, as is the salmon teriyaki.<br /><br />\\"Favorite Japanese Dishes\\" is probably not a very good cookbook for vegetarians, as almost all of the dishes have meat or seafood of some sort.  The exception is tempura, which can be cooked with pretty much anything.	2004-11-06

Each sub-category has several vocabulary words and phrases, as well as common usage for each entry.  Like any Japanese study book worth getting, both romaji and kana are used for each entry.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a guide to picking up Japanese guys/girls might be disappointed with \\"Love, Hate and Everything In-between.\\"  This is a serious study aid for those looking to expand their fluency in Japanese, focusing on a specific, useful and fun aspect of the language.  I have found it particularly of aid in reading Japanese manga, where relationships, both love and hate, form a major part of most storylines.<br /><br />The only drawback to this book is that it is pretty much a straight dictionary, without any exercises such as are found in the \\"Handbook of Japanese Verbs.\\"  It probably isn't something that you will read straight through, but rather pick an emotion and expand your ability to express emotions in Japanese.	2004-11-06

The book has recipes for Appetizers, Soups, Just Tofu, Seafood, Poultry, Meats, Vegetables, Salads, Eggs and Cheese, Rice and Noodles and even Desserts. (You know you want to make a tofu cheese cake!)  The selection is varied enough that both vegetarians and meat eaters will find value.  There is also a good mix of \\"ethnic\\" (mainly Japanese) and American-style recipes, some traditional and some original creations.<br /><br />I was surprised at how authentic the ethnic recipes were, and not \\"Americanized\\"  The Japanese recipes freely use notorious ingredients like natto and konnyaku and other interesting items.  I do wish the author had used the Japanese names for the dishes, as some of the new names she gives them, such as calling Oden \\"Tofu Casserole\\" are a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />There are easy-to-follow instructions on handling and cooking the tofu, which does take some practice.  I have had a difficult time draining the tofu properly, but am getting the hang of it more and more with each attempt.  There are also some basic instructions on Japanese cooking, such as how to make your own dashi stock and other tips. There is also a glossary of ingredients in the back for some of the more unfamiliar Asian foodstuffs.<br /><br />So far, I have really enjoyed the \\"Crabmeat and Tofu Patties,\\" \\"Spicy Grilled Tofu,\\" \\"Natto-jiro,\\" \\"Tofu with Oyster Sauce,\\" \\"Homemade Tofu Burgers,\\" (Yum!) \\"Sauteed Shrimp with Hoisen Sauce\\" and oh...everything I have tried.

Provided, of course, you can actually make them.<br /><br />\\"Hana Sushi\\" is not for beginning sushi chefs. This is an intermediate/advanced book that assumes some previous familiarity with making sushi rolls. There is some guidance as to making the individual designs, but the fundamentals of rolling sushi should be mastered before you tackle these more-intricate creations. Fortunately, there are many sushi fundamental guides out there, so no one should be completely lost.<br /><br />When you feel confident, there is a roll in here for pretty much every occasion. For Christmas, there are snowmen and Christmas trees, for Easter a bunny. The majority does not fit such a festive theme, but rather individual motifs such as animals (panda, kitten, chick, butterfly, piglet, etc...) fruit (grapes, apple, cherries, etc...,) vehicles (balloons, cars, trains, etc...) and the very Japanese motif of flowers (dandelion, tulip, peach blossoms, cherry blossoms, etc...) On top of this, there are even more adventurous creations such as a sushi cake and a pair of really lovely edible dolls.<br /><br />There are enough tacklable designs in \\"Hana Sushi\\" to make it practical as well as fun to look at.  While I don't think I will be serving up anyone a \\"princess sushi cake\\" anytime soon, I will put some simple snowmen on the table at Christmas time, and probably a smoked salmon roll or two done uramaki style with the salmon on the outside.  A good cook book overall (well, not really a cook book as there isn't much cooking going on!) and one that I am glad to have in my library.	2004-10-21

This chair is given to the woman, and each time she sits in it she nestles unknowingly in his lap, puts her weight onto him, lays her head against his face.  The furniture maker silently feels her every night, without her ever knowing.  The atmosphere, the detail of the language, and the sheer nature of the story combine for one of the classics of this genre.<br /><br />\\"The Chair\\" is of course included in \\"Japanese Tales of Mystery & Imagination,\\" a compilation by the father of Japanese mystery writing.  Much is made of his adopting the Japanese pronunciation of Edgar Allan Poe as his pen name, but Rampo's style is his own.  He favors psychological horror, and there are few elements of the supernatural to be found.  Sociopaths and obsessives seem to be his stock in trade, with detailed exercises on how to commit the perfect, untraceable murder.  Many of the stories end with some unexpected revelation, although I would not call it a \\"twist ending.\\"  The obsessive nature of the stories renders them all the more disturbing, as almost every story is something that could conceivably happen.<br /><br />In addition to the excellent \\"The Chair,\\" you will find \\"The Caterpillar\\" featuring a cruel wife's abuse of her de-limbed husband, \\"The Cliff,\\" a back-and-forth story that will leave you wondering who is manipulating who, \\"The Hell of Mirrors,\\" a man obsessed with optics and reflecting surfaces descent into insanity, \\"The Red Chamber,\\" revealing the true nature of those who are attracted to stories of others deaths, \\"The Two Crippled Men,\\" a story of a murderous sleepwalker who commits crimes without ever knowing it and \\"The Traveler with the Pasted Rag Picture,\\" the only story with a supernatural twinge, showing brotherly devotion and love of the unreal.<br /><br />Each story in \\"Japanese Tales of Mystery & Imagination\\" is well-selected, and James B. Harris does a fine job with the translation, maintaining the tension and original intention.  The only real shame is that this is the only collection of Rampo's works that has been translated into English.

The ideal of maritime ghosts and haunted ships has always had an appeal as well, so I decided to check out \\"The Ghost Pirates\\" as my first voyage on Hodgson's shadow-haunted seas.<br /><br />Hodgson leaves no doubt that a sailing ship is an ideal setting for a weird tale, being entirely bound in the confines of the vessel, and literally no where to run to when things become rough.  The hardy breed of the seamen is a strong contrast to Lovecraft's academics and dilettantes, and there is a much firmer hand guiding the story.  The sailors on the packet-ship Mortzestus are brave and skilled, yet not warriors by any means, rather tradesmen cast into unknowable circumstances.  Jessop is an excellent spokesperson for the book, being a bridge between the upper-class ship's officers and the lower laborers, each with their own ideas and solutions.  Hodgson clearly knows his way around a true sailing ship, as the relationships and terminology on board have the ring of authenticity.<br /><br />Hodgson plays carefully with his cosmic horrors, lifting the veil only enough for a frightening glimpse but not enough to reveal all mysteries.  Although called \\"The Ghost Pirates,\\" these are no departed spirits of men that haunt the Mortzestus but rather something from beyond the realm of rational thought.  The inevitiablity of the situation is tense, as the sailors sense the approaching doom while being unable to fathom or prevent it.<br /><br />After \\"The Ghost Pirates,\\" I will definitely seek out more of William Hope Hodgson's books, specifically the remainder in this loose trilogy, \\"The Boats of the 'Glen Carrig' \\" and \\"The House on the Borderland.\\"	2004-10-19

(After having passed Kakashi's test to be full-fledged Ninja, of course!)  The foursome are hired to protect Tazuna, a gruff and unfriendly bridge builder from the Land of the Waves.  Tazuna is being hunted by The Demon Zabuza, a fearsome outlaw ninja who slaughtered his entire graduating class from The-Village-Hidden-in-the-Mist.<br /><br />Volume 2 expands on the themes brought up in Volume 1. Naruto is still an almost unlikable brat, but his potential comes out more and more.  Kakashi serves as a teacher both to the reader and to Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke, unfolding tales of the Chakras, the Kage ninja leaders, and other essentials of author Kishimoto's ninja fantasy world.  The secret of Kakashi's hidden eye is revealed as well in an awesome battle with The Demon Zabuza.<br /><br />Everything really starts to take off with this volume.

If they can find the magic book, and the girls can manage to not place at the bottom of all the classes, Negi can get granted full-teacher status.  It should be no problem, because leading the way are members of the Library Island Explorers club.

They wear black costumes.  They are sneaky, almost able to be invisible.  They uses an arsenal of strange and interesting weapons.  But is any of that the truth?<br /><br />While not everything I would want it to be, Steven Turnbull has done an admirable job bringing together the known historical facts and the wild fictional fantasies of the Japanese warrior known as the Ninja.  \\"Ninja: The True Story of Japan's Secret Warrior Cult\\" is very small, 150 pages, many of which are stuffed with illustrations, leaving not much room for a thorough exploration of the Ninja mysteries.  The format is almost \\"coffee table\\" style, being a larger sized format.  Although it doesn't leave as much room for text as one would wish, the book has a stunning collection of old Ninja-related Japanese artwork, from full-color reproductions of Ukiyo-e woodblock prints to small black and white pornographic scenes of ninjas produced in cheap books of the time.<br /><br />The meat of the work is found in the first eight chapters,  detailing the history of what we have come to know as Ninja, although at the time known primarily as Shinobi.  Pure history is obviously Turnbull's specialty, as he details the rise of the use of stealth skills in combat in Japan, primarily in terms of castle-breaking, where Shinobi would scale the walls of an enemy castle at night and set first to it from the inside, forcing the panicked population to retreat from the burning structure and  into the swords of the Samurai waiting outside. He shows the establishment of Ninja clans at Iga and Ueno, who would rent out their military services, a shockingly dishonorable practice at the time, and engage in activities thought unsuitable for Samurai.  This is followed by the eventual destruction of these Ninja clans by the Tokugawa armies, and the dispersion of their skills into general Japanese armies.<br /><br />The book's main weakness lies in the ability to interpret these historical facts in light of the modern view of the Ninja.  Turnbull shows the development of the stereotypical black Ninja costume in the illustrations, but doesn't comment on whether the Iga or Ueno Ninja clans ever actually employed this outfit.  There is some attempt at rationalizing the \\"Hollywood\\" version of the Ninja with the historical, but all in all the book merely skims over this fascinating area, remaining basically a Ninja-history book with a few token attempts at acknowledging the present.  I would really like to see the evolution of the Ninja from the dishonorable castle-breaker to the black-clad superhero of today.  How did it happen?  Is there any truth at all to the modern image of the Ninja?  These kinds of questions go largely unanswered.<br /><br />As a straight history book with a top-class collection of old Ninja artwork, \\"Ninja: The True Story of Japan's Secret Warrior Cult\\" succeeds.  However, when looking for some historical analysis, or unique insight on the part of the author towards the Ninja, then the book is not satisfying.

Howard was an inspired writer when working on his most famous creation, Conan of Cimmeria, he never quite managed the same magic with his other characters, a host of prize fighters, detectives, sword-swinging Irish and Scots heroes, and a horde of other hot-blooded men of adventure.  Inspired by his friend HP Lovecraft, he tried his hand at horror more than once with limited success.  \\"Black Canaan\\" collects a few of the best of these efforts, and some mediocre.<br /><br />Despite the mis-leading cover, where the word \\"Conan\\" appears just as large as the title, and a shirtless, black-haired barbarian swings a club at an approaching monster, this book contains almost no fantasy stories.  Instead, we encounter folk such as Dermod O' Conner, John Conrad and John Kirowan.  They are all cut from the same Conan mold, strong, thick-hewed men who are quick to act and bold  in intention.  The theme of buried racial memories, and an ancestral strain slowing climbing its way back to the present are frequent spring boards for stories.  Settings for adventure are places such as Zimbabwe, Arabia and any place sounding exotic to Howard's Texan ears.<br /><br />By far the two most successful stories in the collection are \\"Black Canaan\\" and \\"Moon of Zambabwe (sic),\\" both of which transport Lovecraftian tribal horror to the bayous of the South, where the African slaves brought their own dark gods with them, and unholy rituals.  By the very nature of the tales, they appear somewhat racists in modern eyes, so it is important to see them in their proper historical context.  However, both are great adventure/horror stories, and two of the best non-Conan stories Howard wrote.  If you haven't read them, it is worth getting \\"Black Canaan\\" for these two alone.<br /><br />Other successful tales include the almost Sherlock Holmesian \\"The Noseless Horror,\\" another Lovecraft inspired swamp adventure, \\"The House in the Oaks\\" featuring Howard's Mythos addition, Justin Geoffrey,  and the raw adventure \\"People of the Black Coast.\\"ffrey,  and the raw adventure \\"People of the Black Coast.\\"	2004-10-05

Howard stories, this collection contains \\"Rogues in the House, \\" and the perfect \\"The Frost Giant's Daughter.\\"  Another story, \\"Garden of Fear\\" is a Howard adaptation from a different character, but suits Conan fine.  The original stories, as well as new characters such as the faithless Jenna, add context and flow to the adaptations, seating them in a definite time-line that Howard never attended to.<br /><br />Barry Windsor Smith's art in this volume is leaps and bounds above his derivative work in Chronicles of Conan vol. 1, \\"Tower of the Elephant and Other Stories.\\"  He is closer to the style that would make him famous, and elevate him above mere comic book artist.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this trade paperback edition is not without it's flaws, mainly being the lack of original covers and some unnecessary modern coloring effects.

Books	5	5	6	N	N	Hither came Conan	It is amazing to finally have this volume released in an affordable format.  \\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\\" was originally published as a limited edition hardcover by Wandering Star press, a publishing house exclusively devoted to the works of Robert E. Howard, producing premium editions much like \\"special edition\\" DVDs.  For the first time ever, the original Howard Conan stories complete and uncut with a host of original illustrations and special features.  The only problem being that one hardback book sold for over a hundred dollars.  And now, to have all of the same material, including the original illustrations, in an inexpensive paperback format!  A dream come true!<br /><br />Robert E. Howard was a decent pulp writer,  Brusque and manly, he waxed yarns of hot-blooded heroes quick to the gun or sword, depending on their era.  When writing Conan, however, he was inspired.  These tales of high adventure are as primal as their hero, tapping into some deep, recessed part of the soul where a creature runs about in animal skins and takes what he wants, but not without honor.  Woman and treasure and danger and violence, but presented without exploitation and with a quality of writing that renders such things viable.  Writing cut from that Hemmingway fiber, if he had written about sword-swinging barbarians instead of gun-toting revolutionaries.<br /><br />\\"The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian\\" presents, in chronological order, some raw slices of Howard's vision.  \\"The Phoenix on the Sword,\\" originally intended as a Kull of Atlantis story before recasting it with his new creation, remains one of the finest stories in the genre.  The short story\\"The Frost-Giant's Daughter\\" is mythic and wonderful, pitting human strength against the Gods.  \\"The Tower of the Elephant\\" blends Howard's rawness with the cosmic insight of his friend HP Lovecraft.  Really, they are all gems.<br /><br />The \\"special features\\" are an interesting insight into Howard's mind, showing story development and process, as well as providing some background on the world of Conan.  in \\"Hyborian Genesis\\" there is the story of the creation of Conan, and his influences.

It is a very small text, being only 124 pages in length, and almost every concept is summarized and skimmed over as briefly as the stories themselves.  The fundamental concept of the book, that ghost legends such as these remain a necessary aspect of modern culture, is an interesting concept but is poorly established.  While there is mention of various Japanese texts that examine these legends from a Japanese perspective, there is little summation or translation so the ideas presented, and usually not more than an author's name and a title are given.  The book shows some contempt for Joseph Campbell's theories on Japanese culture, but does not go inot a serious debate against his ideas, more of a general dismissal.<br /><br />Even in the face of these failings on a whole, \\"Ghosts and the Japanese\\" is a good book, rich with unique ghost stories as well as wonderful reproductions of the Zenshoan Temple's massive collection of ghost portraits.

According to Kawabata, this longing increases with age, and one romances ghosts from the past, using the present to conjure up their memories from the depths of a forgetting mind.<br /><br />The leading story, \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties,\\" is among the best, most powerful Kawabata stories I have ever read.  It shows an author in full command of his style, able to arouse a startling depth of emotion using a limited palette of words and scenery.  The story is simple in conception, disturbingly erotic in nature, and stunning in execution.  An old woman runs a brothel for impotent old men, housing unnaturally sleeping virgins who have no performance expectations of the old man, nor incriminations for their inabilities.  The old men may lie with them, hold them and drink in their youth and beauty free from the hard reality of their own impotence.  The sleeping girls will never know who was with them, or what was done.  The only forbidden act is sex.<br /><br />The story is pure eros without sex, the desire of the impotent.  The leading figure in the tale, Eguchi is \\"still able to function as a man,\\" unbeknownst to the brothel keeper.  He knows what it is to desire more than the girls are willing to give, and the tension between his desires, the rules of the house, and the depressing reality of Eguchi's future impotence combine and take form under Kawabata's guiding hand.  With each girl he sleeps next to, Eguchi wanders through his memories, remembering his youth and the girls he shared it with.  Such a story can only come to one ending, and reality comes crashing into his fantasy.  A stark and gripping tale.<br /><br />The remaining stories, \\"One Arm\\" and \\"Of Birds and Beasts,\\" suffer in the aftermath of the powerful \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties.\\"  \\"One Arm\\" in particular is a disappointment, perhaps due to its too-surreal situation, and an old man who borrows a young woman's arm (given quite willingly) then proceeds to romance and fall in love with the limb.  As with \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties,\\" this is eros without sex, desire without lust, but it lacks the honesty and fantasy/reality blend that makes the former story so strong.<br /><br />\\"Of Birds and Beasts\\" is good enough, and a better story than \\"One Arm.\\"  Completely lacking in eroticism, this is another tale of an old man who seeks companionship, this time in all sorts of dogs and birds.  His house is full with his menagerie, and he and his lone maid tend to the creatures with something less than love.  Each new animal holds his attention for a few weeks at most, before it is filed away and forgotten in the background.  Like \\"House of the Sleeping Beauties,\\" each new animal summons up memories, this time of the birds that the old man kept accidentally killing, then buying a new set.  A sad and lonely story to be sure, but with the same emotional depth one expects from Kawabata.<br /><br />\\"House of the Sleeping Beauties and Other Stories\\"  is worth buying for the lead story alone, which is widely considered amongst Kawabata's finest.

Astro Boy, or course, is number seven on the list.<br /><br />Pluto has long been depicted as Astro Boy's Arch Enemy, and any action shots of Astro Boy are likely to be seen in battle with this mighty horned robot.  One by one, Pluto tackles and destroys the greatest robots from several countries, such as Mont Blanc from France, Hercules from Greece, as well as champions from Australia, Germany and Scotland.  In order to challenge Pluto, Astro Boy has his power increased to 1 million horsepower.  Will it be enough?<br /><br />As well as a good story, \\"Astro Boy (Volume 3)\\" is a glimpse into Tezuka Osamu's soul.  Unable to make Pluto completely evil, he redeems the murderous robot with a sense of honor and responsibility, as well as a desire for the friendship of Astro Boy's sister, Uran.  As with all of Tezuka's stories, there is more going on under the surface, as the struggle to build a more and more powerful robot becomes a metaphor for the nuclear arms race of the 1950s Cold War.<br /><br />Also included in this volume is a short story, \\"Mad Machine,\\" where an evil scientist creates a device that makes all machines, from clocks to Astro Boy, go berserk.  He uses the machine to extort 2 billion yen from the robots of the world.  Of course, such a scheme could never work with Astro Boy around!	2004-09-15

In \\"The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi,\\" William Scott Wilson has stripped the legends away and presents a true historical account of the wandering swordsman, artist and philosopher.  In this instance, the history is no less interesting than the fantasy.<br /><br />Wilson, who has an impressive resume when dealing with Musashi and the Samurai, having translated Samurai works such as \\"Hagakure,\\" \\"The Life-Giving Sword\\" as well as Musashi's own \\"The Book of Five Rings,\\"  presents us with a \\"Real Live Human Being.\\"  He has sifted through the various conflicting history books and biased clan records, investigated the several \\"confirmed\\" birth places and graves of Musashi, and logically assembled an accurate history of the man, his philosophy and his biography.  From his first lethal match at 13, to the famous duel at Ganryu Island that was to secure Musashi's place in history, followed by his later years refining his technique and maturing into the warrior-poet who would write \\"The Book of Five Rings,\\" secluded in an isolated cave on the grounds of a Buddhist temple, Musashi's complete life is detailed.<br /><br />More than Musashi the warrior, it is clearly the seemingly contradictory image of Musashi the philosopher and artists that interests Wilson the most.  Of Musashi's 60 duels, only the most important are given any coverage, but several of his paintings and works of art are analyzed in-depth, discussing both the skill Musashi had with an ink brush as well as the Zen Buddhist philosophies backing each piece.  Backgrounds are given on the various art styles, including an analysis of the kanji (Chinese characters) that make up each art form.  Perhaps he felt that Musashi the warrior had received enough attention from other sources, but the artists needed a bit more spotlighting.  It does make one wish for a Musashi art book, detailing his works.<br /><br />Wilson does assume some familiarity regarding Japanese history and Musashi's life on the part of the reader.  Such things as the Waring States period, familiar to anyone who knows Japanese history, are not explained but are put forward as common knowledge.  There is some interesting analysis of the kanji for the various names of the warriors, and Wilson shows how, in spite of the books title, Musashi was not an actual Samurai at all, as he never served a lord.  Musashi was a bushi, a warrior.<br /><br />In addition to the main text, Wilson includes some fascinating appendixes, juxtaposing the legend of Musashi as told in Kabuki plays, movies and Yoshikawa Eiji's famous book with the accurate history.  Also of interest is a comparison of the philosophies of \\"The Book of Five Rings\\" with similar tomes such as Sun Tzu's \\"The Art of War.\\"<br /><br />All of this is packed into a fairly slim and highly readable book.  A definite must have for anyone interested in Japan's greatest legend, Miyamoto Musashi.but the artists needed a bit more spotlighting.

I have never seen the \\"Hikaru no Go\\" anime, and don't really know anything about the series beyond this one book, but it looks to be an interesting comic.  The premise, basing an entire series around the game of Go, is different enough and captivating enough to make me want to keep reading.<br /><br />This first volume is a good introduction, demonstrating and explaining the Go game to those who are not familiar with it, as well as introducing some of Japan's Go culture, and the intensity behind the game.  Hikaru is our tour guide through this strange world, as ignorant of Go as most of the readers.  As Hikaru learns, we learn.<br /><br />Of course, there is more than just Go in the comic, with the supernatural elements brought in by the possessing spirit Fujiwara-no-Sai, doomed to haunt a Go board until he fulfills his goal of playing the \\"Divine Move.\\"  There is no love interest as yet, nor any particular crisis that happens other than the initial set-up.  I get the feeling that  \\"Hikaru no Go\\" is a patient comic, that will slowly unveil the plot over time.  I definitely plan to keep reading.	2004-09-09

Roy Thomas had not yet found the right voice for Conan, and Barry Smith was still a hack artist imitating everyone and coming off bland.  To top it all off, for the first several issues Conan wears a silly horned helmet.  BUT!<br /><br />It gets better.  With each issue, Thomas and Smith begin to gel, begin to flex their creative muscles, and begin to define a Conan that is different from Howard's, but no less true.  Conan loses the silly helmet.  And then there series gets amazing.<br /><br />Here we have the seeds of greatness, along with some really excellent stories.  \\"The Tower of the Elephant,\\" including even the prose of the original Howard story, is a great Conan adventure.  \\"Twilight of the Grim Grey God,\\" although not originally a Conan story, is well-adapted to the Northern Barbarian.  \\"Zuakal's Daughter\\" is a fine story, although the villain looks a bit too much like Dr. Doom.<br /><br />It is a shame that the original covers where not included.  Otherwise, this is a excellent collection of Conan stories.  Roy Thomas's musings on the series are very cool, like having a director's commentary track on a DVD.	2004-09-09

After all, you don't learn English by reading the Dictionary!<br /><br />As a reference book, it is excellent.  It breaks down the Japanese language into 3 basic sentence patterns (Nominal, Adjectival, and Verbal), then shows possible variations.  As it is a grammar reference, the book assumes that one is fluent in grammatical English as well, and that the readers know a participle from a predicate.  Along with the basic patterns, the book demonstrates how formality/informality and men's/women's languages can influence the shape of a Japanese sentence.  There are many example dialogs, showing the same conversation from a few viewpoints.<br /><br />As with all decent Japanese texts, it uses Japanese kana, in this case complete kanji, when writing Japanese, then provides a romaji translation.  I don't think that this is a good reference for learning new vocabulary, but a few words might be picked up here and there.<br /><br />All in all, \\"A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Sentence Patterns\\" provides a good resource for what can be a confusing element of the Japanese language.  Sometimes having something explained in a different manner can help it to click, and even when deciphering longer sentences, it is good to know that they will fit the variation of one of the three patterns.	2004-09-06

The Japanese journey takes up around 75% of the book.<br /><br />During his Japanese stay, encompassing several months, Campbell was taken around Japan by a variety of people, from American Buddhists to Japanese Professors.  He saw many of the major sights of Japanese religion, in areas such as Tokyo, Nara and Kyoto. He was shown Japanese traditional arts such as Noh and Kabuki theatre, as well as hostess bars and houses of prostitution.  Along with this are intricate discussions on Buddhism in Japan with local experts, and a mental ordering of ideas that was later to become \\"The Masks of God.\\"<br /><br />Frankly, the book is not as interesting as I was hoping.  I wanted to peek into Campbell's mind, and hear his reflections on Japanese culture and religion.  I wanted insights and personal thoughts about the temples and monuments of Japan that he was seeing, such as the Great Buddha of Nara.  Instead, more attention is paid in the journal to which restaurants he went to that day, and how he is progressing with his Japanese language studies, and what old friends he met that day and such.  He goes to restaurants and studies Japanese more than anything else, but even with these there is little insight, and mostly statements of facts.<br /><br />A standard entry is along the lines of \\"Tuesday: Had breakfast at cute old inn.  Very delicious.  Was taken to see Great Buddha at Todaiji in Nara in the afternoon.  Came back to Kyoto for dinner, a nice Indian restaurant.  In the evening, wrote letters to Jean, and studied Japanese.

There are many comparisons of Indian and other Asian cultures, reflecting how they got it \\"right\\" and Indian culture is stuck in a quagmire.  Reading the first volume of the Asian Journals will help put all of this into perspective.<br /><br />There is some good stuff here, and it is an interesting read, but it is probably more for those interested in Campbell as a person than those hoping for unique insights into Japan and Japanese culture.  In one passage, Campbell wonders if he has not perhaps wasted his trip to Japan by spending long hours studying Japanese language rather than experiencing the country.

He created the genre known as Ukiyo-zoshi, a written companion to the famous Japanese Ukiyo-e prints, showcasing the \\"floating world\\" and decadent lifestyles of the Japanese pleasure quarters of the 16th century.<br /><br />As a book, \\"The Life of an Amorous Man\\" is the story of Yonosuke (\\"man of the world\\"), an alternately wealthy and poor dilettante, who seeks the pleasures of woman and wine, living wholly for sensuality.  His story is told in a sequence of short stories, with each segment being some new romantic adventure.  Yonosuke journeys throughout Japan, experiencing the delights of the pleasure quarters of the far away places of Edo, Kyoto, Osaka and many, many small towns and islands in between.  The book offers an incredible insight into this particular vanished Japanese culture, displaying the social rules and attitudes prevalent at the time. Ihara is a writer noted for his realism, and you can be sure that this is a true portrait of the times.<br /><br />Those expecting anything \\"naughty\\" will be disappointed, as the intimacies are more implied than anything else.  All the prostitutes and pleasure seekers are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their station in life.  It is interesting to note that the translator chose the term \\"Gay Quarters\\" for the pleasure quarters of Japan.  This does not mean homosexuality, which is translated using different terms.  However, at the time in Japan sex between men was not frowned upon, and there is some in here as well.<br /><br />\\"The Life of an Amorous Man\\" is an enjoyable read, with good characters and great insights into an interesting period of Japan and Japanese culture.  One can still see the reflection of these pleasure districts in Japan today, with their social rules and delights.	2004-08-12

In 1982, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, held an exhibition of Japanese Living National Treasures and Gassan Sadaichi was invited to set up a forge and create a sword for the exhibition. This book catalogs that exhibition, as well as tells the history of the Gassan tradition.<br /><br /> &quot;Japanese Master Swordsmiths: The Gassan Tradition&quot; is typical of books that accompany museum exhibitions. It is bilingual, in both English and Japanese, and contains several fine plates of the swords and artifacts seen in the collection.<br /><br /> Of particular interest is the explanation and focus on the ayasugi-hada grain pattern that is the hallmark and secret of Gassan. The history of the Gassan school is very interesting, particularly how they survived the difficult periods of Japanese history, such as during US occupation, when swordsmithing was banned.<br /><br /> There are no color plates, which is disappointing, as having seen several Gassan blades in person, it is only in color that the ayasugi-hada grain can be truly appreciated. Other than this flaw, it is a fine book for those interested in Japanese swordsmithing.	2004-07-23

Connections and wealth buy a seat in an Ochaya, and on the streets of Gion in Kyoto catching a glimpse of a Geiko (Geisha in the Kyoto dialect) is as rare as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster.  Geiko move fast down the streets and alleyways, and a sighting is something to tell your friends about.<br />With \\"Geisha : A Life,\\" Mineko Iwasaki lifts some of the veils of this fantasy world and shows that, underneath the make-up and fancy hairstyles, Geiko are just women, with the same thoughts and feelings and pride and emotion as everyone else.  In some ways, this destroys the fantasy, being able to see \\"behind-the-scenes.\\"  The life of a Geiko is very difficult and somewhat...boring.  Like a dedicated ballet dancer, the bulk of their life is training and practice, trying to achieve a near-impossible idea of body and movement.<br />\\"Geisha: A Life\\" is not compellingly written, nor as fascinating as the sexualized and fictional account \\"Memoirs of a Geisha.\\"  It is not as academically insightful and full of details as Liza Dalby's \\"Geisha.\\"  But it is honest and real.  Mineko's account of her life is straightforward, without much decoration.  After reading it, you will know what it is like to be a Geiko.<br />Woven into this account, perhaps unintentionally, is the loss of Japan's disappearing past.  Mineko doesn't bat an eye when telling the story of how she leveled their 100-year old Geisha residence, in order to build a modern night club and hair salon because she thought it would make more money.  She talks with hope of her artist husband someday becoming one of Japan's legendary Living Treasures, but doesn't see how she should belong in the same category.  She feels loss for the fading world of the traditional Japanese arts, but keeps destroying them along with everyone else.	2004-07-15

It is an incredibly powerful and intense story, with the ability to make you feel as suffocated and trapped as Jumpei in the sand pit.  Of all the Japanese books I have read, I found &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; to be the most direct, the least subtle.  The entire story happens out in the open, naked and vulnerable, raw and hurting.  However, there is some metaphor here, but I think each person will find their own.<br />What gripped me about the story was the sometimes hopelessness of life, of being trapped inside the endless task of working without gain, putting all of your sights and ambitions of some small purchase you might make with your efforts, perhaps a radio.  Fighting against the walls of your prison at first, you eventually find that you have become comfortable with your slavery, and then there is no more need to lock the doors.  Your comfort has become your chains.<br />An emotionally challenging and sometimes uncomfortable book, but very rewarding.  I won't be able to look at sand again in the same way.  It doesn't seem quite so innocent anymore.	2004-07-12

All of the elements are here, with the kindly aged father Shingo who cannot gain his children's respect or love, ready to be portrayed by Chishu Ryu, and the lovely and loving daughter-in-law Kikuko, far more understanding than his real children, designed exactly for Setsuko Hara.  The family who has left its rural home to uproot to Tokyo, following the jobs, losing their heart in the process. It really is too perfect.<br />Instead, the story is guided by the gentle hand of Yasunari Kawabata, who gives us the Japanese family, still disheveled by the end of the war and not quite certain what their roles are and dealing with their loss of identity.  Confucian ideals, such as respect for the elder parents, have been swept aside in the post-Occupation reality.  Shingo's son Shuichi has come back from the war an indifferent, cold-hearted man, flaunting his affairs with neither spite nor pleasure.  Shingo's wife, Yasuko, is an ugly reminder of her sister, whom Shingo loved in is youth yet died.  Their daughter Fusako is a burden, returning home with ugly children, her husband a waste and their marriage broken.  The only pleasure in his life is the daughter-in-law Kikuko, whom his son wounds daily with his lack of caring.<br />In the Kawabata style, there is neither complaint nor surface rage at life's inconstant fortunes, but rather an acceptance and perseverance.  Life is about moving forward, even at the advanced age of Shingo and Yasuko, who take their burdens as they come.  Shingo is the main character, and so this is a book of old age, of looking back at life's mistakes and longing for fading pleasures.  &quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot; is a brilliant, cherishable book, one that captivated and moved me.<br />Interestingly enough, &quot;The Sound of the Mountain&quot; was eventually made into a movie, and while Ozu didn't get to direct, Setsuko Hara did get the part of Kikuko.  Someone else must have had the same idea.a did get the part of Kikuko.  Someone else must have had the same idea.	2004-07-01

It tells the tale of the creating and the taming of one of the US's great cities, once a den of crime and vice unimaginable in today's society.  Murderers for hire, unbelievable multi-storied monuments to prostitution and drinking, riots and the like are laid out in grim detail.<br />Gangs like The Dead Rabbits, The Plug Uglies, The Gophers, The Daybreak Boys and The Bowery Bois ruling vast sweeps of New York turf like The Five Points, Hell's Kitchen and Satan's Circus...names to conjure with.  Add into this setting a cast of characters such as Hell-Cat Maggie, Kid Twist, Gyp the Blood and the Paul Bunyonesque character of Mose the Bowery Boi, who even then was known to be a Tall Tale and not a real person, and you have the recipe for some interesting history.<br />However, the book is not all shock-value exploitation.  While written with an eye for excitement, these are real stories of real people, complete with photographs of several prominent gangsters and magazine artwork from the time illustrating the manuscript.  It tells you something of the creating of a city, and how structures are put into place and wildness is tamed.  I was surprised to find out that The New York Times is older than the New York Police Department.  A newspaper was a greater priority than either a police department or a fire department.<br />Anyone expecting an adaptation of the film, however, will be disappointed.  Scorsese pulled characters from history and jumbled them altogether, regardless of the years separating their lives.  It would be like a Western featuring Jessie James, Billie the Kid, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hitchcock, Bat Masterson and several others who were not alive at the same time.  Also, this is a history book, so there is no story as such.  Just the passage of time.	2004-07-01

Along with tea, in the tradition of the Japanese tea ceremony, is the complete picture created by the individual pieces of the art, bowls and whisks and jugs for carrying water.  The various utensils, each with their own pedigree, are only able to find their true use in the hands of a Master of tea.<br /><br />In this story, the metaphor is skillfully brought to play in Kikuji, who has inherited his father's women and guilty past in the same way that he has inherited his tea cottage and collection or rare cups and utensils. Chikako, a discarded mistress of Kikuji's father, is the poisonous Master of tea, manipulating others with the same subtle skill she maneuvers the ceremony. In equal measure, Fumiko, daughter of Kikuji's father's favorite mistress, also struggles under the burden of inherited guilt, even while seeking to escape, giving her mother's tea items to Kikuji as gifts yet not able to free her mind with the same ease.<br /><br />True to Kawabata's style, the unsaid rings much more loudly than the dialog, and surface tone of calm belies a raging whirlpool sucking the characters deeper and deeper.  I found \\"Thousand Cranes\\" a captivating read, and was unable to put it down until I had finished the story.  A small book, it does not lack for power.	2004-06-27

At the clubs, reporters and politicians drink and gossip together, ensuring the the reporters know every detail, even while &quot;requesting&quot; that they print only official statements.  Reporters purposely ditch stories in order to maintain this symbiotic relationship.  Also highlighted is the use of images in Japanese news, as well as the coverage of violent news, and the different vocabulary used for violence within Japan and that on foreign shores.<br />There are several innovative and interesting articles, each providing one more facet of the strange image of Japanese media/politics.  Japanese media as the trickster, for instance, plays off of the anthropological trickster character as one who gets things moving within a society.<br />A fascinating study, although not for casual readers by any means.  &quot;Media and Politics in Japan&quot; is not meant for casual readers, and is best used in context with a course on the subject.	2004-06-21

Many are just the right size for a child's bedtime story. Some of the stories are longer, but I don't think any of them run over 2 or 3 pages.  Some stories have a moral, or tell a cautionary tale, while many are merely there to entertain, frighten or amuse.<br />As interesting as the book itself is the author's introduction, a 35 page quick course on Japanese folklore and mythology.  In it, he outlines some fundamental themes as well as showing the logic behind his categorizing of the stories.<br />An excellent book, belong on the shelf of anyone with an interest in Japanese folklore.	2004-06-07

Introduced into the mix are the crazed American, Tina Foster, and the naive classmate and photo-club member Taeko Minazuki coming on hand as an incompetent maid.  Hijinks ensue.<br />Fortunately, even with the introduction of wacky characters, the focus of the story stays on Aoi and Kaoru, who now must continue their shy courtship in the face of Tina's wild drinking parties, Miyabi watching every move, and Taeko stumbling into every corner.  In a way, the cast becomes much like the Disney cast, with Aoi and Kaoru being the good-hearted Mickey and Minnie, with Goofy (Taeko) and Donald (Tina) causing all sorts of trouble.  The additional cast members are good foils for the wholesome two-some.<br />The editorial reviews seem to place a big emphasis on &quot;fan service,&quot; but I find this not to be the case.  &quot;Ai Yori Aoshi&quot; is one of the sweetest comics I have read, and the story stays true to the heart of its main characters, Aoi and Kaoru and never degenerates into a panty-fest.	2004-05-26

Akutagawa managed to condense despair into its basest elements, then packaged it raw and hurting, yet beautiful and human.  The title story, \\"Roshomon,\\" is a scant 9 1/2 pages long yet you would not wish for a single extra word to be included.<br />Of course, not all the stories in this collection are so dismal.  The longest tale, \\"Yam Gruel,\\" shows something of the wittiness and lightness of \\"Kappa.\\"  Some of the stories, such as the catholic influenced, \\"The Martyr,\\" might be considered uplifting if you take a spiritual lesson from it.  \\"In the Grove,\\" the story that is the basis for the Kurosawa film \\"Rashomon,\\" is an engaging story on the truth and ego and interpretation.  But bleak nonetheless.<br />The translation of \\"Rashomon and Other Stories\\" is excellent, and captures the style and intent beautifully.  It is a very old translation, as can be shown by the translator feeling the need to include a note explaining what \\"sushi\\" is.<br />My single complaint about this book is that, for the price, it is very small indeed.  It could have contained at least double the amount of Akutagawa short stories, which certainly exist, and been a better collection.	2004-05-25

I had always thought that the form of haiku, the 5-7-5 pattern was important but I had never really considered why this pattern mattered, or what one tried to accomplish with a haiku that could not be accomplished with a more free-form style of poetry.<br />This book, &quot;Matsuo Basho,&quot; not only supplies an interesting history of the undisputed master of Japanese haiku, but it also contains an introductory lesson on the different forms of poetry that Basho utilized, the haiku, the renku and the haibun.  Many of Basho's poems are included, both in the original Japanese as well as with a translation, and then interpreted.  The author puts the poem in historical context, as well as gives an idea of the scene that Basho was describing.  It is truly amazing how complete a scene Basho could bring forth using such a limited palette of words.<br />Also included are descriptions of Basho's travel guides, that he wrote on his many voyages across Japan, some highlights of Basho's thoughts on poetry as well as the author's personal interpretation of why Basho has remained a relevant poet, and will continue to remain so.<br />A fascinating book overall, and one that has led me to become interested in haiku and seeking out more books by this amazing writer, Matsuo Basho.	2004-05-15

The story is quite sweet, but with some wacky humor thrown in for good measure, and a few curveball characters.<br />Aside from the usual screwball antics, there is some real tenderness between the two main characters, Kaoru Hanabishi and Aoi Sakuraba, that sets this series apart from other romance-comics.  Also, unlike most in the genre, the two characters are happily in love with each other and they both know it from the very beginning.  This beginning volume sets the stage for the story, introducing the characters and such.  When the full cast is assembled, the fun begins.<br />The inside art is really nice, much better than the covers lead you to believe.  The style is pretty usual, but it is very nicely done.  A great comic, one that you really can't go wrong with.  Pick up this first volume and find yourself hooked!	2004-04-30

Magister Negi Magi, Vol. 1	Books	5	29	29	N	N	Magic and hijinks from the creator of &quot;Love Hina&quot;	From Ken Akamatsu, writer/artist of the popular &quot;Love Hina,&quot; comes &quot;Negima!: Magister Negi Magi.&quot;  This comic follows the adventures of Negi Springfield, a young 10-year old magician from Wales who has been assigned to an all-girls school in Japan as an English teacher for his post-graduation assignment.  The scenario of one guy surrounded by many girls sounds familiar to readers of Japanese comics, but this is quite different from your standard &quot;harem&quot; story.<br />Negi is an entirely likeable character, charming and in over his head, yet determined to do his best in an overwhelming situation.  His dream is to become the Magister, a sort of wandering Master Magician who helps those in trouble.  This being an Akamatsu comic, Negi has the habit of a powerful sneeze which blows girls skirts up, or blasts their clothes off entirely.  His naivety presents this habit from being too silly, and he is always quite shy and embarrassed afterward.<br />He is joined in the regular cast by Asuna Kagurazaka, a 14 year old jr. high school student in Negi's class.  She is a bit of a tom boy, with a powerful kick that can send Negi flying.  Not so much a romantic interest, but a friendly foil for Negi.  Asuna is the only one who knows that Negi is a magician, a fact which must be kept secret.<br />Of course, the Mahora school is no ordinary school, and is filled with all sorts of oddities such as a legendary bath that holds 100 people.  Akamatsu also seems to have a thing for the baths in his comics!  The large cast of characters sets the stage for a variety of adventures, although do to the young age of the characters these adventures are much less romance-orientated than &quot;Love Hina.&quot;<br />This is my favorite Japanese comic being produced right now, and it is nice to see it getting an English release.  Fans of &quot;Love Hina&quot; will find the same kind of humor, with a bit of a Harry Potter sling to it.	2004-04-27

The game itself might have taken second seat to whatever greater picture the author painted.<br />Instead, because this is Kawabata, we have an intimate portrait of three people, the two players and the author himself, basic and alive and honest human beings.  Of course, there is a bit of metaphor and conclusions can be drawn, but ultimately the three people do not require any grandeur beyond there immediate status as human beings.  It is enough.<br />The Master of Go himself, the highest available rank in the official Go association, is a portrait of obsession and dedication.  He is only comfortable playing games, and even amidst his failing health and the demands of his retirement challenge, he ensnares anyone around him in any game possible, be in Mah Jong or Billiards.  His opponent, a young yet high ranking challenger, has fought his way through a year-long tournament for the honor of being the opponent in the Master's final match.  High strung, and with health issues of his own, he brings everything he has to defeat the Master in his last game.  The author, a newspaper reporter assigned to cover the match which is being sponsored by his paper, unable to penetrate the minds of the two players, lays open his own feelings and interpretations while retaining a newspaperman's eye for reporting facts rather than speculation.<br />Kawabata, being the real-life newspaper reporter who covered the real-life game, uses his simple writing style and honest narrative to bring to life this competition in a more riveting manner than any metaphor.  Charts of the games progress are used to explain the moves, details are brought forth regarding the health of the players, and the history of the match.  In amazement, he manages to maintain tension in the story even though the outcome of the match is told in the first few paragraphs.  The chapters are tiny, making the book as unable to put down as a bag of potato chips, as there always seems to be room for one more.<br />Knowledge of Go is not necessary for this book, although a basic understanding of the rules will help put things into perspective.  The translation is good, but I don't like Seidensticker translates Japanese games like Shogi as Chess, even though they are not the same game.  The notes at the end are very insightful however, and help fill in some of the gaps of Go-knowledge.than any metaphor.

However, there are cross indexes of organization by chronology and religious tradition if needed.<br />The book is scholarly in nature, and would not be a valuable book for anyone seeking insights into their spirituality or to open their third eye.  However, anyone with an interest in or making a serious study of the religions of Japan needs &quot;Religions of Japan in Practice.&quot;	2004-04-10

Each element contributes a unique flavor, and a different facet of Kawabata's style.<br />J. Martin Holman proves himself again a master translator of Kawabata, retaining the flow and most importantly the feeling of the originals, far more than other translators I have read.  The only flaw I found was that he splits the book into two sections, which I personally found a bit jarring.  I think it more naturally flows into three distinct chapters.<br />&quot;The Dancing Girl of Izu&quot; is as fine a short story as you are likely to read anywhere.  Every necessary element is contained, with no superfluous decoration.  It is heartbreaking in its subtlety, and masterful in its craft.  Everything important is unsaid. Kawabata can manipulate emotions so deeply using so little, leaving the reader with an aching emptiness as great as that of the narrator.  Beautiful, and fully worth the cost of the collection alone.<br />&quot;Diary of my Sixteenth Year,&quot; &quot;Oil,&quot; &quot;The Master of Funerals&quot; and &quot;Gathering Ashes&quot; are four short autobiographical sketches of Kawabata's relationship with his only relative, a blind grandfather who would figure into several tales.  Not factual per se, but true impressions.  They present an intimate portrait of youth trying to understand the aged, of responsibility and resentment of responsibility, and of the numbness of death.  The stories are presented as recovered diary accounts Kawabata wrote when he was 16, and they may be so.  I believe the feelings, and that is enough.<br />The third section contains the 18 remaining unpublished palm-of-the-hand stories, Kawabata's personal trademark and contribution to literature.  A page or three at the most, each story functions like a Zen koan, a story or riddle with no obvious meaning used as a contemplation tool by meditating monks to clear their minds and make them go hmmm...as they try to decipher.  Koans have been called &quot;extremely brief vignettes enabling the individual to hold entire universes of thought in mind all at once,&quot; and I think this sums it up nicely.

Things like being stared at on public transportation, language leeches hitting you for some free English lessons, being laughed at for speaking Japanese, etc...<br />I have personally encountered almost every situation in the book, with the exception of the ones about being overcharged, and I have to say I did get a few chuckles from reading this.  I don't know how well it works for learning new Japanese phrases, as the book is all in romaji and gives no grammar tips or direct translation of what is being said.  You are more likely to make a greater fool of yourself trying to use these phrases.<br />It is good for a laugh, and would make a nice gift to anyone in Japan for an extended stay.	2004-04-06

Utilizing the National Geographic's excellent collection of photographs and information, they have assembled one of the most eye-popping and enticing guides to Japan that I have seen, and I have seen quite a few of them.<br />The various regions of Japan are well-covered, with an emphasis on major locations, sights and activities.  There is not much &quot;off-the-beaten&quot; path type of information, but that is not what this kind of  guide is for.  The locations that are covered are covered very well, with both information, best times to visit and so one.  Wisely, there is little in the way of pricing information, as this is quickly outdated.  The experience of National Geographic is well-leveraged, giving a more informed picture over the &quot;Eyewitness&quot; guides.<br />I recommend this guide to anyone who is interested in or considering a trip to Japan, but is somewhat unfamiliar with the country and what it has to offer.  There is plenty here to pique your interest.	2004-03-28

(Can't you just hear the theme music!)<br />This second volume continues Tezuka's familiar themes, exploring the political and emotional impact of robot populations, are they second class citizens or individual beings, do they have souls and emotions?  All very common themes in modern Science Fiction, but Tezuka did it first here.<br />There are 3 stories, the first featuring Astro Boy and a plot to prevent robot voting rights, the second staring a robot magician who's body is stolen yet who's soul remains his own, and a final story of Astro Boy's love for a special plant and the story behind it.  All 3 stories are very well crafted, blending entertainment with social commentary seamlessly.  A great series for parents looking for comics for their kids.<br />The only problem with the Dark Horse presentation is the order in which the series are released.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the order, and volume 2 has two new characters appear, Uran and Cobalt, without any explanation or origin.	2004-03-12

When reading books like &quot;The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea&quot; (Japanese title is &quot;Gogo no Eiko,&quot; or &quot;Afternoon of Glory&quot;), one cannot help but think of his suicide, his politics, his private army, etc... However, a masterpiece such as this deserves to be judged on its literary merits rather than the politics of its author.<br />&quot;The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea&quot; is a stark book, running both cold and passionately hot as the children who attempt to be intellectually dispassionate, all the while feeling the fluxing emotions of adolescence.  A young boy's hero, a Sailor full of bravado and the masculine glory of searching for the horizon and always leaving women behind, finds himself changing his ideals with inklings of romantic love and home and hearth and comfort.  The young boy who idolizes him cannot forgive these trespasses.  The Sailor must remain a pure hero, uncorrupted by sentimentality.<br />The purity of the mother is a running theme in Japanese fiction, and Mishima plays with societies ideas of mothers and sons.  A mother is supposed to live for her son, and cannot be a woman to any other man.  A husband is supposed to be distant and other.  An unattainable ideal, but not an actual person.<br />Such knowledge of Japanese society helps inform this book, but it is not necessary.  The emotions on display are raw and offer and uncompromising glimpse into the psyche of another culture but are also understandable by people of every culture.  In fact, in an interesting note, &quot;The Sailor who Fell from Grace with the Sea&quot; is far more famous in the United States than it is in Japan, where it is counted as one of Mishima's lesser books.  Perhaps it is a work more in tune with the American psyche than the Japanese.	2004-03-05

A great amount of information is packed into this slim volume.  Each of the 39 adventures is a view point.<br />While not exactly an &quot;off the beaten path&quot; type of guide, there is plenty here to compliment a Lonely Planet or Frommer's.  &quot;Little Adventures in Tokyo&quot; is more like having a friend showing you around his beloved city, from the top sites to his favorite hole-in-the-wall.  Major attractions like Tsukiji, the famous fresh fish market (Adventure 10), are illuminated in fine detail.  Interesting little bits like where to go for avante-guarde theater (Adventure 27) show an entirely different side.  Variety is the key here, ranging from high priced to free, from esoteric to amusement.<br />The book is very well written, and can be read as a traveler's tales account of Tokyo in its own right, as well as used as a guide book.  Several of the adventures I will never do, but I enjoyed reading about them all the same.  It seems to be written a little more for residents than casual travelers, as several of the Adventures take some time.<br />The only word of warning is to take the prices with a grain of salt, as in Japan's rapidly changing economy things don't stay the same for long.  I found everything to be about 100 yen more than the guide prices.	2004-02-13

Richie makes a difference between visitors, such as General Grant, and residents, such as Lafcadio Hearn. This book is interested only in the traveler's tales.<br />The list of visitors is honorable indeed, ranging from early Meiji-era folks such as Victorian travel writer Isabella Bird, former US President Ulysses S. Grant, true romance novelist Pierre Loti, humorist Henry Adams, to literary figures of various ages such as Rudyard Kipling, Aldous Huxley, Jean Cocteau, William Faulkner and Truman Capote.  Some oddballs such as Charlie Chaplin also contribute.  All came to Japan with expectations.  All saw Japan through their own particular perspectives.<br />Perspective is what is really being offered in &quot;The Honorable Travelers.&quot;  People react strongly to Japan, and many seem to find wildly opposite discoveries and adventures.  The Victorian travelers brought their snobbery and sense of important superiority.  Later travelers came seeking the Japanese &quot;other,&quot; only to find disappointingly that Japan was just a real place with real human beings.<br />As a somewhat long-term resident in Japan, I found the book both sad and enlightening.  Sad, in seeing the colonial abuse of people such as Pierre Loti, who bought a girl for $20, married her and then left her behind solely so that he could write a scandalous, racy novel of loose-moraled Japan and her exotic women.  Enlightening, in that I can see some perspectives in myself, from when I first came to Japan, or in the faces or friends and family who visit.<br />People still come like Loti, seeking an exotic love affair with a Japanese woman, giving little thought to her as a person.  People still come like Kipling, allowing the country to be what it is, without bias or worship.  Given of what I know of Japan today, I tend to wish it's past and present had more Kiplings and fewer Lotis.<br />While quite tiny in size, good for a weekend read, &quot;The Honorable Visitors&quot; is an important book for those willing to look at Japan from many angles, and from many insights.what I know of Japan today, I tend to wish it's past and present had more Kiplings and fewer Lotis.<br />While quite tiny in size, good for a weekend read, &quot;The Honorable Visitors&quot; is an important book for those willing to look at Japan from many angles, and from many insights.	2004-02-12

A good furigana dictionary serves a dual purpose of familiarizing you with the kana, as you need to know it in order to look up words, as well as being a functional dictionary.<br />While too basic for advanced students, the number of words should be sufficient for beginner and intermediate students.  Of course, a bound dictionary will never be able to compete with an electronic dictionary for number of words and convenience, but the arduous process of looking up words the old fashioned way seems to help with retention, as well as mastering the kana.<br />Even absolute beginners should walk into their first Japanese class with this dictionary in their pocket.	2004-02-03

Ian Buruma has gathered together a host of Japanese storytelling, from theater, film, comics and books, and sifted through them all to divine the core elements of the Japanese hero.  What traits do the Japanese respect?  What do their heroes embody?  What are their stereotypes, their Dirty Harrys and Al Capones?<br />The book is split into two sections, the first section dealing with women and the second section with men, as well as a bridging chapter on cross-dressers.  The section on women show the long suffering, devoted mother, the innocent schoolgirls, the vile demon-women seducers and the art of prostitution.  The section on men show the loyal retainer, the hard school and nihilism of the yakuza, and the idiocy of fathers.  Each stereotype is supported with a host of evidence from many different media types.<br />The most repeating storyline, and the most important lesson for the Japanese, is that he who acts outside society is doomed.  Like all culture's storytelling, Japanese books, films and theater seem to reinforce a comfortable lesson, allowing people to vicariously watch rebels get their just due.<br />Also of interest in this book is the lack of core good/evil myths in Japanese religion, and how this affects their storytelling and how this disturbs and confuses Western viewers.  Violence for violence's sake, without a moral lesson, is often found in Japanese storytelling.  After reading this book, you will have a better idea of why.<br />The weakness of this book is that, regardless of the title, the focus is on heroes.  There are not really any villains mentioned.  Also, as the book was written in the 1980's, many of the current &quot;hot&quot; stars and stories mentioned by the author have faded into obscurity, which dates the book somewhat.<br />&quot;The Japanese Mirror&quot; is a great book for anyone interested in Japanese culture and/or film.

While they are gothic in the sense of being somewhat in the style of gothic literature, they are not really gothic in the modern sense of the word.  In other words, this is not a straight forward collection of horror stories.  Kyoka may very well be Japan's Edgar Allen Poe, as has been maintained before, but if so it is because of his effective use of atmosphere and the short story, rather than his themes.<br />Instead of horror, it is a sampling of Kyoka's unique and somewhat complicated style of storytelling.  His use of layers and misdirection, of drifting back and forth in time and story without offering life-lines to the readers creates an atmosphere of disquiet far more than any ghosts of monsters.  Kyoka is particularly difficult to read even for native Japanese speakers, and he is incredibly difficult to translate.<br />&quot;The Surgery Room&quot; offers a traditional Japanese tale of impossible love and the consequences it leads to.  More than anything, it reminds me of one of Road Dahl's adult short stories.  Sharp and cutting like a scalpel.<br />&quot;The Holy Man of Mt. Koya&quot; is probably the most straight forward tale, and rates the cover of the book.  A mountain ghost story that is both chilling and thought-provoking.

These mini series are almost always superior to the regular ongoing series, as they are not tied down by subplots and the rush of a monthly deadline.<br />\\"Batgirl: Year One\\" is an excellent amalgam of the old and the new, incorporating important elements of Batgirl's mythology, such as Killer Moth and the costume party she makes the Batgirl suit for, while successfully incorporation new Batman lore such as the jump lines and modern technology.  Gone is the Utility-Handbag and the Batgirl who would stop fighting the Joker (nice foreshadowing of the Joker, by the way) if she got a run in her stocking.  The modern Barbara Gordon is a capable partner in crime fighting.<br />The art in the series is excellent, and stays in tone with the rest of the Year One series, maintaining a slightly retro-feel.  The colors are dark and mysterious, lending a nice tone to the story.<br />An altogether excellent mini-series.	2004-01-17

Kawabata is one of Japan's most respected authors, and &quot;Snow Country&quot; is his masterpiece.  However, that does not mean that this is a book for everyone, or that everyone will necessarily understand or enjoy the novel.  In fact, I got my copy as a cast-off from a friend who said it was incredibly boring and he didn't want to keep it.<br />It is a demanding read, one that expects the reader to be able to catch the substance of the unsaid, the implied.  Almost nothing is spoon-fed.  There is no action, no crisis, nothing that most literary traditions has lead readers to expect from a novel.  It demands patience, even though it is a slender volume.<br />Personally, I found it captivating, and intensely deep and moving.  Having read other Kawabata, I was prepared for the subtlety of style and the sparseness of language and story that is his trademark.  He is the inheritor of the Haiku, which implies with as few words as necessary.  The emotional depth of the novel is incredibly deep, much deeper than many novels I have read who express with much more fanciful language.  The Geisha and the Dilettante, the one who affects love but cannot know true love, and the one who gives herself to love even though she knows it cannot be.  It is a passionless affair, yet intense.  Like the snow country itself, the landscape of their hearts is sparse, yet life lies under the surface covering of insulation.<br />I did find the translation annoying and disappointing, and I was surprised to find such a lackluster translation on one of Japan's premier novels.  The constant use of quotations for &quot;mountain trousers,&quot; for instance, instead of just naming it once and using the Japanese term.  I am sure that a better translation could capture the novel even better, and perhaps transport it for a new audience.<br />All in all, one of the best Japanese novels that I have read.  Simply incredible, and worth the time.  But remember your patience.	2004-01-14

The trail leads to Captain Co-co, who takes Jack SCUBA diving in Jaguar Reef, where two things are found.  A set of skeletons playing chess, in an underwater pirate shipwreck, and a keg of Viper Rum, nectar of the rum gods.  Back on the surface, knocking back some Viper Rum with Captain Co-co, the adventure begins in earnest.

It is the least academic of his works, collecting together some of Japan's core ghost and monster stories into one slim volume.  Much like the Brothers Grimm, Hearn did not actually create these stories but rather compiled them and put them into written form for the first time, learning them from folk tales and storytellers.<br />Along with famous, \\"Kwaidan\\" is Hearn's most influential book.  \\"The Story of Mimi-nashi Hoichi\\" is as well-known in Japan as \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is in the United States.  The \\"Yuki Onna\\" has made it into a few films, including Kurosawa's \\"Dreams\\" and the filmed version of this book, \\"Kwaidan.\\"<br />The stories themselves are of excellent quality, ranging from spooky ghost tales to humorous tales of wandering monks encountering monsters.

Three women, all in love with someone emotionally of physically dead, all troubled sleepers, all drinkers, try to find rest and quietude that is not found in sleep.  Each aspect is a metaphor for the unconscious, where perhaps the answers lie.  For in this sleep of death, who know what dreams may come?  Girlfriend in a coma, I know, I know it's really serious.  Drink, don't think.  Seeking answers, the women look to their friends, their family, magical dwarfs or anyone who can help.<br />&quot;Asleep&quot; is told in Yoshimoto style, like a story overheard with half-open eyes while drifting off to sleep.  It is semi-magical and dreamy, but still in touch with the real world.  The pacing, the narrative are all influenced by classical Japanese literature.  Her writing is very gentle, very feminine.  And poetic.<br />An enjoyable, lazy book.  Good for seekers of love and those who cannot sleep at night.	2003-12-28

Included is the origin story of Mighty Atom/Astro Boy, a longer tale which takes up 2/3's of the book, about cyborg dogs called the Hot Dog Corps, and a third tale about living plants.  The stories are in no particular chronological order, and are selected more for feel and quality than anything else.  Tezuka has included a few self-introductions featuring himself as a cartoon character.<br />Of good interest also are an introduction to the series, including notes on translation and selection.  The translator attempted to preserve the Japanese names as much as possible, including nicknames, keeping only the Americanized Astro Boy instead of the direct translation Mighty Atom, as Astro Boy is the more familiar name.<br />Astro Boy is a lot like the Mickey Mouse of Japan, and his good-natured adventures are as much fun to read as the early Mickey Mouse comics.  The difference comes in social issues, as Tezuka clearly uses his character to tackle ethical/political issues that interested him at the times, raising the comic up several notches.	2003-12-27

The collection was assembled by translator Matt Thorn, who was doing his Doctorate studies on Japanese Shojo manga, a media form he felt was unique to Japan, and missing from American comics.<br />Each of the stories is of the highest quality, both in writing and art.  It is not often that young girls are given something with this level of maturity and respect.  A far cry from Sailor Moon!  And an even farther cry from She-Ra and Strawberry Shortcake!<br />That being said, as an adult male I was able to enjoy each of these stories for the intimacy and storytelling, as well as the universal emotions that they express.  Japanese, American, or what ever country, there is something to relate to and cherish here for everyone.<br />A real shame that it is out of print. Definitely worth tracking down.	2003-12-23

However, there is far more hear than ultra-violence and simplistic teenage slaughter.<br />First, the writing is brilliant, combing the subtlety of classical Japanese literature with the aggression and confrontation of European/American political literature.  Each of the 40 students are individuals, with unique motivations and personalities.  There are no throw-away scenes or off-screen deaths, and each student's demise is made to feel intimate and important.  Each life matters.<br />Second, the issues dealt with are legion, from the conformity of Japanese schools to the insane bureaucracy and immobility of the Japanese political system.  Along with this are more personal issues of loyalty, pain and loss.  &quot;Battle Royale&quot; is a thick book, with a lot packed inside.  I would imagine that those more fluent in modern Japanese politics and social issues would grasp some of the subtler messages, but there is still something here for everyone.<br /><br />A minor complaint is that the students act nothing like Jr. High School students, especially not Japanese ones.  Maybe this is how they would like to be, but there are a few too many &quot;super-heroes&quot; amongst them, a a few too few crybabies.  However, as this is an alternate-reality setting, perhaps in the &quot;Battle Royale&quot; world kids grow up a little faster.	2003-12-20

A college with a fine collection  of supernatural-themed Japanese art, in a variety of mediums, decides to offer an interdisciplinary study class with each group producing papers on a folklore theme, with supporting artwork from the collection.  Brilliant.<br />Each of the chapters is incredibly insightful, providing a complete education on the topic.  Along with the traditional subjects such as the Oni, Ghosts and Tengu, there are many less-often covered subjects such as Sennin: The Immortals of Taoism and Shoki the Demon Queller.  I was particularly pleased to learn about Shoki, as I was browsing a print shop in Kyoto and was able to recognize the Demon Queller himself in a few prints.<br />The plates are, of course, beautiful, and cover an incredible range of medium, from the familiar prints to the drawings, paintings and netsuke carvings.  The reproduction quality is high, and the size of the book is &quot;coffee table&quot; size, allowing for nice sized images.  The majority of the plates are in full color.<br />As someone who has read quite a few books on Japanese supernatural folklore, I recommend &quot;Japanese Ghosts and Demons&quot; as one of the best.  It would be hard to be disappointed by this treasure.	2003-12-19

I feel a bit mislead by &quot;Lost,&quot; what with the excellent cover art and the blurb on back promising distant connections with &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and Ebenezer Scrooge.  I was expecting the ghost of the old miser to make an appearance eventually, perhaps this time in the Marley role, but old Scrooge turned out to be a minor character, much like Saucy Jack, Peter Pan, and the host of other literary characters who pop in and out of the main characters active imagination.<br />Instead, the story is set in very modern London, with a writer whose past is haunted by more than ghosts, and whose present is a muddled, complex mystery of human emotion.  Throughout, she is constantly searching for a story, and one feels that &quot;Lost&quot; is also searching for a story, but it always remains just out of reach.<br />Having a decent background in English literature and fact is helpful in understanding the book.  I have read Alan Moore's &quot;From Hell,&quot; so I am somewhat familiar with the Jack the Ripper murders and of course I have read &quot;A Christmas Carol.&quot;  These stories are used as a frame over which the main story is stretched.<br />All in all, I enjoyed the various twists and turns, misleading back alleys and strange adventures that &quot;Lost&quot; took me on, and had I been better prepared for the type of book that it is, I would have enjoyed it more.	2003-12-17

It is an interesting style that attempts to ape classical Japanese literature, infusing it with Ishiguro's innate Brittishness, coming from being born of Japanese parents but raised in Britain.<br />As with his other novels, and part of his style, a knowledge of historical events is taken for granted on the part of the reader.  Allusions are made to once-famous or infamous events and people, and names are dropped with the understanding that everyone is intimately familiar with WWII and the cultures of Japan and England.<br />The title is a bit misleading, as the \\"Floating World\\" is usually associated with the Edo period of Japan, and not with the Fascist era of Showa.  Anyone expecting Geishas and Samurai will be disappointed.<br />A very quick and quiet read, \\"An Artist of the Floating World\\" is something than can be read over a weekend with a cup of green tea.  It contributes a viewpoint, and a necessary one, to WWII Japan and paints a human face onto a troubled period of history.  Love and family and duty are on display here, along with good intentions leading down dark paths, and the righteousness of actions and re-actions.<br />Like \\"Remains of the Day,\\" \\"An Artist of the Floating World\\" is an intimate, beautiful character sketch.  Very much worth the limited time needed to enjoy the book.	2003-12-12

Sure, pretty much everything in here is true, but it is offered with such personal venom that one starts to feel a bit dirty and sensationalist after a few chapters.<br />It is disappointing that Alex Kerr cannot separate his personal gripes from real, honest troubles with Japan today, and that is the main failing of the book.  Opinions and facts mix with no attempt to filter or quantify which is subjective and which is objective.  Artistic taste is an equal yardstick to hard data.  He has his personal &quot;Dogs&quot; and &quot;Demons&quot; to wrangle with, and he was not so successful.  A good editor would have done wonders also, as the book is ripe with redundancy, logic errors, and poor information flow.<br />Disappointing indeed, because &quot;Dogs and Demons&quot; is a very important book, packed with vital information and offering a point-of-view that everyone interested in modern Japan should be aware of.  It is definitely required reading.  The harsh reality of the &quot;construction state&quot; are visible to all who live and travel in Japan.  The economic stewpot of corruption and old rules is also dangerously true.<br />The book falls apart in the last chapters, when it becomes about personal aesthetics as opposed to objective criticism.  He is woefully unknowledgeable and overly-opinionated about the Japanese school system and Japanese film.  Notice how the quotes and facts vanish in these chapters.  It pains me to think that any readers would take these chapters are fact.<br />All in all, a good book and a must-read, but one that requires a very large grain of salt.	2003-12-12

Helen McCarthy deserves praise for getting this book out in the first place, and it is certainly not terrible.<br />The book is full of justifiable praise for Miyazaki, and is clearly intended to be a fan book rather than a critical analysis of his films.  Each film gets its own chapter, with a heavily detailed plot synopsis of each film (completely unnecessary to those who have actually seen the films) making up the bulk of the book.  Lists of characters and character backgrounds are also included.  There are several blatant factual/story errors in her interpretation, which makes me think a better editor might have been useful.<br />There is some attempt at critical analysis, and it is appreciated, but more depth would have been better.  There is a touch of history about Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and a smap of detail about animation technology, but not enough to provide any real insight or background.  I cannot say that I came away from this book with a deeper appreciation of his films.<br />As a fan book, it is strangely lacking in pictures and rare information.  Photographs of interesting Ghibli products would have been appreciated, or rare character sketches or anything that cannot be gleaned from the films themselves.  In many ways, that is its main failing.  If you have the movies, there is no need for this book.	2003-12-12

It is modeled after the &quot;Kanji Pictographix&quot; book, using a mnemonic picture in the general shape of the kana.<br />While it may be effective for some people, for me it is just a little too easy.  Learning the two simple kana alphabets is not very difficult, and does not require mnemonic pictures.  I found a workbook, which uses repetitive writing exercises followed by simple quizzes, to be a much more effective learning method.	2003-12-12

It is a wacky Ninja tale, complete with magic nine-tailed foxes and secret ninja techniques.  Anyone looking for even a grain of historical accuracy should look elsewhere, as &quot;Naruto&quot; is just about the hijinks.  Definitely nothing subtle here, just &quot;pie-in-the-face&quot; style of humor and laughs.<br />This first volume, &quot;The Tests of the Ninja,&quot; lays the groundwork, including Naruto's origin and the cast of supporting characters.  While stereotypes abound, each is interesting enough and offers some unique drama.<br />The art is nice, although not groundbreaking, and suits the funky story.  Viz's decision to run the book in the correct way, right to left, is really appreciated as the artwork can be original an un-flipped as it is in most English-translated manga series.<br />One note: as someone who has read both the Japanese version and the English, the translation is excellent.  No worries there.	2003-11-08

This survey is essential to understanding the Japanese religious character and is a core to anyone studying the topic.<br />The remainder of the book is the religious situation today, and deals with such subjects as religion and the state, religion and education, Urbanization, depopulation and religion, and the aspects or rebirth of religion.<br />The book is quite academic in nature, and indeed is intended to be a textbook.  It is not recommended for those with a casual interest, but is essential for those pursuing a serious study of modern Japanese culture and the role religion plays in it.	2003-11-02

Scott Littleton's &quot;Shinto: Origins, Ritual, Festivals, Spirits and Sacred Places&quot; is a surprisingly good guide to Japan's native religion, considering its small size and ease of reading.  This thin book takes a respectful look at Shinto's origin, main tenants, major characters, sacred texts and theology.  The information is quite scholarly, as befits an Oxford Press publication.<br />It is a very brief overview, and should be considered as an introductory book for anyone who wants to quickly understand Shinto without dedicating considerable time.  Only the very main aspects are introduced, and many controversial elements, such as the inclusion of Tenri-kyo amongst the Shinto sects, are never touched on.  Other things such as the nature of kami and their role in Japanese society over time, are not developed well, and could lead to some misunderstandings regarding the kami.  However, this is to be expected in such a small book.<br />There are several lovely pictures, but all in all this book is more text than photo-guide, as it should be.  It is impressive to see Shinto so well-condensed, allowing for a general understanding of the religion in such a short time.	2003-11-02

It has been a difficult tale to interpret in Japan, being hailed as either a children's story, a social satire or simply weird.  Akutagawa himself feared insanity due to his mother's mental deterioration during his youth, and his own justified fear of the taint of madness in his blood.<br />Akutagawa's mental state when writing &quot;Kappa&quot; is important background, and the paperback edition comes with an extensive mini-biography of the famous author that is almost the size of the story itself.  Akutagawa never wrote novels, and it is strange to see a single story packaged in one book.  The introduction/biography is well written as well, and helps to reveal the story.<br />The writing in &quot;Kappa&quot; is sharp and quick-witted.  The satire is equal parts clever and odd.  Religion, marriage, arts and entertainment, all are in part skewered and skewed.  The book is an incredibly fast read, and one that you will want to pass to your friends to read as well, so that you can see what someone else makes of it.	2003-10-29

Although a re-defining of Hirohito is a point of the book, it is not the main point when it comes to sheer volume of text.  Much more is devoted to the shaping of Japan as a country, from the Meiji roots, through the militarization of WWII and back out again, under the US occupation, and finally independent again till the death of Hirohito.<br />What is there of Hirohito is maybe 95% intelligent speculation, strung together from official texts and guarded and unguarded moments of his confidants.  Being the Emperor of Japan, almost every public face of Hirohito is tightly controlled, and as the author admits, there is little to no access to the private thoughts or personal convictions of the Showa Emperor.<br />Bix does an excellent job with the available material, however, and makes a good case for a considerably stronger role for Hirohito during WWII than was sold to the world.  I am sure that he is closer to the truth than the official position, and &quot;closer to the truth&quot; is probably the best we will ever get, unless the Imperial Family releases his private diaries, which is an unlikely move.<br />&quot;Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan&quot; does make for an excellent history book for those like me, who are largely ignorant of this period of Japanese history.  I certainly am more well-informed than I was before, and interested enough to continue learning.  Bix's writing style is academic, and not really there to capture the imagination and make history &quot;come alive,&quot; so reading the book is a commitment.<br />Of special interest is the growth of military power from the Japanese point-of-view, and the understanding how fear of economically and militarily powerful countries like the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union can cause less wealthy, less developed countries to take steps to protect themselves from assimilation.  There is a definite lesson to be learned here, with what happened in Japan and what is happening now with the Middle Eastern countries.

There is a true story of an accurate fortune teller know to the author, in &quot;A Story of Divination.&quot; &quot;Bits of Poetry&quot; and &quot;Japanese Buddhist Proverbs&quot; translates and teaches several bits of Japanese lore as they relate to the world of the dead.<br />Some essays, such as &quot;Silkworms,&quot; are pure conjecture, relating the human ideals of paradise to the daily lives of silkworms. &quot;Suggestion&quot; is a conversation between the author and a monk on the nature of gender and re-birth in the Buddhist tradition.<br />Of true ghost stories, there are few. Many of the ghost stories, such as &quot;Furisode,&quot; begin with a short lesson about something Japanese, in this case a long-sleeved Kimono known as a Furisode, and then relates a ghost story dealing with the object. Some, such as &quot;Ingwa-banashi,&quot; are pure chilling horror that make you cringe. Other true ghost stories in this collection are &quot;Story of a Tengu,&quot; &quot;Ululation,&quot; &quot;Fragment&quot; and &quot;A Passional Karma.&quot;<br />One of my favorites, a short story called &quot;At Yaidzu,&quot; tells of the author swimming out amongst the Obon lanterns, which are put to see to guide home the spirits of the dead, and the feeling he gets being in the Ocean amongst the returning dead. Truly creepy.<br />All in all, &quot;In Ghostly Japan&quot; is a bit more scholarly than ghastly. The writing style is like many books from the 1880's, a bit dry and non-thrilling. It is a good resource for learning about the Ghostly traditions of Japan, but those seeking a collection of Japanese ghost stories will be disappointed.st stories will be disappointed.	2003-10-13

Heart, Spirit, Way of Being...it is all of these things.  Rather than attempt a direct translation, Lafcadio Hearn offers a selection of stories focusing on Japanese inner life, so that by the end you will understand kokoro.<br />The stories follow Hearn's particular interests of Japanese folklore and the vanishing culture of which he found himself a part in post-Meji Japan.  Each story is a slice of life focusing on Japanese character, morals and feelings.  This is what the Japanese people care about, what they think is important, what is inside.<br />The selected tales are non-judgmental and non-orientalist.  This is no attempt to explain or highlight the &quot;strange&quot; Japanese, but merely a record and an illumination, in the best sense of the term.<br />The collected stories:<br />&quot;At a Railway Station&quot;<br />&quot;The Genius of Japanese Civilization&quot;<br />&quot;A Street Singer&quot;<br />&quot;From a Traveling Diary&quot;<br />&quot;The Nun of the Temple of Amida&quot;<br />&quot;After the War&quot;<br />&quot;Haru&quot;<br />&quot;A Glimpse of Tendencies&quot;<br />&quot;By Force of Karma&quot;<br />&quot;A Conservative&quot;<br />&quot;In the Twilight of the Gods&quot;<br />&quot;The Idea of Pre-Exsistance&quot;<br />&quot;In Cholera Time&quot;<br />&quot;Some Thoughts about Ancestor Worship&quot;<br />&quot;Kimiko&quot;	2003-10-07

It focuses on the cities of Tokyo, Kyoto and Nara rather than the precectures, which is like buying a guidebook to Oklahoma and finding that it only covers Oklahomo City, ignoring the rest of the state.<br />This book achieves a nice balance between history lesson and guiding, which is necessary for a Japanese guidebook as you may not understand what you are seeing wihout some background.  Maybe the first 100 pages are history/culture/etiquette type of thing. Anyone with a limited background in Japan would do well to read this section before making their trip.<br />The citie guides come in a little thin, but better than a general &quot;Japan&quot; guidebook, with maybe about 80 pages for Tokyo,  60 for Kyoto and 30 for &quot;ancient&quot; Nara, which befits the size of the three cities.  There is a token 5 pages for Osaka, which is unhelpful as anyone coming to Nara and Kyoto are likely to visit Osaka as well, as it is close.  It is enough information for a day or so in each city, and covers what you need for the major destinations and sights.<br />Tokyo, Kyoto and Nara are all must-sees on any travel itenary to Japan, so having them all in one book is convenient.  Whereas Kyoto and Nare are close together in the Kansai region, Tokyo is relatively far away.  If you have the money for it, however, the bullet train makes all distances irrelevant.<br />The book is lacking of photographs of any sort, which makes the Eyewitness guides superior.  Also missing is suggested day trips or walking tours. Which help to make for a great guidebook.  The book is a nice size, however, and easily portable.	2003-09-13

I was expecting a &quot;magical kitchen&quot; type story, like &quot;Water for Chocolate&quot; where the kitchen is a metaphor or someplace where things happen.  I was expecting cooking and ingredients, detailed recipes, manic energy and that sort of thing.<br />Instead, I got three sweet novellas, only two of them directly connected, about unspoken emotions and complex relationships, with the kitchen playing little more role than the title.  Much of my expectations came from Banana Yoshitomo's being hailed as a &quot;young author&quot; in Japan.  A young author she may be, but she carries the legacy of Japanese literature and influence, and her subtle, underplayed emotions and simple/complex characters and plots are as alive and moving as Soseki.<br />There is magic here, of a quaint sort.  And a ghost of two.  A transvestite.  But for the most part, this is the real world.  The three novellas are connected in tone, if not in plot and characters.  Each has its own charm, and each carries and ocean of depth beneath a seemingly shallow surface, which is the hallmark of Japanese literature.  Love moves the world, but lovers must find and recognize each other.<br />Simply, a great book.	2003-09-11

Inside this slim volume is a testament of spirit, of youth and age, of man and woman, of ancient and modern juxtapositions of kokoro.  What is love?  What is friendship?  What is responsibility?<br />The writing style is slow and delicate, with a precise economy of ideas and words.  The translation is excellent, lending credible authenticity to the language.  The Ideas, of course, need little interpretation as they are human in nature, and can be understood by all.  Small cultural notes, such as the important suicide of General Nogi, are wisely footnoted and explained to deepen understanding of the narrative.<br />The simple story of Sensei, his wife, the young man and his family lay a basic framework upon which to weave the emotions that are the true focus.<br />Overall, while a book with an extremely Japanese flavor, it does transcend the barriers and gets at the inner life, the kokoro.	2003-08-28

Making his way through the mythologies and folklore of several countries, he encounters beasties like Japanese vampires, King Vold and Roger.  Well-researched, Mignola threads together these various traditionals into a cohesive story, with the Christian God and Devil at the center, and Hellboy bridging the gap.<br />By far some of the most intelligent and well-written stories in modern comics, Hellboy never disappoints.  Non-comics readers as well enjoy Hellboy, and my copy has been well-read by many people.  \\"Hellboy: The Right Hand of Doom\\" is an excellent starting point, and can be read with no previous knowledge of the characters.<br />\\"He has eaten the pancakes.

As an MA student studying religion in Japan, this book was recommended as a starting place, and I found it invaluable.<br />Ian Reader lays out how religion is treated in Japan, what its general effect is on everyday life, and explores some of the more hidden corners of the Zen Buddhist temples and the new-new religions.  Don't expect information on doctrines or specifics of any particular religion.  This is far more of a sociological treatment than a theological one.<br />Of particular interest, I enjoyed his comments on the holy sites of Japan, and how they have been transformed to serve tourist interests.  Also, his insights into the modern religion of Agonshu are very interesting, and highlights the modern &quot;invention of tradition&quot; found in Neo-pagan religions in the US.  I found it interesting that this same phenomenon, of trying to link back to a mythical past, also existed in Japan.<br />Specific areas touched upon are &quot;Turning to the Gods in times of trouble,&quot; &quot;Unifying Traditions, &quot; &quot;Born Shinto, Die Buddhist,&quot; &quot;Individuals, Ascetics and Expressions of Power,&quot; &quot;Sites and Sights,&quot; &quot;Actions, Amulets and the Expression of Meaning,&quot; &quot;Spirits, Satellites and a User-friendly Religion.&quot;	2003-08-14

Other guides are more eye-popping, and more attention grabbing, but few have this level of detail and quality.<br />This small, compact guide's sole focus is Nara City, and the Shrines and Temples that make up the majority of its wonders.  Offering eight tours,  the guide is easy to follow and includes maps and major landmarks to help you find your way.  It is best used if read in advance, to better appreciate the ancient treasures that you will be seeing, and to give a more thorough understanding of Buddhist culture during the Nara period.<br />The real limitation of the guide is that it is ONLY Nara city, and leaves out the other important sites of Nara prefecture, such as Muro-ji, O-Miwa-Jinja or Hase-derra.  The guide is also only historic, and does not offer food or housing tips, or event guides.<br />The eight tours are:<br />1. Along Noborioji - The old road leading from the train station to Nara Park.<br />2. Todai-ji - The largest wooden structure in the world, housing to the Great Buddha of Nara.<br />3. Kofuku-ji and Kasuga Grand Shrine - The most important Shinto shrine in Nara.<br />4. Yakushi-ji, Toshodai-ji and Daian-ji - Competing temples of Todai-ji.<br />5.

Even during his time (1890-1904) the rules were changing and the gardner was putting away his shears, and chaos was beginning to reclaim the tree.<br />However, to understand this strange plant, with the roots and bends and twists of Bonsai sculpting, one must look at its past, and the methods of shaping.  From Hearn's point of view, this shaping is religion, specifically Ancestor worship and the &quot;rule of the dead.&quot;  Without insight into Japanese religious history and practices, Hearn says, you cannot understand Japan, its history or its people.<br />&quot;Japan: An attempt at interpretation&quot; is incredibly insightful and thorough, offering a history of the various forms of Shinto, Buddhism, Confucianism and other folk-practices that shaped the national character.  I am currently working on my MA in Japanese Religion, and I can verify that his research is correct, and his conclusions still hold.  It is the longest of Hearn's books, and obviously a great deal of work went into it.<br />All though time has passed him by, &quot;Japan: An Attempt at Interpretation&quot; is still a valid, interesting book, both well-written and accurate.  It DOES help explain Japanese interactions and culture.  Most interesting are his speculations of Japanese culture, and where it would go in his pre-WWII era.

He speaks fondly of the &quot;literati&quot; of old Japan, a group of well-off leisure class who whistled their days away creating art and appreciating beauty, free of toil or earthly constraints.  Oxford and Yale educated, coming from money, Kerr firmly sees himself as the last vanguard of the literati, and his lifestyle is leaving him.  The lifestyle of the educated elite.<br />Composed of a series of unrelated articles, the book tells the tale of Kerr's life, of things that happen to capture his fancy, and of the intersecting lives of wealthy art dealers, artists and artisans.  Everyone in the book is a genius.  Everyone, the last embodiment of their vanishing breed.  The world has become too cold to appreciate them. This is the Japan that is lost.<br />The book is incredibly well-written, and Kerr sees with the eyes of an artist.  He has insights into parts of Japanese culture that would normally be closed, such as the back stage scene of Kabuki theater.  His writing is strong enough to make you long for that vanishing Japan.  Secret places and unappreciated nooks will appear as interesting as the most famous temple in Kyoto.<br />Worth reading and enjoyable, but ultimately a grain of salt is needed.  Kerr's elitism leaves him blind to anything modern, any new artistic innovation or art form.  He sees only the past, and wants to capture Japan like a photograph, and preserve it forever.	2003-07-29

All of the stories are fairly short, and reflect Hearn's love of folk magic, ghosts and moonlight themes.<br />The book is broken into three section.  Strange Stories are all short fiction ghost tales.  Folklore Gleanings is made up of scientific observations and reports, and Studies Here and There collects some interesting non-fiction tales of death and Buddhist rites.<br />Strange Stories - &quot;Of a Promise Kept&quot; is a honest, honorable Samurai ghost story.  &quot;Of a Promise Broken&quot; is the opposite, an eerie tale of Samurai dishonor.  &quot;Before the Supreme Court,&quot; &quot;The Story of Kogi the Priest&quot; and &quot;The Story of Kwashin Koji&quot; are Buddhist folk tales full or morality and magic.  &quot;The Story of Umetsu Chubei&quot; is a Samurai tale of heritage and strength.<br />Folklore Gleanings - &quot;Dragon Flies&quot; is an in-depth article on Dragon Flies, including drawings, myths and a collection of translated haikus.  It is one of the longer pieces in the book.  &quot;Buddhist Names of Plants and Animals&quot; is just that, showing the Buddhist origins of the names of several species.  &quot;Songs of Japanese Children&quot; is also self-explanatory and is the longest article.<br />Studies Here and There - &quot;On a Bridge&quot; is a short bit of non-fiction about Samurai and peasants.  &quot;The Case of O-Dai&quot; is a sad tale of early Christian missionaries, and their lack of respect for the native culture leading to one woman's destruction.  &quot;Beside the Sea&quot; tells of a Buddhist ocean ritual for drowned sailors.  &quot;Drifting&quot; is the story of a typhoon, and a brush with death.  &quot;Otokichi's Daruma&quot; talks about the Daruma, a tiny Buddhist god of luck.	2003-07-27

They are all fine examples of the Good Captain, showing his charm and appeal.  The printing quality is excellent, and the stories have never looked better.<br />Keep 'em coming DC!  A great book, and I am looking forward to &quot;Shazam Archives vol. 4.&quot;	2003-07-02

It is packed with interesting, relevant annotations about the world of Anne of Green Gables, as well as LM Montgomery's own life and Prince Edward Island itself.<br />Due to the nature of the writing in Anne of Green Gables, an annotated edition is especially welcome to fill in the blanks on Canadian politics (What is a &quot;grit?&quot;) and social conventions at the time.  Reading the annotations increases the pleasure of entering the Anne's world, and that is incredibly important.<br />Also, of special note and appreciation, many of Anne's favorite obscure poems and readers are included in the back.  Finally, you are able to get the whole version of the many quotes that she drops, and see just where she picked up her big words.<br />The best gift you could get for a true fan of Anne of Green Gables.	2003-05-18

The compact size makes it easy to carry around, and a whole lot of kanji are packed inside.  The strokes are easily defined, and the unusual use of pen rather than calligraphy is appreciated.<br />However, the book has some serious faults.  First it is definitely not a &quot;kanji learner.&quot;  There is no workbook-style layout to trace the kanji stroke by stroke before writing alone.  The strokes are outlined, but there is no room for practice.  Second, aside from kanji, the book is almost entirely written in romaji, which is no help to learning Japanese and makes for more difficult searching of individual kanji.  Third, there is no insight into kanji, no presentation of radicals, or anything to help a learner understand kanji.  It presents each kanji as an individual character to be memorized.<br />I would never recommend this as a sole kanji book, but it serves its purpose for reference and is a good tool overall.	2003-05-18

It IS a textbook, so anyone expecting an insightful or interesting read is going to be disappointed.<br />There is very little depth of coverage, and the book exists as a roughshod &quot;bringing you up to view&quot; on Japan since 1945.  Economy, history, population, social conventions...all of these are touched on in brief as well as most major topics of interest including the formation of the major political parties, the elections and resignations of Prime Ministers and the formation and influence of the yakuza.<br />A very thin and easily portable book, I am glad to have read it before beginning a more detailed study of Japan.	2003-05-18

More than anything, I find him to be a master of creating a dreamlike atmosphere, where the strangest things become familiar, and sometimes crawling to the bottom of a well is the only thing that makes sense.  Again, I am reminded of Neil Gaimen's comic \\"The Sandman,\\" where average people encounter the surreal and magical with acceptance and without shock, when the mood is just right, the moon is in the sky and the cats know all of the secrets of the world.<br />\\"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle\\" is an excellent novel.  It is not captivating or demanding or any aggressive adjective.  It is complicatedly simple in theme and wording, eluding to an ocean of depth under the calm surface.  Pain and joy are told in the same objective manner, from the point of view of a silent observer.  Japan's aggression in WWII,  marital fidelity, ..., love, nature...all of these hard subjects are exhumed, examined, and reflected upon in silent self-examination.<br />This is not a book of resolutions, of tied-up plots and answers.  Like most things mysterious, it is all the  better for the final veil never being lifted.	2003-04-26

The message is not an easy one to decipher, which is proper considering the complexity of the issue.  There are layers here.<br />The art is, of course, incredible, as one comes to expect from Alex Ross.  He has really outdone himself, and this is obviously a labor of love that goes above and beyond his fanboy's love of comics.  He uses a variety of artistic influences and imagery.  Like the storyline itself, a deeper knowledge of American art history aids the appreciation.<br />This book combines everything that is unique and relevant about the medium of comics.  Words and pictures together, telling a story in a way impossible to either alone.	2003-04-11

The tool that helps the novel keep its balance, its umbrella if you will, is Ishiguro's writing ability and use of language.  His skill is what keeps you turning the pages, even while the plot makes you want to hurl the thing against the wall.<br />For a work with a detective as the main character, there is no detecting.  All cerebral inquiries take place off-stage,  and are only mentioned after the fact.  Even with the device of the unreliable narrator,  some inkling of detective fiction would have been helpful.  One gets the feeling that Ishiguro lacks the skills necessary to accurately portray a detective in action, so he covers this by having it all happen elsewhen.  Many other things, relationships, chance meetings, character introductions, all seem like the plot-devices they are.  Much of it is too forced, too false.  There is little internal logic.  Plots are left dangling, such as Mei Lin.<br />With that criticism, &quot;When We Were Orphans&quot; still has some power in it, and can deliver a few gripping scenes and summon up some depth of feeling.  The war zone of Shanghai is one.  The revelations of Uncle Philip are stunning in their strength.  Some of the characters live and breath,  such as Jennifer, even while interacting with the cardboard cut-outs that stand for other characters, such as Akira.  Read as a series of short stories, interlinked with a wandering narrative, it is a decent book.	2003-04-04

Anyone who enjoys the wierd fiction/folklore horror genre will enjoy Hellboy.<br />\\"Conqueror Worm\\" has all of the elements of a great Hellboy story.  Mystical Nazi's seek to contact things from \\"beyond,\\" who wait for mankind's destruction.  If this sounds familiar, then you will probably like Hellboy.  Newer characters, in the form of Roger the Homunculus and Lobster Johnston are developed, and become an interesting part of the Hellboy mythos rather than side players.<br />The art is amazing, as usual.  Magnolia refines his style with each Hellboy release.  As always, the TPB offers new material and is superior to the monthly comic release.  The entire Hellboy library is as worth owning as the complete works of Poe or Lovecraft.  \\"Conqueror Worm\\" is a necessary edition.	2003-03-27

It is just like learning the Alphabet.  The more difficult Kanji comes only after mastering the two basic writing systems.  All quality Japanese books will use a kana base, rather than a romaji (English writing of Japanese) base.<br />Kana learning is incredibly simple, and is basically learning the strokes, then getting a good workbook for practice.  I found the &quot;Beginner's Kana Workbook&quot; to be an excellent tool in kana acquisition, with appropriate exercises for both writing forms.  Also, hiragana and katakana are combined in one book, as they should be, for a good price.	2003-03-26

There will be more Murakami in my future.<br />The book reads like the few moments of unreality before settling into sleep.  Like something from the comic book &quot;The Sandman,&quot; this is a story of dreams, moons, love and cats.<br />With the title &quot;Sputnik Sweetheart,&quot; I was expecting some sort of hard-metal story, where love shatters on technology or maybe something about the fast pace of modern life in Japan.  I certainly wasn't expecting this gentle, silent love short story, told to the sound of Brahms and with the flavor of French wines.<br />Of course, the style of writing and the ideas are the forefront of the novel, with the actual plot taking a supporting role.  The characters are wholly unrealized, mere glimpses of caricatures.  They love, they live and they do so poetically.  They have ideas, and those ideas are worked out in the medium of the written word. Minimalist seems to be thrown around, and maybe that is so, but I don't see it.  The words flow, and hold together well.  The plot is fleeting, an altogether unresolved, the the half-memory of a dream that made sense at the time, but seems strange in the re-telling.<br />An excellent book, one best read right before bedtime.	2003-03-15

First off, the title is wrong, and has little to do with the book (It should have been called \\"Munn's World.\\")  Second, the cover art is embarrassingly bad, and screams cheap and pandering with every airbrushed inch.  It is the kind of cover and title you don't want people to see you holding on your lunch break. Third, the first chapter is so awful that it seems like it was written by a different author. It is cheap and pandering, just like the cover leads you to expect.  In short, the very things that are supposed to hook you into a new book,  repulse you instead.  I can imagine more than one person picking this book up, shaking their head at the cover, then setting it back  on the shelf after a glance at the first chapter.<br />If you can make it past these three considerable barricades, however, you are in for a completely unexpected treat.  This is a good book!  The writing style is excellent, and the writer does an amazing job of bringing to life two such disparate worlds, that of his cyberpunk pseudo-future and the VR historical world of 1800's New York.  Both worlds are fully fleshed out, with a detail that surprises even the characters in the book.  The characters are also complete, although Alex Munn tends to be the single loud voice in the book.  His supporting characters are equally interesting, and well researched.  The punk-obsessed Zeng is accurate, although there are a few minor flaws (Sid Vicious did not sing \\"God Save the Queen.\\" Johnny Rotten did.)  The mysterious villain, The Fishman, is a nice boogie man to chase Munn down his various roads.<br />Altogether, a book worth the time.  Some good ideas and good writing, with an unusually successful blending of science fiction and historical fiction.  I would love to see \\"The Shift\\" reissued with a different title and cover.  Don't give up after the first chapter!	2003-03-08

Like any proper rouge, Black Jack lives outside the rules of society, sweeping in when his skills are needed and making the corrupt pay for their mis-deeds.  Hey, he even wears a cape.<br />Each story manages to set up a situation where a super surgeon is necessary.  However, due to Tezuka's fine writing skills, there is a humanist element to each tale, that is often melancholy.  Black Jack makes other's happy, but he is rarely happy himself.  He cannot taste the forbidden fruit that is peace of mind.  Life, death, failure, lost love, childhood and age, these are all the themes presented here.  Each story is some sort of morality tale, so the logistics behind the melodrama are not as important.<br />Tezuka's cartoony style can be off-putting to those who are used to more refined Japanese manga artists, but it soon flows into the story and is admired rather than questioned.  Those already familiar with Tezuka will find the art here as fine as anything done by the \\"God of Manga.\\"<br />All in all, a really excellent comic.  Give it a chance, and you won't be disappointed.	2003-03-04

The writing is vital and captivating, as with all of his wonderful books.<br />Most interesting, I feel, to David Copperfield, is the bad choices that good people can make, and how they live with the repercussions of those choices.  Represented by Little Emily's misfortune, and David Copperfield's own woeful marriage, as well as his aunt's various misjudgments and errors.  Some deal with these bad choices honorably, some woefully, some disastrously.  We all make mistakes, the book says, but it is how we deal with these mistakes that define us.<br /> The book travels from the high to the low and back again of the British class system, although not necessarily a critique of it., with David Copperfield being able to flow through each social structure at one time or another.  A full picture is gained. There are heroes and villains alike amongst the most-very humble and the most-very rich.  Fortunes rise and fall, loves are won and lost, people live and die, all under the deft pen of Dickens, with his ability to wring both laughter and tears from a reader.  (A clich&eacute;, I know, yet a true one.)	2003-02-21

There is no substitute for technology when it comes to number of words, convenience and portability.  Of course, good electronic dictionaries are very expensive and quite a commitment.<br />This little fellow is a handy, portable Japanese-English/ English-Japanese dictionary, good for both studying and having around town when you need to look up a word.  Because of its portability, it  packs a small punch in terms of number of words, and will not be as useful as a larger desk reference.<br />On the good side, the dictionary makes good use of kana and does not present words in romajii.  Learning the kana is essential to learning Japanese, and using this dictionary will increase your reading speed.<br />A nice, compact reference to carry around, or take to a coffee shop for study.

This is no dry musty tome, but a vital novel that arouses both passion and intellect.  A literal page turner, I found myself having more than one sleepless night when I just couldn't put it down.<br />Inside are some of the major characters in the realm of fiction; Fagin and his gang of child thieves, including the Artful Dodger.  Nancy, the proverbial hooker with a heart of gold.  Master Charles Bates (was this a pun even then?)  Bad Bill Sikes, who shows the darker edge to all of this dangerous fun, and the innocent, pure Oliver Twist, who is the very definition of nature over nurture.<br />A great book, and one that I am glad to have finally read.	2003-01-28

It is too large to be easily portable, and so is more of a desk reference than an on-the-move book.<br />The only drawback is that the Japanese/English portion of the book catalogs words using romajii, instead of hiragana or katakana.  The overall impact on this is laziness to those trying to learn Japanese.  Gaining speed in kana is essential, and using a romanized dictionary will not help progress.  The kanji is available for Japanese words, but are usually of small type.	2003-01-25

Pace is something in common with all of the selections, with none of the characters getting very excited or overwrought, even in the midst of a fight or falling in love.  &quot;The Big Easy,&quot; they call it, and I believe it from these tales.  They are small, psychological portraits, well written and engaging.<br />&quot;Desirees Baby&quot; was an almost Lovecraftian psychological horror tale, of hidden ancestries creeping unwanted across generations. &quot;The Dream of an Hour&quot; is in a similar vein, with a twist ending.  Most of the stories are gentle, understated love stories both romantic (&quot;A Night in Acadie&quot;) sad (&quot;At the Cadian Ball,&quot; &quot;Azelie,&quot;), forbidden (&quot;A Respectable Woman&quot;) and funny (&quot;Madame  Celestins Divorce.&quot;)  I must admit to being charmed by each love story, and hoped the best for everyone involved.  &quot;A Pair of Silk Stockings&quot; and &quot;A Gentleman of the Bayou Teche&quot; are both brief glimpses into a small world, and equally good.<br />I am glad to be introduced to Kate Chopin, and look forward to seeking out &quot;The Awakening.&quot;	2003-01-25

The premise, a tough, go-nowhere 22 year old bosozoku deciding to become a High School teacher in order to pick up girls, at first seems like a recipe for fan service and lewd humor.  And it is.  However, like the best of Japanese comics, this rather sketchy plot develops into something a little more personal and respectable.  Onizuka, as he can relate to his pupils and is a tough guy in his own right, becomes \\"Great Teacher Onizuka.\\"<br />The art is great, and flows easily between two distinct styles, a classic Japanese cartoon style and a more expressive, violent style in some parts.  The characters are fun and multi-dimensional.  I can see why this series is so popular in Japan.<br />Also, this is a comic where my experience teaching in the Japanese school system has richened the outcome.  I \\"get\\" several of the jokes that I might have missed before, and I recognize the stereotypes.  Good fun all around, and I will definitely be picking up the rest of the series.	2003-01-25

It offers us a brief window into a part of the world, and a style of life, of which we will never be able to encounter first hand.  It allows to walk a few steps in the shoes of a different kind of citizen of life, and thus empathize with their experience.  It also provides a moving allegory for the power of fiction, and lets us appreciate something that is so readily available to us, yet so rare for others.  The escape of fiction allows for dreams, and is a powerful force.<br />Being almost ignorant of the Chinese cultural re-education system, this book was educational historically as well.  I had known of it in theory, but not details such as the banning of all books other than those written by Mao, or the process behind re-education.  I do want to learn more about this chapter in history, of which the world is still feeling the repercussions.<br />The book itself is gentle, with moving imagery and a quiet sense of humor.  The characters in it do not rage against the political machine, but instead make do with what life has forced upon them.  There is love, of  course, because humans will love in the most desperate of circumstances.  To highlight the playfulness of the book, my favorite scene is when the tailor, influenced by the hearing of Count of Monte Cristo, begins to dress the village in fanciful pirate clothes and nautical emblems.<br />Charming all the way through, and small enough to be a quick read.	2003-01-25

My second Nick Hornsby book went down as smooth as the first (&quot;About a Boy.&quot;)  Slick and Funny, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is another easy tome of manly coolness and the deep mysteries of relating to women as an adult, instead of as a kid on the playground.  The writing style is sharp and the book flies by, clocking in at a few days read at the most.<br />Hornsby does a great job of capturing the strange realm of the &quot;collector,&quot; and of understanding that mode of life.  As the owner of a comic book store for a few years, I could relate to Rob's daily woes and the misfits that one can find oneself surrounded by.  The music makes for some nice interludes in the storyline.  The characters are not altogether likeable, but they do grow on you.<br />Like his other book I have read, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is not exactly deep or thought-provoking, but it is fun.

A new vocabulary is introduced to the reader, along with a host of new ideas about time, including &quot;event time,&quot; &quot;natural time,&quot; and the familiar &quot;clock time.&quot;  The author's research is enlightening and challenging.<br />The concepts are easy to absorb, and the subject is well-researched and documented.  I have no doubt that Levine's work is strong.  Some of the work involves providing evidence for well-known concepts, such as bigger cities have a faster pace than smaller cities.  Interesting correlations are drawn between the pace of a location and the accuracy of it's timepieces.  I found the concept of being able to train oneself  to elongate and condense time perception to be particularly interesting, such as in the case of a martial artist who moves fast by forcing an opponent to appear to move slow.  Other interesting tidbits include the &quot;contradiction of Japan,&quot; which shows that an ultra-fast paced life can be balanced out with cultural rules to prevent aggression, and how a slow-paced city is not necessarily kinder than a fast-paced city.<br />The reason why &quot;A Geography of Time&quot; is only almost-excellent is due to the author's skills as a writer.  Ideas are not presented in a structured manner, information is redundantly repeated and personal opinions are freely mixed with research and evidence.  Some difficult concepts, such as Einstein's time dilatation in Special Relativity are introduced as window dressing for what amounts to a sociological subject.  A brief history of the introduction of clocks in America is included.  The last chapter is almost a &quot;self help&quot; opinion piece by the author, on how to use knowledge of time to greatest advantage.<br />All in all, while the research is interesting and the concepts are worth reading, the book would have  benefited from a tighter focus on the author's part.  The book wander's lazily from concept to concept, and hurts the material overall.  All in all, worth reading and enjoyable, but falling just short of the mark.benefited from a tighter focus on the author's part.

Weighing in at around 80% dialog, the book was consumed over the course a few meager train rides.  This is an ultimate popcorn book.  Page after page flows through your hands, never really engaging your thinking brain but fully engaging your  wit.<br /> The characters were smooth and the dialog was dry and clever.  There is a rough plot, just barely enough to string together a cast of characters and to give them something to quip about.  Alot of the drama, is seemingly heavy, but seen through the eyes of the characters it soon descends into just another bit of life about which to make smart remarks.  The teen angst has all the power of any teen angst, and remains just that.<br />This is my first Nick Hornsby book, although there will be others.  Lots of fun all around.  A nice break between more weighty books, and there is nothing wrong with that at all.	2002-12-08

Much like the code of Chivalry of European Knights (of which the book makes comparisons), Bu-shi-do (Military - Knight - Way) lays down stringent rules of behavior towards superiors and inferiors, of behavior in battle and in peace, as well as the minute of life, all as a way of taming and ordering this privileged warrior class which sprang from the most brutish, most barbarian roots.<br />Written in 1900, the book uses the writing style common at the times.  \\"Bushido\\" was written as a means to educate an educated Western audience about the soul of Japan and eliminate common prejudices towards the Japanese civilization.  As Nitobe writes for a 1900s Western educated audience, he takes it for granted that the reader is familiar with Shakespeare and often uses Shakespearian characters as mouthpieces for the Western point of view.  \\"As Iago said....\\"<br />Nitobe does an excellent job explaining the code, and uses fables and examples to illustrate his points.  He clearly sees the value in this military way of life, and waxes poetic from time to time.  There are no insights into modern Japan to be gained from \\"Bushido,\\" anymore than you can understand modern London by reading \\"Le Mort D'Arthur.\\"  It is, however, a great resource for understanding historic Japan and the Samurai cast.	2002-12-05

This is nothing more or less than a small, pocket-book sized grammar text for using Japanese verbs.  &quot;Te&quot; forms, &quot;tara&quot; forms, &quot;hoshii&quot; forms are all covered, along with pretty much every other possible conjugation.  This is no dictionary, however, so do not expect to learn any new words.  Just expect to make better use of the verbs you already know.<br />The sections are broken down well, and there are very small practice sections at the end of each chapter.  For what it is, it is an excellent resource.  I would recommend this book to serious, college level learners of Japanese.	2002-11-25

As a lifelong comic book devotee, especially of the Golden Age of comics, I caught every reference and knew every allusion Michael Chabon was making.  I know what artists Joe Kavelier is an amalgamation of, and I know who Samuel Klayman and Rosa Saks are (at least in the comic book world.)  I know what the cover of Amazing Midget Radion Comics #1 looks like, because I have seen the original from which it was taken. (Captain America Comics #1, for anyone who wants to look it up.)<br />The story is a delight, well written and as bursting with energy and excitement as the original comics themselves.  It does not dwell on the minute of this peculiar art form, but drops enough hints so that an informed reader knows that Michael Chabon knows what he is talking about.  (Kavelier sails to the Antarctic aboard the US Miskatonic!)<br />My knowledge of magic and escapistry is more than limited, but I am sure a seasoned magician will get the same delight from &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Kavelier and Clay.&quot;  I trust that the reseach is accurate, and that Chabon has given me a glimpse into more than one secret world.<br />A really, truly great book.	2002-11-25

Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read.<br />Jane Austen proves that brevity is not the soul of wit.  Here razor-sharp pen peels back the outward polish and fine veneer of a host of stuffed shirts.  Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy live and breath, and I am addicted to their story even though I know the outcome.  Plot is not the reason to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; rather it is just to take pleasure in good writing and cheer.<br />After this book, I am diving headfirst into the world of Jane Austen.  Amazing that it took me this long to discover her.	2002-11-11

In fact, Nausicaa, while good, had never been amongst my favorite Miyazaki films.<br />Now that I have read the first volume of the Nausicaa comic, I am a full blown Nausicaa junky.  Wow!  This is such an amazing comic!  There is so much more room to flesh out the characters and the plots of the film.  There is a lot going on here, and some tough issues are being tackled.  The comic is intelligent and yet captivating and entertaining.  A rare achievement in comics.<br />Miyazaki is one of the master storytellers of all times, and this series may be one of his crowning achievements.  I am sure the remaining volumes will live up to my now-high expectations.<br />I wish I knew a young girl that I could pass down &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&quot; too.  I think it is one of those books that could make quite an impression on a young persons life.  It sure made an impression on this adult.	2002-11-02

The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...<br />Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.<br />While not as charming as Austin's other books, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.<br />By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread.	2002-10-26

With \\"The Tin Princess,\\"  Mrs. Goldberg disappears almost altogether, and Jim takes the stage along with the long lost Adelaide and newcomer Becky.<br />Set in a minor European kingdom, the action of this story takes place both in the palace and the bar.  Jim travels in the seedy underbelly, while Queen Adelaide takes on the court.  Intrigue, plots, romance and history are all present in droves, as one has come to expect from Pullmans Lockhart books.<br />A few of the plot points seem more convenient than natural.  Jim's sudden overwhelming love for Adelaide does not suit the Jim that I am familiar with.  It does,  however, work for the story once it has been accepted.  It is nice to reunite with Adelaide, although I always enjoyed her disappearance at the end of \\"Ruby in the Smoke.\\"  I saw it as Mr. Pullman's way of saying that not everything turns out well, and not all mysteries are solved.  But her she is.<br />\\"The Tin Princess\\" is not the strongest book to come out of Phillip Pullman, but the nostalgia for the characters and his enjoyable writing is enough to make it a good book, and one worth reading.	2002-10-26

It is both fun and insightful.  The layout of the book makes for easy reading, and the pictures are amusing and informative.<br />Idioms are an important part of any language.  Without them, you will not be able to understand most conversations, and people will need to adopt an unnatural speech pattern to communicate with you.  It is interesting how many idioms are shared between languages, just using different examples. (Such as: Japanese - Three people together have the wisdom of Buddha.  English - Two heads are better than one.)<br />Along with the useful conversational phrases, &quot;101 Japanese Idioms&quot; also provides a valuable insight into Japanese culture and values.  What do Japanese people thing is important?  What do they mock?<br />A small warning.  Like most idioms, these are somewhat advanced Japanese and not suitable for beginners.  A learner should have a pretty solid foundation in basics before attempting to use any of these idioms.  However, a beginner should enjoy the book for it's cultural insights.  All around, a good addition to any Japanese curriculum.	2002-10-08

There is a true story of an accurate fortune teller know to the author, in &quot;A Story of Divination.&quot;   &quot;Bits of Poetry&quot; and &quot;Japanese Buddhist Proverbs&quot; translates and teaches several bits of Japanese lore as they relate to the world of the dead.  <br />Some essays, such as &quot;Silkworms,&quot; are pure conjecture, relating the human ideals of paradise to the daily lives of silkworms.  &quot;Suggestion&quot; is a conversation between the author and a monk on the nature of gender and re-birth in the Buddhist tradition.<br />Of true ghost stories, there are few.  Many of the ghost stories, such as &quot;Furisode,&quot; begin with a short lesson about something Japanese, in this case a long-sleeved Kimono known as a Furisode, and then relates a ghost story dealing with the object.  Some, such as &quot;Ingwa-banashi,&quot; are pure chilling horror that make you cringe.  Other true ghost stories in this collection are &quot;Story of a Tengu,&quot; &quot;Ululation,&quot; &quot;Fragment&quot; and &quot;A Passional Karma.&quot;  <br />One of my favorites, a short story called &quot;At Yaidzu,&quot; tells of the author swimming out amongst the Obon lanterns, which are put to see to guide home the spirits of the dead, and the feeling he gets being in the Ocean amongst the returning dead.  Truly creepy.<br />All in all, &quot;In Ghostly Japan&quot; is a bit more scholarly than ghastly.   The writing style is like many books from the 1880's, a bit dry and non-thrilling. It is a good resource for learning about the Ghostly traditions of Japan, but those seeking a collection ofJapanese ghost stories will be disappointed.	2002-09-29

Iron!"	\\"Hellboy: The Chained Coffin and Others\\" is my favorite Hellboy compilation.  As shown by HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe, the short story works well for horror. This book is a collection of Hellboy short stories.<br />Each story has roots in traditional fairy mythology combined with Lovecraftian overtones and just a splash of Nazi occultism.  Magnolia has given his character Hellboy a very dry sense of humor, which works well in contrast to the talking corpses and various devils.  The art is some of the finest seen in comics.<br />\\"The Corpse\\" and  \\"The Iron Shoes\\" is a short fairy stories.  Clever and fun with a nice nod to Celtic mythology.<br /> \\"Christmas Underground\\" highlights Magnolia's wit.<br /> \\"The Chained Coffin\\" is one of the best in the collection, showing the folly of loving the devil.  It has some of the best dialog. \\"God?  Was not I God in ancient Babylon?\\"<br />\\"The Baba Yaga\\" Always nice to see this ancient evil.  Only available in this collection.<br />\\"Wolves of Saint August\\" is a werewolf tale, with a twist.

Sally Lockhart is not a perfect hero.  She has faults like any person and often is blinded by her ambition to prove herself.  She goes through many changes in this book and matures into a young woman.  No longer a teenager, Sally is in her twenties in \\"The Shadow in the North.\\"  Fred Garland and Jim are there to help her as usual.<br />I don't want to give away too much about the book.  It is a mystery after all!  But I will say that, like many Philip Pullman books, \\"The Shadow in the North\\" is bitter-sweet and captivating.  Sometimes reality intrudes too much into the fantasy, leaving a strange sensation for the reader.  A very good novel.	2002-09-24

Every Japanese learner struggles with particles.  Organizing particles is one of the most difficult part of the language, and there are few good resources to help you out.  &quot;All About Particles:  A Handbook of Japanese Function Words&quot; is the single most useful book I have found on the topic.<br />This is a true reference book.  Although it can be read straight through (and I recommend this at least once), it is most useful for looking up difficult particles as you discover them.  Placing them in context will help the learning process.  Read all in one sitting it is a little overwhelming, but good for an overview of all 70 plus particles.<br />One of the advantages of &quot;All About Particles&quot; is that the examples use various forms of politeness.  It also demonstrates interchangeable particles, and which expressions are more daily-use.  The text itself is very compact, and travels well.<br />I would recommend this book to any Japanese learner looking to bridge the gap from Advanced Beginner to Intermediate.	2002-09-18

I am glad that Philip Harper wrote \\"The Insider's Guide to Sake.\\"  What you have here in this little book is everything a person needs to begin their exploration into the inscrutable world of Sake.<br />Like many alcohols, Sake is a beverage of wildly variant qualities.  Some is made to be cheap and get you drunk quick, some is made to savor and enjoy.  Of course, approaching a Sake label with little Japanese ability makes it difficult to discern the difference.  Even if the label is translated, the meaning is not readily clear.  What makes a good Sake?  What qualities should I be looking for?<br />This books takes that exact frame of mind, leading the novice through all stages of Sake production from rice growing to brewing methods, both traditional and modern.  Sake is quality-graded by the government, and by the end of this book a drinker will be able to choose with confidence between a Junmaishu, a Hinjozu or the ultra-sake Daiginjo.<br />A few other benefits of this guide are a sake alphabet, with facts and useful tidbits of information spread throughout the book in alphabet format.  The tasting guide offers a brief glance at a hundred or so of the available 1,000 plus Sakes.  I found this to be a very useful starting place, allowing me to make an informed choice at the Sake store.  (The book also shows you how to recognize a quality Sake seller.  a very useful piece of information.)  Depending on where you live, the sake restaurant guide is useful.<br />All in all, this book picked my interest in sake and transformed my casual curiosity into a full-blown investigation.  Don't go into a sake shop without it!	2002-09-12

I found Sally Lockhart.<br />\\"Ruby in the Smoke\\" is a very different style of book.  There is no fantasy in this series, no armored bears or magical implements.  This is straight historical mystery, set in England of 1872.  Sally Lockhart is our young hero.  She is an amazingly well-rounded character, at times a plucky, spirited lass, at times a shy young woman.  She is looking for facts about the death or her Father.  Someone else is looking for her, and her connection to the lost Ruby of Agrapar.<br />While this book does not have the sense of wonder and captivation of \\"His Dark Materials,\\" it does posses it's own strengths.  Pullman has gone very deep into accuracy and social relevance with this trilogy.  The story is as much Sally Lockhart's battle with women's conventions of the time, as it is with the villains of the series.  The story is very dark, and the opium trade and the Indian Mutiny are all major story  points. (In fact, anyone taking up \\"Ruby in the Smoke\\" would do well to review this historical events.)<br />A very good, intelligent book.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.	2002-07-10

It can also mean the utter loss of the soul, or of final happiness in a future state.  Here, Perdition is the name of a small town where sanctuary and salvation lie for a young boy and his father.<br />This comic is part tragedy/part action-flick/part morality play, with each part blending into a complex whole.  Historical figures, such as Frank Nitty, Al Capone and Eliot Ness hold the stage with the semi-fictional O'Sullivan family.  It is Chicago in the 1930's, a time as operatic as the English middle ages with Knights and Castles, or the Tokugawa era of Japan where \\"Road to Perdition's\\" ancestor \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\" is set.  Trench coats and Tommy-guns play the part of swords and armor, with equal splendor and symbolism.<br />The art is splendidly realistic and well-crafted.  The realism of the art allows for non-comic readers to instantly enter the story.  The comic is black and white, like the characters within.  The format is pocket-book sized and is easily portable.  The author includes a nice forward, explaining the stories origins and historical setting.<br />\\"Road to Perdition\\" is a great read.  I am not generally a huge fan of historical fiction, or of crime fiction, but this one won me over.	2002-07-08

Not being a huge fan of crime-fiction myself, I gave it a try based on Bendis's excellent work on the comic series &quot;Powers.&quot;  Also, I liked the idea of a real-life &quot;super-hero&quot; in Eliot Ness pitched against a real-life &quot;super-villain&quot; in the form of the Torso serial killer.<br />Like Alan Moore's &quot;From Hell,&quot; Bendis took a real, unresolved case and weaved a drama around facts.  His story-telling is realistic and gritty, and does not contain Moore's flights of fancy. I would have liked to have seen an appendix, separating the drama from the known facts, and why Bendis choose his particular culprit.<br />The art is not a strong initial attractor, but after reading a few pages it starts to flow.  The mix of photos and drawings is effective.<br />This is really strong stuff, and I recommend it to comic fans and crime-fiction fans alike.	2002-07-08

The focus of the book is on Nara City, rather than Nara Prefecture.<br />The photographs are nice, although nothing particularly unique.  Close-up shots of flowers, long shots of sweeping terrain, the burning fields, the lanterns, the deer, and of course, the enormous Great Buddha.  This is not a photo-journalist's guide to Nara, but instead a photo-romanticist's guide.<br />The writing ranges from pithy and interesting, to as frothy and decorative as the photos.  Nara City is an important piece of Japanese history, and this is represented through eyewitness accounts from across the centuries, and delicate Haikus.  Rudyard Kipling is one of the featured writers.<br />All in all, &quot;Nara Encounters&quot; is a nice book, short on depth and thin in length.  It takes the view that Nara is a fairy-tale land of Castles, deer and flowers, with no actual people living in the City.	2002-06-04

This book is even more relevant, now that the Rankin/Bass filmography is being released on DVD.  It will make you chomp at the bit for each new release.<br />If Peter Cottontail, The Snow Miser and Heat Miser, Frosty the Snowman and Happy the Christmas Baby (&quot;those ears!&quot;) ring any bells for you, then you will enjoy &quot;The Enchanted World of Rankin/Bass.&quot;	2002-06-04

And not just the \\"classic\\" classics, mind you, but some rather obscure works indeed, classic for their quality instead of their familiarity.  Do you know the illustrated verses of Randolph Caldecott?  How about Arthur Ransome's \\"Swallows and Amazons\\" or Kipling's \\"Puck of Pook's Hill?\\"<br />I found that my interest waxed and waned along with my familiarity.  I was thrilled to go to Tintagel and Sherwood Forest in search of King Arthur and Robin Hood.  I delighted to visit with Mrs. Millne in the Hundred Acre Wood of Winnie the Pooh.  Toad Hall and Rat's Riverbank are well-traveled terrain.  Less so are the lands of The Borrower's, or the Gypsy Caravans or Pook's Hill.  (I winced when they drove past Anlwick Castle without stoping.  They missed out on quite an experience.)<br />The writing is very much like that of a person keeping a journal.  Details do not fit into a story, and the narrative drifts along with the same randomness of the family.  The only voice is Joan Bodger's, and her husband and children are foils for her to act upon.<br />All in all, it is a very pleasant little book that I enjoyed reading.  I know I would have enjoyed it more if I had a library of British children's literature to browse through for familiarity.	2002-05-31

They would have a hard time weaving a story with a barrier in the way.<br />However, screens have their uses, mainly as a quick reference for charts and as a means of hiding maps and dice rolls.  The &quot;Call of Cthulhu Keeper's Screen&quot; does the job just fine, and organizes the charts in a logical manner.  The artwork on the front is not great, and could use improvement.  It can be distracting to players.<br />The main defect of this screen is the misprint where they did not add the numbers to the &quot;Strength vs. Resistance&quot; chart.  This is one of the most important charts in the game, and I am gobsmacked that such a major defect made it onto the market.<br />If you are running &quot;Call of Cthulhu,&quot; it will be useful to have a screen.  Just beware of the limitations.	2002-05-31

Superman, Batman and Wonderwoman are as much a part of Americana as Mickey Mouse, Coca-Cola and Moby Dick.  A blend of art and cheap entertainment, the comic book has evolved throughout the decades, as have the heroes within.<br />The history of this company is laid out from the beginnings of the comic book, to the debut of the long-running Action Comics (Superman) and Detective Comics (Batman).  Each of the company's successive stages is detailed, the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, and the Modern Age.  Familiar rivals, such as Plastic Man, Captain Marvel and the Charleston and Quality heros are shown.  Frank Miller and Alan Moore are given their just due.  Superheroes in film and on television are shown.<br />The pages contain great photographs and reprints of classic comic culture.  It is nice to see the classic covers of the years in high quality reproductions.  A cavalcade of toys, badges, trinkets and other tie-ins are displayed.<br />All in all, this is a great book for DC comics fans.	2002-05-30

Some of the solutions are simple, like &quot;Read Manga in Japanese,&quot; whereas others are more complicated like the idea of using synonyms when you can not remember the exact word.

Expansion books then add new elements to your main book.<br />For &quot;Call of Cthulhu,&quot; I find the &quot;The 1920S Investigator's Companion&quot; to be the only expansion I use every game.  The additional Investigator occupations add an exciting element and allow for more customization for players.  For the Keeper, the &quot;Investigator's Companion&quot; does not add any complication to game play, as many expansion and optional rule books do.<br />The book is packed with information about the 1920's, and can really fill out your campaign.  The optional character classes, such as &quot;Athlete,&quot; are adaptable to other eras.  &quot;The 1920S Investigator's Companion&quot; is a very well put-together supplement, and is easy to navigate.	2002-05-21

Howard had an interest in old Scotland,  back in the time of Hadrian's Wall when woad-decorated Pictish warriors held fast against the armor-covered legions of Rome.  In a way, it is a historic demonstration of Howard's love of the clash of primitive and civilized.  In Bran Mak Morn, he found a Scottish hero capable of rallying the primitive Picts and embodying his ideals.<br />Expect no historical accuracy here.  Howard admits openly that he took the idea of the Picts and created his own fantasy race around them.  He changed the spelling from Mac to Mak to disguise the Gaelic roots of his hero.  Howard's Picts are mediterranean in origin, brown-skinned and dark haired.  They shun armor and carry flint and bronze weapons.<br />The writing of Bran Mak Morn is not Howard's best.  His best work was reserved for Conan, created later in his career.  Still, I enjoyed every single story in this volume, with two or three stories sticking out as among the best of Howard's writing.  The often singled-out &quot;Worms of the Earth&quot; is as good as you would think.  Bran Mak Morn teams up with Kull the Conqueror in the excellent &quot;Kings of the Night.&quot;  &quot;The Children of the Night&quot; is inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's suggestion that Howard incorporate his Mythos elements into his primal yarns.<br />All around a good, solid series from Robert E. Howard.	2002-05-20

I find \\"Michael Jackson's Complete Guide to Single Malt Scotch\\" to be the most comprehensive, intelligible and above-all useful book in my whisky library.<br />While no book can take the place of sitting down and doing some tastings, buying whisky by the glass for tasting can be prohibitively expensive.  If you are buying by the bottle, it becomes an even greater investment, and figuring out your individual tastes will be a considerable investment.  Michael Jackson's guide goes a long way in the selection process, leading you to the whiskys most likely to meet your pallet.  Each whisky is outlined, explained and graded.  It will at least give you an idea of what to expect when approaching an unfamiliar label.<br />This book definitely falls into the \\"If you only own one book about single malt...\\" category.	2002-05-10

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	3	23	27	N	Y	Advice - Some good, some bad	&quot;Culture Shock - Japan&quot; is a book written during a specific time period for a specific target audience.  Realistically, this is a guide for businessmen who found themselves transferred to Japan during the &quot;Bubble Economy.&quot;  At least, the book assumes that the reader is moving to Japan semi-permanently.  The author makes it pretty clear that this is not intended to be a tourists guide.<br />With that in mind, however, you can mine some good advice from &quot;Culture Shock - Japan.&quot;  The most useful chapters focused on social customs like gift giving, house visits, riding the subway and other day-to-day encounters.  Social customs of this sort are more common, and less affected by the fading economy.  You will definitely be able to avoid some embarrassing situations if you follow the advice.  I skipped several chapters that did not relate to my situation, such as &quot;Doing Business with the Japanese,&quot; and the chapter on buying a house.<br />One the plus side, the book is a quick read (especially if you skip chapters like I did) and will help prepare you for oncoming culture shock.  It gives an important message in that Japan is going to be far more different that you expect, and that you should prepare yourself.<br />Recommended, with reservation.  If you are going to Japan for a long-term stay, I think that this is a useful book.  It just should not be your only book on Japanese culture and expectations.	2002-05-09

Howard's Conan stories, exactly as he wrote them.  Most readers (myself included) are only familiar with the edited versions of these stories made available in the Conan pocketbooks of the seventies and eighties.  The writing is lusty, bloody and vibrant.  Conan is not for the easily offended.<br />The Conan Chronicles presents the stories chronologically as seen by Conan, not as written.  Howard's first Conan story, &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; (included in the middle of this volume) already has Conan as King of Aquilonia.  In the opening story, &quot;Red Nails,&quot;  he is still a pirate on the run, adventuring with Valeria of the Red Brotherhood.  The only Conan novel, &quot;The Hour of the Dragon&quot; is also included.<br />The stories are intense and captivating.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is just about as good a writer as you are going to find, and &quot;The Supernatural Tales of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&quot; is one of the best horror books I have read.  There is an acknowledged Poe influence in this collection of 16 ghost and mystery stories, but the stories are definitely Doyle.  Several of the stories focus on the then-current vogue of Egyptology, including &quot;Lot No. 249&quot; featuring the first &quot;walking Mummy&quot; story.  Other gems include &quot;The Leather Funnel,&quot; &quot;The Ring of Thoth&quot; and Doyle's first published story, &quot;The Mystery of Sassa Valley.&quot;<br />This slim volume is a treasure-trove of wierd fiction.	2002-05-08

He has pushed the envelope, single-handedly transforming the medium from one only capable of churning out simplistic kid's fantasies into an accepted vehicle for Art (with a capitol \\"A!\\").  The comic book industries highest award, The Eisner, is named after him.  All possible accolades are piled upon Will Eisner.  Strange, then, that so few comics fans (myself included) have actually read his comics.  I decided to change that by buying this book.<br />\\"A Contract with God\\" is a deliberate attempt, the first actually, of using the combination of words and pictures to relate a story of the human condition on par with any works of great literature.  It is the first ever \\"Graphic Novel,\\" printed solely in book form and not merely a collection of serialized stories.  Eisner had lofty goals for this slim volume. Semi-autobiographical, he told stories of the Jewish slums of New York around the time of the Great Depression.  Being neither Jewish, nor from the East Coast, nor alive during the Great Depression, I was not sure how well I would relate to the book.<br />Well, because he is one of the giants, Eisner uses words and pictures to bridge the gap between his experience and mine, finding common ground and understanding.  \\"A Contract with God\\" is entertaining, addictive and enlightening.  I can honestly say that I am better for having read it.  Go ahead, give it a try.	2002-05-06

This is the Hulk taken to a more logical conclusion.  The Hulk's rampages cause more than property damage, killing thousands of people each time Bruce Banner loses control.  On his trail is Doc Sampson and the US Army, intent on ending his menace.<br />However, \\"Startling Stories: Banner\\" is not an over-the-top blood bath.  The story is psychological, dealing with the split personality of the character.  The Hulk hates Banner, as the weak thing that lives within him.  Bruce Banner feels intense guilt over the death and destruction he causes, yet he is helpless to prevent it.  Doc Sampson is charmingly full of bravado, yet sympathetic to Bruce Banner.<br />Richard Corben's stylized art is suited to the excellent writing.  His Hulk, his Doc Sampson, and his Bruce Banner are each a unique interpretation.  Corben captures the destruction and depression of the characters well.  Facial expressions are used well, as are the scale of the characters.<br />All in all, a really nice bit of comic art, perfect for those, like myself, who would like to read a well-done Hulk story without all of the baggage of the monthly series.	2002-05-06

It didn't take much for me to slip back into the world of Robert E. Howard.  I haven't read any Conan books since I was a kid (I got my first library card solely to check out Conan books!), and I picked this volume up to see if the stories held up to my memory.<br />They are so much better than I remember them.  Robert E. Howard, who I have gained new respect for, is a good writer.  This edition, for the first time, is pure Howard.  The books I read were the de Camp/Carter edited versions/pastiches, and I don't think that their watered-down versions ever had this much life in them.  They were certainly never this addictive.<br />The writing is these stories is vibrant and rough.  Pulp writing dictated a certain style of cheap thrills and excitement, and Conan has all of this.  However, the strength of craft, of use of language and story, makes these stories shine.  Howard successfully created a bold fantasy world unlike any other, although it has often been copied.  His liberal use of his friend H.P. Lovecraft's \\"outside horror\\" adds to the atmosphere of Hyborea.  Conan is a fully-realised character, and not what you think.  Like Edgar Rice Burrogh's Tarzan, he did not fare well upon transportation to other media.  Intellegence and strength are his equal weapons.

The level of detail is extraordinary.  Special investigator sheets are included, with stats specific to an Antarctic investigator.<br />Oh Boy!  Make sure you are prepared before you embark on this adventure.  &quot;Beyond the Mountains of Madness&quot; is an incredible investment in time and energy.  The book assumes that the keeper has read and is familiar with both &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; as well as Poe's &quot;Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket.&quot;  (As far as preparation goes, this is a joy.  They are both great books, and should be read anyways.)  It took our group about 5 months to complete, and we skipped several optional sections.  The adventure takes place in several chapters, including preparing for the trip, the ocean trip to Antarctica, on Antarctica, and then the trip home.<br />The book is a challenge for both keepers and players.  If done well, this will be one of your best adventures ever.	2002-04-30

Lovecraft (5.6.1 Edition / Version 5.6.1)	Books	5	11	11	N	N	The best RPG I have ever played	&quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; is hands-down my favorite RPG.  I have been playing it for about 15 years now, and have to yet to get bored with it.  In a testament to it's quality, the core rule book has gone through 5 editions without any changes to the core rules.  This version, the 5th edition, is improved by higher production value, nicer art, inclusion of spells/artifacts created for various adventures over the years, and the necessary addition of H.P. Lovecraft's signature story, &quot;The Call of Cthulhu.&quot;<br />&quot;Call of Cthulhu's&quot; strength is in it's simplicity.  The basic d100 system allows for near instant character creation and absorption of the rules.  As an RPG, it is a non-combat game that focuses more on roleplaying and atmosphere.  (Indeed, investigators who are combat happy will be short lived.  &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; is famous for it's high body count.)<br />This system has won pretty much every RPG award available.  It is the &quot;system of choice&quot; for my regular gaming group of 10 years.  Possibly the best roleplaying game ever made.	2002-04-30

In preparation for an extended trip to Japan, I wanted to learn a little more about this important event.<br />Ronald Takaki does an excellent job encapsulating the political climate in the U.S., Japan and Russia of 1945.  The death of Roosevelt and the elevation of Truman to the presidency had a profound impact on world events.  These presidents had different philosophies concerning the use of atomic weapons, and the world might be a very different place had Roosevelt lived to see the end of the war.  Truman and Stalin provided a smooth transition from World War II to the beginnings of the Cold War.<br />Ultimately, I left \\"Hiroshima : Why America Dropped the Atomic Bomb\\" with a better understanding and appreciation of why America decided to use atomic weapons against Japan.  Takaki provides motivations for most of the key players, along with supporting evidence.  The book is extremely readable, and was as captivating as any novel.<br />Whether or not dropping the bomb was \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" is left up to the reader.  Honestly, I have yet to decide.	2002-04-29

J.R.R. Tolkien performed these snippets for friends, in order to get their opinion of his new story as well as inspire himself to pursue publication.  It is pretty fortunate that they were recorded.<br />Of course, the recording quality of these informal chats is not top-notch, but I would expect nothing different.  These are not professional recordings, but probably just someone with a recording machine in a living room while Tolkien performs.  They are intimate, and a wonder to hear.  Imagine if you could have been there, with Professor Tolkien trying to interest you in his funny little stories!<br />Tolkien reads excerpts from several of his books, including &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;  He reads &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,&quot; and sings a few of his songs.  It is great fun to hear the &quot;gollum&quot; noise as he envisioned it, as well as the Elvish language spoken by it's author.<br />I highly recommend these recordings.  They are a window into the past.	2002-04-24

He is an absolute master of the short story and the poem.  A collection of Poe's writings is a welcome addition to any bookshelf.  I would not, however, chose this particular collection.<br />Because all of his works fit handsomely in a single volume, there is no real need to purchase a &quot;selected works&quot; version like this one.

Each region is well outlined, with sites of interest highlighted and places to eat and places to stay ranked on a five star system.  The maps are hard to read due to their size, and a larger map to accompany the guidebook is a &quot;must have.&quot;<br />Of special notice is the brief history of Japan included, as well as some pithy cultural notes and explanations.  Several cities's histories are examined as well.  I found all of the additional information very helpful.	2002-04-23

Smallville is an easy swap for Bedford Falls,  and the Kents could easily be the steadfast Bailys.  (In a direct homage, Pete Ross says &quot;I wish I had a million dollars!&quot; at the soda fountain.)<br />It's a good fit.  Jeph Loeb captures the 1940's idealistic dream of the 1930's perfectly, while still managing to set the series in modern times.  Lex Luthor makes a nice glowering Mr. Potter,  greedily lusting after the only thing his money can't buy.  This optimistic writing style comes as quite a surprise from the pen of a writer most known for giving us the darkest side of Batman.<br />Keeping with the theme, Tim Sale borrows heavily from the Fleischer Superman cartoons of the early 1940's including a brilliant adaptation of the Fleischer's flying effect for Superman.  The art is very stylized, and suits the story.  Superman is huge, in the way that a big brother is huge to a small child.  His size is comforting, rather than intimidating.<br />There are few comics that deserve the hardback format.  &quot;Superman for All Seasons&quot; is one of them.	2002-04-23

Do psychic powers require a child's mind?  Is the old man evil or simple?  These things are never explained.<br />The art compliments the lightning-quick pace of the story.  Everything looks like a well-done action movie, with quick cuts and quicker camera movement.  The art is incredibly detailed, and the apartment complex is a fully realized environment.<br />You may find yourself out of breath after reading a few pages.

Lovecraft, I suppose that is a good thing.  However, as a longtime player of Call of Cthulhu, I see no real need for this book.  I have done a few campaigns now using d20 Cthulhu. Quite a bit is lost in the translation to d20, and nothing is really gained.<br />D20 makes for more combat-orientated roleplaying.  Stats such as Armor Class seem strange in a game with no armor. (Defense, used in Star Wars d20 would have been a better choice.) The majority of feats are combat focused, and thus useless when facing down Mythos beasts.  That essential feeling of helplessness, of fear when confronting the Mythos, is lost when your character can attack using \\"Great Cleave\\" and \\"Autofire.\\"<br />Experience points are hard to calculate when the main challenge is going to the library.  The original Sanity system is retained, which does not make sense in a d20 system.<br />The feel of this book is just not...Lovecraftian.  It feels more like the \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy than \\"Shadow over Innsmouth.\\"  An action movie that peppers Lovecraft in to lend it some mystique and street cred, rather than the Victorian atmosphere of Weird fiction.<br />The original is still best.  Chaosium's d100 Call of Cthulhu is pretty much a perfect roleplaying game, and there is nothing added by moving to the d20 system other than catching the eye of the D & D crowd.  But, I suppose that is the point.	2002-04-17

In both physical size and length, it is an unintimidating invitation to those seeking to learn more about a director whose films they enjoy.  It is the most visual of Kurosawa studies, which is nice considering that films are a visual medium.  There are both candid on-set shots as well as film stills.<br />The book is designed for browsing, and does not need to be read front to back.  A reader can easily skip around to the films that they are interested in.  The writing is casual, and reads easy.  Too many Kurosawa books read like college texts, and Donald Richie fills a niche by supplying a book for the casual reader.<br />The only drawback to &quot;The Films of Akira Kurosawa&quot; is that your interest will be sparked for many films that are not readily available.  You will embark on a treasure hunt, seeking out rare gems such as &quot;Drunken Angel,&quot; &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; and &quot;Throne of Blood.&quot;<br />To add to the author's credentials, Donald Richie supplies the commentary track on the Criterion Collection DVD of &quot;Roshomon.&quot;	2002-04-17

First, there is no &quot;quick method.&quot;  It takes time and work.  Second, self-study only gets you so far.  Language is about communication, and that requires more than one person.<br />With this in mind, &quot;Japanese for Busy People I : Kana Version&quot; is a fine supplement to Japanese learning.  While you will never learn Japanese solely from this product,  the book will help you study and practice.  It is definitely one of the best of it's type.<br />Taking the plunge into kana is essential for learning Japanese.  This book does not teach you kana of any type, but assumes that you have learned them elsewhere (preferably from the kana workbook in this series).  Hiragana and Katakana are used.  There is no Kanji, as this is a beginners level text.<br />There is a focus on traveling businessmen, and most of the activities focus on traveling and getting around an office.  However, the vocab used in these situations is useful and easily transfers to other situations.<br />Like all self-study books, you will gain as much out of &quot;Japanese for Busy People I : Kana Version&quot; as you put into it.  Learning with a group of people is easier and more fun.  This book easily adapts to a group, and would work best if you and a few friends got together to practice.	2002-04-11

High paper quality and good inks contribute to a comics experience rarely seen elsewhere.  Truly, it is the luxury car of comics.<br />The stories inside deserve this level of presentation.  \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" available in many other collected editions, is one of the premier works of art produced by the comics medium.  \\"Batman: Year One\\" is a gem of equal quality.  The third piece, \\"Wanted: Santa Claus-Dead or Alive\\" is not written by Miller, and lacks the drama of the other stories.  He is the artist, only.  Still, it is a nice single issue Batman story, representative of that era.<br />Also included in this edition are introductions by comics resident genius Alan Moore, as well as Richard Burning and a little introspection by Frank Miller.<br />Definitely worth picking up.	2002-04-09

The book takes for granted that you are familiar with the films of Eisenstein, the books of Dostoyevsky and the plays of Bertold Brecht, as well as the personal philosophies of each of these Kurosawa influences.<br />This is also not a biography, and none of Kurosawa's personal life is put on display.  Films are dissected shot by shot in tight detail.<br />However, if you are prepared, \\"The Warrior's Camera\\" lends tremendous insight into a fascinating director.  Each chapter focuses on philosophical themes central to Kurosawa's work, and dives into the films that most represent these personal philosophies.  The strength of the individual, and the ability for personal choice, is outlined by \\"Drunken Angels,\\" \\"No Regrets for Our Youth\\" and \\"Stray Dog.\\"  Strength of will is shown in \\"Ikiru\\" and \\"Red Beard.\\"  As this is a scholarly work, each chapter presents an argument and then presents evidence to support the argument.<br />I have come away from this book with a much deeper understanding of Kurosawa and what he was trying to accomplish with his films.  Highly recommended, but be prepared to work for your knowledge.	2002-04-02

Like the first volume, \\"Who Killed Retrogirl,\\"  \\"Roleplay\\" is entirely self contained and has a complete story from beginning to end.<br />The strength of Powers lies in its almost flawless craftsmanship.  The series balances heavy drama and sharp wit, larger-than-life heroes and fully realized characters.  The razor-sharp writing is complimented by the stylized, cartoonish art and drab colors.  These are creators in full control of their art form.<br />Storywise, \\"Roleplay\\" brings the concept of heroes down to the level of impressionable college students.  Those without powers long to have them.  Lacking an incident of cosmic chance, the best they can do is play dress-up.  These innocent games draw the wrong sort of attention.

Our hero is at the center of this war.  Circles protect her.  Squares attack her.  Her feet get wet.  Somewhere locked inside this war are half-faded memories trying to get out.<br />An off kilter romance appears in the form of a high school girl in love with her school councilor.  This is not a bad thing, in context of the story.<br />The art, of course, is Sam Keith's usual brand of goodness.  He takes all of these strange story elements and welds them into a cohesive story by the force of his art.<br />And, as a topper, &quot;Zero Girl&quot; has an introduction by Alan Moore praising it.

I believe it was originally serialized, and reads like a collection of incidents rather than a complete story. However, it is a captivating tale, astounding in it's detail and casual horror. Arthur Gordon Pym was born under an unlucky star. He survives in the most inconceivable circumstances, from a drifting, overturned hulk to the frozen waters of the Antarctic. Each page turned piles more horror in his path, described with a growing clinical distance. Pym himself becomes more desensitized to each incident, until he views the irrational with a casual curiosity.

Each traveler experienced a different Japan and has different things to say about the country and it's people.  Some of the tales are funny, some are serious and some are informative.  The book has a nice balance of styles, and there is very little replication.  What is it like to go to a Love Hotel?  What do you do when you are served living squid for dinner?  What is a Kabuki play like?  These are the type of questions answered by this book.<br />It's weakness lies in the fact that many of these tales have been published elsewhere.  If you have read many books on Japan, chances are you will have already read many of these stories.  Several selections from &quot;Learning to Bow,&quot; &quot;Dave Barry does Japan&quot; and &quot;36 Views of Mt. Fuji&quot; are here.<br />All in all, it is a good book, and worth reading.	2002-03-08

King Leonidas and his personal guard of 300 Spartans personified courage and individual strength, as they held off the more than 100,000 strong Persian army, lead by Xerxes the Great King.  Think about those numbers.  300 against more than 100,000.<br />For three days, the Spartans stood against Xerxes until a betrayal lead to their downfall.  This is manly, hot-blooded stuff here.  I cannot think of any other artist who could do it justice.<br />Frank Miller was made for manly, hot-blooded stuff.  His art style, used to perfection in \\"300,\\" is all about strength and weight.  The Spartans are carved from the rocky terrain of Greece.  Heavy outlines and squared corners add to the effect.  The costume designs are symbolic rather than historic, and each heavy cape and bronze sword is used to full effect.  Lynn Varley's colors are at the top of her game.<br />This is a work of art, but it isn't pretty.<br />Story wise, Miller has done a clever job of adapting this historical event into a reasonably short comic.  Along with the necessary bravado and familiar Spartan quotations (\\"Return with your shields, or on them!\\"), he has breathed life and an certain sensitivity into Leonidas and Xerxes.  This mix of story and art is all that is good about comics.<br />This edition, in particular, showcases Miller's art and story.  The oversized hardcover with high print quality puts the pages in your face.  Varley's colors are vibrant.  A very worthy purchase.	2002-02-22

It's like a meal entirely of popcorn.  Tasty, fun, but not really filling.<br />The speed with which this book gets read says something about it's depth.  It's key strength is the factual account of the life a Gion Geisha in the 1920's.  I feel like I took a quick course on Geishas.  The weakness of the book lies in storytelling.  I have no real attachments to any of the characters.  Suyari pretty much gets life handed to her on a silver platter.  She is a very uncompelling heroine with few admirable qualities other than her features.  She is a great Geisha because she is beautiful, and because benefactors choose to present her as a great Geisha.  She achieves nothing by her own devices, and lives only by the whims of others.  The only character that I had empathy for is Nobu, whose story is never adequately told.  I was disappointed by the ending, which was a little too &quot;Hollywood.&quot;<br />All this aside, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; is a fun book to read.  I enjoyed it.  I recommend it.

This is the tale as Lovecraft envisioned it.  Anyone familiar with &quot;The Annotated H.P. Lovecraft&quot; will appreciate S.T. Joshi's meticulous notes and annotations.  He adds another layer of insight to these familiar stories.<br />My favorite feature, however, is the restoration of the pulp cover from Astounding Stories 6-36 where the story first appeared.

Stevens is a deeply emotional, romantic person who suppresses every aspect of his \\"self\\" in a bid to achieve \\"dignity in keeping with his position.\\"  This book is a study of the idea of public and private selves, as seen through the lenses of the cultures of Japan (the author) and Great Britain (the setting).<br />There are several stories being told here; the social-political drama of the Nazis and Lord Darlington,  the fading class system of Great Britain after WWII, and the subtle romance of Stevens and Mrs. Kenton.  The first two stories and interesting on a historical level as well as a character level.  There is a sadness to Lord Darlington and to the occupants of Darlington Hall who feel a treasured way of life slipping from their fingers.<br />The third story, of Stevens and Mrs. Kenton, is deep and full of heartbreak.  Highly recommended.	2002-02-12

The story is a classic Japanese folktale interpreted by one of Japan's greatest writers.  A cautionary tale about love between humans and spirits,  it is a well paced story, calm and quiet like a new moon.  The text is balanced with the original Japanese script on one side and the English translation on the other.  Interspersed though out are beautiful paper-cut illustrations.  &quot;Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; is very much a piece of book art.<br />The only drawback of this edition is the size.  It is small, and would have benefited from a hard-backed coffee table edition.  As it is, it is too fragile to be a child's book.	2002-02-11

I have recently been wading through a series of Japan-orientated intercultural texts, and this book was a breath of fresh air.  It is equal parts funny and insightful.<br />The book takes an irreverent, realistic look at Japan.  This is the point of view of the tourist.  Some things, like plastic squid and Sumo, really are strange to us.  Dave Barry is not afraid to call a spade a spade.  He does not attempt to cross-examine his own cultural biases, but just is happy to say \\"Look at that.  Weird.\\"  Also, he is a very funny writer.  I have not read any Dave Barry books before this one.  The chapter on Hiroshima shows that he can be respectful as well as silly.  That chapter really made the book for me.<br />My only real complaint with the book is that it is \\"thin.\\"  It is a short book, with a large font.  Unlike humorous travelogues by Bill Bryson, this book has very little depth and is no more than a \\"surface glance\\" at a small part (Tokyo and Kyoto) of Japan.  However, Dave Barry is honest about this and says so straight out.  Still, it is lots of fun.	2002-01-25

This book is a great overview of Japan's JET program.  While most of the research was done on the early years of the program, the author has kept in touch over the years and includes a chapter on JET in the 2000's.  The main players are introduced, and the functions of CLAIR, AJET,  JETAA and the various ministries are outlined.  I found the information on how JETs are placed to be very insightful.  Also, some fairly common cultural misunderstandings are focused on.  Perhaps JETs who read this book will not make the same mistakes as their predecessors.<br />The author does a nice job of presenting both sides of the JET program.  The opinions of the Japanese teachers and administrators is counter balanced with the opinions of the JETs themselves.  As expected, the viewpoints rarely match.  There is a great section on a JET who felt that she had had a great experience, and that everyone was happy with her performance.  The Japanese host institution was glad when she finally left.<br />The book does tend to emphasize the bad experiences over the good.  Statistics show that JETs who break contract are fairly rare, yet they make up the majority of the interviewees.  The author does not imply that this is the majority experience, just that they make for more interesting reading.	2002-01-23

The voice actors do a great job, and actual children play the four kids.  The various accents of the British Isles are on display, which adds a realistic touch.  Music and sound effects are well used to evoke mood and excitement.  Imagination is one of the main benefits of radio theater, and the BBC knows how to do it right.  The White Witch is terrible.  Aslan is good, but not safe.<br />I think that they have produced, or are currently producing, the entire series as audio dramas.  I will definitely be looking into the others.	2002-01-23

Unlike many books about Japanese culture, this book is funny and &quot;living.&quot;  The book contains a series of anecdotes, each one focusing on a particular experience that Bruce S. Feiler had during his stay.  The stories are written as first-person memoirs,  and cover such broad topics as Hiroshima and Nagasaki to how to date a Japanese girl.  The writing is clever and engaging.<br />The only thing I felt this book was lacking was an update of some sort.  Written about 11 years ago, &quot;Learning to Bow&quot; is about Japan during the &quot;bubble economy.&quot;  Japan has gone through severe economic and societal changes since then, and I wonder how much of the information is still current.  Surely, with the JET program in full swing for several decades now, the presence of foreigners is not such a surprise anymore.  Also, the place of women has gone through some significant changes since this book was written.<br />Still, anyone planning a long-term stay in Japan should read this book.  It is fun, insightful and has great tips for climbing Mt. Fuji.	2002-01-16

It also includes the Supergirl &quot;try-out&quot; issue from Action Comics #123, where Jimmy Olsen wishes up a &quot;Super-Girl&quot; companion for his buddy Superman.  It all ends badly of course, but paves the way for Superman's cousin, Kara Zor-El to arrive in a rocket 8 months later.<br />In these early issues, Supergirl is hidden away from the public.  She is Superman's secret weapon and spends most of her time maintaining her secret identity of orphan Linda Danvers.  Eventually, she goes to the future to meet the Legion of Super-Heroes and Tommy Tomorrow.  Her pet, Streaky the Supercat shows up as well.<br />The stories, written mainly by Otto Binder of Marvel Family fame, showcase the beginning of what would become the Superman Family.  Soon Comet the Superhorse, Beppo the Supermonky and the entire bottle city of Kandor would be roaming around with &quot;The Last Son of Krypton.&quot;  There is a charming innocence in the stories,  and they are very well crafted silver age comics.  The art, by Jim Mooney and Al Plastino,  is suiting to the stories.  The new Frank Miller cover is a nice addition, although an odd choice as he is not an artist one associates with the character of Supergirl.	2002-01-10

I already own &quot;Elements of Style,&quot; and that has been my main helper in the past.<br />Wow!  I was blown away by this useful book.  Its or It's?  Now I know.  Who's or Whose?  Now I know.  The writing style of this book is breezy and fun, yet the information is solid.  The book can be read straight through, or kept on the shelf as a reference.  I recommend both approaches.  I read the book in it's entire first, and now I check back on it when needed.<br />I am not sure how good this book is for those who already have a strong grasp of grammar.

Julius Schwartz was a literary agent for H.P. Lovecraft, Ray Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Robert A. Heinlein and a host of others from the golden age of pulp magazines.  As an editor for D. C Comics, he was instrumental in the revival of the comic book industry during it's &quot;Silver Age.&quot;  He relaunched the Flash and Green Lantern, and he put the yellow circle around the Bat signal.<br />The cast of characters in this memoir is truly amazing, but the names are dropped out of true friendship rather than self-promotion.  The book is brimming with affection for old friends long gone,  and new friends to pass the torch to.  There is a nice piece about Julie attending a Lovecraft convention, where he was the only person in the room that had actually met the author.<br />The book is not thick, and there are no secrets to be revealed.  There is some interesting insight into being an editor in the comics field, but that is not the focus.  However, the book is so charming, so full of love for this industry and the people in it that reading it is an enjoyable experience.  The afterword by Harlan Elison ends with simply, &quot;I love you, Julie.&quot;  Definitely a guy I'd like to know.	2002-01-03

They were purchased, rolled-up, traded and then thrown away.  However, those four-color wonders had enough of an impact on a few people that, In the 1970's, they decided to create the hobby known as comics.  Those few people decided to write &quot;The Comic-book Book.&quot;<br />&quot;The Comic-book Book,&quot; like its predecessor &quot;All in Color for a Dime,&quot; is the misty recollections of a group of friends who share the love of this peculiar art form.  Each author writes an essay about the genre that affected him/her most.  One essay is about the Frankenstein monster, and it's legacy in comics.  Another author writes about the romance of the aviator, and how comics entered World War II before America.  The Spirit and Will Eisner are the subject of one essay, and the magicians of comics (Mandrake, Zatara, Ibis...) fills another.  Each essay is well written, although not particularly scholarly.  Many of the authors are writing from memory, as original material was hard to locate.<br />The best thing about reading &quot;The Comic-book Book&quot; is being able to glimpse into the past, and see people gushing about comics that carry little or no monetary value.  The high prices for golden age comics had not yet appeared, and the affection is genuine.  A nice book to read for anyone who loves the hobby of comics.	2002-01-03

The flavor of the character has changed over the years from grim to goofy and back to grim.  He is at times a detective,  at times a superhero and at times a science fiction hero.  This book, &quot;The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told&quot; does an admirable job of pulling the best of each incarnation of Batman and presenting them in a single volume.  Each story is a well-chosen and enjoyable read.<br />Bob Kane, Bill Finger, Dick Sprang, Neal Adams, Steve Englehart, Marshall Rogers are Dick Giordano are all represented.  Each of these creators touched Batman in a permanent way.  Noticeably absent are Frank Miller (The Dark Knight Returns, Batman: Year One) and Alan Moore/Brian Bolland (The Killing Joke).  In the introduction, it is stated that these famous Batman creators are well-represented in other reprint collections and thus were not included in this volume.  It is nice to know that they were acknowledged.<br />Those who were introduced to Batman by the movies and the accompanying 90's rebirth may be disappointed by this volume.  It does cover the Batman character as a whole, and not only one phase (Grim and Gritty).  Also, the Joker has a companion volume, &quot;The Greatest Joker Stories Ever Told,&quot;  so there are few Joker stories included.	2001-12-20

This collection is hard to find, but worth it.<br />&quot;Shazam: From the 40's to the 70's&quot; is a nice collection of Fawcett &quot;firsts.&quot;  The first Tawky Tawny story is included, along with the first Mary Marvel story and the first Captain Marvel Jr. story.  It does try to represent the various incarnations of Captain Marvel, and includes reprints from all decades.  The more realistic Marvel Family from the 40's flows into the Sci-Fi silliness of the 50's and the hipster of the 70's.  It is nice to know that the Big Red Cheese keeps up with the times.<br />The reprints are in black and white, with only two stories (the origin from Whiz #2, and a modern story from the 70's) are in color.  The introduction by E. Nelson Bridgewell is nice, although certain famous Marvel Family artists like C.C. Beck have publicly disagreed with it.  The DC Archives series is a better collection with better production values, but does not reprint the same stories.<br />If you find a copy, snatch it up!	2001-12-20

This adaptation of British classic &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is perfect.  The actors are all spot-on, and each of them is a skilled voice actor.  Peter Woodthorpe, who plays Gollum, also does the voice of Gollum for the Ralph Bakshi animated version.<br />If you have never listened to a radio drama before, you are in for a treat.  The story is treated with respect and reverence.  Minor changes are made in the adaptation, but nothing that disturbs the overall story.  The entire production rings in at 13 hours.<br />For a fantasy story, this is probably the best way to experience a story after the original books.  The imagery and adventure still take place in your mind.  The characters will look like &quot;your&quot; characters.  Give it a try!	2001-12-10

I finally got to throw the old recordings away when I got this excellent box set.  As a long time fan, I could not be happier with this collection.<br />The Star Wars trilogy translates well to the radio play format.  It helps that a few of the original cast members reprised their roles.  Anthony Daniels is the mainstay, and voices 3-CPO through all three productions.  The other cast members are all talented radio actors, and suited to their parts.  The actors keep their roles for all three productions, so there is nice continuity of character.<br />The stories are considerable longer than the films, and fill in the gaps of the storyline.  Star Wars contains all of the famous deleted footage between Luke and Biggs, as well as a window into Luke's life on Tatooine.  (As a side note, some of this was included in the Star Wars special edition re-release, as well as The Phantom Menace.  Look for the pod racers to &quot;thread the stone needle&quot; as described in the radio play.)  The other two series are not as expansive, but still deliver more story than the film.  The excitement and gradure of the series is well translated to audio.<br />This collector's set includes many extras not available in the standard releases.  These include commercials, making-of features, and the touching get well card to Brian.  The box is very nice, and the entire set has very high production values.  It is worth the price.	2001-12-10

Like many American readers, I only knew Roald Dahl from his children's books.  I picked this book up expecting lighter fare.  Wow, was I in for a chilling surprise.<br />This book is one of the best-written horror collections that I own.  In this case, horror does not mean monsters but simply people being cruel and spiteful to each other in clever and interesting ways.  The language and writing of the stories is captivating.  Descriptive text flows from every page.  The pacing of the stories is precise.  This is a talented writer in full command of his skills.<br />A few examples of the stories:  A man with new money hosts a dinner party,  and a famous epicurean is invited.  The host bets the epicurean that he can not name the wine being served.  The stakes of the bet is the host's unwilling daughter.  A homeless man bears the tattoo of a famous artist on his skin.  Many wealthy collectors plot for the man's skin.  The man is not needed.  There are many other tales, each with a distinct brand of meanness.<br />Strangely enough, a few of these tales are very familiar.  I realized later that they were dramatized on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents.&quot;  I highly recommend the &quot;Roald Dahl Omnibus.&quot;	2001-12-07

Each installment consist of Alex Ross's reverent paintings and Paul Dini's text.<br />Wonder Woman shines in the large coffee-table size format.  Alex Ross obviously had fun with this character and her costume.  Her bright, satin cape is a shiny stand-out.  Her face has the rigid beauty of a Greek statue, which is only fitting.  The invisible jet is done correctly for the first time.  Visually, the book is as dramatic as the previous offerings in this series.<br />The story involves Diana's mis-understanding of what it means to be human, and her quest to make a connection with the women of the world.  There are some really tender moments.  Paul Dini's strength is not serious prose writing, but he does an admirable job accompanying Ross's overwhelming art.<br />The cameo from a certain Clark Kent is pretty fun, but a little strange.  Previous books have focused exclusively on the character, where as this one gets a little help from a friend.  Still, very enjoyable.	2001-12-04

Each story is somewhat plotless, but is more of a brief character study.  A quick sketch, at the most, that captures the essence of the character rather than the details.  Each character and situation is a glimpse into the past, of Japan at that time. The stories have the quiet patience of a haiku, and the miniature perfection of a well-tended bonsai tree.<br />Like a haiku, the limitation of form requires that each sentence be important.  There are no throw-away lines in any of the &quot;Palm-of-the-Hand Stories.&quot;  The sparse loveliness of the English language as used is interesting because the book is translated from Japanese.  The book was translated by two translators, and each story is signed so you know who translated what.  This allows for subtle variance in the stories.<br />Kawabata is Japan's first Nobel prize winner.  This is the first book by Kawabata that I have read, and I will be sure to seek other's out.  A final recommendation, because of the length of the stories, I have found this to be one of the best bedside books I own.  I can read a quick story before going to sleep.	2001-11-15

Don't expect to pick this up as a first Japanese book, however! In the introduction, the author admits that &quot;Basic Japanese Through Comics&quot; may be a little misleading. It is basic Japanese, but the book assumes that you have studied a year or more in a classroom environment.<br />With that aside, this is the best resource I have seen for transforming &quot;classroom&quot; Japanese into &quot;natural&quot; Japanese. The book uses popular Japanese manga to smooth out some common errors for Japanese learners. For example, there are two chapters discussing the many uses of &quot;Hai&quot; and one chapter on how to naturally say &quot;anno...&quot;<br />The manga used is very fun and gives a good cultural insight into daily Japan. No giant robots or magical girls, it is mainly office humor in the same line as &quot;Dilbert.&quot; The office humor demonstrates varying levels of polite language, and Mangajin is kind enough to offer a &quot;politeness scale&quot; to show how polite anyone is being in a given setting. This is very useful, as politeness levels is where many English speakers find themselves in trouble in Japan!	2001-11-09

The stories are the corrected versions, and the presentation is tasteful and classic.<br />&quot;The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories&quot; is packed with some of Lovecraft's best stories.  &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot; stands out as one of the best short stories I have ever read.  In Paris, in a street that can no longer be found, a student lodger is disturbed by unearthly violin music drifting from the top floors.  Who is Erich Zann, and where does he learn these strange tunes?<br />Other classics in this collection are &quot;The Dunwich Horror,&quot; featuring the infamous Necronomicon.  &quot;At the Mountains of Madness,&quot; Lovecraft's longest story is a mixture of Edgar Allen Poes &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot; and his own creatures from beyond.  Set in the Antarctic, this has been the inspiration for several films.  &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; and &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; are both excellent.

He is an expert dreamer, who passes at will through the Gates of Deeper Slumber and openly defies the mythos.  He rides Night Gaunts and communicates with Ghouls, Zoots and Cats.  In this way, the Randolph Carter series is entirely unlike Lovecraft's other weird tales.  The reader actually gets the feeling that things will work out for Randolph Carter.<br />While to stories are different in tone, they are not different in content.  In &quot;Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath,&quot;  Randolph Carter goes in search of Unknown Kadath, the mountainous home of the gods.  In his long journey, he  drifts in and out of other stories, encountering Richard Upton Pickman, the City of Celephais, the Cats of Ulthur and an enjoyable assortment of other characters.  I advise you to read this story with other Lovecraft books at hand,  to reference the cast of characters.<br />Other tales in this volume complete the quests of Randolph Carter,  and tell the stories of other journeys through the Dreamlands.  Each story is enjoyable, mixing fancy and horror in equal measure.  I recommend this book to fans of &quot;The Sandman.&quot;	2001-10-16

They were brought in to replace Superman while Colyer was on vacation.<br />Other serials include &quot;The Man Without a Face,&quot;  &quot;The Phantom of the Sea,&quot; &quot;Mystery of the Lost Planet,&quot; &quot;The Monkey Burglar,&quot; &quot;Drought in Freeville,&quot; and &quot;The Story of Marina Baum.&quot;<br />The only drawback of this collection is that it is not available on CD.  Still, an excellent purchase.	2001-10-10

Brian Michael Bendis obviously wanted to write crime drama comics, but was a little trapped by the omnipresence of Superheroes.  As a compromise, he did a superhero crime drama,  and it is really, really good.<br />&quot;Powers&quot; is character driven and full of dry humor.  The storyline is very dark, in the same tone as &quot;Seven.&quot;  The animated-style art work is excellent at portraying the serious subject matter, and the dialog between characters is perfect.  I don't know another writer that has such a grasp of dialog.<br />The conscious use of panels is something I haven't seen since Matt Wagner's &quot;Grendel.&quot;  There are few creators in comic books that make full use of the comics medium, and most creators follow  somewhat standard layouts and formulaic story lines.  This is a comic for people who enjoyed Scott McCloud's &quot;Understanding Comics.&quot;<br />If you are a fan of fun, high-quality, intelligent comics, you should read &quot;Powers: Who Killed Retro Girl?&quot;  It is that simple.	2001-09-27

Don't expect to pick this up as a first Japanese book, however!  In the introduction, the author admits that &quot;Basic Japanese Through Comics&quot; may be a little misleading.  It is basic Japanese, but the book assumes that you have studied a year or more in a classroom environment.<br />With that aside, this is the best resource I have seen for transforming &quot;classroom&quot; Japanese into &quot;natural&quot; Japanese.  The book uses popular Japanese manga to smooth out some common errors for Japanese learners.  For example, there are two chapters discussing the many uses of &quot;Hai&quot; and one chapter on how to naturally say &quot;anno...&quot;<br />The manga used is very fun and gives a good cultural insight into daily Japan.  No giant robots or magical girls, it is mainly office humor in the same line as &quot;Dilbert.&quot;  The  office humor demonstrates varying levels of polite language, and  Mangajin is kind enough to offer a &quot;politeness scale&quot; to show how polite anyone is being in a given setting.  This is very useful, as politeness levels is where many English speakers find themselves in trouble in Japan!	2001-09-25

It is not an anecdotal book, and the writing style is more of what you would find in a textbook.<br />There is some excellent advice on obtaining visas, and a good introduction to the various types of English teacher positions available, from the informal &quot;coffee shop school&quot; to the more formal JET program. The book gives a brief glimpse of Japanese history and culture, but that is not a majority focus.<br />Fully half of &quot;Teaching English in Japan&quot; is focused on practical, specific English teaching skills. There is a good introduction to pronunciation mistakes common to Japanese learners, as well as a solid coverage of grammar and tenses that occur in English, but not Japanese. A chapter is devoted to creating lesson plans, and another chapter introduces various teaching styles and tools.<br />If you want to teach English, but have never done so before, this book will give you a good idea of what will be expected of you. Don't expect to memorize every lesson in the book. It is a valuable reference to pack along to Japan, and pull out again and again.	2001-09-24
US	51959847	R1POENO3IZ6PEU	0694524190	850713424	Edgar Allan Poe Audio Collection	Books	5	112	113	N	N	Just about perfect	This 5 disk collection of Edgar Allen Poe's works is one of the best audio collections I have ever heard. Generally, I am a fan of the &quot;radio play&quot; style of spoken audio, with a full cast and appropriate sound effects. Yet, Poe's work (especially on the represented stories) tends to be from a single point of view, and largely take place in the mind of the main character. This first person style lends itself well to a single narrator. I could not imagine two better chosen narrators.<br />The heritage of radio shines in there performances. These are two actors who cut their teeth in radio, in shows such as &quot;Suspence,&quot; &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.&quot; Voice acting is almost a lost art. It is amazing, the sheer richness that comes from hearing Poe's words manipulated by such talented voices.<br />Vincent Price, famous for his sinister voice, is a natural for Poe. He does fewer pieces, voicing &quot;Ligeia,&quot; &quot;The Imp of the Perverse,&quot; &quot;Morella,&quot; &quot;Berenice&quot; and &quot;The Gold Bug.&quot; All of them are well done, with &quot;Ligeia&quot; being a stand out.<br />Basil Rathbone does the lion's share of the CD set. As I was not as familiar with him, I was a little disappointed about this. Then I heard him speak. Wow. His voice is superb, and obviously highly-trained. I prefer him to Price on the recordings, and I am thankful that he voices my favorite pieces. He slips easily between prose and poetry, and has a voice full of both emotion and cold regard. Rathbone lends his tenor to &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart,&quot; The Fall of the House of Usher,&quot; The Black Cat,&quot; &quot;The Cask of Amontillado,&quot; The Masque of the Red Death,&quot; &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum,&quot; &quot;The Haunted Palace,&quot; &quot;The Bells,&quot; &quot;The Facts of the Case of M. Valdemar,&quot; &quot;The Raven,&quot; &quot;Annabel Lee,&quot; &quot;Eldorado,&quot; &quot;To--,&quot; &quot;Alone&quot; and &quot;The City in the Sea.&quot;<br />Are there flaws to the set? Sure. The long tracks mean you have to listen to each story in one go. There are some abridgments, if you follow along with the books. However, the talent of the narrators combined with the respect for the words being spoken outweigh any flaws. This is a truly exceptional collection.lone&quot; and &quot;The City in the Sea.&quot; <br />Are there flaws to the set? Sure. The long tracks mean you have to listen to each story in one go.

It is assumed that if you are reading this, you are either in lessons or considering them.  With that in mind, this is an excellent companion text for a beginning fencer.<br />In many ways, this book fills in the missing gaps in lessons.  It contains the background and the evolution of the sport.  It describes the basic attacks and defense, the takes and ripostes.  It shows the footwork and lays out the rules.  There is a nice little piece about leverage and some interesting theories and tactics.  I found that is was a good way to keep my brain wrapped around fencing while I waited for the next lesson.<br />It does address an older style of fencing, and may not jibe with your instructor. Ultimately, &quot;The Art and Science of Fencing&quot; is a one man's opinion on the sport of fencing.  It is, however, an informed opinion.  There will be ideas in this book that you will disagree with.  That's OK.  I am sure that you will find many ideas that you also agree with and can learn from.	2001-05-14

This is high quality comics.  &quot;Batman: Gotham Adventures&quot; is the Batman family unrestrained by years of complex continuity coupled with interesting, fun stories that strike at the heart of the characters.  The art is dynamic and fluid, following Bruce Timm's &quot;animated&quot; style.<br />This collection takes up where &quot;The Batman Adventures : The Lost Years&quot; leaves off.  Dick Grayson has taken up the mantle of Nightwing, and has come to terms with the replacement Robin, Tim Drake.  Bruce Wayne has accepted the need for allies in his personal war.  (yes, there really is this level of characterization.)  Best of all, Barbara Gordon is not in a wheel chair, but flying alongside them in her role as Batgirl.<br />Good fun, which is somthing that tends to be missing from modern comics.	2001-04-11

A multi-layered production in both story and sound, Fat Cats is recorded with a Neumann ku8li binaural microphone.  This technique produces &quot;3-D&quot; sound.  With head phones on, the sound swallows you up, enveloping you in a way no other medium can match.<br />I have experienced a few of these 3-D recordings before, and this is the first one I found where the story makes good use of the technique.  Bill Raymond plays a painter, Willie,  who fantasizes about being a detective.  Willie floats in and out of the adventures of his hero, the hard boiled detective Short Top Detroit.  He is hired to paint the house of Lucas Trust, a billionaire who's girlfriend is a prominent wet T-shirt model, Christie Adair.  This could be a recipe for cheap thrills, but the story is in ZBS' good hands.  Playing against stereotypes, Christie is intelligent and sees the irony of her profession.  Willie varies his time between reading cheap detective novels and listening to recordings of Abbie Hoffman.  Lucas is involved in murder.<br />Willie tries to put the pieces together while his hero Short Top Detroit teaches him the art of sleuthing.  Slowly, the lines between the two characters begin to blur.	2001-04-10

This audio adventure is very smart, with some good thinking interlaced with a witty story.<br />It's full of clever characters such as And/Or, the technician with an illegal love for a very special android, Angel Lips, the special android whose programmer gave her free will with mixed results, TJ Teru, the archeologist with a taste for plastic, and Ruby, the tough talking galactic gumshoe with the psychic power to stop time.

For those who are taking their first glance, I recommend &quot;The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics).&quot;  or &quot;Best of H.P. Lovecraft : Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre .&quot; It is also not an &quot;expert's&quot; Lovecraft, who have already tackled the fine Arkham House &quot;Selected Letters&quot; volumes, or such arcane tomes as &quot;The Philosophy of H.P. Lovecraft : The Route to Horror (New Studies in Aesthetics, Vol. 29).&quot;<br />What it is, is an &quot;intermediate's&quot;  Lovecraft, perfect for those who enjoy his stories, and want to peel back one small layer of the onion and look beneath the surface.  The volume focuses on his major works, and the annotations range from the broad, such as definitions of words, to the minute, such as genealogy of local towns.  There is a nice selection of photographs of Lovecraft's early homes and some locations of stories.  The annotations also include some informative biographical notes that help explain his stories, such as Lovecraft's fear of seafood and the cold, or the fact that he was dressed as a little girl when he was a baby.<br />Definitely read other editions of his works first,  so that you may enjoy his stories as stories.  Then, when you want to take one small step further, give this annotated edition a try.	2001-01-03

I believe it was originally serialized, and reads like a collection of incidents rather than a complete story.  However, it is a captivating tale, astounding in it's detail and casual horror.  Arthur Gordon Pym was born under an unlucky star.  He survives in the most inconceivable circumstances, from a drifting, overturned hulk to the frozen waters of the Antarctic.  Each page turned piles more horror in his path, described with a growing clinical distance.  Pym himself becomes more desensitized to each incident, until he views the irrational with a casual curiosity.  The language is beautifully detailed, and some feel this story is the inspiration for &quot;Moby Dick.&quot;<br />Altogether, a delightfully disturbing story.  One of the best I have read.	2000-12-29

Power of Hope	Books	5	21	23	N	N	The power of a good story	I was completely impressed with the latest installment of Paul Dini and Alex Ross' tabloid size series.  In these volumes, they have captured the core spirit of classic characters.<br />Captain Marvel is a different character than Superman.  Superman feels the call of responsibility, that his powers are not his alone but a gift for all mankind.  Captain Marvel feels a sense of wonder at his powers, and has fun with them.  He is, after all, a kid at heart.  This volume truly brings home that point.  One of my favorite scenes shows Captain Marvel stifling a yawn as a bank robber brandishes a shotgun.  This is a classic scene from the old Fawcetts, and it made me smile.  Actually, many of the panels made me smile fondly. Maybe that is why I like Captain Marvel so much.<br />Naturally, it is impossible to discuss an Alex Ross piece without commenting on the art.  It is extraordinary, and completely up to par.  Paul Dini's prose adds to the spectacle.  While saying nothing new about Captain Marvel,  The Power of Hope rephrases what we already know quite eloquently.	2000-12-06

I think this book introduced me to the idea of studying.  When I was young, I devoured this.  I knew every story, every character, and every adventure.  This was the foundation for more book reports and special projects than I could list.  The myths are presented in an easily understandable format that does not talk down to children.  The illustrations, while simple, are full of life and charm.  This is a perfect children's book.<br />\\"D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths\\" also gave me a great insight into a more adult world, and a curiosity, which I still carry to this day.  Astronomy was no problem, as I already knew the names of things.  Science also held fewer mysteries than it might have. (Hippocratic oath anyone?)  My interest in Greek Myths lead to interest in Rome, which was followed by Shakespeare's Roman plays.  Greek statuary lead to an interest in art, and a trip to the British Museum.  Someday I hope to travel to Greece itself, and view the stomping grounds of Heracles and Belpheron.<br />All starting from this book.  I think that is a pretty good recommendation.	2000-11-10

Thousands of readers, myself included, have  disagreed with him ever since.<br />Herbert West, Re-animator definitely has a  different flavor than many of Lovecraft's tales.

The  printing is great and all the stories are in full glory.<br />It is very  interesting to see the progression of the good captain.  His military/genie  inspired costume gives way to a Supermanish one piece suit by issue #5.  Although the first stories are a little more hard, the whimsey that he is  so known for starts to poke it's friendly little head in. Dr. Sivania  arrives with a menagerie of wild beasts from Venus, including his kids  Beautia and Magnificus.  There is a great half-lion/ half-gorilla.<br />Like  all Captain Marvel, this volume is lots of fun and worth having.	2000-07-28

It is very character driven, with lots of laughs and some very touching moments.  The personalities of Maison Ikkoku change over the course of the series, and  are very well rounded.  This is a nice change from &quot;one-joke&quot;  characters and plots.  The full story is a very rewarding read.  Godai and  Kyoko 's feelings are true and deep.  This is by far the most honestly  romantic manga I have read.<br />This first volume introduces all of the  main characters and sets up some of the running jokes.  A house full of  happy drunks keeps the comic from becoming too sappy, and their are plenty  of romantic rivals for everyone's affections.  The book takes off in full  soap opera swing with wacky hijinks and misunderstood intentions.  Is  bumbling ronin Godai and challenge for the glinting teeth of wealthy Coach  Mitaka?  I sure hope so.	2000-07-05

I am a big fan of full cast audio productions (Radio Plays) so I was really looking forward to this. I don't know how they managed to get the voices so  perfect. The story is great and the audio format really adds a new  dimension. As Captain Marvel is my personal favorite, I was a little  nervous to hear Billy say &quot;Shazam!&quot; Wow! I got goosbumps. My only  wish is that they offered this on CD.	2000-06-30

This audio adventure is very smart, with some good thinking interlaced with a  witty story.<br />It's full of clever characters such as And/Or, the  technician with an illegal love for a very special android, Angel Lips, the  special android whose programmer gave her free will with mixed results, TJ  Teru, the archeologist with a taste for plastic, and Ruby, the tough  talking galactic gumshoe with the psychic power to stop time.  Ruby is  hired to find out who is controlling the media on Suma Nulla, and becomes  mixed up with the mole people and The Tookah, a creature with four  tentacles, three eyes, a blue mustache and red fez.<br />Fast-paced, funny,  and highly recommended	2000-06-27
US	51959847	R2JPJWG69DEEVI	0873414985	771890977	All in Color for a Dime	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Those were the days...	There is a story told, of a poor Italian man who lived in a small house with dirt floors.  His only true possession was a painting that has been handed down through his family.  He hung it over his fireplace.  Well,  rumors spread and a investigating Art Historian found that the painting was  a lost Bottichelli , valued at several million dollars.  After the  discovery was made public, the man was forced to sell the painting as he  could not afford security or insurance for it.  This painting that was once  appreciated for its beauty was now appreciated for its large price  tag.<br />The point of this, and there is one, is that comics were once  valueless pieces of old paper.  People loved them anyways, and loved them  enough to write this little book.  &quot;All in Color for a Dime&quot; has  a secret that modern comic collectors may have lost.  It exudes joy for the  four-color wonders know as comics.  There is so much excitement in  recounting the lost but not forgotten Captain Marvel, or even gaining new  found respect for Popeye.  All those little treasures are recounted in  personal stories.  Comics for the love of it, and not for the price tag.  Reading Golden Age comics for the stories, what a great concept!<br />However,  as a modern comics collector, I seem unable to ignore price tags entirely.  I must admit I chucked when one of the writers was astounded to learn that  a mint Action Comics #1 could be sold for up to $300.00.  Those were the  days.	2000-06-23

It has exquisite sound, and was recorded in kunstkopf binaural 3-D sound.  For those of you that have not experienced,  you are in for a treat.  It MUST  be listened to on headphones.  The story literally moves around in your  head.  It is amazing.<br />The story itself is good, but not great.  It  involves a private eyes daughter attempting to solve her dead fathers last  case, the missing statue of the Maltese Goddess.  Personally, I would have  preferred it without the songs.  I love musicals, but they do not seem to  fit an audio mystery.  The voice acting is good, and my favorite character  is the dead father heard on notes recorded before his death.<br />ZBS rarely  goes wrong, and this is no exception.	2000-05-05

Superman gets to test his might against a true super-villain.  The Atom Man has Kryptonite flowing through his veins, which gives him  mighty atomic power.  Bodies begin to pile up, including both Superman's  allies and enemies. Superman is powerless simply standing next to him.<br />I  have to admit that some of the Superman radio shows can be a little cheesy,  and are best heard through a filter of nostalgia. This one is really  exciting.  I was actually in suspense as to how, or even if, Superman would  survive.	2000-05-05

Little ginger haired Katie Morag is split between the traditional ways of Granny Island and the modern Granny Mainland.  Granny Island works with her hands and isn't afraid to get dirty.  Granny Mainland wears nice clothes and bothers about  her appearance.  Katie Morag loves them both, but they don't appreciate  each other.<br />How to solve this?  Why, with sheep of course.  How perfectly  Scottish.	2000-04-25

Suddenly, this poor kid finds his secret destiny. Why, not only is he  more than average, he is the best in the world. Then  he is taken to a magical  school where he excels, but others  resent his talent. He finds allies and enemies,  and learns a  lesson or two about life.<br />  Sound familiar? It should. This is  the plot for Ender's Game, Harry Potter, A  Wizard of Earthsea,  and numerous other genre books. It is an enjoyable  scenario which  we all can secretly relate too.<br />  Now, with Ender's Shadow we get  the same story from a different perspective.  A young boy from  meager beginnings has grown up thinking he is the best in the  world. Suddenly, this poor kid finds his secret destiny. He is taken to a  magical  school where others resent his talent, and he resents the  talents of others. He is  only second best. And he is not happy  about it.<br />  I completely enjoyed Ender's Shadow. It is not the  book that Ender's Game is,  but it openly declares that in the  title. A second tier story about a second tier  hero. It is still  worth a read.	2000-04-21

It is nice to see an artist/writer who really cares about what they are doing.  The story has all of the  elements of a great Captain Marvel story and Fawcett City has never looked  better.  Jerry Ordway has gone for a mix of classic art-deco and modern  buildings, lending a necessary air of nostalgia.  The new origin of Black  Adam is a little odd, but we finally get to see who the mysterious stranger  is that lures Billy Batson into the train tunnel.  Lots of great  &quot;in-jokes,&quot; and even a small guest appearance from Mr.  Tawky-Tawny!	2000-03-15

This is a great Scottish novel, with all of the lovely scenery and steadfast heroes desired in this type of book. Even a bit of the Gaelic!  I love the tragic character of Helen McGregor, and the classic brutal honor  of Robert Roy.<br />The scottish scenary is a vital character. I read this  book when I was living in Glasgow, and the descriptions of the city's early  days  were amazing.  I also fell in love with Loch Lomand.<br />Modern readers  be warned!  This book was written in 1817, when attention spans were  longer.  The pace is slow, and the story takes awhile to unfold.<br />I was  riveted by this book and I highly recommend it	2000-03-15

Obviously, this book is not going to have wide appeal.  I bought it more to put on display than read.  My grandmother had done the genealogy work long ago so I already had the information.<br />Russell Lee Davisson has done  an admirable job of making a rather dry subject come alive.  The  illustrations are the best part, putting a face on some locations. I would  have appreciated some anecdotes, or greater historical background of the  time periods. At the end of the day it is a list of names.  It is, after  all, a genealogy book.  The book itself is nice looking, and goes on  display well.  Nothing fancy.<br />Some of his conclusions are a little odd,  and his references to &quot;Gaelic Propaganda&quot; reveals a strange  prejudice.  As a student of the Scots-Gaelic language with friends in  Gaelic speaking Scotland, I found this off-putting.<br />All in all, a nice  book if you happen to be a Davisson	2000-03-15

Sky pirates appear of the port bow, and only Captain Jack with his Lightning Sword and  magical Top Hat can save the day.<br />The Incredible Adventures of Jack  Flanders is an enchanting audio fantasy.  It is packed with High Adventure  and Magic, and a fair amount of wisdom.  The story begins when Jack  recieves a Large Overstuffed Green Velvet chair in the mail.  At midnight,  when he slumbers in the chair, his mind travels to the fantastic realms of  the Nevermind.  His travels take him aboard the Sky Galleon &quot;Blue  Swallow,&quot;  where he clashes swords with the pirate queen &quot;The  Black Mona Lisa.&quot; He encounters Little Freida, with the piggy tales  and havana cigars.

Lovecraft.  A sample of his classic tales in an affordable volume.  Lovecraft is the finest writer of pulp horror and weird fiction.  He can be a bit of a shock for readers whose only exposure to horror is Steven King.  His tales are far more  intellectual and psychological.  This is aristocratic horror, who's  protagonist is likely to be a professor of antiquities or a dilettante in  search of anchient architecture. Forbiden tomes, such as the infamous  Necronomicon, and ancient evil await these adventures.  &quot;The Rats in  the Walls&quot; has a man victimized by a family curse.  His ancestral home  goes deeper than he expected, with each sub-basement revealing an older  period of architecture.  What evil ground was this house built on?  &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot; is a story of a small sea town with a  history, and a population with a strange look and strange ways.  Horrible  things live beneath the surface of the waters. Horrible things live above.  &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;....well, you will just have to see what  lies around that corner for yourself.	2000-01-29

The whole archive has some very different takes  on Captain Marvel, with Jack Kirby artwork on Adventures #1 and a more  realistic approach in the Spy Smasher series.

The story begins as a young woman shows Jack Flanders his own business card.  The card was given to her mother 40 years ago, yet has  Jack's current address.  Jack follows her to India, with a few cultural  stops along the way such as New Deli and The Black Hole of Calcutta.  He  confronts a genie in a palace who speaks to him in his own voice.  Dreams  of India is a mystical journey that explores themes such as growing old,  letting go, and the continual quest of Jack to be the one who watches.  It  is filled with lush sounds recorded in the streets of India, as well as  history and poetry. Very enjoyable.	2000-01-03
