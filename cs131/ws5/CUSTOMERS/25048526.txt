One morning after dodge-ball, he pulled me aside, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, \\"Son, I know your English teacher is having you read a lot of gothic Victorian novels about frightened young women who fall for mysterious, unattainable men with a dark side...\\"  He leaned down and looked me straight in the eye.  \\"You know I'm worried, don't you.  I'm worried about your manhood.  I'm worried you're going to waste that great gift you've been given, that great dodge-ball arm, and just -- \\"<br />Oh forget it.

I have always had trouble confronting change, and only recently have I come to recognize this in myself.  This past year, I lost my job, my car, my home, my pets, my furniture, and my mind.  I was confronted with the need to change my life, one step at a time, if I was ever going to elude the police.  So I went out and bought this book (a friend of mine, whom I have since lost, recommended it).  Well, all I can say is, WOW!  My life has changed!  I have come to terms with my intense desire for fresh blood, my fear of sunlight, and my feelings of dissatisfaction with the daily grind of office work.  I have gained a new job, a new home, and a new coffin.  And best of all -- <br />I LOVE CHEESE!<br />I recommend this book to anyone who has found him or herself in my situation.	2003-11-04

In between, the book seems to get heavier and heavier with every page you turn, in ironic symmetry with the title (and the cover art).  Lifting the book over your head is a terrible struggle, but it's worth it if you have done some working out, and have had a few of those carbo-loading carrot-and-celery drinks.<br />Reading this book at the beach can lead to very deep sunburn, if you do it in one sitting, although if you defy convention and assert the primacy of your individuality in order to get the sunburn, then it's OK.  Even if nobody's looking.<br />Real Ayn Rand fans know to look for the secret messages embedded in the text every fortieth page (starting with page 6).  If you gather together these messages and decode them properly, they reveal some amazing insights of Objectivist thinking, and likewise form a much more exciting novel than &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;<br />For all its charms, though, I still find this novel less readable than Wittgenstein's &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.&quot;	2003-10-31

As the author attests, it's a proven fact: there is a coterie of completely evil gremlins out to destroy the United States and enslave it under the vicious domination of a vast team of hellhounds sent by the devil to destroy all that is good and pure in the world.  Some of the so-called &quot;people&quot; who are part of this team: clearly Barbra Streisand, Ann Richards, Michael Dukakis, Arthur Schlesinger, Phil J. Kirby (you don't know him), Ted Kennedy.  These are completely inhuman people who must be crushed like bugs, and I'm glad that someone has finally recognized the difference between good people, who deserve our compassion, and massively horrible hell-demons from the black depths whose humanity must only be mocked.  It makes me feel good about our public discourse.  Things are looking up.	2003-10-27

It compares with the work of Jacques Barzun in its sheer mastery of detail, its moving portraits of historical figures who have changed the lives of real people through their dedication to public service, and its overarching kindness.  When I read &quot;Treason,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;There is still hope that people of different backgrounds can come together and find communion.&quot;  Although I was smoking a lot of grass at the time, and was naked, and had just finished a sandwich, and was flipping back and forth between &quot;Treason&quot; and &quot;Naked Lunch,&quot; I still found Ms. Coulter's arguments life-affirming, essentially decent, and--above all--responsible, in that they establish a legacy of honorable discourse and humane public spirit for our children and grandchildren to follow.	2003-10-26

Hannity locates freedom in the food we eat, the lives we build, the messages we pass on to our kids.  The book is  a suprising, but welcome, testimonial, bearing witness to the value of intimacy.

More importantly, can it really be said without using the letter &quot;P&quot; quite so much?<br />Readers who are interested in this subject matter may want to investigate some of the later works of Sean Hannity and Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose treatises on language and morality used a much richer selection of hard consonants.	2003-10-26
