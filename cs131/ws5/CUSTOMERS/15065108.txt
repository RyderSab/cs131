David Lee Roth was part of one of the biggest rock and roll bands on the planet.  This book could have been filled with tour insights, discussions on how the Van Halen and Roth's life since leaving the band have played out, etc.<br />Instead what the reader gets is scattering of Dave's thoughts on life, Van Halen, post Van Halen, and what it is like being Jewish.  All of it is written in this scattered prose that clearly indicates Roth has done way too many drugs.  There is no cohesive story line here, nothing to suggest that Roth put any thought into reading this book other than jotting down whatever jumped into his head.<br />And the arrogance of the novel is outstanding.  As Roth tells it, he and he alone is responsible for the success of Van Halen.  It's almost as if the rest of the band just rode his coat-tails to success and they should all be groveling at his feet thanking him for it.<br />I was also disappointed at the lack of room given to Steve Vai.  Vai in his own right is a great guitarist and it would be have been interesting to see who he and Roth managed to get along for two alums.<br />Do yourself a favour and skip this book.  Life is too short to waste.	2005-07-31

There is a serial killer out there, hunting down unsuspecting travelers.  And since the murders occur away from the western world, there is a tendency for the killer to get away with it.  Sounds good enough right?<br />Well yes and no.<br />The descriptions of life on the trail, the attention to detail of life in the third world, etc. is all done very well.  It is obvious that the author has done his share of traveling.  But when it comes to crafting a mystery novel, once which keeps the reader guessing and wanting to read more, the author falls short.  The protagonist is able to 'solve' the mystery of who the serial killer is in record time, and he does so in an almost elementary fashion.<br />If you are looking for a light read that captures what it is like to travel to third world countries, then this book might interest you.  But if you are looking for a mystery novel with lots of twists and turns, you're better off leaving this book on the shelf.	2005-07-11

I figured if a book on punctuation could be a number one best seller, then I should probably give it a read; and I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.<br />The author does a great job of writing about punctuation and explaining why certain things (like the missing comma in Two Weeks Notice) drive her batty.  Batty to the point of advocating those legions of punctuation devotees get themselves sets of commas and apostrophes, and enter into the world to rid it of all the bad grammar that is taking place out there.<br />For anyone who has been annoyed to see things spelt incorrectly or witnessed first hand the poor use of grammar that gets put on street signs and advertisement,  this book is definitely up your alley.  And for those of us, like me, who just want a good comical read this book is definitely a must have too.	2005-06-21

Mo Hayer does a fantastic job of incorporating actual historic events with authentic locations in Japan, and tying them all together with a story line that just keep giving and giving until the final chapter.<br />The book focuses on the main protagonist, Grey, and her research in to the atrocities that Japan inflicted on China in 1937.  The story, which starts out with a historical tone, quickly changes gears and lets the reader embrace the history and culture of modern day Japan, while somehow always managing to bring the reader back to those historic times in 1937.<br />Although I would like to say more about this novel, I really don't want to give too much away.  The plot is just that good.  Pick this book up.  You will NOT be disappointed.	2005-06-21

Everything, from the action sequences to the behind the scenes conspiracy, right down to the ending of the book screamed &quot;Make me into a movie!&quot;  And that's a shame too, because if Dan Brown had spent a little more time in flushing out some of the plot holes in the book (and there are many) he could have developed another stellar novel.  Instead, you're left with a novel which could just as easily have been written by Michael Crichton or John Grisham.<br />The premise of the novel is straight forward enough.  A fantastic discovery takes place in the arctic and through the course of scientific validation, the main protagonists get drawn into a tightly woven conspiracy.  This is formulaic novel material and Dan Brown manages to pull it off with the best off them.  And although his scientific and military descriptions are authentic enough, his story presents itself with too much flash and not enough substance for the reader to suspend any of their disbelief.<br />And this later point, about the suspension of disbelief, is what makes Brown's other novel The Da Vinci Code such a great read.  Try as he might, Brown just cannot replicate the mystery that he managed to do with is previous outting.<br />I don't want to spoil the book so I'll refrain from saying anything else at this point.  However if you are reading this book in hopes of a Da Vinci Code part II, you will be sadly disapointed.  But if you like quick reads that don't involve a lot of thinking to be done on the part of the reader, then this book is for you.	2005-05-24

His description of the how the protagonist feels is written in such a manner that everyone, regardless of their background, will be able to relatee to.<br />I also enjoyed how Coupland was able to write about the interplay between family members.  In reading the interactions between the main character and her mother, sister, and brother, each conversation felt as though it could actually have taken place.  These are not phoney characters, designed simply to advance the plot.  Rather they come across as real people with feelings and emotions.<br />In the words of Siskel and Ebert, I give this novel two thumbs up.	2005-05-24

Maybe this book wasn't written for people like me because after reading some of the reviews here, and even in speaking with some, everyone seems to speak highly of Carl Hiaasen.  But me, I wish I could have the week's worth of evenings back that I spent reading this book.<br />Simply put, I didn't find the book funny.  For someone who is supposed to be an author who writes with humour, I had a hard time laughing at anything in this book.  And the characters?  It is really heard to believe that anyone in the world is as simple-minded as the characters he writes about.<br />Now I know this is supposed to be fiction.  And I know that because it is fiction, I should give the author a bit of leeway.  But even so.  I've read countless other fictional books and each one of those the author has managed to convey real characters.  So why couldn't Hiaasen manage to do it here?  And this really is too bad too, because the underlying plot (bad guy dumping chemicals into an environmentally sensitive area and trying to cheat the system) is a good one.  I just wish Hiaasen had managed to do more with it.<br />Suffice to say this is my first and last Hiaasen book.	2005-05-08

Thankfully though I ended up having a business trip with nothing else to read but a copy of this book, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is.<br />This is a mystery novel, written and narrated by the detective who is going to solve the crime.  Only the detective isn't a police detective, but a 17 year old man.  And what's more, this man has autism.  This later fact makes for great reading, because it allows the author to put a very unique perspective on his story and words.<br />I must commend Mark Hadden for a very well written and descriptive book.  Although one might think that reading a book written from an autistic perspective would be difficult to understand, quite the opposite is true.  The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time flows quite well from chapter to chapter, and at no time is the reader left wondering what's going on.<br />This is a good novel and one that I should have read a long time ago.	2005-04-25

Jon Krakauer, probably best known for this book Into Thin Air, does an excellent job of presenting a well documented and well researched book focusing around the Mormon faith.  And while it would have been easy to turn the book into a text filled with educational ramblings, Krakauer managers to convey the thoughts and ideas about the history of Mormonism in an easy to read novel.<br />The book is written around two members of the fundamentalist off-shoot of the Church of Latter-Day Saints and their involvement with a murder in July, 1984.  Krakauer manages to weave a deft history of Mormonism into what would normally be a standard news clip on the 6pm news, by presenting the full history Mormon faith.  His writing also touches on the individuals that have been responsible for leading the church and its followers, and Krakauer goes to come length to identify why followers empathize with their leaders charisma.<br />I found this book to be a very entertaining read, and I managed to get through the entire 400 page book in just over one week.  For anyone who has an interest in religion, the settling of the American West, and true life murders, then thiis book is one you shouldn't miss.	2005-04-24

Why this book?  Because Nick Hornby, the author, does a great job of capturing the struggle that some men go through as they move between that awkward stage of wanting to play games and never settle down, vs. the desire to get into serious relationships and start that nesting phase of life.<br />Now while this might seem like a touchy-feely novel, it isn't.  Hornby deftly stick handles through what might be a dangerous topic only to cover the subject with humour and excellent observations.  And while at first glance this might novel appear to be target to men only, women should find an interest in this novel too, as it provides a good glimpse in to how men think and operate.<br />This book most definitely rates five stars for having human and believable characters, a story line that everyone no matter their age or sex or race can follow, and a writing style that is easy to read.  Never mind the many references to cool bands and the great music scene found in London.<br />Even if you saw the movie, you should still pick up the book and give it a read.  The novel does a much better job of capturing the struggle experienced by the protagonist, and better still, the novel is set in London rather than the movie locale of Chicago.  For anyone looking for their first Nick Hornby novel, this would be the one to give them.	2005-04-24

Krakauer's first hand account of the Mt. Everest tragedy which claimed the lives of serveral mountain guides and their clients is a riveting tale of man against nature.  It is also a cautionary tale of just how things can go wrong when the proper warning signs are not heeded.<br />On the whole, this book is well written.  Krakauer's writing style is such that it easy to start reading this book and forget that you have a non-fiction book in your hands.	2005-04-24

All I knew was that I wanted to read a book which dealt with computer hackers and this book had been recommended to me by a friend of mine.  Suffice to say I was not disappointed.<br />Littman writes a compelling story about Kevin Poulson, who is perhaps the second best known hacker in North America best Kevin Mitnick.  And what makes this book such an interesting read is that it is a modern day, and real life, version of the Fugitive.  But unlike the Fugitive, Kevin is hunted to tapping in to phone systems and learning much more about the telephone networks than the average, non-telco employee, should be allowed to.<br />The book is filled with first hand accounts and funny anecdotes of the escapades that Kevin and some of his company managed to pull off.  After reading the book, I was left scratching my head in disbelief.  It was almost as if the feats Kevin was able to accomplish were too good to be true.  But in the end, that's what makes this book so great.	2005-04-24

Keithley gives a fantastic first hand account of how he formed his band and all of the tests they endured going from relative nobodies to one of the biggest and best known punk bands in North America.<br />The book is also a mini how-to manual for anyone interested in starting up their own punk band.  Keithley talks about the business side of the music industry, what it's like to play gigs to crowds of different sizes and interests, and above all, he gives a great first hand account of just what it takes to make it in the music business.<br />Finally, Keithley's writing style is very easy to digest.  The book is written like the lyrics to many of his songs; straight ahead without and BS!  What's more, the book contains many pictures and personal anecdotes about Vancouver and places beyond.  In reading the book it easy to see yourself sitting at a bar with Keithley as he tells a couple tales over a couple of beers.<br />If you're a punk, or even think about calling yourself a punk, then you owe it to yourself to give this book a read.	2005-04-17

Thus I picked up the book blind, having no idea who the author was nor what the premise of the included.  Having just finished the book I can honestly say I was not disappointed.<br />Waters manages to capture the sights and sounds of Victorian England quite well. Details are richly rendered, and each character is developed such that the reader feels like they can almost reach out and touch them.  Progressing through the book, the reader is left with a very different impression of what Victorian England might have looked like, as say compared to how Dickens's might have portrayed it.<br />Waters also does a fantastic job of keeping the reader on edge.  Plot turns and twists ensure that this is one book the reader will not want to put down.  Anyone who is interested in books centered around Victorian England, and/or who like books where the unexpected is almost the expected, should definitely give this book a read.	2005-04-17

This is a good book.  Why?  Because it gives the reader a good look at the inside of the recording industry.  The author paints a picture of just how hard it is to get a record from concept to the store shelves, and all of the business mumbo-jumbo that must be dealt with in-between.  And what really opened my eyes in reading this book, was just how much of money the record companies take back from the artists.  The amount was staggering really.<br />Another reason why this is a good book is because of the writing style.  Slichter does a good job of conveying the fact that he's just an ordinary average Joe, who happens to have been lucky enough to be with the right group of guys, to form a band that was, for the most part, well received.  Unlike some other rock-ographies out there, this book is not full of self serving gratification.<br />So where does the book fall down?  Primarily in the area of self introspection.  Slichter does a good job of explaining why their most recent album didn't sell well, but there is no admission on his part that maybe, just maybe, it wasn't the fault the record company for the record not selling.  And instead, perhaps the album wasn't as good as the band thought, and hence the lack of airplay.<br />This minor point aside, this is a very well written and insightful good book.	2005-04-14

The part of the book where Simmons talks about what goes into creating and sustaining one of the world's greatest and most popular rock and roll bands makes for good reading.  Anyone who has followed Kiss over the decades knows there have been personnel changes and background squabbles.  Simmons does a good job of writing about the squabbles and explaining why certain things were handled in a particular matter.<br />However the book fails to go from good to great because of Simmon's own egotism.  In reading the book, I couldn't help but feel that I should be bowing down to ground before him, thanking Simmons for creating this band and permitting me listen to his wonderful music.  After a while of reading this &quot;I'm great&quot; mantra, the whole notion begins to get a little tedious.<br />An additional point of interest is the lack of discussions about Paul Stanley.  Simmons states that he and Stanley created the band and made all band decisions together, but really does not provide any details into their relationship.  There is plenty of information on other band members, but very little about Stanley.  As to why, this is anyone's guess.<br />Kiss and Make-up is a decent enough read.  If you were a member of the Kiss Army, chances are you already know everything that's already in the book.  But if you were/are a passing admirer of the music, then this book will give you a good insider's look at what made the band members tick.	2005-04-14

In a nut shell, this true life story is about Joe Simpson and the troubles he endured while mountaineering in Peruvian Andes.  What makes the story so gripping is that this was no up the mountain; down the mountain story.  Instead Joe takes us on a wild ride into his psyche as he encounters a few problems along the way, and how he manages to deal with them in a calm, cool, collected manner.<br />Even though this book has been making the rounds in the rock climbing/mountaineering scene for years now, everyone, regardless of their backgrounds should give this book a read.  It is a testament to the human spirit, as well as a never give up attitude.  At the end of the book, all you'll be able to say is 'wow'.	2005-04-09

And although one might thing a story about a storm might be kind of dull, the storm is really the main character of the book.  Every detail on what goes into turning your average run-of-the-mill storm into a 'perfect' storm is well researched and well written.  And perhaps most importantly, it is written in such a manner so that the average read isn't lost in a lot of scientific talk.<br />No matter what your background is, if weather is something that interests you, and on some levels weather and its causes and effects interests everyone, this book is worthwhile reading.	2005-04-09

On the one hand, I am duly impressed that these students managed to take the 'big houses' of Vegas for as much money as they did.  On the other hand, I found it very hard to get over the author worshipping at the alter of MIT.  And by this I mean that the author took every opportunity to let you know that these weren't just any students who took Vegas for millions, they were MIT students.<br />My beef with the author's love of MIT aside, the premise of this book is fascinating.  To learn or hear of people, in this day and age, being able to make bucket loads in the Vegas casinos, is fascinating.  What's more, the author presents the story in such a fashion that it is almost part story, part 20/20 documentary.  He (the author) does a nice job of explaining to you exactly how the students managed to make all of their money from the casinos, while at the same time sprinkling enough information in each chapter to keep the reader interested to find out if the protagonists will make it rich, or get caught in the process.<br />Everyone gambles.  But it is only a few lucky people who have learned to gamble well and make money.  And if you're interested in getting a glimpse into the lives of those who do gamble for the big bucks, then this book is for you.	2005-04-06

The plot is timely, the concept believable, and there is just enough of a hook left at the end of each chapter to pull the reader through the novel.  What the author has going for him, is that he has experience in working in the medical community.  His descriptions of what needs to be done in the face of a 'pandemic' ring true.<br />Did the book follow a formulaic plot?  Of course it did.  Will the book sell well?  Of course it will?  And will we be seeing Tom Hanks and Rene Zellwiger as co-leads in the movie adaptation?  Well, that has yet to be seen.  But from the style the book is written in, it does have Hollywood written all over it.<br />Nevertheless, this is the author's first novel.  And for someone who is not an author by trade, but rather an ER doctor at a hospital in Toronto, Canada, he has written a very cohesive and exciting book.  For anyone interested in a 'what if' scenario, especially one involving bio-terrorism, then this is the novel for you.	2005-04-06

And when I was finished reading, all I could think of was &quot;why couldn't I have ever found a submarine when I was scuba diving???&quot;  And then I'd start thinking to myself that I should drag the tanks out of storage and get diving again.  As books go, this one is well rounded.  Great characters, a great plot (I mean who doesn't get excited about history coming back to life), and a story that the common man can relate to.<br />My only gripe with the book - the title.  Was it really necessary to include the nationalities of the divers who found the wreck?  The divers country of origin really has no bearing on the fact of who found the wreck, nor their personal experiences.<br />That small gripe aside, I whole heartedly recommend this book.  In fact I don't think I've read an underwater tale this good since 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea!	2005-03-31

Stories would always surface about how they were wild party animals, how there would be women all over them, and how there would be drugs and booze a-plenty.  Of course I always figured this just to be rumours, told by mothers to scare their children into being straight A students, and wishful thinking on the part of me and my friends.<br />But after reading this book, which is written in a very unique style by having a member from the band each write a chapter, I can tell you that everything you heard, or everything you thought you heard about the band, is true.  This book does a nice job of letting the reader into the 'inner sanctum' of the band.  Through reading what the band members have to say, it's easy to see why they ended up breaking up like they did.  Yet at the same time it was one hell of a ride.<br />Definitely pick this book up if you're a) interested in Motley Crue, b) interested in what it's like to be in a world famous rock band or c) interested in finding out how too much alcohol and too many drugs can ruin a good thing.	2005-03-30

I took it out of the library b/c it had won the Govenor General's Award, so I figured it had to be good.  Boy was I ever wrong!<br />This book is dull.  It is s-l-o-w moving from start to finish and it is written in this slang type speech (which I suppose was common for the age but) which makes it very difficult to read.  So put all of these issues in a blender and you have one horrible book/story.<br />Avoid this book like the plague.	2005-03-23

It was well written, and did a good job of holding my attention chapter after chapter.  Similiar in writing style to Larson's other novel 'Devil in the White City' (which should come as no surprise, as that novel was written after this one) Larson dishes out bits of information in each chapter, giving the reader just enough tid bits to ensure they'll keep coming back for more.<br />In addition to providing bits about the people who were present when the storm hit Galveston, Larson has also done a great job of tracking the storms trajectory.  He's been able to write what the meteorologists at the time thought of the storm, contrasting it with what we now know about storm morphology.  The combination of history, storm knowledge, and the perception of storms in the 1900s, all play well together.<br />While one might think a book about a hurricane, hitting the Texas coastline in 1900 would be a dull read, the opposite is infact the case.  The story encourages the reader to turn the page and find out how everyone faired once the storm had subsided, and what the over-all impacts were to the US weather service, who had failed to accurately guage the storm's capacity.	2005-03-22
US	15065108	RHOPZ2KYDU3KJ	0345417623	786105285	Timeline	Books	2	9	9	N	N	Stolen Ideas and Written for Hollywood	I don't quite know when Michael Crichton's writing style started to do downhill.  Perhaps he's spending too much time working on ER, or maybe he is too busy living off the proceeds of the many Jurassic Park movies.  But whatever the case is, Timeline is not one of his better efforts.<br />My main beef with the story is that it is a complete rip off of Connie Willis's Doomsday Book and her second novel To Say Nothing of the Dog.  Why do I say this?  Because both novels deal with students, both novels deal with time travel, both novels deal with time travel for educational purposes, and both novels del with some sort of crisis taking place to the student while they are in the past.  The only different between the two books is that that Willis writes a much more believable and compelling story.<br />The characters of this books felt completely fake and unbelievable.  I had a hard time feeling sympathy for any of them, and the whole time I was reading the story I kept getting the feeling that Crichton had written the characters specifically for Hollywood casting.  It was almost as if Crichton sacrified character development in favour of letting Hollywood cast Tom Hanks (or whomever) as the lead and let Hanks' own persona define the character.<br />Overall, my advice is to avoid this book. The time description of the time travel feels weak, the character development is weak, and the whole premise on why the students need to travel back in time is weak.  My advice?  If you want to read a good time travel book give Connie Willis's novels a go.  She's the original in this field and her novels are MUCH better.	2005-03-21

The notion of someone experiencing an internal time flux, and traveling back and forth in time, should have interested me.  The problem is, after about 200 pages, I lost interest in this novel and it was a real struggle to finish.<br />Why?<br />First off, to me it was always the same problem over and over again.  The main protagonist would travel in time, meet up with his lover, experience some sort of trauma or activity with her, then travel back to the present.  Repeat this action for 500+ pages, and it starts to be a bit monotonous.<br />Where's the action?  Where's the drama?  Where's the activity that's going to keep my interest for the full extent of the book?<br />My other main issue with the book is that that the female protagonist is so obviously based on the author.  Although many people write from their own perspectives and personal experiences, I would have liked to see the author build on her fictional account of time travel and create a unique female lead.<br />The good?  Niffenegger does a great job of dealing with time travel and the problems one would expect to encounter.  I won't say much more on the chance that I ruin the book for others, but suffice to say I did like this aspect of the book.<br />Overall though, I was disappointed.	2005-03-21

The premise, in which students travel in time to learn about history, is unique and extremely well handled by Willis.  The descriptions she uses to describe the time travel mechanism, and the 'rules' in place to prevent the alteration of the time line, are also well done.  In the past I've always felt that time travel was poorly handled by authors.  They either left too many gaps, or made the system so overly complex that I found myself spending more time thinking about how impossible the time travel was and less time on the 'meat' of the story.  Thankfully, this story has none of these inadequacies.<br />I especially liked the characters.  Each one was well written, and presented in a believable manner.  I think an author does a good job of writing a book when they make you, the reader, want to meet the individual they have written about in person.  Willis, in my opinion, achieves this.<br />And finally, the descriptions Willis manages to convey with regards to the 14th century make one think that she was actually there herself!  For anyone interested in historical fiction, or has a passing interest in time travel (with a bit of humor thrown in) I'd say this book's for you.	2005-03-21
US	15065108	R1JOP3QTIBHLNV	0375725601	517121775	The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	5	3	6	N	N	This book was awesome!	So why did I like this book so much?  First off, the writing style is gripping.  The author flips between the life of the serial killer in one chapter, and then in the next, the author is busy talking about the Chicago fair.  This back and forth action between the two divergent locales kept me turning the page to find out what was going to happen next.<br />Another thing I really liked about this story is the fact that the author did a nice of building the suspense.  For example as the fair is being built, there is a big debate as to what the main attraction will be.  After many debates, someone steps forward with an idea, which is unanimously accepted by all of the fair planners.  But what Erik Larson does so well, is that he keeps you hooked.  He doesn't reveal what the big attraction is until three or four chapters later.<br />The combination of the real life struggle enountered by the city fair planners, and juxtaposed against the killings that were taking place at the same time, and the gruesomeness of those killings, made this a book that was very hard for me to put down.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in real life crime and/or historial novels.	2005-03-20
