It was written in the mid-5th century.  The Armenians had been converted to Christianity in the previous generation, but the Persian emperor was now attempting to convert them by force to a version of state Zoroastrianism, known as Zurvanism.  Eznik wrote as part of the ideological counter, in four books.  The first dealt with the nature of God, followed by books refuting Zurvanism, Greek paganism, and finally and most interestingly, the second century Marcionite heresy. <br /> <br />Thomas Samuelian has retold the work in order to make it accessible to those encountering it for the first time.  This makes it less useful than the straight translation published since of the single manuscript, but much easier to read!  Indeed Dr Samuelian's version makes it clear that Eznik is addressing concerns of interest today, and is not merely of antiquarian interest. <br /> <br />The text is lively, clear, and intended to bring Eznik to a new audience.  This it does.	2005-06-04

This translation, originally made in 1958 by Gleason L. Archer, is of a commentary made by St. Jerome ca. 417 AD, towards the end of his life.  The book of Daniel attracts a fair number of cranks and people interested in biblical number-crunching; all of them should find Jerome's comments of interest.  There is also considerable historical interest in Jerome's identification of the various Hellenistic parties mentioned in Daniel.  The book is mainly aimed at resolving what used to be quaintly called 'bible difficulties', so should still be useful. <br /> <br />The presentation is rather rough.  Only three footnotes are present -- after that Archer simply put his footnotes in the text in square brackets. <br /> <br />The text translated is the Patrologia Latina text of J.-P. Migne, from 1844-ish.  Archer has also translated Migne's footnotes.  The text is a pre-critical text, which is unfortunate.  At the time Archer worked, the modern Corpus Christianorum text did not exist.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, it is a very useful text.  It would be useful to have all the ancient biblical commentaries in English.  So often, I sense, we stumble over things that any ancient reader would have laughed at.	2005-02-21

In antiquity, this was not a simple matter, for there was no universal system like AD and BC, nor agreement as to when the year started, nor on the months in use.  Ancient chronographers listed the names of kings, and the number of years for which they reigned, and might mention some event that occurred 'in the 4th year of king XYZ.'  Since there were many series of such monarchs in cities and kingdoms, this was not much help.<br /><br />In 313AD Eusebius Pamphili, Bishop of Caesarea, made a critical breakthrough.  He invented a format for a chronicle in which he laid out multiple vertical columns of rulers, tied together by syncronisms at various points.  It ran from the first date he thought he could have any real chance of dating, the birth of Abraham, down to 313, later 326AD.  This meant that for any year it was possible to see who was doing what.  Into it he processed all the mass of material that existed in the Greek chronographic tradition.  His format meant both that he could use material from any list of rulers, and that he could detect errors.<br /><br />His chronicle fell on relatively stony ground in the Greek world; only an Armenian translation of a form revised (and corrupted) exists. But a copy came into the hands of St. Jerome, who translated it into Latin, added material from the West, and thereby laid the foundations for all subsequent chronicles.  In the Latin form, over 100 manuscripts exist, some from the 5th century.<br /><br />All this is explained by Mosshammer in a marvellous manner.  It is clear, it is detailed, it is well-referenced.  Mosshammer disentangles the remains of the chronicle in its various versions, and lays the results out clearly.  He includes monochrome photographs from the 5th century Bodleian Library manuscript, which allows us to see the innovative format.<br /><br />The history of the various printed editions is exceedingly complex.  Here again Mosshammer is simply an incredibly useful resource.  It is almost impossible for the layman to make sense of the manner in which the various editions, past and present, Armenian, German, Latin, and Syriac, interrelate.  Worse still, older editions have been republished while better editions have not.  Mosshammer guides the reader through them all.  Indeed it is the only guide known to me in English, and quite indispensable.<br /><br />The second portion of the book takes various events, recorded in the various versions of the chronicle, and discusses how they come to be, which is correct, and how the reading derives (which it usually does) from one strand or another of the pre-existing mass of material.  Some 12 cases are examined in detail.  The results are really for specialists, but are certainly very well done.<br /><br />It is hard to see how a book of this kind could have been improved within its lengthy compass.  Armed with it, the newcomer to Eusebius-Jerome can chart his own course.ammer is simply an incredibly useful resource.

But in fact it contains only a portion of the text.  Jerome translated the Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea, which ran from the birth of Abraham in the 15th dynasty, down to the vicennalia of Constantine in 326AD.  He added his own preface, filled in a few gaps where Eusebius had been ignorant of events in the Latin West, and also brought it up to date, adding entries of his own composition down to the death of Valens in 379AD.  It is this last portion ---- from the end of the translation of Eusebius' work to the end of the chronicle ---- that is included in this work. <br /> <br />This is a great pity.  No translation of the whole Chronicle exists in English.  However, the editor has done us a service by translating the last portion, and giving references for each year to the details in other ancient texts such as Eutropius and Aurelius Victor.  It is good as far as it goes; I just wish it did more.  A photocopy of the Latin text from the Griechische Christlicher Schriftsteller series is appended.	2004-10-08

Shame on you, Routledge, for this. <br /> <br />The prefaces are really useful and provide an up-to-date overview of anglophone thinking on Tertullian.

In addition there are scanty references to the cult in the Christian fathers, and a handful of other references.  The cult was a mystery religion, and its beliefs and rituals must be inferred from this scanty base.  Wild theorisings are unfortunately common.<br /><br />The entire data base then known was published in the early 20th century by Franz Cumont.  (An English language version of his conclusions is still available).  He believed Mithras to be an importation of the ancient Persian deity Mitra, doubtless influenced by descriptions of Mithras as Persian.  His work remained standard until the 1970's.  Since then many theories have been published -- those of David Ulansey perhaps have attracted much attention.<br /><br />This book by Manfred Clauss is a careful piece of scholarship, that will be of great use to the newcomer to Mithras studies.  He believes the cult was invented in Rome itself, and points out that the 3 earliest inscriptions and the first literary mention, all ca. AD90, are indisputably by people with close links to the city of Rome.  The story is taken through various aspects of the cult, as illustrated from the monuments and whatever literary information is available.  Parallels with Christian practise are mentioned, but Clauss dismisses the idea of influence in either direction, preferring to point out the shared heritage of oriental religion in classical times.  He highlights the close relation of Mithraism with other mystery religions, and rightly is sceptical about the idea that Mithraism always involved believing the same things.  Regional and temporal variants are documented.<br /><br />In short, no better introduction to the subject could be devised.  Richard Gordon's translation is excellent -- no hint of another language underlying it comes through --, and his choice of translations for ancient texts likewise.<br /><br />The only thing that I missed was a list of all the ancient literary sources, or indication of where to find these.  The illustrations are far better chosen than those of Cumont.  In short, the book is a gem.	2004-01-08
US	49773108	R2UWQJMW2GGZ9I	0486203239	322478029	The Mysteries of Mithra	Books	2	32	39	N	N	A classic in its time, but outdated	A century ago, Franz Cumont gathered together all the primary evidence about Mithraism: mentions in literary texts, inscriptions, sculptures, coins, excavated Mithraea.  This he published in French in two volumes, \\"Textes et monuments figures relatifs aux mysteres de Mithra\\" (Brussels: Lamartin, 1896-9).  This book is the English language translation of his conclusions from that evidence, not the evidence itself.  It is thus very light on footnotes, and the quality of the drawn illustrations is not great, even in the original.<br /><br />Cumont believed that the Roman cult of Mithras was derived from the ancient Persian worship of Ahura-Mazda, or Mithra, and identical to it.  He was led to this view by mentions of Persia in connection with the cult, although since 'the Persian' was one of the stages of initiation, this is not necessarily so.  Since about 1970, scholars have rejected this view, and felt that Mithras is a Graeco-Roman god, of a standard mystery-religion type, which only nods to Persian practises.<br /><br />A better book to read is Manfred Clauss, The Roman Cult of Mithras.  This summary of Cumont is now only of historical interest.	2004-01-08

His suggestion that the cult arose in Cicilia, as a product of new astrological discoveries grafted onto the existing cult of Perseus, is most interesting, and very well argued.  The book is quite readable, and as a statement of a position works well.  Like most modern scholars, he discards Cumont's theory that the Persian deity Mitra is the same as Mithras.  The cult must have been devised, in his view, some time around 70 BC, based on the statement in Plutarch, \\"Pompey\\", that the Cicilian pirates were devoted to Mithras.<br /><br />However I came away feeling that he had started with a theory, around which the evidence was moulded.  In one or two places, I felt that the narrative adopted the tricks of the Von Daniken school, whereby a problem is raised purely in order to introduce a pre-determined solution, giving the reader a quite fallacious feeling of 'investigation.'  Surely the story should arise naturally from the data, not be imposed on it?<br /><br />The book presumes a general familiarity with the evidence for Mithraism, and so would not be the best book to start with.  A better starting point would be Manfred Clauss, \\"The Roman Cult of Mithras.\\"  This suggests that the cult originated in Rome in the first century AD.  Cumont's book -- the conclusions from his magisterial survey of all the data translated into English -- is now out of date.  After reading Clauss, then one might read both Ulansey and Cumont.	2004-01-08

He also translated two works of Tertullian into French, and was a friend of Montaigne.  He died in 1601, and was described as 'a very great man' and his works circulated very widely in the succeeding century.  The expulsion of the Huguenots brought an end to the controversy, and his works became outdated and out of fashion.  Thereafter he was forgotten.    These simple details the reader is led to infer from Tinsley's book, which is badly organised and edited.  A characteristic passage is the end of chapter 1 -- which describes Raemond's life in brief -- when his death is mentioned, without any mention of the *date*.  The reader must scrabble around to find this minor detail (!) elsewhere.  This sort of thing -- allusiveness to the raw facts -- happens throughout the book and makes it weary reading.  For this the publisher must take the blame.  Had the book been handed to any normal person to read, they would have highlighted the organisational problem at once.  No doubt Dr. Tinsley had simply spent too much time with Raemond to remember that the rest of us needed a clearer picture of the data: but publishers should catch this.    This greatly mars the book, since the raw facts are what we read it for.  There is much interesting information in the work, and Raemond is treated sympathetically.  Tinsely wisely resists the urge to pillory the man for the faults of his age, and writes to encourage interest and understanding.  I noted only one passage which made me wary of possible political correctness, which is very welcome in a modern US academic publication.  In general, the work can be read by normal people without feeling insulted or lectured.  The presence of a useful portrait of Raemond is very welcome.    This could have been so much bettera book.  Perhaps if Dr. Tinsley does a second edition, it could yet be.	2003-12-05

The reprint is very reasonably priced, and the book runs to 300 pages.  General appearance is good, but the typeface is of course old-fashioned.<br /><br />The author, W. Wright, made a huge contribution to Syriac Studies and was a figure of much interest himself.  As a young man, he was involved in unmasking the forger Simonides who claimed to have written the biblical Codex Sinaiticus himself.<br /><br />The book is very difficult indeed to read, because the whole book is a single chapter!  A patrology would normally be divided into sections, author by author.  However the genesis of the book as an article in the Encyclopedia Britannica has meant that the text had to be continuous, and regrettably this was not corrected in the book version.<br /><br />The single-chapter format also blurs the distinctions between writers.  The spelling of names is erratic, and seems to be designed to obscure those figures that a well-educated man might otherwise recognise.<br /><br />Even if you are interested in Syriac literature -- Wright admits that mediocrity is the keynote of this -- this book is very hard going.  The style is turgid at best: again handicapped by the format.  It is, of course, very out of date.<br /><br />So why did I buy a copy?  Well, how many introductions to Syriac literature are there?  Not many, that is for sure!  It is essential reading.  I was also pleased to discover in its pages a reference to a probably forgotten out of copyright English translation of one work.<br /><br />In short, it is high time that a much better book, structured along the lines of Quasten's Patrology, replaced this.  But even then, I suspect it will continue to be read.  Even a version of Wright broken into sections would be an improvement.  No doubt more modern books do exist,but amateurs like myself do not come across them.	2003-10-08

This, to put it mildly, is not the stuff of scholarship!  He used a small selection of works, together with older literature such as Robert Taylor's \\"Diegesis\\", as sources.    In such an enterprise, accurate citation is everything.  Unfortunately, those who verify his quotes come away with a feeling of discomfort.    Firstly, they are often verbally correct.  However, it is not uncommon for him to practise the lawyers' trick of deceit by selection.  In a number of cases, he stops quoting, just before a sentence which explicitly denies the suggestion he wishes  his readers to suppose the father (or whoever) is giving.      An examination of the introduction gives some 25 citations from the fathers or the Catholic Encyclopeda.  I looked all of these up, as the CE and the Ante-Nicene fathers are all online these days.    28% of the references are wrong; 28% are inaccurate or otherwise can't be checked from his reference; and only 24% of the quotes correctly represent the author's views!  In the latter case, few of these really support his thesis.    He abuses St. Augustine, for instance as credulous -- but has not noticed that the 'quotes' he gives are not by this author, but from a medieval piece of narrative fiction.    If someone writes a book to prove his neighbour a liar, it is an absolute requirement to be 100% accurate himself, and to be give the victim the benefit of any doubt.  Otherwise, the work is a piece of hate-literature.  But Wheless distorts and misleads, relying on the inaccessibility of the sources he uses, in the pre-internet era, in order to abuse his neighbour.    Most atheists today are aware that Wheless cannot be trusted where facts are concerned.  This book highlights the dangers of uncritical acceptance of theories, simply because they are congenial.  Avoid, unless you are willing to verify everything yourself.	2003-07-11

The 1905 classic \\"La theologie de Tertullien\\" by D'Ales has never had an English equivalent -- indeed Roberts in 1924 was able to write his less than useful book without even referencing D'Ales. So it is exciting to come across a book, however curiously named, which addresses itself to the subject.<br /><br />The book is copiously annotated.  Indeed I found it very useful as a guide to publications on aspects of Tertullian's theology.  For instance, three pages are devoted to the famous 'credo quia absurdum', in which Kearsley summarises 3 ways to look at this, with references.  This was indeed useful.  Likewise it is possible to dip into the book at points, searching for texts and concepts and find a useful collection of books and articles for further reading, and some sort of digest of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately the book has many serious defects. The first which strikes the reader is the style, which is turgid and unreadable. The book derives from a PhD thesis, and I suspect the process of condensation must bear some of the blame.<br />The second issue that strikes the reader forcibly is that every other sentence seems to be a reference, not to Tertullian, but to the opinion of some modern theological writer about him. (The overwhelming majority of these are anglophone, which is disappointing). This makes the book intensely frustrating to the reader who wants to hear the voice of Tertullian, not that of modern writers about him.<br /><br />For instance, in chapter 2 there is a discussion of why Tertullian placed Athens and Jerusalem in opposition, and what Tertullian thought of 'philosophy'.  It's too condensed, for one thing. Many things might be said about this. But the focus is on modern opinions (all rather uninteresting), not on Tertullian, and I frankly felt that neither the author nor his sources had actually read and enjoyed the first 10 chapters of De praescriptione haereticorum as a living text with something to say, rather than as raw material for his thesis. It is very hard to read Greenslade's excellent version and then regard these pages as useful comment on it.<br /><br />The volume is likewise marred by political correctness of a particularly intrusive kind. Apparently the idea of political authority stemming from the emperor is anathema in the author's circles.  This anachronism is very destructive.  There is much talk of 'rescuing' bits of the Christian gospel (the PC code-word for syncretism), in order to relate them to this PC fad or that.  This is deeply offensive to Christians, and logically nonsensical. Finally the text is stuffed with theological jargon, all of it smelling strongly of the lecture-notes of some salaried and tenured professor of religious studies at some marginal secular university.<br /><br />All of this makes the volume very hard indeed to read, and I found my attention wandering on just about every page. I cannot say that I learnt anything about Tertullian from it. Probably there are some useful insights, if you can get past the obstacles. But I didn't find any. D'Ales is immensely better.<br /><br />The general reader will find T.D.Barnes, \\"Tertullian: A Literary and Historical Study\\" a far better introduction to Tertullian as a whole.  However, it would be unfair to complain that Kearsley does not rival Barnes, as he did not set out to do so.<br /><br />I'm not sure to whom this book can be recommended. It has a certain value as a guide to the literature.	2003-04-05

Had this not appeared, Amidon's work would have been invaluable.  As it is, we are fortunate that two specialists should have attempted this work, which previously had attracted no translator into a modern language.<br /><br />The work may well be useful to those less interested in Epiphanius than in those he detested.	2003-01-30

Niggles and comments are mostly the same.]<br />This is volume 2 of a 2 volume set.  It is around twice the size of vol. 1, and contains 'book 2 and book 3', i.e. heresies 47-80 plus De Fide.<br /><br />Heretics dealt with are: Encratites, Montanists, Quintillianists, Quartodecimans, Alogoi, Adamians, Sampsaeans, Theodotians, Melchizedekians, Bardesanists, Noetians, Valesians, Cathari (Novatianists / Donatists), Angelics, Apostolics, Sabellians, Origenists, Origen Adamantius, Paul of Samosata, Manichaeans, Hieracites, the schism of Meletius, Arians, Audians, Photinians, Marcellians, semi-Arians, Pneumatomachi, Aerius, Anomoeans, Dimoerites (aka Apolinarians), Antidicomarians, Collyridians, Massalians.  The work ends with a statement of the Christian faith (De fide) which also contains some interesting descriptions of contemporary paganism.<br /><br />This is the only complete version in a modern language.  The Latin text in the Patrologia Graeca is said to be of an indifferent standard.  (Amidon's selection apparently consists of the description of the heresy in each case, for all the heresies, plus narrative, but omitting Epiphanius' refutation).<br /><br />As the work gets closer to Epiphanius' own time, his information is increasingly valuable as based on observation or contemporary report.<br /><br />If only it didn't cost so much!	2003-01-30

The work is a set of descriptions of 80 heresies, starting with the philosophers and the Jews and brought down to his own times.  The lengthy descriptions, sometimes based on personal experience, other times on works now lost, are of inestimable value to anyone who wishes to know more detail on the heresies of antiquity.<br /><br />We all owe Mr. Williams quite a debt for making this long and difficult work available.  It is pleasing to see that the work has now gone into its second impression (1997), which suggests that it is selling well for such a scholarly work.  The book is well-made physically and printed on acid-free paper.<br /><br />This is volume 1 of 2, containing just over a third of the whole work, heresies 1-46 of 80.  It deals with:<br />Barbarism, Scythianism, Hellenism, Judaism, Stoicism, Platonists, Pythagoreans, Epicureans, Samaritans, Essenes, Sebuaeans, Gorothenes, Dositheans, Sadduccees, Scribes, Pharisees, Hemerobaptists, Nasaraeans, Ossaeans, Herodians, Simonians, Menander, Satornilus, Basilides, Nicolaitans, Gnostics(Borborites), Carpocratians, Cerinthians, Nazoraeans, Ebionites, Valentinians, Secundians, Ptolemaeans, Marcosians, Colorbasians, Heracleonites, Ophites, Cainites, Sethians, Archontics, Cerdonians, Marcionites, Lucianists, Apelleans, Severians and finally Tatianists (no. 46).<br /><br />The footnotes are helpful, and indicate sources or parallels not only with the fathers but also the coptic gnostic texts in the Nag Hammadi Library.  The editors of that collection are to be commended for their vision in making so essential a work available.<br /><br />Niggles?  For some reason the 'H'-word has proved a stumbling block.  'Heresy' (haeresis) is rendered mainly as 'sect', rather than heresy.  It is unclear who benefits from this, other than persons of heretical views and thin skins!  However mostly the text avoids the biases of the US religious studies establishment, and is much easier for the rest of us to read in consequence.  It would have been  helpful to have running headers that indicated the section in question, and not just the work.  In some cases the translation has an unaccustomed force.  What Greek word is rendered by the frequently encountered epithet, 'scum', I wondered.  No doubt it is in a footnote somewhere, but I couldn't find it.  I'd have liked some discussion of the manuscripts and transmission of the text.  Finally the *price* -- OUCH!<br /><br />But these are all minor points.  The book is a triumph, and a required addition to the shelves of everyone obliged to paddle  in the puddles of these ancient cult-makers.  The book has been often quoted, and misquoted.  Now we can read the whole thing for ourselves.	2003-01-16

The detail in the notes alone makes it worth the purchase, while the discussion of issues in the introduction is masterly.<br /><br />The intellectual integrity of Eusebius is discussed and upheld, the role of the work as panegyric rather than history discussed; even the authenticity of the chapter titles is handled (Cameron and Hall reject this).<br /><br />The only gripe I have is that the notes are at the back, rather than at the foot of each page.  I found I had to read it flipping to and fro.  And one simply doesn't *want* to miss the comments -- they are detailed, documented, and tremendously informative.<br /><br />This is in quite a different league to the ordinary English translation-only volume.  It is easily of the same standard as the Ancient Christian Writers series, and in fact probably better, as it has less philology and much more useful historical matter.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2003-01-01

ISBN 0-88402-088-6.  As well as being in the 'Corpus' series, it is also 'Dumbarton Oaks Texts 5'.<br /><br />The volume is the first critical edition of this anonymous 9th century work.  The Synodicon vetus contains a description of every church synod from the beginning to his own time.  Earlier material is usually abstracted or inferred from works like the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius.<br /><br />The introduction contains a solid discussion of the date of the work, with a detailed investigation of all the manuscripts and editions and a stemma.  The work was first printed by the Lutheran J. Pappus in 1601 from a poor copy made by the dubious copyist and trickster Andreas Darmarios, and sold to Pappus.  All subsequent editions have been reprints of this text.<br /><br />The text itself consists of the Greek with a facing English translation.  While I cannot evaluate the quality of this, it is certainly readable and seems close to the text.  The footnotes are limited, but useful.  A critical apparatus is provided, and the volume closes with an index.<br /><br />One curious feature of this work, is that a revised version (labelled SV2) exists.  The text of this is also included, but, curiously, not a translation.<br /><br />The work is of questionable historical value, since the author was an enthusiast rather than a scholar.  An example is that this work is the first known to mention the legend that at the First Council of Nicaea, the real gospels were separated from the apocrypha by piling them all on an altar and coming back the next day when, of course, the real ones had miraculously sorted themselves to the top (ch. 35, p.29).<br /><br />Dr. Duffy has done the world a favour by making this work available to us all.	2002-12-30

The series is generally very reliable, but it started to dive and reached bottom with that book.  The Jupiter Myth is inevitably an improvement -- but not much.  It's set in Londinium, but the plot is a retread of 'Time to Depart'.  Somehow it grates.  On the one hand, we expect Londinium to be pretty rural and basic.  But on the other hand we have this crime syndicate operating, invisibly?  This simply doesn't work.  Helena is nagging Falco, which doesn't really work either.<br /><br />So it's hard to recommend this one.

It is very easy to find studies of individual printers, or studies of particular locales, yet the broader picture is hard to see.  Also, to be useful, such a study must be well footnoted and referenced to allow for further reading.  This book by Brian Richardson is an absolute *gem* on all these counts.<br /><br />He takes as  his subject the beginnings of printing in Italy, but he wisely looks at how manuscripts were produced and used as well, and discusses the changeover.  This is not done sketchily, but in detail, and is well-referenced as usual.  Prices for books are discussed, and annual incomes too (so we can get some idea of value).  The analysis of the data is concise but very detailed, yet the detail never overwhelms the reader.  He discusses the manufacture of books, and the pagination and foliation systems, briefly yet incredibly clearly.<br /><br />The book is only some 200 pages.  It felt like 800 pages of good material, but it did not drag at all.  Richardson has truly mastered his massive array of material, and every sentence is clear and informative, and often deeply interesting.  For instance, that the price of the cheapest manuscript on paper would be around 3-4 ducats, when a man could live on 15 a year, and a middle-class family be normally on 40-50, is very useful to know.  Of course you could pay anything you liked for an MS, from that upward.  Vellum MSS were 4-5 times more expensive for the same text.  And the arrival of print caused the print to drop by 80% or more.  These details, always well footnoted to the primary sources - correspondence of printers, usually - are among the meat of Richardson's book, and mean that it will always have value.<br /><br />Problems?  Few are apparent.  This is a book to take slowly, and to annotate in the margins.  The index of people is not as complete as it should be - I remembered seeing a reference to Tristano Chalco, but his name is not in the index.  Other than that I could find no fault whatever with the book.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the manuscripts and printed editions of the 15th and 16th centuries *must* buy this book.	2002-08-10

After a brief overview of the knowledge of Greek in the middle ages (not much), he moves on to 1394 and the arrival of Manuel Chrysoloras in Florence, and the beginning of Greek studies in the Italian renaissance.  The translations by Leonardo Bruni are discussed - indeed the Latin translations in general give much information on the standard of knowledge of Greek.<br /><br />We meet, in turn, many notable figures of the renaissance, and the book is valuable for this, since it gathers information on many of these figures which is perhaps not all together in one place.  The same people, of course, were also involved in Latin and Patristic studies; Filefo, Traversari, Bessarion, Politian.  The end point is the death of Aldus in 1515, after which things in Italy are somewhat different.<br /><br />The notes are of a high quality as usual.  The book is indispensible to anyone interested in the transmission of the texts.  It ends with a discussion of which texts existed in 1453, but did not survive further; the only demonstrable example being the complete text of Diodorus Siculus, which Constantine Lascaris records having seen in the Imperial palace in Constantinople, and of which we now have somewhat less than half.<br /><br />The book is dense going, even though deft word portraits of many of the figures involved appear.  Very valuable stuff, and highly recommended.  Not easy reading, but must be a classic.	2002-07-24

The editors are clearly aware that any such discussion would render their book obsolete within a year or two as the issues are thrashed out.  There is an excellent section on the codicology.  It is difficult not to be impressed at the skill with which the jigsaw puzzle has been put together.  Interestingly some of the fragments bear Coptic page numbers - 99, 100, etc - which indicates the text comes from a larger volume.  The translation is literalist, which is very welcome, and the text and translation laid out opposite each other in the diplomatic manner.  The commentary attempts to elucidate the meaning of the fragments, and likewise avoids large and loose conclusions.<br /><br />Issues of dating are addressed very tentatively.  The book is parchment, in quires, written in a polished Sahidic Coptic, and displays some skill in codex making.  Analysis of letter forms suggests a date between the 4th-7th centuries - perhaps most likely somewhere in the middle.  The book has suffered damage by fire, but no comment is made about this.  The text seems to make use of both Matthew and John, with an occasional echo of Luke, and reflects the Coptic text of these works.  There is a reference to 'Aeons', the 'Pleroma', and other general Gnostic indicators, e.g.  'Do not let matter rule over you' (p.98 line 44 of the codex/p.31).  The editors feel that the 'latest date for its original composition is probably in the late second century' (p.2), although they fail to make quite clear why.  However a second century date for the work seems quite reasonable, in view of the definite but unfocused nature of the Gnosticism in the surviving fragments, which I suspect is the basis for their statement.  There is a general smattering of Greek words throughout the codex.  A very careful paragraph (pp.12-13) discusses evidence for one Coptic word being a too literal mistranslation of a Greek idiom and so 'implies that the Gospel of the Savior is based on an earlier Greek original subsequently translated into Coptic'.  The scholarly refusal here to say too more than the evidence demands, combined with the solid scholarship underlying it, makes very pleasant reading.<br /><br />There are full references to other ancient texts, probable or otherwise.  Curiously there are two references in the fragments which could relate to the long ending of Mark, (e.g. 'sitting at the right hand of the father upon your (sg.) throne', 17H 4-6, p71 = Mark 14:6, Mark 16:19 and  many other refs).  One of the statements of the 'saviour' is also found in the Coptic Gospel of Thomas - 'he that is near me is near to the fire; he that is far from me is far from life' (107.43-48, CGoT 82).  It is pleasing to see an awareness that some of the elements used may have no connection with any organised group but may simply be part of the general pagan religious climate of antiquity (p.24).  The pseudo-Christian title given to this document by the editors is unfortunate, in that it acts as a barrier to understanding, as M.R.James long ago pointed out in the preface to his edition of the 'New Testament Apocrypha'.  To call this work a gospel forces the editors to define a 'gospel' to mean nothing more specific than a work containing sayings or perhaps narrative about someone who may be called Jesus or is in some way based on the historical figure (p.1).  This ties the work too closely to somesort of pseudo-Christian context.  Few would doubt that in antiquity the extra-canonical works formed a broad spectrum, shading from orthodox works like the Acts of Paul right the way down to basically pagan texts which added some nominal 'Jesus' into the syncretist stew.  It would seem that the word 'gospel' has really outlived its usefulness if it prevents us from recognising and working with this continuum.  Doubtless the difficulty of finding another word has something to do with the continued popularity of the word 'gospel'.  To call the codex the 'Gospel of the Savior' also seems unwise, in view of the inferences that those ignorant of the subject will infallibly draw from it.  It would have been better to give it a neutral name like the Berlin Gospel.<br /><br />The work consists of dialogue between a central figure and his hearers, and an ascension by them all in 'to the [fourth] heaven'(p.113 line 16 of the codex - p.45 in the edition), scattering the discomfited 'watchers' and cherubim.  The central figure is referred to only as the 'saviour' and the words 'for us apostles' (113.3/p.45) and mention of Andrew and John suggest that the unknown 'author' is supposed to be an apostle, although I do not recall that this point is made anywhere.  The manner in which the saviour does his saving is unclear, due to the fragmentary nature of the text.  But he does do a lot of direct talking to the cross - 'A little longer, O Cross, and all the pleroma is perfected'(5F.30-32/p.55) etc, which may yet inspire some satire, perhaps about a previously unrecognised 'ecological Jesus', who talked a lot to trees!<br /><br />The focus of the book is the data, rather than the ludicrous theories that appeared in some of the press releases, and for that we owe them a debt of gratitude. Recommended.	2002-01-24

This book contains a useful introduction, and then parallel Latin and English texts of the Donation (in the abbreviated form known to  Valla) and then of Valla's refutation.  Originally published in 1922, the editor remarks that when he wrote, despite the fame of the Donation, there was no copy of Valla's works to be found in any US library.  The book is the foundation stone of all historical and textual criticism, and deserves first-hand knowledge.<br /><br />The introduction is clear and informative, with a minimum of opinion.  It is useful to learn that Valla composed the book as part of Alfonso of Aragon's campaign against the renaissance Papacy (the Reformation was about to begin at this date, and the abuses of the papacy a scandal throughout Christendom).<br /><br />The Latin text includes a critical apparatus - Coleman collated the only complete MS, as well as the standard editions.  The translation is clear and the footnotes useful without being intrusive.  Mercifully the book is free of polemic.  Philological notes are made, but these are not too heavy.<br /><br />The text is well worth reading to see to what extent Valla's methods are still valid today, which many of them are.  Of course the book is a declamation, not a modern study, and the violent language reflects the custom of the time.  Coleman indicates that he used it with his own students as a means to introduce them to the principles of historical criticism; the practise is sound, and should be more widely adopted.<br /><br />All in all a very useful edition of a classic text, which deserves to be better known.	2001-12-18
US	49773108	R21X3P2HVDBXR6	0879758899	227319347	Porphyry's Against the Christians	Books	2	82	110	N	N	Unusual text, but could do with better editing	While many of Porphyry's works were copied in Christian times, and Christians were generally interested in Neoplatonism, his work in 16 books rubbishing the Christians is lost. Works calculated to annoy both readers and copyists have few chances to survive. It was condemned as a mischievous libel by Constantine, without much effect, and again by Theodosius (448AD). The refutations by Apollonius, Methodius and Eusebius are sadly also lost. However fragments exist in various works by the church fathers, about half of which come from the Apocriticus of Macarius Magnes, preserved in a single 15th century MS (now lost). These are the fragments presented here.<br /><br />The book isn't aimed at the specialist - the issues of dating, the MS tradition (less info than in this review!), the many philological issues with the text are not addressed, and footnotes are only for the translation, and mostly simply summarise Macarius' response. However references to the Apocriticus are given (an improvement on the same author's Celsus).<br /><br />There is a rather pointless essay occupying the second half of the book, which the author admits is not for specialists and has not a single footnote. The introduction is unsatisfactory - for instance it does not even list the works of Porphyry. On the first page the quote from Tertullian from Ad Scapulam (title not given but obvious) is inaccurate; the lack of footnotes makes it hard to check others.<br /><br />The translation is very crisp, and much the best part of the book. It is not always very accurate. For instance he translates \\"The evangelists were fiction-writers - not observers or eye-witnesses to the life of Jesus\\" (p.32) where the Greek (and Crafer) says \\"The evangelists were inventors, not historians of the events concerning Jesus\\" (p.38, Crafer, p.20 of Blondel's text). Hoffmann's version suggests they were not eye-witnesses, and consequently he can make no sense of Macarius' reply. The correct translation allows us to see that 'Porphyry' has no opinion on this - a 20th century idea - but just says that their accounts are invented.<br /><br />I had wondered whether the book was worth doing. It is hard to imagine a series of reconstructions of lost anti-semitic literature being made. But somewhat to my surprise, it does have a contribution to make - a definite picture of the nature of Porphyry's work emerges, which makes it plain why it no longer exists.<br /><br />The arguments of Porphyry will appeal to Christian-haters - apparently the target audience (in the first couple of pages of the introduction almost every statement by a Christian writer is labelled a 'boast' or 'brag'). Porphyry's method is to highlight by pretending an 'idiot-boy' obtuseness to what used to be called quaintly 'bible difficulties'. A few pages of this will be enough for most readers, other than the anti-Christian believer.<br /><br />But the power of the work lay in its silent appeal to the embarassment at being different that any minority feels in a society that does not share its values. He sneers at Christian respect for the poor, for instance. Frequently he does not argue - merely assert that such an attitude is shameful. Of course once times changed, this process worked in reverse, and his appeals to the shibboleths of a vanished society were at best meaningless, and the obtuseness embarassing even to his admirers in Christian Greece. This then is the real reason the work had power, and why it is lost.<br /><br />This book suffers because the editing is not up to standard, and the statements made are usually undocumented and too often have not been verified. I missed any discussion of the many interesting problems of philology posed by the text. It would have been nice if Hoffmann had gone to look for the MS, as I suspect it is only lost because no-one has seriously searched.<br />It is always nice to see a new version of any ancient work, even if a popularisation like this, particularly for so obscure awork as the Apocriticus.<br />Note: This text has not been considered an academic work by the scholarly community; it is not listed in the academic bibliography l'Annee Philologique, and so I  presume was not reviewed by any academic journals.	2001-11-28

Daimbert and his friends (and enemies) are a cheerful lot, and their adventures are plotted without too much self-examination, which is very welcome. In this volume, Brittain reprises many of the locations from earlier books, as Daimbert travels around, finally wrapping up most of the loose ends from earlier series. Many characters make another appearance.<br /><br />In Yurt-5 the series was showing signs of becoming tired - plot-material from earlier books was reworked, and although the result was readable enough, I felt doubts. The same problem affects this volume, but much more so. The final volume in many series tends to be a let-down, as the author simply ties up the knots. I fear the same has happened here, although it's quite readable. Various threads *have* been left open, and we can perhaps expect more books sometime.<br /><br />Much as I would like to read more about Daimbert and Yurt, the author would be very well advised to give the series a rest.

Even in Origen's day, it was a scarce pamphlet - Origen had never seen or heard of it before he was asked to refute it. And since it explicitly insulted those who copied nearly all ancient literature, its chances were poor.<br /><br />The work was preserved because Origen of Alexandria wrote a point by point refutation. Extant only in a late MS and some rather better quotations, Contra Celsum forms the raw material for this book. It is disappointing that Hoffmann glosses over the MS tradition.<br /><br />The book consists of a preface telling a strange version of Christian origins much different to that given by anyone in antiquity. Unfortunately no evidence is given for this view, although incidental points of information are footnoted, which makes the preface of questionable value.<br /><br />The text itself seems to have been created by taking the portions of Origen's text, which were highlighted as probably by Celsus in Chadwick's magisterial English translation, and running them together. I looked at one passage, and compared the two versions. Hoffmann has added a fair amount of bridging wording, as a comparison with Chadwick makes clear. I would have liked to see Hoffmann's additions labelled as such, and the reference to Contra Celsum given. The translation seems to follow Chadwick closely, although Hoffmann says he made his own, and is probably the better for this. The order of the fragments is that of Contra Celsum. Some footnotes are also made, although the value of these is variable. Another passage I examined showed that Hoffmann had taken two sentences and two fragments, and rewritten them fairly freely, losing the original sense in the process. To what extent this is typical I cannot say.<br /><br />OUP's editors have ensured that the whole book is sharply edited and very well-presented.<br /><br />The comments that Celsus makes, from a range of mutually contradictory positions, are answered thoroughly by Origen. It is unfortunate that Hoffmann has ensured that these replies will not be available to the reader at the same time, as in some cases Celsus' remarks are liable to be misunderstood in a sense foreign to the period.<br /><br />Is this a useful volume? It is difficult to see that it adds anything to Chadwick, and to be fair Hoffmann in his preface seems to understand that some will feel this. The omission of Origen and addition (unmarked) of modern material makes the book essentially a speculative enterprise, based on no MS, but on the imagination of modern workers.<br /><br />The obvious public for this book is that constituency which is interested in anything that is anti-Christian, and doesn't care whether it's true or not, as can be seen from the other reviews. Material from the book is already appearing in contemporary atheist broadsides. While it is always good to have copies of any text which has survived, a book which is not a faithful copy of an ancient text, and which can only give rise to anti-Christian rhetoric, is something I would hesitate to recommend.<br /><br />Note 1: The book does appear in the academic bibliography l'Année Philologique, but was ignored by most journals.  It was reviewed only by two minor journals; a brief notice by JUNOD, Revue de Théologie et de Philosophie 122 (1990) 136; and TRIGG, Church History 57 (1988) 353-4. Both raise questions about the authenticity and integrity of Hoffmann's book.<br />Junod welcomes the translation but asks why the author doesn't discuss the philological issues in reconstituting such a text; how it advances scholarship; and why Hoffmann refers to works in the bibliography he plainly has not read.<br />Trigg notes that Hoffmann has actually revised Celsus' words to take account of Origen's replies and edited out superstitiouspagan content.  He concludes, \\"... not a bona fide translation. It would almost appear that Hoffmann deliberately wishes unsuspecting readers to see Celsus as a detached and skeptical professor of religious studies rather than as a pious Hellenist\\".<br /><br />Note 2: Hoffmann tells his reader that he made this book at 'Westminster College, Oxford'. Readers may not know that this is not part of the university, but a Methodist training establishment which in its final years published a number of anti-Christian books, and is now defunct.<br /><br />Note 3: The reader should not confuse Celsus Philosophus with the first-century medical writer Celsus.	2001-11-07

St. Irenaeus: Proof of the Apostolic Preaching (Ancient Christian Writers)	Books	5	45	45	N	N	Irenaeus, the Old Testament, and the Trinity	This work is not to be found in the online collection of the Ante-Nicene Fathers. Long thought lost, it is in fact extant only in a single 9th century Armenian manuscript, and was discovered there at the beginning of the 20th century. Once again the work of Irenaeus in Greek is lost; but fortunately the Armenian is a fairly literal version, evidently intended as a 'crib' in an era when fluency in Greek had already departed. The work was divided (by Harnack) into 100 chapters for ease of reference. Since Armenian is not a widely-known language of scholarship, the text has been difficult of access to scholars.    This edition is extremely valuable to those unable to read earlier work in German. It has copious notes on the text, a lengthy and useful introduction, and a very readable translation. As is usual with the series, the notes are oriented towards points of philology rather than theology.    Irenaeus puts forward the teaching of the apostles (he knew Polycarp, the disciple of John, personally) on matters disputed by the gnostics, heretics who attempted to corrupt Christianity with contemporary pop-paganism. In so doing he outlines the teaching on God, the Father, the Son and the Spirit, and without using the word gives a splendid outline of the doctrine of the Trinity. While deriding some of the gnostic ideas, Irenaeus concentrates on expounding the apostolic preaching, and on showing that the Old Testament in fact preaches the same deity in three persons as the New.    The book will be useful to everyone interested in the second-century Fathers. In view of the interest in gnosticism in our day, it will also be useful as a reminder to those who choose to forget that those with personal contact with the apostles and their appointees did not regard gnosticism as a legitimate form of Christian belief. Recommended.    Note: the only previous English version of this work is:  Robinson, J.A. (trans.) St. Irenaeus: The Demonstration of the Apostolic Teaching. London &New York: SPCK, 1920.	2001-08-14

If so, it is rather well done.  It is telling that he begins with a well-phrased demand that some attempt should be made to understand Tertullian rather than moving swiftly to abuse him.  He remarks that \\"Since the Enlightenment, no ancient Christian writer has attracted more hostility\\" and he acutely observes that much of the discussion in the past has failed to read the context of these remarks, and has therefore consisted \\"of the common game of 'telling men of straw that they have no brains.' \\"(p.xv).<br /><br />Osborn describes the different reactions in the literature to 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem' and 'Credo quia absurdum' in some depth.  He tries to give a fair statement of the positions adopted; that Tertullian is an anti-rationalist; a rationalist; a mediaevalist - and then offers his own insights.  There is constant interest in the Stoic influence on Tertullian, and in the connection with philosophy.  Chapters follow on Adversus Marcionem, Trinity and Christology and Montanism - where he makes the interesting suggestion that Tertullian's theological views did not in fact change at all throughout his extant work; only the way in which they were expressed.<br /><br />A barrier to the correct understanding of much of what Tertullian wrote he describes as 'Tertullian's trick', by which he means that 'missing' portions of the argument are often to be found elsewhere in Tertullian's output, and that Tertullian expects us to recognise it.  It is also pleasing to find recognition of the humour in Tertullian.  The book is not always as easy to read as it might be, perhaps because Dr. Osborn (rightly) tries to avoid imposing his own opinions on it.  On the other hand he is evidently appreciative of the splendour of Tertullian's prose, and produces some nice translations of selected phrases.<br /><br />These are just a few highlights from the book.  Certainly worth a look, if you can cope with the vocabulary.  The use of theological jargon such as the 'economy of God' without explanation may be a barrier to some readers.	2001-08-14

As such, it is a little odd to publish it now, decades later, in a world where even Catholic verities are not quite as simple as they were then.<br /><br />Daly's book is strange, on first reading. No-one would gather from the title that it is as much about Cyprian as about Tertullian. At every point the two are compared; and invariably to Tertullian's disadvantage. The emphasis of the book is on the degree to which these two authors reflect Roman Catholic teaching in Ireland at that date. Cyprian is good; Tertullian is bad. But neither, good or bad, lives in the book, and no picture of either man emerges.<br /><br />The title of Tertullian as a 'Puritan' is highly anachronistic; and in the mouth of an Irish Catholic of 1945 highly uncomplimentary. But it is the key to the book.<br /><br />For this book does not make much sense as a book about Tertullian, nor even about Cyprian. With a sudden sense of incredulity, the reader recognises that it is a book about Catholic and Protestant in Ireland. Cyprian is the figure of all that is right and worthy, the Republican Catholic; Tertullian the image of those vile Protestants in the north. Thus the title; thus the constant condemnation of Tertullian.<br /><br />With this a certain distaste sweeps over the reader. It is as well to remember the date at which it was written. The world was in flames. Hitler lay dead in his bunker, and an Irish PM sent his condolences to the Nazi ambassador. Eire was neutral, while the death-camps were liberated by the allies. And at that time, of all times, a young man sat down with venom in his heart to blacken his hereditary enemies. It is difficult not to be revolted.<br /><br />The book does have a certain value, as a source of references on Catholic practice, and indeed is probably more useful as a guide to the ideas of Cyprian.	2001-08-07

Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ? : Challenging the Existence of an Historical Jesus	Books	1	48	112	N	N	The myth makers	Doherty's book has made quite a splash on the internet. Earlier drafts of his work are available online. Now he has bundled it all up into a popularising book, which has certainly been found convincing by many people.<br /><br />His thesis is that there is no evidence that Christianity, the world's largest organisation, was in fact founded by a man known as Christ. This idea enjoyed considerable popularity among atheists a century ago, in the era before archaeology was possible in the bible lands. Doherty unashamedly refers to the ideas of this period, and clearly would like to revive the exploded Tubingen thesis of F.C.Baur.<br /><br />Most people will presume Doherty to be the master of his material, and he affects scholarship. However there are elements in his writing that raise questions about this.<br /><br />This can be seen most easily with reference to a portion of his book on which he has perhaps devoted least time. Rather than discuss the whole volume of his work, perhaps it would be most useful to zero in on the portion for which we have most evidence in the surviving literature, the second century. Doherty devotes a single chapter to this in the book.<br /><br />Most readers of his discussion on the second century will come away with the impression that a few writers support the standard view, most say nothing, and from this silence it follows that they did not care about the issue. But it is possible to review all the c.2 writers. This I have done, and found that, of the 10 writers, 6 (perhaps 8) explicitly assert the incarnation of God as man, and only 4 (perhaps 2) are silent. The silent writers are also those for whom the least works have survived. Those for whom we have some theological works both deny his thesis, and deny that it is unimportant. Doherty's failure to grasp this is difficult to explain. The lack of any useful footnotes in this chapter likewise is not encouraging.<br /><br />The dating of Minucius Felix to 150 is far too early, and ignores the massive literature, such as Axelson's Das Prioritatsproblem, on the vexed question of the interdependence of Tertullian and MF. Modern philologists unanimously date MF to around 230AD - some even to 258 (vide notices in the Chronica Tertullianea et Cyprianea). Once it is recognised that the author may well be a contemporary and colleague of Cyprian, what then becomes of the author's argument about a 'smoking gun'? The idea that MF was second century (160, not 150) is again dateable to 1910, and shows the antiquity of Doherty's information.<br /><br />In the chapter, Doherty also makes a point based on the presence of the Latin conjunction 'nam'. It's hard to see that this is worth making; or if it is, surely it needs to be made with reference to the philology on the use of parts of speech as it altered in the second century? But Doherty is not familiar with philology, it seems, and this tends to suggest an undergraduate knowledge of the subject, and not specially in Latin.<br /><br />On the basis of this sample chapter, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Doherty has not done his homework, or indeed been concerned to do it. Where his presentation can be checked, it is misleading. Where he intends to give an impression of scholarship, he in fact indicates that he lacks it. Any interested reader will be frustrated by the sporadic lack of proper references, although in this printed version he has added more to some of the chapters.<br /><br />The work is, in short, a polemic with references to data stuck on to it for decoration. But those who really want to know would be well advised to seek out the readily accessible primary data, devise ways to test the ideas, look for the logical fallacies, and, above all, obtain more up to date information on the present state of scholarship.<br /><br />Does the work have value? Not to scholars, certainly; but then it is hardly targeted at those with the facts at their fingers. Those who wish to obtain a historyof the period must go elsewhere.<br /><br />But it will be of interest to any who wish to see how strongly an argument based on absence of evidence can be made to those unequipped to perceive the fallacy. As such it will be a useful bibliographical reference for ideas that will certainly be widely canvassed, and a useful way to find the source of the many myths that will be derived from it. As such it is perhaps a useful purchase to anyone discussing these issues, so long as they ignore the persuasive style and look at the testable facts.	2001-08-07

Books	3	1	5	N	N	Orthodox, theological but a bit stodgy	The Tertullian portion of this work is rather old-fashioned and not very enthralling.  It does contain a review of the misunderstanding often encountered on Tertullian's Adversus Hermogenem that Tertullian did not believe in the coeternity of the Son.  However this is not enough to make it a necessary purchase.  Not bad - just a bit too old-fashioned.	2001-08-07

A brief introduction in French; and then the main body of the work.<br /><br />The book contains the Latin words used by Tertullian - even simple ones like 'et' and 'ac' - with references to the places in his works that they appear.  The typeface is that of a typewriter.<br /><br />Claesson has used the Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum (CSEL) text as the base of his edition.  For those who only possess the Corpus Christianorum volumes, he draws attention to the fact that the latter usually mark the CSEL page in their apparatus.<br /><br />The book is a vital tool for all philologists, and as such must be regarded as a huge advance in the study of the Latin of Tertullian, replacing the limited concordances of individual works.<br /><br />The only problem with this work is the text on which it is based.  The CSEL texts edited by Kroymann are notorious for the arbitrary treatment given to the transmitted text by this disciple of 19th century methods.  As such, few of his conjectures have been upheld.  However it is difficult to see what alternative was available; and a good, well-edited collected edition of Tertullian's works is still a desideratum.<br /><br />Only now with the availability of electronic CDROM's such as the Patrologia Latina and the Brepols CDROMS of the CCSL is this work being overtaken.<br /><br />The late Dr. Claesson deserves our thanks and our gratitude for this thankless task well performed.  A classic.	2001-08-07
US	49773108	R2QYWX6O3YWY5Z	0809101483	10794640	24. Tertullian: The Treatise against Hermogenes (Ancient Christian Writers)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A solid translation of a difficult text	The subject of the work is the origin of the world, and therefore creation. Hermogenes, a second century painter, cod-stoic, and heretic, following Stoic ideas, believed that matter was coeternal with God. Tertullian was by no means unwilling to make use of Stoic technical concepts himself, but drew the line at importing Stoic religious ideas in preference to the biblical teaching; and so was led to write this work. This volume is the translation made by J.H. Waszink, the eminent Dutch scholar. Waszink also published the Latin text from which this translation was made: Tertullianus: Adversus Hermogenem liber. Ed. by J.H. Waszink. (Stromata patristica et Mediaevalia). Utrecht, 1956. He went on to publish a text and German translation of Tertullian's work De Anima, also against Hermogenes, in which he established the definitive edition of that difficult work and make real progress in understanding the difficult terminology involved.<br /><br />Waszink was primarily a philologist of considerable reputation, and his text is oriented at solving the many problems which the inadequate state of the manuscripts pose for a work on so obscure a subject.<br /><br />The translation is the most recent in English of the work. At points it can be a little stilted, since the subject is difficult, English was not Waszink's first language, and in any event he wanted to give the literal meaning, not a paraphrase. However it is superior to the only other English version available, the 19th century Ante-Nicene Fathers version based on the now very dated and inferior Oehler text. The notes are philological rather than theological.<br /><br />The most up to date version of both text and translation is the new Sources Chretiennes Latin-French text. However Waszink's translation will be the standard where quotation in English is a desideratum.<br /><br />In summary, a good workmanlike translation of a little-known work.	2001-07-20

Minucius Felix: Octavius (Loeb Classical Library No. 250) (English and Latin Edition)	Books	4	37	37	N	N	A useful small edition	The Latin text of the Apologeticum is the rather elderly 1851 Oehler text; the text of De Spectaculis is that from the serviceable 1890 Vienna edition (CSEL 20).  The translation by T.R.Glover is very readable.  There are a small number of critical notes at the foot of the Latin, although not a critical apparatus by any means, and a useful preface.  Glover draws attention to the difficult problem of the dual Latin text and possible two editions of the Apologeticum.  A modern bibliography is on the fly-leaf.<br /><br />The Apologeticum is Tertullian's most important work, and this is a sterling translation of it.  While the edition is now somewhat aged (from the 20's, I would guess), it still is one of the best introductions to Tertullian.<br /><br />De Spectaculis is a rare work by Tertullian, preserved only in a single manuscript, and this edition makes it readily available.<br /><br />The volume is completed with a Latin text and pleasant English translation of the Octavius of Minucius Felix.  This last work deserves to be better known than it is.  Preserved by the slenderest of threads, the little book describes three friends walking along the beach at Ostia, and then holding a Ciceronian debate about the truth or falsehood of the Christians.<br /><br />Note that, as with all the older editions, a portion of the Latin of the Octavius which is obscene is left untranslated.	2001-02-19
