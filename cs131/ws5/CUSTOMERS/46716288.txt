A mysterious island, Leshp, rises up from the ocean depths leading to conflicting territorial claims and the onset of military opposition. Jingo is one of the most witty looks at the interaction of nationalism, racism & patriotism. <br /> <br />In the beginning: <br />\\"Why are our people going there?\\" said Mr. Boggis of the Thieves' Guild. <br />\\"Because they are showing a brisk pioneering spirit and seeking wealth and... additional wealth in a new land,\\" said Lord Vetinari. <br />\\"What's in it for the Klatchians?\\" said Lord Downey. <br />\\"Oh, they've gone out there because they are a bunch of unprincipled opportunists always ready to grab something for nothing.\\"...  The Patrician looked down again at his notes. \\"Oh, I do beg your pardon,\\" he said, \\"I seem to have read those last two sentences in the wrong order...\\" <br /> <br />The wily and unscrupulous Lord Vetinari, Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, seeing no way to avoid war, lets events take there course while Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, Duke of Ankh-Morpork & Lord Vetinari's more principled but frequent, if often reluctant, ally (and underling) extends the reach of law to the very shores of Klatch itself and Captain Carrot organizes a football game between the two sides! <br /> <br />Of course, in the lower ranks, patriotism is brewing: <br />\\"Lot of cowards, the Klatchians said Colon.  \\"The moment they taste a bit of cold steel they're legging it away over the sand\\"... \\"And of course they're all mad for fighting,\\" said Colon.  \\"Vicious buggers with all those curvy swords of theirs.\\" <br />\\"You mean, like... they viciously attack you while cowardly running away after tasting cold steel?\\" <br /> <br />Then an attempt on the life of the Klatchian ambassador brings the conflict to a boil.  Of course, just as in the real world, the causi belli are not what they seem. Surrender is victory and victory is pyrrhic.   <br /> <br />And of course, there is, as usual, the strange interaction between Vimes - the descendant of theman who killed the last King of Ankh-Morpork for the latter's brutality, Vetinari - the Patrician who is able to balance the dangerous mixture of groups and individuals who form Ankh-Morpork's elite, and Captain Carrot - apparently the descendant of the last King and who is well-liked enough to topple Vetinari but who prefers to be Vimes' loyal captain. <br /> <br />As always, the Discworld is a place worth visiting! <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-28

The book is an easy and enjoyable read, but probably intended more for the lay reader than for scholars of al-Andalus (indeed, the author states that the work \\"is intended as an introduction to the history and culture of Islamic Spain\\" which lays \\"no claim to deep or original scholarship\\" which explains why it only includes a list of recommended reading rather than a complete bibliography with chapter sources).  That being said, the book should deepen the understanding of the general reader. <br /> <br />Fletcher details the Islamic, Arab-led Berber invasion of Visgothic Spain (formerly a Roman territory) from northern Africa in 711 (after the conquest of northern Africa). We are informed that in large part the conquest was intended to further the Islamicization of the Berbers. Many of the cities were originally surrounded and reached an accomodation with the invaders allowing the continued existence of djimmis of Christians.  Those which did not were crushed and the lands of those who made any attempt to oppose the invasion were taken and redistributed (with the Arabs getting the most arable land and the Berbers getting the remnants). Captives were either ransomed or - if too poor or otherwise unable to pay ransom - sold into slavery. Conversion from Christianity meant an opportunity to advance oneself and to avoid periodic outbreaks of anti-Christian violence.  In the meanwhile, the conquest was pushed back from those northernmost areas considered least habitable, setting the stage for the slow \\"reconquest\\" of Spain.   <br /> <br />Following Arab-Berber conflict, a descendant of the expelled Umayyad dynasty took control of Cordoba and his descendants, including the blue-eyed, red- (except when dyed)haired Rahman III who also had the blood of enslaved Christian concubines and hostages.The rule of the Amir of Cordoba extended to cover al-Andalus and he took the title of Caliph.  During this time, periodic \\"crusades\\" and slave raids took place against inhospitable northern (and Christian) Spain while the Islamic conquest of Christian lands (as in Sicily) continued.  Despite this, the weak Christian states of the north slowly began extending southward.  Then in the 11th Century, civil war erupted in al-Andalus, resulting in the eventual establishment of various independent ethnic states (taifas). <br /> <br />These taifa states were slowly consolidated leaving 6 major states: Seville, Granada, Bajajoz, Toledo, Valencia & Zaragoza in which the arts and crafts blossomed.  On the other hand, instead of al-Andalus interfering in the affairs of client states in the Christian north, the Christian kings and counts began interfering in the affairs of the taifa states while the al-Andalusian influence in northern Africa waned.  Then a new wave of invasions occurred as the Almoravid fundamentalists came to buttress the Spanish Islamic states against the Christians.  Shortly thereafter, the Almohads entered Spain took control of the Islamic states but lost ground to the Christians as they continued to push southward from the 11th to the end of the 15th Centuries.  The last chapters deal with the existence and fall of the kingdom of Granada, last of the Islamic states in al-Andalus.  Here we see the interactions and tensions between the Spanish Nasrids and the Moroccan Marinids (and the latter's successors, the Fezzans). During this time, an uneasy peace existed between the Nasrids and the Christian Spaniards; however, the Turkish conquest of Constantinople resulted in a determination to complete the Spanish reconquest. <br /> <br />Fletcher touches on the existence of djimmis (or \\"protected\\" communities) of Christians and Jews in al-Andalus and of Muslims communities in Christian controlled areas.  In both cases, these communities managed to survive and flourish, to some extent, despite their second-class status.  These communities were very vulnerable and were often used as tools in Christian-Muslim relations.  Just as many Christians in al-Andalus either converted to Islam or immigrated north, so many Muslims in Christian Spain either converted or moved south; however, the Mozearabs (arabized Christians under Muslim control) and the Mudejars (westernized Muslims under Christian control)continued to exist and develop their own, unique cultures.  Both groups faced massacres, forced conversions and ethnic cleansing as the powers faced off and as more or less fundamental influence predominated (as with the Almohads and the Inquisition).  With the end of Granada, conversion or expulsion eventually became the rule although the Moriscos (often only publically Christian) were expelled in the 1600s due to their sympathies with Turkish Corsairs.  The conquest had ended. <br />	2005-05-21

It follows up on Bovill's GOLDEN TRADE OF THE MOORS and fills out Berber history in association with Richard Fletcher's MOORISH SPAIN. The author's stated objective is to examine the Banu Marin's contributions to the development of the Islamic Berber state. <br /> <br />This interesting, if sometimes dry, book is divided into 3 main parts, according to the author's Introduction: (1) the Berbers' search for their place in Islamic history, (2) the development of an Islamic State, and (3) the implementation of Islamic Institutions.   <br /> <br />The first part of the book studies the acculturation and resistance of the Berbers to the society of the conquering Arabs: original physical - and continued social - opposition toward the conquerors; the development of the myth that Berbers were originally of Arabic stock (in opposition to Arab ideas of superiority); and the praise of Berber culture and society during the taifa period of al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) after the fall of the caliphate and the rise of small, ethnic kingdoms & conflicts.   <br /> <br />The second part of the book deals with the rise of the Banu Marin (or Marinid dynasty of 1250 to 1465) of Zanata Berber stock after the fall of the Almohads.  It looks at Arabic and popular opposition to the legitimacy of the Marinids and of the backlash against the Jewish population associated with the Banu Marin regime and the attempt to gain control of appointments in religious and social institutions as the State continued to be reformed along Islamic lines.   <br /> <br />The 3rd part of the book looks at the evolution of tribal customs as they are integrated into the developing Islamic culture, as well as the development of numerous endowments for religious and other education - especially of the Medresas - and the conflict between the religious schools and the religious leadership.  The Conclusion touches on the \\"importance of history in the creation of national identity\\" and the problem of historical accuracy in this context. <br /> <br />This book is very much so a scholarly paper - probably developed from an earlier Master's thesis or Doctoral dissertation - complete with a mild style and copious end notes.   <br />	2005-05-21

Now one can compare the locations (and times) at which these different events occur! <br /> <br />While acknowledging that the African slave trade (both intra-African & Trans-Saharan) existed long before the Europeans arrived on the scene and accepting the historical accuracy of Berbers and Moriscos such as Ibn Battuta and Leo Africanus as well as of Westerners like Mungo Park and Dr. Livingstone, McEvedy attempts to maintain a neutral position throughout. <br /> <br />The work is not without flaw, for McEvedy could have left out pages 8 - 19 and actually improved the work.  More importantly, he fails to give any sources or references.  This limits the usefulness of the book's text and indicates that this is just an outline for use with more scholarly texts. <br /> <br />Still, the book provides a decent consideration of the early ethnic groups of Africa from the Afro-Asiatics (Hamito-Semitic), Niger-Congolese (\\"Negro\\") and Nilo-Saharans to the Pygmies & San.  It also gives a clear picture of the expansion of the Nilo-Saharans toward the west and of the Niger-Congolese (especially the Bantu peoples) to the south and east and the growth and expansion of Egypt, Carthage, the Roman Empire, the Vandals, Byzantine Empire and the Arab Caliphate. <br /> <br />We also get a clear picture of the break-up of the old Caliphate and the establishment of independent and virtually independent kingdsoms of Arabs (and Moors in Morocco & Spain)and their expansion (as well as that of Islam to the south with the development of the Trans-Saharan trade routes around 900 A.D.).  The rise of the Ottoman control of eastern North Africa, the beginnings of the relatively small Portuguese (and Afro-Portuguese) settlements at the Angolan and Mozambique coastsand the beginnings of Cape Colony.  The French slowly begin to establish colonies inAlgiers and Senegal, the expansion of the Boers and the beginnings of the \\"scramble\\" (see Packenham's THE SCRAMBLE FOR AFRICA) which resulted in almost all of Africa being made into colonies of the different European empires. <br /> <br />Of special interest are the maps showing the routes taken by the various Muslim and Western explorers and the growth of different parts of the population such that the Afro-Asiatics went from being the majority of peoples in Africa to the Niger-Congolese (along with the Nilo-Saharans) making up the vast majority of the African population.  McEvedy does an excellent job of explaining why, despite the very large number of slaves which were taken from sub-Saharan Africa, the local populations managed to actually increase in size (the number of people sold, captured or kidnapped into slavery was less than 1/2 the expected rate of increase and most were males thus only making minor reductions in the number of local women able to reproduce). <br /> <br />Again, an excellent introduction to African history and reference, but it should not be - and was not intended to be - a scholoarly work.  Indeed, the author even eschews the term \\"reference\\" in support of the idea that it is just an outline.	2004-08-29

It looks at the bases for diversity & unity in the region and the rise of Islam.  It then discusses the formation of the early Islamic state and the development of the Sharia (religious law)from the Koran and the hadith (or statements and actions ascribed to Mohammad), the development of the Shia in opposition to the corrupt secular governments and the rise of the different sects. It then moves on to a discussion of Western Imperialism and the resulting development of nationalism and individual states (as opposed to the Umma or body of the believers as a whole), including the growth of Zionism and the establishment of the Israeli state. <br /> <br />Then changes in the political landscape, especially the (failed) Oslo Accord, are discussed as are religious and politics - and the 3 types of political elites and of the various forms leadership has taken.  Moving on, it touches on the relations of the individual nations with the great powers (including the remnant of the now-defunct Soviet Union during its cold war competition with the United States) as well as looking at the foreign policies of the regional powers and at changes that have taken place globally (e.g., the fall of the old Soviet Union), the American-Iraq Persian Gulf War and the tensions with Kuwait and with regard to the Israeli-Palestine issue and Israel's relation to the larger Arab world. <br /> <br />Although this is only an introductory text, it makes a serious attempt at providing a holistic view of the Middle East and its often insoluble-appearing problems.	2004-08-28

Bovill, relying on<br /><br />written history (and some archaeology), traces the history of northern Africa from pre-Carthaginian times to the<br /><br />beginning of the 20th Century.  We are introduced to Carthaginian interests in black slaves and Roman trade (and warfare)<br /><br />with the Garamantes, Vandals, Byzantium's involvement in the region and the subsequent Arab conquest and spread of Islam,<br /><br />the rise of Ghana and Mali, the Sanhaja Berber's Islamic puritan dynasty (Almoravids) which spread its control across<br /><br />Northwest Africa and into Muslim Spain before being overthrown by the Almohads (another puritan sect),  the Almoravid<br /><br />invasion of Ghana, the rise of Timbuktu, the rise of the Songhai Empire, the (Moroccan) Al-Mansur's rise to power and<br /><br />wealth and the invasion of the Sudan (especially of the Songhai Empire), the increasing independence of the the Berber<br /><br />governors of the Sudan and the growing independence of the Arma (mulattoes), the rise of the Kanem and Bornu and of the<br /><br />Hausa states, the Fulani religious and slave wars and their ultimate demise as the Europeans began to extend their control<br /><br />over the region.<br /><br />Northern Africa, as Bovill tells us, is occupied by both light-skinned and dark-skinned people.  The former include the<br /><br />late-coming Arabs and the ancient residents - the Berbers.  The Berbers can be sub-divided into the Western tribes of the<br /><br />Botr (including the Zenata who formed the important Marinid dynasty of Morocco), the Branes (including the very powerful<br /><br />Sanhaja peoples), the numerous and widely spread Tuaregs of the central Sahara and a few other tribes.  Of these, the first<br /><br />two are westernmost and are generally called Moors (thereby distinguishing them from the more independent Tuaregs and the<br /><br />Moriscos who returned from Spain during and after the Spanish reconquest of al-Andalus).  The Tebu, Fezzanese and Haratins<br /><br />and Zhagawas make up the majority of the people of the Sahara who were dark-skinned.

The Black Company, the last of the 5 companies which started out from mythical Khatovar, is also the title of the 1st book in this series which ably melds gritty realism and high fantasy.<br />This book introduces us to Croaker, surgeon, soldier and annalist of the BLACK COMPANY.  Being used as bodyguards to defend the hated syndic against his own people and the vorfalaka (were-leopard) terrorizing the city, they are paid a visit by Soultaker the sorceress, legate of a powerful nearby empire. Faced with a no-win situation, the company takes service with the powerful legate in the combat with the rebel forces of the WHITE ROSE.  <br />Questions of moral philosophy abound.  The Lady, ruler of the Empire is ruthless and beautiful, yet with sudden impulses of sympathy.  Wife of an even darker and more horrible being, the Dominator, the Lady managed to escape while leaving her old husband imprisoned in a living death (of sorts).  Soultaker, their patron appears much more patient than many of her fellows among the TEN WHO WERE TAKEN (despite the possibility of becoming the Company's greatest enemy) and treats them much more as equals.  The rebel force of the WHITE ROSE, committed to fighting the &quot;evil&quot; Lady, are every bit as ruthless and bloodthirsty as their adversaries.  And the evil Lady, taken with Croaker's fantasies about her, becomes protective toward him and is willing to risk life and power to prevent the rise of the twisted Dominator.<br />Never has the boundary between good and evil been easier to cross or harder to define for the Black Company - or the reader.  A dark, yet realistically gritty tale heavily borrowing from eastern mythologies, this is well worth reading by anyone who is willing to accept that rather than everything being black or white, there is a lot of gray in the world.  <br />If you haven't already done so, buy it now!	2004-05-30
US	46716288	R1LR2OLM00MWWX	0140441239	138885707	The Conquest of New Spain (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	55	56	N	N	The soldier's tale	Bernal Diaz del Castillo, Governor of Santiago de Guatemala, wrote his account of the conquest of Mexico while an old man because he felt that many of the works concerning the conflict were little more than de facto hagiographies of Hernando Cortes.  Considering his feelings regarding the then-published writings of Bartolome de Las Casas, it is probable that he was equally concerned with rebutting the latter's colorful account of the conquest.  Diaz's account is straight-forward and without literary pretensions, presenting a pleasing contrast to the smoother narrative of Cortes' letters and the unbridled passion of Las Casas' BRIEF ACCOUNT.  In other words, it makes for quite pleasurable and interesting reading!  <br />One of the recurring themes is how the Spaniards are treated by non-Aztecans as they travel toward Mexico City.  Many of the states which were more distant from Montezuma's capital were quick to side with the Spaniards in the hopes of throwing off the Mexican yoke and ending their military threat.  When the Spaniards appeared to be successful and strong, their allies became more committed to them and when they were shown to be vulnerable their allies began to question the basis of loyalty to the new occupiers.  Once the Spaniards gained the upper hand, numerous subject peoples, finding that the Aztecan soldiers were no longer able to rape and plunder them or take their sons &amp; daughters to be sacrificed, began seeking the aid of the Spaniards and providing them with support.  Throughout, the  Tlascalans were their most powerful and consistent allies (and were quickest to adopt the faith of the apparently powerful Christian divinity).<br />Arriving at Cholula, a client-state of the Aztecs, the soldiers are nearly massacred and determine to make an example of the Cholulans in order to prevent similar occurrences by others who might be pressed to kill the Spaniards to please Montezuma.  Here we see an account which is fairly similar to that of Cortesas provided in his letters (which is not always the case) and which differs markedly from the 2nd- or 3rd-hand account by Las Casas in his BRIEF ACCOUNT.  After the leaders who attempted to get rid of the Spanish occupiers were killed (and Cortes was finally able to end the atrocities of his Tlascalan allies), Cortes forced a peace agreement on the Tlascalans and the Cholulans and the populace of the city soon returned.  Briefly mentioning Las Casas' BRIEF ACCOUNT, Diaz points out that the Franciscans personally visited the area and determined that Diaz's (and Cortes') account - and not Las Casas' - was consistent with the statements of the natives.<br />In Mexico City, the Spaniards were treated well as Montezuma and his advisors debated what to do with the newcomers.  They were allowed their own place to worship and were fed and clothed by the Mexicans.  Finding themselves trapped in the city with an inceasingly hostile population (which had found that the Spaniards were vulnerable) and indications that they were in danger, they took Montezuma into custody.  This combined with attempts to force the local populace to conform to less violent religious practices pushed much of the Mexican secular and religious leadership, as well as the populace, into a more hostile mode.  Violence escalated, a new leader was chosen by the Aztecs &amp; Montezuma was killed by darts and stones thrown at him and his Spanish captors.  The Spaniards manage to escape the city, then return with a large number of allies from the peoples formerly subjected by Montezuma and his recent ancestors.  After a violent conflict which severely damaged the once beautiful city of Mexico, the Spaniards win the day.  In the process, Cortes privately has the new Aztec leader, Guatomoc tortured to give up his treasury (which Cortes wants to keep largely for himself).<br />This informative and fairly dispassionate account of the conquest is gritty, realistic and deliberately shows the best and the worst ofthe Spaniards, the Aztecs and the subjected peoples who saw the coming of the Spaniards as a means of liberation from Aztec oppression.	2004-05-16

(Penguin Classics)	Books	4	41	47	N	N	Columbus Resurrected	J. M. Cohen's translation of various 1st-hand or near first-hand accounts, including that of Columbus' son, Hernando Colon's LIFE OF THE ADMIRAL brings the Columbus story to life.<br />The Introduction, coming from a translator of literature rather than a historian, is rather uninspiring; however, he does provide a rather thorough rebuttal of the argument, made by many supporters of Bartolome de Las Casas and referred to without explanation by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto in COLUMBUS, that Hernando Colon's work is a forgery.  Indeed, since it appeared long before Las Casas' HISTORY was published, the issue of forgery may go in the other direction!<br />The book, through early Spanish sources, looks at the rumor that Columbus relied on the map of an ailing Portuguese sailor.  It makes plain Columbus' error in thinking he was near Japan (Chipangu) and his belief that he would reach Cathay!  We see his rather innocent introduction to the potent tobacco plant and how the natives fed his belief that gold, pearl and spices were nearby.<br />Columbus is shown to be of mixed character: on the one hand, he generally seems to respect the natives he meets and makes an alliance with one chieftain against the 'cannibal' Caribs.  On the other, he takes several natives captive (to have them trained in Spanish so that they can serve as translators on future voyages), gives some Carib women to his men (who raped them as in the case of the vile Michele de Cuneo) and discusses conquest and enslavement of idolators [not particularly shocking considering the long history of conflicts and mutual enslavement between the muslim moors of Spain & Northern Africa and the Christians of Spain & Portugal].<br />Columbus' biggest problem appears to be his tendency to leave his men (39 on the first voyage) as colonies while he explores elsewhere.  Whenver he returns, the natives have either killed the colonists or were at war with them - often due to the Spaniards' greed and licentiousness. Indeed, atone point, he leaves his brother in charge and the Spaniards, being forbidden to sleep with the native women revolt and found a rebel colony where the women were supposed to be more accomodating!  Columbus ultimately is forced into an accomodation with these Spaniards and eventually conquers the natives.  We also see the separate voyage of Ovando to Hispaniola and the beginnings of the gold mines.  Columbus, not unlike a number of his successors,  suffered arrest and trial and, after his last voyage, was deprive of power and authority.<br />Columbus' voyages, following in the footsteps of the Henrican discoveries, would likely have eventually been made by someone but Columbus seems especially driven to exploration.  It was an unfortunate fact that he was also a very poor (and often absent) governor.  His actions, sometimes courageous and thoughtful, sometimes harsh and reflexive probably represent the more civilized men of his time - when the Middle Ages was just ending, slavery and religious wars continued in Spain, Portugal, North Africa and Italy, and people were still being burned at the stake for heresy.	2004-03-12

It's history is the history of the various peoples of the region and of French and American involvement in the area.<br />This is the story of the rise of the native civilizations of Malaysian and / or Indonesian origin and their displacement by newcomers from the north who vie with one another (and with Europeans) for control of the region. The early inhabitants of Cambodia were replaced by Khymer immigrants who established the state of Chenla and founded Angkor Thom in the 400s AD.  They, along with the Cham people of Champa (present-day Central Vietnam) became the major regional powers.  The Thais, a people formerly subjugated by the Khymer rose to power in the north and, in 1431, drove the Khymer from Angkor  Then, in the 1500s, the Portuguese reach the region and begin exploring.<br />In the late 1600s, Vietnamese colonists begin settling in the territory of the declining Champa state (around present-day Ho Chi Minh) and push into Cambodia.  Vietnam, along with the older powers of Siam and Burma vie for control of Laos and Cambodia while the Vietnamese people slowly consolidate control of the Mekong Delta in the 1700s and, with the help of the French, the entirety of this greatly expanded Vietnam is united under the Nguyen emperors.  Fifty-odd years later, Napoleon III invades the South, defeats the Vietnamese emperor forces and gains possession of the South (Cochinchina).<br />Over the next two decades, the French push further north and, by 1887, extended their control over the entirety of Vietnam.  France also extend its control over most of Cambodia and Laos.<br />Civil unrest develops as a small number of native Vietnamese control most of the arable land and bleed the peasants.

US	46716288	R3BHPT9GDT1LD7	0375702636	343046766	Trouble in Mind	Books	4	6	13	N	N	A troubling book	Litwack's TROUBLE IN MIND clears up any doubt about what was going on in the segregated South.  It wasn't just a matter of limited voting rights, separate schools and segregated neighborhoods.  Violence was rampant (including torture, decapitation, castration and burning alive of blacks rumored to have committed rape against white women - a charge which seems comparable to the accusations of witchcraft in Salem in colonial times) and peonage & tenant farming - in which the debts of the farmers were almost always greater than the value of their crops! - in many cases replaced rural slavery as a means of forced labor (including return of run-aways) much as serfdom replaced, to some extent, slavery in the high middle ages in much of Western Europe.  <br />The book aptly recounts how, post-Reconstruction, white supremacists, often through fraud (although, this would seem unnecessary where the majority population is white and accepting Litwack's assumption that most Southerners opposed black rights), were able to take control of the State governments and enact new Constitutional provisions which provided  limitations on the right to vote - including poll taxes and arbitrary information tests. Of great interest is the way in which, via bribery and the client-patron system, the Democratic party began pulling black votes away from the Republicans.  In addition, segregation and anti-miscegnation laws were passed starting in the 1880s.  <br />Litwack also argues that black responses to white oppression led to general hatred of whites by blacks - and to black nationalism.  Curiously, the use of black pride and solidarity was also used by the black upper class to encourage blacks to only shop at black-owned businesses - thereby helping the black upper class (curiously, the black middle-class' aversion to racial violence, we are led to believe, was often personal rather than based on racial solidarity - one biracial woman even being quoted as only caring because wealthy blacks were often the targets).  The book finishes off with the GREAT MIGRATION and the finding of racial prejudice in the North.<br />Although an excellent study, the book does suffer from some deficiencies.  Litwack would have been better off if he had read Ira Berlin's MANY THOUSANDS GONE and similar works regarding early racial intermixing rather than leave us with the implication that almost all biracial persons were the descendants of rapes of black women by white men.  Exaggeration of the difference between the status of poor whites and poor blacks is also evident - for example, my grandfather (who was white) was also a poor tenant farmer and my father (who made it to the 8th grade) went much farther than many of his siblings in education. In addition, there is a tendency to generalize about whites and cast them as either violent racists or patronizing liberal racists.  There also tends to be a pattern of stating a thesis, giving an example, restating the thesis, giving a second example, then restating the thesis again and giving a 3rd example as a way to direct the thought processes of the reader.  Notable, too, is the reliance on \\"popular stories.\\" <br />This being said, this book is still enlightening and should be required reading in high schools.	2003-12-13

Betrayed and court-martialed, he is about to embark on an unexpected and arduous task.  <br />Time is uncannily like an ocean.  The Chronotic Empire controls one part of the surface while the Hegemony occupies another (the future).  The surface of time is a wave-function with the crests, or nodes, separated by 170 years from those in front and behind.  Only at these nodes can someone travel from the past or future and remain without any continuous expenditure of chronotic energy.  The Chronotic Empire controls seven nodes and the non-nodal historical time that surrounds them.  The Empire continues to stretch its control over more and more nodes and the Hegemony, in fear that it's time frame will be overwhelmed by the temporally expanding Empire gets control of a device, a time distorter, which completely removes any object, person or place from existence anywhere in time - so that it or he/she never existed!<br />In the meanwhile, Hulmu, Lord of the Depths, is stirring far below the surface in the Gulf of Lost Souls. Hulmu a potential creature of the depths, along with his Minion and the heretical sect of Traumatics want Hulmu to become real and they can only do so by making sure that the fabric of real time becomes so distorted that creatures such as himself could come into existence.  To do that Mankind must be eliminated.<br />Aside from a great & original story, there are various metaphysical concepts running through the work.  Brilliant and Original - and reading it is, indeed, time well spent.	2003-11-09

Unfortunately, the section on classical Athens, by far the most important period in Greek history as far as it relates to the development of Western thought and philosophy is a fairly small section - although still quite enlightening and descriptive.<br />Part Three takes us from the Etruscan period (with its important influence on Rome) through the Republican period, the Punic Wars and the fall of Carthage, the Empire, the rise of Byzantium and the \\"fall\\" of Rome.<br />The Ancient civilizations of China, India, Kush and Axum had far less direct impact on the development of Western civilization than did Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia or Greece and Rome; therefore, they were not included in this work.  Similarly, Ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations were much further back in time (3000 years passed between the time of the rise of Sumerian cities or the unification of Egypt and the reign of the first Roman Emperor while only 2000 years have pass since the reign of Augustus).  Since Greece and Rome not only transferred ancient knowledge and culture but also added so much more to it, the book rightly focuses most on those two cultures.  <br />The whole is a lively and worthwhile introduction to the classical origins of modern Western culture.	2003-11-09

Osterhammel's book may well have been intended to provide \\"a theoretical and historical overview of colonialism with a minimum of value judgments\\" which, according to the JOURNAL OF WORLD HISTORY, is \\"[a] concise conceptual framework of the fundamental phenomenon of colonialism\\", but I am far from certain he succeeded.<br />There are, of course, a number of good things about this book:<BR>(1) it provides a clear definition (and distinction) of the terms colony, colonization and colonialism as those words are generally understood by that branch of academia most concerned with such concepts; (2) it provides a simple, easy-to-understand outline for each of these concepts; and (3) it is comprehensive (as regards colonialism and its related concepts).<br />Unfortunately, the system seems to suffer from some problems:<BR>(1) by attempting to create a simple, comprehensive system which takes into account the 3 basic concepts of \\"colony\\", colonization\\" [\\"a process of territorial acquisition\\"] and \\"colonialism\\" as generally used by political sociologists, Osterhammel is forced to link them together by stipulating that all three involve \\"the notion of expansion of a society beyond its original habitat.\\"  Unfortunately, of these only colonization is, strictly speaking, a process by the definitions he provides; yet he then gives us various FORMS OF (the processes of) EXPANSIONS.  The first two [\\"total migration\\" and \\"individual mass migration\\"] do not even involve \\"expansion\\", except as provided within certain specific limits, whereas the category of \\"Empire-building wars of conquest\\" is generally \\"colonial rule\\" without \\"colonization\\" [the only \\"process\\" with which he provides us].<BR>(2) Osterhammel's distinction between \\"border colonization\\" and \\"overseas settlement colonization\\" leaves no room for the possibility of subservient overland settlement colonization which is not merely a frontier extension of the border.<BR>(3) In his distinction between the 3 sub-types of settlement colonies / colonization he provides the \\"NEW ENGLAND\\" type as \\"displacement and even annihilation of the economically dispensable indigenious population\\" and, of course associates this with colonial New England.  Unfortunately, had the author read James Drake's KING PHILIP'S WAR, Jill Lepore's THE NAME OF WAR or Yasuhide Kawashima's IGNITING KING PHILIP'S WAR, Osterhammel might have been aware of the involvement of \\"Christian Indians\\", such as Sassamon, in the early colonies as well as of the use of Native Americans as servants and slaves.  Indeed, it was only after King Philip's War that the colonists became convinced that they had to move natives out of the areas surrounding the colonial towns.<BR>(4)The rather superfluous mention of \\"informal empires\\" (which in no way deals with colonialism - the title of the book, colonies or colonization).  Indeed, the only apparent reason for the inclusion of this term is to pay homage to the idea of the United States as an \\"empire.\\"<BR>(5) the work is highly Eurocentric.  Periodically, we see the word \\"white\\" used for colonial masters regardless of the use of specific examples.  Similarly, only rarely (and almost never in considering \\"modern\\" examples) do non-European actions come under examination.  Therefore such actions as the Vietnamese expansions into Champa- and Khymer-controlled territories [indeed, \\"foreign\\" - i.e., European - \\"encroachment on continental Southeast Asia\\", as our author tells us, began after about 1820], total migrations of sub-branches of the Dene peoples (in this case, the apaches and the apaches de Navajo), Mandan migrations eastward, the Dahomey conquest of Whydah (as well as other African conquests) never get mentioned.  Of course, by the careful (but often imprecise and subjective) usage of definitions (e.g., \\"a minority of foreign invaders\\", \\"in a distant metropolis\\" or \\"alien rulers\\" each of which put limitations on the possible characteristics of the \\"invaders\\"), the author may have decided he could safely ignore such non-European examples.<br />All in all, then, if one wants a clear and precise introduction to modern thought on colonialism, this is an ideal text; however, if one wants \\"a theoretical and historical overview of colonialism with a minimum of value judgments\\" then this book is not the best choice.	2003-10-05

Further, each such chapter focuses on the evolution of slavery in each region within each generation.<br />The book compares indenturement (and apprenticeships) with slavery and also describes how the influx of Africans from interior Africa swamped the Atlantic Creole populace, contributing to the idea of racial superiority (of whites) and the development of ideas about miscegnation as a polluter of racial purity.  The charter generation and later &quot;creolized&quot; generations were more likely to be able to win or purchase freedom whereas each influx of non-creolized Africans contributed to the &quot;Africanization&quot; of the black populace and to harsher restrictions on slaves and other black &amp; biracial persons. <br />The book looks at de facto property-ownership among slaves and the development of the slave economy and its importance in the greater economy. Berlin also looks at the early interactions between the races (going so far as to point out that most persons of mixed race early on came not from relations between white masters and black slaves(whether or not consensual) but between indentured or lower class whites and slaves or free blacks.  He also touches on the increasing competition between the white working class and blacks (enslaved and free) and the growth of vehement anti-black sentiments among working class whites.<br />Informative and stimulating, the book infrequently still tends to generalize such as with the implicit assumption of the general validity of the Woodson Thesis that free blacks generally tended to be more likely to own relatives - which was true (by law - see FREE BLACKS IN NORFOLK, VIRGINIA by Tommy L.

I was immediately impressed by the thorough coverage provided by Summerfield.  <br />The work starts with the basics: s-waves and p-waves and a brief introduction to seismology, a look at the apparent strata of the earth from the core to the atmosphere, and an introduction to endogenic (earth-originated) - e.g. mantle plumes and the &quot;conveyor belt&quot; effect leading to the movement of the lithosphere on the athenosphere - and exogenic (largely solar-related) processes - e.g., wind - which provide the energy for plate tectonics and the building up &amp; erosion of land forms.  Following this the work takes a more indepth look at topics such as various forms of uplift (orogenic and epierogenic processes such as block faulting, folding and igneous-related activity) followed by individual chapters on processes relating to coastlines, deserts, glacial, permafrost &amp; etc.<br />This is an excellent introduction to the earth sciences which treats the subject in a professional manner and largely eschews any indoctrination into or against ecological considerations.  <br />Highly recommended!	2003-08-23

Blackland), around Cape Verde and Goree, to Bathurst on St. Mary Island off Cape St. Mary near the mouth of the Gambia, then around the hump of Africa, past Elmina and Cape Coast Castle, and eventually reaches the island then known as Fernando Po (named after a Portuguese officer, Fernao do Po - now Bioko, a part of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea) near the more familiar islands of Principe and Sao Tome. Along the way, there are many vivid descriptions of people and locations.<br />At Tenerife, Burton provides a short account of the conquest of the guanches and describes them as being dark-complexioned [curiously, Peter Russell, in his excellent biography PRINCE HENRY 'THE NAVIGATOR' which recounts the beginnings of European involvement in West Africa, describes them as \\"probably fair-haired\\" based on descriptions in primary Portuguese sources].<br />At St. Mary's, Bathurst, he impugns Mungo Park, a well-known explorer, disparaging the latter with phrases such as \\"[s]o Park calls the Bomax,\\" referring to the term \\"bentang\\" - even though a \\"bentenki\\" tree plays a role in the Lion of Manding in Courlanger's A TREASURY OF AFRICAN FOLKTALES.  He also refers to Mumbo Jumbo (also mentioned by Francis Moore), which Park didn't come across until further from the coast, and coffles of slaves as \\"genius,\\" implying they are fictional - notably, he fails to mention that Park wrote before the British interdiction on slave trading. The entire attack is sadly reminiscent of Burton's actions and statements in relation to J. H. Speke in Alan Moorehead's THE WHITE NILE. Here, we are also introduced to his rather curious views on Africans - (1) the \\"noble\\" race which includes Berbers and Mandingos, (2) the \\"ignoble\\" race which includes \\"pure-blood\\" or typical Africans and (3) Kaffirs or others he thinks may also be biracial. Later, we are treated to something of the history of the establishment of El Mina and Cape Coast Castle as well as the cruel type of slavery practiced by the Efiks of Calabar - a comparison with slavery in the contemporaneous South of the United States being quite to the benefit of the latter!<br />All in all, the work is highly entertaining if frequently superior and derogatory to any and all with whom Mr. Burton disagrees or whom he dislikes; however, where neither Mr. Burton's desire for glory nor his prejudices come into play, the book appears to be generally accurate and informative.	2003-08-03

The book is broken into three parts: Park's travel narrative , Marsters' Introduction & Major Rennell's Geographical Illustrations Of Mr. Park's Journey (which is rather dry and dated).<br />The main work is a narrative of Park's travels from Barra, on the West African coast, to the town of Silla, just west of Jenne and his return to the western coast. Park provides many interesting details and asides, including that of Mumbo Jumbo (also mentioned by Francis Moore) for disciplining wayward wives.  Park also spends a fair amount of time explaining local governments and social norms. Throughout, the account attempts some degree of neutrality while noting acts of kindness and avarice by various individuals and rulers; although, not surprisingly, he explicitly criticizes the Moors who continually interfered with his progress and those who robbed and stripped him.  Perhaps his most disturbing account is of the female slave who becomes too sick to continue traveling with the coffle.  The entire work puts black slaves and their families in a very sympathetic light and shows the slave trade at its worst; although, due to the continuing conditions of slavery and internal conquest pre-dating major European involvement in the trade, Park stated that the termination of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade would not provide as great a benefit to the populace in Africa as many hoped.<br />The Introduction is important in providing the history of Park's early years, the important role of the African Association and its leader, Sir Joseph Banks.  More importantly the Introduction deals with the Bryan Edwards controversy. Richard Burton and Orlando Patterson's criticisms have held that internal African slavery and slave trading was not nearly so prevalent as suggested by Park.  In light of this, Marsters' statement that Joseph Banks, a critic of slavery, had to approve every piece of Edward's editing becomes extremely important.  In addition, it is made clear that the reason for the stylistic differences is that the original TRAVELS was a book derived from Park's notes whereas the published work of his second, ill-fated journey was merely a compilation of those notes retrieved from the dead man's party!  <br />All-in-all, an excellent and informative read!	2003-07-27

It is, however, much more than that.  The reader is treated to a rather informative economic and social history (especially as it relates to the slave trade) of France at the beginning of the 18th century, including the \\"reforms\\" of John Law.  It is also a brief history of the involvement of the European powers with the native peoples of the Gold Coast, a much more detailed history of Whydah and Dahomey (for the slightly gory origin of the name see Harold Courlander's A TREASURY OF AFRICAN FOLKLORE) and the effects of the slave traders on those States, a brief history of the status and struggles of free blacks under mulatto control in Principe and Sao Tome  (focusing on the life of the black Archdeacon Pinto during this period), a study of daily life for both crew and human cargo on a slave ship - especially during the arduous Middle Passage, and a brief look at the struggles and dangers facing slaves and, to a lesser degree, coca and coffee growers in Martinique.  The work finishes off by examining the questionable benefits of the various parties (including the financiers, suppliers and the officers of the ship) from the slaving voyage.  <br />This is an excellent work (aside from a couple editing errors which aren't worth mentioning but, going by reviews written elsewhere, may be greatly exaggerated by some future detractor of the work) and should be read by any serious student of slave trade.	2003-07-26

THE SLAVE TRADE: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade: 1440-1870 is, perhaps, the single most-important work dealing with the slave trade.  This masterful work builds on and partially overlaps John Thornton's AFRICA AND AFRICANS IN THE MAKING OF THE ATLANTIC WORLD, 1400-1800 and Edward William Bovill's THE GOLDEN TRADE OF THE MOORS.  It also provides an essential bridge between those works and Ira Berlin's MANY THOUSANDS GONE: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America & MAROON SOCIETIES: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas (edited by Richard Price).<br />Starting with the first major shipload of African (white, café au lait and black) slaves taken in a razzia by Portuguese in 1444, Thomas briefly looks backward at the history of slavery among Christians, non-African Muslims and Africans - pagan, Christian and Muslim.  He recounts the origins of the Atlantic slave trade - including the long-existing North African-Spanish conflict with mutual slave raids and the beginning of the coastal trade in West Africa associated with Prince Henry's desire for exploration, conquest, profit and religious zeal and the equal desire for conquest and / or profit of almost all African rulers and aristocrats, as well as of numerous merchants (especially Muslim and Mandingo), already familiar with the Trans-Saharan trade.  Thomas recounts the early settlements in the Azores and Madeira and Cape Verde Islands, as well as the lengthy effort to conquer the Canary Islanders, including the guanches of Tenerife, and the explorations of Cadamosto.  The trade began to be institutionalized by Agreements of mutual benefit between the west coast Africans and European traders (with increasing numbers of slaves being taken from the interior by coastal states)while the plantation system began to develop in Madeira and elsewhere. The fortress at El Mina (Sao Jorge da Mina) was established as well as Arguin and Luanda (which became one of the few exceptions to the principle of non-settlement - of Europeans in Africa - due to fears of antagonizing local rulers, losing trading rights and suffering debilitating and even deadly illnesses).   Luso-Africans (persons claiming both Portuguese and African antecedents) increasingly took over the coastal trade in El Mina and Luanda.  Despite the papal grant of Portuguese (extended to Spain when the two were temporarily united) monopoly over the trade, the English began entering the slave trade in 1562 under Captain John Hawkins and the Dutch began to be involved in the 1590s.<br />Thomas then describes the development of \\"corporations\\" given monopolies on trading slaves by the various European monarchs and the economic benefits accruing to various European towns, as well as the growing wealth, culture and influence of various West African towns involved the trade.  In the 1600s, African slave began to trickle into North America followed by the eventual establishment of the slave-plantation system.  Turning to the crossing, Thomas describes, in vivid detail, the horrible conditions slaves encountered aboard ship as well as the high rate of deaths for both (often shanghaied) sailors and human cargo and the inhumane treatment provided to both by the officers as well as the harshness suffered by the latter under the African captors.  Included in this section (Book 4) is an account of the various non-human cargo brought to and from Africa.<br />Turning to the Abolition (of the Slave Trade, if not slavery, itself) movement, the author touches on the views, organizations and actions of political men like Pitt, Wilberforce, Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Lafayette as well as the anti-slavery philosophy of men like Montesquieu, Hume, Adam Smith and Burke (in opposition to the interests of men like Voltaire and Locke).  In 1807, the reluctant slave owners, Madison and Jefferson, in America, enacted legislation banning Americans from involvement in the international trade of slaves while non-slaveholders William Pitt and William Wilberforce did the same in the British Empire.  Great Britain began to pressure other nations to end the slave trade and many African states began to use more of their slave captives to produce goods for international trade in lieu of slave. Portugal, at the same time, began to trade in even greater numbers of slaves.  African merchants also actively opposed the attempts by Britain's AFRICAN INSTITUTION to increase the industriousness and productivity of the general African populace due to the potential danger to their trading interests.  Britain paid various African leaders to end the trade (although many captives were executed since the rulers could not sell them due to the abolitionist sentiments among Europeans and Americans).  Still, slavery itself was not actually abolished in the British West Indies until 1838.  In the mid-1850s Brazil and Britain neared war and Britain forced Brazil to adopt anti-slave trade measures in earnest.  The book concludes with the end of Cuban involvement in the trade as Britain began to forcibly occupy some African states (setting the stage for the eventual \\"colonization\\" of the continent) in order to finally squash the trade - although the epilogue informs us that as late as 1980, 90,000 blacks are still reported as slaves to Arab masters.<br />It would not, of course, be fair to leave off without pointing some negligible errors in the book: First, the Sources and Notes section seems to have provided bold headings for some of the latter sections (books) but not the former.  However, this does no discernable harm toward the body of the work and a few seconds study will clear up the confusion.  In addition, while apparently relying on the best statistics available for the total number of slaves transported via the Atlantic / Trans-Atlantic journeys, the work fails to directly rebut some of the much larger numbers proposed by some historians.  The author (in citing one minor source) also fails to respond to the criticisms of Sir Richard Burton and those almost identical ones of Orlando Patterson (who fails, however, to indicate his reliance on that noted bigot) on Mungo Park's reliability.  However, such a response is readily available in Kate Ferguson Marsters' Introduction to Park's TRAVELS IN THE INTERIOR DISTRICTS OF AFRICA.  Thomas also fails to explain why he differs with Bovill on the exact relationship of the Sanhaja and the Tuareg.  All-in-all; however, these are minor points and hardly detract from the incredible depth, breadth, organization and vividness of this masterful work!	2003-07-26

Although I read this many years ago, I still consider it one of the most unusual and interesting sci-fi books I have read (although, perhaps, not equal to Jack Chalker's JUNGLE OF STARS or Kuttner and Moore's EARTH'S LAST CITADEL).<br />The HELIX AND THE SWORD [apparently The Trickster's Sailing<BR>in hardcover] is a fascinating look at the distant future where nuclear war (between the Second English Ascendency or America and the Empire of the Rose (Soviet Russia) has driven Man from Earth where limited resources caused man to adapt by creating living spaceships and worlds called synes (synthetic lifeforms) which can only be created by the mysterious Sisterhood of the Nucleotides.  Life is strictly regulated and most people can only reproduce by a Writ of Generation given for outstanding service.  Jesus, Karl Marx and Arthur the Blessed Clarke compose the trinity while Yuri Gagarin, the first Cosmonaut in space, is considered the trickster who escaped gravity!  <br />Treachery and intrigue follow the hapless Dyson as he is caught up in an assassination and secret plans to return man to life on Earth.  <br />Unfortunately, this book suffers from two flaws: (1) it is somewhat dated due to the fall of the USSR, and (2) near the beginning, the author makes the mistake of having Dyson trained in the arts of the fist and having, as required, killed a man, barehanded, yet later on it becomes clear that Dyson is no trained killer and that such is quite foreign to the character.<br />Otherwise, this is a very entertaining book.	2003-06-08

The backdrop to the story is this: Jhelerak, formerly a white magician who challenged Hohorga the Maleficient and was defeated, has lapsed back into evil after Dilvish's ancestor, Selar, killed the Maleficient One.<br />Much later Dilvish prevents Jhelerak from sacrificing a young woman and Jhelerak turns Dilvish's body to stone, sending his soul to the deepest Hell the dark mage can manage. Centuries later, Dilvish sells his soul to the supernatural creature Black in return for escape and getting vengence on Jhelerak - an aim which has become Dilvish's obsession.  Just as Jhelerak was completely changed by the actions of the Maleficient, Dilvish riding a black mount \\"from hell\\" and equipped with the blackest of magics, the Awful Sayings and the eyes of a demon, returns for vengence.  Although a work of \\"high adventure\\" the book is filled with philosophical considerations combined with bits of humor [\\"The Devil with them all, Dilvish the Damned\\" says one anti-Hero referring to the possibility that gods and devils might simply be alter-egos of one another!  And \\"'Damned if you do and damned if you don't,' said Dilvish the Damned, dismounting\\" referring to Dilvish's tendency to risk his life for damsels in distress].<br />Somewhat similar to (but better than) Jirel of Joiry or Elric of Melnibone, this is well worth the read.	2003-06-08

In addition, it looks at how African culture influenced and encouraged the slave trade.<br />Starting with a consideration of African concepts of property (i.e., only personalty and chattel could be considered property by individuals since all realty was under collective ownership and could only temporarily be alienated), Thornton builds on how chattel property, notably slaves, were the basis for individual wealth in West Africa prior to the arrival of Europeans.  Next, he considers how this caused the numerous wars and raids that continued to take place throughout West Africa.<br />He also looks at whether (and to what extent) supposed European superiority encouraged the slave trade - or at least made it a more violent and dehumanizing practice.  Europeans governments were kept out of Africa and had to largely rely on factors or intermediaries for trade - with the exception of the Luso-Africans in Angola.  Europeans traders had to submit tariffs and bribes to the local rulers and nobility, as well as meet the rulers' quotas at inflated prices.<br />As to economic pressure for trade, Thornton notes that there were no essential goods which the West sold to these leaders that could not have been otherwise attained in Africa.  In addition, iron and horses could be bought from the Arabs and were also produced and bred in West Africa.  The sale of Arms, especially, the early matchlocks (harquebuses), but including the later flintlocks provided little or no trade benefits because not only were they not decisive in African conflicts but various European nations were willing to sell weapons if one nation attempted to use the non-sale of weapons as a leverage to force a local government to unwillingly trade in slaves.  <br />Turning to slaves exported to the West, he points out that not only did the fact that many of them were formerly military prisoners mean that they were excellent soldiers for various militias, but that they were also potential leaders of maroon colonies quite capable of being a real military threat to local slave-owners.  In addition, many skills acquired from local African activities, such as rice and indigo production, led to their usefulness and importance in work on plantations - and, therefore, to the eventual development of artisan workers and the slave economies of various American (and African island) economies.<br />Again, an excellent primer for the study of African involvement in the slave trade and the development of the Americas.	2002-08-24

This is an excellent introduction to the evolution of black-white relations in mainland North America and to the development of racist attitudes based on cultural diversity.<br />Africans began arriving early in English-American history. Some of the first of these arrived in Virginia. A number of black Atlantic creoles, notably the Johnsons and Drigguses arrived in Virginia, managed to survive the tidewater massacre and other problems relating to survival and even to gain enough personal wealth to buy their freedom (or were subject to voluntary manumission due to appreciation for their outstanding service to their owners). These black former-slaves (and, possibly, some black indentured servants) set up plantations on Virginia's east shore (where the coast doubles backs around Chesapeake Bay) and established plantations. They owned slaves and purchased white indentured servants. In addition, because the racist aspects of slavery were still largely limited by the cosmopolitanism of the Atlantic creoles, several of the families intermarried with whites. <br />Slowly, over a period of time, an increasing number of non-creole blacks arrived as slaves and the distinct markings, customs and languages of the numerous new arrivals resulted in hardening racial sentiments. Some blacks, such as Anthony Johnson's grandson (also Anthony Johnson) began to consider Africa in a positive light as opposed to European racism and restrictions on the rights of free blacks - eventually leaving for less restrictive colonies, such as Maryland. Some were re-enslaved (not having been able to produce clear evidence that they were free and not having any living whites who could attest that their ancestors had been freed). As Ira Berlin (MANY THOUSANDS GONE) points out, some remained as relatively wealthy planters, such as Ezicarum Driggus even after such racist sentiment crystallized.<br />This should be read with Tommy L.

They were often taken in razzias from Muslim states such as Zanzibar (see Ibn Battuta in Black Africa).  Many of these Zanj were taken to the  Mesopotamian region of Iraq and put to work on giant agricultural \\"plantations\\" and in mines.<br />The Zanj were involved in a number of insurrections, all of which were failures - until they joined the uprising formed by Ali b. Muhammad, a non-Zanj, non-black Muslim.  Although the Zanj made up a large part of the revolutionary forces, few Zanj (unlike the black leaders of Maroon colonies in Jamaica, Brazil, Mexico, Cuba and etc.) had any real power in the new revolutionary state.  Still, their continuing adherence to the state (which, as Popovic tells us, included black soldiers who defected from the Caliph's and local leaders' forces) tells us that they preferred society under the non-black Ali's dictatorship to slavery in the fields and mines.  On the other hand, as with many western maroon colonies, the Zanj and others had no problem taking goods and slaves from (and making slaves of<BR>the local population).<br />The nascent civilization continued to grow for many years, until the Caliph decided he had the time and resources to make a concerted effort to destroy Ali b. Muhammad's young kingdom.  Using a combination of force and amnesty, the official government quickly began driving Ali's forces back into the swampy areas south of Basra and eventually drove the remnants of the rebellion to the rebel capitol.  Within a few years, the \\"Zanj\\" Revolt was over and Ali bin Muhammad was dead.<br />This historical, social and anthropological study of the Zanj Revolt stands with Price's MAROON SOCIETIES as an important study of the development of government, customs, and social status in societies generally - as well as a study of a rather interesting aspect of the black diaspora caused by slavery.	2002-08-24

Jacobus Elisa Johannes Capitein was an African who was taken as a slave from his native Africa as a child.  He was provided with a high level education, freed and sent back to Africa as a missionary.  He wrote two noted treatises, of which this is by far the more important.  Curiously, when he requested (from his missionary superiors) that he be allowed to marry a local woman, they instead sent a white European female to be his wife.  Although initially highly thought of by his superiors, there is evidence indicative of increasing friction on both sides as to \\"ways and means\\" of converting native Africans to Christianity.<br />The Treatise.  Capitein, in an argument which essentially pits him against Las Casas' much more voluminous treatise, holds that it is perfectly acceptable for Europeans to hold Africans and African-descended people as their slaves.  He cites biblical and canonical sources for this argument.  Doubtlessly, various persons would consider this to mean that he was a \\"traitor\\" to blacks suffering enslavement!<br />We should, however, note that Capitein excluded cruel treatment of slaves as not being acceptable by the Christian fathers and biblical testament. Further, he lived in a time where arguing that slavery was unacceptable would have led to him being considered an extremist and resulting in his opinion being dismissed out of hand; whereas arguing for moderate treatment of slaves based on religion would be more likely to be accepted.  In addition, such a position meant that the masters of black slaves would be less likely to oppose the conversion and, subsequently, education of their slaves!  Such Europeanization, as Ira Berlin has noted in MANY THOUSANDS GONE, generally leads to greater independence and opportunities for slaves - and somewhat less harsh treatment than occurred when slaves were \\"reAfricanized.\\"  As a whole, then, it seems that Capitein (or Asar, which may have been his original name or may have been derived from Afer, referringto an African), was far from \\"betraying\\" Africans and persons of African descent and was pursuing policies tending toward the amelioration of the conditions under which they labored.	2002-08-11

Ben Janvier (or Benjamin January, in English) is a free black returned from Paris after the tragic death of the love of his life.  On his return, he becomes sadly reacquainted with the second-class status of free blacks in Louisiana. Heroes and villains and everyone in between cross the color spectrum; although, the chief villains tend to be white.  His mother was a placee who provided him with an education and raised him but is often viscious.  Then there are his two sisters, one a voodoo priestess and the other, the delightfully charming, innocent and (probably) ultimately tragic Dominique, a young, beautiful and  innocent placee of color. Outside his family is the tobacco-chewing \\"Kaintuck\\" Shaw, a white man who, despite the characterizations of the Americans as tending more toward racial bigotry than the French or Spanish whites, clearly dislikes the system of slavery and deeply sympathizes with January.  There is also the poverty-stricken white Hannibal, January's friend and co-musician who is highly educated but suffers from consumption.  Weaving her way through the books is also the extremely delightful Marie Lavosier, the Voodoo Queen of New Orleans who is a devotee of both Jesus Christ and Papa Legba.<br />Although Ms. Hambly does not always appear to be historically accurate in every detail, the whole appears to be a delightfully (or, perhaps, sadly) authentic recreation of life in that time and place.  All four in the series are a must read for anyone who likes period fiction, antebellum history or simply a good mystery story!	2002-08-11

He considered the effects of slavery on both blacks and whites and found it to have pernicious effects on both. Although written prior to the Civil War, the book (actually a series of extensive selections from the three original volumes based on his newspaper articles written during his travels)provides a rather indepth and refreshing look at well-known history and looks at the diverse roles played by blacks, white southerners, (and northerners!) in slavery. He also examines their views on the slave issue itself: some nascent Southern abolitionists and colonialists, as well as advocates of slavery, appeared rather intelligent and some otherwise. Many considered slavery an insoluble problem and others defended it as a necessary evil which benefitted blacks and whites alike(!). After completing his tour (including a rather interesting situation in which a black slave seriously injures a biracial runaway, has him clapped in irons and sent to jail - much to the amusement of some white southerners - & an enlightening discussion, especially in light of Talty's research showing persons of pure white descent, including adult foreigners and children who were originally indentured were kidnapped or illegally sold into slavery, of how demeanor would be an adequate determinant of whether or not a \\"white\\" slave was really free or not), he provides a critical analysis of slavery and its effects on the south.	2002-06-24

Washington, Frederick Douglass & etc) I read concerning antebellum black and bi-racial history. It was so interesting I have since read a dozen others. As the authors state in the Introduction, this book really focuses on biracial persons of white/black ancestry. However, because, presently, persons who tend to be dark complected often consider themselves (and are considered by others) to be black and because the laws of antebellum South Carolina clearly differentiated between whites and free persons who did not fall into the white category (including pure blacks and biracial persons), the authors used the term BLACK MASTERS in the title. <br />The book is generally about William \\"April\\" Ellison, born a slave but well treated, trained in mechanical skills and then freed as a young man. Because of this, the authors believe him to be the biracial son of the white planter Robert or William Ellison. Once freed, April officially had his name changed to William Ellison and moved to Statsburg, a wealthy suburb away from his previous owner. He slowly amassed a fair amount of wealth; although, unlike many of the more aristocratic planters of South Carolina, William \\"April\\" Ellison worked his own fields and, in his role as a mechanic, had to walk a fine line between independence and not overstepping the bounds permitted to a free person of color. His was the only family not considered white by his fellow South Carolinans who was able to sit in the church on the ground floor in the pews reserved for well-off whites and wealthy planters.<br />William Ellison's family interacted with and married into some of the better off free families of color in Charleston. He became a member of the BROWN FELLOWSHIP and FRIENDLY MORALIST SOCIETIES which was generally limited to biracial persons (in fact, one biracial person was expelled from one of the societies because he maintained close ties to free persons who appear to have beenof pure African-American heritage, leading the society to decide he was socially a black rather than a biracial person). FPCs who were apparently of pure African ancestry also had their own societies (and owned slaves) as, of course, did persons considered to be of pure European ancestry.<br />Much of the book focuses on the curious position of biracial persons in South Carolina: many wealthy whites wanted to re-enslave free blacks (which, in their minds, included anyone of African extraction) while many poor whites wanted to prevent anyone of African ancestry (free or enslaved) from being able to hold any skilled positions (thus effectively opening many areas employment to themselves). In the wake of the slave rebellion led by the well-off free black named Denmark Vessy, these views gained much support and many laws on education and etc were temporarily enforced with enthusiasm, only to be narrowly defeated. <br />The Ellisons supported the Democratic Party and the Confederacy, even though William's sons were not allowed to enlist in the military. William's grandson, who (according to the authors)had noticable \\"black\\" features also attempted to enlist and was accepted even though the officers knew his family and ancestry - apparently the question as to whether or not he was black never came up! During the Civil War, Wisdom Hall and the other dwellings on the Ellison estate barely avoided being destroyed, but the Ellisons began to lose their wealth and as their old white friends died or moved away, the family began to be considered, even by their neighbors, as simply another black family.	2002-06-24

A slave (the daughter of two black persons brought to the United States as slaves) woman, Marie Thereze Coincoin develops a long-term relationship with the wealthy Claude Thomas Pierre Metoyer. She eventually becomes free and gains property (including slaves).  Once Metoyer and Marie Thereze go their separate ways (or at least end their intimate, if not their business assocation), Marie Thereze continues to add to her property.  Her oldest son, the mulatto, (Nicolas) Augustin Metoyer buys property on Brevel Isle and is soon followed by his siblings, their children, and various other free people of color, forming a colony, which includes some of the wealthies people in the very wealthy surrounding community, including, of course, Augustin Metoyer.  Many live in very fine mansions, such as Melrose.  The colonists live as well off as the wealthiest whites even when economic stagnation sets in.  They side with the Confederacy and, after the war, the community begins to crumble.<br />The book also offers us a tantalizing look at the placeage system, which also has its less official counter-parts in places such as Charleston.	2001-05-12
