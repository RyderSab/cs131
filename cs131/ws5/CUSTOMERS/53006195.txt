Compared to the natural drama of those earlier photos, the present group seem contrived and merely melodramatic. And instead of the super-real textures--textures that you wanted to reach out and touch--he has tried some new printing or over-painting techniques that are not very effective--almost every photo and/or model is solarized or daubed or spatter-painted or metallicized or whatever. And the poses and subjects are repetitive and uninspired. I guess that an artist can't follow the same path for his entire career, but this seems more like a backward step than an advance.	2004-06-15

He insists on seeing--and proclaiming through his work--exactly those visual elements of the bullfight that everyone else sees but adamantly ignores. One of his major themes, perhaps the major one, is clearly announced on the dust jacket by the image of a semi-tumescent lad wearing only his taleguilla and grasping a pair of bull's horns (which may be why Amazon shows no cover illustration above). Afanador's style might be described as a cross between the baron von Gloeden and Helmut Newton, or maybe Diane Arbus with more than a dash of Robert Mapplethorpe. Like Mapplethorpe he finds morbidly erotic beauty in places where some would not care to venture, but beauty it is. And like all the above-mentioned photographers, he is an absolute master of his craft. Whatever you might think of the subject matter, the photos are technical marvels--one wants constantly to reach out and touch all those rich textures! The prospective buyer should also be aware that the range of subject matter goes beyond toreros in--and out of--their tight pants, and I would be doing Afanador an injustice to leave the impression that his work is merely pornographic. (One of the most striking images in the collection is a shot of four matadors' jackets hanging from meat hooks in the abattoir). And beyond all the possible influences I've mentioned, his is a style--rather, an inseparable combination of style and subject--that's very much his own. <BR> <BR>I suppose that the few poems sprinkled throughout the volume are appropriate accompaniments to the photos, though they could easily have been dispensed with. The introduction is quite helpful, as is the thumbnail index at the end which identifies models and locations. The volume itself is richly produced and beautifully printed, with a sewn-in ribbon bookmark. ...<br />Even Hemingway, through Lady Brett, couldn't help remarking on \\"those tightgreen trousers,\\" but for too long the majority of people (especially artists) associated with bullfighting have pretended to ignore all those lurid paquetes y nalgas. Afanador's stunning collection goes a long way toward remedying that ignor-ance. Overall, a long-needed addition to the body of art and photography associated with toreo.	2001-12-19

Yes, one more review of this monster, only because I have some different views on a few of its features.  But first, to reinforce what others have written, it's a tremendously satisfying read.  I read it twenty years ago and am now almost finished for the second time.  I picked it up again because I was so tired of flailing around looking for something worthwhile to read--with all the jillions of books out there, the number of truly rewarding ones is remarkably small.<br />But it's amazing how different the experience is the second time around.  The first time, I was so completely enchanted by the style alone, and gave my concentration to it so completely, that I missed a lot of the &quot;story&quot; (if it could be said to have one). Now I'm beginning to think that that is part of Proust's enormous joke on the reader.<br />Here is a narrator who succeeds wonderfully in rendering every character in his story--every character, that is, except himself. Even his girlfriends--given what we now know about Proust's having modelled them after men he was obsessed with--come across as quite believable females, even if they are a bit hazy around the edges compared with, say, the vibrant and robust portrait of Robert de Saint-Loup that fairly leaps from the page. And in Mme Verdurin and Baron de Charlus he creates two of the great characters--the great people--of all literature. But he fails to create a believable person in his narrator! For despite the narrator's claims that his company is ardently and constantly sought by everyone from soldiers in their barracks to dukes and duchesses in their drawing rooms, he never--NEVER, in the course of thousands of pages--gives us one instance of his wit or charm when interacting with others. In fact, he impresses one as a rather repulsive little creep, neurotic and neurasthenic in the extreme, and rather cruel.  This is not to say that he fails to be witty and charming as a narrator--far from it.  First of all, there are the marvelouscharacters mentioned above. And if the reader can somehow weather the tedious, meticulous, seemingly endless analyses of his &quot;love&quot; for Gilberte and, even more remorselessly, for Albertine, one encounters passages of great lyric beauty, sentences that are entrancingly serpentine, metaphors stunningly original  and transitions masterfully seamless.	2001-12-08

Furthermore, this majority seems to be about equally divided between those who worship the big-game-hunting macho man and those who detest the phony braggart who could leave no good deed unpunished (Is it possible he might have been something of both?).  Well, this book is for the former group--all those world-class jerks, for instance,  who misread &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; as a guide to behavior and who return to Pamplona year after year to impose their obnoxious drunkeness on the infinitely patient and kind Navarrans (who truly know how to enjoy themselves).  Sure, read this tawdry fawning memoir, but for the right reason: because it shows just how obsequious the most worshipful of Hem's worshipers could be.

If you are a painter, there is very much to be learned from these paintings.  The phrase &quot;paint lovingly applied&quot; in the editorial review is most apt--and as a result, one loves looking at it.  This man is really a PAINTER, an artist who revives one's faith in painting here at the turn of a century that has seen more than its share of charlatans and feeble talents.  Everything he paints looks profoundly delicious, and the landscapes and cityscapes from the 80's and 90's are like thrilling dreams.  The book is a revelation!	2000-11-24

All my life I've enjoyed looking at pictures of naked men, but almost always with a tinge (at least) of guilt or shame.  This book goes a very long way toward freeing me (at last!) of some of that shame.  The first volume was fine, but the second is, for me, light years beyond it. These are the &quot;porno&quot; stars, the models, the MEN, that I grew up with, the men that I had crushes on, admired, &quot;loved&quot; in a distant way.  And of course one always wonders what has happened to one's past loves.  How thrilling and fulfilling in some strange and wonderful way to see, first, that many of them ARE still alive, and, second, to see how they look.  And they look, to a man, strong and handsome and well.  For every Casey Donovan who sank into a slough of drugs and sleaze (exactly what our internalized parents told us would happen to all such &quot;perverts&quot; and anyone who liked such pictures), there are a dozen or more who have not only survived, but have made interesting--and often startling--careers for themselves.  And now I feel that I truly do love these men for having lived their lives, for having done what they've done.  There's a lot of hogwash being circulated these days about liberation, but this book is truly liberating.  I thank these men.  I thank the makers of this book. <br />By the way, I think it's marvelous that Charlton Heston is included.  I'm not surprised that he posed for the photo, only that he allowed it to be reprinted after having so carefully created a (phony) image for himself over so many years. Also, children read the book Ben-Hur, not Gore Vidal's movie script for it.	2000-10-30

Or is it the other way  around--imposing notions of the work onto the life?  It hardly matters--the  result is the same.  Nothing of substance is said about either, and in the  process of saying nothing, she drags in all kinds of ugliness.  Of course  all the while, the author is claiming to be a great admirer of Johns, even  as she purveys her gossip and hearsay.  Finally, as is usually the case  with such psychographers, she's just revealing her own unsavory motives and  hungering ego.

Lynn starts with fancy theories about  Hemingway's supposedly twisted psyche, and then goes looking for proof in  Hemingway's works.  And with no apparent awareness of contradiction, Lynn  interprets Hemingway's works based on a theory of Hemingway's inner turmoil  while condemning others for basing their interpretations on hero-worship.   Lynn and other Hem-haters seem unable to bear the disturbing reality of  Hemingway's genius, the purity and invulnerability of his best prose.  But  now this &quot;biographer&quot; has managed in a thoroughly suave way to  mix up Hemingway's supposed life with his previously unsullied works. In  fact, at some points it's impossible to tell whether the pronoun  &quot;he&quot; in one of Lynn's sentences refers to Hemingway or to a  character in one of his books. Does no one else feel discomfort rather than  titillation at being forced to peep into the rather shabby fantasy life of  an audacious psychograper?  This is the kind of production that has made a  complete shambles of scholarship in the late 20th Century.  I just hope  that in the next 100 years people will stop trying to read Hemingway and  will start to read his books.	1999-07-13

It's scary to think too much about what kind of person would give this &quot;not a novel&quot; five stars--but never mind; I'll  stick to the rules and discuss the book. For one thing, Botton can't write;  grammatical, structural and usage errors pepper the pages.  I'm sorry that  I have room to point out so few.  On p. 5 he mentions a writer who  &quot;blithely declared his intention to devote himself to a final game of  bridge, tennis and golf.&quot; Imagine that--all three rolled into one  game; now that would be diverting indeed.  B. does no better with  parallelism on p. 9 where he notes that Proust's novel is a  &quot;universally applicable story about how to stop wasting time and start  to appreciate life.&quot; Mere quibbles, you may protest, but what about a  &quot;writer&quot; who can't even make subject and verb agree? (p. 25:  &quot;. . . there are a stream of extraordinary benefits attached.&quot;)  And I defy anyone to understand the opening paragraph of Chapter 4:  &quot;A good way of evaluating the wisdom of someone's ideas might be to  undertake a careful examination of the state of their own mind and health.  After all, if their pronouncements were truly worthy of our attention, we  should expect that the first person to reap their benefits would be their  creator.  Might this justify an interest not simply in a writer's work but  also in their life?&quot;<br />Even if you make allowances for B's inability  to use pronouns that agree with their antecedents, can you tell what the  antecedents are supposed to be?  And even if you get that far, the  &quot;this&quot; in the last sentence has so many possible antecedents that  any attempt at comprehension becomes impossible.  Dangling phrases,  misplaced modifiers, hopelessly-tangled syntax--B is master of them all.  But enough.  The careful reader, the astute reader, the kind of reader that  it takes to read Proust will, if she or he cares to bother, find such  howlers on every page of this not-a-book.  As for the content, B seems to  think that he invented the (sophomoric) notion that the characters in  literature are to be &quot;identified with.&quot; He even goes so far as to  include a photo of his girlfriend to show how much she looks like Proust's  Albertine.  Has the man no shame?<br />You're either going to read Proust or  you're not, but in either case Botton's whatever-it-is will add nothing to  your understanding or appreciation.  And while Proust may indeed change  your life, you certainly don't need this puerile and pretentious collection  of scraps to help you realize it.  The thing starts to live up to its title  only when its compiler quotes, summarizes or &quot;explains&quot; Proust's  novel, but why should you listen to Botton's simplistic and  anti-grammatical ramblings when you can have the enchanting experience of  reading Proust's work itself?ad Proust will, if she or he cares to bother, find such  howlers on every page of this not-a-book.

US	53006195	R3TB9LEIVY1FZL	0679418229	8621447	Miracle in Seville	Books	1	7	13	N	N	outrageously inaccurate and badly written	Anyone who knows Spain and bullfighting can only cringe (or hoot in derision) upon reading this ridiculous book.  One has to wonder if Michener ever really visited this country.  Among the many inaccuracies in the book,  I'll list a few of the craziest: he has Spaniards spending pesos (the  currency in Spain is pesetas), he has the locals referring to El Puerto de  Santa Maria as &quot;Santa Maria&quot; (which no one does), and he has two  bullfighters blaming a third for ruining their chances of getting carried  out of the bullring in triumph (this simply never happens--each bullfighter  is judged on his own merits).       And the book is just badly  written--somehow managing to be dull and melodrmatic at the same time.  The  &quot;fiery gypsy&quot; is an absurd stereotype, and all the characters are  presented in the most wooden and amateurish manner.      Only John Fulton's  fine illustrations save the book from being a total loss (but Fulton--who  was himself a matador--should have been ashamed of himself for being party  to such a travesty).	1999-03-09
