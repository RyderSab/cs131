US	50513854	R1PBKWPSJKS5MP	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	4	2	3	N	N	I understand why everyone is talking about this book	This is a wonderful book that gives many of us some insight into some aspects of life in Afghanistan before and during the Taliban. It is about two young men of different classes that grow up together but find that the friendship is torn asunder by the rape of the Hazarah youth (Hassan) and the guilt of the Shiite (Amir) who does nothing about it. After years in America the upper class Amir finally is able to atone for his guilt by adopting Sohraib the son of Hassan who has been killed by the Taliban. <br /> <br />You ought to read the book and fill in all of the details that are not provided in this description. What makes this a great book is the compelling prose that kept me riveted for hours at a time. That same prose described relationships mainly amongst men; it described a culture that most of us know little about save for the mediated impressions from our television sets; it describes a secular morality that is as strong and as abided by as fundamental faith.  <br /> <br />In reference to a comment about God's will, Amir says \\"There is only what you do and what you don't do\\" Since the main characters are agnostic they have to use their own moral guidelines to do the right things and to suffer when they fail. It is not unlike Sartre's understanding that our actions are the only reality and that those actions are driven by our morality. Catastrophes such as war do not change that. Hosseini presents this throughout the book.  <br /> <br />When Hassan learns to read it conjures up imagery from the movie The Black Robe or William Styron's description of Nat Turner's ability to teach himself to read. This is moving and beautiful. <br /> <br />One problem that I did have with the book was that I was able to predict too many events in advance. Without giving away the story I recognized in advance that Amir would be adopting Sohraib and that Assef was the executioner in shades but I incorrectly predicted when Sohraib would speak again. <br /> <br />Amir struggled with an immense guilt, a serious moral lapse for over 20 years but was assured by his mentor that \\"A man who has no goodness doesn't suffer.\\" In the end Amir could feel resolved by the actions he took. They are the only reality in the end.	2005-09-30

It is a very thoroughly documented history of some of the greatest thinkers in every era. She also sites many lesser known sages and provides us plenty of examples to support her argument. She uses a very personal sometimes humorous style that makes this tome compelling throughout the whole book. For those in need of a poignant quote Hecht provides them routinely in every chapter. <br /> <br />From the beginning, philosophers have been compelled to face their own beliefs and societal mores by proposing \\"Doubt\\". Doubt need to be understood for what it is and what it is not. There are many variants to the concept of doubt and they include amongst them-skepticism, agnosticism, atheism and humanism to name only a few. Skepticism is not \\"throwing the baby out with the bath water\\" but it is a discipline that does not accept things on the surface. It is the questioning of ideas on their own merit. Doubt should not be confused with atheism nor should it be considered as rational in every case. Understanding historical religions provides a mirror of today. At every level in this historical book, the issues are incredibly similar to those facing us. <br /> <br />The use of religion as a social control has been shown by Hecht from long, long ago. The reaction of those who cannot accept faith on its own merits marched right along with the constrictions of so many religions. Hecht describes this condition across cultures and time. It appears as if it is part of the human psyche though she does not suggest that tacitly or overtly. <br /> <br />Gods are considered in several ways. In some cases they are all powerful creators who control all events on earth. In others they are \\"hands off\\" creators who leave our machinations to ourselves. These two main types of gods have been understood throughout history and today are referred to as theism and deism. Balbus described four main reasons for belief. That god has foreknowledge of events; god has created the blessings of nature; the witness to awesome natural spectacles and the regularity of heavenly bodies. Balbus wrote thousands of years ago that \\"Only the arrogant fool would imagine that there was nothing in the whole world greater than himself. Therefore there must be something greater than man. And that something must be God.\\" Michael Behe and his \\"Irreducible Complexity\\" owe Balbus for that quote. <br /> <br />Once cities formed and humans socialized, religions formed to speak to the beliefs of the people. They were formed more out of the need to create order from chaos rather the issue of good versus evil. (While an argument may be made that these two concepts are one in the same I would posit that they may really be a \\"nature versus deity\\" issue). As in current times, fundamentalist religious leaders and their flock require fundamental answers to questions. Answers have to be firm and unbending. They had to be relied on and passed from one generation to the next. They were designed for obedience and custom. St. Augustine lamented about the agony of hesitation that result from not owning the correct answer to moral dilemmas, <br /> <br />Thinkers on the other hand were not satisfied with the descriptions. Religion was described as a method to keep brutish people in line or for political ends as just two examples. Many doubters wrote about the grand scale of bloodshed that has historically been the cargo of religion. The central question of skeptics-if there is a god and he is good why are there catastrophes. <br /> <br />Today fundamentalists use a notion attributed to Martin Luther that essentially says that a lie for god is not a sin. It is easy to identify many of the lies spewed by religious leaders and it is not dissimilar to the tactics such as magic and sorcery used to make sacred points in the past. <br /> <br />\\"There are those who have argued that all our beliefs aboutthe gods have been fabricated by wise men for reasons of state, so that men whom reason could not persuade to be good citizens might be persuaded by religion. Have not these also totally destroyed the foundations of belief?\\" Cicero <br /> <br />Hecht examines religion and doubts both historically and culturally. The book is not limited to western societies by any means. She cites Zen Maxim \\"Great doubt; great awakening. Little doubt: little awakening. No doubt: no awakening.\\" The idea of a just God in a cruel world is the central point of doubt. She also sites a few ironical biblical notions of the doubt of Jesus. He asks God (who he is one third of) to relieve him of the burden of Calvary and in his dying (?) moments he cries out \\"Why you hast thou forsaken me?\\" This is confusing to the skeptic because it addles the understanding of  <br />Jesus' immortality and his place within the trinity. It is not confusing to the true believer who uses faith as an explanation for all things not understood. Of course there are also believers who use questions and uncertainty to better understand their own faith. <br /> <br />\\"Even within the closed system of Christianity, doubt was understood as the only way to know anything.\\"  Kierkegaard for example, saw the pitfalls of religions in the quest for a greater personal faith. Other belief systems used transcendentalism, koans and riddles. Eastern and western religions use doubt for faith building-negating, god in order to prove god and to push on in the search for something better or more meaningful. <br /> <br />With the age of enlightenment and reason along with technological and scientific breakthrough came a greater acceptance of agnosticism and atheism. While not all great thinkers professed a specific non belief, many described how the world could work without divine intervention. From Kant to Hume from Bacon to Darwin, serious if not specific questioning of a deity was rampant. Of course even with greater acceptance therehas always been a reaction from those inspired by faith.  <br /> <br />The greater examples include the Inquisition or the trials of Galileo but there also were many subtle one such as the term atheism becoming a euphemism for amoral and the constant reminder of the \\"Godlessness\\" of the communists. In our own country the backlash caused the changing of our dollar bills and National Anthem to include religious phrasing. It created the McCarthy witch hunts and the extreme fundamentalism that has swept this nation. The same fundamentalism drives people to vote for candidates and causes that are not in their own best interests.  Religious leaders have always felt and preached that unchecked reason leads to disbelief and the most startling and cogent point of  this book is its historical imperative and looking at what is being publicly discussed today. <br /> <br />Despite this, skeptics, atheists and humanists have prevailed and they have spoken out. As Bertrand Russell indicated \\"What the world needs is not dogma, but an attitude of scientific inquiry, combined with a belief that the torture of millions is not desirable, whether inflicted by Stalin or by a Deity imagined in the likeness of a believer.\\" Werner Heisenberg used his scientific theory of uncertainty to point out the philosophical understanding that despite all of our knowledge and technology, we are objectively prevented from being certain  <br /> <br />Later Sartre wrote about the need for atheistic morality. He viewed human actions as the only reality and those actions are dictated by morality as if it is a legacy. \\"In a godless universe there is a desperate need for each of us to be moral and to act for the betterment of life.\\"  <br /> <br />The anti Post modernist, Salmon Rushdie speaks to the cultural relativism of the west and how it seeks to avoid its old crime of cultural imperialism, now perpetrates a new injustice by denying universal enlightenment standards for human rights. Like Sartre, he indicates that atheism forces us to live better; it forces to live better because we are responsible for what we do and what we fail to do. <br /> <br />Hecht was almost gleeful in describing women rationalists and doubters and with good reason. Hypatia's sense that all evil is man made and that nature cannot be evil and Anne Royall citing with disgust that how the poor were exploited by the churches and missionaries just as they are today are but two examples. Others include Fanny Wright and her empiricism \\"observe, compare, reason, reflect understand'; and...we can do all this without quarreling.\\" The great feminist and emancipation advocate Ernestine Rose and the English scientific humanist, Margaret Knight are also described as were many other great women thinkers. <br /> <br />It is difficult to give full justice to this book in a three page critique. It is a serious book highly researched and presented in a very readable way. I sensed some real joy by Jennifer Hecht as she wrote these words. \\"Doubt gets a lot done\\" claims the author. <br />	2005-09-30

We have heard the pundits provide many explanations but more importantly have listened to our politicians make the same mistakes and attempt to fight the same battles over again. Lakoff gives a methodology for hope, for the future. <br /> <br />He uses the concept of \\"Framing\\" and how memes are used by the Republican party to get votes. His premise is that the Republicans come from a \\"Strong Father\\" perspective and the rest of us from the \\"Nurturant Parent\\" perspective. These guide our morality and values. The Republicans currently have a strong hold on the American public; they elicit votes that are often against the voters self interest and they do this by successfully Framing issues. The opposition finds themselves attempting to battle these issues using the Republican frames. They fail because they are not using their own Frames. <br /> <br />Lakoff provides many examples of how issues can be reframed from the perspective of the nurturant parent. It will be hard work and take a long time but it is an important effort. Those of us who disagree with the current administration are patriots too. We need to \\"...ask what we can do for our country\\" and Lakoff provides a worthy starting point. <br /> <br />Though his message is important I wish that this book was not so sloppily composed. It is a stitching together of speeches, lectures and papers. That has made it filled with redundancies and often has a certain shrillness to the message. Nevertheless his point is well taken. <br /> <br />	2005-09-04

They would rather have the void of purpose...than to be void of purpose.\\" E. O Wilson <br /> <br />There is a concept of \\"convergence\\" that is used by many evolutionary scholars to make their case that evolution is real, factual and not only tells us about history but allows us to make valid predictions about the future. This notion of convergence tells us that there is not one specific event or proof that guarantees that the theory of evolution is real but there exists detailed evidence in many arenas of science that all point to the same conclusion. <br /> <br />Origins Reconsidered provides a methodology of convergence that is critical in making a case for what appears obvious to the thinking individual. Unfortunately, the theory of Evolution requires constant re-proving. Evidence which has been overwhelming for the last 150 years is still subject to \\"debate\\" for a contingent large in numbers, who have attempted to erode the credibility of this science by locating little chinks in the over all armor. Briefly, convergence is the making of inductions from classes of facts that may be disparate in and of them selves, and making strong scientific cases for each class. Once that is done the convergence of all of these explanations makes an extraordinary case for the over all objective. In this case the objective is that the theory of evolution is once again, strong and obvious. <br /> <br />The book is written in six different parts that take the reader through an explanation of methodology, through some obvious conclusions and lastly into some speculation about what the future bodes. The authors tell most of the story in clear and sequential ways. Initially part one \\"In search of the Turkana Boy\\" is more prosaic and nearly fictional in style. It describes the setting and friendships amongst skilled and intellectual colleagues in search of \\"Missing link\\" or at least additional verification of paleo-anthropological evolution. In this section I did worry that I was reading the wrong book; that I was about to endure a book of anecdotes about what life in the anthropological dig would be. Fortunately I did not give up. <br /> <br />Leakey attempts to make a case for how the first humans came about. At what point are those of us who are considered human distinguished from other nearly similar hominoids? Leakey explores aspects of personality that of course include the use of tools but extends the search to the beginning of language, writing, musical instrument making and art to name a few aspects. <br /> <br />He explores the concept of consciousness and morality to further his premise. While many animals have instinctual altruism and show human signs of affection it is the ability to remember things distant and to create an ethical code of morality that distinguishes us from Cro-Magnons and other late near humans. <br /> <br />Leakey furthers his case by addressing evolution itself and the arguments against it. He talks about the arguments and dismisses them succinctly. \\"In many cases the urge to know surpasses what can be known; questions without answers.\\"  Many find this impossible to accept and seek mysticism in its place, extracting meaning where none exists. <br /> <br />Leakey would applaud the fact that mankind has evolved into the most powerful animal on earth but he has no delusions that this is part of a divine plan. There is no predestination in evolution. Mutations occur that are of benefit and help those survive to pass that gene on and improve the species. What has happened in history is only one possible result. There is no inherent superiority in adaptation. Humans have always tried to have a gap between them and animals mainly because of the need to assuage our subjective consciousness. <br /> <br />Origins Reconsidered also discusses how difficult paleontology really is. He uses the problem of distinguishing early hunter/gatherers from scavengers as an example. Both leave their orts in locations that are very difficult to distinguish. At the same time these are very different survivors. <br /> <br />Ultimately Leakey maintains that while currently humans rule the earth it may not always be so, at least not as we understand humans. He sees the future as one wrought with ecological problems. He uses the notion of mass extinction to make his point. He asserts that throughout history there have been many periods of natural mass extinction. Those were precipitated by events such as Ice Ages. He maintains that Biota are fairly resistant to natural disaster. Floods for instances can apparently wipe out some local vegetation but that same biota can revive. Man made ecological disaster is another matter. Leakey's concern is that the current trends toward smog, deforestation and global warming my create a pathos that vegetation cannot withstand. <br />   <br />Leakey and Lewin display very clearly, the science behind their own efforts but they also describe the weaknesses of science in making determinations about what is a human. Those weaknesses are noble when they are ascribed based on sound scientific theory and otherwise when \\"proven\\" by only considering results that make one's point. <br /> <br />Leakey may have an axe to grind. He presents excellent scientific evidence but was never trained as a scientist in any field. Of course he is a scion of one of the most prolific of paleontologists; he never received a degree of any sort to lend to his credentials. His skills come from \\"on the job training\\" but they are sound. I believe it is rare that an individual can produce sound evidence to back up their empirical claims without the scholarly background, Leakey has done it. <br /> <br />As a non scientist, it is my endeavor to understand evolution from as many perspectives as possible and this is a book that weighs heavily on that purpose. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-01

As the title implies, Watson is describing his own subjective mental picture of the people and events that led up to his and Francis Crick's ultimate Nobel winning discovery, a discovery that has stood the test of time. <br /> <br />Watson describes the personalities of the many people involved directly or otherwise. Though he uses kind words, it is apparent that different people and different times grated on him. He also describes his travels, academic frailties and personal loneliness. The latter while thinly veiled, was mentioned throughout the book. <br /> <br />Though there was description throughout the memoir, it was not burdensome to the non scientist. I used a dictionary about five times and had my much more scientific daughter explain some things to me. While there is academic jargon it was not burdensome. I was able to read the book in nearly one setting as it was written for the layman to spend a little time inside the thinking and personality of a true genius and a humble one at that.  <br /> <br />Those of us who did not study science when it was convenient but rue it today, can read this book and learn something about the history of one of the finest events in scientific discovery. <br />	2005-08-24

As a scientific \\"Jack of all trades\\", Bloom attempts to cover a tremendous amount of ground in order to explain how humanity got to where it is today. The book is filled with details and is very well documented but I could not help but to ask what came first. Did Bloom already have his own answer to the various ethno social questions he raises or was he testing a hypothesis? Unfortunately it appears to me that the former holds sway. <br /> <br />All good books in the realm of academic thought are well documented and this is done in order to assist the writer in securing their premise but it is also to provide a reader with additional reading for any of the points that they find compelling. As I read the book I selected several of his citations and followed up on them only to be disappointed in several cases as the author took the citation out of context. <br /> <br />While the book represents itself as a \\"Scientific Expedition\\" I found it rife with errancy that belies that name. The book is more a collection of anecdotal musing and reinforced by references. I enjoyed his concept of memes and found them more thought provoking than definitive. He also made bad premises that were nearly tautologies such as the fact that the US possessed about 40% of the world's goods in 1945. He also made some pretty fanciful leaps such as comparing TH Huxley to Christian martyrs and on several occasions extolled Rock and Roll music for its rebellious themes. I may have to apologize to millions of fans when I say that Rock and Roll music is about making huge amounts of money. There are no radical warriors with platinum records. <br /> <br />Well, the book reads well and does inspire some thought and further reading but it is not good science and it does not fulfill its titular claim. I almost recommend it. <br />	2005-08-12

Jared Diamond starts this book by asking a simple question. That is: Why are people of European descent so much more successful than the rest of the world? His answers to that are extremely well articulated but yet they are not particularly complex. They gainsay the obvious answer that may have (and often does) have racial overtones. Briefly the answer has nothing to do with genetics.    Diamond goes to wonderful detail to describe how natives of Africa, New Guinea or South America have to live their lives in desperate conditions and the ingenuity that is required to survive. To boil a lengthy thesis into a few words he would say that the environmental conditions for different peoples spelled their destiny. \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves\\"    The book outlines a very basic point that prevails throughout history and that is they who control information technology rule the world. I have firmly believed this for many years and reading Diamond's book strengthened that thought.    In the earliest days that technology consisted of the tools to hunt which led to storing wild crops which led to agriculture which led to communities and writing and disease and war and more. The picture is not always pretty. It is real. Other ethno-biologists may disagree with his premise but they cannot deny that Diamond's thinking is very fruitful in understanding humanity and our history.    The cultivation of food led to great societies over the history of humans and that led to some of the most significant governments and therefore dominant armies and then of course, international domination. The reason some areas were able to tame wild plants into vegetables and animals into domestication are purely environmental according to Diamond. The environmental factors include the number of animals that could be domesticated either for food or work and the amount of wild harvest that could be used in agriculture.    These factors varied profoundly over the earth and were certainly affected by climactic conditions. Europe had the most favorable conditions for this and that led to the creation of communities and ultimately to dynasties and world domination. The United States was formed as a residue of that fact.    Despite the geo-economic factors that distinguish the \\"First World\\" from any others, there is no genetic factor that suggests that they are intellectually inferior. To some extent those of us from the \\"First World\\" have had our world handed to us on a platter and we may be less ingenuous than our \\"Third World\\" compatriots. This is a notion worth contemplating.	2005-08-10

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	4	21	26	N	N	Think about it...What happened	What's the Matter With Kansas? by Thomas Frank New York, Owl Books. 2003 322pp. ISBN 0-8050-7774-X <br /> <br />Like Thomas Frank, I grew up amongst white, blue collar people during reasonably prosperous times. The war in Viet Nam was raging as were its opponents; Political assassinations were rampant and the Civil Rights Movement was in its heyday. At the same time wages were rising and jobs were fairly plentiful and the unions strong. There was a liberal mind swell across the nation. Words like \\"nigger\\" were no longer spoken in public regardless of the individual's personal feelings. Roe v. Wade was passed and fathers who fought in Korea and WWII were beginning to speak out against the war in Asia. What has changed? Thomas Frank has provided a rational explanation that is worth thinking about. <br />   <br />One very germane question has been posed in his book. Why have the people who have the most to lose financially, taken to support the right wing agenda of our political leadership so strongly? The answer is that the morally relevant political leadership in this country have pandered to the basest features of this population and that is to their emotions. Those in the most precarious of financial situations are willing to risk their own future for their bosses. They take up causes like abortion (focusing on anecdotal reports about late term atrocities, or women who have had 6 abortions). They support Intelligent Design despite the lack of quantitative evidence it provides. They decry the inability to place the Decalogue in public places despite the notion that as conservatives and patriots they might want to conserve the First Amendment. <br /> <br />Why do people whose livelihood is at stake, risk what little resources they have in some cases or simply support candidates who do not have their sake in mind in others? Frank suggests that they are dupes to the moral relevancy of the political leadership. He makes a good case for that. With the exceptions of fringe lunatics like \\"Pope Michael\\", these supporters of the new Republican agenda are hard working, sane people. They are friendly and sociable, they drink a beer at the church social, make their own barbeque sauce, attend PTA meetings and virulently rant about the failures of modern society. <br /> <br />Essentially they are dupes, or so posits Frank. They are dupes because the political leadership needs their votes and is willing to indulge their most base fears. Specifically those fears include \\"Liberal Northeast\\" imposition into their private lives. Their own Republican leadership has convinced them that what is square is actually round.   <br /> <br />Republican leadership in the chosen state of Kansas (Frank's home state) has created a myth that the enemy is the \\"elite\\" from New England and the Mid Atlantic. Those liberal politicians do not have the working person's interests in mind, rather, they are opportunists who seek to take advantage of the morality that the working class gets in their churches. <br /> <br />Working people are buying into this myth in huge numbers despite the disingenuous appeals of people like Sam Brownback. The Republican leadership of Kansas is  Blueblood. It is as simple as that. They call themselves farm boys not unlike our Commander in Chief but they are not. They appeal to the religious sensibilities of their constituency despite their own private lackluster morality. They know how to give the speeches and glad hand the soldiers in their drive to continue in their pursuit of National Glory.  They want to be remembered as great statesmen (people) and the road to that fame is the little man. <br /> <br />This \\"backlash\\" ideology is not new and Frank recognizes that. It is fueled by a disconcertment amongst the vox populi. Their values are in question and that is not what they want. They in fact want a sublime life in which people get along and government does not tell them what to do at home. Their leadership wants to tell them what todo at home but does not want them to know it. Therefore an intense effort is made by Republican, east coast educated, silver spoon people (mostly men) to dissemble reality and present themselves as the representatives of the working person. These same leaders funded by the large agribusiness in Frank's scenario, have no pity when it comes to lay offs or golden parachutes for CEOs, when it comes to the rank and file. The people who will get laid off and be forced to work for $5.15 an hour instead of the barely livable $13.50 they made at the cannery are their voters.  <br /> <br />How does the leadership do it? They simply redirect the issues away from politics and economics. They play to the workers emotions. It is not the employer who is doing you wrong, it is the effete Eastern Liberals who are playing you like a fool. Of course there is no basis for this. The Kansas Republicans were educated in the same schools and came from the same social status as those snobbish liberals that they portray. A reasoned and rational person could see this. Why do the workers fail to see it? The answer is simple, their leadership has painted a portrait of the Liberal as a mortal enemy who will with disingenuous relish, try to ply the worker into their camp. The God Fearing and patriotic Republican leader on the other hand, can understand your plight. As a \\"local farm boy\\" they know the hardships you endure. It matters little whether they have picked up a hoe. What matters is that they use the local jargon and depict the \\"Liberals\\" as satanic. <br /> <br />Frank points this out in poignant detail. He describes current times and how various silly notions like Intelligent Design are winning subscribers. He very cogently describes how social and economic animus can be re-directed against the wrong enemy. The same leadership that can acclaim agribusiness  employee lay off as sound practice while their constituency seeks public benefits can rail against welfare. <br /> <br />Yes to those of us who can think rationally this is delusional. It is idiotic. Unfortunately, it is real.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-06-16

It is too often used to explain away things that are not understood and allows the postmodernist to smirk at empiricism. David Detmer's book has reinforced that idea.  <br /> <br />The book is very readable with jargon and technical terms explained. The book's high points include a thorough critique of many leading philosophical scholars of today including Richard Rorty who is taken to task in an entire chapter. Detmer's chapter, \\"What is Objectivity\\" while perhaps overlong with examples, provides an important insight into the mass media. His largest contention is that the media is fettered by the 2 party political system. There is essentially no fair and balanced option if the only issues that can be presented are the ones positioned by either the Democratic or Republican parties. <br /> <br />Another chapter, \\"The limitations of Rationality and Science?\\" is also poignant in its ability to explain the OJ Simpson trial results and how postmodernism raised its head.  <br /> <br />Detmer's strong defense of scientific thinking and his debunking of so many popular scholars makes the book valuable but there are some nadirs. Primarily too many of his points are repeated so often that some terms simply become cants. Subjects like \\"Self Referential Inconsistency\\" or the objective reality that Giraffes are larger than ants, while valid are very overdone and became tiresome to this reader. <br /> <br />Over all this is a great book to read if you want a method to counter post modern thinking. Quite frankly you should. <br />	2005-06-06

She offered her own opinions and explanations of the theories.  -She provided about 30 pages of specific notes for the researcher who uses this book.  -Most importantly this book is very funny. Dr. Judson clearly understands the mass media and by presenting her detailed account of the natural history of mating as a Television host will keep a smile on the reader's face with an occasional guffaw.    Dr. Judson has provided maybe the best example of popular science writing. The lay reader can easily understand every concept she presents. This reviewer did find two relatively minor issues with the book. In the first example, Judson did not provide her own commentary but merely presented the state of affairs. The second may simply be a question borne out of the reviewer's ignorance.    On page 108, Dr. Judson describes the Hawaiian Monk Seals and the very brutal method that the males use to restrict feebler males from mating. She indicates that the \\"problem is so acute that male seals are being rounded up and given drugs to suppress their libidos in an attempt to save the species from extinction\\". The issue here is whether it is ethical to save a species from its own extinction. It is easy to understand why we would want to prevent extinction if it is hastened by human intervention The question I raise is whether it is ethical to save a species that may die as a result of its own doing?    The second issue is specified on page 224 where there is a description of the many species of bdelloid rotifers who are asexual. Since \\"species\\" has been described by many famed biologists as an organism that can reproduce in the wild. If these rotifers do not mate, where comes the different species. It has already been mentioned that ignorance to the subject may be the cause of not understanding this.  [...]	2005-05-30

Since I am of the same camp the book did not reveal much in terms of new ideas to me. <br /> <br />That being said, for those that are not familiar with the author's work Dr. Pigliucci presents a case for rational, free thought in three sections. He mixes personal experiences such as his own debates with creationists, philosophical discussions and news events to present, well rational tales. <br /> <br />The first section describes the philosophical underpinnings that propel him towards evolutionary thinking. The second section, while still philosophical, addresses various religious arguments and the combination of those two sections result in the third. He describes his own debates with William Lane Craig and Duane Gish, both prominent figures for the creationist side. This is a formidable task and having heard two of Pigliucci's debates I can attest to much of his descriptions. His opponents have to continually resort to irrational arguments but they often do it with a smugness that could incite violence. Those of us who fight this battle have to thank those who use this forum. Keep up the good fight. <br />	2005-05-24

It is written with illustrations on every page making it a lot like a comic book. It is very well done and detailed and this reviewer suspects it would be appealing to a young crowd who has an interest is science. It appears that it may also inspire and interest in science. The explanation of how evolution works and how integral to science this theory is, becomes the strong point of the book.     The fact that the authors proclaim that once evolution and natural selection is understood, the reader would have to abandon all religious thoughts. While that seems obvious to me it may imperil this book from a wider audience. Given that there are many people who understand and support the theory of evolution and maintain religious idealogy simultaneously I think the book may limit its audience to the \\"choir\\".     A better book would explain the theory, the obvious conclusions that sensible people see as a result of that theory and let the reader (student) decide for themselves whether this requires or negates a supreme being.	2005-05-24

Kant makes us look more closely at this concept. <br /> <br />Essentially he distinguishes between a moral that has \\"ends\\".

Coelho, one of pre-eminent novelists of Brazil, maintains a tradition of magical realism in this acclaimed and well sold book. It is a tale of young Santiago's journey. The physical journey takes him to many places in his own country, Spain as well as northern Africa and across the Sahara to the Pyramids where he seeks his fortune. His metaphysical journey is explained along with his travels. That journey is about his maturation and the insights he gains by his meeting so many fellow travelers. In this sense it is not unlike Candide.    The prose is beautiful and poignant. It makes the reader feel nearly dreamlike as Santiago, or \\"the boy\\" as he is usually referred to aspires to be a righteous man who does his duty while dreaming about what another life would be like. It reminds us of Paul Nizan's book of travels Aden Arabie. `To what end moving away?' is the question.    The prose, gorgeous as it is, represents a philosophy. Do we make our own decisions or let a supreme being make them. In this case it is a question of heeding the insight of strangers Santiago has met or relying on his own experience and intuition. Ultimately he uses a little of both. His quest is for romantic love but it is also to grow in wisdom and treasure.    He achieves his aims by heeding the seers he meets, talking to the wind and sand and sun. This is presented beautifully and reads well. It also is nonsense. This is a well phrased thoughtful book but the thoughts this reviewer came out with is that this is no way to achieve any dreams and hopes that he has.	2005-05-24

For reader response contact respectfulempiricist@yahoo.com <br /> <br />Like so many great thinkers, Heisenberg attempts to create a unifying philosophy about the sciences. He seeks to correlate human behavior and beliefs with physics. With scientific breakthroughs theories become more abstract and it makes it more difficult to understand. The lectures that form this book explain the events leading to his famous theory, the relevance of Physics to philosophy and the moral imperatives of scientists. <br /> <br />Werner Heisenberg, the renowned physicist and 1932 Nobelist, is remembered by most of us as the developer of the Theory of Indeterminacy.  Simply put, \\"The more precisely the Position (of a particle) is determined, the less precisely its Momentum is known\\" This Theory was developed in an intensive \\"Think Tank\\" conference that took place in Copenhagen in 1927.   <br /> <br />He describes of how the abstruse proofs of Physics (as well as other sciences) must be made comprehensible to lay people. The accelerated changes in the sciences are based on the ever increasing new information and discovery. This creates a cognitive dissonance in the public and a common way to deal with that mental rift is reactionary. The results of scientific thinking may contradict some of our common ideas as those ideas become beliefs rather than science. Through folklore or youthful and innocent experimentation or by other means we often come to understand aspects of the world that have no basis in reality. We want to cling to them in the face of sound theory. <br /> <br />The book is a complicated effort. Heisenberg wants us to be thinking of the impact of scientific advance on our society and values. His is a liberal perspective. This seems to be routine for the leading physicists who worked in early atomic fission. His presentation is not woven together neatly and the book requires rereads and extensive notes in order to make sense of it. The book also contains several different messages. Another reviewer may read the same book and find different aspects of it to be the kernel of Heisenberg's intent. <br /> <br />The fact that it is awkwardly compiled requires intensity on the reader's part. Ultimately it is felt that Heisenberg points are taken, are sincere and that he sought a better future based on scientific breakthrough and design.  <br />	2005-04-27

Humanists are described as atheists and as amoral more than any other way. This is despite the obvious moral relativity deviations including the invasion of Iraq under profoundly dubious premises. It is Humanists that are accused of having an \\"end justifies the means\\" mentality. <br /> <br />This Manifesto, signed by nearly 150 scholars worldwide, is a plan for an international culture of cooperation. It is futuristic including plans for the ecology, education, agriculture and manufacturing that includes all of mankind's participation. <br /> <br />This book reflects the thinking that a better world can exist once the greed of global business is tamed. In this regard it is utopian. That hope is unlikely to bear fruit in any of our life times. Yet, it needs to be stated. The world is guaranteed of no relief for starving and warring Africans, and underclass throughout the world or of the continued despoiling of our eco system without a statement like this Manifesto being made. <br /> <br />That being said, here are some things this book is not: <br />-An amoral screed designed to give people a reason to do what they wish. The Manifesto is replete with personal and national responsibilities for the betterment of all of us <br />-A call for Communism or Anarchy. There is no statement that is anti-capitalism only the run away corporate greed that provides us with the likes of Enron or bid less government contracts like Halliburton. <br />-Anti-Religious, the Manifesto calls for the end of all religious persecution and intolerance world wide. <br />-\\"Take from the rich and give to the poor\\", it requires all people to be given equal advantages and to return to society, the benefits of those advantages.	2005-04-01

Essentially it is about the fatuous nature of the \\"Baby Boom\\" generation. Anyone who can harpoon Elton John, Phil Collins and Billy Joel in one paragraph is ok by me. <br /> <br />The book however, promotes a methodology that I think is useless. Specifically, culture in terms of generations provides us with no useful information and nothing could possibly be changed by that effort. It would be more accurate for Queenan to describe the decayed culture (with some exceptions I agree) in terms the times. What we have today is the culmination of many \\"Generations\\" work. Thinking in terms of approximated age groupings really is pointless as (you already know this) there is always an overlap. <br /> <br />I found myself often laughing, wincing at my own self indulgence but not taking much of this to heart	2005-04-01

It is about the way we perceive things visually, in various contexts. He uses photographs and painted works primarily but ends the book by describing how we might view a field. Different sociological and psychological factors will temper what we interpret what we are seeing.<br /><br />Berger writes in a style that I enjoy, descriptive and without concern for the grammatical structure that the nuns taught me in elementary school. That is not to say it is poorly written, Berger does take some license with proper English. Still the florid prose is very entertaining to me.<br /><br />I agree with the political concerns that the author has but I do have a problem with his presentation. In particular he discusses the uses of visual images for propaganda and how art was manipulated by Nazi Germany. This is true but then he describes how art can be used to promote socially progressive ideology. In my own opinion propaganda is propaganda whether it is from the left or the right of the political spectrum.<br /><br />A second issue I take with this author is that he takes some pretty fanciful leaps in his determination of what some artistic ploy means. He described a series of sculptures that would be placed next to a wall. One side of the sculptures was flat. He determined that this was not due to their inevitable placement but to some other factor.<br /><br />My last issue has to do with presentation. Berger makes a lot of assumptions that are personal. They are undoubtedly a result of a lot of thinking, reading and discussing art. I do not necessarily think they are wrong. He does however, assume that he is correct. Several times this occurred when I was unable to see from his perspective at all. I think that suggestions and fanciful leaps can be appropriate in an art criticism reading. I suggest that the points would reach home more readily if they were phrased ala \\"...perhaps we could suggest..., or ...maybe one wayof interpreting the form is...\\" Berger instead uses polemic type phrasing such as \\"undoubtedly this is a result of...\\"<br /><br />For an interesting perspective, some historical information and thought provoking suggestions this is a very good read.	2005-04-01

It  includes: <br />* A discussion of the Scopes trial with William Jennings Bryan's final speech which is a critical  read for the understanding of the Creationist mindset. In 1925 Bryan was saying the same thing Creationists are saying now. The argument is based on faith and not on a theory facts derived from over a century of scientific research.  <br />* The book proceeds to the history of the science/ religion discussion including a continuum of thought from \\"Flat Earth\\" believers to scientific adherents. Included here is a discussion of Hume's Dialogues in which he disproves Intelligent Design.  <br />* Creationists have long been guilty of muddying the waters of the discussion by using a pseudo science to bolster their claims. He discusses Intelligent Design which suggests that a force more powerful than humans created the world. Pigliucci renders the arguments impotent The arguments of  William Dembski, Phillip Johnson and Michael Behe are successfully refuted.  It is done it without malice but with authority. He discusses argumentative fallacies on the part of both sides. His discussion here is not hard on Creationist fallacies and easy on Evolution. <br />* There is an entire chapter on the dangers of anti-intellectualism fueled by radio talk shows that essentially says that intellectuals cannot see the forest for the trees and that is when likes of O'Reilly can point Americans in the right (literally) direction. <br /> <br />I do take issue with the description of Nowak, Page and Sigmund's study-\\"Ultimatum Game\\" to show how Mathematical evolutionary theory applied to ethics. Were this game played by a rich (proposer) and the responder poor, out of desperation, the responder may accept a much lower percentage as it would be better than nothing? This is similar to some labor/management disputes especially involving weak or nonunion employees. There are flaws in that comparison but it certainlyhappens that businesses are shut down at the owner's loss (as well as the wages of the workers) but ultimately, it is the workers who suffer more, often a total loss off employment while it is rare that a business actually shuts down as a result of a contract dispute.  <br /> <br />The book ends with a call to praxes. Now that we know all of this, what do we do with it? The author makes suggestions for the teaching of science in our schools. The most important point is that our youth ought to be taught critical thinking. It is having critically thinking educators determine what our children are taught. Education must be a concrete thing and not left up to those with an ideological axe to grind. <br /> <br />The last chapter of this book is important. To live in a society where people are thinking creatively and with discernment then we must have schools that provide the environment for that. Without that we have graduating students who basically know only how to do what they are told. <br /> <br />The book doesn't simply preach to the choir. Pigliucci relates fallacious thinking and smugness amongst his academic peers. He has created the kernel for deep and valuable discourse. He also is not above the use of well timed wry bits of humor that make the reading stay interesting.  (a longer review can be found at [...]	2005-04-01

Hume speaks mostly about how a deity would function as the head of the world. The reviewer is not intent on being cute here. Hume addresses many notions about \\"God\\" through a series of dialogues amongst three intellectuals. They are intent on convincing each other of their individual views. Essentially those three have to come to terms with the anthropomorphism associated with the God of Christian belief system. It really is more complicated than that but this is a short review. <br /> <br />In addition to the Dialogues are a short essays on the Immortality of the Soul and the rationality of Suicide. Finally there is a discussion of Miracles. The latter three are well placed with the Dialogues as they address the philosophy of religion in much the same manner but come from Hume rather than the fictional characters of the Dialogue. <br /> <br />This book as short as it is, requires a considerable amount of time to consume. Not only are the concepts that Hume presents detailed and valuable, but the language is particularly arcane and often requires re-reading in order to understand where Hume is going.	2005-04-01

Why animals (including humans) make our sexual preferences real and what behaviors we use in order to mate and thus continue our biological lineage. <br /> <br />The Red Queen takes its title from a general evolutionary theory that can be described briefly. A species evolves to meet its current survival needs. The lion develops better jaws or is faster based on an \\"improved\\" musculature or its scent improves. The details are not important. The lion becomes a better hunter.  <br /> <br />At the same time its prey also develops evolutionary \\"improvements\\". The gazelle may become more camouflaged, or be able to leap higher etc. and again the details are not important for this purpose. As the lion improves its ability to hunt its prey that same prey develops abilities to elude the hunter. Essentially with evolutionary changes, there is no distancing the hunter from the prey or visa versa. <br /> <br />Like the Red Queen indicates in the Alice and Wonderland tale, the faster you run the more everything stays the same. As the prey, the more you develop to withstand your predator the more your predator develops their \\"capture\\" skills. This describes the point of Matt Ridley's Red Queen. Everything evolves but the world gets no closer to \\"solving\\" its many dilemmas. <br /> <br />This book is an enjoyable and thought provoking book. Ridley introduces a tremendous number of theories to corroborate his notions and often tells the reader why he rejects them. This left the reviewer wondering if Ridley was teasing us with ideas but leaving us with little that was conclusive. That appears to be the case but the author does not offer anything but his Red Queen theory as the point of the book. <br /> <br />The many theories and references force the reader to investigate further in order to develop their own understanding. Ridley offers plenty to choose from. The reader can enjoy this book for its references and suggestions but it would be hard not to enjoy the prose that includes many subtle pieces of humor. He suggests at one point that a peahen reading this book might disagree with him. While the reviewer is not so sure the peahen would disagree he does feel confident that reading this book will enlighten a person and provide them with ideas to pursue for further investigation.	2005-03-21

When Sagan was alive doing his PBS shows this reviewer did not watch them. He had determined that Nova would be a dumbed down science program not unlike the contents of a Pschyology Today article. An apology is required but to who? Perhaps to the reviewer who had too much hubris to pay attention and short shifted himself. He is a wiser reviewer now. <br /> <br />Cosmos is a book written for the mass market and can be found in your local grocery store. The value here is that any one can pick it up very inexpensively and explore a plethora of scientific ideas in a deep yet readable way. Many of us do not have the training and skills that allow us to understand the details of a scientific study. Sagan provides us a history that is there for the everyman who yearns for information. <br /> <br />Sagan presents his case with some biography such as Kepler and Newton. Some evolution, autobiography and some cosmology. For us scientific little leaguers he presents all of his ideas from a scientific method. Nothing in science happens (or happened) without intelligent hypotheses, testing and review by people who understand the tests and can offer something to them. <br /> <br />The book is written in an engaging style that is florid enough to keep the reader interested even in the moments that may seem arcane. Should the reader stick with those moments they will be satisfied with a clear answer to their question.  <br /> <br />A book like this has been in print since 1980. People must be reading it. Those that have are rewarded with ideas and reasons to pursue new adventures in science as a result.	2005-03-21

Scientific Knowledge is a primer on how the role it plays in overall thinking and philosophy. There is more to establishing an ideology than science and it needs to work in conjunction with the arts for example. The second section is the \\"How To\\" of the Scientific Method and the third is a scary portrayal of how a purely scientific world society might end up. It was originally published about the same time as 1984 and Brave New World all three of these writers obviously saw the potential risk of what Russell describes as science for power's sake rather than for the love of knowledge and learning. <br /> <br />Many years ago I read much if not all of these essays about the value of the Scientific Method (or Technique as he says). I was won over and as a student of Social Sciences I attempted to use the method to the best of my ability. I also appreciated his socially liberal outlook that can be seen throughout. Years hence, upon re-reading the book I find that I still appreciate the writing but I have been inured in my thinking that the world will be a better place with the Scientific Method playing a larger role in policy making. <br /> <br />Some of Russell's sentiment of 1931 does not play that well today, such as his tempered admiration for the USSR but many others should his prescient thinking. Those incident's were many but I will only present one and that is because I saw it as true but funny in a melancholy way.

Their notes have been transcribed into this brief compendium that was designed for beginners, for those not educated in Physics. This reviewer purchased the book in order to accomplish a simple goal. That was to get a grasp on the minimum essentials of this course of scientific study.  <br /> <br />Prior to reading the book the reviewer had seen a play called The Proof by David Auburn. The play described how solving an intense mathemetical equation was not unlike art or poetry. The intent was poignent and left the reviewer humbled but interested in learning more. Feynman's intent was similar to Auburn's. There is beauty in the equation, once it is understood. <br /> <br />Initially it was felt that readin this series of lectures was a failure. The reviewer felt no more adept at discussing Physics than before. Prior to writing this brief the notes were reviewed and there were six handwritten pages the reviewer had taken. That is quite a bit for such a small book. The notes were reviewed and it was discovered that quite a lot was actually learned. It would be nice to say \\"I know a lot about Quantum Mechanics\\"* in fact only some morsels were remembered and noted.  <br /> <br />The value of the book for us beginners is that it is written in a very fluid style with many simple analogies that make it understandable and it can be referred back to for clarification and those areas that the reader wants to expand their knowledge on can be pursued. <br /> <br />This reader is never going to be a Physicist but has come away with some basic knowledge that can only help in understanding a future read on the subject. <br /> <br />* There is an oft quoted maxim that goes something like this, \\"Anyone who says that they know a lot about Quantum Mechanics knows very little about Quantum Mechanics\\". Well, this reader recognizes that he knows little.	2005-03-21

Although it is nearly 700 pages and as a hardback weighs about 5 pounds, that is not what is meant by big book. It is large because it sets out to explain how we humans came to be through a 3 billion year journey. Reading the book requires rigor and careful attention to the details. Dawkins is writing to a popular audience in the sense that he explains scientific technicalities so that those readers (like this one) who have limited biology backgrounds can begin to understand things that occur in this journey. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This is a pilgrimage as the title explains and it is patterned after Chaucer's CanterburyTales. The books takes us through a series of 39 Rendezvous. It travels from today back to what can be figured as the beginning of heredity or more specifically the first replicator gene. At each Rendezvous, Dawkins and Yan Wong travel with the last common ancestor (concestor as Dawkins says) to the next rendezvous where we all meet and head to the next rendezvous. This goes on for 3 billion years and the adventure is well told all the way through. If the reader has seen the movie, Allegro non Troppo they may recall backward time travel to the sound of Ravel's  Bolero while reading this book. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Throughout these travels Dawkins digresses to explain the science behind his descriptions. This is a crucial aid to those who need some help with understanding. Without these digressions only biologists could read the book. He also digresses with political asides. This reviewer particularly enjoys them and that is in large part due to the similarity of our ideology. Many people have written that Dawkins can be supercilious but this did not occur to the reviewer and perhaps that is due to a similar personality trait. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The book uses a methodology of convergence that is critical in making a case for what appears obvious to the thinking individual. Unfortunately, the theory of Evolution requires constant re-proving. Evidence which has been overwhelming for the last 150 years is still subject to \\"debate\\" for a contingent large in numbers, who have attempted to erode the credibility of this science by locating little chinks in the over all armor. Briefly, convergence is the making of inductions from classes of facts that may be disparate in and of themselves and making strong scientific cases for each class. Once that is done the convergence of all of these explanations makes an extraordinary case for the over all objective. In this case the objective is that the theory of evolution is once again, strong and obvious. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Dawkins credits many scientific minds throughout the book to assist him in explaining how he came to conclusions that he arrived at. The scientific veracity is thorough and of course documented well. Several authors and books struck this reviewer with a desire to read them and they are found in the Side Bar. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />While preparing for this review, several scientific pieces of information were gathered and reviewed but in the actually writing of this, they were determined to be too cumbersome and too subjective to use. Suffice it to say that were the reader of the Ancestor's Tale a less sophisticated scientist, the book provides extensive data to support his convergence of evidence and is readable enough so that any reader can gather a general understanding of the concept Dawkins is explaining. To go into more detail would not only give away the story but would be repeating nearly verbatim, what he details in the book.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />So...rather than give away the ending, you should read the book. Ultimately it is a good story. The prose is there to keep up the interest in anyone who is interested in science despite a paltry background. The book once read entirely, can also serve as an excellent reference book. It can be used to return to for further clarification and to jolt the memory that fades over time. Thinking scientifically does not make anyone a scientist. Those readers who are not, can make use of this book in more than one way. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />In the end, Dawkins looks at the journey back into time with amazement and reverence. Life evolved out of nearly nothing and led to things like humans understanding it. It is a \\"Reverence for life itself\\" <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-02-01

Penguin Books. 1958.  <br /> <br />In any review, the reader has to be compelled to have an interest in the subject. What is it about this 800 year old story that would interest the reader? I had always believed that this book was an adventure story about the first European explorer into the mid east and China. I do not know where this notion came from but on both counts, it is wrong. I picked it up and read it because I continually see references from other modern, authors. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />What is compelling about the book is the writer's anthropological approach (however primitive) to viewing the societies that were racially and culturally different from the upper crust European society he was raised in. There is a generosity of spirit in this book that will be detailed more further down. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />It should be noted that like, Benvenuto Cellini's Autobiography, this book features hyperbole if not out right fantasy throughout. There is more than one version of The Travels as well. This book is not written in the first person as it actually is an \\"As told to\\" account that apparently was \\"told to\\" more than one transcriber. There has been much debate over the years about its veracity but that is for someone else to write about. I chose to read this book as if it were fact and not to fret over the overall truth or its details. That being said lets get into the story. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Over a period of about 24 years, the young Marco Polo joined his merchant father and his uncle in pursuit of the expansion of their mercantile trade into new regions. This concept should be familiar to any reader who reads about venture capitalism and Red China today. The dynamics may differ but the logic is the same. While this effort led the Polos to discover spices, material and trade routes, it also provided Marco, the opportunity to explore and log his experience with new cultures.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />He ispretty magnanimous in his descriptions of the peoples he met as he traveled from Asia Minor through cities we hear about today such as Hormuz and Baghdad onto China (known then as Cathay) and into parts of Mongolia and Russia. I say that he is big hearted because he added very little value judgment in relating his experience with these cultures. Unfortunately, he limited what he could describe to a small variety of things. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Religion was broken into three categories. There were Christians (he did break them into a few groups such as Nestorian and Greek Orthodox), followers of Mahomet (Islam) and Idolaters (the rest). In some cases though few, he describes the cultures as having no religion as unlikely as that is. It is my suspicion that they were not devout peoples or their customs were too unusual for Polo to understand their worship. He did not render serious value judgments to the religions that were not Christian though he sort of favored that belief system. Specifically, the heroes of battle between people of differing religions was biased toward the Christians just as the performance of any miracles was. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Polo described the Great Kings, such as Kublai Khan and the lesser kings who gave allegiance to the former. This was important to him and was noted ad nauseum. He had  great respect for Khan including the addition of a Genealogical Chart at the end of the book. He wrote of the Emperor's largesse-assisting the poor, providing examples of fair play and Solomon like wisdom. He also described the ruthless ability to hold power, destroy his enemies and land/nation plundering. He describes these latter events without a hint that anything was wrong with that. Perhaps at this juncture in history, Khan's methods were more civil and humane than the kings in Europe. Based on the North American conquests and slaughtering of Natives 200 years hence, this would seem possible. In my own opinion, the description of Khan reads something like Mario Puzo's Godfather. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Another area of special interests lies in Polo's interest with the spices, foods, material for clothing and adornment as well as native wood and building styles. This makes sense because that was Marco's career. He was a merchant. He describes in detail, the reasons different techniques were used to build a ship for instance. The description shows that he had a rudimentary scientific method and imparted that to the reader by explaining why certain procedures were performed based on supplies, climate and water conditions among other things. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Polo was a man of the world and that is obvious by his travels but he was clearly educated well. He brought to his journeys and writing, a skill and perception that would only be a result of solid education. His minimal judgmental phrasing also suggests to me that he saw the world as a big place and was not fettered by provincialism that might be expected from an upper crust 13th century European. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />It is important to note however that the book reveals some of the Magical Realism that undoubtedly prevailed largely in his time. He believed in miracles, reported them on a second hand basis and claimed to see a few himself. It seems again, that by imagining the times and place that this was written, it would be nearly impossible to write a book that denied miracles. He does however toss a tiny bit of skepticism when describing a faith healer (a non Christian one of course). \\"You must not suppose that because I speak of `Diabolic Art' that that is their account of the matter: They attribute their knowledge to the power of the gods working through a medium of their art\\". He continues to describe these healers having ready made answers when their \\"cure\\" fails and of course it is Divine. Perhaps Benny Hine was acquainted with this book. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Polo was fairly interested in the sexual practicesof these cultures and he reported some of the more lurid ones. In several cultures that he visited he found that the practice of entertaining visitors (of which he was one) by providing them with the sexual favors of their wives, sisters, nieces etc. The men would make the introductions and then depart to some distant retreat while their dear ones essentially prostituted themselves for the visitors satisfaction. He ended one such description by indicating that a man of 16 to 24 would find such a visit much to their liking. This made me wonder how Polo himself liked it but he did not mention such. Another thing to wonder, based on frank discussion of this and details of a pregnancy test in one of his towns, whether sexuality and the Christian's 6th commandment was considered as taboo as it was in say the Victorian Era. I don't know, it is just a thought. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The reader can enjoy this book for the fantastic descriptions of unicorns (probably rhinos), enormous and scary beasts (probably crocodiles) and men with tails. The reader might enjoy the descriptions of royalty which is one place that hyperbole abounds, for instance it is not uncommon for the story to pronounce that some king had thousands of concubines and thousands of servants and hundreds of thousands of soldiers for single battles. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The reader might also notice miracles which are plentiful, stories about hens with no feathers, cannibalism and people who live for 150-200 years. They might also marvel at the science that did prevail at the time. There is a description of a messaging system that is easily comparable to America's own Pony Express. Likewise the details of a sewer system that essentially matches our more modern ones, the logic behind curfews and birthing customs all suggest something of interest to me. Specifically, while technology has grown at an extremely rapid pace, people and their logic and belief systems have not really changed dramatically. Nearly, if not all stories that Polo related, have easy counterparts to something or someone that is visible in the media today. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />There is a down side of this book. Previously it was mentioned that  the veracity of The Travels was subject to question. Apparently in Asian historical chronicles there is no mention of this Italian visitor though there is mention of other European guests. He also describes many societies the same, almost verbatim. This may be due to very little difference between one culture and another or perhaps Polo simple cheated and threw in information that he did not have first hand (a little like the ever growing band of journalists, historians etc. that get revealed regularly in our current world). <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Perhaps the most significant negative comment that could be said about this book is that by our 21st century standards it is just very poorly written. At times it is simply torturous to wade through a meaningless and repetitive description. The book is also written much like we talk. By that I mean phrases like ...\\"I nearly failed to mention...\\" are used throughout. Of course in our day the forgotten piece would simply be edited into its correct location and there would be no need for the brief apologetic line. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />I assigned this book to myself for this book review. I enjoyed it despite its flaws and quite frankly, it may be all the fantasy of Polo or his transcriber, but I think the book gives us some insight into the 13th century mind of a learned traveler. For that it passes the litmus test of worthwhile reading. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-02-01
