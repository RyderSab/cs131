The link between these two setting is the 80-year -old Bettina Whitelaw, now an eminent writer living in England, but originally from the backwater town of Bundaroo in Australia. Early on we know that something bad is going to happen (her friend Hughie expresses anxiety about the motives of Bettina's friends and associates.  He suggests they are after her money.) We also know something bad did happen to Bettina in the past, a crime which bit by bit is revealed. <BR>Neither revelation is meant to be particularly startling. There are enough hints leading up to each event, that it is apparent that surprise is not Barnard's intent.  This would not necessarily be a bad thing if the characters and dialogue were compelling, but they are not.  Bettina has a decidely unemotional sardonic personality which is pretty much matched by the visitor Sylvia who plays an important role in the former's life.  All the educated characters speak in one way, all the uneducated macho characters speak in another equally predictable way.  My other disatisfaction comes from the plot device gradually revealing an Event from the Past.  It makes pleasure in the immediacy of reading subordinate to finding out what the Event is.  This becomes especially irritating when the Event (a crime) and its perpetrator (named on the last couple pages) are entirely predictable.  There are lots of mysteries out there.  I would not waste my time with this one.	2004-05-22

Its greatest value is the high calibre of master drawing examples by everyone from Michelangelo to Rembrandt and Watteau, as well as appropriate and sensitive student examples.  Mr. Goldstein breaks down the approach to drawing into contour line, structural line, shape, gesture, volume, combination drawing.  The book is dense with writing as this is largely a verbal analysis of visual issues in which each drawing example is discussed in a very detailed manner.  Some may find the approach too verbose, and indeed this is not a &quot;how-to-draw&quot; book in the &quot;Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain&quot; category, but more of a guide to conoisseurship and the philosophy of drawing. In fact, there are precious few exercises described for the student.  I think that for the drawing student who does not have the benefit of a teacher, this book paired with a more practical &quot;how-to&quot; guide  would be a terrific resource.  This is the kind of book you will find yourself dipping into over the years.  I always have it on an easy-to-reach shelf.	2004-04-16

This is one of the most memorable books I used as source material.  Usually a treatment of Impressionism will write of it as a movement in response to the paintings of the Academy; an inquiry into  the play of light and instantaneity.  Fine, fine, but how many books do we really need that say the same thing ?  This book looks at changes in the architecture of Paris which changed the city from a network of villages into a web of wide boulevards and massive, sometimes monotonous buildings.  People (many of them young) were moving into the city and feeling the displacement and dehumanization which we usually associate with depictions of Victorian era London.<br />Herbert spends a good bit of time looking at the clothing of individuals portrayed in paintings to ruminate about their social standing.  His keen eye for gesture picks up a lot.  Looking at an outdoor cafe scene by Manet, he notices that the young man at the table with a woman is actually kneeling next to her, not seated there.  From this he infers that the man is trying to pick up the jeune fille.  The rather prudish look on her face seems to confirm that this is what's happening.<br />The copious illustrations are wonderful.  Many are of paintings which are infrequently reproduced in art books.  There are also a lot of works  by Gustave Caillebotte whose compositions are so fascinating.  The writing is lively. I think this is a terrific book for a lover of Impressionism and/or a lover of Paris.  It's a wonderful fusion of images and prose.  I'm just so glad to find it available at such a reasonable price.	2004-02-17

For Bordeaux, Rhone and Languedoc I believe he is excellent.  For California and NW United States wines, the book is helpful but also frustrating because so many of the entries are &quot;cult&quot; wines with 500 or so case production. I noticed that some of the more widely available California producers that were included in the fifth edition are left off of this one.  While many of the French wines are available in a good wineshop--good luck finding any of the Calfornia ones he raves about.  If you start now, you may be able to get on some of the winery mailing lists in five or ten years.  In many cases the amount of wine produced is not mentioned, which can be a cause for frustration.<br />I think this book is an invaluable resource used in connection with other guidebooks and a trustworthy retailer.  It's a truism that Parker is the most influential wine critic in the world.  Many would argue that wineries are crafting their wines to win his high ratings.  That being said, it's helpful to read his views as they give a clear snapshot of the state of winemaking in our era.	2004-01-26

She delves into her main characters/suspects and reveals them (usually) as psychically wounded.  As often she creates sketches of minor characters.  For example, a very minor scene depicts in great detail the relationship between the two women working at a clothing resale shop .Their importance to the plot is based on their  receiving a consignment that includes the purse of one of the victims, but the amount of time devoted to them goes well beyond their significance in terms of plot.  I can only think that James is fascinated by people for their own sake, with the murder mystery serving as a pretext for her  psyco-social portraits of people living/surviving in 21st century England.<br />On the other hand, she is much more circumspect when it comes to the motivations of major characters. Without giving anything away, I will say that I found the behavior of the first (and primary)victim to be cryptic. At the end,  the motives of the murderer are also rather vague and ultimately left to the reader's interpretation.  <br />Some people love Dame James' approach to mystery--there is a palpability to the surroundings, to people's living and work spaces.  There is a depth to the suspects and the detectives.  If you are intrigued by all this, you probably know who you are and will enjoy Murder Room.  If, on the other hand, you have a fondness for the Agatha Christie -185- page- or- less-whodunnit that gets you in and  gets you out, you'll probably find PD James plotting too slow.  If you have never read PD James, I would say this is a typical one, no better and no worse, so a good one to try.<br />Personally, I'll always read the latest novel by PD James.  To me, a sub-par PD James is still better than 90 % of the mysteries being written today.	2004-01-24

When many people think of Bordeaux they think of stratospherically priced wines.  Actually for every $400 bottle of Chateau Latour 2000, there is a wonderful $25 bottle by an unsung producer.  $25 may not be cheap, but if drinks like a $50 one I'm pretty happy.  This book helps me find those lesser-known producers.  <br />While Robert Parker certainly heaps praise on the most famous wines when they are worthy, he does not hesitate to criticize them when they fall short.  He constantly points the readers to great values.<br />The book is organized by region and then by chateau. For many of the chateaux there is a copious amount of information:  some history of the producer, a list of the wine's component grapes, and detailed descriptions of significant vintages for the last ten years..  Be sure to read the introductory sections for Parker's take on how richness of flavor is attained (strict pruning of vines, letting the fruit ripen, abstaining from filtering) and for much encouraging news about Bordeaux wine today.  For one thing, he says that while the price gap between First Growths and unclassifieds can be great, never has the quality gap been so narrow.  Great news for us bargain hunters !	2004-01-09

This is such a book.  If you know anything at all about Rick Bayless, you know that this isn't your Chi-chi's Mexican cooking.  Within the pages of this book you will find dishes of incredible depth and you will learn a lot about the culture that engendered this cuisine.<br />If the complicated main course items are rather daunting, the salsas are quite do-able.  By going through the salsa section I feel like my own cooking has gained a new syntax.  Whether this is going to be a frequently used cookbook depends on your ambition and of course the amount of time you can devote to cooking.  Even if you make a small fraction of the recipes, you will gain a lot of insight into Mexican cooking just by reading the book.	2003-12-05

It was a pleasant surprise to find that many of Susanna Foo's recipes have become standby's at home, for everyday cooking and for special dinners.  As others have written, the recipes fuse chinese and french cooking techniques.  Although there are occasionally difficult-to-find ingredients, more often than not the author provides substitutes.  Favorites are the soy-braised cornish hens (so easy and so flavorful) and the tea-smoked cornish hens.  There are plenty of seafood dishes, most served with delectable sauces that could be easily transplanted to poultry or pork dishes.<br />The writing style is engaging, with reminiscences of dishes the author ate or prepared as a childhood.

If you're going to buy just one Italian cookbook, in my opinion this should be the one.  The 20 odd pasta sauces alone would be enough to keep you busy and sated.  Marcella Hazan's brand of cookery is not the most showy.  I am constantly surprised how often I can prepare the dishes with ingredients I have on hand.  If you follow her instructions carefully you'll wind up with a marvellous alchemy:  the simplest ingredients yield the richest of flavors.  I would definitely pay attention to her description of ingredients as our American version of some of them (parmesan and ricotta come to mind) are decidedly different from what she intends.  I'll conclude by encouraging you to give the Chicken Cacciatore a go--the best ever.	2003-09-04
US	52511841	RAEG47PH5RHZK	0375414932	170170416	Any Human Heart	Books	4	4	4	N	N	I was immersed	When I finished reading this book,  I felt as though I really knew its main character, Logan Montstuart and I found myself  missing him.  As a fully realized personage, Montstuart may be right up there with Pickwick.  A major diffence of course is that Montstuart endures some heartbreaking losses along the way, and these leave deep marks as he lives through each decade of the twentieth century.<br /> So much in the book rang true to me.  Other reviewers have commented on  the vividness of Montstuart's encounters with personages and events through the  20th century.  To these remarks I can add that it makes perfect sense that a man educated in England, with a literary bent, would be skeptical of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline and other luminaries of abstract expressionism (those championed by critic Clement Greenberg who also gets a mention).  A decade or so later he is drawn to artists of a more narrative bent (Larry Rivers, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauchenberg).  I guess it's a sign of the breadth of Boyd's creation that you can approach this literary invention from so many angles.  I am sure that British readers and those that lived through the second world war would come away with other aspects that are most striking to them. <br />There is something exhausting about this book.  Boyd takes you to so many locales and puts his protagonist in so many different situations that sometimes I found myself wishing  that Montstuart would just stay put.  Still, it's a rewarding read, sometimes incredibly sad but also very rich.	2003-05-26

This type of writing does get a bit monotonous, but the content, the account of an almost famous writer from one of England's southern counties (before WW II) is very diverting.  Having achieved a modest success with her first diary, the Provincial Lady  is now invited to international literary conferences, but must cope with the fact that she is still an unknown, and is often forced to fake acquaintanceship with books she hasn't read. Although her literary agent waits eagerly for her latest book (necessitating the renting of a London flat in order to have uninteruppted time to write) she still  deals with an embarassing lack of funds in her bank account.  This oscillation between the trajectory of her career and the earthbound concerns of money and child-rearing constitute a major theme.  Anyone who has ever had to balance career and, say, laundry, will get a kick out of the conundrum. A witty read by an engaging writer equipped with senses of irony and absurdity. Imagine Erma Bombeck transplanted to 1930's England, and I think you'll get some idea of our heroine.	2003-05-14

Simple recipes, like roast chicken with lemon and rosemary and pan-fried steak turn out deliciously.  I must caution that the layout of the book--a point/counterpoint in which each chef presents his/her approach--results in a cumbersome book.  For example, directions for one dish may appear several pages later than its ingredients.  An accompanying sauce may be five, ten pages back.  It wouldn't be a bad idea to use those sticky bookmarks in advance of preparing the recipe.  The instructional photos could have been much better.  A photo showing how to extract a wishbone, for example, is confusing.  I would have liked to see more step-by-step series of photos since a single shot is often inadequate.  This is definitely a hybrid--part cookbook, part coffeetable  tome.  Therein lies the difficulty but also the enjoyment.	2003-03-22

Mentions of Teddy boys, stove pipe pants and coffee bars help establish the ambience.  I mention this, because some of Christies other forays into  youth culture of the sixties (The Third Girl, for example) seem uninformed and inauthentic.  This one is much more successful, probably because the narrator candidly describes himself as old-fashioned.  <br />Seemingly unrelated deaths are related, and the means is quite clever.  Peripheral characters are drawn more vividly than the young male narrater, but the pacing is good.  With so many mystery writers intent on writing Literature--which seems to demand a tome of 400 pages at minimum--it is refreshing to have such an enjoyable read in under 200.<br />Yet even with an economy of means, Agatha Christie makes interesting general observations about the criminal mind and the nature of evil.	2003-02-21

The impressive thing about the recipes included in Union Square Cafe's second cookbook is that the various flavors are distinct while working together.  For example, a pasta dish with gorgonzola and fresh corn requires that you simmer the husks in a broth--what an odd notion and what a great result !  <BR>I would say that the procedures are straightforward, but time-consuming.  These are recipes that you have to plan for; they are not last-minute, just home-from-work desperation dinners. With that in mind, these are tasty, perhaps even mind -(not to say waist-) expanding recipes.	2002-09-26

He discusses the sights of course, but also the sounds (the vendors characteristic cries, the modes of transportation), the smells ( garbage and sewage were a perpetual problem), and London's fog takes on a tactile character.<br />I could have done without the constant emphasis on a couple pet similes--London as body, London as theatre--which are repeated way too often. My other criticism is the way Ackroyd writes about the vast disparity between rich and poor. While the plight of the poverty-stricken is movingly described, he does not make clear why London in particular had such a huge population of homeless compared to other European capitols. He does describe the shock of French and Italians when faced with this poverty, but does not explain why there is such a difference. I was left wondering whether this was the result of social Darwinish or somethin else.I felt squeemish reading his broad conclusion that London &quot;needs&quot; its poor, meant,I am sure, in a philosophical sense, but still...	2002-07-31

That is to say, when it was clear that our son was just not ready at 2 years old, we were willing to wait and try again.  On the other hand, we did not want to wait until he was on the verge of kindergarten.  The wonderful thing about this book is that it gives parents choices that are in tune with those of the parents' and the child's personalities.  Honestly, it never would have occurred to me on my own that I could have our son in underpants 2 or 3 hours a day, gradually increasing the amount of time.  In my mind I had always thought that it had to be diapers all the time or underpants all the time.  This  &quot;trick&quot;  alone helped us enormously.  The anecdotes are well-selected and the book is concise enough for busy parents everywhere.  Our son was potty-trained in about 3 weeks.  Certainly his readiness had much to do with his accomplishment, but so did the advice given in this book.	2002-07-07

Adopted as an infant, Ms. Prager's daughter is five-years-old during the narrative, and has been coming to grips with being Chinese and American, and the daughter of a single white woman.  When I heard the author interviewed on NPR I felt that the daughter was much too young for such an emotionally demanding trip and after reading the book I am all the more convinced that this is true.  Not only does the daughter go to an orphanage (not the same one where she stayed ) but she is shown the bridge where she was abandoned.  Before the trip she had thought she'd been left at a hospital, small comfort but at least some comfort. Now the daughter must, at five years old, process the truth of her abandonment to the elements and to sheer chance. I find the psychodrama unleashed upon the daughter positively appalling, and I only hope that she has a therapeutic avenue available to her.	2002-01-31

In his mysteries I always enjoy his wit and sense of irony particularly as regards his characters' (both principal and minor) lack of self-knowledge.  In &quot;Death on the Downs&quot; Carol Seddons inadvertantly discovers a dismembered skeleton in a village near her town. Carol, a button-down (or at least a Burberry raincoat) type teams up with her free-spirited neighbor Jude to solve the case. What ensues is an exploration of the village's history and the interdynamics of its residents.  Brett describes the gentrifying of the village, including the takeover of the local pub by a countrywide hospitality chain. Humble cottages become yuppie showplaces and skyrocketing property values make living in the village out of reach for working class people who were born and raised there.  This class distinction  is one of the causes of the action that follows and makes for amusing moments. Of one of the new homes Brett wonders whether it really needed both a turret and a belltower.<br />The situation is ripe for satire and yet Brett's storyline is grim, quite possibly due to the focus on Carol who really is quite dour.  My sense is that Brett relishes characters with quirks and neither Jude nor Carol have many.  I found the mystery itself dissatisfying and can only recommend it for Brett's talent for description of the village and some of the peripheral characters.	2002-01-10

I cannot say that many of that magazine's article stay in my mind, but this one did.  It was written by The Soul of a Chef's author, Michael Ruhlman.  I recall a passage describing  prep chef who, after spending hours peeling fava beans, placed them in water that was not at a sufficiently rapid boil.  Keller told the chef to start completely over.This incident is included in Soul of a Chef and is an example of the way Ruhlman can select a moment which illuminates person's philosophy. It showed so clearly the lengths to which Keller will go to achieve perfection, and the high expectations he places on his staff.<br />Such characterizations would make this an interesting read even for the non-foodie--although it certainly helps if you have an interest in cooking.

The book is a chronicle of her relationships and experiences with various employers.  I fully expected that the various households would blend into each other but was delighted to discover how vividly the personalities were portrayed, and so they remained distinct.  Most memorable was the clothing designer with a constant finger on the call button, a mistrust of her spending habits and a penchant for draping her in fabrics to envision his newest creations.  Some may have a problem with the fact that Ms. Dickens took on the job as a lark and could return to her comfortable life at any time, but the fact is that she really was up to her elbows in the muck of a 1930's kitchen.  All in all, I found it a delightful read, although the final chapter which recounts a lecture on &quot;The Problem of the Servant Today&quot; is tedious and merely restates in an arid manner the &quot;problems&quot; so well-documented in the rest of the book.	2001-06-07

They are a household of aristocrats living on an estate in a Welsh seaside village. Despite the hostility that exists among them they are allied against the working class who are in ascendance, and whom they view as upstarts.  They also barely tolerate the summer tourists.  The narrative is unified by anticipation of a patriarch's death and by an annual cricket match that has become an &quot;us vs. them&quot; event.  Rose, who marries into the family is especially well-drawn.  Her casual cruelty in word and deed is often breathtaking.   For example, she serves fat-laden meals, redolent of cream and butter--killing with kindness.  The final tragedy is unexpected yet the logical outcome of the cruelty and weakness that have gone on before.  <br />My problem with the novel is that there seems to be no right way to behave according to Ellis.  The sister-in-law who speaks charitably of the working class comes off as condescending.  The household staff are drunk and sly.  The patriarch is portrayed as amoral and domineering.  As fine a word-weaver as she is, surely a writer of such intelligence could do more than expose the weaknesses of every character she creates.	2001-05-04

I had previously read her biography of Pym who was her colleague and friend.  So, perhaps it was not fair of  me to expect or hope for Pymean wit in the work of Ms. Holt. Certainly I found little of it. The main character,  Sheila Mallory is a likeable, if dim, amateur sleuth of the bumbling variety. Her various stabs at a solution to the murder of an assistant employed by the Bodlean Library are pathetic.  Ultimately, the mystery is easy to solve simply because  the list of suspects is so small.  The book would be pleasant enough given its Oxford setting, but was ruined for me by the depiction of homosexuals.  They are shown as scheming and cruel.  (Saying more about their motivations would constitute a spoiler.)  Strangely, a novel that seems intended as a pleasant read ends up as a mean-spirited exercise in cliched characters.	2001-05-02

To me, author Colin Dexter's magic act lies in the way he conceals the relative ordinariness of the crimes(and criminals) as we become entranced by Morse's poetic interpretations of them. In this installment of the series we are made privy to the angling of University dons as they vie to become Master of Lonsdale College.  There is somewhat less vividness in the portrayal of the academics than I would have hoped--the two competing wives, each with certain similarities to Lady Macbeth, are more compelling.  The relationship between Morse and Lewis is quite warm when compared to earlier books in the series, with Morse expressing his appreciation to Lewis in moving terms.   The ultimate resolution of the murder relies exceedingly on figuring the amount of time needed to commute between point A and B, which I found tedious.  What binds the whole are the personalities of Morse and Lewis.  Beyond that we see Morse contemplating life and death with pragmatism and romance, which is what ultimately makes this a haunting book.	2001-05-01

I have begun to wonder whether its success has marred the books.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the idea of Macbeth fooling a drugpin into believing he, Macbeth, is a big-time drug dealer is ludicrous-- all the more so since apparently it is Macbeth's sneer that causes this oh-so-convincing transformation.  The plot contrivance seems to this reader to be an excuse for a &quot;Macbeth Goes To Amsterdam&quot; TV episode.   All the more annoying is the way the initial crime victim becomes virtually forgotten for  2/3 of the book.  Why rate it as high as 3 stars ?  Well, there is just enough Scottish atmosphere and visits with recurring Lochdubh characters to merit a read for MC Beaton's fans.	2000-12-02

A main difference is the severity and sublimity of the Scottish landscape (so different from Miss Marple's St. Mary Meade !)  As a frequent reader of this series I was glad for a break from the Hamish-Priscilla romance as I find her to be extremely boring.  In this mystery we find Hamish at a dumpy B &amp; B, surrounded by a variety of guests each of whom might have murdered the most obnoxious one--the nag of the title.  Hamish's relationship with one of the guests,  a spinster retired schoolteacher is quite moving. .  She and the other characters show various sides of themselves.  If Beaton does not exactly probe her characters (I would look to PD James for that kind of thing), they at least have a certain substantiality due to the bits of personal history we learn of each. I thought the plot meandered a bit.  Hamish's travelling back and forth between Skaw and Lochdubh proved tiresome; we witness too many mental checklists of the various suspects' motives and opportunities.  Even so, it is a generally enjoyable book and the ending does indeed have a bite to it.	2000-11-27

The story takes place during the final year of World War II.  There are frequent changes in viewpoint and time period which became distracting.  It is clear that Spark is interested in the sound of words in all their richness and haphazardness, but the collaging strategy takes force from the final tragedy.  Lurking behind the narrative are a cast of characters possessing various degrees of egoism and spirtituality.  The most fully drawn is Jane, a young woman employed in &quot;the world of books.&quot;  One of her  unusual modes of employment is writing fake fan letters to living famous authors on behalf of a collector in the hopes of receiving  handwritten replies.  In her we find an idealized perspective on the literary world blended with pragmatism in her machinations.   Other personalities reside at the edge of the narration and their motivations are difficult to credit.  I am fairly sure that Spark is pointing out the ambiguities of our psyches, but she stacks the deck against any efforts we might make to discover what makes the characters tick.	2000-11-04
US	52511841	R3ALTCHCKS96ET	0684818922	447716228	The Singing Sands	Books	4	23	25	N	N	Terrific atmosphere	I think it was Robert Barnard that pointed out Tey's avoidance of the  &quot;play fair&quot; whodunnit--the type where a reader could deduce the  solution from clues given a la Agatha Christie.  That is certainly true  here.  Information is given to Inspector Grant by characters who are  introduced quite late in the book.  While these nuggets propel the  narrative and lead to a satisfying conclusion, this is not the sort of  mystery one could solve with the clues given.One reservation I have about  her writing is her use of extended interior dialogues for Grant.  They feel  contrived and stilted. Otherwise I found the book compelling, especially  due to the vivid atmosphere created.  After reading it I have become quite  interested in the Hebrides !	2000-08-03

The imagery and characterizations are laugh-inducing.  I still smile when I picture the family's wayward  washing machine adrift on a rowboat in the middle of Puget Sound.  What I  especially enjoy about this work is the descriptions of the mundane, of the  frustration of getting an old house in shape and finally the way she  embraces the absurdity of the struggle.  If you are in the throes of home  renovation this book (and probably her more famous The Egg and I) is a  wonderful antidote.  Also most enjoyable is the very genuine relationships  among the family members, particularly between the two adolescent  daughters.	2000-08-02
