You will note that many reviews on this book state at the bottom that their review is from the previous edition. <br />As if the book isn't stigmatizing enough I find a great deal of falsehoods in these reviews. Statements like bpds \\"are manipulative. It is a well kwown fact that this is not true and researchers in this field such as Marsha Linehan Ph.D. will tell you that.<br />Instead of promoting growth in this field and truly educating folks about this painful disorder; and instead of assisting the familes with how the author felt and coped during his marriage with someone with BPD. He shares none of his inner self.<br />In the book \\"Imbroglio\\" it states that no person with BPD is alike. How true! I have the BPD myself and can relate to 10% of how this BPD character in the book behaved and felt. There is no one set version of a person with BPD.<br />I encourage everyone to read everything about this disorder with a grain of salt unlesss they are a researcher and know the current research.<br />Author's arrogant depiction of his relationship with his Borderline wife. Author takes little responsibility for the death of the relationship and has zero insight into his own mental health issues that drew him into a destructive relationship and kept him there for some time. This lack of insight is common among Borderline partners who blame the Borderline for everything under the sun.<br />The author is described by his mother - \\"You have always cared for the very weakest, the most hopeless cases.\\" This line was used as an introduction in the book as to why he was attracted to this \\"borderline.\\" In other words, he is likening someone with the BPD as being \\"the very weakest, the most hopeless cases.\\" Not only was the author terribly wrong about the BPD, but it made me very angry. <br />He presentshis wife in this book as someone who cannot get better. He does not discuss treatment. He does not seem to have a real clue as to what the BPD really is and that is a neurobiological medical disorder. A brain disorder needing medication.<br />He discusses Gunderson's work which is good but old. It would have been helpful for the author to have done some recent research before writing the book to provide hope to families and borderlines. The book leaves one with a feeling of no hope and leaves families with thoughts that borderlines should be left.<br />It is important to note that not all borderlines are alike. His depiction of his wife and how the BPD is expressed in her life will be very different from another person with the BPD.<br />It was stated in the book that BPDs are manipulative which is incorrect. This was thought at one time but we know now is untrue. Here again, we look at the research and not at what others tell us.<br />This book is dangerous for borderlines and families to read because of the reasons above. Leads one to believe there is no hope, no treatment, BPD partner has no mental health issues and blaming the BPD for everything.<br />For an M.D. in the field of psychiatry as the author, he flunked badly. The only way that he can do a \\"make-up exam\\" is by doing an intense self examination - what was going on with me inside for my life to become so out of control during that time period; why would I give up control of my life to another human being; what is it about me that needs to feel I can control another human being; etc? This is where healing comes from for BPD families, not from this author's perspective.<br />It is important to remember that we attract those who are functioning on the same level emotionally. If we find ourselves with a mate who has a mental health disorder, chances are we are not well either. What is important is not to focus on your partner to move ahead, but to focus on yourself asking yourself what is it about you that is not well and what will it take to become a happy and healthy person?<br />Families of the BPD many times make the mistake that this author has and that is to continue to focus on the borderline to improve one's life as if happiness is all up to the borderline and the partner is \\"fine.\\" Untrue.	2004-01-19

Initially, he presents a very important  problem in treating BPDs. One that I have always felt. When discussing long  term therapy, he states \\"..I suspect that only a tiny percent of  borderline patients can afford such treatment.\\" Also discussed are the  limitations that some HMOs have that prevent treating the BPD. He also  states \\"Borderline patients are often so dysfunctional that they do  not have the ability to earn a good income and/or they experience  significant occupational instability...The bottom line is this: These  people who suffer so much cannot afford long term treatment...\\" He  discusses BPD symptomology, therapeutic strategies and even discusses how  the limbic system in the brain is damaged and how medication can help. I  recommend this book to clinicians, borderlines and families.	2000-08-16

The  author has some really good material in the book about DBT and how it has  assisted her in her own recovery. I believe sharing her experiences as an  in-patient at Highland Hospital are particularly important. However, the  book focuses on only one aspect of recovery as if DBT is the *only* avenue  there is to recovery from the BPD. Medication is not discussed which is  extremely vital especially with what the research is saying about how  helpful medications are in providing assistance with many of the BPD  symptoms. The only thing I disagreed in the book was her statement  \\"While disability is a godsend for many former patients who do not  have sufficient financial resources, the public needs to be made aware that  such a resource is an enabler rather than a tag of inability.\\" I have  read that as many as 33 % of BPDs are disabled, not because they want to be  enabled, but because their illness has truly prevented them from sustaining  a job. Would I recommend you buy the book? Yes, there is some good material  there there that is important for BPD recovery.	2000-08-15

With Zig Ziglar, you can't go wrong. These tapes are not only highly motivational for success, but they affirm who you are. I recommend these tapes to anyone who does not  love themselves, are caught up in a cycle of negative thinking and really  anyone who is recovering in some way. Zig's messages are very powerful and  he is very interesting to listen to. He will tell you interesting stories  that you will benefit from and he will assist you in getting past many  obstacles in your life. In fact, I recommend you listen to him everyday. If  you do that, you can't help but notice a change in your life - a change in  the way you view yourself and the world around you.	2000-07-23

I also suffer from both disorders. I just finished reading Jamison's very moving autobiography about living with bipolar  disorder. I could not only relate to much of it; but it provided much  comfort to me reading about someone who has endured the &quot;depths of  hell&quot; as I have. I believe her book is a huge step forward for this  painful and deadly disorder. The more people that come forward about their  illnesses, the more society will stop stigmatizing people and understand  the illness for what it is - a medical, genetic disorder. We didn't ask for  it. We don't deserve it. Kay discusses the risk she took in making her  disorder public as this is still a pioneering time in public opinion and  understanding about mental illness. I admire her for coming forward and I  feel that this book will help many people. It is always a relief realizing  that I am not alone with my own mental illnesses. I really don't think  anyone could possibly understand just what it feels like to have this  disorder, except another person with the same disorder. We are all  different, yet we are the same. I recommend this book not only to bipolars,  but to families, clinicians and anyone who is curious about the BP. Also, I  would feel much more comfortable being seen by a psychiatrist who has the  BP than one that doesn't, wouldn't you? Excellent book. Good job Kay.	2000-06-17

This book, as far as I know is the first book about the BPD written for the consumer. The book in and of itself is excellent and filled with good information. However, many borderlines have felt suicidal after reading this book if this is the first book they read about the BPD. Why? Simply because this book was written awhile back before much was known about how certain medications can be extremely helpful with many of the BPD symptoms such as rage, depression, mood swings, etc. Therefore the book was written with good information but the aspect of hope and recovery is not in this book. One feels hopeless after reading this book. This was the first book I read about the BPD and that is how I felt - more disturbed and hopeless. This is not the author's fault however. He simply wrote the book at a time where there wasn't much known about treatment. It would be great to have this great information along with the new drug treatment in a new edition.	2000-06-17

This brings this disorder more into the public eye and people are beginning to hear about this disorder for the first time, wondering what it is. It has brought this disorder to the attention of the media, at least for a short time. I was hoping that with this increased public awareness, that more funding would become available for research and treatment.<br />The Bad News:<br />The book was written in such a way as if one were reading a tabloid with a lot of idle gossip. So and so said this and that, and much of what is discussed is from what someone or what some newspaper said. It is not based on what either Di or Princess Charles themselves stated.<br />The book was difficult for me to get through perhaps because I don't have a personal interest in the Royal family as well as feeling I was spying in on people's intimate lives that was none of my business.<br />The author is not a mental health professional and much of what she stated about the borderline personality disorder was inaccurate, not giving the public an accurate picture of what the BPD is, or the etiology.<br />Discussion:<br />Many people interviewed in the book as well as the author had their own ideas as to why Diana suffered from the BPD, all ignoring what present research is saying - that it is has biological roots. It is true in the research that there is a high degree of trauma in childhood yet this alone is not the cause. To bring this point home, why didn't all Di's siblings show signs of the BPD?<br />The author states \\"The most important factor setting the borderline personality apart from those with other disorders is early parental loss...\\" This is clearly an incorrect statement and misleading to the readers. There is a connection with early parental loss and the bipolar disorder. <br />If the book is correct about Diana's behavior and moods, it does appear consistent with the borderline personality disorder. I felt all through the book that Diana was judged not only by many people in her life due to this disorder but by the author as well. The BPD is a medical disorder with the limbic system in the brain affected. Eating disorders such as bulimia are very common with the borderline personality disorder. It is in fact uncommon to find someone having the BPD without exhibiting other diagnoses.<br />There is tremendous stigma attached to the borderline personality disorder all over the world, which shows how misunderstood this illness is. Would people with diabetes or cancer be faced with such stigma? Of course not. In fact it was this stigma that kept Diana from getting the proper help she needed, especially with reporters breathing down her back. <br />People with BPD function best when they are in a structured environment with minimum stress. For most all of us to marry into the royal family and live such a stressful and highly visible lifestyle if we were not accustomed to it, would be extremely difficult and stressful. Many other wives such as Fergie for instance who did not have the BPD had difficulty in this environment.<br />Yet, Diana was thrown into this \\"den of wolves\\" and received no support. Though she was at Buckingham Palace amongst many people, she was alone. Her husband Charles in my opinion lacks the ability to be fully intimate and perhaps has commitment issues of his own. The expression of feelings was not encouraged in his upbringing. <br />I believe the royal family to be quite a dysfunctional environment, perhaps more dysfunctional from the Spencer family Di was raised. In spite of Diana's illness the public loved her for her ability to be real and her expression of feelings which the Royal family lacked. <br />The author appears to blame Diana for the renewed relationship between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, I was offended by this as clearly there were many signs that Prince Charlesnever resolved his feelings for Camilla and that Di had reason to question their relationship. I believe Diana's BPD could have exacerbated her obsessions with Camilla, however in my opinion most women would have felt insecure in the same environment.<br />The book also discusses Diana undergoing psychotherapy on many occasions, yet it is known now that psychotherapy can be quite harmful for borderlines. It can make them worse. It is not a recommended form of treatment. Research is now saying that therapy that involves staying in the present. Dialectical Behavior Therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy is recommended.<br />It is sad that Diana was afraid of medications. If she could have taken the correct medication for the BPD (more research is available now), many of her behavioral symptoms could have improved greatly and the real Diana behind her illness could have shown through.<br />The author states \\"...borderlines usually don't take medications as prescribed, at least in part because they view pharmacotherapy - as Diana did-as \\"mind control.\\" This is clearly incorrect and I have seen no evidence of this in borderlines OR the research!<br />Diana was not her illness. She did not ask for it, did not cause it, nor did she deserve it. With the severity of her illness, the many responsibilities she had and being so visible to the public eye, she lived a graceful life that I believe is an example to us all.<br />I do agree with the author when she says \\"Under the right circumstances, Diana could have been helped. She needed to be in a structured and predictable environment, out of the limelight, away from the media's deifying praise and flashes of criticism. She probably could have benefited from practical therapy that avoided delving too deeply into analyzing the past and instead concentrated on managing her symptoms...\\"<br />I believe that no one with the borderline personality disorder has to suffer as Diana has, given the right medication and the right form oftherapy.	1999-10-01
