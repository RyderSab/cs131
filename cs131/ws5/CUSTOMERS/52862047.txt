Most people probably associate \\"The Canterbury Tales\\" with stuffy hoary old English professors and musty craggy libraries. It doesn't help that many english classes assign the Middle English text to students. Though the original language of the Tales doesn't present insurmountable difficulties for the modern English reader, many may find the task daunting nonetheless and completely miss out on all of the good stuff. This edition presents the tales in modern verse (while still maintaining the rhyming couplet form of the original). Numerous footnotes also illuminate the vocabulary of Chaucer's time (he worked on the tales from around 1387 up to his death in 1400).<br /><br />The tales trace the path of a group of pilgrims from the \\"The Tabard\\" Inn in Southwark, England to just outside the town of Canterbury. A host of interesting 14th century characters all agree to ride to the shrine of the martyr together. The host of the Inn decides to join them and makes things interesting with a contest: the person that tells the best tale along the way gets a free supper upon their return. The rest of the book then consists of twenty-four tales (Chaucer had planned over two hundred, but never finished the project) each told by a specific person linked by comments of the company. Thanks to his position as a foreign diplomat, Chaucer probably found inspiration from Bocaccio's \\"Decameron\\" (written around 1350) in the structure of this work.<br /><br />In the tales themselves, the culture of 14th century England comes alive. Not only that, great stories unfold. The Knight's tale, one of the longest, explores painful medieval love. Two brothers, Arcite and Palamon, in ancient Greece spot a beautiful woman, Emily, from their jail cell. They both declare their undying love for her, and vouch their lives to winning her hand. And since both men want her the two of course turn from loyal brothers into mortal enemies. With some strange luck and the help of the gods, one of them eventually triumphs.<br /><br />Some of the pilgrims don't get along too well. The Miller and the Reeve almost attack each other after hurling insults back and forth. The Miller tells a hilarious tale about Nicholas the Gallant who wants to sleep with an old carpeter's young gorgeous wife. He convinces the old man that another flood (akin to Noah's) is pending, and that he should sleep in a bathtub on top of his house. The old man buys the story, and Nicholas sets to his task. Another wooer of the young woman disrupts the couple, and ends up a victim of flatulence (but the giver of the stink ends up even worse). Since the carpenter was depicted as a fool in the tale, and the Reeve is a carpenter, he counter attacks with a tale about a stupid miller.<br /><br />The tales weave incredibly diverse stories. Some end in tragedy (e.g., the Physician's Tale in which a noble Knight must choose between turning his beautiful virtuous daughter over to a corrupt and lecherous judge or killing her out of respect for her honor), some in comedy. Others relate miracles or demonstrate a simple moral point. Yet others show the prejudices of the time, (the Prioress' Tale contains some nasty anti-semitism) or the fashions of the time (the Canon's Yeoman's Tale declares alchemy a fraud). At least one has a surprising feminist bent (The Wife of Bath's Tale, although 14th century values ultimately win out). Some of the more comical characters are the wards of the 14th century Church: the Pardoner, the Summoner, the Friar, and the Monk. All of them get depicted as hopelessly corrupt and hypocritical (in that they don't practice what they preach while having scruples about profiting from their church offices; corruption in the church was a fiery issue of the day).<br /><br />Two of the original prose tales, Chaucer's tale of Melibee and the Parson's tale, only appear in summary here. Chaucer's first tale gets rudely interrupted by the host who complains that \\"Your dreary rhyming isn't worth a turd!\\" Whether the character called \\"Chaucer\\" (the narrator in many sections) actually represented Chaucer himself remains controversial. The Parson's tale, the last in this book, reflects on the Seven Deadly Sins. Chaucer's \\"Retraction\\" appears directly afterwards. In this he excuses himself for any sin he may have committed in this book. So are the Canturbury tales supposed to be meditations on the sinful and sinless life? Since Chaucer didn't complete the project such questions remain somewhat speculatory (also, Chaucer didn't actually write most of the tales himself - this is a collection of tales mosty from other sources in the manner popular at the time - but he did rewrite them with his own vision in mind). What the Canterbury Tales ended up as, nonetheless, is a collection of romantic, baudy, raucous, tragic, and vastly entertaining stories that gorgeously reflect and effectively evoke Chaucer's times. This, maybe more than anything, helps explain why the book has seen continual publication since the fifteenth century.a turd!\\" Whether the character called \\"Chaucer\\" (the narrator in many sections) actually represented Chaucer himself remains controversial.

Anger. People who get angry do nasty things. They swear, throw things, shake their fists at the sky, and kick things that don't necessarily deserve a kick. Or worse. Maybe they launch a thousand ships. Maybe they invade a country. In any case a lot of nasty things have anger as their foundation. So how do we deal with it? This book offers some suggestions.<br /><br />This little book begins by delineating two grand traditions of anger. One, dominant in the West, accepts anger as an inevitable and necessary evil in the course of existence. By this view, anger becomes as unstoppable as the wind. It just plain exists. So we had best accept it. The other tradition, dominant in the East, seeks to annihilate anger altogether. Or, at least, rechannel the energy anger generates into more positive channels. The author finds these two views too polarizing and seeks a middle path by denying neither position but combining somewhat diluted versions of both into one distinct stance. This amounts to, in short, the view that we can't obliterate anger from the earth, but we don't have to let it control us, either. Given the author's background, it shouldn't astonish readers to find that he utilizes Buddhist psychology to attain his goals.<br /><br />Prior to that, however, he takes a small dip into current politics. Chapter One, \\"The Momentous Present\\", defines \\"war\\" as \\"organized anger\\". Then he lets it all hang out, as they say. These 3 pages leave nothing to the imagination concerning Thurman's political views. Essentially, he thinks that the current world bristles with anger, and an analyzis of anger and how to ameliorate or rechannel its energies must occur sooner than later to avoid catastrophe. Then he gets to it (current politics never comes up again, which feels a bit strange considering the obvious passion of this short chapter).<br /><br />Next, a comparison of anger and violence in the East and West concludes that the East shows a \\"real, progressive demilitarization of societies that were once just as violent as the Europeans or Americans, and of the attainment of relatively higher levels of peacefulness.\\" The book follows this line to the end. But first Thurman engages in a little sideroad concerning opinions of anger in Western history.<br /><br />The fascinating chapter four discusses the views on anger of Jesus (who sounds like a Buddhist on the subject of anger), Seneca (who writes about anger as if it were a pestilence and destroyer of societies), Plutarch, St. Augustine, and Chaucer.<br /><br />Following this chapter the book shifts drastically over to the Buddhist perspective and doesn't stray from it. The rest of the book discusses the rechanneling of anger and some of the foundations of Buddhist psychology. The Western perspectives in the first few chapters get almost completely marginalized (a feature that distinguishes this book from the other current books in this \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" series).<br /><br />Starting inexorably down this path, Thurman first subsumes anger as an emotional addiction. The initial step involves seeing anger as a bad thing that comes from within oneself. This provides an insightful key to overcoming the affects of anger on oneself and others. Next, one must use suffering to transcend pain and anger (in the process of explaining this Thurman misquotes Nietzsche as saying \\"What doesn't kill me makes me stronger\\"; this is a common misquote; Nietzsche was himself quoting an old German proverb to make a point; he didn't coin the phrase). Thurman then begins a deep nosedive into Buddhist philosophy. The concepts thicken incredibly at this point. He discusses the various sources of misunderstaning of physical pain that can lead to anger, quoting Shantideva: \\"Even if beings are gentle-natured / And the evil of harm is occassional / It is still wrong to be angry; / Like resenting space for filling with smoke.\\" This involves perspective, and perspective can help distinguish anger's fire. He also speaks about the importance of seeing one's influence beyond the scope of one's life. This helps to wash away thoughts such as \\"my anger won't matter in a hundred years, so why not quench it?\\" The discussion gradually becomes a little too deep for a text of this size (125 pages). And quotes from Shantideva begin to dominate the author's text and ultimately detract somewhat from the end of the discussion.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Thurman does make some good points about anger by using Buddhist psychology, and some very good advice lurks in the book's final five chapters. But the last part of the book never resolves with the first part of the book. A feeling of incompleteness hangs over the final chapter. Not only that, the book slowly morphs from a book mostly about anger into a book mostly about Buddhism (which accounts somewhat for the unresolved feeling of the final chapter).<br /><br />This book also keeps with the practice of some of the other books in this series of including pictures that don't tie to the text. The pictures are great, but how do they relate to the text? They don't seem to at all. So why include them?<br /><br />In the end, this book presents some useful viewpoints on its subject matter. But it's almost exclusively slanted towards the Buddhist answer to the problem of anger. Obviously, the size limitations of the series limited the discussion to one viewpoint. And that viewpoint receives a thorough (almost too thorough) treatment. Consequently, this book probably represents the most difficult read so far in the \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" series (especially for those with no knowledge of Buddhism). Still, along the way readers can learn a lot about Buddhism and about the \\"deadly sin\\" of anger.yond the scope of one's life.

All of the comics, and some parts of popular culture in general, continue on in the shadow of \\"Peanuts\\". True, the strip's popularity declined in the late 1990s. And some found it \\"too commercial\\". Not only that, the comic strip itself has seen a depressing decline (the fate of the traditional comic strip gets tied to the fate of newspapers in general; the two seem inseparable; today's internet comics have a different sort of life). Still, Charlie Brown and Snoopy, in some ways, have become as ingrained in popular culture as Charlie Chaplin or John Wayne. And nothing has come close to filling the void that \\"Peanuts\\" left behind in the year 2000. After all, \\"Peanuts\\" was to the comic strip page what the Beatles were to popular music. Both heightened and expanded their genres irreversibly and with undisputed universal influence.<br /><br />Though \\"Peanuts\\" remains somewhat ubiquitous, its creator, Charles Schulz, remains downright enigmatic. He never openly courted fame, and he poo-pooed notions that his comic strip represented any sort of an \\"art form\\". The interviews collected in this book help bring Schulz to life. They lift that strange veil that surrounds his character. But even after reading this entire book, Schulz retains a good deal of his strange elusiveness. And that might have just as much to do with the readers than with the creator of \\"Peanuts\\".<br /><br />We've come to expect celebrities to act a certain way, to be a certain way, and to flaunt themselves in a certain way. Schulz contradicted most of our assumptions about what a celebrity represents and stands for. With all of his lavish success and international honors he continually downplayed his achievements by saying that he \\"only draws a comic strip\\". He seemed confused, but gracious, by the fuss that people made over \\"Peanuts\\". When asked about his creative process by multiple interviewers in this book, his collective responses pretty much sum up to \\"it's a job\\". He claimed he didn't know where his ideas came from. And his focus remained on drawing 365 strips a year, and that remained the main focus of his life. The Schulz that ultimately emerges from these interviews seems self-deprecating and a little bitter, but nonetheless cautiously proud of his stature in the comic strip realm (though always adding \\"it's only a comic\\").<br /><br />On the flip side from Schulz's Midwestern \\"boy next door\\" demeanor stands his fairly lavish lifestyle. The soft spoken, modest Schulz lived in almost palatial estates packed with the luxuries of the day. Kenneth Wilson's interview from 1967 begins with his becoming almost hopelessly lost in the vastness of the \\"Coffee Grounds\\" in Northern San Fransisco (where Schulz lived with his first wife until around 1972). Schulz later admitted that the Redwood Empire Ice Arena had cost him $140,000 a month to maintain. He also had his own private golf course. So there's a tension between the soft-spoken comic strip man and the man possessing a fabulous, unimaginable fortune.<br /><br />So something's happening here. And this something makes these interviews scintillating to pressure point. Schulz also claimed that he was not an intellectual; that he didn't understand deep appreciations of his work (such as Umberto Eco's rhapsody on the psychological wonders of \\"Peanuts\\"). Nonetheless, he enjoyed Fellini movies, great novels (Tolstoy), \\"Citizen Kane\\", Classical Music (particularly Brahms), and George Herriman's \\"Krazy Kat\\" (a wildly intellectual comic strip; the only one that usually beats out \\"Peanuts\\" on \\"best strip\\" polls). He was also deeply religious, had taught Sunday School to adults, didn't believe that Christianity should have denominations, and had a well thought out argument against prayer in public schools. So his innocent child-like persona either belied self-knowledge on his own part or was a facade put on for the public. Thomas Hart Benton, the famous American painter, was deeply intellectual and well-read but was terrified of letting his fans know this. He thought it would negatively affect the public portrayal of his paintings. For similar reasons Ben Franklin wore a fur cap to Versailles. Was Schulz up to the same thing? He comes across as a pretty smart and worldly guy throughout these interviews. But he also continually made statements such as \\"I don't get that\\" or \\"that's above me\\". Maybe he thought cartoonists shouldn't display intellectual capacities publicly? Or perhaps simple modesty motivated him? Of course it's all speculation to a degree, but this tension runs throughout the interviews. Particularly following his astonishing remark from 1956: \\"I guess I'm the worst sort of egotist-the kind who pretends to be humble.\\" One thing remains clear at the end of this book: there's much more to Charles Schulz than meets the eye.<br /><br />One of the most interesting (and maybe revealing) passages in the book comes in the book's final interview. Gary Groth, from \\"Comics Journal\\", outright asked why Schulz takes part in such commercial ventures as the Metropolitan Life ads. Schulz dodged the question somewhat, but Groth didn't swerve. He claimed that Schulz has enough money to keep going without the licensing of his characters. Schulz replied, \\"Yeah, but I couldn't do all of the things that we do... If you turn that off, I'll recount some of that.\\" And Groth inserted: \\"[The tape recorder is turned off and Schulz recounts some of his philanthropic work.]\\" Again, more evidence that things just aren't as they seem.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the creator of \\"Peanuts\\" should read this book. It runs the gamut of his career from 1956 to 1997. The book's final interview runs nearly 100 pages all by itself. It covers voluminous topics. Also, \\"Peanuts\\" strips from all eras dot the pages, including some of Schulz's lesser known Saturday Evening Post comics and his first ever published drawing (of his dog from a \\"Ripley's Believe it or Not\\" strip from the 1930s).<br /><br />Schulz's \\"Peanuts\\" stands as the pinnacle and, sadly, probably as the swan song of a printed medium in fast decline. It's difficult to imagine that a comic strip will ever again capture the public's imagination the way \\"Peanuts\\" did in the 20th century.

If you're a voracious reader of novels or stories, but not an English Literature Major, and often find yourself thinking \\"there's more going on in this story, but I can't figure out what\\" then this book will provide a great starting point for expanding your reading. Foster takes the uninitiated on an easy to follow quest through literary symbology, allusion, and theory. It focuses almost exclusively on reading, not on writing (though one can vastly improve one's writing by becoming a better reader). And the intended audience is the beginner (though someone who has never read a novel might not fare too well).<br /><br />Foster's ideas may strike some as \\"out there\\". He reads stories and symbols on a very mythological level. And this leads to his easy to misunderstand notion of \\"there's only one story\\". By this he doesn't mean \\"there's only one plot\\" or \\"all stories are the same story\\" but something more philosophical such as \\"all stories belong to and feed off of the one big story\\" (something ineffably akin to existence and history). Thus stories and symbols take on recognizable meanings over time. They get embedded in culture and interact with other stories. The best examples he discusses involve the Bible (\\"Christ figures\\", floods, etc), Shakespeare, Fairy Tales, and Greek Mythology. Stories have the ability to tap into these culturally embedded notions and heighten the meaning of a plot or a character. This only works because \\"we're all part of the same story\\" and, subsequently, because \\"there's only one story\\". Originality, then, becomes a measure of how well a story taps into this wellspring of meaning and exploits it for purposes of its own meaning.<br /><br />Foster presents this idea of one story as the source of literary allusion. He gives numerous examples to support this theory with various symbols, including: quests, vampirism, eating, rain and snow, violence, flight, disease, the seasons, and geography. His approach isn't a tyrannical one, either. He doesn't, for instance, say \\"rain is ALWAYS cleansing!!\\" Foster accepts the notion that symbols only suggest meaning, they don't dictate it. Symbols have fluidity. Different people may interpret \\"snow\\" in different ways (though bad interpretations do exist, as Foster also recognizes). And irony also throws a wrench into the narrative machine.<br /><br />Other topics that receive mention include politics and sex. Foster points out that many covert political stories exist (in defiance of the \\"don't put politics into your fiction!\\" dictum). He uses Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\" to eludcidate this. As for sex, Foster finds symbolic literary sex far more satsifying than outright portrayals of intimacy in stories. Why? Because sexual intimacy typically carries symbolic meaning for a story. It carries the plot forward.<br /><br />Foster's book most of all encourages the questioning of a story. Why is the main character short or tall? Why is the story set in winter rather than spring or summer? Why do references to birds keep appearing in a story? Such questions lead a reader down the path of reading a story in a more broad way. Which should heighten the experience of reading.<br /><br />The book's final chapter presents a \\"test case\\" in the form of Katherine Mansfield's short story \\"The Garden Party\\". After reading the story (included as a whole), Foster asks the reader to consider some questions and return to the text. He then gives interpretations of some of his students and finally his own reading of the story. For those that have never taken a literature course, this chapter probably provides the most benefit, especially regarding the \\"tools\\" introduced in the preceding chapters. Here he puts theory to practice.<br /><br />In the end, Foster claims that this book doesn't represent the only, or even necessarily the best, way to read and analyze a story. So those who already have a literary background may take issue with his approach. But for the beginner this book presents apossible new dimension for reading, understanding, and judging stories. It should help to dispell the notion that literary teachers and professors just \\"make it all up.\\" Most of all, it should provide a good launching pad, not a landing pad, for further reading.ng, and judging stories.

US	52862047	RBLRHUZGUTOX0	0810981521	245193225	Krazy Kat: The Comic Art of George Herriman	Books	5	41	42	N	N	Interested in Krazy Kat? Start here...	This book stands as the best introduction to one of the best comic strips ever produced. Not only is it packed with hard to find \\"Krazy Kat\\" strips, but it also includes a biography of the artist, George Herriman. Some consider Herriman the first African-American mainstream cartoonist. His colleagues didn't know his ethnicity (and Herriman didn't tell them) so some called him \\"the Greek\\". He felt he had to hide some of his features from the public. For example, he kept his very curly hair closely cut and hidden under a hat. Not only that, his birth certificate shows his parent's ethnicity as \\"colored\\". The prejudices of the time likely would not have allowed an African-American the mainstream status and freedom allowed to George Herriman. So through \\"Krazy Kat\\" we get a glimpse of what early 20th century American culture may have missed out on due to its racial myopia. For \\"Krazy Kat\\" stands as an absolute masterpiece of its genre.<br /><br />Herriman found some modicum of fame in his lifetime. William Randolph Hearst (the newspaper magnate) loved Herriman's work and rewarded him with a lifetime contract (according to the biography in the book, Hearst once read a \\"Krazy Kat\\" Sunday page and immediately demanded a raise for the artist). Herriman's success didn't come quickly, however. His first big break came in 1897 with the sale of a sketch to the Los Angeles Herald. Around 1901 he landed his first job as a \\"Staff Cartoonist\\" (a person who literally reported to the office every day and rattled off strip after strip; very different from today's cartoonists). Between 1901 and 1916 Herriman penned numerous strips (the book includes samples of many of these strips - many in color), including: \\"Musical Mose\\" (this strip's overt racial humor would not fly today), \\"Professor Otto and His Auto\\", \\"Acrobatic Archie\\", \\"Two Jolly Jackies\\", \\"Major Ozone's Fresh Air Crusade\\", \\"Home Sweet Home\\", \\"Baron Mooch\\", \\"Mary's Home From College\\", \\"Gooseberry Sprig\\" (considered to be a direct forerunner to \\"Krazy Kat\\"), \\"Alexander the Cat\\", \\"Daniel and Pansy\\", and finally, in 1910, \\"The Dingbat Family\\" (which changed its name briefly to \\"The Family Upstairs\\"; it was Herriman's first hit). It was in a \\"Dingbat Family\\" strip in 1910 that a mouse first \\"beaned\\" a \\"Kat\\" with a projectile (in the \\"running boards\\" of the strip). Eventually the Kat and mouse sideshow surpassed the main strip's popularity, and \\"Krazy Kat\\" debuted as a daily in October 1913 (the famous Sunday pages began in 1916). Herriman kept experimenting with other strips through 1923 when he finally placed his focus squarely on \\"Krazy Kat\\".<br /><br />From roughly 1913 to 1944 (when Herriman passed away leaving a week's worth of unfinished Krazy Kat's on his drawing table) \\"Krazy Kat\\" developed from a \\"Kat\\" and mouse game (filled with puns, misunderstandings, and musings on the imperfections of language) into a complex love triangle between Krazy (the \\"Kat\\"), Ignatz (the mouse) and Offisa Pupp (the dog). Ignatz's entire being revolves around \\"beaning\\" the \\"Kat\\" with a brick, and Krazy interprets this as an act of love (unbeknownst to Ignatz). Offisa Pupp loves Krazy (in a fatherly sort of way) and his obsession revolves around catching Ignatz in the act and jailing him. Three obsessions collide in an almost jazz-style derivation of themes. Herriman developed this theme brilliantly over 30 years of strips. But overall it defies analysis: the strip can only speak for itself.<br /><br />Sadly, though \\"Krazy Kat\\" counted such dignatiries as e.e. cummings, George Gershwin, Gilbert Seldes, James Joyce, and other literati, as fans, its popularity waned dramatically throughout the 1930s (as it became more surreal, esoteric and unabashedly uncommercial). It was kept in print by Hearst himself. The book does not cover the frustration of Hearst editors at the inclusion of the strip in their papers. They rebelled against it in some cases. Many simply tried to remove it from circulation only to findHearst himself yelling \\"keep it in!\\" So we have, of all people, the controversial William Randolph Hearst to thank for the continuation of \\"Krazy Kat\\". By the end of its run \\"Krazy Kat\\" only appeared in some 30 papers.<br /><br />The main focus of this book lies in its numerous incredible strips. The book includes daily strips (most dating from 1938 to 1944) and Sunday pages (dating from 1916 to 1944 with some in color; it also includes both the first and last Sunday pages). If one reason exists to purchase this book, here it is. The strips retain their amazing character even after decades of aging. And the artwork remains astounding. Not only that, the book includes samples of hand colored drawings of Herriman's, and photos of Herriman and his family. All in all, this book opens the door on one of the comic strip medium's most celebrated strips. Those that get hooked should continue thier obsessions (in the true spirit of Krazy, Ignatz, and Offisa Pupp) with the Fantagraphics' series of Sunday pages, and the Pacific Comics club's reprints of daily strips. Someday every Krazy Kat strip Herriman drew will finally appear in printed form.

All in all, this book opens the door on one of the comic strip medium's most celebrated strips. Those that get hooked should continue thier obsessions (in the true spirit of Krazy, Ignatz, and Offisa Pupp) with the Fantagraphics' series of Sunday pages, and the Pacific Comics club's reprints of daily strips. Someday every Krazy Kat strip Herriman drew will finally appear in printed form. We can hope, at least.	2005-08-14

The media, always groping for sound bites to make generalizations more palatable, grabbed the title of Coupland's first novel and ran with it like an Olympic torch. Henceforth, anyone born between the late 1950s and the early 1970s were dubbed \\"Generation Xers\\". Obviously this media hype boosted the novel's visibility to heights it may otherwise not have reached (the book had difficulty finding a publisher in Coupland's home country of Canada). It also created a rather false generalization of its own. One based on a misunderstanding of a literary device. Fiction may have created fiction in this case.<br /><br />Coupland claims that he never intended to speak for his own, or any, generation in this book. He took the \\"X\\" in the title from Paul Fussell's hilarious and intentionally inflammatory book \\"Class\\". In its final chapter, called \\"The X Way Out\\", Fussell discusses people who attempt to evade the rigid American class system. These people attempt to work outside this system and avoid, in Fussell's words, \\"...some of the envy and ambition that pervert so many.\\" Arguably, Coupland's \\"Generation X\\" presents portraits of three \\"X people\\": Andy, Dag, and Claire (Coupland uses this phrase only twice in the book in tandem with the Japanese phrase \\"shin jin rui\\" or \\"X generation\\" which represents a generation \\"purposefully hiding itself\\"). They have escaped (though not completely) by moving to Palm Springs and working less ambitious jobs than their school mates. They also share stories with one another on a regular basis. Why they do this gets printed explicitly in the following passage from the book's first chapter: \\"Either our lives become stories, or there's just no way to get through them.\\" Throughout the book Coupland contrasts these \\"X\\" characters with those still struggling with \\"the system\\" (such as Claire's obsession Tobias, Elvissa's friend Curtis, and Andy's brother). Plot isn't really the point here. The novel represents more of a character study of the \\"X people\\" more than any exercise in roller coaster narrative adventurousness. The book's major highlights come from the stories told by the characters. The book's ending packs some emotional surprises. Did Andy finally find, out on that field, a meaningful moment in and of itself? Do Claire and Dag (and soon Andy) really escape \\"the system\\"? And does it matter? The book does raise some good questions. And overall it's an entertaining read.<br /><br />The book also experiments with the presentation of the traditional novel. Definitions or neologisms line the margins of the novel like medieval gloss. Term such as \\"McJob\\", \\"Veal Fattening Pen\\", \\"Conspicuous Minimalism\\", \\"Bread and Circuits\\", and \\"101-ism\\" dot the story and give a text-book or anthropological feeling to the text. Apparently the book intends to instruct as well as entertain. Cartoons (some looking like a hybrid of \\"Mary Worth\\" and Roy Lichtenstein) and diagrams add spice to the look of the book, as well as provide a pictoral context for some of the chapters and stories. The overarching picture gets painted not only with text but with pictures and definitions. Though this approach is refreshing, it can also be distracting at times. But overall it adds to the fun of the book.<br /><br />The one place Coupland may have gone too far was with the statistics at the end. They shove the message down the reader's throat a little too strongly. Especially following the moving ending of \\"the story\\" that precedes them. Placing these figures in the margins throughout the text (or in the white spaces at the end of chapters) would have probably lent more subtlety to the numbers (though \\"subtle\\" doesn't describe this book at all).<br /><br />\\"Generation X\\" had an impact (regardless of its literary status, which remains controversial). It represents a great first novel, and it's very fun to read. Some may find it cynical, or loaded with youthful idealism or unproductive dropout-ism. And maybe they're right. Or not. Either way,the reader has to ultimately decide on the value of the content and message of the text. But in the end, the book \\"Generation X\\" represents more than a mere media catch-phrase.cide on the value of the content and message of the text.

It's simply unbelievable to think that the years 1973 and 1974, years after the progress of the civil rights movement, saw Hank Aaron come under fire of severe racial hatred and prejudice. His crime? He went after the \\"sacred\\" all-time home run record of Babe Ruth. Death threats, tinged with racial slurs, to himself and his family followed him as he slowly approached home run number 715. Some ugly undercurrents of American society simultaneously emerged.<br /><br />This book recounts Aaron's journey from an underrated baseball star of the 1950s and 1960s to an undisputed baseball legend. It even harkens back to Babe Ruth's days of fast and reckless living as he slammed 714 home runs throughout the 1920s and 1930s. This record was thought by many to be completely untouchable (and termed \\"The Mountain\\"). So who was this Henry \\"Hank\\" Aaron, a not so celebrated but extremely well-rounded player, from the Braves to suddenly come out of almost nowhere to challenge the sport's demi-god? People finally began to notice as Aaron snuck up on the all-time record. By the time he reached number 700 a country-wide media craze exploded. Aaron found himself caught in the middle complete with body guards, a private secretary, appearances on television shows, magazines, hordes of fan mail, and, most significantly, horrific hate mail. Even Babe Ruth's widow didn't seem too enthusiastic about Aaron's increasing home run numbers. Even more unbeliveable, the baseball commissioner at the time, Bowie Kuhn, didn't personally congratulate Aaron on #700. And on top of that, the book even records that, as Aaron went for the big record, Atlanta fans showed up in increasingly smaller numbers to home games. But eventually they redeemed themselves. And we all know how the story ends, but this book provides many details for those of us who weren't, or couldn't be, there.<br /><br />This book will interest not only baseball fans, but fans of popular culture in general. After all, Aaron's record represents one of the biggest pop culture events of the past 40 years (which has resurfaced with Barry Bonds). The ugly underneath and Aaron's eventual triumph in the face of this adversity will inspire anyone.<br /><br />This book represents one of those great sports books that goes beyond sports to show its impact on society in general. By his perserverance, Hank Aaron opened roads for many people in popular culture. This fact has gone underappreciated for too long. And this book attempts to fill this gap by showcasing the accomplishments of Hank Aaron that will likely outlast even his incredible baseball records.biggest pop culture events of the past 40 years (which has resurfaced with Barry Bonds).

US	52862047	RM3XI944CLMCX	0374105901	710553156	Arnold Schoenberg's Journey	Books	4	18	18	N	N	An attempt at a more "superficial treatment" of Schoenberg...	Schoenberg's music gets treated at times like no more than a necessary intellectual evil: \\"Ok! Ok! Tonal centers aren't the only musical expressive form! We get it! Now can we please get back to beautiful life-affirming melodies and harmonies?!?!\\" The music often gets treated from only a theoretical viewpoint, and many people read about Schoenberg, or worse, read opinions about his music, before really experiencing the music itself. In this sense the music doesn't get a chance to live and breathe on its own without an angorra-thick layer of theory and sometimes obscure and opaque musicology heaped over it. The author of this book states this idea very eloquently in the introduction: \\"...it is not entirely in a spirit of facetiousness that I have said to friends that I feel perhaps Schoenberg's work deserves a more superficial treatment than it has hitherto received.\\" This theme runs throughout the book, and the reader actually has a chance to get to know Schoenberg's biography and how that biography potentially related to his music without being subjected to stifling theory.<br /><br />The book as a whole is made up of short chapters some of which contain mostly biography and others of which contain mostly descriptions and reflections on some of Schoenberg's major works (there are chapters completely dedicated to the following works: Verkl&auml;rte Nacht, Gurre-Lieder, Brettl-Lieder (from Schoenberg's suprising tenure with Berlin cabarets in 1901-1902), Five Pieces For Orchestra, Erwartung, Pierrot Lunaire, Die gl&uuml;ckliche Hand, Moses Und Aron, and the String Trio). This book doesn't just cover his music, though. One chapter gets devoted to his very literary treatise on harmony, \\"Harmonielehre\\". Another chapter discusses Schoenberg's paintings (some of which Gustave Mahler purchased to help support his financially struggling colleague). Two interesting later chapters deal with his propensity to create games and practical inventions, and even a reflection on being short (a trait that the author confesses to share; Schoenberg himself was under 5'4\\" which ranks him heightwise beneath Napolean).<br /><br />Some of the most fascinating biographical episodes involve the audience and critical reactions to Schoenberg's works (at a performance of Pierrot Lunaire an audience member supposedly pointed at Schoenberg and yelled \\"Shoot him! Shoot him!\\" other concerts prompted his friends to shield him from projectiles thrown by the audience, or to evacuate him from the theater, and many performances were literally shouted down - the vocalist at the premiere of his Second String Quartet apparently left the stage in tears). An entire chapter also gets dedicated to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique (often derogatorily subsumed as \\"overly intellectualist\\"); a technique he followed in his later works (most notably in \\"Music for a Film Scene\\", Op. 34, and the famous Piano Concerto, Op. 42).<br /><br />Schoenberg also lived through major world events: World War I (in which he took a part) and World War II (which forced him to flee Germany and Austria in the rising tide of 1930s Anti-Semitism; \\"Ode To Napolean Bonaparte\\", Op. 41, stands as Schoenberg's musical lashing out at Hitler's tyranny). He also tried to help Jews in europe during Hitler's rise; he took anti-semitism as a given (one could arguably make the depressingly bizarre claim that anti-semitism was almost \\"fashionable\\" in the early part of the twentieth-century) and advocated a Jewish homeland.<br /><br />Schoenberg's skills as a teacher (his most reliable source of income throughout his life) receives notice here, too. His pedogogical style apparently didn't encourage devoteeism. Some of his most famous students included Alban Berg, Anton Webern, and John Cage. All followed their own distinct directions following Schoenberg's instruction.<br /><br />This book brings Schoenberg to life for those who know little about him. Those who have not heard any of Schoenberg's music should seek it out before reading this book. After all, the message of this book relates to finding meaning through active listening to, not intellectualizing about, the music of Schoenberg. Some passages might get a little thick for those with no musical background. And some contain actual musical notation. Nonetheless, a music theory background is not required to read or even to enjoy this book (though admittedly it would be helpful).

He first appeared in Detective Comics in May of 1939, and this very year, 2005, saw another major motion picture release featuring Batman (complete with sequel set-up). Apart from movies, Batman has starred in countless comic books and strips, television shows, and numerous toys and other ancillary products. America doesn't seem able to tire of this character approaching the 70-year mark. Why?<br /><br />Some of the answers get revealed in this incredible archival volume containing the first Batman stories ever printed. Running from May 1939 to April 1941, readers can see the entire Batman mythology unfold before their eyes. In the very first issue we find out Batman's true identity (or, more accurately, we find out what Bruce Wayne does after the sun goes down). Not only that, Batman's dual nature lays out before us immediately. He shows no mercy to criminals as he uses the very tools they use to gain their ends: fear and brute force. In essence, Batman fights fire with fire. Running through this story is an unbearable tension: we root for Batman because he stands for justice, but he doesn't necessarily represent the law (once, when the police bust in on him he shouts \\"The Law!\\" as if he himself stood outside of it). He punches cops and security guards. He tresspasses knowingly. in short, Batman represents the \\"just\\" vigilante. Someone who has their own agenda and uses whatever means they can to fulfill it. The main difference between Batman and the criminals is that the results Batman obtains fall on the side of justice. The crooks and criminals often have stealing, kidnapping, and murder on their minds. With an equal passion, and with similar methods, Batman rushes to stop them. To top it all off, Batman does not posess supernatural powers (unlike Superman who debuted a year before in 1938). Any of us mere human mortals, given the resources and strength, could potentially become the Batman. Superman stands far outside of our current human thresholds. But Batman? Batman could live next door.<br /><br />Surely the above accounts for at least some of Batman's seeming immortality. The original comics contained in this book speak volumes about the lure of the character. They have elements of 1930s drama (and sometimes melodrama, but it's the comics, after all), plenty of evil villians (some of which do seem supernatural, or who use technology to obtain their strength; Batman must be equally matched; he wouldn't carry as much fascination if he only went around beating up pick-pockets), strange murders, schemes, and plots. These stories and their corresponding artwork provide pure entertainment, and even some food for thought, even today.<br /><br />Bob Kane's early artwork maintains its mystique. Though technically less proficient than the artwork of Batman's later years, Kane's treatment gives Batman an otherworldly look and feel. The extremely pointy cowel and nose, and the more angular cape make Batman look more sinister and mysterious than in later years. Batman's appearance begins to change in 1940, and then continuously morphs to the Batman look of the 1950s and 1960s. Others still continue to redefine his look, but more recently artists have returned to the early Batman's more sinister look a la Bob Kane (the Batman from the 1960s tv show looked anything but sinister).<br /><br />This volume not only introduces Batman, but Robin, Commissioner Gordon, Clayface, the Monk, the Batmobile (which was originally a red-colored car of the era), the \\"Bat Plane\\" (originally called \\"the Batgyro\\"), the \\"Batarang\\", as well as the terms \\"The Dark Knight\\", and \\"The Dynamic Duo\\". Bruce Wayne's fiancee, a movie actress named Julie, breaks up with him because she wants him to \\"do something with his life\\" (a sacrifice that Bruce Wayne accepts almost to a preistly degree - don't look for too much lovin' or any sexual innuendoes in these comics). The Joker appears but not for the first time. Many milestones of comics history appear in this 300-page book.<br /><br />These comics will be of interest to any Batman fan, or historian of the comics.

This summer, I took a class in which we read this entire book. Yes, all 600+ pages of text (thankfully we weren't tested on the index). This HUGE book presents a very thorough treament of the Systems Development Life Cycle and the profession of Systems Analysis. From Project Planning to System Maintenance, hardly a detail gets shunned.<br /><br />The book overall emphasizes the traditional SDLC, but weaves in some discussion of newer methodologies such as: Extreme Programming, Object Oriented design, CASE tools, and other agile methodologies. And if anyone wants to know what a Systems Analyst does day to day on the job, Appendix 1 spells it out pretty thoroughly. Anyone thinking of becoming a Systems Analyst should at least read this appendix, if not the entire book.<br /><br />The book doesn't emphasize customer service to a great degree. As a working Systems Analyst, I find that customer service skills come in handy every single day. Appendix 1 does mention this skill, but not in an overly detailed manner. Information Systems in general deemphasizes the customer side of things (\\"User error!!!\\" still gets mockingly shouted across many help desks and support centers), which accounts for some of the problems that the industry as a whole faces (sometimes we're a little too easy to outsource). So a little more on the importance of customer service might have improved the book.<br /><br />In the end, this book is a textbook. The going gets rough in many places as details pile upon details. But to understand some of the complexities of system development, a detailed approach probably represents the best way to go. So if you're looking for pleasure reading, look elsewhere. But if you want a detailed, granular, sometimes heady, complex treatment of the analysis side of Systems Development, this book offers more than you'll need for the traditional approach to the SDLC. Those looking for details on XP or OOP should look elsewhere.	2005-07-13

Of course, not just any song, but the \\"how does it feeeeeel?\\" song that refuses to disappear since its release as a two-sided 45 in 1965. Has any other or, maybe a better question would be, can any other song receive the in-depth, subterranean, data mined, ultra-nuanced treatment that Greil Marcus gives to Bob Dylan's \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\"?<br /><br />That the song remains legendary no one probably doubts. That it stands as one of the greatest rock songs ever recorded may also not meet with much dissidence. But over two-hundred pages on a single song? The idea alone entices a read.<br /><br />So what happens in this book? And why should anyone read it? First off, this book likely won't appeal to those who don't see a connection between popular music, popular culture, how it potentially affects our lives as consumers/listeners, and how a song can take on a life of its own (which explains the \\"biography\\" moniker - this book really tries to capture the life the song took on all by itself). Some of the claims this book makes seem a little far out. Did \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" contain seeds for a \\"strange revolution\\"? Does the song have, for lack of a better term, a metaphysical category all of its own (as some of the descriptions and rhapsodies in this book suggest) that seems unreachable and ineffable? Those who like to put on music, dance to it, and not think about it will probably close this book quickly. In other words, it's a heady book for those who want to dig into the mystique of popular music and theorize about what makes it tick. Marcus descends to levels of granularity that don't seem possible when chatting about popular music. Some of the chapters read thickly, and, without a share of Marcus' knowledge, some of the references approach the incomprehensible.<br /><br />Still, this rather short book bloats with interesting historical tidbits about Dylan, the song, the origins of the song, multifarious perspectives on the song, readings of the song's lyrics, the recording of the song, and some of its concert history. Some of these contain new information (songs in which \\"Rolling Stone\\" have appeared, the history of Highway 61 - the actual physical highway, the pop and culture scene of the early 1960s - for those of us who weren't there, at least). Others will seem very familiar to hard core Dylan fans (the 1965 Newport Folk Festival where the crowd booed Dylan, Al Kooper sneaking into the studio, the infamous \\"Judas!\\" remark). The book's epilogue contains almost a play-by-play of the recording session for the song. It reveals glimpses of how it almost got away from the group. But was take 4 an \\"accident\\" as Marcus claims?<br /><br />A few things don't receive mention: Dylan included a strange and sloppy version of \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" on the monolithic and bizarre \\"Self-Portrait\\". What was that all about? And what about Dylan's song \\"Highway 51 Blues\\" from his first album. What highway was that and can any connection be drawn from that song to the 1965 album? Also, Marcus quotes the line \\"Highway 61, go right past my baby's door\\" on page 167. This line appears in the song \\"Highway 51 Blues\\" but as \\"Highway 51, go right past my baby's door.\\" Did he mix the two up or is there some assumed and implied historical knowledge in that passage?<br /><br />It's hard to describe what this book offers. For one, it contains loads of philosophical speculation about the song. It also bequeaths a wealth of information on this single subject. So much so, that upon finishing it, the loads of information mingle in the brain with other facts and snippets of the song (try not singing \\"how does it feeeel\\" continuously). Is the song as significant as Marcus makes it out to be? The answer to and degree of that question depends on the person asking it. In the end, this book is not for everyone. It's a specialist's book. Those who find themselves wondering about how a song goes from studio to legend or how an artist deals or struggles with a song as it takes on legendary water will likely love every page. Those that want to dance or groove should close the book and turn on their stereos. Nonetheless, it may also shine a light on the phenomema of popular music and its mystical and capricious side. There's more to a great song than notes, after all.as it takes on legendary water will likely love every page. Those that want to dance or groove should close the book and turn on their stereos.

Krazy Kat often gets hailed as the best comic strip of all time. The strip never gained huge popularity in its run, and by the 1940s it only ran in a few newspapers. So what accounts for its massive reputation? The best advice one can give is to simply read the strip to find out. It doesn't take too long.<br /><br />Numerous publishing companies have attempted to reprint the strip. Unfortunately, the undertaking seems somewhat cursed (much akin to the \\"Don Quixote\\" legend in the world of film). Eclipse attempted to reprint all of the Krazy Kat Sunday pages. They made it to 1924 and then aborted the series. Some time after Fantagraphics picked up where Eclipse dropped off. Recently, news of financial difficulties within that company have spread. But they haven't closed shop yet (the series currently extends to 1932). Now, a company called \\"Stinging Monkey\\" announces their intent to reprint Krazy Kat dailies. So far they have published this single volume (in large and small formats). As of this writing, the website \\"[...]\\", printed on the book itself, cannot be found. Has the Krazy Kat reprint curse returned? Let's hope not.<br /><br />Stinging Monkey's attempt represents the best attempt so far to reprint the rarely seen Krazy Kat dailies. Pacific Comics Club tried (starting with 1921, and they're up to 1923), but the miniscule size of their books (especially the 1921 issue) makes reading a headache. Though the effort remains appreciated. The initial Stinging Monkey release came out in an incredible large format which made for easy reading and great detailed drawings. Later the small format was released which remained very readable but lost some of the detail of the large format. Get the large format if possible.<br /><br />As for the strips themselves, this book covers the very early years, 1918 - 1919, of Krazy Kat as its own strip. The jokes spew puns, misunderstandings, and bizarreness that speak both of their time and of Herriman's skills as a cartoonist. Think of the Sunday pages presented in brief snippets. Most are gag cartoons. Some contain verbal jokes, while others remain purely visual. The strips really begin to hit their stride towards the end of the book. Here Herriman's surrealism and charming absurdism starts to seep in. All Krazy Kat fans will not want to miss these.<br /><br />Hopefully Stinging Monkey has not gone the way of the Eclipse series. A complete run of Krazy Kat dailies would present a boon to fans and the comic community in general. Seeing that this volume dates to 2003, though, it doesn't look incredibly promising.ented in brief snippets. Most are gag cartoons. Some contain verbal jokes, while others remain purely visual.

Here is perhaps the best book to give to someone who asks \\"what is this philosophy stuff all about anyway?\\" In this short 100-page book the basic problems of philosophy receive coherent, meaningful, and very down to earth treatment. Nearly anyone can read this book. It includes no large imposing technical terms or obscure opaque theories. The language and subject matter of the book take aim at the true beginner and hit every time. Anyone with no background in philosophy, but with a curious streak for the subject, should read this book cover to cover.<br /><br />Another interesting approach this book takes involves the complete absence of the names of eminent philosophers. Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Nietzsche, Russell, Quine; none of their names appear. This focuses the book on the nitty gritty subject matter, not the \\"big names\\" that pack most introductory philosophy texts. It also focuses readers on themselves. The questions asked and subjects covered can be directly related to the reader's own experience and life. One doesn't have to have read Descartes' \\"Meditations on The First Philosophy\\" to follow the first four chapters. They can be read and related to one's own experience, for some very basic questions get unearthed here: How do I know anything? How do I know that other people have minds? Am I a mind and a body or just a body? How do I figure out what words mean? And so on. This makes for a very welcoming introduction for newcomers. The book empowers those with little background rather than batting them down with \\"great names\\" or \\"great theories\\". Hopefully the text will whet the appetite for more (don't stop here by any means).<br /><br />For those with a philosophy background (I have a B.A.) the book can still be refreshing in its simplicity. Reading it feels like going back to the basics or revisiting one's roots. Probably the best reason to read it is to gauge its effectiveness as an introductory text. Then of course recommend it to others.<br /><br />Thomas Nagel (if you're involved in philosophy you've likely heard of him) also adds in some interesting passages. One of the best is: \\"Suppose a scientist were crazy enough to try to observe your experience of tasting chocolate by licking your brain while you ate a chocolate bar.\\" Wow. There's an image and a concept you don't hear about every day.<br /><br />Also, the book actually gives credence to the subjects of death and the meaning of life. Many people think philosophy is about the meaning of life (it is, but in the universities only on an extreme micro scale). Nagel writes eloquently and fairly about both. You may not accept his ideas about these subjects (depending on your background), but they provide fuel for thought and reflection. And one should heed Nagel's statement in the introduction that \\"...if I say what I think, you have no reason to believe it unless you find it convincing.\\" Nagel's observation that we may in fact be in more trouble if there is an afterlife than if there isn't is particularly intriguing.<br /><br />Nagel accomplished something great with this ultra-slim volume.

He made some of the fundamental problems of philosophy accessible to almost anyone. That's no small achievement for a very small book.	2005-05-08

But that doesn't mean it's not a collection of great comics from the middle of last century. Kelly was apparently still developing his characters and his animal-infused \\"town\\" of Okefenokee Swamp in 1949. But the principle characters appear: of course Pogo and Albert, and Howland Owl, Porkypine, and the Rackety Coons. Along with innumerable transient characters such as the short lived Abou Ben Franklin (an electric eel that helps run the radio), Gopher Yerguns the rowdy gopher cowboy and his comedy team of Caterpiggles, the scheming Jacques Frost who impersonates a government agent and convinces Albert and Pogo to paint the tress and themselves, and the annual thanksgiving turkey (in disguise for obvious reasons).<br /><br />Even without the politics, Volume 2 has plenty to offer. It all begins with the hunt for Beauregard. A lady bug hides in Albert's police hat and causes confusion; Albert and the bloodhound trade roles which gives Albert a chance to showcase his dog impersonation skills (\\"Birch! Birch!\\"); Porkypine figures out what a banjo is for after Boll Weevil serenades him; Porkypine tries out another fabulous joke while Churchy LaFemme gets mistaken for a lady (worms were dumped on his head); Howland Owl and Churchy LaFemme try to abscond with Albert's cigars (which involves Pogo dressing in drag); the first World Series; Wiley Cat and Seminole Sam try to cook Pogo for dinner - this sequence is insane - Pogo escapes by imitating a goat (with a magazine that reads \\"Bock is Back\\"), and by putting the kettle over his head and being mistaken for a turtle - this sequence ends with what might be the best strip of the volume: Churchy LaFemme attempts to summarize the plot while eating a \\"san'witch\\" (\\"Then -- mlfgob glf - haw wobs goolop - hug rotksplk\\"); Porkypine then tries to comfort Pogo by telling him \\"We never know who's next\\" and \\"if I was there an' they cooked you, I would not of eaten any.\\"; the volume ends with Albert's run-in with a moose. There are plenty of good strips here.<br /><br />The introduction contains information about Walt Kelly's tenure at Walt Disney studios. R.C. Harvey (who also wrote \\"The Art of the Funnies: An Aesthetic History\\") gives a rundown of some of the politics of the day: Truman won re-election, the red scare scared the pants off of Americans (Kelly, like others, chose to remain silent about it), Mao came to power in China, Alger Hiss gets convicted for spying, etc. All of this while Pogo slowly developed into one of the best comics ever to grace newsprint. Great things take time. Walt Kelly wasted none of it, even in Pogo's formative years.

With the passing of Pope John Paul II and the subsequent election of Benedict XVI last month, this 1997 book officially becomes a little out of date (always inevitable when dealing with a living lineage). Nonetheless, the book will give readers with little knowledge of the papacy the basic story behind how it arrived at its current state (those who already have knowledge of the papacy and its history will likely learn nothing new).<br /><br />It's a dizzying journey, and doubtless much had to be left out to fit the entire 2,000 year journey into one volume (two volumes may have been more appropriate). Still, those not seeking details and the nitty gritty of the papacy can come to a cursory appreciation of the office's history and evolution since its founding during the late Roman Empire.<br /><br />After a 2-4 page preface (not a lot of background) the book leaps into history beginning with St. Peter in the 1st century AD. What follows is far too complex to summarize (which this 240-page book proves more than anything). However, the basic high-level progression of the papacy from St. Peter, to shadowy and difficult beginnings up to the 15th century, to international secular superpower (complete with corruption) through the 18th century, to a humbled return to spiritual leadership of the world's largest church in the 20th century, can be adumbrated. Readers will see most of the highlights of the history, but likely come away with little understanding of the office itself.<br /><br />To be fair, the papacy heartily challenges any attempt at summarization. Being the world's longest running office, it touches the Roman Empire, medieval Europe, countless wars, innumerable countries and peoples, Charlemange, the crusades, the Reformation, the Renaissance, the French Revolution, Napolean, two World Wars, and the modern industrialized world. Any short summary of this lineage is bound to leave out countless details. As an introduction to the basic history of the papacy, this book succeeds fairly well. As an introduction to the office itself, however, it does not fare so well. As long as readers go into this book with the expectation that it's almost purely history, the disappointment shouldn't be too harsh. The book will whet the interest of anyone with a shred of curiosity about this enormous institution. Other books will have to fill in the details, ultimately. To take some examples: why popes traditionally take a new name upon election isn't really even discussed. The section on Gregory I will likely leave readers wondering why he's called \\"Gregory the Great\\". The section on Alexander VI includes more details on Savanarola than the pope himself. The infamous \\"cadaver synod\\" of Stephen VI in the 9th century receives a very brief treatment. The \\"Pope Joan\\" hoax gets mentioned but with almost no detail whatsoever. The terms \\"Vatican I\\" and \\"Vatican II\\" are not used anywhere in the book (the longer \\"First Vatican Council\\" and \\"Second Vatican Council\\" are used instead).<br /><br />On the up side, numerous pictures from all eras pervade nearly every page of the book. The copious pictures alone make the book worthwhile. Sidenotes shed some light on special subjects (e.g., the alleged discovery of the bones of St. Peter, the Carolingian Empire, the crusades, the Fransiscans and Dominicans, the former papal palace at Avignon, the Reformation, the Counter-Reformation, the building of the current St. Peter's Basilica, the formation of Vatican City, etc.).<br /><br />In the end, expect brevity from this book and expect to come out of it with numerous questions. But also expect to have a basic understanding of the history of the world's oldest extant office of authority.

US	52862047	R3RQGQXGRVQT0C	0156260557	282376957	Difficult Loves	Books	4	42	42	N	N	Most of us can identify with at least one of these stories	This collection of stories represents some of Calvino's best early work (the stories were originally compiled in two books from 1949 and 1958). Those who have read \\"The Baron in the Trees\\" (from 1957) will recognize the style at work here. The book burgeons with short stories, 28 in all divided into four sections, and each one includes a discovery of some sort as well as a reflection on the most bizarre of human emotions: love.<br /><br />The stories contained in the book's first section, \\"Riviera Stories\\", seem to have political subthemes. Many deal with the haves and have nots and their interactions. \\"The Enchanted Garden\\" tells of two children that happen along a seemingly deserted villa to discover a utopia or a dystopia - are the people who live in such luxury happy?; \\"A Goatherd at Luncheon\\" explores the gaps between the rich and the poorer classes when the man of the house invites the goat herder to lunch; In \\"Big Fish, Little Fish\\" a very capable young diver comes across an astonishing motherload of fish along with a sobbing sunbather who says she's \\"unlucky in love\\", but every fish the boy pulls out seems to have problems - the downside of a bonanza; \\"Lazy Sons\\" traces a day in the life of two boys who refuse to work in spite of the fulminations of their hard-working parents.<br /><br />The next section, \\"Wartime Stories\\", not surprisingly, contains the most violent and disturbing stories of the book. \\"Hunger at B&eacute;vara\\" explores the desperation of a village caught between two fronts and the hero Bisma who helped save the village, at least temporarily; \\"Going To Headquarters\\" plays with expectations as the tensions between two men, one who might be a spy, and the other who may be his executioner, heighten; \\"One of the Three Is Still Alive\\" probably qualifies as the book's most disturbing story. A man thrown into a deep pit by the enemy discovers that the dead bodies of his comrades broke his fall, he then tries to escape from the pit; \\"Animal Woods\\" is both comedic and tragic. A man tries to shoot a looting German soldier but the livestock of his village keeps interfering.<br /><br />The third section, \\"Postwar Stories\\" deals with a desperate world, one with limited resources and where almost anything goes. \\"Theft in a Pastry Shop\\" tells the hilarious story of criminals who suddenly find themselves on a gluttonous rampage during a robbery; \\"Dollars and the Demimondaine\\" explores a couple's quest for dollars amongst a crowd of rather lusty American sailors. This section deals with the desperate climate of a postwar country. As people suffer some take a no holds barred approach while others find themselves giving up or asking what's it worth.<br /><br />The book's final, and longest, section, \\"Stories of Love and Loneliness\\" is probably the most intriguing. It presages somewhat Calvino's later book \\"Mr. Palomar\\". The style in this section is deeply character driven, and the thoughts and motivations of characters get explained with amazing detail. \\"The Adventure of a Soldier\\" follows a soldier's conquest of a woman seated next to him on a train. He cautiously explores her body to gauge her reaction. Did she pull away? Is she acquiesing? \\"The Adventure of a Bather\\" explores how some see nakedness as a humiliation, so much so that they risk death rather then being seen unclothed. \\"The Adventure of a Photographer\\" depicts a seemingly non-obsessive man's all consuming obsession with capturing life through photographs. He's too engaged to even notice the interest of the beautiful woman acting as his subject; \\"The Adventure of a Nearsighted Man\\" shows just how much a pair of glasses can change one's life. The character can now recognize many things, but other people no longer recognize him. Even the woman he yearns for, and who he's known for years, doesn't recognize him with his glasses on.<br /><br />\\"Difficult Loves\\" provides a suitable umbrella title to package these stories under. Many deal with love in its variousforms: physical, emotional, spiritual, self, political, material. In nearly all cases the characters in the story have difficulty defining or requiting the love they have for others or things. The book explores the nebulous nature of desire and attraction to others and the inevitable hardships of bridging one's desires with reality. Throughout the book, Calvino's writing mesmerizes (even in translation) and pulls the reader in without mercy. The character studies of the final section are incredible in their detail and ambition. It's amazing how much Calvino can cram into a ten page story. The range of emotions is also incredible. The stories evoke laughter, disgust, pity, shame, and of course love.<br /><br />If you want a good read or want to study the art of the short story, look no further than this book by Calvino.

The Peanuts that became world famous begins to show itself in this volume. As great as the first two volumes were, Schultz really hit his stride in 1955-1956. The characters begin to take on the characteristics that they continued to have for over 40 years.<br /><br />The most obvious development is Snoopy's. Before 1955, Snoopy more or less played the role of a typical dog (with some brilliant exceptions). By the end of this volume Snoopy has flowered into the famous dog that most kids still recognize on sight (just go to the Mall of America's \\"Camp Snoopy\\" and observe the number of young kids screeching \\"Snoopy! Snoopy!\\"). He does imitations of animals, of other characters, he dances gleefully, slides on the ice, drips with sarcasm, develops \\"weed claustrophobia\\", demands potato pancakes, adds an air conditioner to his dog house, puts on a sad and happy expression, says \\"If I were a human being I wouldn't even own a dog!\\", swoons to Chopin, and does countless other things that everyone now associates with Snoopy. Though he continued to develop somewhat in later years, the fundamentals of his character can be found in this volume.<br /><br />Linus grows up from the last volume. He speaks constantly, and begins to accomplish the amazing feats that irk Charlie Brown. The blanket shows up with full force. He also uses his finger pistol to \\"BANG!\\" Lucy when she shafts him in some way.<br /><br />Lucy has been toned down a little bit from the last volume, where she resembled nothing less than a destructive whirlwind. She destroys fewer things here, but the insults from her tongue make up for it (one of the best is \\"YOU STRUCK OUT!!\\" on 8/18/56). She continues being over-confidently naive with a definite nasty twist. She also looks at bugs (good one on 7/30/55) and serves Charlie Brown hot root beer (9/29/56).<br /><br />Charlie Brown becomes even more miserable. When Shermy asks him if he knows what he'll be when he grows up, Charlie Brown answers \\"Lonesome\\" (1/31/56). When Patty tells him \\"And that's all you'll ever be!! Just 'Good Ol' Charlie Brown'\\" he stands alone dejected and says \\"What's the sense in living?\\" (2/28/55). Schultz proved back in the 1950s that comic strips are capable of evoking complicated emotional reactions (and he wasn't the first to do so). Should we laugh at Charlie Brown? Feel sorry for him? Wonder how he arrived at his state? Pity him? Probably some of all the above. Peanuts was never a simple \\"HA HA!\\" comic strip. Its complexity and depth hiding under the seemingly banal simple guarantees its staying power and ranking as one of the greatest comic strips ever. Those who say that entertainment cannot be art have the example of Peanuts to contend with.<br /><br />Other characters pervade the strips: Schroeder plays Beethoven and reveals his closet full of Beethoven busts; Shermy hangs around less than in previous volumes; Charlotte Braun even makes some very brief appearances (she's the one who talks loud); by the beginning of this volume even Schultz seemed to recognize that he'd run the gamut of \\"loud jokes\\"; Pigpen continues his crusade against cleanliness (the best pigpen line comes from Charlie Brown: \\"I think he's probably cooled by several layers of clay\\" 7/31/56).<br /><br />No adults appear in this volume (unlike the last one), but they do speak.<br /><br />Longtime fans of Peanuts will recognize a lot of the strips in this volume. But many more probably haven't been reprinted in years. The number of good strips here piles up quickly. As far as content goes, this volume is probably the best so far in the series, which says quite a lot.<br /><br />By continuing this series (scheduled to go for more than a decade) Fantagraphics provides a great service to the comics community.

A recent paperback release of this little book (less than 200 pages) ties it to the movie \\"Downfall\\" (\\"Der Untergang\\") by a disc of text on the cover that reads: \\"Now the major motion picture The Downfall From Newmarket Films\\". Though the book and the movie cover the same general subject and share the same German title, the tie-in is slightly misleading. The 2004 film includes more of the perspective of one of Hitler's secretaries, Traudl Junge, while the 2002 book (translated into English in 2004) takes a more macro view of the goings on in Berlin, and Traudl Junge barely receives mention by name. Nonetheless, both provide great insights and introductions to the last days of the Third Reich (roughly April 16 - when the Soviet offensive against Berlin began - to May 8, 1945 - when what remained of the Third Reich in Berlin surrendered). Exploration of one will likely inspire exploration of the other.<br /><br />This book explores the true horror that unfolded during the battle for Berlin in early 1945. As Fest himself puts it in the foreward: \\"No catastrophe in recent history is comparable to the collapse of Germany in 1945.\\" Newcomers to the subject will learn much about the Third Reich, the end of World War II, and Hitler's twisted ideology of destruction. Those well versed in World War II might not gain more than a good quick read.<br /><br />Fest delineates the catastrophe in clear terms. The civilian population suffered tremendously under the \\"no surrender\\", \\"Clausewitz\\", and \\"scorched earth\\" policies of Hitler. Berlin was systematically dismantled while the Reich called for the unconditional support of the people of Berlin. Young children and the elderly were spontaneously shipped to the front lines. Even when those at the top of the Reich's command knew the battle could not be won against the largely superior Soviet force, they kept up the fight. This doubtlessly caused many needless deaths.<br /><br />Fest also includes chapters for \\"reflection\\" that explore questions arising from the war narrative. Chapter two discusses Hitler's place in German history. Was he an anamoly or the result of a cultural and political progression? Fest juxtaposes Hitler with Bismarck and Frederick the Great, and points out important differences. But the book's most disturbing chapter, \\"The Will to Destroy\\", outlines Hitler's stance on destruction, and argues that one of Hitler's underlying motives all along was base destruction. Fest uses this discussion to elucidate the seemingly bizarre and inexplicable orders Hitler gave from the bunker under the Reich Chancellery up until the end. Did Hitler see himself as a failure before he shot himself? Or did he see himself as a romantic hero &aacute; la Richard Wagner's \\"Reinzi\\"?<br /><br />This book will also dispell any rumors that Hitler survived the Soviet invasion of Berlin. Fest briefly details the legends that arose from the Soviets themselves around alleged Hitler corpses and Rube Goldberg-esque escape plots. The Nazis themselves, for more obvious reasons, hid Hitler's suicide from the German population of Berlin. Fest also gives probable reasons why Hitler and Eva Braun's remains were not found. He also points out areas where information remains sketchy, controversial, or nebulous.<br /><br />This is not a light read. It details suffering, collapse, and the miseries that inevitably arise from a war on the scale of World War II. The only bright side is that it outlines the final hours of the European war, and the end of Nazi rule in Germany. Hopefully the world will never see destruction on that scale again.

Since Pearl Harbor was technically a territory in 1941, United States soil has endured only two attacks since the American Revolution: the War of 1812 and September 11th, 2001. The second of these was a terrorist attack, and still in recent memory. The first of these comprised an invading and occupying army, and a big one at that. After all, the British still ruled the waves in 1814 regardless of seeing defeat at the hands of the upstart American colonies. Doubtless the proud British Empire still felt a slight sting at the humiliating defeat and loss of the colonies not thirty years before. It seems they stopped taking America seriously, and this led to what some have called America's \\"second war of independence\\".<br /><br />The War of 1812 seems almost forgotten these days. Maybe because modern Americans are not comfortable talking about their country's defeats or humiliations in warfare. In 1814 the British agonizingly humiliated the neophyte country by burning its capital. Yes, the city of Washington (it wasn't called Washington D.C. until 1871) was literally sacked on August 24, 1814.<br /><br />Anthony Pitch tells this amazing story with page-turning intensity. The events surrounding the entire War of 1812 unfold. From its inception by the impressment of American sailors by the British, to the violently split public on the question of the war, to the final Battle of New Orleans (fought after the peace treaty was signed), this book tells a great story. In the process one learns about the historical signficance of Baltimore, and the origin of the national anthem (the significance of its lyrics will ring out clearly after reading this book; many people likely sing it without knowing exactly what it's talking about, though only one of the four verses typically gets sung these days).<br /><br />The book begins with a teeth-clenching account of the fate of antiwar publisher Alexander Contee Hanson. Anyone thinking that the United States is a violent place these days has only to read what happens to Hanson and his entourage at the hands of a Baltimore mob. Things used to be much worse.<br /><br />The book also includes descriptions of the early capitol. Things have also vastly improved there. Many in 1812 described it as a fetid swamp.<br /><br />The occupation and burning of Washington by the British gets an entire chapter. Pitch recounts the interior of the President's House and the original Congress building with heartbreaking detail. Even some British solidiers asked their superiors whether destroying the building was the right thing to do. The architecture was apparently that impressive.<br /><br />The book also includes detailed accounts of the war's major battles: Blandesburg, North Point, Baltimore, New Orleans (sometimes compared to Agincourt, and where Andrew Jackson came to public acclaim). Pitch is also not afraid to describe some of the unpleasantries that typically accompany war. Some of these passages stick for a long time.<br /><br />This book serves as a great introduction to a very neglected but pivotal event in American history. After the War of 1812 America saw its reputation rise globally.  And many big names took part: President James Madison, Dolley Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan, and others. Also, many historical documents (e.g., the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence) were miraculously saved from the flames by very driven individuals (names that are now sadly obscure).

It's a super mini-translator and a devourer of brain waves. Everyone who roams the universe needs a Babel Fish swimming in their ear. How else can one understand Vogon poetry? Don't break the stratosphere without one.<br /><br />This book is loads of fun. Besides a quick read, it contains some now famous scenes (almost ubiquitous depending on the circles one runs in). The super computer \\"Deep Thought\\" (a tongue in cheek reference if ever one existed) gives its infamous answer to the \\"ultimate question\\" of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\". Earth gets marked for destruction to clear the way for a \\"hyperspatial express route\\" (but not everyone inhabiting earth comes from earth, or are what they seem). The universe has an irresponsible meglomaniac amoral president (Zaphod Beeblebrox). A man named Slatibartfast gets rebuked for creating fjords in the new Africa. A depressed robot lays facedown in the mud dejected after causing a spaceship to commit suicide. A whale spends its final moments before meteoring onto the surface of the legendary planet of Magrathea. The Improbability Drive of a super space ship creates... well... the improbable. And of course the core of the story involves the great \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\"; an intergalactic tour guide, survival text, and social commentary. A \\"Hitchhiker\\" is the equivalent of an interstellar train jumper. Ford Prefect fits this job description perfectly. He found himself stranded on earth as a result of his hitchhiking. Here he meets Arthur Dent, a seemingly average inhabitant of planet earth. Arthur's house stands in the path of a hungry bulldozer, but Ford Prefect tells him not to worry because \\"the world is ending\\" in about twelve minutes. Great characters, scenes, and ingenious plot devices abound as the pages rapidly turn.<br /><br />The book also has a philosophical dimension. It makes our planet seem like a small, insignificant speck in a manner similar to Voltaire's \\"Micromegas\\". Consequently, it also makes the universe seem like a vast, enormous, incomprehensible mass (which it is). Human insignifigance gets handled, as it should be handled, with humor. This probably explains why the book gets quoted in many philosophical texts: these passages can take some of the edge off of a bare examination of the human condition. So all those struggling with the absurdity of it all should look here for solace and a good laugh. Even those seeking just a good laugh should look here.

Well, here we go again. Another sumptuous collection of one of the best comic strips ever published. Fantagraphics has more than fulfilled its pledge to keep the series going with this the 5th volume of Krazy Kat Sunday strips.<br /><br />This installment, like all previous installments, has amazing bonus material. The first thirty pages include articles about Herriman and Krazy Kat, early pre-Kat Herriman strips (including \\"Baron Bean\\", \\"Mary's Home From College\\", \\"The Amours of Marie Anne MacGee\\", and \\"Embarassing Moments\\"), as well as some rarely seen Krazy Kat dailies. Also, the series editor announces that the next volume will be the first KOLOR KRAZY KAT edition. After 1934, the Kat et al appeared in amazing Kolor. So here stand bound the final black and white Krazy Kat Sunday pages.<br /><br />And as always the book plumps with the justifiably famous Krazy Kat Sunday strips. Some of the strips had to be painstakingly reconstructed from papers that shrunk Herriman's original sized papers to miniscule proportions. All of the reconstructions are listed in the back of the book. Fantagraphics pulled this feat off with much gusto, as anyone can witness in the book.<br /><br />For the initiates amongst us, the strip's main theme is love. Krazy, a Kat with indeterminate gender, loves Ignatz, a temperamental mouse. The only sign of affection Krazy can extract from Ignatz is a brick solidly and violently tossed at his skull. So, brick equals love to Krazy. Meanwhile, Offisa Pupp loves Krazy (in a rather repressed manner) and has made his mission in life to halt Ignatz's vile tossings. The entire strip revolves around this variation on a theme. Helplessness and hope in the face of seemingly hopeless love seeps out between the ink marks. Isn't it romantic?<br /><br />Lastly, February 19th, 1933 has to be amongst Herriman's best \\"silent\\" strips. Krazy and Offisa Pupp ride a see-saw and Ignatz repeatedly picks up the brick, drops it, picks it up, etc... Be sure to translate the espa&ntilde;ol on the wall separating the parties.<br /><br />Carry on, Fantagraphics, carry on...translate the espaol on the wall separating the parties. <br /> <br />Carry on, Fantagraphics, carry on...	2005-01-05

Wittgenstein approached philosophy with a unique perspective - one that changed the field forever. He pushed the focus away from intractable questions and onto the language and syntax of these same questions. Wittgenstein claims that by analyzing the words and grammar of philosophical questions, we can discover where our conceptions of these philosophical questions have gone awry. This represented a radical shift in the way one does philosophy. Though many still fervently question Wittgenstein's claims and methodology, his influence remains steadfast. This tiny book introduces Wittgenstein's take on philosophy, and then applies that take to views of mind. Namely, how Wittgenstein's work challenges the Cartesian and Behaviorist traditions. It is clearly written, well organized, and accessible to a beginner. Nonetheless, the book may still challenge a complete newcomer, but it's not insurmoutable. No previous knowledge is assumed, but, as always, some would facilitate comprehension.<br /><br />Some of the numerous issues that arise include: philosophy as a non-cognitive pursuit distinct from science; language games; the dissolution of philosophical problems as opposed to their solution; the contemporary replacement of Cartesian mind/body with brain/body, thus maintaining the dualism; whether or not a person can \\"own\\" a pain; are experiences \\"privately owned\\"?; the confounding of \\"thinking\\" with \\"inner sight\\"; the expression of a pain does not imply an epistemic condition; the needlessness of positing an \\"inner realm\\" for experiencing one's sensations; how we can directly gain access to the inner goings-on of others (thus there is no absolute epistemic privacy); Wittgenstein's conception that brains don't have sensations, human beings do; behavior is the gateway to the \\"inner\\" of another human being; bodies and minds don't suffer, human beings do. In the end, Wittgenstein puts the totality of a human being in the place of the Cartesian mind/body dualism and the black box of the strict behaviorist. In the final section this idea gets applied to the question \\"Can machines think?\\"<br /><br />Don't expect much biography. The book only scratches the extreme topmost surface of Wittgenstein's life. There is no mention of his upbringing in one of the wealthiest families of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Nor any talk about some of his erratic behavior, including his incredible desire for seclusion. His philosophy, not his life, receives emphasis here.<br /><br />Though the book focuses on issues of mind, its real focus is on Wittgenstein's way of doing philosophy. Mind was just the chosen  topic to delineate his work and make the text easier to follow. Thus, each clear example builds logically on the previous clear example. This book represents a great place to start, but a bad place to stop. Only the rudiments of a foundation get established here. Much more reading is required to fully appreciate the scope and radical nature of Wittgenstein's thought.box of the strict behaviorist.

Even when it engulfed him in the 1960s he seemed suspicious of it and treated it like some kind of dreaded monster. He wanted to be a musician, true, but he didn't want to be a leader or a figurehead for a movement. Many wanted him to take the ropes and lead them... somewhere.<br /><br />So it should come as no surprise that Dylan's \\"memoir\\" - if it can be called that - doesn't bow down to his fan's desires. He tells the stories that are important to him in an intimate way. The writing style reads almost stream of conscience with lots of interesting diversions and sidenotes straddling the main stories. His style itself is down-to-earth, ultra-conversational, incredibly readable, and at times reads as though the words spilled from his head to the page.<br /><br />Some fans, not all fans, may be disappointed by the subject matter Dylan chose to focus on. Of his vast repertoire, \\"Chronicles Volume 1\\" talks in detail about only two albums: \\"New Morning\\" and \\"Oh Mercy\\". Of these two, only \\"Oh Mercy\\" gets an entire dedicated chapter, with detailed explication of the song writing and recording of the album. Most of his albums receive little or no mention.<br /><br />So what is \\"Chronicles Volume 1\\" about? It's more about Dylan himself. He talks about things that may surprise fans such as the impression an old man made on him outside of New Orleans, or the way he tried to counter his image as \\"Messiah\\" or \\"Saviour\\". The latter comprises the most fascinating parts of the book. Dylan outright shows disdain for being summoned as the \\"spokesperson for a generation.\\" He didn't want the title, and didn't think he or anyone else deserved it, but especially himself. He tells horrifying stories about break-ins to his house, protesters marching outside his house calling him to action, and other musicians asking him impossible questions such as \\"where are you taking the scene next, Bob?\\" He explains the evasion of this status as one reason he experimented musically. Though he doesn't mention it by name, the album \\"Nashville Skyline\\" gets presented as a huge musical shift mostly to divert the public from thinking that he's a political or revolutionary leader of some sort. He even briefly mentions 1970's \\"Self-Portrait\\" (though again not by name) as a further effort in this direction. Dylan writes these stories, remarkably, in a way that anyone can identify with. Though most of us are not rock stars, we can identify with privacy and family issues. Dylan amazingly situates his stories from these angles and makes them accessible to almost anyone.<br /><br />Dylan also talks about his upbringing in Hibbing, Minnesota. The town itself isn't mentioned until almost the end of the book, though. Hibbing is still a small town, and Dylan's boyhood house still stands there (years ago I knew a girl who used to date a boy who lived in that same house; she said they'd receive visitors day and night asking to see \\"Bob's old room\\" - as though they were on a pilgrimage). He gives lots of details about his upbringing and his first bands (which keep getting stolen away), and ultimately his move to Minneapolis and then to New York City.<br /><br />The book begins and ends with parallel stories about John Hammond, who signed Dylan to his first Columbia contract. Dylan also discusses the folk scene in New York City, how he got his gig at the Gaslight, and the numerous other famous people he met before he himself was famous. Woody Guthrie plays a large part in the book, not only the obvious influence, but the times Dylan went to visit Guthrie in the hospital. There is a detailed explanation of Dylan's main early influences: Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and a musical number known as \\"Pirate Jenny\\". All of these influences together convinced him to write his own songs (something he never thought he'd do).<br /><br />Overall, \\"Chronicles Volume 1\\" offers an intimate glimpse into Bob Dylan. A lot appears that fans won't expect. It's not inany way a typical rock star's autobiography, and that's a great thing. A must read for Dylan fans or anyone curious about him. Likely, \\"Chronicles Volume 1\\" will go down as another amazing work of Bob Dylan, a very reluctant musical legend of our time.It's not in any way a typical rock star's autobiography, and that's a great thing.

Here collected in one volume are the amazing Li'l Abner strips that featured the shmoo. Most people today still know \\"the shmoo\\", but few probably know the origins and original purpose of this whiskered globule. In 1948 and 1959 Al Capp used the eager to please and adorable character to make poingant points about the American landscape. For those who don't know, the shmoos were self-maintaining providers of all of humanity's essentials. Ask a shmoo for milk, milk appears. Ask for a pineapple, and presto. What's better, shmoos don't need to eat and they reproduce so fast rabbits hang their heads in shame. They also taste great and when gazed upon with hunger they fall over dead with happiness. Ready to eat, as if they wanted it that way. When shmoos appear in Dogpatch (the setting of Li'l Abner) people realize that all of their troubles are over. With all of their needs met, the crooked grocer can no longer take them for all they have (\\"Fo' a whole week ah left yo t'sell our below-standard groceries an' condemned meat - an thar's not a cent in th' till...\\" - the accent reflects the language of the strip), and business starts to fail horribly. Multinational corporations soon feel the sting. Of course this has ramifications for everyone, especially the shmoos. An amazing satire on American society follows, one that still resonates some fifty years later. Along the way the origin of Sadie Hawkins day also pops out of seemingly nowhere. The strips are still hilarious and pointed half a century after their penning. Harlan Ellison's frenetic introduction elucidates some of the nuances of the strip and the hubbub that was the shmoo in 1948. He literally compares the popularity and fuss made by the shmoo in mainstream American culture to Beatlemania. The quality of these strips doesn't dispute his claim. They're hard to put down once looked upon, and they probably won't date anytime soon. A good introduction to Li'l Abner and a piece of American pop culture.	2004-12-28

A not so often appreciated turning point in American history is the election of 1800. It signaled the end of the Federalist party, the rise of party politics, and the beginning of a new path for the nascent union. This short book gives voluminous details of this important campaign in a very readable and exciting narrative. And the campaign was not without its excitement. It unfolds as though it had been written for a novel or a movie script. Almost all of the people involved met surprising or engaging ends. Not only is this book good history, it's also a great story.<br /><br />The book gives overviews of the political careers of all of the major players in the election of 1800. Not only Adams and Jefferson, but C.C. Pinckney, Aaron Burr, and Alexander Hamilton.  By way of these summaries, the administrations of George Washington and John Adams also receive good summaries. This gives the reader a pretty good idea where the nation stood as 1800 approached. The crises of Adams' presidency, such as the war scare with France in the late 1790s, the Alien and Sedition Acts, and Alexander Hamilton's control issues all loomed. John Ferling spoke about the book in Minnesota this past October. He said that while researching this book his assessment concerning Jefferson and Adams increased tremendously (he even alluded that he previously held a somewhat negative view of Jefferson), while his view of Alexander Hamilton decreased greatly. The book does depict Hamilton as a power-hungry, potentially menacing schemer that actually held the strings behind Adams' cabinet. Thus Hamilton is to blame for the provisional army and the Alien and Sedition Acts, not Adams. Ferling also says that part of the American legacy is indebted to Hamilton, but overall Hamilton fares badly in this text. John Adams fares rather well (which will surprise readers of Rosenfeld's \\"American Aurora\\" where Adams is pretty much equated with despotism, incompetence, and monarchy). Here Adams seems more like a very capable politician - apart from some obvious blunders - caught inbetween the different factions of his own Federalist party (the \\"Ultras\\" who follow Hamilton, and the more moderate). Another surprising fact is Adams' uniqueness amongst the other players of never having owned slaves. Thomas Jefferson's ups and downs also receive a fair showing: His slaves, his monetary excesses, his suffocating debt, his weakness as a public speaker, and his affair with his slave Sally Hemmings. The major players receive farily balanced portraits. None are totally romanticized or completely demonized.<br /><br />Those who think that dirty politics and negative advertising are endemic to modern American elections will receive a shock. The election of 1800 was rife with schemes, defamations, backstabbing, rumors, and questionable polling practices. In many ways it resembled modern elections in its tireless hurling of mud and brickbats across party lines. Ferling discusses the role of the press in this process. Each side had its newspaper that fired accusations at its opposition. This greatly resembles the current publishing wars between the likes of Bill O'Reilly, Anne Coulter, Micheal Moore, and Al Franken. Dirty politics are in no way the exclusive capital of the modern age.<br /><br />The election itself reached the pinnacle of nail-biting intensity. A tie in the electoral vote, a deal struck between the tied contenders gets broken, the election goes to the house who vote over thirty times, threats of civil war loom, and finally a sole member of the opposition rises to the occasion to keep the situation from spiraling completely out of control. How the exchange of power in 1801 occurred without bloodshed approaches the miraculous. The book outlines the amazing details.<br /><br />Readers will leave this book with a deep appreciation of the importance of the election of 1800. America would never be the same again, and many of the major players meet interesting, almost jaw-dropping, ends. Highly recommended for readers wanting to know the pivotal events that shaped the early United States.w-dropping, ends.

His career consisted of reaching into new territory, digging up new ways of telling tales, and of mirroring these tales to life and existence as we humans experience it. Calvino stands as a pioneer of storytelling. He tells new and fresh stories in an age when the story spicket seems to churn out redundancies or mere variations on themes. \\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler\\" is one of Calvino's true masterpieces and an examplar of how he dug up these new forms and ways of storytelling.<br /><br />First off, you (yes YOU!) are a character in this novel. You are directly referred to in the second person and called \\"Reader\\". The first section discusses how you approach reading and how you approach the subject of books in general. Both reading and books apparently obsess you, according to the text, and this obsession (your obsession) drives most of the novel's bizarre plot. Unfortunately, your obsession and your need for resolution gets foiled at almost every turn. Bad printing, unfinished stories, novels cut into pieces and distributed, deconstruction, stolen manuscripts, forgeries, arrests or fake arrests, revolutionary groups, censorship. Throughout the novel, all of these aggravate your need for a good story with a good ending. Resolution seems a far off dream in the face of a world that, beyond your control, keeps you from your desires. Each novel you find (you find ten of them in Calvino's book) terminates suddenly at a moment of excessive suspense. How do these stories end? Who knows? Enter the obsession. Along the way you meet another reader (referred to as \\"Other Reader\\") who you fancy and who then joins you on your quest to find the remainder of the unfinished stories. Will you end up in bed together?<br /><br />You navigate many familiar and strange locales in your obsessive hunt: a book shop, the Department of Bothno-Ugaric Languages, a rather ornery and opiniated literary study group, a nervous publisher's office, a revolutionary translator's letters, the Other Reader's perspective, the Other Reader's apartment, the letters of a famous but frustrated author, a taxi - or a fake taxi, a prison - or a fake prison, a room containing a machine that analyzes novels, the Director General of Ircania's office - where you hear about brilliant censorship schemes, and finally, to a library. But you find yourself far away from your beloved Other Reader. Your obsession has sent you packing away, entangled you in bizarre governmental and revolutionary activities, and now you need to wake up. Hopefully you do. Do you?<br /><br />\\"If On A Winter's Night A Traveler\\" contains too much juicy material to summarize. But it's disturbing in places, laugh out loud funny in others, heartbreakingly poetic in still others. It's far easier to experience than to explain. What it will do is make you think about reading and why people read, and then about stories, their construction, and why people write, and then about resolution, then about people, then about society, government, technology, translations, ideologies, connections, disconnections, love, beginnings, endings, and existence in general. It may help you to realize what is important in life, and, despite our need for resolution and our frustrated groping for unanswerable questions in the face of many forces we can't possibly control, we still manage to find anchors to help us through it all.

Mel Gibson's depiction of Christ's Passion has stirred a vertiginous array of reactions. Some lovingly praise the movie's moving depiction of Jesus' gift to humanity while others condemn it as a perversion of Christianity, a racist diatribe, or a form of [...]. Not only that, the film's influence, ubiquity, and controversy seem to preclude any rational discussion amongst its supporters and detractors. Film reviews supply the most salient evidence of this. Neutral or middle of the road reviews rarely appear, and most reviews get crammed with overbearing for or against hyperboles. This book, intended for the general reader, attempts to remedy this seemingly hopeless situation. It brings together the viewpoints of Christians (Roman Catholics, Evangelicals and Protestants), Jews, Mormons, and even Atheists into one non-inflammatory volume. It succeeds greatly in this task. The book does not sell or indoctrinate one viewpoint on Gibson's film. Nor does it ever try to impose on the reader a \\"correct\\" stance. Each of its 20 essays of course has a specific point of view on the film and the issues it raises, but the book as a whole is balanced. Some essays read like theology, others like Cultural Theory, even others like philosophy. A virtual salad of styles awaits.<br /><br />The topics covered by the book are as diverse as the authors. Five main sections divide the essays. The first deals with the horrific violence portrayed in the film; the second with charges of anti-semitism; the third with the film's accuracy to scripture; the fourth with the \\"why?\\" of the passion; the fifth with ethical questions surrounding the Passion. Each section presents level headed for and against positions on the issues. Some of the issues discussed include: Is the violence justified? How does the movie deal with atonement? Does the movie distort Jesus and scripture? What motivated the making of the movie? How do Christians and Jews view the film differently? Can we forgive Judas, and if so, how? What influences did Gibson draw from in making the movie? Did Christ receive due process? What can the Passion teach us about our own mortality? How are women depicted in the film? How do Christ's and Socrates' deaths appear similar or different? Is the Passion anti-semitic? Could Jesus have chosen differently? What theory of nonviolence did Jesus subscribe to? The book also elucidates some of the devices and Biblical references Gibson utilized to make his point (and just what his point was gets debated throughout the book). Those who have seen the movie and are not familiar with scripture will learn a lot. Those seeking elucidation of the principles of Christianity portrayed in the film will also learn much. Open minded readers of any bend will likely finish the book with their extreme viewpoints dulled somewhat. The book simply does a great job of presenting the good arguments on all sides. If the book does have a unifying message it's that \\"I'm right, you're wrong\\" is not the best attitude to take towards this film. The book won't make one love the film if one hates it or hate the film if one loves it, but it will make one think more deeply about the issues it raises.<br /><br />Along the way, many big names and concepts get introduced. Some are theological, some philosophical, some ethical. Apart from the obvious Biblical names that appear, many other big names appear, such as Aristotle, Plato, Nietzsche, Boethius, Augustine, Hegel, Aquinas, Heidegger, Socrates, C.S. Lewis, Buber, Tolkien, Elaine Pagels, and even Dan \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" Brown. Probably the best time to read this book is after seeing the movie at least once and before viewing it again. This book will open up new interpretations and perspectives on the movie whether it inspires or repulses.

Anyone interested in the issues that make up current debates in metaphysics should read this book. It opens up an entirely new vocabularly and conceptual scheme for those with little or no prior knowledge of the subject. Working through the chapters, arguments, and positions will greatly facilitate comprehension of more technical philosophical papers. At the same time the book presents the material in a technical fashion; it reads like real philosophy, as it should. Arguments receive in depth treatment and important sides to issues get presented fairly. For a beginner, this book will present many challenges. But overcoming these will reap great rewards. Probably the best thing to do after completing the book is to read it again. Of course this principle holds true for a lot of philosophy books, but since this one builds a foundation a second deep reading becomes almost essential.<br /><br />Seven chapters cover some of the biggest issues in metaphysics. Each chapter builds on its predecessors, so the book doesn't hold up well to random browsing. It should be comprehended linearly. Starting off, the nearly ancient debate between nominalists and realists (with a small 'r') fills two chapters. Arguments for and against both positions take up most of the space (e.g., abstract entities, predication, Ockham's Razor, etc., along with a delineation of the various types of nominalism - austere, metalinguistic, trope theory). Chapter three discusses the arguments relating to the nature of concrete particulars, or the 'substratum' versus the 'bundle' theory. The nature of propositions gets a fair shake in chapter four; are they abstract necessarily existing entities or just talk about regular old concrete objects? Next, David Lewis' eyebrow-raising view of possible worlds and modality is coherently outlined in chapter five. Here the discussion get really juicy and complex. Modality is no picnic. Do possible worlds actually exist in the same manner of our own world or are possible worlds merely potential actual worlds that never obtained the level of an 'actual world'? Chapter six revisits the concrete particulars examined in chapter three, but now with the element of time included. Two views, endurantism and perdurantism, are juxtaposed along with two theories of time, presentism and eternalism. Finally, chapter seven gets to the bottom of many of the book's debates, which can be, cursorily, ground down to the question of human beings' connections between language and the world. Do languages actually refer to a mind-independent world or is the world we talk about inextricably linked to our sensory and conceptual processes? These questions explode in the debate between Realists (this time with a capital 'R') and anti-Realists. Anti-Realists challenge the 'traditional' notion of a direct connection between language and a mind-independent world. The idea of the 'inscrutablility of reference' (from W.V.O. Quine, though with a specific interpretation by the author and Hilary Putnam) provides meat for the anti-Realist's argument. This final chapter sees Realists and anti-Realists duking it out over these issues. The chapter, and the entire book, provide plenty of food for the brain to chew on.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author argues for an Aristotelian-flavored \\"being 'qua' being\\" approach to metaphysics. This is very apparent in the book's excellent introduction as well as in the final chapter (aptly titled \\"The challenge of anti-Realism\\"). Though he makes his preference explicit, the arguments against his position still get a very fair shake. The author's position in no way degrades the quality of for-and-against delineation of arguments. So, even if readers do not agree with the author's overall stance, they can still obtain much useful knowledge.<br /><br />Though the book's subtitle reads \\"a contemporary introduction\\" it is not an easy read. Major universities have used it for courses (the University of Minnesota's Philosophy department used it in a 5-XXX level class). Still, the book is not inaccessible to any careful general reader. It just takes some work. And that work, especially to someone seeking an entryway into the foundations of current metaphysical debates, will pay off in droves.ophy department used it in a 5-XXX level class).

In the two years since this book appeared, Flash's popularity has skyrocketed. Professional studios now use it for broadcast. Numerous independent animators use it to show their work to millions on the web. The term \\"Flash\\" has even become an unindelible part of web nomenclature. Not only that, it has liberated countless wannabe animators. It has made the once impossible possible.<br /><br />To a person just starting out in animation, the immense learning curve involved may not make itself readily apparent. Not only should animators know how to draw (on paper or on a computer) but they should also know some basic animation principles. On outlining these principles, this book does a pretty good, but not indepth, job. When discussing the use of Flash, it's even more sketchy. There's a reason for this. In the introduction the author states: \\"This book is intended to teach you about animation first and Flash second.\\" So the focus on animation theory shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.<br /><br />So no, this book won't teach anyone everything they need to make incredible Flash animation. No one book can do that. However, it will give wannabe animators a great basic foundation for continuing on with Flash animation. Consequently, the book's title seems a little vague and could mislead people who don't skim the introduction before buying it. Those who buy the book thinking that THIS IS ALL I NEED!!! will likely end up disappointed.<br /><br />Still, the book covers a lot of ground. Lots of juicy stuff gets introduced here for newcomers. The most important of which include: some basic animation history up to the time of Flash; Stretch and Squash; basic character design; flexibility and follow-through; staging; exaggeration; arcs; walk and run cycles; dialogue. Also, regardless of the author's \\"Flash second\\" claim a lot of Flash topics get discussed: timeline; drawing; tweening; frame rates; symbols; Onion skinning; tips on special effects (fire, water, lightning, glass); file size issues; sound. The final chapter on preparing Flash for broadcast is probably a bit dated by now, but again it includes some useful information.<br /><br />Also, the book attempts to be version-independent. Flash 5 is mentioned in chapter 10, but apart from that no references to versions appear. This fits with the overall goal of the book: to give a bird's eye view of what it means to use Flash for making animation.<br /><br />The interviews that scatter the book don't elucidate much. They really only give a cursory view of working in animation. Unfortunately, the audio interview with Iwao Takamoto (on the CD) contains a lot of noise. Parts of it are unlistenable.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Flash Animator\\" would satisfy a beginner who wants to learn about the various principles underlying animation. Knowing these principles will improve anyone's animation abilities. Readers who have animated in Flash and have already read books on animation may pick up some tips or new ways to go about accomplishing an effect, but no new startling revelations will bop the cortex., glass); file size issues; sound.

US	52862047	R14NANU3BZRGXS	1560976144	382953419	The Complete Peanuts 1953-1954 (Vol. 2)  (The Complete Peanuts)	Books	5	28	31	N	Y	These kids were NASTY!!!!	Maybe in its latter days Peanuts became more of a cute kids strip, but in its early days it epitomized childhood cruelty. Sandcastles are cheerfully kicked and smashed to the ground, kids constantly discuss why they hate each other, they manipulate each other for personal gain, they yell, scream, throw things, hit each other, kick other people's possessions and on and on. It's an onslaught of bare raw human nature in the form of little human blobs. Pure Id reigns in this domain.<br /><br />Lucy comes of age in this volume. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the January 24th, 1954 Sunday page (pg. 167). She kicks everyone's prized possessions across the room while yelling \\"That's what I think of your 'ol stamp collection!!\\" and \\"That's what I think of your ol' stupid marbles!!\\" The last panel has all of the kids running after her mob-style as she pleads \\"I'm frustrated and inhibited. And nobody understands me.\\" Another strip has Lucy whacking poor baby Linus on the head. When Charlie Brown pleads \\"What did you hit him for?\\" Lucy replies \\"Because he was there!\\" (May 24th, 1954, pg. 219). She's pretty nasty throughout to pretty much everyone. But she also has a whimsical side such as when she's counting stars or raindrops.<br /><br />Charlie Brown's metamorphosis into the loser we all know starts to gain momentum. Early on he could be defiant, obnoxious, loud, or cunning. By the end of the volume he's more depressive and shunned than ever.<br /><br />Linus is still a baby throughout, but some words emerge, usually in defiance of Lucy's nasty schemes to get him in trouble. The security blanket shows up also for the first time. Even Charlie Brown experiments with it.<br /><br />Schulz also took some risks in May, 1954. He introduced visible adults into the strip for the first (and probably the last) time. A series of Sunday strips finds Charlie Brown and Lucy playing in a golf tournament. They are surrounded by adults. The juxtaposition of very realistically drawn adults and little abstract circular kids makes for a disorientating visual experience.<br /><br />Pig-Pen appears for the first time in 1954. He's more of a one-gag character and not as strong as the rest of the crew. The same can be said for Charlotte Braun. She appeared then disappeared forever in late 1954. Her gag? She talks too loud.<br /><br />And of course Snoopy. There's loads of great Snoopy strips in this volume. Many are purely sight gags, but Snoopy does begin to \\"talk\\" around this time. One of the best Snoopy strips is October 11th, 1954 (pg. 279) where Charlie Brown tries to take Snoopy's picture. It's purely visual but a sure sign of things to come.<br /><br />It's amazing that strips featuring old cathedral televisions and radios, and Brownie-style cameras can still evoke outloud laughter. The humor strikes at many different places, and works on many levels, from the physical to the intellectual and thus appeals to many kinds of people. Something lurks here for almost everyone. Some people could even find parts of the strip depressing. After all, kids get socially shamed, shunned, physically hurt, abused, and abandoned over and over. But depicting the entire cast as cute children somehow turns these situations into comedy. They all seem innocent, but they are anything but. In fact, part of Schulz's contribution was revealing the underside of the cute and innocent. These strips seem to tell us: just because something IS cute doesn't mean that it's incapable of cruelty. He helped expand the possibilities of the cute 'lil cartoon character.<br /><br />Even though the strip later fell headfirst into rampant commercialism, these early strips reveal an energy and edge unmatched in most mainstream comics (even today, especially today). When the golden age of newspaper comics gets a historical review sometime in the future, Peanuts will likely stand out as the exemplar of the medium.<br /><br />Lastly, Fantagraphics comes through again as the champion of classic comics. This volume continues the great design and layout of the first volume (though arguably the strips could be bigger and the Sunday strips could be in color). Walter Cronkite introduces and a short Schulz biography closes. Keep them coming.champion of classic comics.

US	52862047	R1WG1PO5ZWQGAM	0815411901	202593337	Captain Beefheart: The Biography	Books	3	28	30	N	Y	Tells a story, but Van Vliet remains obscure...	Don Van Vliet (alias \\"Captain Beefheart\\") has become one of the most elusive and enigmatic figures in rock history. Strangely, a veritable paucity of information exists on his life and work. Internet webpages and blurbs in CD booklets provide one of the largest current trove of insights. This leaves a large knowledge gap for the curious, and there's plenty to be curious about. His self-abdication as the king of avant-garde rock (or so subsumed by many) to the painterly recluse represents a massive - and intriguing - change for an artist to undertake. Also, he's disappeared. Sightings of and interviews with Van Vliet have gone the way of the dodo bird. Add to that rumors of failing health, and the gossip fountains spurt prodigiously.<br />Given such a situation, those interested in the life of Van Vliet must embrace the appearance of a new biography (or at least a reissue; this book was originally published in 2000, and, according to the title page, was republished in 2002 with \\"textual emendations\\"). Surprisingly, not many biographies of \\"Captain Beefheart\\" have made their way into print. Or maybe this shouldn't surprise fans. The lack of material, especially valuable primary source material (in the form of interviews with Van Vliet himself) would daunt the most driven biographer wannabe.<br />In light of the startling limitations, one has to give Mike Barnes some credit for this undertaking. Unfortunately, the lack of really juicy material shows in this 365 page linear telling of Van Vliet's life. Plenty of dates and amusing and insightful anecdotes appear. And if one wants to know just the basic story behind Captain Beefheart and His/The Magic Band and his subsequent (or continuous) morphing into Don Van Vliet the painter, then dig in. Unfortunately, what one won't find is depth. Don Van Vliet the man and his methodologies remain in relative obscurity by the book's end. True, what happened to him gets a fair outline, but not much else. The book generally feels like a compilation of magazine, audio, and television interviews with sequeways filled in by the author. Consequently, anyone who has undertaken a study of Van Vliet will find much of the material familiar. Don't expect any earth shattering surprises.<br />Other flaws not related directly to lack of information also exist. The author's abrupt transitions to the first person are jarring. This happens only a few times, but when it does, the flow suffers. Placing these personal reflections into footnotes or endnotes would preserve the narrative flow (particularily the author's recollections of trying to get an interview with Van Vliet; they're very interesting but would have fit better in an epilogue or an appendix; they also come off like an apology for the lack of material). In addition, typos dot the text frequently enough to further strain the flow.<br />The photograph section presents another puzzle. The book covers all of Van Vliet's life (up to around 2001), but the photos only cover the years 1980 - 1982. Maybe permissions for photos were difficult to obtain? The included photos are great, but they beg the question as to why only an extremely small part of Van Vliet's life made it into this section.<br />Not only that, the book does not include an index, so returning to specific passages becomes tedious. Of course indexers cost money, so dropping the index probably helped the book get into print. Still, it makes the book less useful as a reference.<br />On a lighter note, one of the most amusing anecdotes related by Barnes is Van Vliet's run-in with Bono of U2. Following an offer made by Bono to tour with U2 and collaborate, Van Vliet supposedly kept asking his friends \\"Who's this Bongo?\\"<br />Lastly, the multifarious members of various Magic Bands get airtime here. Some of them feel cheated. Others feel fortunate. Some even feel cheated and fortunate. Many of their stories clash with Van Vliet's own version. In the end, what exactly happened is difficult to reconstruct.<br />Overall the book reads quickly and tells the story of Van Vliet. Those who have no prior knowledge of Captain Beefheart apart from the music will learn a great deal. Longtime fans will probably not learn too much. Barnes is obviously a big fan, and his enthusiasm shows. Nonetheless, the book contains flaws, but not insurmountable ones. Perhaps this book will lay the groundwork for a more detailed study in the future. Or at the very least get Van Vliet's music some more well-deserved press.ads quickly and tells the story of Van Vliet.

If you're a Hello Kitty fan, you'll think this book is the cutest thing in the world. If you're a lover of kitsch you'll likely laugh long and hard at every page. If you have no idea who or what Hello Kitty is, you'll probably stare in disbelief that anyone would ever publish something like this. In any case you'll enjoy the book because it is cute, funny, and a little bizarre. After all, it's a book full of professionally photographed stuffed animals juxtaposed with haiku poems. This sort of thing just doesn't pop up every day.<br /><br />You can see Hello Kitty in America (\\"the red, white, and cute\\", reads the haiku); Hello Kitty in France (\\"we seek pink berets\\"); Hello Kitty in space; Hello Kitty flying a stuffed airplane; Hello Kitty as the devil; Hello Kitty as a mermaid; Hello Kitty by the pool; Hello Kitty in the pool; Hello Kitty surfing; Hello Kitty in a kimono; Hello Kitty roller blading; Hello Kitty dressed in what looks like black leather. Just about every tasteful thing you can imagine Hello Kitty doing is in this book.<br /><br />Two designers from Sanrio (yes, the Japanese company that created Hello Kitty) collaborated with a Basho scholar from Pennsylvania to create this book. Altogether it makes for a very entertaining read no matter what level one approaches it at. It definitely scores points for uniqueness.	2004-10-31

This is probably Micheal Moore's most important book, mostly because it is written by soliders, past and present, of the United States Military. True, they don't represent the only, or probably even the majority, of the feelings of the troops in Iraq (some of the letters even attest to this). Nonetheless, they do reveal, to those of us who have absolutely zero exposure to the military, that the enlisted are not all a bunch of rabid mindless killers, or trained to be so. The military can teach principles of justice, of fairness, and dignity (the letter from the anonymous former infantry drill instructor on page 127 is just one great example of this). There is still honor in serving in the armed forces when those forces are put to just use. Many of these letters reveal soldiers that don't feel they have been put to a \\"just use\\". Their voices should at least be heard, and this book provides that voice, and thus supports the troops (far more than a car magnet or a mass e-mail ever could).<br /><br />The book also includes letters sent to Moore by relatives of soliders. These are some of the hardest to get through. Stories of lost husbands, wives and children. Many of them feel that their loved ones were not lost for a good cause. Again, this book gives them a voice. These letters evoke the image of the famous photo of Lyndon Johnson listening to tapes from his son-in-law from Vietnam. I hope that this photo is displayed prominently in the White House as a constant reminder to our leaders of the costs of war all the way to the top.<br /><br />So, how does one answer the obvious (and to some definitive) criticism that these letters could be faked? This is a question that should be asked of anything anyone reads, no matter what the political slant. It's good to ask such questions when reading anything from Micheal Moore to Ann Coulter to the New York Times. This book presents a hard case since the people voicing such views could get in trouble. Of course, not all of the letters are anonymous. Some even give their full names (see letters on pages 12, 13, 14, 17, 29, 33, 37, 40, 43, 45, 47, 49, 60, 61, 65, 67, 75, 78, and 83 - some even give their rank, location, and division - in the introduction Moore says he urged all to remain anonymous but many refused). I think that speaks to the credibility of these letters (since the names could be checked).<br /><br />Micheal Moore has become a force to be reckoned with.

Reading George Herriman's \\"Krazy Kat\\" can evoke the response \\"this is from the first half of the twentieth century?!?!\\" In like manner, reading Walt Kelly's \\"Pogo\\" evokes the response \\"this is from the 1940s!!?!?!\\" The reality hits home when various animals (Albert the alligator, Pogo Possum, and Chug Chug Curtis the traveling duck) discuss the Dewey/Truman election of 1948 around page 15. Then Kelly's achievment really hits home: even early \\"Pogo\\" hasn't really dated itself for almost sixty years. The jokes (and even most of the puns) still smell fresh. The characters couldn't be more intriguing and the social and political undertones (though not as prevalent in this volume) couldn't be more inspiring. It only takes a few pages to understand why \\"Pogo\\" repeatedly receives accolades such as \\"one of the best comic strips ever\\".<br /><br />So many highlights appear in this volume that listing them would take bajillions of words. Some of the standouts include: Albert drinks the \\"Frog Child\\"; The campaign for sherrif; Howland Owl's School (which includes the book critic \\"Orville the Scrooch Owl\\"); Porkypine's \\"Don't like anybody!\\" (which appears twice).<br /><br />The introduction includes a load of useful background information on Walt Kelly. It also explains why some strips seem like repeats in this volume. Fantagraphics dug back into \\"Pogo's\\" pre-syndicated days. The strips that appeared in the ill-fated \\"Star\\" newspaper provide interesting juxtaposition with Kelly's syndicated work. The artwork improves. Some of the jokes improve. Basically, sometime between January and May of 1949 Kelly polished \\"Pogo\\" and sold it to a syndicate. In the latter he reused and refined some of the strips that ran in the \\"Star\\". Fantagraphics prints them all.<br /><br />The introduction also helps readers sort through the morass of characters that pervade \\"Pogo\\". Apparently the cast ended up numbering into the thousands (counting all the insects and animals that appeared over the years); but the strip mainly revolves around a base set of characters.

If Lord of the Rings were much funnier and pervaded with humor, it would be very much like Bone. Not that Bone isn't a serious work, because it is in every way - It's probably one of the comic book masterpieces of our time. Only that the story sometimes twists and turns on laugh out loud plot devices. Many of the characters are funny (Phoney Bone, the stupid stupid rat creatures, Smiley Bone, Bartelby, Gran'ma) but also have a downright serious side (Gran'ma has one VERY serious side; don't mess with her and definitely don't mess with her cows). The story itself is even funny in ways, but it amazingly maintains tension with some horror and shock mixed in. It's adventure, comedy, horror, and fantasy wrapped in a shell of great comic artwork.<br /><br />Hidden beneath the adventures, jokes, and great artwork also lies some social commentary. When Phoney Bone convinces the townsfolk that dragons are an immediate threat to their safety and, since he's a dragonslayer, they should give him absolute control over the town, this hits almost a little too close to home. Phoney represents greed on steroids. Other innocents get pulled into his plans for money and power (he doesn't seem too concerned with glory or the well being of society in general). Nonetheless, the entire story turns on Phoney's schemes, and they play a vital role in the plot.<br /><br />Other highlights include: the Great Cow Races; Fone Bone's infatuation with Thorn; Ted the Bug (what an amazing character); the two stupid rat creature's travails with Kingdok (one of them loves quiche); the slow uncovering of Gran'ma and Thorn's true identities; Smiley Bone's pet rat creature; Fone Bone's run ins with The Great Red Dragon; the Giant Bees (\\"Gimmee dat Cigar!\\"); Phoney Bone's first very creepy run in with The Hooded One. There's plenty more. These some 1300 pages are crammed with highlights.<br /><br />Bone was originally released in numerous comic books (from 1991 to 2004) which were then collected into 9 larger books, and now all nine books are compiled into this one chunky volume. This book is slightly smaller in physical size than the other books, so some of the extreme detail of the art is lost (but most people won't care).

Nothing beats a good context for picking up foreign language vocabulary. Many books simply push lists of words into the reader's head and hope that something catches to make the words stick. Unfortunately, rote memorization unaccompanied by usage typically results in horrificly low retention rates. This book has none zip nada of those problems. True, it includes lists of vocabulary words and lots of them. But the comics set it apart from other books that claim to expand one's vocabulary. Instead of sitting on a neuron impatiently waiting for an opportunity for use, the comics give the words a context. The word lists then becomes more of a map to help navigate the comics, and retention skyrockets.<br /><br />The comics focus more on European Spanish (or Espa&ntilde;ol Iberico) than American Spanish. Nonetheless, the word and phrase lists also include references and idioms unique to Latin American Spanish. Words and phrases not used in Latin American Spanish get an asterisk next to them, so it's easy to tell them apart. Regardless, this book will probably better suit those wanting to speak Spanish in Spain. But anyone learning Spanish can benefit greatly from it.<br /><br />Probably the best way to get the most out of this book is to read all of the vocabulary for a particular comic first, then read that same comic a few times through to cement the words in memory. Repetition and context will fuel retention, and returning to previously read comics will yield surprising results. Some words will stick like paste on a first reading; others may take a few times through. Nonetheless, many rewards await those who read through the entire book more than a few times.<br /><br />Lastly, this is not a beginner's Spanish book. It assumes much foreknowledge from the reader. Basic grammar and very basic vocabulary are not covered in any depth. Probably the best time to go through this book would be after completing a basic Spanish class or book (i.e., know more than just present indicative verb conjugation, sentence structure, same basic vocabulary, pronouns, etc.). The level of learning can best be described as beginner intermediate. Those in the advanced level will likely breeze through it. So get going, read some comics, and learn a load of Spanish words.dicative verb conjugation, sentence structure, same basic vocabulary, pronouns, etc.).

Calvino created many books that utterly defy description and evade simple laconic summaries. \\"Invisible Cities\\" provides the exemplary of all exemplaries for these traits. This book is to be experienced more than discussed or analyzed. Each reader will likely mine personally unique reflections and meanings from the multitudinous vignettes and themes. Though physically very thin it's actually about three miles thick with meaning. Reading it in one sitting gives the feeling of overeating, like some things ingested were not quite fully digested. This leaves a lingering feeling of regret that one may have eaten too quickly.<br /><br />Probably the best thing to do after reading \\"Invisible Cities\\" is to read it again soon. On a second reading, voluminous nuances begin to peep out from between the lines of text. Then read it again and again and again... every reading reveals something new.<br /><br />The writing, like all of Calvino's works in translation, is stunning and hypnotic. Most of the book contains second person descriptions of cities, real or imagined, past, present, or future. Discussions between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo bookend these one to three page narratives. The two famous personages often wax philosophical. Sometimes Kublai Khan accuses Marco Polo of lying, or laziness, or stubborness. Kublai Khan wants nothing more than to possess his empire, and he looks to Marco Polo's tales for assistance. But almost immediately something seems awry. The historical Marco Polo died around 1324, but the tales he spins include references to radios, parasols, oil refineries, airports, and other very twentieth century items. Something far juicier than historical fiction begins to unfold.<br /><br />Though the subject of the book encompasses much more than a mere reflection on cities, it manages to evoke much about their unique nature. Each city contains everything it was and everything it will be. A city contains perspectives, opinions, relationships, inhabitants, and exiles. Calvino pushes his theme almost to its limit. Section nine, the book's final section, becomes almost surreal but still manages to leave a lasting message.<br /><br />Some standout sections include: the description of the spider-web city supported by veins of ropes; the city where the visitor sees the faces of people he or she once knew in its inhabitants; the city formed by men who dreamt of a naked woman running through city streets; all of the passages are ultimately noteworthy, but some contain shocking beauty. Discernible patterns also weave through the sections and thier titles, and the table of contents itself reveals a pattern.<br /><br />Written between the lines of this amazing book is the ineffability of all being. Past, present, and future, when put under the microscope, can become incomprehensible and overwhelming. At the same time past, present, and future appear present in everything. \\"Invisible Cities\\" reflects this somewhat mind-bending characteristic of reality. Similar to many of the cities Marco Polo relates to Kublai Khan, the book itself is a work of imagination that attempts to envelop the past, present, and future with the analogy of cities and their physical and metaphysical stratifications. It also points out that we all need anchors in this puzzling and fuzzy infinity. Marco Polo reveals his. Does Kublai Khan? Finishing the book will leave readers with a sense that something monumental has occurred, but words won't do justice to this feeling.

Can historical source material make for an exciting and engaging read? This book answers that question in the extreme affirmative. It contains documents mainly from the 18th century, but it reads like a political thriller. It also provides valuable peeks into the formation of the United States as we know it today. Magma hot controversy surrounded that formation. The press on all sides fervently spewed accusations that seem nearly heretical even today. Did John Adams want to be king? Was George Washington a bumbling and incompetent general? Did the French win the revolution for us, thanks to the diplomatic powers of Benjamin Franklin? Was Thomas Jefferson an atheistical French sympathizer? In light of these claims, Who is really the \\"father of our country?\\" Many unconventional opinions see light in this book. Some cherished political figures get shredded to bits, sometimes by their own words and sometimes by the words of others. In the end, no one is safe from abuse. Not even Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. Shocking claims await on almost every page.<br /><br />The drama begins in the city of Philadelphia in 1798. At this time it served as the capital for the very young United States (the government moved to Washington in 1800). John Adams holds the presidency. George Washington still has a year to live. Benjamin Franklin has been dead for eight years. His grandson, Benjamin Franklin Bache runs a newspaper called the Aurora General Advertiser (or just \\"The Aurora\\"). For reporting on certain congressmen's less than professional behavior (spitting, insults, etc), congress bars the paper from the floor of both houses. The Aurora gets shoved into the balconies of congress, far above the whispers of congressman that Bache so often reported on without approval from the House Speaker. Congress marks the Aurora as a troublemaker. This begins the first section of the book, where the Aurora accuses president Adams of wanting to be king of the United States. More than mere conjecture or metaphor spurned this accusation. Adams presented his idea of \\"titles\\" to Congress on May 9, 1789. He suggested a verbose title for the president: \\"His Highness, the President of the United States of America and Protector of the Rights of the Same.\\" Along with this, he proposed that the president and all  senators should hold their offices for life. These ideas deeply disturbed Bache, and the exposure of Adams' goals became a predominant goal of his paper. In addition, Bache accused the Adams administration of purposefully alienating France. The Aurora and other news sources of 1789 reported on the terrifying prospect of a French invasion of the United States. It never happened, and Bache yelled foul from his printing press. The more he yelled the more the Adams administration responded. The Sedition Act, supposedly created to silence the Aurora, came before Congress and passed in 1789. On top of that the the Alien Bill also passed, which enabled the president to deport any illegal alien without trial. Bache argued the unconstitutionality of both Acts. The inevitable arrest came soon after. Bache posted bail for trial for indictment under the Sedition Act. The yellow fever epidemic of the same year altered the proceedings. Other arrests and trials of newspaper editors continued. Many were convicted, spent time in prison, and paid heavy fines.<br /><br />Part Two of the book goes back in time to before the American Revolution. This section will raise the most eyebrows. It begins with an accusation that George Washington started the French Indian War of 1756. The section goes on to argue that Washington bungled the Revolutionary war so badly that Benjamin Franklin had to go to France and beg for help. Surprising letters from Washington's Generals and other government officials dot the entire section. Other revelations include Alexander Hamilton's avowal that monarchy best suits the new constitution's checks and balances, Adams' ideas behind a two house legislature, Benjamin Franklin's support of a unicameral legislature, and the alleged flouting of the French Treaty of 1778 under the Washington administration. Washington in particular fares badly in this section.<br /><br />The Third and final section returns to 1798. William Duane now heads up the Aurora (you can guess what happened). He continues the fight against the Adams administration's policies, particularly in the critical election year of 1800. The government arrests Duane under the Sedition Act, and even the United States Senate arrests Duane for \\"breach of privilege\\". Duane spends much of this section in hiding. This section also sheds some light on the origins of the Second Amendment concerning the subject of standing armies. Much, much more gets coverage in this section. Far too much to summarize here, but the election of 1800 (Adams vs. Jefferson) receives more than ample coverage.<br /><br />Throughout, the reader gets more perspectives than just the Aurora's. The Federalists (Adams' party) also get plenty of space. Numerous passages from the Gazette of the United States and Porcupine's Gazette (both Federalist papers of Philadelphia) provide vitriolic responses to Bache's and Duane's Democratic-Republican claims. Candor was not something practiced by the press of the time. Articles sometimes resulted in personal assaults on editors with opposing papers cheering on the abusers. Rough times indeed.<br /><br />Though the book provides many perspectives, the book mainly argues that Bache and Duane's Aurora saved the United States from monarchy (even Thomas Jefferson made this claim in 1823), and that freedom of the press provided the means. The book takes a decidedly anti-Federalist stance.<br /><br />Engaging and powerful, this book will provide at least another perspective on the founding of the United States and its major personalities. It accomplishes this mostly through excerpts from newspapers, The Annals of Congress, and personal letters of the time (the book contains over 2000 direct citations). At times it feels close to time travel. A long and arduous but ultimately extremely rewarding read.o house legislature, Benjamin Franklin's support of a unicameral legislature, and the alleged flouting of the French Treaty of 1778 under the Washington administration.

Most people probably think Beowulf is still read merely because it's old. Well, it is old. Wow it's old. Hoary and whiskery old. Best estimates place the composition somewhere between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D. One can speak in terms of millenia when speaking of Beowulf. Though it's old - have I mentioned that it's old - age is definitely not the sole, or even the best, reason for reading the poem. Flinging oneself into Beowulf is almost like flinging oneself into another language (if one wants to argue that Old English may as well be another language, then there you go). Simply speaking, Beowulf is still read because it is a poetic masterpiece. It's not read because the monsters go \\"boo\\" or because it's considered the prequel to \\"The Lord of The Rings\\"; it's read for the impact of its language and the themes that it explores. Of course the poem can be read for enjoyment on the level of an adventure tale. There are monsters, and they're scary, gruesome, and mean; there are also swords, gore, carnage, death, heroes, more swords, myth, partying, a vengeful mother monster, a fire-breathing dragon, and more swords. The Beowulf poet wove a good tale. Some parts spew drama. When Beowulf seeks out Grendel's mother to kill her in vengeance for terrorizing the town, he must submerge himself in a pool of horrid things, holding his breath for the best part of a day. When he finds her his ancient sword fails him. A claustrophobic scene ensues that hydrophobes should skip. Nonetheless, a cursory surface reading obscures the rich interwoven text and meanings that peek just under the surface of what seems to be - to a modern reader, at least - a heroic adventure tale.<br /><br /> Just what the poem is about remains somewhat controversial. The incredible essays included in this Norton Critical Edition bring the poem, its history, and its controversies to life. J.R.R. Tolkien's famous and groundbreaking critique of Beowulf heads up the critical section. Also included are analyses of the structure of the poem(is it analogous to interwoven tapestries and designs of the Anglo-Saxons?), its religious tone (is it Pagan or Christian or both?), is it critical of the heroic life (does heroism lead to ruin), is it a statement on the impermanence of greatness? Was Beowulf deified? There's so much to munch on that a list of questions, controversies, and potential resolutions would be exhausting and inevitably incomplete. Leave it to say that the section of criticism allows one to read Beowulf at a higher level and discover just why this old thing is still around.<br /><br /> The translation by 1995 Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney reads wonderfully. No parallel Old English text is included. Heaney's introducton is amazing. It points out salient sections of the poem where the impact of the text is greatest. Heaney directs the reader to Beowulf's funeral where a Geat woman wails and mourns not only the passing of Beowulf but the impending destruction of her culture by foreign invaders now that their defending hero is gone. Heaney's introduction should be read by all Beowulf readers.<br /><br /> Also included are discussions about the archeology of Beowulf. Photos of artifacts and sites provide imagery for the setting of the poem. The boar-crested helmets are worth the price alone.<br /><br /> Beowulf is worth reading. It can be read on many levels: on the level of poetic analysis, historical analysis, philological analysys, as a monster tale, as one of the oldest poems in the english language, or for enjoyment. Big imposing degrees are not required (though admittedly some of the criticism can get heady and academic; this is not a beginner's guide or \\"Beowulf for Morons\\"). Open up.

What exactly does it? The art work? It's great - the part ultra-real and part ultra-cartoon style gives the entire package credence while also nurturing fantasy and surrealism. The story? It's also great - part fantasy parody part adventure ala Crusoe part disturbing evil cult part ridiculous somehow all comes together in a coherent whole. How can a comic have a group of thickly-outlined blobs (Fone-Bone, Phoney-Bone, Smiley bone) that exude entirely different personality traits, a very realistically drawn beautiful woman who becomes the love interest of one of the blobs (Thorn, who Fone falls for), a tough as nails grandma who knows how to fight giant rat creatures and race cows, a group of gangly and stupid rat creatures who are led by even bigger rats and ultimately a creepy hooded creature, a large red dragon with a bizarre sense of humor, and resolve into an amazing and mesmerizing story that any human of almost any age can appreciate? Seems impossible, but here it is!<br /><br /> Volume One begins with the blobs' (Fone, Phoney, Smiley) exile from Boneville. Locusts separate them somehow onto vastly different paths. The story takes some twists and turns but is ultimately about the trio reuniting and finding their way back to Boneville (where a mob apparently awaits them). On the way Fone-Bone meets Ted the bug (and his big big big brother), some rat creatures (who try to eat him, but have issues), Thorn (a beautiful woman who Fone goes gaa gaa over), and Grandma. apparently Phoney Bone has done something that has attracted the &quot;hooded one's&quot; attention, and he has rat creatures (big hairy things with mawfuls of fangs) on patrol. The volume ends with the impending cow races, which Phoney and Smiley plan to fix, to the fortunes of both. Fone-Bone also attracts the attention of the Red Dragon, but for what reason is not answered in volume one.<br /><br /> The interplay of the characters and the artwork make this a great comic book read. It's very hard to put down once started. Also, it's very funny, but not at the expense of plot or character. Great all around.k make this a great comic book read.

It's bizarre that Yoda the Jedi master actually spouted some basic Buddhist wisdom: &quot;...always dreaming of the future, never his mind on WHERE HE WAS! Humph! WHAT HE WAS DOING!&quot; Those words sum up the idea of living in the present moment that is one of the fundamental teachings of Buddhism. This book presents small sayings (or &quot;gathas&quot;) that can be used to allay a distraction and get back into the present moment. There are verses for opening a window, looking in the mirror, using the toilet, getting dressed, lighting a candle, sweeping, eating, walking, gardening, taking out the garbage, using the telephone, and even watching television. All gathas emphasize the interconnectedness of things, and living in the present moment: &quot;We can be very happy just by being aware of what is in front of us.&quot; Themes of justice and injustice also permeate the section on food. This is a very good small, readable and comprehensible collection of Buddhist wisdom. Newcomers may have a little trouble, but the text is not very difficult, and unknown terms can be easily looked up. Buddhism incorporates very underrated perspectives and lifestyles that can reduce stress, conquer anger, and give meaning to daily existence.	2004-07-15

C'est manifique!\\" and multitudes of roses gloriously wafting down from the expensive seats in the balcony are justified. This book made Rushdie a star. Rushdie who? Isn't he the guy who wrote that bizarre quasi-sci-fi novel about some birdguy? Yes, he is. And five years following that dabble (entitled \\"Grimus\\" which, to steal Hume's thunder, \\"fell deadborn from the press\\") Rushdie sprung some new fantastic oil reserve of novel writing and produced this utter gem. What a difference a mere five years can make!<br />This is a thick book. It's a very thick book. Thick with meaning. Thick with stories. Is it about time? Sure. Is it about family? Yup. Is it a political book? Well, sorta. Is it about the vicissitudes of memory and history? Probably, yes, that sounds good. Is it about India? Oh, yup. A lot of India in it, sure sure. Its bulk is impossible to summarize to any degree of fairness. Its bulk in meaning is nearly incomprehensible. Still, it all comes down to the narrator: Saleem Sinai, who, equipped with numerous nicknames and adoptive parents, is pummelled and dragged and drained through India's independence. Having been born at the very stroke of midnight (or was that his rival, born in the same room, who was the real son of Saleem's unsuspecting first set of \\"parents\\") on the cusp and lip of India's independence, Saleem later finds himself, and 1001 other children (you guessed it, the \\"Children of Midnight\\"), imbued with magical powers beyond belief. The magic of India's independence from Britain shoots forth wonders. Of course the government under Indira Gandhi isn't too happy about this, and Saleem finds himself in a very bad sort of pickle later on. These scenes make up some of the more disturbing and violent chapters (and Rushdie was accused by some of being too hard on the Indira r&eacute;gime). Cover your eyes! Plug your ears!<br />This is historical fiction at its best. There's much to learn about the history of India in these pages of pulp. Some familiar names will pounce out from the ink: Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi (no blood relation to the Mahatma; she was assassinated in 1984, four years after this book was published), Morarji Desai, Lord Viceroy Mountbatten, etc., etc., the names and history they encompass pile up page after page. Saleem and his family are also victims (very unfortunate ones) of the partition of India (into India, Pakistan, and soon after Bangladesh). This event still holds the record for most people moved from one place to another at one time: 14 million people (with about 1 million dead). Then war war war, more war war, and a state of Emergency, war war. Saleem is buffetted through it all, as countless millions were. The novel brings out the complexity and bulk of modern independent India through the voice of Saleem. Make some room in your brain for Rushdie's \\"many headed monsters\\".<br />One of the best scenes is \\"the perforated sheet\\" in which a doctor, Saleem's Grandfather, is only allowed to examine a Muslim woman through a hole in a large sheet. One part at a time, no more, no less. One day he looks through the hole and sees a...<br />Book three is a wild ride which will likely evoke the response \\"how did Saleem get here?\\" This book is Saleem's \\"rebirth\\" ending with the \\"Abracadabra\\" that changes everything; as book two is about Saleem's birth and childhood, and book one attempts to sum up the events leading up to Saleem's birth (the perforated sheet will haunt).<br />Is Saleem an honest narrator, though? Or does he lie through his big teeth (and much bigger and talented nose)? This is one of the many tensions that rips through the novel, and questions and examines biography as well as history. Saleem only admits to lying once.<br />The novel has some debts also. It owes a big one to \\"Tristram Shandy\\" written by Lawrence Sterne in the 18th century, in which an autobiographer attempts to write his life and keeps getting mired in digressions. Rushdie takes the best elements of this brilliantly bizarre book and meshes it into his own story of Saleem. Rushdie himself has acknowledged the influence of Sterne. Also, some have called this novel \\"India's 'Tim Drum'\\" with its parallel stories of nations with growing pains siphoned through single characters. Regardless of influence, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is an amazing novel rich with meaning, detail, humor, love, tragedy, childhood, family, philosophy, religion, sibling rivarly, and people people people people people people burgeoning out through the lines of text like on a crowded Mumbai street. There are, in short, people everywhere.<br />This book is worth the effort. It may take a little more effort than expected. It's huge, it's complex, it's part history part fantasy. What it attempts to do, in a very human way, is posit meaning to events and lives and their very multifarious interpretations. It can all be found in cleverly labeled pickle jars.

US	52862047	R40O3QWIKLAEY	0415248000	692729451	On the Meaning of Life (Thinking in Action)	Books	4	22	27	N	Y	One stab at "the meaning of it all"...	Say the word \\"philosophy\\" and most people conjure up images of old dusty sages leaning on Corinthian columns and rhapsodizing about \\"the meaning of it all\\". That's the 'romantic' view (if it can be called that). Anyone who has spent time in the philosophy departments of academic institutions knows better. You won't see any togas, and few, if any, people discussing \\"life philosophy\\" or \\"the meaning of life\\". Perhaps a course on ethics might include a section on \\"the value of life\\" or on \\"leading an ethical life\\", but probably not on \\"the meaning of life.\\" Asking a career-minded philosophy professor \\"so when do we get to 'the meaning of it all?'\\" will likely yield a brusque lecture on the harsh, Hobbesian realities of academia, or at least a blank stare. Of course questions and issues concerning \\"the meaning of life\\" infuse philosophic discourse of all kinds, but not in a blatantly obvious way. Academia can only focus on minute details of such tidal wave issues. Ater all, analytic epistemology still hasn't explained satisfactorily how or why we know what we know (and who knows if it ever will or can), much less why \\"we're here\\".<br />Regardless of everything above, this book takes on the intimidating topic of \\"the meaning of it all\\". It does so in about 100 pages, so the issue of scope creeps in. How could anyone decide what to  include or exclude from such a discussion? Not to mention how anyone could even conceive of covering \\"the meaning of it all\\" in this amount of space. Taking this into account, the author does a good job of keeping the discussion focused and forming an argument around \\"the meaning of it all\\". Of course anyone could querulously quibble the details of this book to dust. Many doubtless have and will. Getting caught up in the copious minutiae of the book will only lead to frustration and stalemate. The overreaching argument of the book provides most of the rewards here, not the nitpicky details.The book divides the issue into three sections. Each one argues relatively simple points.<br />Following a very appropriate citation from \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy\\" that inaugurates the first section, the author points out that even the heady and militantly empirical Logical Positivists of the early twentieth century could not obliterate \\"the question that won't go away\\". Modern Science has not helped by depicting the universe as a cold, barren place devoid of any meaning above mathematical interpretations. Does religion offer any hope? Not on the surface, since grand figures such as Nietzsche have deconstructed it intellectually almost beyond the point of value. Nietzsche's concepts of the \\"Death of God\\" and the \\"will to power\\" get subsumed under the same arrogant mistake of Protagoras' proclamation that \\"Man is the measure of all things\\". The author concludes that we cannot create our own values, which begs the question, in the face of this, of what meaningfulness itself implies. After discussing why Nazi torturers could not have meaningful lives, the author concludes the section by saying that meaningful activities are \\"achievement-oriented\\", but not in a selfish sense. Values must ultimately have a character of interconnectedness to posit meaning to their subjects.<br />The second section presents the familiar argument between science and religion. The author accuses both sides of gross misunderstandings, and concludes that nothing in the scientific outlook necessarily precludes anything in the religious outlook, and vice versa. The two can coexist without great difficulty, meaning that no good reason exists as to why scientists cannot be spiritual without contradiction. Of course science neither proves nor disproves a \\"spiritual realm\\", and the author uses this fact as a jumping off point to the third section.<br />The last section focuses on spirituality as the way to \\"the meaning of it all\\". The author cautiously separates spirituality from any specific religious doctrines. He ultimately blames the doctrines for the alienation many feel towards religion and spirituality in general. Borrowing Pascal's wager and the benefits that a spritual outlook can provide, the book's argument turns to a plea that rational and vulnerable human beings require a spiritual dimension to their lives to survive. Nothing unbeliveably relevatory or new comes from the text, but that shouldn't elicit surprise. The author says that religions from time immemorial have communicated this same message, but warns us not to sweep this message hastily under the carpet of modern science.<br />Many opportunities for disagreement inevitably present themselves throughout this argument. Too many to list. In the end, the author has taken a vastly huge subject and put it through a filter that can accommodate the open minded amongst theists and atheists. Readers on the extreme of either side may find much to provoke thier ire. The book treads dangerous waters in places, but the conclusion encompasses the spirituality at the foundation of all religions - and arguably at the base of science - the wonder and mystery of existence.doctrines for the alienation many feel towards religion and spirituality in general.

Most of his work is for adults (a lot of his work was printed in Playboy) and includes obscenities, nudity, and adult humor. This book has all three in droves. What makes Kliban special is his ability to utilize adult humor in a non-gratuitous way. It's not just \\"dirty humor\\" for the sake of it, typically the joke calls for \\"something inappropriate\\". Consequently, don't look for the politically correct or for comforting status-quo affirming jokes here. One of the salient examples of this (that happens to be quotable) involves two people who look like hippies confronting a leathery man in an alley. The man holds a handful of pills out to the leathery man and says \\"Hey brother, like we feel awful about how the white man ripped off your land, so we want you to have these dangerous drugs.\\" There's more than humor going on here. Expect the profound along with the ridiculous when reading Kliban. This book also includes: \\"Barf Bold, A Decorative Typeface\\", \\"Better Living Through Plywood #66 and #75\\", \\"Fecal Matter Burgers\\", \\"Inside a Modern Balloon\\", \\"I go for a man in a thick suit\\", \\"King Malcom IV was hamstered on the steps of Pewksbury Cathedral, June 11, 1058\\", \\"What's good for business is good for America\\", \\"Brassiere full of Nickels\\" and loads more indescribable and unquotable toons. Not to mention that very few of Kliban's books remain in print for some incomprehensible reason. So grab them while you can. This one is still readily available. Hopefully that won't change.	2004-06-18

Thich Nhat Hanh recently spoke to the United States Congress about peace, violence, compassion, and listening. He suggested that members of Congress can find both inner and universal peace through walking meditation, or mindful walking. This tiny book serves as an introduction to this practice. Each page represents an idea, and the first page proclaims &quot;Anyone can do it.&quot; Reading on, the book reveals the true simplicity of walking meditation, and validates the claim that &quot;anyone can do it.&quot; Controlling one's breath is not the goal, but being aware of one's breath, being aware of the earth and one's feet against it. The book explains how to accomplish this in incredibly easy to understand language. Short stories about the Buddah and Thich Nhat Hanh's experiences with walking meditation, as well as many photos, punctuate the lessons. The book also suggests practical applications for walking meditation: dealing with anger, panic, and helping to find solutions to immediate problems. A great introduction to meditation and the thought of Thich Nhat Hahn.	2004-06-14

Beginning Flash animators will probably find no better starting place than this book. It includes just about everything the neophyte animator needs for a good start. The book traces the evolution of a Flash cartoon from idea to actuality, with a bonus chapter on publishing to the internet and the inevitable issues that arise at that phase. Coming up with a story can stall the most stalwart animator, and the first chapter is dedicated to this brain bulging dilemma. There may be nothing more important for a successful cartoon than starting out with and ultimately following a plan, and the book reiterates this idea almost ad nauseum - but for good reason. A script can easily translate to a storyboard, which will slowly morph into the final product. Plans will only save time and frustration in the end (a very hard learned lesson that can leave permanent damage). Many beginners may leap right into Flash with an abstract or incomplete idea thinking &quot;I'll get the ending eventually, now let's get to drawing!&quot; (I've never done this, no way, not me, no no...) A toon abandoned from frustration typically results. The authors do a great job of driving this home (so don't skip the first chapter). A great introduction to Flash's drawing tools follows the story line chapter (a subject that could fill an entire book). Discussions concerning style permeate the chapter (e.g., advantages of the brush tool over the pencil tool, etc. - readers make the choice in the end depending on personal preference). A surprising discussion on Art Direction follows. Beginning animators probably grossly underestimate the importance of mapping out characters for consistency, composition with color and space, and ease of animation (i.e., don't create characters with multitudinous moving parts and hard to animate elements). I did. Next, the book outlines the basics of storyboarding and some basic concepts of cinematography (e.g., establishing eyelines, camera positioning, etc). The authors stress the importance of making an animatic (basically a rough draft for an animation that typically involves animating the storyboard) for a toon. This probably comes down to personal preference as well (I've never made an animatic, but these guys do have massive and impressive experience). The most important chapter, &quot;Animation Principles&quot;, provides the basic theoretical foundation for what makes a toon tick. The inexperienced will find vital principles here: squash and stretch, staggering, depicting weight, anticipation, cycles, following through, and animating acting. All animators should have these concepts down to an almost second-nature degree. Everyone who reads this book should also supplement it with another book on animation principles (the authors provide a short list of possible titles). This information will improve a toon's quality and professionalism exponentially. Of course the authors eventually discuss animating using Flash, but not in detail until chapter eight. They put great weight on theory, as they should. It will pay off in droves in the end. The authors themselves say &quot;you could learn in a sentence something that has taken other Flash animators weeks and months of toil to discover, by which we mean ourselves of course!&quot; Having learned a lot of things the hard way myself (this book was no where to be found when I began animating with Flash 4 some years back), I support this advice with great weight. Heed it. Read before animating for the first time. In fact, read this book before animating for the first time. As a bonus, the authors construct an actual toon throughout the book to emphasize the priciples discussed. This also provides some hands-on experience with Flash.<br />The book includes numerous typos and a few bizarre references (e.g. chapter eight says &quot;You have probably heard of the animation term 'tweening'&quot;; yes, because chapter five has already discussed it). These in no way detract from the discussion. Overall the book flows in an extremely readable way. Any and all Flash animation beginners should read it cover to cover.verall the book flows in an extremely readable way. Any and all Flash animation beginners should read it cover to cover.	2004-06-14

The \\"Muffin Fiend\\" must be stopped! Mozart happily accepts the challenge, claiming that \\"After composing great works of music, solving mysteries is my favorite activity.\\" When he asks Constanze to bring some refreshments she informs him that there is not a muffin to be had in all of Vienna. \\"Now I see why you are so anxious to stop this monster!\\" Mozart exclaims. The story continues as the crime fighting duo visit the Municipal Muffin Bakery of Vienna (the \\"Weinstadtsmunicipalisches Bakerei\\"), the Wienerwald (Vienna Woods), and ultimately the Muffin Fiend himself. Mozart suspects that the fiend is \\"not of this world\\", but what happened to all of those muffins? Mozart uses his knowledge of Viennese jiujitsu to help apprehend the fiend (well, why not?), and ultimately to solve Vienna's horrific muffin problem. Illustrations that look right off the screen of an old Mac Classic computer accompany the text. It's anyone's guess what the publisher thought of these. Experimental? Whimsical? Innovative (the book was published in 1986)? Though not technically impressive now (the intention was surely not technical prowess), the drawings add boatloads of character to the story. Pinkwater somehow manages to siphon humor and personality from the scrawled and heavily pixellated lines. The effect succeeds brilliantly. Adults and kids alike will enjoy this bizarre tale of almost pure nonsense.	2004-06-13

Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes seems to be one of the last of the great newspaper strip panel comics. It's hilarious while also being insightful, poignant, and bitingly satirical. As most readers know, since Watterson has written it elsewhere, Calvin is named after John Calvin &quot;a sixteenth century theologian who beleived in predestination&quot;. Hobbes also has a famous historical namesake in Thomas Hobbes, the seventeeth century author of &quot;Leviathan&quot; whose most famous saying is that life in a state of nature would be &quot;Nasty, brutish, and short&quot;. From such a foundation, readers can expect more than a wacky strip full of slapstick, puns and sitcom-type pet or baby humor. There is much more, because Calvin and Hobbes, like all of the great comic strips, has depth. Reading just a handful of strips reveals this.<br />This collection from 1994 includes a great satire on conceptual art (Calvin tries to sell Hobbes a landscape in a Sunday strip); a great satire on corporate philosophy (Calvin ends up telling his mother that he needs to be subsidized); Hobbes sends Calvin anonymous insults in the mail (&quot;Most people have secret admirers, you have a secret detractor&quot;); &quot;Stupendous Man&quot; invades Calvin's class to take an exam in Calvin's place (he still flunks); one of the best is a single panel strip in which Calvin asks his parents &quot;What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?&quot;; There are also loads of Watterson's great Sunday strips. Watterson is definitely one of the last cartoonist artists that fully appreciated the boundaries (or lack of them) of the color Sunday strip. Calvin's imagined dinosaurs, aliens, parodies of &quot;Judge Parker&quot; type strips, and multicolor tiger battles are amazing works of cartoon art. It's difficult to find anything that even comes close on today's incredibly shrinking Sunday comics page.<br />Bill Watterson remains heavily elusive. What has he been doing since he voluntarily quit Calvin and Hobbes? Internet searches (at least cursory ones) don't elucidate much (one mentions that he is an intensely private individual - no doubt). Hopefully he's planning another amazing strip. Whether we hear from him again or not, in the end, we can be happy that he took up cartoonist's pen and graced the newspapers with at least one more great strip.e he voluntarily quit Calvin and Hobbes?

US	52862047	R2K8SVPFRGAOFP	0316332976	917118182	Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley	Books	5	193	202	N	N	A poingant, depressing, and insightful look at Elvis...	First and foremost, this is a depressing book. There is a warning in the author's note that the book is about a tragedy, and this is an understatement. Elvis Presely's &quot;fall&quot; was a hard and bitter one. This book outlines events starting in 1960 up to Presely's death in 1977. Things start out looking pretty good for Elvis as he leaves the army and begins his career almost anew, but as the 1970s emerge, things start to cloud over, and the book follows the downward spiraling vortex that Presley and his somewhat bizarre and almost constantly fluctuating entourage followed up to the end. Along the way, Guralnick allows readers to draw their own conclusions about Presley. Mostly the book outlines details of certain events - sometimes so detailed one wonders if Guralnick was there himself - interspersed with commentary from people who lived through these same events. It is not an uplifting read. One gets the impression that Presley's fame isolated him from pretty much the human race, made him untouchable (reprisals were feared by anyone is his immediate &quot;gang&quot;, and it didn't help matters that most of them were on his payroll) and ultimately put him beyond the help of his own family and the people who he thought were his friends. Presely's fame turns horrendously destructive in the 1970s, and some of the stories and anecdotes may make the sensitive reader wince. Some of the stories are just downright strange: Presley's religious enlightenment from seeing an image in the clouds of the face of Stalin turn into the face of Jesus; Presley's determination to secure himself a position of Narcotics officer from President Nixon; the pranks Preseley and his retinue play on each other, on audiences, and on themselves; the fact that, as record sales declined, Presely's revenue actually increased. Other anecdotes have a more disturbing undertow: Presley's manipulation and abject objectification of the women in his life, and the fact that many of them kept coming back even after being brusquely brushed off; Presley's fascination with guns, and his sometime not so comforting habit of pointing them at people when angry; Presely's wild, erratic, and irresponsible spending; Presley's inability to take advice from his wife, girlfriends, business manager, and even his own father on dire personal matters (e.g., his finances, his marriage, his health). It is a tragedy to read about someone who both cared about people but also put himself above others in a way that put him beyond their help or aid.<br />The figure of &quot;the Colonel&quot; lurks behind the entire story. He has Presley's business needs in mind, and, due to his business acumen, makes Presley (and himself) multi-millionaires beyond imagination. It's amazing to read how the Colonel is able to make more and more money from Movie studios, even as movies starring Presley are on a sharp decline in revenue and popularity. The whole story is mind boggling. In the end, the Colonel thought he was taking care of Elvis in the best way he knew how, but insatiable greed and insular attention to the bottom line and almost nothing else probably hurt Presley more than it helped him in the long run. Guralnick does not say this anywhere in the book. Again, the reader must draw moral conclusions based on the evidence. Guralnick does not moralize apart from calling the story a tragedy, and this makes this biography doubly interesting, as different readers will likely draw different conclusions based on their own interpretations of the delineated events. Who is to blame in the end? Is it fair to blame one or a few people? Is it fair to blame Presley? These questions are not answered (as they shouldn't be) but much food for thought is presented. As usual in life, the answer is far more complicated than mere finger pointing can accommodate. Guralnick handles this subject with eloquence and a distance that pull the reader in and allow for reflection upon what happened. This is not the usual shoddy rock biography that typically clutters the &quot;Music&quot; section of bookstores. This is a story to sink one's cognitive teeth into and reflect upon. Warning: this book will make you think; it will make you moralize; it will make you angry and frustrated at what happened, and it will make you ask &quot;Why?&quot; Regardless if you are an Elvis Presley fan or not (I'm really not; I was very young when Presley passed on) this is a book worth reading. It is a thick book, but a quick read (keep your dictionary handy nonetheless). Once you're in fifty pages or so, you'll probably find yourself stuck on it.dy rock biography that typically clutters the &quot;Music&quot; section of bookstores.

His books suck you in and don't let go until the final word (and that final word always seems to include a touch of sadness that the novel is over). This is one of Calvino's earlier works, written in 1957, the same year he left the communist party (his reason is summed up in: &quot;my decision to resign as a member of the party is founded on the fact that my discrepancies with those of the party have become an obstacle to whatever form of political participation I could undertake&quot;). &quot;The Baron in the Trees&quot; does include some passages about disappointed political ideals (e.g., about the French Revolution), but the book touches on far too many topics to reduce it to a mere &quot;political&quot; novel.<br />The story begins, as the first line of the novel tells us, on the fifteenth of June, 1767. Cosimo Piovasco di Rond&ograve; is a member of a family whose father has sights on climbing the aristocratic ladder. In the very first chapter there is a family scuffle, during dinner, which results in Cosimo going into the trees and vowing never to come down (&quot;And he kept his word&quot; Cosimo's brother, who narrates the story, states). Cosimo then resigns himself to a life in the trees. After some initial mishaps (dealing with rain, bathing, food, etc), he proves himself very adaptable to living off the ground. Human adaptability seems to be at the back of the story (along with many other things); his family and town almost grow accustomed to Cosimo's darting amongst the branches. Cosimo even makes a name for himself &quot;up in the trees&quot; (Voltaire asks about him, and Napolean insists on meeting him). Of course the big question that comes from this action, in the very opening of the novel, is why did Cosimo go up into the trees? Why didn't he simply run away? One possible answer is that he wanted to make an example of himself. Living in the trees (especially in the 18th century) would likely make one into a spectacle. Running away wouldn't make as strong of a point, and would sever ties to his family which Cosimo does not want to do (this becomes more obvious as the novel moves on). And why does he stay in the trees? One possible answer is that which his brother gives to Voltaire: &quot;My brother considers that anyone who wants to see the earth properly must keep himself at a necessary distance from it.&quot; Another possibility is, close to the novel's end, Cosimo is speaking with a Russian officer, who says, right after some members of his unit present him with the severed heads of some hussars, &quot;You see.. War... For years now I've been dealing as best I can with a thing that in itself is appalling; war... and all this for ideals which I shall never, perhaps, be able to fully explain to myself...&quot; Cosimo answers in like: &quot;I too have lived many years for ideals which I would never be able to explain to myself; but I do something entirely good. I live on trees.&quot; Rambunctous and impetuous youth led Cosimo into the trees (he was only twelve when he took to the branches), but his ideals, once established, kept him there the rest of his life. All of us make descions in our youth that we either follow through with or abandon. Cosimo never abandoned his decision, for good or ill.<br />The novel reads like an adventure in places (e.g., when the feared, or imaginary, &quot;Gian dei Brughi&quot; is terrorizing the countryside, but evetually becomes addicted to novels - which in and of itself makes for a hilarious few chapters - Cosimo is there for almost every move); in other places it reads like a heartbreaking love story (e.g., Cosimo's nearly lifelong affair with Viola, which becomes so intense it's almost painful to read). A lot of action goes on in the trees, and the reader will likely not conclude that Cosimo has &quot;missed something&quot; as a result of his decision. Overall the novel is so readable that it's hard to put down (it could probably be completed in one long sitting). It has that mix of reality and fantasy that Calvino is famous for (it's easy to find references to Calvino as &quot;one of the world's best fabulists&quot;). Like other Calvino it's funny (Cosimo's sister serves bizarre arrangements of food to the family), heartbreaking (did Cosimo find true love in the trees or did he fail miserably?), poignant (he finds a great comrade in a small daschund he names &quot;Ottimo Massimo&quot; but the dog ultimately belongs to someone else), and a great read.

The greatest comic ever published is getting its due thanks to this series (taken over from the now defunct Eclipse series). Once again the book is crammed with great Krazy Kat full page strips (keeping in step with the series previous three volumes). Comics were at one time far more complex, as a simple head poke into this book will reveal. These aren't your average four panel &quot;I hate Mondays&quot; gag strips. These involve reading, not glancing. Herriman was a master at his trade, and dialects, puns, non-sequiturs, nonsense, changing backgrounds, slapstick, and poignancy pervade every page. There's nothing like this on the incredibly shrinking comics page of today.<br />If you've never read Krazy Kat, here's some background: Krazy is a Kat (yes, with a &quot;K&quot;, that's very important); Ignatz is a mouse; Offica Pupp is a dog (who also happens to be a cop). These three folks live in Cocino County, where Ignatz fulfills his greatest desire of flinging bricks at Krazy Kat's head. It's not so simple as &quot;BANG!! HAHAHA!&quot; Krazy LOVES Ignatz (pines for him) and since Ignatz only showers attention on Krazy in the form of a brick, Krazy has come to interpret this as an act of love. If you see a little heart rising from Krazy's head after Ignatz &quot;beans&quot; Krazy's head, this is why. Three is of course more fun, and Offica Pupp makes the triangle complete. Offisa Pupp has something for Krazy (though it's not as obvious as the other trist). Consequently, Offisa Pupp detests Ignatz for throwing bricks at Krazy. Ignatz is often seen being dragged off to jail protesting his innocence while Krazy rhapsodizes about his &quot;'lil dahlink!&quot; If this doesn't sound like good reading to you, then you obviously haven't read the strip. Give it at least a few chances; it takes some time to sink in. It's easier to experience than to explain. You can't read this strip vicariously.<br />This installment has an amazing bonus - a boatload of Krazy Kat daily strips from 1931. Previous volumes have included interesting miscellany from the past (pictures of an Ignatz figure, or piano music for the &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; rag), but this is almost too much to ask for. Krazy Kat dailies are harder to find in print than the Sunday pages (will Fantagraphics take on the daily strips when they're through with the Sundays?), so this is a welcome bonus. And the book is HUGE! The strips are very readable, and the dailies are VERY readable. Also included is an article about George Herriman's early cartoon career, along with some of his earliest strips from 1909-1910 (Baron Mooch and Gooseberry Sprig). There are some fascinating facts here: Charles Dickens considered art to be an integral part of his novels (wouldn't know that today!), and Cocino County was actually created for an early strip of Herriman's, not for Krazy Kat.<br />May Fantagraphics march on and chronicle all that there is to chronicle of Krazy Kat.

US	52862047	R146VS4MF55D2K	0195156609	564848302	Greed: The Seven Deadly Sins (New York Public Library Lectures in Humanities)	Books	3	18	25	N	N	What is this book really about?	This is the shortest book so far in the Seven Deadly Sins series, not that any of them have been long (the longest so far has been about 150 pages, including the index). Greed is amazing in that, of its 97 pages, approximately 30 of them are notes. Some of these notes are pages long. Unfortunately, brevity in text does not translate into coherence, and this book will leave  readers wondering as to what the author was trying to accomplish, and with no very new insights into the sin of greed. The corpulent notes only detract from the main text, and many provide little or no substance to the subject matter, which is supposed to be greed.<br />There are many interesting historical snippets in this diminutive essay, and some of them relate to greed. Most of them are inserted into a vast 2000 year sweep of the evolution of the concept of &quot;sin&quot; and the effect that these events have had on western human history. St. Paul is discussed, Tertullian, Prudentius (specifcally his work called &quot;Psychomachia&quot;), Martin Luther, Alan Greenspan, Bosch, Brugel the Elder, Nietzsche, and many others are mentioned more in passing than in any detail. The ties of many of these hisorical figures to greed are tenuous or at the least not instructive as to the subject matter (i.e., Bosch painted a triptych called &quot;The Haywain&quot; and the author examines this painting as a symbol of Bosch's attitude towards greed- sure, it's interesting, but what does it really teach us about greed?). It's interesting in its own way, but isn't this supposed to be an essay about greed? Greed itself (plastered on the front of the book with a cartoony looking person clutching a large sack) seems to have been forced in and woven throughout an essay that was not originally about greed, but more about the concept of sin in general and greed was emphasized for the purpose of this series. Greed is, at one point (pg. 36) literally inserted with brackets into the text: &quot;Many of us in my line of business would also add, even emphasize, as does Professor Schimmel himself, that it is the responsibility of theistic religion, 'to translate its relevant teachings [i.e., about greed] into an idiom that speaks to modern man while respecting his skepticism about religious dogma.'&quot; The brackets are in the original text (and presumably, the author's own), and (though this is the most blatant case) give the feeling that we're not really talking about greed per se, but about a larger subject. The conclusion of the essay does not wrap up the subject of greed, but is more about Mario Donizetti's (a contemporary Italian painter) style of painting (though the painting discussed is called &quot;Avarice&quot; the discussion doesn't shed much light on the subject of greed, though it stimulates curiousity about the artist). What is the author trying to communicate through this essay? If the title had been &quot;sin&quot; or &quot;the evolution of sin&quot; or &quot;explosive moments in the last 2000 years that have changed our conception of sin&quot; the work may have made more sense. Diving into this book with the idea that greed is about to be discussed may cause some disorientation. One of the strangest lapses, which should have been put into the already burgeoning notes, is this passage from page 39 where Dickens' &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; is being discussed: &quot;Indeed, Scrooge is so completely a caricature that he is better known to thousands of school children today as a duck than as a human being.&quot; Not only is this highly debatable - which is irrelevant here, not to mention in the book itself - it adds nothing, and even detracts, from a discussion that could have circled around the entire moral of the story which relates to greed (Scrooge is known through popular culture - mainly television advertisements - to many as the embodiment of greed). Scrooge is a caricature, and that's partly why the story works, to explore the consequences that greed can have on one's own life.<br />The book also includes pictures that add little to the subject matter. Some are mentioned in the text, but without direct reference to the actual figure (i.e., the book never tells a reader to &quot;see Figure 1&quot;) so the reader must make the connection (e.g., why was the work called &quot;The Greenspan Buddah&quot; included? Greenspan is mentioned in the text, but why include this particular piece?).<br />Perhaps re-reading the essay without the notion that it is in fact about greed will yield more. It is too bad, because greed seems to surround us these days. Scandals in the financial industry and people living lives in debt for the pursuit of &quot;stuff&quot; abound. The book does not even attempt to shed light on these modern day issues (they are mentioned, but not examined in any depth).

St. Augustine is a subject that cannot be covered in 90 minutes, particularly in under 100 pages with large font. Still, this book serves as a great introduction for those who have ABSOLUTELY NO knowledge of the great philosopher.<br />If you're only looking for a brief thumbnail sketch of Augustine, or want to know the basic reasons (without details) why he's considered important, then this book will serve you well. If you're looking for details on his life, his theology, or philosophy, you'll have to look elsewhere.<br />It's important to realize that this book comes at Augustine from a philosophical perspective, not a theological or religious one. It aims to outline why he's considered important to the field of philosophy. So, if you're interested in Augustine's theology or importance from the standpoint of the Catholic church, you'll find almost nothing useful here (in fact, some of it may offend you depending upon your religious bent).<br />What does this book teach about Augustine? It can be summed up quickly: Augustine brought together the thought of Neoplatonism and Christian scripture, thus preserving philosophy for about 800 years (until Thomas Aquinas took it further in the 13th century); he had troubles with lust; his mother was overbearing; he liked to flagellate himself in his books; he had some interesting ideas how procreation worked in the Garden of Eden. There are a few more facts, but those are the main ones. It is a fun read; it's humorous in places (again, depending upon your background) and you will leave the book with an appreciation of who he was. Other considerably more bulky books will have to flesh out the inevitable nagging questions that this one will leave you with.<br />Augustine is a towering figure in western philosophy. His work presages Descartes, Kant, and others. He deserves a higher stature than he currently enjoys, but this book will only give you a tiny eency weency snippet of the reasons why.	2004-05-18

The most obvious thing to say about Salman Rushdie's first novel is this: if you have read no other Rushdie, put it down now and return to it after you have read one of his other novels.<br />Grimus only resembles Rushdie's other work in a nebulous and tenuous way. It is not as complex, rich, or engrossing to read as his later work. That said, this book is probably best left to Rushdie completists; if you want to read absolutely everything he's written, then go ahead. Otherwise, approach this book with caution: it alone does not fairly represent the Rushdie that is considered one of the best writers of the current generation.<br />Not to say that this is a bad book. By no means is it bad. It just isn't exceptional. The writing is somewhat fumbling, and even a little clumsy and overbearing in places. Rushdie has said that he found his voice while writing his second novel, &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; and Grimus reads like someone who is searching for a path or a voice, not someone who is on firm footing; this novel provides direct evidence of Rushdie's statement.<br />The bizarre story deals with immortality, created worlds, other dimensions both inner and outer, and outcasts. Flapping Eagle, or Joe-Sue, or Born-from-Dead is an Axona indian who has a lighter complexion than the rest of his people; add to this that his mother died seconds after he was born and you get an outcast. He is not easily accepted, but his sister, Bird-Dog, protects him. She also presents him with the elixir of eternal life (in the form of a yellow liquid) and she disappears mysteriously from the land of the Axona. Flapping Eagle is then exiled from his people, and wanders the world for centuries before falling through a gate in the Mediterranean that leads to &quot;Calf Island&quot; while attempting suicide (he is also in the throes of searching for his sister, Bird-Dog, who has also drank the yellow liquid, and apparently wandered off with a man named &quot;Sispy&quot;). He floats under the rocking chair of Virgil Jones, who recognizes something in Flapping Eagle, and takes him in. Flapping Eagle gets Virgil to admit that he has seen Bird Dog on Calf Island, and decides to go up Calf-Mountain, but Virgil must accompany him because of the &quot;Grimus Effect&quot;. This effect consists of a &quot;whine&quot; that pervades the mountain and, for lack of a better explanation, drives people mad who succumb to it for too long a time. At the top of Calf Mountain sits the town of &quot;K&quot;, in which live people who deal with the effect by obsessing over various things. Here Flapping Eagle and Virgil part ways: Flapping Eagle goes to an upper-class type existence and gets intimately involved with two married women, and Virgil retreats to the &quot;House of the Rising Son&quot; (a brothel). When people begin dying in the town of &quot;K&quot; (which is doubly shocking because everyone in K has tasted the yellow liquid of immortality), they turn against Flapping Eagle, and he and Virgil decide they must join forces and face Grimus, who supposedly resides at the cloud-obscured summit of Calf Mountain. This leads to the novel's climax.<br />The specter of Grimus looms cryptically in the back of the plot; is Grimus a man, a force, a monster? The answer doesn't come until the very end of the novel, where the &quot;goal&quot; of Flapping Eagle's life comes to fruition: but did he choose his own destiny or did Grimus? Philosophical issues such as immortality, free will and determinism, suicide, and death are dealt with throughout the twisty tale. It is a bizarre read, and half way through the novel readers may wonder what they've got themselves into. Sometimes the text slips from third to first person (always the first person is the voice of Flapping Eagle), but so irregularily and infrequently it's jarring each time; at best the technique is only arguably somewhat effective.<br />Some feminist critics have lashed out at Rushdie for the depiction of women in this novel. It's not hard to understand why. Most of the women characters are either prostitutes or dizzy and demented with love for a man. One example is the character of Liv, who is a black-velied beauty who uses intimacy as a tool for revenge. Many of the women in this novel all come off as somewhat hollow, weak, and one-sided characters. This adds to the second rate and unexceptional tone that pervades the entire novel. This is something Rushdie has risen above in his later work, and judging him on this issue by this book alone would be a great injustice.<br />In the end Grimus is not a bad book, but as a book by Salman Rushdie it is disappointing. It is extremely hard to believe that about five years later Rushdie would publish &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; - which is as rich and dazzling as Grimus is mediocre.is novel.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is such a book. Not only is it a great read, it says something about greed, gluttony, and the dangers of the fantastic.<br />The story is probably familiar to many (thanks to the 1971 film adaptation), but the basic plot is this: Willy Wonka, a reclusive, famous (almost Howard Huges-like) owner of the largest candy factory in the world wraps five golden tickets in candy bars and distributes them to the world. No one has been in or out of Wonka's factory in years, but these tickets allow the ticket finders access to it for one day, as well as a lifetime supply of world-famous Wonka candy. Four tickets are quickly found by families who have the money and the means to do so (one of the finder's father even stops production in his factory so that his voluminous workers can unwrap the thousands of candy bars he's purchased in hope of finding one of the tickets). This is discouraging to Charlie Bucket, who comes from a destitute family who eat mostly watery cabbage and boiled potatoes. Charlie only gets one chocolate bar a year for his birthday - his father's job screwing on the tops of toothpaste tubes doesn't bring much income. Charlie's luck changes when he finds a dollar bill in the snow (after his father loses his job in the toothpaste factory the family begins to starve, and Charlie conserves energy by walking slowly, which helps him find the dollar). Luck leads to luck, as Charlie buys two candy bars and the second one contains a golden ticket. Charlie's 95 year-old (wow!) grandfather agrees to accompany Charlie. So, Along with four other spoiled brats and their families, Charlie and Grandpa Joe tour the Wonka factory. Inside, the factory is filled with amazing things, and the spoiled brats show their worst side and also expose the dangerous side of the fantastic. A river of chocolate is great until you fall into it. Trained squirrels are great unless they mistake you for a bad nut and through you in the chute. Chewing gum that tastes and nourishes as though it were an entire three course meal is great as long as the forumla is right and doesn't turn you into a giant blueberry. Being allowed into the Wonka factory is an amazing experience unless you're a spoiled brat who needs to grab, chew, eat, or touch everything you see. In this case being a brat brings dire consequences. The reward for not being a brat is something unbelievable, but the \\"losers\\" still get a lifetime supply of candy and chocolate.<br />Fans of the film (which is mistitled \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" because Charlie is really supposed to be the hero here) will notice some great differences in the story. The famous \\"Oompa Loompa\\" song is not in the book, but they do sing, but they sing longer and more detailed songs than in the movie. One of the songs goes on about the evils of television:<br />The most important thing we've learned<br />So far as children are concerned,<br />Is never, never, NEVER let<br />Them near your television set -<br />Or better still, just don't install<br />The idiotic thing at all.<br />They do not sing \\"Oompa Oompa Ommpity Doo, I've got another problem for you\\" such as in the movie. They also give credit where credit is due: the brattiness of the kids is also blamed on the parents. So in a way the story also becomes a lesson in parenting. The Oompa Loompas sing:<br />For though she's spoiled, and dreadfully so,<br />A girl can't spoil herself, you know.<br />Alas! you needn't look so far<br />To find out who these sinners are.<br />They are (and this is very sad)<br />Her loving parents, MUM and DAD.<br />In this way the Oompa Loompas almost serve the purpose of a Greek chorus. Whenever of the brats \\"gets it\\" they sing about the tragedy and probable causes of the event. This book is a very enjoyable read for any age. If you're an adult, don't deprive yourself of great children's books such as this one. If you're a kid, don'tdeprive your parents of your great books such as this one. Make them read it. Force them to read it. You know you want to.arents of your great books such as this one. Make them read it. Force them to read it. You know you want to.	2004-05-13
US	52862047	R3NVCM5KEW6V7	156097589X	6726656	The Complete Peanuts 1950-1952 (Vol. 1)  (The Complete Peanuts)	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	HOW I HATE HIM!!!!	For those of us who experienced Peanuts in its heyday (the 1970s and 1980s) it's almost inconcievable that at one time Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and \\"the Peanuts Gang\\" were considered edgy and cutting edge; that intellectuals applauded the freshness and depth of the strip. If you're shocked at all by this notion, then David Michaelis' essay \\"The Life and Times of Charles M. Schulz\\" included in this book will be eye-popping, neuron-bending reading. Apart from arguing that Peanuts was an intellectual revelation for the comics, the piece also exposes Schulz as someone who was deeply uncomfortable with his fame, who felt \\"abnormal\\" in his role as master cartoonist, and felt that he had a responsibility towards his fan base. You will not think of Peanuts in the same light at all when you finish reading it.<br />The book overall is amazing. Every single Peanuts cartoon printed between October 1950 (when the strip debuted) and December 31st, 1952 is included. This also includes Sunday strips, which don't begin until January 1952 (they're not in color, but I'm not sure if they were originally printed in color). There's also a nice introduction by Garrison Keillor (another famous Minnesotan), and a rather lengthy and indepth interview with Schulz from 1987. Lastly, there's an index in which readers can find out which pages include strips that mention \\"crying\\" or \\"filibuster\\" or which pages include strips that Snoopy appear in, or Linus. If you're desperate to find a Peanuts strip from 1950 to 1952 in which Santa Claus in mentioned, this index will save your life. Otherwise, it's a curious addendum to a great collection of strips.<br />The strips themselves are of course the reason to buy the book in the first place, and they reveal quite a bit. Peanuts was edgy in the early days, sometimes even surreal. The kids were downright cruel and nasty to one another; even Charlie Brown had an attitude. Some of them seem to show strange glimpses of human nature at work. The fact that Schulz used kids that weren't really \\"kids\\" is how he gets away with it all. Had the strip been drawn as a group of adults it wouldn't have made it out of the inkwell. It also wouldn't have worked if the kids were really \\"kids\\" - what children use words such as \\"trite\\"; what toddlers do you know that admire Beethoven? But of course they are kids in many ways as well, but they expose the bizareness of being in the world and having to endure strange logic, motives, and emotions. It actually can be complex stuff. This side of the strip presents itself more when read in large chunks. It can also be violently slapstick (or just plain violent), absurd, and poignant all at once. There are good reasons that Peanuts is considered one of the best strips of all time.<br />From the very first strip, very familiar to fans, in October 1950 the action starts: \\"Good 'Ol Charlie Brown, yes, sir... Good 'Ol Charlie Brown... How I hate him!\\" This sets the stage for what's to come in a big way. Children (or the children/adult hybrids) seem to take immense pleasure in back-stabbing, upsetting, being unfairly judgmental, hitting, and yelling at one another. Some of the only real warm fuzzies are the Christmas strips. Of course many of the strips are just gag strips, but that's not all there is. There is depth if one looks for it.<br />In this book many characters that will rule comics (and sometimes the mainstream) are introduced: of course Charlie Brown (who morphs throughout the collection), Snoopy (he won't look familiar, and he doesn't think/talk as much as he later would; he's more of a dog comic relief here), Violet (who appears a lot early on - usually making mud pies - but she appeared less frequently as the strip's run went on), Patty (not Peppermint Patty), Shermy (I think he disappeared in later years, along with Patty), Schroeder (who goes from a baby to his final Peanuts form, loving Beethoven all the way), Lucy as a baby, and Linus as a baby. There are no adults anywhere (though apparently in the next volume there will be - what Schulz later called his \\"failed experiment\\"). There is also the first appearance of Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown - which later became a common theme of the strip.<br />Judging by its beginnings, it's not hard to see how Peanuts became a cultural phenomenon. Over the years the edge may have worn off a bit (as other comic strips began to imitate it), and such constructions as Camp Snoopy in the Mall of America and the rampant commercialism the strip went through may turn some stomachs (the \\"gang\\" sold junk food and insurance, among other things), this strip still has something. This collection will restore Peanuts to its rightful place as one of the best, if not the best, strip ever produced. Fantagraphics has already accomplished great things with its Krazy Kat reprints, and the complete Peanuts may be in a position to outdo even that.

If you're one of those people who enjoy going to art musuems, but find yourself scratching your head at the piles of plastic bones, jars of fat, or sound boxes that endlessly repeat &quot;chatter chatter chatter&quot; installed in dark rooms, this book will be of great assistance. Conceptual art is simply a different world. It's not a pretty painting or a beautiful sculpture (though &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;beautiful&quot; are relative to the extreme); it's more of a reaction to these things, a response to the notion of what art is, or a heightening and re-evaluation of the question &quot;what is art?&quot;<br />The best &quot;explanation&quot; of conceptual art in this book is by the philospher Arthur C Danto. He suggests that at some point art moved from the purely aesthetic to the purely philosophical; without a theoretical background it is very difficult to see why a Brillo box or a neon light that glows and pulsates the words &quot;Eat and Die&quot; is considered art. The &quot;art&quot; is in the concept, not necessarily in the physical work itself. Conceptual art is thus highly intellectual (usually), abstract, and typically doesn't aim for the mere appreciation of a physical object. That many of the artists mentioned in this book use concepts from philosophers like Wittgenstein doesn't refute the claim that conceptual art inhabits an almost purely mental or philosophical realm. To appreciate it, the viewer must go beyond the basic act of seeing.<br />The book begins with some introductory remarks concerning conceptual art, then discusses its origins in the work of Duchamp, Dada, and cubism. The bulk of the book concentrates on what is considered the peak of conceptual art, or the years 1966 to 1972. Apart from the artistic developments of the times discussed, political and social developments are detailed in parallel. This brings out the political side of conceptual art which many felt (and feel) is the true aim of all conceptual art. Along these lines there are some disturbing images such as the piece &quot;Q: And babies? A: and babies&quot; which is a photograph of dead bodies (adults and children) in a ditch taken during the Vietnam war. There is also an entire chapter dedicated to women and conceptual art - which contains another disturbing piece entitled &quot;rape scene&quot;, a chapter about conceptual artists using photography, and a discussion about the dissolution of the art object, and almost the artists themselves, as a &quot;progression&quot; of art in the twentieth century. A particularly fascinating discussion revolves around the debate as to whether art is or is not a commodity, and that conceptual art's attempt to remove the commodity from art was doomed to failure from the start. Parts, smaller parts, of the book discuss art in other countries. These are mostly cursory discussions, but are still interesting for their own part. The final chapter discusses conceptual art in the 1990s, and conceptual art's legacy in general.<br />For modern museum denizens there are many familiar names mentioned here in connection with conceptual art: Duchamp, Man Ray, Magritte, Warhol, Bruce Nauman, Ad Reinhardt (with his great &quot;What do YOU represent&quot; cartoon of 1945), Piero Manzoni (who literally had his own excrement canned), Claes Oldenburg, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Frank Zappa, Yoko Ono, Joseph Beuys, even Laurie Anderson, and many others far too numerous to list.<br />One of the more interesting projects discussed is Hans Haacke's &quot;Manet-PROJEKT 74&quot; in which Manet's &quot;Bunch of Asparagus&quot; of 1880 was to be displayed next to placards describing the political and economic status of the individuals that have owned the piece since its original sale. The Wallraf-Richartz museum in Cologne did not appreciate the concept and rejected it, likely due to the fact that the last placard described an individual's, one who had helped the museum acquire the Manet, known ties to the Third Reich.This is conceptual art being both political and self-referential (not to mention historically fascinating).<br />Throughout, the pictures and layout are incredible (as is typical for Phaidon). The text can get pretty thick at times when it describes some of the pieces. At other times it seems to brief, as if the author was trying to get in as much as possible. Overall the discussion is a good one and will enlighten anyone looking for guidance through the maze of bizarre objects that live in modern museums.This is conceptual art being both political and self-referential (not to mention historically fascinating).<br />Throughout, the pictures and layout are incredible (as is typical for Phaidon).

Lust is a topic about which it is very easy to accuse someone of having had too much to think. Being an inherently and inevitably illogical and rationally evasive subject, it provides mounds of frustration for intellectuals and psychologsts, who, more often than not, seem to be helplessly pounding on the head of a gargantuan behemoth. Lust's reputation, both historic and current, does not help. There is a long tradition in the West of rigid control, of not giving in and becoming a slobbering porn shop denizen. In this sense, lust has become another bad habit, like smoking or gambling, and the term \\"sexual addiction\\", with its implied hopes of convalescence, has entered the public discourse. Lust thus has been put on the naughty shelf with the nudie mags and skin flicks. To some extent, because of the inevitable correlations, sex has been put there as well, and, along with religion and politics, it has become the third most important thing that one should not discuss with others in public. Of course we do talk about it nonetheless, because lust has a power to overcome both morality and propriety. Two thousand years of Christian shame have not subverted its powers. Legal restrictions and sodomy laws seem like squealing moralzing rodents next to its lumbering bulk. The West seems incapable of acceptance on an intellectual and moral basis that lust, and what it leads to, is inexplicable from human nature. The only peace seems to come from acceptance, which of course suggests anything but peace (those who have been entangled by lust likely know this). Various reviews of this book promised a saving of lust from intolerant traditions, or what implies an intellectual acceptance of the West's most maligned pleasure. Given that, how could one not pick up and read this tiny book?<br />This book focuses on lust from a Western perspective. The space limitations (about 130 pages) most likely precluded a detailed discussion of lust from other cultural traditions, which is too bad, because there is a lot to chew on when comparing different cultures' views on the subject. Still, there is a brief mention of eastern thoughts on lust, which only provides a teaser for what could be learned from a more detailed comparison, but that must be left to other books.<br />Starting off, the author says he is taking a \\"philosophical stroll in the park\\" of the subject. That is an accurate assessment. The fifteen chapters each take on a different aspect of the topic. There is a flow of information from one to the other, but it is a casual flow, not an Aristotelian logical analysis based on predicate logic or Venn diagrams. This is a good thing.<br />Each chapter provides a glimpse into the multifarious worlds that open up when the rusty door of lust is forced from its hinges. For example, how do we know exactly what we desire when we desire something or someone? Is it simply a person's sensual body or is it something less direct, such as revenge, the fulfillment of a past sexual shafting or emotional issue? It's not always clear; there is a discussion on the nature of excess, or \\"what is too much?\\" with the inevitable mention of President Clinton (the Monica Lewinsky scandal had a decidedely medieval tone to it). The book deals with technical issues such as this.<br />Lust from a historical perspective juices many of the book's chapters. Lust has a long history as a deadly sin, and many famous philosophers and Saints have had much to say about it (the author relaxes some of the blame too often put on Saint Augustine alone). The Greeks accepted lust as something endowed in human nature, but something to keep in check. \\"Nothing in excess\\" more or less sums up the Greek moral view of lust. Then something happened when Christianity became the dominant Western morality. The \\"cult of the virgin\\" took hold, and lust was not something merely to control, but to obliterate altogether; it was tantamount to Satanic influence. The book's at a glance view of this transition is fascinating, but sadly all too brief.<br />There is optimism here as well. What the author calls a \\"Hobbesian Unity\\" (after, of course, Thomas Hobbes) may be one of the aims of lust. Could this salicious thing be pointing us towards unity and romantic love of another human being? Obviously not always, but it's a possibility. What successful relationships don't have even a trace of lust in them? It seems hard to imagine a successful union between people \\"in love\\" in which sexual desire plays absolutely no role. There are of course dangers, and the book touches on these as well: objectivity, obsession, dominance, etc. There is a brief glimpse at evolutionary psychology's point of view. In the end, the author has an optimistic tone about lust, but is as unavoidably clueless as the rest of us are on the subject. Not that he claims any special knowledge, but the book will manifest no solutions to lust's power, though it will provide new perspectives and avenues down which further research can be taken. Overall a good read that will leave one deep in thought about one's own issues with the very complicated issue of lust.

What successful relationships don't have even a trace of lust in them? It seems hard to imagine a successful union between people \\"in love\\" in which sexual desire plays absolutely no role. There are of course dangers, and the book touches on these as well: objectivity, obsession, dominance, etc. There is a brief glimpse at evolutionary psychology's point of view. In the end, the author has an optimistic tone about lust, but is as unavoidably clueless as the rest of us are on the subject. Not that he claims any special knowledge, but the book will manifest no solutions to lust's power, though it will provide new perspectives and avenues down which further research can be taken. Overall a good read that will leave one deep in thought about one's own issues with the very complicated issue of lust. After all, if you're human, you've likely succumbed to some degree.	2004-04-12

This one is not an easy find, mostly due to its current pricetag as an out of print survey of Van Vliet's paintings. If you do have some discretionary income, it's a good book to pick up. The book, dated 1987, is a collection of sixteen of Van Vliet's poems (most of which are lyrics from the Captain Beefheart albums \\"Trout Mask Replica\\", \\"Doc At The Radar Station\\" or \\"Ice Cream For Crow\\" -which makes the collection doubly valuable since the CD booklets to some of these do not include lyrics), sixteen of Van Vliet's paintings (with great titles like \\"Pig Erases Statue In Passing\\", \\"Rolled Roots Gnarled Like Rakers\\", and \\"Candle Powered Rodeo Ghosts\\" - there is also a drawing in the front of the book that doesn't seem to be referenced anywhere in the book - it looks like one of Van Vliet's), a painting and essay by A.R. Penck (the painting is of \\"Captain Beefheart\\" and the essay, presented in both German and English, is entitled \\"To Don Van Vliet\\"), and a photograph of Van Vliet in Cologne on the telephone - holding his almost trademark cigar (I haven't seen this photo reproduced elsewhere).<br />The entire book is printed in beautiful glossy paper which really evokes the colors and moods of the paintings - subconscious blotches intermixed with dream and/or nightmare shapes and imagery. Van Vliet has stated many times that his goal is to \\"turn himself inside out on canvas\\", and the paintings themselves suggest what this process must be like.<br />It's a thin book; it can be read in a single sitting; it's around 96 pages; it's not a coffee-table sized book: it's only about 9 1/2 inches high and 6 1/4 inches long; it's a paperback. Keep all of this in mind before shelling out (...) dollars for a copy. For diehard fans it will be worth every economic unit. To get an intimate glimpse of Van Vliet's art and poetry the investment is definitely worth it, especially considering that there is no readily available book dedicated to Van Vliet's art on the market at the time of this writing.his writing.	2004-04-11

The plaque is extremely weathered and greenish, and looks as if it has been reset more than once into the rock. It says that, above the rock on the hill, where the present day church now stands, is the original site of the first dwelling built in Minneapolis in 1834 by Samuel and Gideon Pond. I've walked by this historic marker for years while circling the lake, so when I came across Samuel Pond's work on the Dakota in Minnesota (including those that lived on Lake Calhoun), I had to read it.<br />Obviously, the salient thing about Lake Calhoun is the complete absence or even a tiny minute speck of evidence that it was once inhabited by Native Americans. They are simply gone without a trace. High rises and expensive homes now line the lake, and ice fishers speckle its icy surface from approximately October to February. From the viewpoint of today, it's almost impossible to believe Lake Calhoun was any different. That's only one thing that makes this book so great. It makes the reader aware of what was happening before the europeans arrived (or invaded as some people see it) in Minnesota.<br />The book was written by a missionary; Samuel Pond's sole purpose in habitating with the Dakota was to save souls. The somewhat happy and possibly unforeseen outcome of this was that Pond had to get to know these people incredibly unbelievably well to save them. So, as good missionaries will do, he literally shacked up with them. He hunted with them, observed rituals, went on long journeys with them, spoke their language fluently, and, most importantly, talked with them. This guy was there, he wasn't a journalist or a muckraker. He was literally on a mission.<br />The book, almost paradoxically, does not mention whether or not Pond was successful or not in &quot;converting&quot; or &quot;saving&quot; the Dakota. There is almost no mention whatsoever of his missionary work, so this is not a self-gratuitous work that shouts &quot;look what I did!&quot; What it is is an observance, a capturing of a people before that people completely disappeared (i.e., as they have today).<br />It is important to note that the book was not written while Pond lived with the Dakota. It was written some thirty or forty years after. Why? When Pond lived with the Dakota, there was no indication that within the next fifty years Native American culture would be more or less wiped out. As Pond observed this phenomenon, he found it best to write down his recollections of his life with the Dakota, since the culture no longer existed as it was in the 1830s. Pond wrote after what is now known as the Dakota Conflict of 1862, which radically changed the relations between whites and Dakota in the Upper Midwest, and resulted in the largest mass execution in United States History (in Mankato, Minnesota; Reconciliation Square now marks the spot where 38 Dakota were simultaneously hung by the neck for their supposed part in the events of 1862).<br />Pond is mostly very fair to the Dakota. He passionately defends them against what were the then mainstream accusations of laziness, uncleanliness, gluttony, and barbarity. Pond was overall very impressed by the Dakotas, and obviously had a lot of respect for them as a people. He is, however, not fair to the Dakota's religious practices - this is the one topic where Pond's ulterior motives really show - calling them &quot;ridiculous superstitions&quot;.<br />All in all, Pond's descriptions and retelling of events are priceless for anyone curious about Dakota life before the overwhelming influence of european settlers set in. There are so many amazing stories winding throughout this text that picking one or two out as examples would be unjust to the rest. Pond also draws parallels between the life of european settlers of the time and of the Dakota. These are always fascinating, and Pond's intent seems to be making europeans think hard about their prejudices.<br />Why this book is not more widely read or talked about I'm at a loss to explain. Perhaps the missionary twist scares people off? Whatever the reason this book is vitally important in that it attempts to capture the culture that was completely destroyed in the 19th century. It is timely, of course, in that the Dakota are often referred to as &quot;savages&quot; or &quot;heathens&quot;, but that adds a historical interest to the text, albeit a somewhat now sad one. One must prepare oneself for a 19th century read when dipping into this book. It is well worth the effort.<br />Lastly, this book was previously issued with its more historically accurate title of &quot;The Dakota or Sioux in Minnesota As They Were in 1834&quot;. Changing the title seems somewhat strange since the author intended the title to emphasize that the work focused on &quot;how they were&quot; in 1834.

Ok, first off honesty and self-debasement: I bought this work mostly because it has David Byrne's name on it. Now I feel better, and can continue.<br />There's obviously more to this book and DVD than simply &quot;David Byrne&quot; - there's a sorely needed look at just how some of the simplest and most seemingly benign aspects of our lives can inculcate us into a certain manner of being or indoctrinate us into a specific world view. We often use tools and or processes as if on auto-pilot and the nuances escape like nibbling gerbils in a shoebox. That is the basic underlying theme of this work, regardless of one's opinion of the artwork or the, what seems to be, over emphasis on a Microsoft product.<br />Byrne says as much in the book's &quot;exegesis&quot;: Microsoft Powerpoint, through the use of such make-it-as-easy-as-possible tools - &quot;wizards&quot; or &quot;auto content managers&quot; - has the ability to sink into our daily lives and affect our behavior and opinions on things if used uncautiously (really, like anything else in the world). On the flip - and far less pernicious - side, such tools can be downright fun to play with if one lets themselves go and thinks of the tool outside of its original purpose. So, again, in the &quot;exegesis&quot;, Byrne makes an assumption: Powerpoint is a means of expression much in the way that finger paints, clay, or crayons are. He assumes that Powerpoint can be utilized as an art form. In this way the software takes on a new life, and forces someone to look at it in an entirely new way. It's not just for boring business presentations anymore! Wake up, people, it's fun!!<br />All of the above is not readily apparent if one dives into the accompanying DVD tabula rasa. At first sight, one is bound to find the work frivolous and maybe even juvenille or pretentious. At the very least these pieces will probably evoke the typical question of &quot;why?&quot; The answer to this useful interrogative word is that these pieces are not meant as ends unto themselves, but as processes, as ways of evoking new ways of thinking about something most of us take for granted. By the very asking a new way of thinking can open up. So, whether or not one appreciates these pieces as works of art is probably not the point of this project. Seeing everyday things in a new and playful way is probably more on cue than any pure aesthetic or artistic endeavors.<br />I'll admit straight out that this book and DVD has influenced the way I look at Powerpoint. Being one of the few survivors of the recent Information Systems employment slaughter, I use Powerpoint frequently and witness the Powerpoint presentations of others a little too frequently. The other day I actually sat down and played with Powerpoint. It was fun, I almost hate to admit it. I sent my work to some co-workers and asked them to &quot;be ready to present on this 7am Monday morning&quot;. Of course it was all nonsense in Spanish, English, French, and Japanese complete with unconnected twirling and dissolving pictures and meaningless pulsating charts and graphs. I'm not sure what my co-workers thought of it, but I had fun.<br />There's more to this work than a glance can capture. Deep down there's mostly fun and a new perspective that can be applied to all avenues of one's mundane business life and software.are not meant as ends unto themselves, but as processes, as ways of evoking new ways of thinking about something most of us take for granted.

Today the idea of gluttony seems almost like a strange anachronism. People in the United States eat a lot, and restaurants continually meet the demand for larger and larger portions, and shamelessly wave their &quot;NOW BIGGER THAN BEFORE!&quot; banners to all who enter the doors of fast food-hood or of international restaurant chains. Gluttony almost seems accepted, if not a social norm. Eat more! Live! Unfortunately, fat is the outcome of following the rules, and our society also chastises the fat for giving into the social conditioning of &quot;MORE IS BETTER, ESPECIALLY WITH SPECIAL SAUCE!&quot; As a result, obesity and guilt are currently rampant. People with weight problems are pulled in many directions with no seeming resolution to the tension.<br />&quot;Gluttony&quot; touches on this theme and these tensions. Consumers of food are in a strange position these days. Eat to fit in, but don't eat so much that the cellulite shows, otherwise you won't fit in. One of the most interesting themes that the book does a touch and go on is the notion that those that can get away with gluttony (i.e., those with mega-metabolisms) are not looked down on but envied, but those who gain with every masticulation are shunned. The book could have developed this very fascinating idea more, but as it is, it is mentioned only briefly.<br />Most of the book is contained in the first chapter. Here, an interesting history of gluttony is demarcated. Just why is gluttony a sin, and why is it often placed at the top of the sin ladder? These questions are answered, along with some very interesting tidbits such as how Saint Francis of Assisi used to put ashes on his food to ward off the pleasure of taste, and Thomas Aquinas' &quot;weight problem&quot;. This makes up the bulk of the book. The second chapter describes some of the consequences of gluttony as seen by the Middle Ages and our own age. The weaving of the medieval idea of gluttony and the modern idea of gluttony is not an easy thing to do. There are too many differences between these ideas to really make a solid and incorrigible connection between them. The idea of gluttony today is just incredibly different from the medieval/classical view of it. This tension rides through the entire book, and sometimes the two notions just seem pasted side by side and result in a &quot;yes, okay... that was then, this is now...&quot; type of response that begs to know what the two ideas put side by side are supposed to teach us. Both are interesting in their own right, no doubt, but the book fails in connecting the two in an interesting way. Also, the final two chapters have the feeling of filler. They don't really advance the argument or the theme of gluttony very much. The last chapter, entitled, &quot;Great Moments in Gluttony&quot; is simply a collection from various works of extravagant scenes of gluttony (these scenes are memorable and fun in their own right, such as passages from Rabelais and Petronius). Lastly, there is a great collection of artworks included, some in color. Many of these works are not mentioned in the book itself, and some of the artworks mentioned in the text are not represented in the pictures. They are strangely disconnected from the text (there are no direct references in the text to the artwork, such as &quot;see folio 10&quot;).<br />Nonetheless, this is an entertaining and fun little book to read. There is much to learn about gluttony here, and much to learn about the seven deadly sins in general (since Gluttony was seen as the worst of them and thus able to lead the innocent into violation of the other deadly sins, particularly lust). It may leave one with more questions than answers, but that's to be expected from a topic as enormous as this one. It may be best to think of it as a starting point for further reading on the subject. What it will do, which is why it's worthwhile in the end, is make you think about what you eat and why you eat it.ng to do.

His work always had a philosophical side to it, and in Mr. Palomar that side almost takes over completely.<br />Mr. Palomar is the main character (in fact, one of the only characters) and the world simply befuddles him to an extent that he needs to find order and meaning in everything. His attempts are often very funny, but how they're all inevitably spoilt is even funnier. Probably the best example of this is the section entitled &quot;The Naked Bosom&quot; - Palomar tries to find a way to both not deny himself the natural pleasure of seeing a topless sunbather and not denying the naked sunbather digity and respect. His attempts cause him to pass by the sunbather so frequently that she gets up in a huff. Good intentions, bad implementation. The book circles around similar themes, but within many different contexts. Palomar looks at waves, rhapsodizes on mating turtles, examines the night sky, examines the patrons of a cheese shop, etc. Mr. Palomar is always in natural and real-life situations, but over-analyzing them to a degree almost of unreality. Though it sometimes reads like a very heady, and bordering on the pretentious, book, it's actually a very funny book about trying to find meaning in life, and the inevitable problems one will likely have in finding meaning all by oneself. It almost reads like a parody of intellectualism; of someone so thirsting for knowledge that they forget their very surroundings and paradoxically neglect themselves and others in the process. The more Palomar examines the world, the less he feels comfortable in it, and the further he seems to drift from people and society. By the end of the book, Palomar is in pretty bad shape in this regard, and the book's final sentence will either stun you or make you laugh very hard. Yes, there is a story (and arguably a plot) it's just told very unconventionally.<br />Some of the standout sections are &quot;The Naked Bosom&quot; (mentioned earlier, about the sunbather), &quot;Marble and Blood&quot; (about hidden guilt in a butcher's shop), and &quot;Serpents and Skulls&quot; (about interpreting ancient meanings). All of these are at once funny and profound. Through Palomar's search the reader gets a peek at some of the great questions and some controversial issues. How one deals with these questions and issues is something every reflective, for those fortunate enough to have time and resources for reflection, human being must wrestle with. In the end the book asks a big question: &quot;How to deal with all of this?&quot; It is doubtful that Mr. Palomar provides a good example, but it is entertaining to follow his steps through the maze of existence's puzzles.<br />The table of contents of this book are not where one would expect. They have been put to the back of the book as an index, and coded thematically and experientially. The index explains the structure of the book. I can't say I've seen this approach elsewhere, but it makes me wonder if Palomar is responsible for them - is the index part of the parody?<br />Palomar is experimental, funny, profound, unconventional, and at last entertaining and challenging to read. This pretty much sums up all of Calvino's books. He never settled on one approach or one style for too long. One never knows what they're going to get when one picks up a book by Calvino.&quot; (mentioned earlier, about the sunbather), &quot;Marble and Blood&quot; (about hidden guilt in a butcher's shop), and &quot;Serpents and Skulls&quot; (about interpreting ancient meanings).

Metaphysics often plays the role of modern science's curmudgeonly grandfather. While the relatively young discipline of science gains more and more prestige by showing us more and more of what empirical reality consists of and making larger and larger claims about what science will show us (&quot;The Mind of God&quot; one popular physicist proclaimed), Metaphysics is the hoary old guru that tugs on science's collar and squacks, &quot;Look here, sonny, settle down, we don't have all the answers.&quot; Whether this explains the claims of some scientists that metaphysics (or philosophy in general) is redundant and irrelevant, who knows. What is known is that Metaphysics, and philosophy in general, is a place for questions that don't yet have answers. This book provides an excellent introduction to the field of metaphysics, and by the end of the book the reader will have a very good idea of its basic (but indefinite) scope and the questions it asks.<br />The introduction to the book lays the groundwork for philosophical thought. The author warns the reader not to expect to come out of this reading with any new &quot;information&quot; in the way a physics or biology textbook would teach you something concrete and almost unquestionable. Metaphysics is all about questions that dangle on the head of a pin, and the logic and methodologies one uses to sway the question to one side or the other (or maybe both or neither). The introduction basically admits that metaphysics is not a science and one shouldn't expect scientific knowledge from its study. This chapter alone should be required reading for all new philosophy students (I could have used it at the beginning of my studies some years back - it would have saved me a lot of second guessing and frustration).<br />The book is basically a whirlwind tour of philosophy that incorporates metaphysical questions and historical arguments. The monism of Spinoza and monism in general are examined. Bishop Berkeley's view of the external world (or lack of it) is put to various arguments. Anti-Realism is considered by the author almost incomprehensible (this chapter is pretty interesting). The classic ontological and cosmological arguments are picked apart (the notion of 'possible worlds' is also introduced) and finally subjects concerning human beings themselves are discussed at length: are we physical or non-physical things? Do we have free will? What is rationality? Each subject is put to the test: the author presents both pros and cons of all the positions one can take on the views, but ultimately the author has a side that he's arguing for. He's not shy about it, either, but he does present all sides fairly, not just the ones he's arguing for. Sometimes it's difficult to tell where the author will come out. In some chapters he seems to be arguing overwhelmingly for one position, when he is in fact for the opposite. This will keep you on your mental toes.<br />One almost shocking thing about this book is that the author presents his beliefs to the reader before he tears into the arguments. This is pretty rare in philosophy texts, and is very admirable considering that these confessed beliefs do not seem to interfere with the logic or reasoning of his arguments. I found that move pretty gutsy.<br />If you have a philosophy degree, likely the information in this book will not be new. Nonetheless, it is true that a degree is in no way required for reading this book. It was meant to be, as Van Inwagen says in the preface, &quot;...a book that the - I hope not mythical - 'interested general reader' can pick up and read without guidance from an instructor.&quot; This doesn't mean that it's an easy read, quite the opposite. Following the logic of the arguments in many places takes patience. If you're new to some of the concepts, letting them soak in will also take some time. Regardless, this is probably the best introduction to the subject of metaphysics currently out there. Too bad about the cover; it makes the book like a dry overly academic textbook, which it's not. Even if you're skeptical about the value of philosophy, this book will give you something to chew on. But don't expect light and lazy rainy afternoon reading.t makes the book like a dry overly academic textbook, which it's not.

In the bibliography of this diminutive book on a gargantuan subject, the author writes: &quot;Mine is a book only partly built upon other books. Much more of its material comes from simply living in the world and looking about. Even more, it derives from gazing into my own heart, which has never for long, alas, been entirely envy-free.&quot; Thus a study of envy becomes a near confessional and self-searching as to the &quot;why&quot; of envy. Why does one feel envy towards things others have? Does envy figure largely in the history of the world and its political and social evolution? Is envy an integral part of human nature, or have we created a world that is laced to the core with envy? Of course there are few, if any, answers to these questions above the controversial. This book provides a brief and entertaining survey into the world of envy. The subject being as it is, the book is of a more necessarily philosophical tone.<br />Those who have studied envy may not find much new here, apart from the confessions of the author concerning the envy that has impacted his life. These confessions allow one to reflect on one's own trangressions of envy and to feel a little comfort that others have also allowed themselves to sink so low. It may be a tautology to say that those without envy cannot possibly be human. Who, no matter how successful, has not had a twinge of envy for another's wealth, lifestyle, physique, spouse or lover, moral virtue or indifference to moral depravity? Who has never smiled at the failure of such people, even though no real ill will is directed at them? The only comforting words to those self-reflecting on these issues are &quot;you are not alone.&quot;<br />This book also addresses more technical issues, such as the levels that envy can occur at. There's jealousy, envy, resentment, and, finally, &quot;ressentiment&quot; (which takes the form of &quot;I'm not good at painting, but painting as an art form is overvalued anyway&quot;). You don't have to be moral scum to succumb to any of these forms of envy. What you can do is be aware of them and not allow them to control your life. This book will at least guide you in that, and it may make you appreciate the levels your envy has not reached (if you're so fortunate). But again, the subject being as it is, much that is subjective enters the playing field. How does one know if one is acting from an envious urge or a feeling of injustice done to one or others? These can be dangerous lines to draw, and interpretations of motivations can, and will almost always inevitably be, mired down in cross-interpretation.<br />The book does a good job of bashing the envy created by &quot;socialism&quot; and the tyrannies that arose in its name in the Soviet Union and China, but capitalism as a potential hotbed of envy is only lightly touched upon. Surely the contemporary United States is brewing with envy on multiple levels, driven by insatiablilty and spattered with the concern for the individual over the collective (a generalization, true, but one for which countless examples exist). The book would be even more relevant if it touched heavier on the envy created by the world's current superpower, and the ramifications of this envy both domestically and globally. To be fair, he does give us the examples of the Greeks, who knew that they were riddled with envy, and made efforts to keep the emotion in check. The country that I live in would do very well to learn from, at least on this topic, our seemingly wiser ancestors.<br />So take what you will from this tiny book. It is more of a popular book than a scholarly treatise (which is likely the aim of the series that can trace itself back to an idea of Ian Fleming's). If you have never studied or read a book on envy, then dig right in, there is plenty here to chew on. There is a long reading list in the bibliography (do not skip the bibliograpy!) for those seeking further enlightenment or tentacled confusion - depending upon your point of view.

Some of the big, thick and juicy history books can make the average reader's eyes bulge with terror. \\"The History of the Whole World!\\" or \\"World History Second by Second!\\" will probably disencourage the general interested reader by the threat of massive papercuts alone.<br />There's something about the word \\"cartoon\\" that adds appeal to any subject. \\"The History of the Universe!\\" by itself may make knees tremble, but \\"The CARTOON History of the Universe!\\" now my hands are a-grabbin' at the bookshelf. And grab we should; we should grope, fondle, and possess this great volume that will likely turn any historaphobe into a walking timeline.<br />History? Entertaining? NEVER! Yes, awake from your dogmatic slumbers, the dream can be realized. This book is funny, genuinely funny. And it's not a parody along the lines of \\"1066 and All That\\" - it's real history presented in an amazingly underrated educational genre.<br />The first book is chopped up into seven volumes which can be read more or less like serial comic books. Dramatic teasers provide segueways between the volumes, and keep the story flowing. Like it's subtitle says: \\"From the Big Bang to Alexander the Great\\", and since subtitles never lie, that's what you get.<br />THE BIG BANG starts off this book, and the book follows an evolutionary line - at one point outright stating \\"Darwin was right\\" (pg. 52). So, be warned all of you whose cars are adorned with fishes labeled \\"Truth\\" eating smaller fishes labeled \\"Darwin\\" - this tome may not be for you.<br />There is a long discussion about the evolution of sex, some \\"naughty\\" cartoons - which are usually hilarious - which leads into the evolution of species from the cambrian to the quaternary period. Humanity enters the scene, and the evolution of humans is covered through homo habilis to the \\"Cro-Magnon Conquest of the World\\". From then on some of the major early peoples and their societies are covered: Sumeria, the Semites, the Egyptians, the Acheans, the Hittites, the Assyrians, the peoples of the Old Testament, the Philistines, the Acheans, the Spartans, the Athenians... I'm sure I left a lot out, but you get the idea.<br />There is a great chapter on the war between Persia and Greece,  including the events that lead up to it. The final chapter of the book is aptly titled \\"All About Athens\\" and covers such historical stars as Pericles, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc. The book ends, as the aforementioned subtitle promises, with Alexander the Great's entry into India. Volume 7's teaser suggests that book II will linger in India for a bit.<br />The book also includes great footnotes, great drawings (a sidenote: why does the style of the artwork change so drastically in Volume 7?), a great bibliography with short reviews of works Gonick used in researching this cartoon cathedral, and a stubborn refusal to consider anything out of the scope of inquiry. Gonick brings up historical issues that would never be taught in schools (I leave the reader to discover these). Even the issues surrounding the status of women and the rich and the poor are put in for good measure.<br />I can't imagine a better way to be introduced to history, especially for the curious adult, since to say that the book is NOT G-Rated would be an egregious understatement (since the book contains many adult themes, graphic cartoon violence, and descriptions of many disturbing things that make up human history, it's hard to say if the book is for kids or not, notwithstanding the \\"cartoon\\" in the title - I guess this is best left as a personal decision). Still, even those knowledgable in history will enjoy it, because, dang it, it's a comic book after all! Of course, and this is obvious, hopefully this book will serve as a springboard for an interest in history. By itself it's a great outline filled with general knowledge, but supplemented with more reading it becomes a road to unfathomable historical knowledge with which can come a better understanding of our placein the universe.in the universe.	2004-01-02
US	52862047	R1EC26VZ01CL2N	0060957603	952386302	The Making of a Philosopher: My Journey Through Twentieth-Century Philosophy	Books	4	31	32	N	N	The Making of a Mysterian...	Philosophers are rarely, far too rarely, given to write a treatment of their field for the general public. Far too many &quot;introductory&quot; philosophy texts claim, in the preface or the intro, that this is a book for neophytes, for philosophical hatchlings waiting to dive off the tree, for &quot;absolute beginners&quot; when, by the third chapter, they're deep into metacognition or technical theories or truth. More often they skim deep subjects, and the skimming only produces useless mist that leaves the beginner dumbstruck and asking &quot;so when do I learn the meaning of life?&quot;<br />This book is thankfully not at the level described above. True, it treats some subjects way too briefly, but it at least does so in a way that will probably whet the appetite, not totally confound. McGinn states his intention clearly in the book (and no, I don't care about &quot;Author's Intentionality&quot; or the &quot;Death of the Author&quot;, at least not now) to write a popular philosophical work. That he has attempted this is admirable. Unfortunately, the most likely reader of this work will be philosophers or academics, which are precisely the people who probably shouldn't read it. Colin McGinn may be &quot;famous&quot; but he's not too famous outside of academia. I have yet to meet anyone outside of &quot;philosophical circles&quot; that's heard of him. The testimony from Oliver Sacks may help, but most likely people looking for more than what's here will pick up the book, be disappointed that it's too cursory, and accuse McGinn of self-congratulation (he is a bit self-congratulatory in places, but one has to make philosophy seem worthwhile while one is attempting to sell it).<br />All of this is too bad, because the book does succeed in many places in making the &quot;philosophical life&quot; sound at least intriguing, challenging, and worthwhile. Insiders already know the life, and so that part of the book will probably be lost on them.<br />Some of the more interesting passages deal with politics in academia. Those who flew to academia to escape the politics of corporate life and business did not escape as completely as they thought. In academia you get put in your place. In academia there is nepotism, cronyism, pointless squabbles over who gets what position and why, and the always dreaded budget looms and threatens your projects, positions, and teaching loads. McGinn shows glimpses of this part of academia throughout the book. His run in with Micheal Dummett (who he claims ran him down in front of colleagues, though we obviously don't hear Dummett's side) and his depressing falling out with Oxford are just two salient examples.<br />Overall the book is a fast read, except for some passages that get a little more into the nitty gritty of technical details (but not too much). This book will not teach you how to be a philosopher, nor will it teach you philosophy (except at a very microscopic level). It may inspire you to look into philosophy, or to read St. Anselm, or Chomsky, or Saul Kripke, or Wittgenstein. Maybe some readers can relate with McGinn's &quot;philosophical seduction&quot; by the writings and life of Bertrand Russell (Russell did have an uncanny knack for writing books that make readers feel intelligent just for reading them; he is very seductive), but these readers will not be newcomers. After all, McGinn claims in the last chapter that Jennifer Aniston has never heard of Russell, or even Descartes for that matter, which is surprising (who hasn't heard of the &quot;I think therefore I am&quot; guy?).<br />McGinn has some healthy messages for the institution of philosophy. One of them is that philosophy should not be a science. 20th century philosophy, particularly Russell's philosophy - as a negative example - and the &quot;linguistic turn&quot; have suggested this. If philosophy were to become a science then scientists would truly be correct when they claim that philosophy is redundant. A second message is that certain philosophical questions may simply be beyond the human cognitive domain (McGinn's philosophy was rewarded with the moniker &quot;mysterian&quot; for this claim). Whether this is true or not it is a position to be considered when answering philosophical questions.<br />The book does not talk about the practical aspects of philosophy, or how can the average person could potentially use philosophy in their daily lives, which is too bad. Its focus is mostly the academic realm, which is a focus that runs the risk of losing some readers who are either unsympathetic towards or clueless about this strange sect. Nonetheless, the book is a good read and could serve as a good introduction to someone considering the &quot;philosophical life&quot; (read &quot;academic philosophical life&quot;) as a career. There are warnings to heed in this book for the philosophical careerists out there.hat certain philosophical questions may simply be beyond the human cognitive domain (McGinn's philosophy was rewarded with the moniker &quot;mysterian&quot; for this claim).

No Thank you!	This book demonstrates that being a Roman Emporer was not necessarily something to envy. Once proclaimed, the emporer had to delicately balance happiness between the public at large, the senate, and - most importantly - the praetorian guard (basically the emporer's bodyguards). There are many examples in this book of emporers upsetting one of these groups too much and ending up with their heads on pikes. It seems to have been a shaky, difficult office to maintain. Very few emporers ended their days in peace, and many were brutally murdered (I cringed more than once while reading this book). One big lesson that too many emporers learned the hard way: do not mess with the praetorian guard.<br />This book begins with a brief summary of the city of Rome: how it grew from a monarchy to a Republic and how Octavian secured absolute power from the Senate and became Augustus, marking the beginning of Imperial Rome, which was to be the Western empire's final phase. The book has three sections: The First Emporers (from Augustus to Domitian); The High Point of Empire (Nerva to Alexander Severus); Crisis and Renewal (Maximinus Thrax to Constantine & Licinius); The Last Emporers (Constantine II to Romulus Augustulus). The book also has a continous timeline that runs through sections of the book for an at-a-glance history.<br />It's important to note that this is not a history of the Roman Empire; it's a history of the Roman Emporers. Events not directly (or somewhat) tied to an emporer are not covered. You won't learn about the daily life of a Roman, for example. Still, through the lineage of emporers a history of the empire in general can be extracted. Who fought who, who tried to overthrow who, descriptions of how emporer's wives or mothers influenced (and sometimes took over) government, the conversion from traditional pagan Rome to a Christian Rome (it wasn't ALL Constantine), etc. The fall of Rome is not covered in great detail (the final section is the shortest and the detail becomes almost minimal), but the basic idea that the empire was overrun by various peoples emerges.<br />The pictures, maps, and graphs throughout the book are incredible and complement the text very well. There are maps of conquests, borders of the empire at specific times, coins, maps of the city of Rome, pictures of busts and mosaics of emporers, architectural reconstructions, pictures of buildings in their current state, etc.<br />Though this book will not make you an expert on the Roman Empire, it provides a great outline from which to learn more. Once it's read, keep it handy for reference. There are many lessons that can be learned from the lives and mistakes of the men (and women) who ruled Rome.ail becomes almost minimal), but the basic idea that the empire was overrun by various peoples emerges.<br />The pictures, maps, and graphs throughout the book are incredible and complement the text very well.

This book includes two early stories, both of which have everything you would expect from Calvino: surrealism, wisdom, fabulism, and poignancy derived from bizarre and unexpected sources. Reading them is a unique experience, much like reading anything Calvino has written; these stories, being earlier works, are slightly more conventional (for Calvino) in that they follow a plot line and a story unfolds linearly (contrasted with later works such as &quot;Invisible Cities&quot; or &quot;Cosmicomics&quot; where there's a story, but not in a completely conventional sense).<br />&quot;The Nonexistent Knight&quot; is about just that: a knight in Charlemagne's army who doesn't exist, but &quot;inhabits&quot; an empty suit of armor. The knight, Agilulf, is an exemplar of chivalry, and annoys almost everyone. When the validity of his knighthood is brought into question, a great chase ensues between the main characters of the story, which, when the smoke clears, culminates in a &quot;confession&quot; of the narrator. The story's mood is a strangely profound tongue-in-cheek. It is moving, funny, and intense.<br />&quot;The Cloven Viscount&quot;, by contrast, is a harsh and violent story that includes enough whimsy to keep it from sinking into a hopelessly depressing tale. After the mostly upbeat feel of &quot;The Nonexistent Knight&quot; the brutal imagery of this story is shocking. The story involves a Viscount who is in fact cloven, that is, literally cloven in two by a Turkish cannon. He is not only cloven physically, but in other more interesting ways. The implications this story presents are numerous and incredibly thought-provoking. When the two halves of the Viscount occupy the same town, the feelings of the townsfolk are summed up in this brilliant passage: &quot;...our sensibilities became numbed, since we felt ourselves lost between an evil and a virtue equally inhuman.&quot;<br />This short book is another incredible example of the writing of Italo Calvino. It may not be his absolute best work, but even Calvino at his worst makes for engaging and unforgettable reading. His stories defy description and stretch the boundaries of literature beyond what is usually expected. After reading one of his books, you just want to read more.the writing of Italo Calvino.

It completely smashes the western stereotype that comics are merely \\"for kids\\" and are supposed to be predictable, cute, and shallow.<br />Krazy Kat is not necessarily for kids. Your kids probably won't get it (and if they do, put them in an honors class immediately), though they may find pleasure in the slapstick elements. The strip is based on a bizarre love triangle between a \\"Kat\\" (Krazy, whose gender is indeterminate), a mouse (Ignatz)and a dog(Offisa Pupp). The Kat loves the mouse who hates the Kat who is hated by the dog who loves the Kat. I'm sure that was crystal clear. There are many ways to interpret this triumvirate, but I like to think it's about longing or futile and innocent longing and the inevitable obstacles that keep life from being perfect. The only way Ignatz acknowledges Krazy's existence is by throwing bricks at his/her head. Krazy has rationalized this into an act of love, and so pines away for Ignatz to toss a brick at him/herself. Offisa Pupp wants nothing more than to catch Ignatz in the act, and so the battle of good and evil begins with innocence trapped in the middle somewhere. An act of love then negates another perceived act of love. The strip is easier to experience than it is to explain (as you've probably just noticed).<br />This is yet another GREAT release from Fantagraphics. The graphic design on the cover and throughout is wonderful, and there are interesting and amusing \\"bonus materials\\" inside.<br />One of the \\"bonus\\" articles talks about the change in American humor away from slapstick and surreal humor towards more of a post-vaudeville early Bob Hope style of comedy. It was during these years of transition that Krazy Kat fell out of favor with the public at large, but William Randolph Hearst (yes, \\"Citizen Kane\\") loved the strip and demanded that it stay in the papers. His editors pleaded with him to cut it, but Hearst stood by the strip (Herriman also had a lifetime contract with Hearst, according to the article). The article goes into detail on these issues. It is a very good read.<br />Also, in the back of this installment is a reprint of the actual sheet music for the \\"Krazy Kat Rag\\" published in 1911, before Krazy had his/her own strip.<br />And of course there's plenty of classic full page strips. But be warned! There are no pages missing - many Krazy Kat strips were reprinted on particular dates, and in 1929 the first non-repeated Sunday strip appeared on Februray 10th. This is explained in the back of the volume on the \\"Ignatz Mouse Debaffler pages\\" along with some late 1920s anachronisms. So when you turn to the 1st strip in the book, the date will say \\"February 10th\\" which is fine. I admit I panicked at first until I consulted the all-knowing debaffler page.<br />Overall another great addition to the ever growing available collection of Krazy Kat in print. May Fantagraphics continue in pleasing the Krazy Kat freaks (like myself) until every Krazy Kat strip possible has been reprinted.

It's also an incredible parody of Japanese martial arts anime and a great study of how gender and appearances dictate how a society views an individual.<br />The artwork is top notch, though this 1st volume pales slightly in comparison to later volumes(the lines are not as sharp and the figures not as well defined, but you won't care). There is nudity (drawn with anime proportions) and there are heavily anthropomorphized animals (also drawn with anime proportions). The blend of all these features results in a hilarious (you will laugh out loud), cute, erotic, and insightful package.<br />The premise is very simple: a father and son accidentally fall into &quot;cursed springs&quot; while training in China. When the father gets wet, he turns into a large panda (who finds out quickly that &quot;Augh! Pandas can't talk!&quot;). Likewise, when the son, Ranma, gets wet &quot;he&quot; changes into a &quot;she.&quot; Reality is thrown a greasy wrench many times with this premise. I would have loved to have read the first volume when it originally came out, with no clue as to what was going to happen. Knowing the story beforehand ruins the shock a bit (but, again, it's so good that you won't care).<br />It may not be clear to those who have not read other anime that Ranma 1/2 is parody. Villians have ridiculous and exaggerated powers. Fights are started and honor is shattered over exceedingly trite events or insults. The fights are actually funny, but also maintain tension. It's a perfect tongue-in-cheek and tongue-out-of-mouth combination. Kuno is a great character and a parody of the sensitive yet fiery type often seen in anime. Some of the best moments are when Kuno and Ranma battle. The extra catch is that Kuno is in love with the &quot;female&quot; Ranma, but in a duel to the death with the &quot;male&quot; Ranma. In more than one case a battle becomes a pine for love, and it's amazing.<br />Having a character that changes gender allows the author to play other characters off of the gender-changing character. This is the best part of Ranma 1/2: characters react to and interact with Ranma in incredibly different ways depending upon what gender Ranma is at a particular moment. Kuno is a great example of this: he truly loves and hates the whole Ranma. Battles will sometimes include a gender change with interesting results.<br />There's much more to this anime than a review can contain. This first volume introduces the major characters (though one of the best characters, the old man who collects underwear, does not appear for a number of volumes) and introduces the story line that carries the series through at least 20 volumes. It's one of the best animes out there, and maybe one of the best introductions to anime for the uninitiated.anges gender allows the author to play other characters off of the gender-changing character.

The reader should not go into this work expecting to come out understanding Nietzsche, but maybe make him a little less obscure or receive a slight bit more context in which to read Nietzsche's books. For those who have already read some Nietzsche and are left nonplussed, this tiny book may help you out as well (it did me).<br />The book follows Nietzsche's publications more or less in chronological order. The longest and most difficult chapter is the one on \\"The Birth of Tragedy.\\" This work gets the most attention of all of Nietzsche's works, presumably because it is easier to \\"sum up\\" or encapsulate than any of his other works. For instance, the section on \\"The Genealogy of Morals\\" will leave you wondering what the book is about (in fact, reading the book itself may also have this effect - it's a tad difficult).<br />\\"Morality and its Discontents\\" is one of the most illuminating chapters, and will shed some light on Nietzsche's proclamation that \\"God is dead\\" which is probably his most infamous and misunderstood concept (there's also a lot more meat to it than the eternal recurrence and the Ubermensch, which Tanner points out).<br />Overall I agree with Tanner's assessment of Nietzsche's \\"Thus Spake Zarathustra.\\" It was the first book of his I read, and I came out of the experience energized, but I had no idea why. \\"Zarathustra\\" is a passionate but potentially misleading read. It's nothing like his other works, and introduces concepts that never come up again, though they seem to be of utmost importance in the context of the book (i.e., the eternal recurrence, Ubermensch, and the will to power - at least in his published works).<br />The pace of Tanner's book quickens and the delineation of Nietzsche's texts becomes more and more sparse towards the final few chapters. There is very little information about Nietzsche's insanity, or Lou Salom&eacute; or even the details of his life. The book is almost completely dedicated to Nietzsche's philosophy. In fact, the book ends as abruptly as Nietzsche's own sane life must have. There's a slight feeling of \\"so what's next?!?\\" at the end of the last and shortest chapter that discusses the works of 1888 in a flash.<br />Nietzsche is a huge subject, and his books are thick conceptually if not physically. He was a thinker that wanted to teach us to think differently, which makes him a valuable read no matter what your stance on the views he covers. This minute book will help you peek through the keyhole of this enormous and overwhelming subject.<br />Lastly, Richard Wagner figures hugely in Nietzsche's work. Knowing more about Wagner will only elucidate some of Nietzsche's works and concepts. Tanner also supports this view.The book is almost completely dedicated to Nietzsche's philosophy.

Spinoza is a strange and interesting philosopher. His life sticks out in the history of philosophy. He not only philosophized, but he lived his philosophy. Q.E.D.<br />II. After an assassination attempt, Spinoza managed to get excommunicated from the Amsterdam synagogue in 1656. Q.E.D.<br />III. Spinoza turned down prestigious university posts and instead made his living grinding glass lenses. At the same time he composed a classic metaphysical system that he also applied to a political system. Q.E.D.<br />IV. Spinoza was one of the first philosophers to claim that the aim of the state is individual freedom. Q.E.D.<br />V. Though Spinoza's metaphysics belong to a different time, it is an example of how a theory of existence can be applied to a manner of living and being. Q.E.D.<br />VI. This book provides a good but very short introduction to the life and philosophy of one of the most interesting philosophers in the history books. Q.E.D.<br />VII. Spinoza managed to live a very humble life and still attain fame and recognition in his own time. He corresponded with Huygens, Newton, Leibniz, and other eminent people of the 17th century. Q.E.D.<br />VIII. Spinoza's works were so controversial they were either not published during his lifetime or published anonymously shortly after his death. Q.E.D.<br />IX. Spinoza's metaphysical system was based on pantheism, which posited that everything and everyone is God, so that if you hurt another you hurt yourself. There are corollaries to the modern Gaia hypothesis in this. Q.E.D.<br />X. This book will leave you wanting to know more about Spinoza and why he wrote in a strange numbered aphoristic manner. It can be read in a single reading and will acquaint you with Spinoza and why he is considered important. Q.E.D.<br />XI.

If you're already a seasoned programmer you might get bored quickly, but if you're learning VB.NET from the ground up, this book is perfect.<br />The book is application based, which means that in each chapter you either build or enhance an application from the ground up. This is a great way to see how the concepts translate into reality. You also have to run the programs, so likely there will be the inevitable debugging problems (which is good to get used to if you want to program).<br />It's slow paced, as it should be for the beginner. There are entire chapters devoted to text boxes and variables and checkboxes. To give you an idea of the pace, Control structures don't appear until chapter 10 (200 pages into the book); Classes and Objects aren't discussed until chapter 19 (400 pages into the book), and Database programming doesn't come along until chapter 25 (almost 600 pages into the book). If you're hoping to learn VB.NET quickly, this is not the book for you. This book is for the programmer who wants mounds and mounds of detail. Persistence will pay off, and when you've eyed the final text on page 752 you'll be well versed in the basics of the Visual Studio.NET IDE and the Visual Basic.NET language (including the basics of Object-Oriented programming and the .NET class libraries). There are even 4 chapters dedicated to ASP.NET to give you a taste of the web programming capabilities of Visual Studio.NET.<br />I read this book for a refresher (I have previous experience in Visual Basic 6 and Visual Basic.NET) and I was able to complete about 2-3 tutorials from the book per day, which computes into less than a month's time investment. Now I feel pretty confident that I have the fundamentals down.<br />If you're new to programming, or if you want a back-to-the-basics VB.NET book, this one is a good read.	2003-06-24

This book fits well into the Penguin Lives series - none of them are meant to be definitive pictures of the person being written about, but most of them succeed in giving a good glimpse of a person's life and accomplishments, however, most are over far too quickly and with many details left to further reading. That's not necessarily a bad thing if it's what you're expecting.<br />This book on Elvis is a WHOOSH WHAT HAPPENED?!?! sort of a quick read. Before I knew it I was turning the final page. Elvis' forty-two years were exhausted in a few hours of reading.  The prose is mostly very readable, but early on the author didn't seem to know what to write about Elvis' childhood, so she rhapsodizes on the taste of hamburgers or makes numerous Faulkner references. I almost didn't make it past the first few chapters. Admittedly, there is probably a lack of material on this part of Elvis' life, but that doesn't mean we need a short essay on the lucious taste of hamburgers and how Elvis surely loved them.<br />Happily, Faulker is never mentioned in subsequent chapters, and the dearth of material vanishes. What follows is a good but all too quick and somewhat one-sided view of the life of Elvis. There is a hint of a 'Poor Elvis' theme as the author continually mentions his \\"innocence.\\" Even towards the end of his life, when Elvis was literally destroying himself and seemed somewhat nuts, the tone is mostly sympathetic. The author almost blames Elvis' fame more than Elvis himself.  It is true that fame can destroy a person. It's happened to too many people (even many who were never famous), but typically there's something else about the person that causes this self-destruction rather than simply the fact that they're famous. Though to be fair, it's a short book so all sides of the story cannot be told.<br />If you're already versed in  the life of Elvis Presley you'll likely find little new information here. I used the book as a starting point. I wanted to know more about Elvis' life, but I wasn't sure to what extent. This book was perfect as a glimpse into what happened to Elvis and the major events of his strange life. As a result of reading this book, I would really like to know more details about his \\"fall.\\" This book whizzes through his final years by outlining some crazy stories such as Presley's visit with Nixon, his fascination with karate, his bizarre stage shows (to my generation, Elvis' 70's stage shows are strange and almost surreal to watch), the origin of his 70's persona (there's more to it than Captain Marvel), his divorce from Priscilla (good for her!), his becoming a narcotics officer, and his overall increasingly obsessive behavior. There's much more there I'm sure than this book tells, though it's probably not a happy tale, and this book strives to be a happy book.<br />The book does not mention accusations pointed at Elvis of racism. There are positive quotes from Little Richard, a Black Panthers Leader, and Elvis himself. Right or wrong, many people my age see Elvis as a thief of \\"black music\\" and as a symbol of white cultural appropriation and domination. I'm not supporting or denying this view, but the book implicitly takes the stance that this is not an issue or that \\"everything's okay\\" on this count. Elvis, along with Sam Phillips, is celebrated as a joiner of the races. This is at best controversial. Nonetheless, the overly positive view the book takes makes me want to learn more about this topic.<br />The book also goes a little light on Elvis' movies. They are far worse than the book leads on (I've seen all but a couple of them). It's easy to see how his legendary status declined since most people born after Elvis' death experience him first through his movies. It's really very hard to take Elvis seriously when your first exposure to him is \\"Paradise Hawwaiian Style\\", \\"It Happened at The World's Fair\\", or \\"Harum Scarum.\\" In the end, his films did far more damage to his name than Elvis could ever imagine. Historically, it's telling that while the Beatles were working on Seargent Pepper, Elvis was working on \\"Clambake.\\"<br />The book also doesn't mention what is usually considered Elvis' most critically acclaimed album: \\"From Elvis in Memphis.\\" Elvis could make some darn good music when he was focused. His music is generally not album-oriented, however, so many of his albums sound merely like collections of songs strung together. \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" is an exception to this, and is enjoyable from beginning to end. It deserves a mention even in a survey.<br />Overall, the book piqued my interest in Elvis as a cultural icon who took a huge fall for complicated reasons. He is right up there with Marilyn Monroe, Kurt Cobain, and Micheal Jackson in terms of the negative impact fame can have on a life. Concerning the topic of Elvis in general, there's more and less of what you'd think involved. He is a tragic figure and a symbol and a warning of the potential destructive powers of fame and wealth.<br />But if you want to know more details, you'll have to read another book.orically, it's telling that while the Beatles were working on Seargent Pepper, Elvis was working on \\"Clambake.\\"<br />The book also doesn't mention what is usually considered Elvis' most critically acclaimed album: \\"From Elvis in Memphis.\\" Elvis could make some darn good music when he was focused.

This is a very little book dealing with a very big subject: does the internet add or detract from meaning in our lives? Such a topic can be covered only in a cursory way within 107 pages, but the major issues are represented in this book, and provide valuable food for thought.<br />Some of the questions asked are: can the internet deliver us from our bodily selves? Can the internet be used to disseminate information more efficiently and more universally? Can the internet democratize education and produce experts? What is the effect of the internet on the real? And, lastly, what are the implications of meaning in our lives concerning the internet?<br />These are all good questions, and each one could fill a volume on its own. Nonetheless, this book is a survey on the topics, and each topic is dealt with in about 20-30 pages.<br />On the issue of disembodiment and the internet, Dreyfus goes out on a limb himself while accusing others of doing the same. Why rely on the vision of the 'Extropians' (whose website is still active as of this typing) for guidance about how people are using and conceiving the internet? The vision of the web as a disembodied non-physical realm where humans will no longer have to deal with intestinal gas is a vision shared by very, very few. Dreyfus gives this concept far too much validity, and the first section of this book creates a sort of 'phantom threat' of people wanting to release themselves from their bodies (he calls it 'Cyberia'), and warnings about the consequences of wanting to do so.<br />The interesting part of the first section is the discussion of the failure of AI and the failing hope that cyberbeings will one day replace human beings. Those who are freaked out by the implications of 'The Matrix' will find comfort here.<br />Dreyfus' best arguments concern the internet and distance learning. Anyone working in education can tell you about the dismal failure of trying to replace human teachers with computers. That's not to say a certain amount of knowledge cannot be obtained from cyber-learning, but that knowledge has its limits. Expert knowledge is even difficult if not impossible from reading books (which has a certain amount of disembodiment in its own, but different, way). Face-to-face or body-to-body interaction is important, and will likely always be important, in mastering a subject or skill. That's why those who can afford it still hire tutors.<br />Similar arguments are put forth concerning the internet becoming a 'virtual world' in which people can potentially get sucked into and lost. It's true that this can happen, but the internet is not necessarily to blame. People can get sucked into drugs, television, reading, fantasizing, etc., and lose themselves in much the same way they can on the internet. Addictions take many forms, and the internet is but one. Still, a word of caution is justified here: the danger in the confusion of 'telepresence' - or, just because you see someone on your screen means that you're having a 'human experience' - with actual human contact is real and needs to be noted. It is not as great a danger as Dreyfus presents, however. To some it may be, but an edpidemic of Cyberians seems unlikely at this point. Also, Dreyfus points out that using the internet does not involve risk on the human level. This is becoming less and less true. It's not too hard to find out who is behind a pseudonym these days, and identity theft and monetary threat loom more and more. Not to mention that everything you type and look up on the internet is stored somewhere, and can be retrieved for purposes of marketing or otherwise. There are risks, on a fundamental human level, with internet use.<br />Concerning meaning and the internet, Dreyfus' claims that the internet leads to nihilism are not wholly convincing. They're based on the Kierkegaardian notion of the aesthetic and ethical life. Where Dreyfus sees problems, he defers to Kierkegaard.<br />Overall, the book presents a negative view on the present and future of the internet. Today it seems almost paranoid in places.The .COM burst gave us all a dose of reality, and there will likely be others to come as far as the internet is concerned. We're not to Dreyfus' distopia yet. Time may change that, or it may not. Likely more threateninig technologies will have to surface first.<br />This is a good place to start for exploring the philosophical implications of the internet.

Comics do not get much better than Krazy Kat. These new editions have brought me out of mourning for the Eclipse series (the single volumes of which sometimes go for $100+ on e-bay). Plus, these are great looking books and each one is filled with extra info and photographs in the introduction and some cool tidbit in the back (this one has a picture of a wooden Ignatz doll complete with box from the 1920s).<br />Krazy Kat can be classified as art, but hopefully it won't be classified TOO MUCH as art, because it can be appreciated on many levels as well as an artistic one. Krazy's worst fate would be to end up as solely a museum piece for aficionados. Krazy doesn't belong in a museum, he/she belongs in books; which is what makes this series so great. I just wish they could print all of them at once.<br />Krazy Kat works by means of the tension of 3 forces: innocence, evil, and justice. Krazy is the ultimate innocent who, when Offissa Pup pummels Ignatz with his club, merely says \\"Those two play so well togedda.\\" Ignatz is evil and maybe obsession. His grand purpose in life is to \\"bean\\" Krazy with bricks. He sometimes goes to Rube Goldberg extremes to succeed. Offissa Pup is justice which is sometimes just, sometimes political, sometimes personal. In an old daily strip, Offissa Pup grabs Ignatz and says \\"To the jail, viper!\\" When Ignatz replies \\"Why?\\" Offissa Pup only says \\"Because it gives me pleasure.\\" Things get more complex because Krazy loves Ignatz and Offissa Pup often insinuates that he loves Krazy. A futile love triangle and battle of good, evil, and justice gets mixed up in a strange salad.<br />It is simply one of the best comics ever produced.	2003-04-14

For english speakers who have never studied a romance language, verb conjugation almost seems like more trouble than it's worth. Irregular verbs abound and just when you think you know the patterns, some new irregularity comes up and smacks you right in the language faculty.<br />Unfortunately, verb conjugation is a necessary and monotonous part of learning Spanish. Without the ability to conjugate at will and without much thinking, fluency remains a Quixotic dream.<br />&quot;501 Spanish Verbs&quot; will get you up and running on some of the essential verbs of the Spanish language. When you're starting there's no way you're going to remember or not confuse the present subjunctive spelling with the spelling of the conditional or preterite. It's going to happen, and having this book on hand for moments like that will deaden the &quot;what's the point of this!?!?&quot; feeling. Eventually it comes together, and at some point this book will outlive its usefulness.<br />It's important to remember that this is not meant to be a comprehesive guide to Spanish verbs. That's why it's called &quot;501 Spanish verbs&quot; when there's obviously thousands more. 501 is a pretty good number of verbs to have on hand at the beginning of learning Spanish. It will get a reader through most children's books or basic reading. This book is to be mastered and built upon, not to be seen or used as a final resting place for learning about Spanish verbs. It should be used with the idea that someday it will be abandoned. If a learner of Spanish gets to that point then the book has done its job.	2003-04-13

It is clearly written (there are typos but they're not insurmountable) and shows instant results through coding.<br />An unexpected corollary to this book is that it actually helps with general Windows database programming. The database portions of this book basically deal with ADO, and this knowledge is  applicable to Visual Basic 6 database projects (there are nuances, of course, and one must learn VB, Access and/or SQL Server, but the underlying theory and methodology is very similar). So you actually get more out of this book than you realize.<br />Possessing a working knowledge of HTML is a good thing before taking on ASP 3.0. The book will move slower if you don't. Also knowing something about JavaScript or VBScript will help, but the book does address this (it mostly uses VBScript with ASP 3.0), though having general knowledge of how scripting languages work (e.g., which runs from the server and which from the client and how and why) will speed up learning ASP.<br />This book will not prepare you for ASP.NET or ADO.NET. Those are different animals, and the book predates them both. Regardless, there is a lot of ASP 3.0 out there, and it will not likely go away soon. At the moment you have a choice: learn ASP 3.0 or learn ASP.NET. It depends on your needs. If you end up choosing ASP 3.0, this is the book to start with.	2003-03-05

I would not have learned what I know about Spanish verbs if I hadn't bought this book. The price is almost embarassingly low, and the amount of information you get for your money is astounding.<br />This book will help with reading comprehension and writing of Spanish. All of the verb tenses are covered, and accompanied by exercises that solidly reinforce the material.  All you need to do is sit down with a pencil or pen, start reading and then start writing. The exercises are designed to reinforce your learning, and you'll be surprised how much you retain from completing them. I am almost  completely self-taught (I had some help from some native speakers with conversation), and this book was a part of my language-learning arsenal that helped me more than get by with Spanish in South America and Spain.<br />LIttle by little the book goes through the various Spanish verb tenses starting with the present (hablo, hablas, etc). Before that the book goes over some basics like pronouns to provide a foundation (yo, te, me, elle, etc.). From there the book  goes on to cover every Spanish verb tense I've ever heard of, including an elucidating few chapters on the subjunctive. You can literally start with almost no knowledge of Spanish. The book will not  help you with speaking, however, nor will it teach you everything. Believe the words on the cover: this book is about verbs.<br />Verb conjugation may not be the most exciting thing humans have come up with, but this book almost makes conjugation fun (did I say that? No, not me, must have been someone else).<br />You certainly can't go wrong for the price.	2003-02-09

I discovered his work in used book stores and was hooked the moment I saw it. What started was a manic tour to find all of his books. Next was convincing everyone I knew at the time that Kliban was a genius. Some bought, some flinched.<br />Kliban's work would have no home in today's \\"funny pages.\\" It's entertainment for adults (he began his career with Playboy magazine) and his work is scattered with obscenity and nudity. None of it is gratuitous. One thing that heavily separates Kliban's work from other cartoonists' is its depth. Social commentary mixed with metaphysics mixed with surrealism. When he's funny he's gut-wrenchingly funny. When he's profound he's deeply profound (not many cartoonists' work can be called 'profound'). He also uses the pun in a way I've never seen before. He either goes over the top and makes you gag(e.g., \\"Why do you hang out with that sadist?\\" \\"Beats me!\\"), or is very subtle and hilarious (e.g., A buffalo saying \\"I never met an Indian I didn't like, with the possible exception of Kahlil Gibran\\"). His work is nonsensical, absurd and funny.<br />This book includes classics such as \\"The Birth of Advertising\\", \\"Patron Saint of Crullers\\", \\"Contaminated Pork Bldg\\", \\"The Hairy Family Singers\\", \\"Continuous Eye Persons\\", \\"Philosophers Looting a Small Town\\", and many others that defy description.<br />Kliban's closest equivalent in cartooning must be Argentina's Quino. If you're a fan of Kliban, most likely you'll appreciate Quino's work (though some knowledge of Spanish is helpful).<br />Sadly, a lot of Kliban's work is difficult to find these days. His \\"safer\\" books like \\"Cat\\" are readily available, but his more edgy work seems to have nearly vanished. Perhaps someday if  mainstream humor revisits off-the-wall absurdism Kliban's work will be appreciated for what it was.	2003-02-08
US	52862047	R1JO1WMM82N4B	0618260250	669379389	The Lord of the Rings	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Try not to think of the films, if you can...	From this point on, for better or worse, it will probably be impossible to read The Lord of The Rings without the very successful film trilogy (currently still a duo until next December) looming in the background. Probably the best thing about the films is that they will likely entice the reading of the book. The book is very different in some spots, verbatim in others. For example, after seeing the films, it's hard to think of Frodo as being 50 years old when he leaves the Shire (Elijah Wood, Frodo Baggins in the films, barely looks out of his teens), but in the book he is well aged by the time Gandalf sends him on his way. This is only one of many many examples.<br />It's interesting to read the one-volume edition. It's how Tolkien intended it to be presented, as one large novel (Tolkien's publisher divided the story into three parts against his wishes). With the one-volume edition you feel like you're reading something hefty, an old tome from mythology, something with real weight and umph. It's a massive 1008 pages (not including the appendices and index), but it's a fast fast neckbreaking page turning read. It isn't difficult reading (i.e., not much unfamiliar vocabulary apart from terms coined by Tolkien and the passages in Elvish or Mordor), but it is detailed, far more detailed than a film could ever hope to be. It is a book that will reward many repeated readings.<br />Some of the basic themes of the book seem to be hope, despair, singularity, and plurality. There are many places in this book where things seem beyond hope for the heroes. In some places this leads them to despair, which does them no good. Finding hope in despair seems to be one of the book's main themes: we don't know what will happen, so why despair before the fact? All you can do is keep going. In a way the book is an analogy for our lives which are filled with hope and despair, but we keep going on even against impossible odds.<br />Concerning singularity and plurality, on one side there is the fellowship of the ring which is made up of a diverse cast of beings: hobbits, a dwarf, humans, and an elf. They set out to meet their task together while trying their best to put behind their differences. On the other side you have Sauron and the One Ring or singularity. Sauron is trying to bind the world to his single will which is embodied in the ring of power. It ruins those who try to possess it (Humans are particularly susceptible to it). It is pure self-obsession and self-importance. This singularity is put forth as evil, while the plurality of the fellowship is presented as good. It's an interesting dichotomy.<br />Fans of the films will be shocked to see the differences in the story line, especially in \\"The Two Towers.\\" In terms of suspense, the book is far superior to the film (I'm sure the filmmakers would completely agree). I literally could not wait to begin reading \\"The Return of The King\\" and I could not put the book down until I reached page 1008.

They set out to meet their task together while trying their best to put behind their differences. On the other side you have Sauron and the One Ring or singularity. Sauron is trying to bind the world to his single will which is embodied in the ring of power. It ruins those who try to possess it (Humans are particularly susceptible to it). It is pure self-obsession and self-importance. This singularity is put forth as evil, while the plurality of the fellowship is presented as good. It's an interesting dichotomy.<br />Fans of the films will be shocked to see the differences in the story line, especially in \\"The Two Towers.\\" In terms of suspense, the book is far superior to the film (I'm sure the filmmakers would completely agree).

The &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; series is typically great for learning a language if you are a complete newcomer to programming. The title &quot;absolute beginner&quot; suggests this. It's also great because the programming samples are in the form of games.<br />This book, unfortunately, would probably completely confuse or scare off a new programmer. It is likely to confuse even those who are not new to programming. I have a fair amount of experience with VB6 (medium sized database applications with SQL Server backends) and some with VB.NET (I bought the book mostly for the games, but also as a refresher course), and I found this experience necessary for understanding the first few parts of this book.<br />The book consistently uses concepts before they're introduced, and in one place even suggests skipping ahead to the next chapter if what you're reading doesn't make sense.<br />The author makes numerous references to C++ and there are way too many comparisons between VB.NET and VB6. The first few chapters of the book would be way over the head of any brand new programmer. Assembly and machine language are brought up, as well as client/server networks. Why? The author also uses some VB6 in his .NET programs. For example, the &quot;MsgBox&quot; function is not officially a .NET function (it's part of a library .NET keeps to maintain backward compatibility). Sure you can use it, but it may or may not be compatible with other .NET classes down the road (e.g., if you wanted to use it in conjunction with a C# program). It would be best to stick with the more .Nettish &quot;Messagebox.show&quot; command which is entirely compatible with the .NET libraries.<br />Also used are the VB6 &quot;Len(String)&quot; (instead of &quot;String.Length&quot;), &quot;Instr&quot;, &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; functions from the VB6 library. After 5 or 6 chapters I wondered if I was really learning VB.NET or a hybrid of VB.NET and VB6. This wonder turned into a fear: would I have to unlearn anything I picked up in this book? This fear burgeoned to the point that I couldn't continue with the book. I stopped a little more than half way through and returned it to the store.<br />On the bright side, it was really fun programming the games included in this book. And to be entirely fair, I did learn a lot from this book regardless. His description of variables in VB.NET actually being objects was insightful and well thought out. Nonetheless, the fear that I was absorbing wrong information about .NET eventually overpowered me. It's unfortunate, it could have been a great book. Hopefully there will be a second edition that is more in line with VB.NET and does not mention VB6 or C++ once.have to unlearn anything I picked up in this book?

I had to learn SQL programming with Visual Basic 6 in about a month's time for a project. This book taught me everything I needed to know to deliver the application. Everytime I came across a stumbling block in my code or in SQL Server 2000 I found the answer in this book.<br />This book will make you feel that you not only know how to make Visual Basic talk to SQL Server, it will make you feel you know more than the basics of SQL Server itself. Previous to reading this book I had no idea what a stored procedure was, or how a query works in SQL Server (I had worked extensively with Microsoft Access, and these skills were not necessarily transferable to SQL Server, though many of the concepts are similar). Now I know my way around SQL Server 2000. This book fulfilled a dual purpose.<br />There are chapters on Database design, SQL Server installation, SQL Server security, Querying, Stored Procedures, the SQL language, IIS, and XML. Most of the book is taken up with what developers do everyday: the storage and manipulation of data. Over 300 pages of the book is dedicated to data in general, and how to get the most out of it using VB and SQL Server.<br />If you need to create a VB6 (there is no discussion of VB.NET since the book predates it) database application using SQL Server, this is the book to start with. Its bulk pays off.	2003-01-10

This book was on the required list for a class on programming I recently completed (apparently some schools are avoiding using VB.NET in intro classes due to its added complexity). I had always wanted to check out a Deitel book, but the bone-crushing price drove me away more than once. Luckily I was forced into buying it for my class.<br />This is a solid book that will teach you everything you need to know to get started writing simple to somewhat complex VB6 code. The book begins with a history of Visual Basic and how it fits into programming in general. Then you're off and diving right into the VB Development Environment and by chapter 3 you've written a simple program. The book gains in complexity from that point on, but at a slow enough pace to take it all in. In fact, sometimes the pace seems stifling.<br />If you're an impatient person I would avoid this book. It's over 900 very thick pages long and sometimes getting through a single chapter feels like an entire book in itself (chapter 8 &quot;Strings, Dates, and Times&quot; felt this way for me).<br />If you're patient and you learn like a sponge, then be prepared to learn bunches and bunches from this book. By the time you're through you'll even have learned about advanced data structures like linked lists and trees. Getting through this book, despite its academic bulk, feels like a real accomplishment.<br />The exercises at the end of each chapter are invaluable for solidifying concepts and for getting your hands wet and sloppy with code. Definitely don't skip these, you'll learn more from working through them then you will reading the text.<br />It should be noted that the book is not designed for individual study - it is meant to be a textbook for a classroom setting (they say as much in the preface). I think it's most appropriate in that setting (it also has a textbook price).<br />Regardless of it's girth, this book will teach you enough VB6 to program applications of decent complexity. What you won't get is a lesson on API calls or Direct X, but the book is thick enough already!get is a lesson on API calls or Direct X, but the book is thick enough already!	2003-01-09

If you're still using VB6 (many, many are despite the .NET hype) and you need to put together a database-driven application this is the first book you should buy. It covers all of the basics you'll need to go forward with database programming. It includes chapters on good data design, definitions of databases and good interface design (the chapter \\"Creating a bulletproof user interface\\" is useful for any VB6 application, not just database-driven ones). All of this is essential for creating good DB apps, and the author explains these concepts clearly and not too verbosely. It goes beyond the coding and shows you the \\"why\\" behind data storage and manipulation. You'll learn much more than VB code.<br />If you're already conversant in VB6 (the book doesn't assume you are) you will fly through this book. I ossmosized this book, it's that well written, and I was able to absorb everything well in time for a VB project deadline. If you need to learn quickly, this is also the book to get.<br />The book focuses mostly on Microsoft Access DB programming (which makes sense since most beginners do not have an expensive copy of SQL Server just lying around begging for data), and it covers DAO and ADO and delineates the important differences between the technologies. Though the book provides a good foundation for any VB database programming, it will not teach you how to program using VB6 and SQL Server.<br />In short, a great introduction to database programming for Visual Basic programmers. Expect to learn a lot, but don't stop here. Move on to a more advanced book after ingesting this one.	2003-01-08

It taught me Javascript to a point where I was writing code from my head. Patience is required, but it will pay off. The author covers everything from beginning programming concepts, to the Javascript Document Object Model (which will help down the road with many aspects of programming), to Dynamic HTML (i.e., making things fly across the screen or making dynamic menus), database programming with Javascript and ASP, and Active X. It's much more than a beginner's book.<br />Right off the bat the book discusses errors and how to interpret them (an inevitability for any Javascript programmer). That way, as you make mistakes, or mistype something (you will, we all do), you'll know how to handle it instead of flipping through the book screaming for answers.<br />An added bonus is that you build an application as you go. When you're done with the book you have a working Javascript app that you can easily edit to your own whims and publish on the web.<br />I can honestly say that, as I read this book, I experienced none of the frustration I usually experience with programming books. The code examples worked, typos were incredibly scarce, and I knew what to do with those \\"I have to hit something now!!\\" errors that arise in any programming endeavor.<br />It's fair to say that this is not only a good beginning Javascript book, it's also a good introduction to programming. You can write code and easily see instant results, which can be gratifying for a beginner.<br />A good book. Buy and learn.	2003-01-07

They are in fact invaluable when dealing with recall since they combine words and pictures which helps with retention and context.<br />This little book is filled with cartoons from all over the Spanish speaking world. Some you may find funny, others maybe not. You will learn some good Spanish words in a cultural context as well as learn a modicum of that culture.<br />Each cartoon is presented in its original form at the top of the page. Below this are the key words for understanding the cartoon, along with translations of these keywords. This makes it very easy to comprehend and learn the words you do not know in the cartoon.<br />This is probably not a good beginner's book. It does not go into great detail about grammar and verbs. It is designed more for the Spanish learner who already has a basic  background and wants to expand their vocabulary.<br />Lastly, a brief biography of each cartoonist is presented. The cartoons are labeled by Cartoonist and their country.<br />Overall, the book will help someone already somewhat basically proficient in Spanish (you do not need to be an expert by any means) improve their Spanish. It may also make you laugh, but it will definitely provide you with some juicy Spanish right out of Spanish speaking culture.	2002-12-31

I knew almost nothing about the man before cracking the spine on this one. His was a name I've known since very early childhood but I've always been embarassed by my complete lack of knowledge of this ubiquitous figure. Since time is an issue, I've never been able to delve into the many thick books that abound on Napolean in most book stores. Then I saw this book. It's small, it's concise, and it's incredibly readable. Not to mention that I had read some books in the Penguin Lives series and loved them. This book left the store with me on first glance, and was digested in a few days of free time.<br />For the Napolean neophyte this book will introduce you to the basics: his origins, his rise through the ranks of the army, what he did during the French Revolution, how he became emporer, Josephine (there were some surprises here!), his exiles, Waterloo, and what came after his final exile (for both Napolean and for France). It's a quick tour and the book probably needs more than one reading to catch everything. You will get a sense of what Napolean did and why his name is everywhere, particularly in the history of Europe.<br />The book does take the stance that Napolean was an immoral  monster: a conqueror of the worst sort, a self-important dictator who abandoned his men on the battlefield and fit himself and his beliefs to the situtation that would bring him the most power.<br />Whether this is true or not (the author does make a convincing case) this book probably isn't enough by itself to make an overall moral judgment on Napolean. Nonetheless, it makes a great introduction to a vast subject. If you know nothing about Napolean, pick this one up.	2002-12-30

My first reaction was scepticism. Why did I have to read all of this seemingly irrelevant mush? Why not just outline the concepts the way most computer books do?<br />The answer was in that last question: this is not your typical dry computer book that will drag you from topic to topic via mounds of code samples with little explanation. This is the typical computer book's antithesis. Nearly everything is explained in detail, and you get to learn along with a classroom of students. They also have questions which are answered by John Smiley  - playing himself  - in the &quot;tutorial within a story&quot; approach the book uses. It is one of the best approaches to use for beginning programmers that I have seen. It makes the daunting dauntless for the daunted.<br />In addition, you actually build something as you go through this book. By the book's end you have a working program that actually does something, not just a collection of unrelated code samples.<br />The emphasis is heavily on the beginner. Anyone familar with programming concepts will likely be bored and take on the mantra &quot;get on with it.&quot; Consequently, it is not a good Visual Basic reference book.  If you have a &quot;I need to know how to do this now&quot; problem, this book will frustrate you as you try to find it. There's a lot of text. Helpful text, but not given to expediency.<br />One downside, sometimes the story is cheesy in an eye-rolling way (particularly the love-boat style ending). It is a happy world that John Smiley and his class develop in. If only all software development and clients were that easy-going.<br />Nonetheless, it's a great place to start, sappy story or not, and you will learn a great deal about Visual Basic 6, programming concepts, and software development.	2002-12-08

This book is a sensational read, one you won't quickly forget, one that will open your eyes to a lot of what's hidden under and in the food you eat.<br />It's not a finger-pointing diatribe, nor is it a boring list of \\"crimes\\" committed by fast food. It's the story of what's happened to an industry that has over time put profitability way above quality. Essentially, it's put all of us in danger.<br />It's shocking to learn that the UDSA and FDA do not have the power to change the behavior of the major meatpacking and fast food companies. Only their clients have this power (i.e., McDonald's Corp. can demand decent work conditions for the employees of slaughterhouses it buys from, but the USDA and FDA cannot). If this is what former President Clinton meant by \\"the era of big government is over\\" then let's begin a new one. The government needs power when the health of its citizens is put at risk by profiteers.<br />The revelations this book hands you are the kind that make you say \\"this is happening in my country?!?! Here?!?!?\\" The chapter on the \\"flavor industry\\" was so astounding I now wonder if what I'm tasting when I bite into food : is it the food itself or its flavoring additives? It's mind-blowing to think that the taste of the food we eat is a chemical mixture manufactured in a huge chemical factory.<br />Some of the other things this book deals with are downright horrifying. What's cleaner: your toilet or your kitchen sink? How hard is it for a slaughterhouse worker to convince his employer that he's injured? How many people die each year from tainted meat? Salmonella? Why do the fries taste so good? How young do some obese kids die of heart attacks these days?<br />This book will forever change how you look at your food. I became a vegetarian while reading it (not only because of the book, but it definitely helped me decide).<br />This is asking too much of the author, but it would be interesting to find out if the CEOs of the major fast food companies ever eat at their own restaurants. I have this suspicion that they don't, and if this is true, it would be quite telling.<br />The saddest realization I had after finishing this book was that similar books could probably be written for many other industries that put profit before people. Why has this become such a widespread behavior in business? Was it ever not the way to do business? Why do people act this way?<br />This book also in many ways conjured up images of the worst the nineteenth-century had to offer. In many ways we're living through that horror again, and this book provides some solid evidence of that.<br />In the end the author does the best thing he could: empower you. We as consumers need to educate ourselves and buy responsibly and let companies know when we do not approve of their practices or products. We probably have more power in the stores than we have in the voting booths.<br />This book will horrify, sicken, and anger you.

There is justice in the world. After Eclipse stopped their \\"Kompleat Krazy Kat\\" series I feared that no publisher would dare take up the cause for a loooooooong time. I'm having spasms of joy over the continuation of the series. There was indeed no comic (even the best ones) that came close to the subtlety, detail, and substance of Krazy Kat. The irreconcilable love triangle between Krazy, Ignatz, and Offica Pupp provided enough material for decades of brutally good material. These volumes also carry on Eclipse's tradition of good and helpful notes at the book's end to elucidate anachronisms that will inevitably arise in nearly anything approaching a century in age.<br />More good news is Fantagraphic's pledge (near the end of this book) that once they complete the Krazy Kat cycle (kompleat with the kompleat Kolor Komiks in full Kolor), they will go back and republish the years covered by the Eclipse volumes! I was never able to find all 9 volumes, and those that appear on E-bay tend to get VERY pricey ...<br />This is good news for all of the Kat's devoted followers.

It's worth having on your shelf when friends come over and peruse your collection. Without fail they'll pull this one out thinking it's nothing but potty humor. Then they see WHO?!?! Ben Franklin?!?!!? WHAT?!?!?<br />This very small book is a collection of the satire of Ben Franklin. Those of you looking for a good book of fart jokes will be deeply disappointed. Those looking for a good laugh will not be. Those looking to learn more about Ben Franklin will learn a great deal.<br />A few must-reads are &quot;Rules on Making Oneself Disagreeable&quot; (though farting is not mentioned), &quot;On choosing a Mistress&quot; (again, no farting, but it's hilarious), and the best of all &quot;A Letter to a Royal Academy&quot; in which Franklin makes a suggestion to a group of scientists: throw away all your abstract theory and find a way to make farts smell nice. It is the most subtle and disparaging piece I've ever read, and it rides that line between &quot;is he SERIOUS?!?&quot; and &quot;is this is a joke!??!&quot;<br />There are actually historically important pieces in this book, believe it or not. Don't let the title throw you. &quot;Rules by Which a Great Empire May Be Reduced&quot; is cutting satire from right before the American revolution. It ran in papers of the time and made an impact. &quot;The Speech of Miss Polly Baker,&quot; about a woman having children out of wedlock,  was reported as fact throughout the colonies until Franklin admitted the joke.<br />And finally, for those looking for good fart humor, there's &quot;The Dream&quot; from which the book takes its title. Read and giggle 'till you cough.<br />Something the book does not mention is that many of these pieces were originally published anonymously, as was the custom in the 18th century. You would not have seen &quot;'Fart Proudly' by Benjamin Franklin&quot; in the press. Instead there would have been no name on the piece or a false one. Franklin assumed numerous false names throughout his life, as did most authors of the time. Writing was more about what was being written than who was writing it. This has changed drastically in the intervening centuries.<br />Hopefully this selection will whet your appetite for more Ben Franklin. He wrote an incredible amount, much of it is very funny as well as significant. He was no stodgy old professor, as this book more than proves. If you enjoy this collection, go out and get more, or read a biography. You'll find there's much more to Ben Franklin than you ever thought.lse names throughout his life, as did most authors of the time.

In a dialogue Franklin wrote while in Paris, \\"Madame Gout\\" comes to visit him and, while inflicting torment on Franklin with \\"corrections\\" of gout, she chastises him for his indolent lifestyle: \\"While the mornings are long, and you have leisure to go abroad, what do you do? Why, instead of gaining an appetite for breakfast by salutary exercise, you amuse yourself with books, pamphlets, or newspapers, which commonly are not worth the reading.\\"<br />Madame Gout could not fault any of us for amusing ourselves with \\"The First American.\\" It is a well-written, detailed, and objective look at arguably the most important of the United States' founding fathers.<br />It is hard not to become overwhelmed with Franklin's accomplishments. Yet he seemed to flit in and out of various fields of philosophy, science, and politics with an ease that seems impossible today, and with seemingly no more effort than most of us put into walking between rooms of our homes.<br />The book begins with an account of a pivotal event in Franklin's life that led to his eventual break with Great Britian. He was at first a reluctant revolutionary, but this event, in which he was publicly and in person humiliated by Britian, changed the course of his life and his loyalty. It is an excellent way to begin an account of Franklin's life.<br />After this the book moves in chronological order beginning with Franklin's upbringing and eventual abandonment of Boston. When he arrives in Philadelphia alone and poor the momentum begins and does not let up until we arrive at his deathbed. Death seemed to be the only thing capable of stopping him. The dizzying array of fields he dabbled in and made substantive contributions to is staggering.<br />The book has a level of detail that will allow you to appreciate the scope of Franklin's accomplishments within the time they occurred. It is not simply a \\"Wow! Gosh! Can you believe it?!\\" account. There is juice there. We even learn about the indeterminate date of Franklin's birth due to the implementation of the Gregorian calendar. No detail is spared.<br />The author also seems to have an appreciation for what Franklin really stood for. It is often thought Franklin stands for pure  capitalism outright (thanks to his work \\"The Way to Wealth\\"). We learn that Franklin did not patent most of his inventions, passing up opportunities for obvious wealth of obscene proportions. He thought instead of \\"the common good\\" and his inventor's mentality had a more practical, down to earth bend to it. Franklin represents some of what the United States has lost in the intervening centuries, and what kind of thinking we (or any country for that matter) need to embrace to become a better society. True, he was wealthy, but he could have made himself much wealthier given his fame and talents.<br />Of course all of this comes at some price. Franklin was not an ideal family man, and the book also gives a taste of this side of Franklin. Family seemed to play a lesser role in his life than his philosophical and scientific (and later, political) interests. Due to his circumstances he was not able to attend the funerals of either his father or his wife. He had a falling out with his loyalist son that was never resolved. He spent most of his married life away from his wife (she feared sea travel and would not accompany him to Europe, where Franklin spent most of his adult life). He also had a flirtatious side, which the book hints at but does not delve deeply into. One question the book did not answer for me was why he is known as \\"Dirty Ben\\" in some circles.<br />The book also gives a brief but not insufficient history of the American Revolution. Franklin played a pivotal and probably still underappreciated role in securing victory for the colonies.

This book will send you into realms of storytelling that seem impossible even as you read them. Cavort with \\"beings\\" who are present at the beginning of the universe and the big bang; be present at the moment someone (or something) plays with \\"a thing\\" for the first time. A review cannot do this book justice. It is utterly mind-blowing, beautiful, funny, and profound all at the same time. The writing is crystal clear (even in translation), which adds to the book's mystique. One of the best things about this book is the sheer impossibility of making a movie out of it. It exploits the best of what written stories can give us: imagination and the freedom to evoke our own mental imagery. The images floating through my head while I read this defy description. The stories themselves defy description (as I found out when trying to convince others to read it). Why can't more books be like this?	2002-11-19

There was once a time when the utterance \\"Mickey Mouse\\" had no meaning and conjured up no images of vast tracts of decadent land saturated with sugary amusement. The word \\"Felix\\", however, would probably send a jolt through most living in this lost time. Just how popular Felix was is evident in a 1926 photograph of Ligget's Drug Store in Grand Central Station that Crafton included in \\"Before Mickey.\\" The window is nearly filled to the brim with Felix paraphenalia, much like we've seen recently with the Powerpuff Girls, Spongebob Squarepants and Harry Potter. Felix was once just as ubiquitous and just as unavoidable.<br />The events that led up to this incredible success are laid out in \\"Before Mickey.\\" The saga of animation is an interesting and much neglected part of cinema history. The book covers something that is almost never discussed: animation's origins in stop-motion. Everyone should read Crafton's account of \\"The Haunted Hotel\\" - a stop-motion film where objects \\"float\\" through the air and objects move on their own. It terrified audiences and gave impendance to animation with its success. From this it was almost a natural progression to drawings that moved and funny characters in funny situations.<br />Silent animation had its own life and own method of communicating. Everything was in the pictures, and early animation artists made the most of this. It remains, and will probably sadly remain, a very underappreciated art form. We're just too drunk with sound these days.<br />Luckily, you can read this book and get a taste of what those days must have been like, the stories of the pioneers that made it all possible (those in America, at least) and how far we've come in some respects and what we've lost in others.<br />Anyone interested in the early history of animation should read this(after all, there isn't much else out there right now). Also, if you can, buy the tape (is it available on DVD now?) that accompanies the book. It's filled with great animation but sadly missing \\"The Haunted Hotel.\\" It does, however,  include a GREAT Felix the Cat cartoon.but sadly missing \\"The Haunted Hotel.\\" It does, however,  include a GREAT Felix the Cat cartoon.	2002-11-19

What's great about the clothes the people wear is they do not appear to be pre-packaged \\"hip\\" clothes in total. True, I'm sure they're \\"hip\\" (some are probably expensive), but most of the outfits seem to be constructed from many different elements; a pastiche of derivatives that combines into something original and beautiful. You see glimpses of Sanrio, some obviously Western influences here and there, and countless gadgets, shoes, makeup, stuffed animals and items that completely defy description. I'm still not sure what to make of the 'Lolita' and 'Gothic Lolita' descriptions of some of the outfits, but overall an incredibly fun book to just sit and get lost in.	2002-10-27

I am a non-Catholic with very little grounding in the history or structure of the Western Church or of the Papacy. For myself, I would not have fully understood why Angelo Roncalli's Papacy was considered successful without the not so brief but engaging Papal history that takes up 72 of the book's 241 pages. It is a dizzying survey of Papal history, and obviously not definitive, but it gives Pope John XXIII a context within which to appreciate him. Some Catholics may take such a history for granted, and want to get to the meat of Roncalli's story. But, the author has to take into consideration those without a Catholic background so they can understand why he was not only a good Pope, but a good person.<br />Cahill does make much out of what Pope John XXIII had to contend with in the form of conservative Cardinals and Vatican  administrators. There are times Cahill seems too harsh towards these people, and possibly he overplays it to demonstrate Roncalli's legacy. However, the Catholic church does have the reputation as one of the most conservative institutions in the world (there are many examples as to why, the case of forgiving Galileo about 300 years after the fact is only one), so perhaps Cahill's depiction is accurate. It is ultimately hard to know for a Vatican outsider, but Cahill's book, skewed or not, is a great starting place for non-Catholics on the subject of the Papacy.	2002-10-26

This book goes a long way to smash the myths around \\"being a writer.\\" The author argues convincingly that published writers are not necessarily the best writers, and that just because you aren't published doesn't mean you're not a writer. He makes a distinction: writing is about words, publishing is about money. He then goes on to talk about the multifarious ways you can become a writer, overcome writer's guilt complex, writer's block, writers self-consciousness, the \\"I have to write the next important novel\\" syndrome and many others. In short, he excuses the art vs. entertainment squabble as rubbish for someone who just wants to write (one of my favorite sections is entitled \\"A Few Unkind but Well-Deserved Words about Literature\\"). He makes you feel as though you can cut through all of that garbage and actually produce something. Whether it's published or not is beyond the point (but he does talk briefly about selling your work if you want to).<br />If you want to write something and are just plain confused about the entire monolithic subject, this is a good book to sit down and fly through in one sitting and then dip back into later when you need it. It is anything but pretentious and it will help you to write what you want to write.	2002-10-26

Two possible answers are: Work and Leisure. The goal of current US culture appears to be work, at least for the majority of people. Why shouldn't it be leisure instead?<br />This book, written in the very early 1960s, is still relevant today for the questions it asks, which are very neglected but of utmost importance, viz., is the &quot;good life&quot; solely constituted of work? This question is analyzed from a 1960s perspective so it is, sadly, fairly dated in that respect (though it is interesting in its analysis of how people spent leisure time four decades ago). The book is also a little plodding, and the argument is presented in a very disjointed and sometimes overly statistical fashion. I had to literally struggle through some of the later chapters. Nonetheless, the issues are still very relevant, and the questions De Grazia asks are still worth asking today (in fact, they may be more pressing today than they were in the 1960s).<br />The book does include a good historical survey of how the world has looked at leisure since the time of Aristotle. This is how the book begins, and it is completely engrossing for the first few chapters. De Grazia discusses the sticky issues surrounding leisure and slavery in a society, and outlines a history of how we have been gradually progressing &quot;toward the work society.&quot;<br />This could easily have been a book in itself. Unfortunately, the book begins to drag later on. It gets bogged down in details and hard to follow arguments that contrast strongly with the book's beginning. There is, nonetheless, plenty to sink one's teeth into as the book's pace slows (the pace never stops, and it never becomes outright boring, it just doesn't maintain its momentum).<br />You will not get answers to any difficult questions in this book. What you will get is insight into the issues raised. In short, it is a rewarding but arduous read.	2002-10-26

This book not only has a lot of important names in it (I won't repeat them here), it also has letters from people of lower ranks, or townsfolk. You not only get to know what the generals and officers were thinking, but you also get to know what the people in the soon-to-be United States were doing and thinking. There is an incredible diary from a 14 year old girl included in the collection. She recounts the officers who were quartering in her home and what she thought of them and what she thought in general. Her original orthography is preserved as much as possible. Also included are various diaries of people who lived in the areas where battles or troop movements were taking place. Much insight into what life must have been like during the Revolution can be gleaned from these. There are also glimpses of the violence of warfare in those days through the letters and diaries of the people who were surrounded by it.<br />This collection is made doubly valuable by its comprehensiveness. You'll read the big names, but also quite a bit of the lesser known ones. Each author also has a biography which can be referenced in an appendix of notes, so you know what happened to them. An amazing collection of the famous and the not so famous of the American Revolution.	2002-10-26

If you're looking for a narrative of the struggles between the various native tribes of North America and european settlers, there probably isn't a better place to go.<br />I read this book on my way to Wounded Knee this summer. There was so much I didn't know about the expansion of the United States (and much I still don't know, I'm sure) that my mouth gaped with horror throughout every chapter. The account of how the very laid back friendly tribes of California were mowed down by settlers without a second thought was particularly chilling. As the book itself says, no one remembers these tribes of California because they didn't put up a fight. They were simply swept aside.<br />Reading this book also filled gaps in the stories I had heard: Crazy Horse, Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, The Trail of Tears, the Lakota Uprising, Little Big Horn and of course Wounded Knee. All of these and other stories you probably haven't heard before are put together in chronological order. It is a very comprehensive and readable book, but it does tell of an unreconcilable tragedy.<br />When I finished this book, one day before arriving at Wounded Knee, I was overcome with the feeling that europeans can never make up for what they did to the people who were here before them. What happened is forever unreconcilable. But self-flagellation and reproach will not undo anything, nor help either side as they currently stand. What most european descendants can do is read this book to know what happened, and then visit Wounded Knee to see where it all ended and observe. Only then will one be on the road to understanding, as inevitably incomplete as that understanding must be and remain.	2002-10-26

An incredible book that describes a few horrific cultures of dictatorship that will hopefully be forever unrecognizable to people in the United States. The most fascinating parts of the book are the theories of how the dicatorships came to be (the Tupamaros in Uruguay and the backlash of the military, etc.); even more incredible is how the leaders of the respective dictatorships stayed in power out of necessary compromises with the government(some are still in power, which will be difficult  to swallow after reading this book). It is, in the end, a hopeful book with a warning: &quot;&iexcl;Nunca m&aacute;s!&quot; The book asks &quot;how do you come to terms with those that tortured?&quot; (especially in the incredible situation of passing someone who tortured you in the street, described by someone in the book) Another point the author makes is that there can be forgiveness after such horror, and if there's not there may just be more torture. A very worthwhile read, but not for the squeamish.<br />Lastly, the book provides a good introduction to a much neglected country: Uruguay. There are very few accounts in English of Uruguay, and this is probably the best I've seen. I have also visited Uruguay; it is a fascinating country and well worth a visit. You get a real appreciation for the friendliness of the people after reading what a lot of them went through during &quot;la dictadura.&quot;	2002-10-24

A little '%' with a flashing cursor. I don't remember how long I stared at the little prompt not knowing what to do. Then I pressed some keys and things became much worse.<br />Now I'm surfing around dizzying hierarchies of file structures, able to get to the root and back again and make and edit text files. I bite my thumb at weird commands that used to seem as comprehensible as medieval scholasticism.<br />I wouldn't have been able to accomplish any of that without this little book that's as intimidating as a ladybug.<br />The most difficult part of the book, in fact, is actually finding a UNIX environment to log into. If you're not at a University or a fairly good-sized corporation (and if you don't know UNIX they won't let you near a command line anyway) you may wonder where to go. Linux, in most cases, is a good substitute; or check the web for free UNIX (or Linux) shell accounts. Combine your new-found account with this book and UNIX will no longer be a gut-wrenching incomprehensible monolith.<br />Don't consider yourself an expert, however, and don't stop there. UNIX may not be as difficult as some like to think it is, but it's also not easily mastered. Take this book, digest it, then move on to bigger tomes (there is no shortage of tomes in the land of UNIX, as you will find).<br />Lastly, the owl on the cover rules.	2002-10-22

There is much to learn from this book if you are a complete neophyte to Flash and would rather read a colorful cartoony book than grope through Macromedia's dry monofont manual. This book will have you making cartoons very quickly (maybe not ones to brag about, but good beginnings nonetheless). You will NOT get a solid foundation in Flash overall. This isn't a replacement for the manual or a thicker more in-depth book; think of it more as a colorful supplement. If you have any in-depth knowledge of Flash you should avoid it completely (this may be moot anyway with Flash MX now shining the shelves, which brings up another point: make sure that you have Flash 5 before buying this book: you'll be very frustrated if you have Flash 3, 4 or Flash MX; luckily the title spells it out).<br />The book introduces you to Flash's toolbox and stage area, and teaches you some tricks for putting together characters, saving memory to avoid jittery playback, symbols, buttons and very very introductory material on sound and action script. Each section is laid out for a beginner, and there are very few things that would be considered advanced.<br />Overall, the book shines most on the technical, how-to-use aspects of Flash. The sections on the theory of cartooning are less helpful and almost too perfunctory to provide much guidance or inspiration.<br />In short, if you're impatient and want to start making colorful blocks fly across the screen RIGHT NOW then this is the book for you. You will have to later obtain more advanced and in-depth books to fill in the gaps this book leaves. Nonetheless, it is a great place to start.	2002-10-22

I couldn't be happier that the Library of America has released Paul Bowles' three best novels (he only wrote four) in one volume. Previously they were only available in not-so-easy to find small press editions. Hopefully this edition will make them readily available to a wider audience in volume and time.<br />The most striking thing about Bowles' work is its pace. It moves at a mesmerizing rate. The language is fairly simple but it plods along with a suspensful tension that never lets up even after a climatic moment. It is the kind of fiction to read next to a fountain in a courtyard.<br />Bowles' characters are almost always out of place, or are where they shouldn't be, or where they think they should be. They become engulfed by cultures that they don't understand not through stupidity or banality but often through the natural course of clashing cultures. Reading the books can give you a feeling of getting lost, and overcome with a feeling that you  don't belong, or that you're delving into worlds you aren't prepared to delve into. This is the terror that underlies nearly all of his writing. They are cautionary tales, and they have become more relevant in the past few years since Bowles' death in 1999 (not highly publicized), and the rising relevance of Islam in and to the West.<br />Bowles is one of the first western writers of fiction that treats Islam equally to European society. Islam is not merely a backdrop in which his characters find fault or get ground up in (i.e., you never get the sense that Bowles is blaming the cultures themselves for the destruction of his characters, typically they are responsible, but it really isn't anybody's 'fault' per se). This is multicultural literature at its best, because it allows nastiness and goodness on all sides. Bowles is not afraid to show the dark sides of Islamic and  European cultures side by side, while allowing positive aspects a place as well. He is also never racist towards either side, though some critics have accussed him of this (wrongly, in my opinion).<br />Bowles is an eye-opener. All three of these novels will make an impact on you and make you think about things you've never thought of before. Thanks again to the Library of America for releasing this collection. Buy it and read it.e accussed him of this (wrongly, in my opinion).<br />Bowles is an eye-opener.

This is a great book if you're curious about the basics of the life of a particular pontiff, or about papal statistics (i.e., shortest reign, longest reign, dates of reigns, etc.). It is not a history, and does not advertise to be one. It is a reference book from which history can be extracted (there are sections on papal history and the book is divided up into sections or epochs). You can literally pull up the name of a pope and get a glimpse of what his rule was like, as well as the highlights and relevant dates for each pope.<br />This book was perfect for me, coming from a non-catholic background. Since it does not read like a book laden with catholicism, I wasn't turned away by the language or structure of the book. Not once did I feel the author was trying to proselytize me (something sadly lacking in some other books about the catholic church). What I found was an honest, objective look at the papacy: there have clearly been good and bad popes (some, though very few, have been downright loathsome people), and there have been popes who were incredible men. This book is honest in its appraisal of the men who held the highest earthly order of the catholic church.<br />There is a slant, and the author hits you in the face with it, but not until the very end of the book. It is not laced throughout the text. Depending upon your perspective, it will either horribly offend you or surprise you with its candor. I personally found it refreshing.<br />In short, if you're curious about the papacy from a historical perspective, this is a good place to start.	2002-09-09
