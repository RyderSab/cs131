Peter Matthiessen engrossingly tells the life history of many of the North American species, including segmentation of habitat during the seasons, and wonders of migration.  Along the way he introduces ecological principles as Bergman's Rule and evolutionary ideas of speciation (how did Western and Semipalmated sandpipers separate?).<br /><br />Since the initial publishing of this book and the forward (in 1994), the optimism of recovery of species may be diminished, as many are declining.  The illustrations are all well done, and Matthiessen introduces each chapter with literary quotes, such as Shakespeare's \\"sometimes I'll get the young scamels (bar-tailed godwit) from the rock\\".  Readers of this would probably enjoy \\" The Flight of the Red Knot\\" by Brian Harrington and Charles Flowers.	2005-03-30

Even the footnotes may be humorous (\\"FP sometimes gets carried away in his fervent reverence for his own books\\").  With 26 vignettes, only one of them uses mathematical symbols.  This presents the sort of scenarios, that you may actually encounter such as Round-robin tournaments, life tables, and of course gambling.  The chapter on \\"Was the 1970 draft lottery fair?\\" may have had personal consequences for some readers.  The topics fall into categories of; making decisions, sampling, learning from data, and estimating probabilities.  There are some  common ideas about how more information can be obtained, from samples,  Throughout the book, some of the ideas seem to be \\"common sense\\", while others are counter intuitive, and need further thinking, and working the problems helps.  Readers of this might also enjoy \\"How to Lie with Statistics\\" by Darrell Huff  and \\"A mathematicians reads the newspaper\\" by John Allen Paulos.	2005-03-28

I can't speak of the quality of the translations but the poems are superb.  Written after being diagnosed with cancer, these poems offer a certain decision to live (\\"Now and then, I am happy!\\"), and a certain freedom.  There is a poem of the Ostrogodo family that \\"spoke so often of the dead  ...  that a strange thing happened\\"., of \\"a naked man who lived for many long years\\", \\"a poem of lightening and of disasters of raining ash\\", of \\"dismantled Cervantes\\", and a life in the suburbs.

These are stories with rich smells, and I can almost smell the chalah bread, and taste the kreplach and macaroons.  Set in shtetl, (small communities of Eastern European Jews), there is a conflict of traditional culture and modern Jewish practice.<br /><br />Not only are there stories of golem, dybbuks, and demons, but even more earthy people as Dr. Fischelson who marries a woman known as Black Dobbe.  There is a devil manipulating two perpetual liars, the flamboyant Glicka Genedel, and Reb Yomtom.

He starts the history of mysticism with Ezekiel, and includes both German Hasidism and Safed on the Galilee.  His inclusion of interpreted text from Zohar was revealing as well as Lekha Dodi, and I would have liked more such passages.<br /><br />On \\"The Character of Jewish Mysticism\\" he states \\"Before there is mysticism, there is religion\\".  But another view is that the individual experience does not require faith or knowledge.  Being a book, perhaps he also does not emphasize the Oral tradition enough.  The discussion on Sefirot, and \\"calculus\\" of the divine world, was difficult, but that difficulty may have been mine; with concepts of emanation as \\"self-contraction\\" or \\"man is conceived as a structure parallel to and analogous with the Sefirot\\".  Ariel also continues with the metaphor of the \\"human soul upward toward the heavens\\", but Rabbi Albert Green has presented a metaphor of Jewish mysticism as inward.  I appreciated the references to Isaac Bashevis Singer, and will read some of his works.  Since the writing of this book (1988) there has been a more popular appeal, and I have heard that Jewish mysticism is now taught in rabbinical school.	2005-03-04

We may view old postcards as nostalgic (for a history that never was), but when printed the card often pictured the latest thing. Being English, there are many Winston Churchill cards (as early as 1908), Prince Charles, the Queen, and Margaret Thatcher.  There are plenty of cards for Americans, and a 1960 Nixon card is a favorite, as well as the original Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1947.  In each year, a card from Piccadilly Circus and the New York skyline are included, as well as 10-15 other subjects.  The cards reflect the changes of the time but also constancy, and many of the old jokes and statuesque women are recycled in each decade.<br /><br />Tom Phillip's artist eye is really used. Phillips commentary of each card is informative, sometimes humorous, sometimes irreverent, but always interesting and range from comments on punk fashion to statement about Kierkegaard liking a joke on a cow card.  His pairing of cards is also enlightening: e.g. the King's head dress in 1935 is printed next to a Fiji headhunter head dress. A person's cards selection may be a Rorschach test, and I don't know what the fascination with camels (4 cards) tells us about this author.  No matter what your interest or home, there are certainly cards to delight you here.  A 1996 card of spaceships over St. Louis was a personal favorite.<br /><br />This book goes a long way in making the case that this was the golden century of postcards.  I can't imagine a book in 2099 with a similar collection, or a printing of emails.  Phillips includes the writing on the cards also, and these also reflect the times and a certain concise but revealing formula.  Those who enjoyed the messages of these cards would also enjoy Robert Butler's book \\" Had a Good Time: Stories from American Postcards	2005-03-03

If you'd like to know the origin of that expression, it's in this book.  Using the vehicle of questions that have occurred to many of us, Desmond Morris, reveals a lot about house cat behavior.  The questions range from \\"Why does a cat chatter when it sees a bird\\"; \\"How does a cat use its whiskers\\", and \\"Why does a cat sneer\\".  Along the way are some fascinating facts; such as a difference in feather plucking behavior in New and Old World cats, and the ear markings (for example of tigers) as a means of enhancing signaling form the ears.  Morris may be forgiven for a few presumptions about cat motives (particularly with respect to humans).	2005-02-25

It is also striking the variety of occupations of those selecting the poems; there are construction workers, attorneys, soldiers, investment managers, and even a poet (Stanley Kunitz).	2005-02-25

As Merton says \\"As soon as any thought stimulated your mind or your heart you can put the book down because your meditation has begun\\".  Some of the selections and categorization of paragraphs may seem contrived, but the strength of this book is the strong and often poetic paragraphs (for example \\"Every blade of grass is an angel singing in a shower of glory\\").  Merton continues to provoke controversy in the Catholic Church, and was recently taken out of a new Roman Catholic handbook on church teachings. Some of the conservative critics are against the monk's later exploration of Buddhism, but the selections in this book clearly show there was never any question of Merton losing faith.  The editor Robert Ichausti has selected various paragraphs from Thomas Merton's writings, and organized them topically.<br /><br />The first section \\"The Real and False Selves\\" states radical need.<br /><br />\\"If we follow nothing but our natures, our own philosophies, our own level of ethics, we will end up in hell\\".  His understanding of the shadow self, reminded me of Jung.<br /><br />The second section \\"The World we live on\\", has thoughts about science and technology.  Reading this in Louisville, I was struck by \\"Compare our monastery and the General Electric plant in Louisville.  Which one is more serious and more \\"religious\\" institution?\\".  Some of these paragraphs are influenced by Albert Camus and \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\".<br /><br /> The longest section on \\"Antidotes to Illusion\\" has meditations on truth, silence, prayer, and humility.  Here is presented and utmost respect for silence \\"But there is no true intimacy between souls who do not know how to respect one another's solitude\\".  There are paragraphs seemingly influenced by Kierkegaard.  There is humility and \\"We must approach our meditation realizing that \\"grace\\", \\"mercy\\", and \\"faith\\" ... \\"are constantly renewed gifts\\".  You will also be introduced to St. Benedict Joseph Labre, who lived a life of humility and poverty.  Finally, I leave you with Merton's own admonition \\"Dance in this sun, you tepid idiot\\".ntly renewed gifts\\".

The book highlights the most collected categories, and the artist-signed chapter covers over 250 pages.  The 900 postcard images, though reduced and in black and white, are useful; my favorites included the Krampus cards, Alligator border card, and the Halloween cards are a real treat.  Mashburn provides short biographies of some of the artists and publishers (and even an introduction to Krampus).  Although Mashburn does present some useful guidelines on topical, views, and roadside America I thought those chapters were too short in light of the vast number of cards available.

Jackman presents one educated soldier's often daily proceedings, as they \\"overturn the best government in the world\\".  The entries have a real style, often humorous, with little politics, hate, or even personal feelings.  Jackman and this Kentucky \\"orphan brigade\\" saw a lot of action in his 3 years, 8 months and 4 days of service; including the Battle of Shiloh in 1862, the blasting of Vicksburg, and Chickamauga and Chattanooga.  His group also tried to fend of Sherman's march.  On June 14, 1864 a shell fell him till he was out of action, till he joined \\"the orphans\\" to see \\"Uncle Jeff' (confederate president Jefferson Davis), in Washington, Georgia as the president rode away alone --- \\"and the confederate government ceases to exist\\".<br /><br />Jackman's journal was ever present and, as you might expect, there is a focus on food, with talk of getting \\"bear\\" (local livestock)\\", or going off for watermelon and bacon in the morning.  Sickness was common for Jackman, and he writes of the pain of new shoes.  Jackman's style is often light even in the midst of war, for example, \\"I fell to my lot to be mounted behind a very large man on a very small horse\\".  He read when books were available, including Cicero (in Latin) and Dickens \\"Great Expectations\\".  Relevant to today, the soldiers in the confederate army also complained of having their time involuntarily extended.  The editor did not over edit the account and the  introduction in each chapter was helpful. Including a map would have helped me follow the story.	2005-01-10

The expected hero's are here like Jefferson, Lincoln, and Robert Frost, but so are the uniquely American villains like Al Capone and Jesse James.  Each of the 160 full page portraits is preceded by a paragraph giving a brief biography, and, more interestingly, a quote by the person portrayed or a revealing paragraph from another American figure.  For example for Al Capone he states \\"I've been spending the best years of my life as a public benefactor.  I've given people the light pleasures, shown them a good time\\".  These characters are often interrelated, as Thomas Jefferson talks of John Adams, and Emerson writes in his journals about Daniel Webster.  The arts are well represented also, and America's contributions to music include portraits of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, W.C Handy, and George Gershwin (in a unique self portrait).  This book also gives a glimpse of the history of portraiture including paintings, daguerreotypes, and photographs.  In the case of Matthew Brady, there are both photographs by him, and of him.

The image of the Red Admiral butterfly flutters through, starting with the titled poem, through the reflections/essays \\"In Panama\\" and in the section on ten thousand wing beats.  There are occasional church references, as the \\"Church of the Last years fallen leaves\\" the \\"Church of Doubting Thomas\\", a synod of crows, and a light redeeming the woods.  Light and illumination also bends across the poems with a \\"silver hour\\", or days in November \\"the color and heft of lead\\", and the \\"bendable light\\" of the poem Koan.  Dana takes risks with the poems, as he tries to \\"push past himself\\" into different styles of thought.  The final section of the book marks his departure, perhaps emulating the red admiral butterfly, constantly improvising its strokes.  Many of these newer poems work but some seem \\"confounding\\" as the cover jacket states.	2005-01-10

These twelve puzzles are largely without violence and in similar format; the evening begins with drinks and good-natured (?) abuse among the six gentlemen.  After dinner, the invited guest is grilled starting with the question \\"How do you justify your existence\\".  Invariably a mystery presents itself, which the diners probe, and then it is the water Henry who offers the key point of the solution.  The fun of these stories is the inventiveness of the problems.  Only a writer as broad as Asimov could combine the math of Goldbach's conjecture and the poetry of Milton in a single story.  I also enjoyed the self-depredation in \\"The Phoenician Bauble\\" where Asimov is referred to as \\"Asimov? Isn't he Manny's friend, the one even more stuck on himself than Manny?\\".  Two of the stories do not follow the exact format: in \\"The Good Samaritan\\", a woman (normally not allowed) presents her case (but is not allowed in for dinner), and in \\"The Intrusion\\" a man bursts in uninvited.<br /><br />I enjoyed Asimov's afterwards in each story, where he talks about editors, titles, and after \\"the redhead\\" admits he dreamed the story.  So listen to all the clues, try to solve it, but then failing that (I think I only guessed two), listen to Henry the waiter as he solves it.	2005-01-10

The selections from the novelists such as Dostoevsky, Hesse, Camus, Becket and Saul Bellow capture the tone best for me.  Although the more philosophical writings of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Sartre are all fairly readable, the selections from Heidegger and Jaspers were rough going.  Each author is introduced with a brief background that presents the author in context.<br /><br />Solomon does not define existentialism nor offer a single dogma to the herd.  This is a good thing!  Solomon allows the authors to speak for themselves, and nothing more should be expected of this most individualistic of philosophies.  Contrasted to Nietzsche's \\"God is Dead\\", Existentialism is not necessarily atheistic, as the inclusion of Kierkegaard, Marcel, Dostoevsky, Buber, and Tillich illustrate. Existentialism is nothing if it doesn't emphasize individual existence, so make the choice to stop reading this review, and read the book and write your own review!	2004-12-08

Heyken gives a brief history of the chess world champions (through 1996) and this gives a taste of the individuals whose games you will see later in the book. The rules, and moves of the pieces are quickly introduced, and unique section entitled \\"If Chess Pieces Could Talk\\" gives a humorous perspective on the strengths of the pieces.  The meat of the book is in looking at strategies and six complete games are played through along with analysis of the strength of key moves.  There are ample diagrams included, and I found it helpful to play along on an actual chess board.<br /><br />Don't neglect the 20 exercises included in the 3 tests.

It is generally lighthearted (but I sure wouldn't agree that Dostoevsky and Hesse are unreadable unless you're a teenager).  Perhaps a few more \\"minutes\\" could have been spent on his key philosophical concepts, with just 2 pages on \\"The Will To Power\\", and three on \\"The Superman\\".  Since Nietzsche wrote in aphorisms he would seem to be ideal for an abbreviated work, but his ideas do not come through here.  Readers of this may enjoy his short piece \\"The Madman\\".  I think more post-WW II or post-modern treatment of Nietzsche would have been helpful.  Favorite quote from the book \\"Beware of syphilitics preaching morals\\" - Saul Bellow, Herzog.  A few quotes not included in the book:<br /><br />\\"That which does not kill you makes you stronger\\".<br /><br />\\"The time for petty politics is over: the very next century will bring the fight for dominion of the earth - the compulsion of large-scale politics\\".<br /><br />\\"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster.

The sections on life history include great pictures such as feeding young in the nest, and a fledgling flapping to try to get off the ground.  My favorite section was on the mockingbird in American Culture, and early mentions to the mockingbird include William Bartam's trip through the south east, James Fennimore Cooper, and John Burroughs.

There are occasional anthropomorphisms, such as \\"ospreys are relatively taciturn as they go about the business of providing for their family\\".

This book focuses on the religions of India, Asia, and \\"The Religions of Abraham\\" (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam).  Each religion is discussed with many 2-4 page sections discussing a particular topic, and including a few pictures, and side bars for quotes.  This format lends it self well to introducing a diverse set of personages, but it also prevents a smoothly flowing narrative, so at times the book seems to bounce around.  The chaotic effect is not without some merit, and if nothing else, you get an appreciation for the breadth of experiences.  In the section on India, the introduction of name, upon name of different Gods, becomes overwhelming,<br /><br />The breadth of the book is impressive, and the inclusion of poetry, throughout was useful.  The photos throughout the book are impressive, and almost as much as the text lend an experiential flavor.  Sometimes the book tries to be too biographical, rather than emphasizing concepts.  Particularly lacking however, was an introduction of African, Native American, and Latin American expressions of God.  He does included Buddhism however, which does not really have a clear notion of God.	2004-10-10

Despite the title I think the earliest card (postal card) included is around 1876 and the latest card is around 1937 of Bowman field.  The books forward provides a one page history of post cards, which would be helpful to the beginning collector, as well as the warning of incorrect names and addresses printed on the cards.  The scope of this collection is impressive, and I suspect it probably just scratches the surface of his collection, at one point he mentions that he has 21 different postcards of the Fontaine Ferry park.  What really makes this book useful for both the historian and the postcard collectors is the short paragraph associated with each card that describes the current use of each place pictured. It's kind of sad to see that many of the landmarks of the turn of the century are now parking lots.  I think I particularly enjoyed some of the scenes around the Ohio, such as the ferryboats between Louisville and Jeffersonville.  Some of the excitements at the Louisville Armory included the National Bowling Tournament (1906), and the Greater Louisville Exposition (1907).  Horse Racing fans may particularly enjoy the picture of the Louisville Jockey Club (Churchill downs) in 1905 before the Twin Towers were built.	2004-10-10

The \\"golden age\\" of postcards perhaps lasted from 1898 to 1912, and in one year alone (1907) the Post Office delivered over 600 million cards (and the population was only 80 million).  It is for traces of this era that Robert Butler has scoured the antique malls and postcard shows, looking for remarkable messages to craft his stories around.<br /><br />The stories work well because Butler is historically accurate and the voices behind the stories seem (usually) authentic.  Some of the stories revolve around simple, but pivotal events.  The most humorous is, \\"The Ironworker's Hayride\\" and I had the pleasure of hearing Robert Butler read this and the audience was roaring in laughter.  The stories are sometimes about the historic events of the era, for example the real photograph postcards and stories from \\"Woody Wilson's little escape in Vera Cruz\\" or \\"Mother in the trenches\\" of World War I.  And in \\"Twins\\", for an immigrant to the United States trachoma was a real concern and a traveler on the White Star Line certainly would have thought about the Titanic.  Perhaps some of the voices edge toward stereotype (for example \\"Uncle Andrew), but most resonate as clear individuals.	2004-10-10

Maybe your interested in the biggest ball of twine (several states boast of this), or miniature models of towns.  Each of the fifty states is introduced by a \\"Greeting from\\" postcard (but at less than 1 1/2\\" by 2 1/4\\" I wish these would have been bigger).  The appendix identifies many of these from Curt Teich Postcard Archives that collectors will recognize.  There are pictures of unique hotels, cottage courts, and such as \\"Wigwam village\\", and I would have enjoyed having these pictures/cards dated.  Readers of this will also enjoy his Motel Americana web site.	2004-10-10

I recognized (too) many problems in our warehouse project and the advice offered was helpful.  The book is evenly divided into \\"impossible management situations\\" and \\"impossible technical situations\\".  Ninety-one problems are presented, with common themes including tension between operational data and the warehouse, lack of clear business sponsor and clear requirements, use of consultants, lack of sharing of data and stovepipes, and quality issues in both the warehouse and the source operational data.  Each problem is asked of the nine experts and the answers have a lot of redundancy, and occasionally interesting disagreements.  In some cases I would have preferred the editor either integrating the answers or allowing a dialogue between the experts.  This book does not present an introduction to data warehousing, and is most geared toward the data warehouse project manager.	2004-10-06

For example, instead or rewarding those who find major quality problems, change the culture to provide quality early in the process.  His chapter on \\"assessing data definition\\" quality is an important step often neglected.  For example, some of us are may be using minimal metadata (perhaps federally mandated standards) that are inadequate for true enterprise wide data definition.  The examples included in the book (particularly in \\"High costs of low quality data\\") are instructive, and show how someone saturated with thinking about quality (like Larry English), views such simple things as getting a fax at a hotel.  If you are planning a data warehouse, this book might fit nicely into the  \\"Enterprise Infrastructure Evaluation\\" phase in Moss and Atre's \\"Business Intelligence Roadmap\\" terminology.<br /><br />I would have liked more specific methods of detecting low quality in the section on information quality assessment.  The final third of the book, on establishing the information quality environment, provides good direction, but seems too optimistic.  How does a single database analyst change a corporate culture and how does a small warehouse group influence the quality processes of hundreds of diverse data sources?  This is a good, thought-provoking book.	2004-10-01

Ray Bradbury traces his Martian Chronicles to reading these as a child.  This is high on action and around every turn there is a life-threatening event across the Barsoom landscape. John Carter  \\"the prince of Helium\\" must fight with his beloved \\"pet\\" Woola, \\"As large as a Shetland pony, with hideous head and frightful fangs, he was indeed an awesome spectacle, as he crept after me on his ten short, muscular legs; but to me he was the embodiment of love and loyalty\\". One review called John Carter  \\"a natural man\\", which seems appropriate.  There is the undying love for Dejah Thorus and the final sly \\"Why not?\\" as he draws her close after the triumphs.  Carter is a man of courage, and that word spoken from an unknown ally, leads him out of the tortuous Pit of Plenty.  This might be considered the third of the trilogy started with \\"A Princes of Mars\\" and continued with \\"The Gods of Mars\\", but in fact there were 7 more John Carter stories.	2004-09-23

This book provides a good introduction to poetic forms such as the villanelle, sestina, or sonnet.  Included is a description of the exact topology of the form, a history of the form, and the contemporary use of the form.  The first or second poem under each chapter, usually follows the classic model of the form, and allowed me to understand the mechanics.  The anthology of poems chronologically ranged from the classic (and who would dare discuss sonnets without including one from Shakespeare), to more modern poets as Gwendolyn Brooks.  In most of the verse forms, there is a close-up view of one of the poets selected in that section, but for some reason that good idea was discontinued when discussing \\"shaping forms\\" (elegy, pastoral, and ode).  The chapter on Meter is only two pages long, so it is disappointing that at least some examples weren't included here.  The final section of \\"Open Forms\\" perhaps allows one to reach their own conclusions about the use of form, and what constitutes memorable poetry.  No matter what, an appreciation of form should help your appreciation of poetry.  I would have also appreciated a little more in depth analysis of a few of the poems to show how the form was used to convey the poet's message.	2004-09-19

Published in 1999, Adams should be congratulated for including modern artists such as the Marsalis brothers, Courtney Pine, and Cassandra Wilson. The inclusion of short discographies entitled &quot;All that Jazz&quot; should help anyone to find CD's to listen to. There are some great photographs such as Coleman Hawkins playing alongside Miles Davis, or Chick Web at the drums, and perhaps a few poor choices (Diana Ross as Billy Holiday).<br /><br /> There are a few annoyances in this book. The small font, particularly on the timeline is hard to read against the peach color background. Sometimes he tries a little too hard, calling the musicians in each era &quot;Hip-cats&quot;, or emphasizing sex as a root of the music. I'm not sure Sun Ra, would have viewed himself in a comic or vaudeville light either. I would recommend John Fordham's &quot;Jazz&quot; before this book.	2004-08-04

There are a few of the old Bester touches, such as spacing of text on the page, and an animal called an &quot;Astroboar&quot; that was breed for no fat, but escaped and evolved into a mammoth like creature. As a plot it may not be very compelling, but there a few humorous twists such as a circus street parade, and a pet cat that reads people's psychic dots.

The pictures included in the timelines are remarkable, such as Louis Armstrong first cornet, or a program cover from the 1949 Paris Jazz festival. The book, published in 1993, includes history through 1989, and includes such people as Wynton Marsalis, Keith Jarrett, and Brit Courtney Pine.  The jazz giants section gives a little more history of key figures, and features some great pictures as Miles and Bird together, or Lester Young sitting back with pork pie hat. The gallery of classic recording could fuel anyone's collection for years, and many have been re-released on CD now.<br /><br />I am not a musician but the section on the anatomy of instruments, provides a good introduction to such things as circular breathing on the saxophone or walking on the bass.  I would have gotten more out of the techniques if I could read music, but was still useful in explaining such things as modal harmony, and even jazz dance.	2004-08-02

Daniel Botkin starts with an exposition on the rate of change, and what would be considered benign. Stephen Jay Gould made a career at promoting a view of &quot;quirky, punctuated change&quot; of evolution that is not a gentle process. Sometimes the long view present a different view on our environmental problems as William Meson essay on Global Synergies, and the coming together of continents of Pangaea, are warnings to us of the role of exotic species. The human role in the change on earth is also discussed and perhaps the article on the Masia on Kenya's wildlife highlighted the need to not always take a western view. Some of the articles border on the profane, and perhaps the study of change is the purview of Buddhist, and the essay on learning from the Ladahk people of Tibetan plateau may be the most explicit of that.<br /><br /> The photographs are striking, and not always beautiful (as a burying beetle on the chest of a dead mourning dove). . The stone carving of the giraffe in the Sahara recall a distant lush past. The photographs of ritual of earth, are some of the most touching.	2004-08-02

There is a feeling of flowing water with many water allegories, not just from the River Darro but even include the Allhambra Palace (the fortress from 1239) has its own flow (&quot;to be alone with the breeze that comes from old hills of the Allhambra&quot;).

Electricity was really in the air, and Americans were fascinated with this new invention.  Cars too were a novelty and the parade of 122 must have been quite a site.  Witherspoon, offers a short but lively illustrated  (over 100 pictures) history including the start of the fair, pictures of the buildings, and finally the still visible remains of the fair.  In this the 100 year anniversary of the fair, this is a great book to catch the spirit again!  Today while walking down Lindell avenue, I thought how grand it must be along the &quot;Pike&quot; and taste ice cream cones, hot dogs and ice tea for the first time.  There are still Fair delights as the Art Museum and Brookings Hall and Francis Field (Site of first US Olympics) at Washington University.  This short book does not always give a social context, for example Scott Joplin's ragtime was considered too racial for the main fare, where John Phillip Sousa presided, but only so much material can be covered.  The final two pages comparing the map of the fair with the present-day Park and Campus is great!	2004-06-10

He talks about the emotion of writing about people he knows; how easy it is to write about his brother, and difficult to write about his mother.

The Gloria Scott may be the start of Holmes career as consulting detective, and in these Memoirs we also have the introduction of brother Mycroft.  The annotation by Leslie Klinger on this edition is superb, with diversions into the constant problem of train timetables (Did Watson purposely obscure these facts?).  I was interested in her annotation of the difference between American and English editions (for example in &quot;Yellow face&quot; the longer time that Grant Munro was silent in the American Edition was &quot;presumably because inter-racial marriage was unacceptable in America in the 1890's&quot;). The footnotes always help to place the stories in context (for example what is &quot;brain-fever&quot; suffered in 7 of the Holmes stories?) and also detect inconsistencies in Watson's telling.  Perhaps my favorite footnote is in &quot;The Yellow Face&quot; stating that actor William Gillette may have been to the Holmes household and met the page &quot;Billy&quot; (Who was played by Charlie Chaplin in 1903!).

Through his journal entries from the mid 1970's naturalist Jim Gilberts presents the timing of many natural events primarily in Carver County in southern Minnesota.  For many notable occurrences (such as the first red-winged blackbird) he presents the dates when he first saw the phenomena for 10-15 years or may compare the timing in northern and southern Minnesota (for example he lists the ice out dates in 20 Minnesota lakes).  The entries work best when he is talking about what he has seen directly, and perhaps are a little dryly encyclopedic when he is giving some background information.  In January is the excitement of seeing snow fleas and white frost covering every twig.  March may be his favorite month and his interest turns to the first ants on the sidewalks and first red-winged blackbirds.  He talks both about wild and agricultural occurrences such as the first garden strawberries or alfalfa hay cutting in June.  Fall offers colors and hawk migration in Duluth, but frost is nearby. This book is generously illustrated with over a dozen color photographs for each month!

Deploying a portal so \\"users check their email from the web or read the latest company press release\\" is not enough!  The common goal is enterprise wide integration.  The chapter on Return of Investment (ROI) presents how to make the ROI calculation and more importantly emphasizes business justification of the portal.

The case studies presented and associated best practices were all useful but perhaps I would have enjoyed some examples of failures.. there must be a lot out there!<br />Data warehouse architecture is a huge topic (see for example books by Ralph Kimball), but this book introduces how portals can be delivery vehicle for \\"business intelligence\\" reporting (through ad hoc query tools, dashboards, and visualizations tools).  Sullivan also discusses e-commerce portals, collaboration portals, and portals with unstructured and \\"tacit knowledge\\".

Starting with the business justification of the project, Moss and Atre emphasize requirements, metadata, and extraction/transformation/ and load.  In each chapter is a good overview, things to consider, relation to other steps of the plan, and a clear list of deliverables and the personnel (the roles) involved in each of the steps.  Each chapter also offers rules of thumb that could only have been come from someone experienced with setting up a Business Intelligence Solution.  Perhaps most important to a project manager tempted to cut out a step, is a warning about the risk of omitting the step.<br />Each chapter should NOT be thought of as an in-depth analysis of the topic (for example, there are just 4 pages discussing the star versus the snowflake schema when discussing database design), but rather as a map of the steps that need to be done.  I was particularly impressed with the metadata discussions, which emphasize testing of the metadata repository, the role of metadata in navigation and context-sensitive-help at the element level, and the use of multiple sources to generate the metadata.  The common emphasis on reviews, involvement of the business sponsors, and testing throughout the process was great!  The discussion on three parallel development tracks seemed optimistic, as I was not sure that the application track is completely independent of the Extraction/transformation/load steps until the final implementation step.  The book probably also should have emphasized security earlier in the process.  This book offers a good plan, and I would be happy if our Business Intelligence projects followed the plan laid out here!!	2004-06-01

The initial drawings weren't primarily ornithological intentioned and started as far back as Egyptian tomb art (with a painting of a retriever cat leaping at a bird). The chapter on illuminated bestiaries of medieval times included a detail from Raphael's tapestry for the Sistine chapel of Rome.  Coming into the 1600's we see the start of engraving for Ornithological purposes with highlight being Ray and Willughby's Ornithologiae libri tres.  Coming into America are pictured Flamingo's by John White and Mark Catesby, the botanist who was one of the first to include backgrounds with bird drawing. From Audubon's Birds of America, are beautiful two-page printings of the bald eagle and mallard.  Perhaps some of the highlights of the book are prints from John Gould's work: with over 3100 hand-colored Lithographics in 43 volumes, there were plenty to choose from but the pair of Australian Rosella's lithographed by H.C. Richter are remarkable.  This book presents a good visual introduction to the ornithological artists, up through the beginning of the 1900's.  Perhaps the book does not go into enough detail about the producing techniques, and the impact of the invention of lithography.  The book concludes with &quot;the Twentieth Century&quot; highlighting the work of Charles Frederick Tunnicliffe and his importance to British Ornithology.  Perhaps in the United States, Roger Tory Peterson could have been included.  If you look online for the Hill Collection at Cornell University you will also see some fine examples from these ornithological illustrators.	2004-05-10

What is striking about the cards is there is never a return address, with Loyal cutting himself off from contact from his family, but still wanting to let them know his whereabouts (with a rack of stolen bear postcards).  I was hoping for some return, or public discovery of the event that precipitated Loyals exodus.  The descriptions of mining and archeology in the west were perhaps the best, but the writing of the farm in Vermont did not reveal as strong feeling of place.  The writing in sometimes very lyrical for example &quot;.. her own house showed up as a slatternly lean of paintless clapboards, the porch slipping away like melting butterscotch&quot;.  The vignettes almost read more like loosely connected short stories, than a novel.  The male characters seem most developed, with the women offering less.

Every walk is different.  As our labyrinth is outside, it offers such experiences as walking the labyrinth with an ant or being scolded by a wren.  The pattern may seem chaotic sometimes, but &quot;You need chaos in your soul to give birth to a dancing star&quot;(Nietzsche).<br />Dr. Artress is both a psychotherapist and a pastor at Grace Cathedral, and offers many personal stories from participants.  Some of these seem fanciful and she leans toward Jung's psychology  (and dismissed Freud in a single sentence &quot;The scientific myth, helped along by Freud, has taught us to trust the outer world&quot;).  Her perspectives on the labyrinth as archetype are important.  She also offers exposure to some mystics such as Julian of Norwich, Teresa of Avila and Hildegard of Bingen.  Perhaps the discussion on the &quot;Feminine&quot; becomes decisive when she talks about Christ as part of the patriarchy.<br />The chapter on basic approaches to walking the labyrinth provides useful methods and will broaden my experience.  Reading the book is fine, but what is most important is the walking (check out the Grace Cathedral's labyrinth locator web site if you don't know where one is).  For those who like a metaphoric view of Labyrinths, Jorge Borges's book Labyrinth offers some fascinating stories.  Dr Artress should be thanks for initiating the Labyrinth Movement.	2004-04-23

The postcard was not invented in a single step, and Staff spends at least half the book on antecedents including the visiting card, trade cards, illustrated headed writing paper, and pictorial envelopes.  In some cases he shows these early works reprinted as postcards.<br />Staff discusses things that we take for granted now, such as being able to send to different counties, and includes important material from those early days such as  Dr. Heinrichs von Stephans proposal for the Germans states, for the use of the &quot;Open post sheet&quot;, and Dr. Herrmann German published paper proposal for postcards.  Also included is the Lipman's Postal Card in the United states as early at 1870.<br />There is an emphasis on British and European cards, and there is no general history of such things as Real Photo or the more recent Linens. With 138 illustrations, there are ample examples of the different postcards.	2004-04-10

A reader of this book, could decide to just understand the general ideas, follow the detailed mathematics, or perhaps program on a computer (for example sorting routines, hashing and the like).  Each of the excursions is well covered, sometimes witty, but at times I got bogged-down in the symbols.  The chapter on \\"analog computation\\" coming in the middle of a book was a welcome relief presenting ideas of sorting, shortest path and minimum trees using spaghetti and strings without mathematics (and would be a good chapter to give to non-computer science friends if they ever make the mistake of asking you what sort of problems you think about).  The chapter on neural networks, I thought was also clear. There are also some of the classic computer science problems presented such as the Tower of Hanoi, or \\"A man ponders how to ferry a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across of river\\".<br /><br />The 66 excursions cover a lot of ground, but often return to Turing machines, finite-state machines, and NP-completeness problems.  I might have enjoyed more on algorithm analysis, computer languages, and game analysis. Additionally there are new topics since this 1992 publication, such as quantum computing, Bioinformatics, Internet related topics  on virus and encrypting, and a raft of social questions including privacy.  I hope the \\"Turing omnibus\\" refuels for another update.	2004-04-10

Some are well written crime mysteries, while other's look at a more general human mystery.  &quot;Smoke&quot; has Stevens employing a theatrical device as clever as Sherlock Holmes (in Scandal in Bohemia) to illicit an end to the mystery.  Monk contains deductions about the &quot;moron&quot; Monk, and what he could or could not do.  The characterizations of the minor characters are all well done.<br />The stories &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Knights Gambit&quot; go beyond conventional crime detection.  Knights Gambit, the longest piece, unfolds around a chessboard, and is more complicated.  With Faulkner's elaborate sentence structure, I had trouble following some of this story.. perhaps a little too mysterious.	2004-04-10

Throughout the book he tries to make you have compassion for the characters.  He states, &quot;it is the whole point of moral education to be able to imagine being in another's position&quot; (and he references John Rawls: A theory of Justice).  For example, in the story of Abraham and Sarah, he tries to imagine Hagar's view not as a vessel, but as a prophet and mother of a nation.  He using his own life experiences, even his divorce, to bring home the point that no one really understands what is happening in another's life.  This is not your Sunday school teacher telling you what the stories mean, but rather insight into the process of discussion and moral development (with reference to Lawrence Kohlberg's moral development levels.<br />Much of the book focuses on Abraham and Sarah. Perhaps the story of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac, begs the problem of ethical interpretation of God's action, and he references Kierkegaard's teleological suspension of the ethical.  These few chapters in Genesis offer many ethical dilemmas, and this book would probably be best in a discussion group.  Readers of this would also like Bill Moyer's video discussion \\"Genesis: A living conversation\\" (Visotzky is in that as well) as well as Moyer's book \\"Talking about Genesis\\".	2004-04-10

For example in Western Philosophy, Karl Marx gets one paragraph.  This book should not be thought of a history or catalog of philosophers, but rather as a sampling from different cultures.  A different author writes each of the 7 chapters, but most contain a glossary, further reading, and thought provoking study questions.  I thought the chapter on American Indian Philosophy by J. Baird Callicot and Thomas Overholt was enlightening with selections from Ojibwa and Lakota.  The thought that an ancient American crisis after the extinction of the megafauna, precipitating the American Indian environmental ethic was a new idea to me.<br />At times the distinction between philosophy and religion was a little blurred.  There was little discussion of uniquely Islamic or Jewish philosophy (despite a paragraph on Maimonides).  The focus of each chapter depended upon the author, so the Japanese Philosophy focused on Zen, while perhaps the other Buddhist philosophies are short changed.<br />I used this book of readings as a good accompaniment to Dr. Higgins teaching company audiotape of World Philosophy.	2004-03-10

And having written this, I am worthy of a blow, and perhaps you the reader of this review another blow, for there are many blows from the master to the student here.  So don't place to much credence on the words, which are just the shadows. The interweaving of the 3 commentaries, can be humorous, for example Fugai entreats his master Genro &quot;Stop! Stop!  Don't try to pull an unwilling cat over the carpet.\\". Senzaki's commentary places the koan in context.<br />There is also some poetry from Genro, that comments on the Koan -- for example &quot;A cloud rests at the mouth of the cave<br />Doing nothing all day.<br />The moonlight penetrates the waves through the night,<br />But leaves no trace in e water.&quot;<br />Nyogen says &quot;American Zen is running sideways writing books, lecturing, referring to theology, psychology, and what not&quot;.

The story start when the father offers the son, Nachiketas as a sacrifice (reminscent of Abraham and Isaac).  As a compensation of being made to wait for Yama, the God of Death, Nachiketas is granted 3 wishes.<br />This most popular of the Upanished's, is one of the Veda's surviving perhaps 3000 years. This is the gospel of &quot;yajnas&quot; (sacrifices), and the sacrificer offers obligations in the fire.  Nachiketas wishes for understanding of the fire ritual.  The book unfolds, as Yama, satisfying his third wish for special knowledge of death, lays out the paths of life &quot;You can walk the way outward that leads to pleasure or the way inward that leads to grace.&quot;  There is the common Indian image of the chariot, with the self-seating in the back &quot;Think of the reins the driver is holding as the mind&quot;.  Swami Ambikanananda states &quot;This is not a translation for scholars&quot;, but provides a poetic translation for those seeking, for example:<br />&quot; Remember always ~<br />Not with my speech,<br />Not with my eyes,<br />Nor even with my mind<br />Will that Self be reached.<br />It will declare itself to me<br />Only in my stillness.&quot;<br />The 15 Indian miniatures illustrations are only tangentially related to the story, but are striking. For example there is a drawing of a sacred fire ritual prominent in the story, but there is also a drawing of Krishna, not at all in the story.	2004-03-10

Most fascinating to me are the stories of social insects, such as bees swarming around a hornet and producing enough heat to &quot;fry them\\" or ants and fungus cohabitating.  Also fascinating were the insects not normally thought of as social - but occurring in groups; such as 16,000 dung beetles on one elephant patty, and the communal tropical spider in groups of 165,000 in Mexico (sounds like a scene out of Harry Potter).  The spiders of course aren't insects, but thrown in for good measure.<br />There are also fascinating stories of extremes such as the Saharan silver ants that survive in 140 degree F heat.  Also interesting are tales of the entomologist, Dr. Raffensperger, the consulting insect detective, or the conservation biologist who is willing to doom the &quot;Uncompahgre fritillary butterfly&quot; to extinction.  These short essays, and occasional illustrations are delightful.  Lest you think insects inconsequential, they outweigh humans by a factor of 50.	2004-01-30

The inclusion of quotes from Thomas Kuhn and Nietzsche, (whether you agree with their viewpoints or not), highlight that Aristotle is still a relevant topic of discussion.  The importance of the rediscovery of Aristotle by Islamic Spain was welcome.

This book tries to place Plato both in the context of his time and looks at the heirs of Plato in the Neoplatonists and impacts on Christianity (I thought this was a little weak).  Strathern also reveals the paradoxes of Plato's life: decrying poetry but perhaps being the most poetic of the Greek philosophers and, leaning toward totalitarianism and lack of individual freedom, but being a very unique person.  Strathern gives Plato 15 pages to speak for himself with selection from the Republic (of course the parable of the cave), Letters, The Law and others.

Included here are many of the poet's famous in the late 1950's and early sixties, such as Robert Frost,  Archibald MacLeish, Elizabeth Bishop, Delmore Scwartz, Theodore Roethke .. an almost dizzying line up.  Perhaps Allen Ginzburg note &quot;Howl - Part II, took 4 buttons of dried Peyote in apartment on Nob Hill&quot;, may be indicative of the 1960's.  The subject of the poems range widely from David Wagoner's  exploring nature &quot;Piping sharp as a reed, the small bird stood its ground&quot; to Randall Jarrell &quot;Eight air force ... This is a war.... But since these play, before they die, Like puppies with their puppy&quot;<br />Perhaps more interesting than the chosen poems, is the obvious agony that some of the poet's express in having to choose. For example Oscar Williams  &quot;To ask for a poet's own favorite poem is a contradiction of terms, calling for reliance on one &quot;letter to the world&quot; of what should remain a large and total correspondence.  &quot;  or William Meredith &quot;A poet with any modesty at all has to shake off both his modesty and the sense of partial failure that hangs over even his favorite poem&quot;.  Many of the poets talk about dozens of revisions, but some also talk of the serendipity of sometimes almost complete delivery.	2004-01-30

Perhaps initially readers, as perhaps does the character, pastor Dan Poole, may look to their own &quot;Neo&quot; for answers, but I think the ending of the book, points out that it is more useful to look for questions than dogmatic answers.  Certainly some paragraphs were added to provoke (for example: &quot;I'd have to say that the world is better off for having these (Other) religions than having no religions at all, or just one, even if it were ours&quot;.)  Embracing the doubt (see Paul Tillich - The Courage to Be) is scary.  One challenge is how far to remove oneself from a mainstream, while still maintaining important fellowship.  I think the discussions on &quot;The Church&quot; versus &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, and individuality are challenging, and perhaps more accessible (if not as deep) as Kierkegaard.  I'll also want to read C.S. Lewis' the Discarded Image, for understanding of how Christianity went from the Middle Ages to more modern times.  Reading about pre-modern Christians, such as the Desert Fathers might also help understand the post-modern.	2004-01-06

There are no notes or index included here, but plenty of great stories!  There are stories from the oral tradition of the Jews and often reveal a different aspect of an old familiar story or more personality of a familiar character.  For example: Eve and the Apple, &quot;She made a compromise with her conscience.  First she ate only the outside skin of the fruit, and then seeing that death did not befall her, she ate the fruit itself&quot;.  I particularly enjoyed some of the earliest stories, and remarkable creatures such as the tahash, &quot;which has been created only that its skin might be used for the Tabernacle&quot;, or the remarkable &quot;reem&quot; of which there is just one male and female at opposite ends of the earth &quot;Had there been more, the world could hardly have maintained itself&quot;.  The stores of Moses and the Exodus reveal Moses as very human and a time when God was communicating with man and &quot;kissed&quot; Moses' soul.  I assume that the detailed notes include the origin of the stories, but there is at least one story (p552) that included a Moslem.

This fondness is expressed in each of eleven poets selected from the Dodge Poetry Festival of 1998.  The book starts with 90-year-old Stanley Kunitz reflection on Haley's Comet in 1910 to and continues to Robert Pinsky discussing his online poetry feature for Slate. There is music in many of these poems; most explicitly in Robert Pinsky's Ginza Gamba and references to Lester Young and Kurt Lamkin scatting with the kora, an African string instrument.  If you can find the 2-hour PBS special on video (our library had a copy), you can hear the music of the kora and the Paul Winter Consort accompanies Coleman Barks.<br />The joy of a book is the diversity ranging from Coleman Barks translation of Rumi &quot; I see my beauty in you&quot;, to the new Jewish tradition of the &quot;Chuppah&quot; of the Wedding, of Marge Piercy.  Perhaps Mark Doty's two poems about a dog &quot;Beau&quot; most show the depth of a poet - from a very touching poem about licking a dieing friend, to the rambunctious &quot;Golden Retrievals&quot;.	2003-12-23

The tone is often humorous, but ends with a serious topic.  About half the book is spent looking at the house edge on roulette, craps, and slot machines.  He presented a &quot;winning strategy (almost)&quot; for blackjack, however he does not include the calculation for the house edge there.<br />I thought the section on chance and chaos were excellent and I'd recommend to readers setting up the logistic difference equation of animal populations on a spreadsheet, to really demonstrate the effect of initial conditions.  Contrary however to this strong section on biology, was a weak paragraph on evolution.<br />The later discussion on game theory was well done, looking at the Minimax criteria and the pay-off models.  This chapter might have been enhanced by other strategies of decision, such as &quot;avoiding regret\\".  The final application of game theory to the Yugoslavian conflict was daring, and showed a different perspective about complex conflicts.

Starting with the initial Western Union Cablegram announcing the suicide of Bolitho Blane, most of the story unfolds as if from report of Detective Officer Kettering or from transcriptions of interviews between the detective and boat passengers.  Also included are photos of the passengers and crime scene, and letters written by the principles (which are somewhat difficult to read).  A used matchstick and hair sample are included.  The story moves along well, and a lot of the narrative is spent trying to figure out who was where between 7:30 and 8:30.  Perhaps what is not conveyed is the personality of the passengers and especially of the detective.  Perhaps if you are skilled you will be able to solve it yourself, but I know I was surprised when I broke the strip to reveal the killer.

The conflicting theories are presented as a compelling mystery.  At one point midpoint through the book we are left with the circular argument that there are more animal species because there are more plant species, and there are more plant species because there are more animal species.  Fortunately, a following chapter on evolution presents some of the advances  out of the quandary.<br />The book is beautifully illustrated, and some real striking figures are of the mammal diversity (arboreal/terrestrial, and diurnal versus nocturnal) of mammals in Borneo, or the example of convergence in new world and old world tropics.  Perhaps the chapter on management of the tropics did not delve deep into looking at the social issues at play (I found Hecht and Cockburn's &quot;The Fate of the Forest&quot; a good look at those dynamics in the Amazon).  The application of conservation biology studies on fragmentation and genetic diversity are important conservation issues though.  There are sparse mentions of the indigenous people, for example in the Amazon while there were 6-12 million there are now less that 200,000.	2003-11-24

Each chapter looks at a psychological processes making up creativity.  Starting with a proposition, Perkins then presents facts and arguments that result in a revised proposition that more accurately portrays how the mind works.  For example in chapter two the initial proposition is &quot;Mental leaps depend upon on extended unconscious thinking&quot;, then after arguing that the subconscious plays less of a role in creativity the revised proposition becomes &quot;Extended unconscious thinking does not occur. Deferring a troublesome problem and returning to it later occasionally helps for reasons that have nothing to do with extended unconscious thinking.&quot;  By delving into these processes, Perkins demystifies creativity into a skill that can be learned as a balance of imagination and analysis.<br />Along the way to a more final proposition are short mental exercises that provide the reader experience with the ideas.  For example, on &quot;searching for&quot; there is an exercise on perceptual hill climbing that involves trying to perceive drawings.  There are surprises and myth busting in many chapters, such as dispelling that the left-brain is scientific and right intuitive.  Some useful examples of creativity presented include Darwin's &quot;discovery&quot; of natural selection, and Albert Einstein on simplicity of evaluating an idea.  The example of &quot;Instant Zen&quot;, presented a paradoxical example of field-specific generalizations and use of heuristics: not only showing its power but its limits. Although not generally a \\"how to\\" book; the chapter on heuristics presents more definite methods such as SQ3R (Survey, question, read, recite, review) as a plan for reading.	2003-10-29

Existentialists may like to claim him as he speaks of the individual about despair, fear and trembling, and anxiety, but make no mistake his work is to be a Christian (&quot; Once and for all I must urgently request the kindly disposed reader continually to bear in mente [in mind] that the total thought in the entire work as an author is this&quot; becoming a Christian&quot;).  He is a self appointed critic of the established church and the inclusion of the lesser known &quot;The Lily of the Field and the Bird of the Air' shows the religious side.  Present are all of Kierkegaard's &quot;Knights&quot;: the Knight of Faith, the Knight of Infinite Resignation, and the Knight of Hidden Awareness. Humor and irony abound. Come leap in, and have a good read!	2003-10-03

The beautiful photographs by Barbara Garland add color to the book and complement the text; a good example is the picture of the male cardinal presenting a seed to the female.  Sometimes in my rush for rarities I may neglect my own local birds, and this book will help me be more aware of my backyard.  As a fan of both the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team and the Louisville Cardinals basketball team I appreciated the chapter on &quot;Cardinal as Icon\\".  The author can be forgiven for her occasional anthropomorphism.  One theory I have heard of the Cardinals early expansion into the Midwest was the following of grain in rails and boats along the Mississippi and is now expanding westward.	2003-10-03

There are poems of bogs where he digs in with his pen, such as the image of &quot;The Tollund Man&quot; found dead in the bog, or Strange Fruit with  &quot;Her eyeholes blank as pools in the old workings&quot;.  There are Irish scenes of the lough (lakes) and the corncrake.  The poems span 30 years, and the British-Irish fighting in the 1970's is reflected in some sad memories.  These poems have a universal appeal and in his included Nobel lecture he states, &quot;I have already begun a journey into the wideness of the world&quot;.  I would agree with one reviewer who notes a medieval tone and there is a certain solemnity: &quot;Read poems as prayers&quot;, he states in the longer poem Station Island.  You can hear him read some of these poems in the audiotape &quot;Stepping Stones.\\"	2003-10-03

Paulos writes directly, usually without formulas, and if a particular essay doesn't click for you, keep turning, there's a new one in a few pages.  Although the essays are mostly independent, there are some interesting connections.  In light of the California governors voting recall, the section on voting systems seems clairvoyant, but he warns against the &quot;Jean Dixon&quot; effect in an earlier essay.  The essays present mathematics as a dynamic field, and something as basic as variables, was just invented in the 16th century.  Even since this book first came out, Fermat's last theorem has been proved, and there is even a larger prime number.<br />For those working with computers, there is a reminder of some of the mathematical background such as Al-Khwarizmi in Baghdad inventing the &quot;Algorithm&quot;, the Turing Test, and sorting.<br />Paulos always touches on the human aspects of math, such as the fractal nature of human consciousness or mathematics in ethics.<br /> QED - a great read	2003-09-23

The poems may not have the same subject or form as those in &quot;Summer Knowledge&quot;, being more free and more sentimental (more like Whitman), but he was still producing good poems.  For example in the 1965 poem Spring:  &quot;The earth, just like a schoolgirl, memorizes Poems, so many poems...&quot;  Schwartz was still interested in the Kingdom of poetry, for example: &quot; Unless ye be as a little child ye cannot enter the kingdom of poetry&quot;.  The Studies of Narcissus provide an innovative twist on the familiar story, that looking into a stream provided a changing image on oneself.  Knowing about the years of drug and alcohol abuse, these lines from the 1958 poem seemed particularly poignant:<br />&quot;afraid of every little death,<br />... or sickened by the terror of new hope,<br />or certain, again, that every death of any hope<br />Concludes all hope and makes the body's death<br />More desirable than the recurrent torment of the years.&quot;	2003-09-12

There are some remarkable photos; my favorites include the Marine Iguana, the Galapagos shark, and the Stone Scorpionfish (which looks like something from Star Wars).  Mark Blum specializes in underwater stereo photography, and some of the underwater photos such as the seahare or spotted moray eel really pop out.  There are also the Galapagos favorites such as Sally Light-Foot Crabs and Sea Lions.  Only a few of the pictures did not work that well in 3-D, such as the brown pelican, or some of the habitat photos, but provided for well-rounded text.  Associated with each of the 44 pictures is a useful paragraph that introduces the species or habitat.  For example, I did not know that the sex of the Giant Tortoise offspring depended upon the temperature of the nest.  A fun book for any age!	2003-09-12

This book presents a good introduction to the major ideas of ethical thinking about the environment.  He presents ideas on how rights might be derived as a gradation from purely human interest, rights based on whether animals suffer, and nature with its own right.  Throughout the book questions of individual versus community rights are discussed.  Each chapter starts with a short essay that highlights some of the complexities; for example whether Mountain Goats should be introduced or eliminated in Olympic National Park.  Each chapter is concluded with discussion questions that also help the reader grapple with the issues.<br />He presents many of the major ideas and criticisms of animal rights, energy use, the land ethic, deep ecology, and ecofeminism.  Particularly in the areas of deep ecology he presents the diversity of views.  Perhaps he is weak in presenting third world views and the impact that &quot;Deep ecology&quot; might have on poor and agrarian populations.  He is lacking discussion of religious based environmental ethics (&quot;Theocentric ethics\\"). Christian Ecology seeks to develop a stewardship view, and Native American, and Eastern religions center on respect for nature.  I think this book works best when read with selections from the authors discussed; for example read some of Leopold's &quot;Sand County Almanac&quot;, then read the chapter on &quot;The Land Ethic.&quot;	2003-09-12

The topics included XML, CSS, XSLT and XPath, DOM, SAX, and XML Schemas.  All these abbreviations are explained in the book.  The core concepts are well introduced without being overwhelmed in syntax, and advice if often given on what is best to use (for example \\"Can I use DOM or SAX instead of XSLT?\\").<br />The use of an 8 character \\"CodeNote pointer\\" allows obtaining additional information from the codenotes web site while keeping the book a readable size and price.  For example the paper chapter on SAX included examples in Java, but the online \\"CodeNotes\\" allows obtaining the source in Visual Basic.  In the chapter on installation, I found both the instructions on the book and the online web site out of date, so they might want to update the web.

The examples were from both North America and Europe, and as a North American the problems of crossing the Sahara were new to me.

These laws of human behavior, though tongue-in-cheek, offer more than a grain of truth. Perhaps some of the laws could be updated, for example \\"Systems tend to expand to fill the known universe\\", could be rewritten as: \\"The Internet (or amazon.com?) tends to expand to fill the known universe.\\"  I'm afraid that the Internet is a classic example of \\"The real world is what is reported to the system\\", as we look to our search engines to find the truth.

Perhaps it is based on early Vedic texts, but it is based on his direct experience also.  1800 years later Hartranft, presents this new translation that somehow breathes new life into the 196 aphorisms.<br />His translation seeks to find a fluid way of expressing a line in English.  In his commentary he explains some of the Sanskrit terms.  He avoids going too deep into later Hatha Yoga, and avoids the highly philosophical discussion. Patanjali's aphorisms are about the &quot;practice&quot;; &quot;Yogic activity has three components; discipline, self-study, and orientation toward the ideal of pure awareness&quot;.	2003-08-07

Each of the esteemed authors presents a unique perspective and analysis on the time period they covered, such as \\"Herod's reforms\\", or the \\"impact of Christianity\\".  The chapters on the relationship of Jews with Muslims, and the slow march into the Modern World were most interesting.  The book concludes with a discussion of Arab-Israeli relationships that helps in understanding some of the current tensions.<br />There are some remarkable pictures, such as a coin from Jerusalem when under Persian Rule, an Ivory pomegranate from King Solomon temple, or pictures of the refuge ship the SS St. Louis waiting for news in Havana's Harbor.  A map at the start of each chapter helps place the history in a larger regional context.<br />I might have enjoyed a little more explanation of some of the ideas of the time, such as the Philosophies of Hillel, the laws of Moses Maimonides, the radical thoughts of Spinoza, or some of the mysticism of the Kabbalah.	2003-08-07

There were some rough lectures for my &quot;beginner mind&quot; but there are some real gems, particularly when imparting stories of the Buddha or monks.<br />Sokei-an was one of the first Zen Masters to come to American, and some of the most fascinating lectures are those contrasting Buddhism and Christianity, such as the Triune Body of Buddha and the Christian Trinity.

Additionally there are short paragraphs by such authors as Augustine, Solzhenitsyn, and Ellie Wiesel.  Finally short quotes provide gems for further meditation.  I found this book useful for myself as an individual, but would be great for Bible discussion groups.  Though familiar, these Genesis stories never fail to surprise.	2003-07-03

Starting with a brief history of the post card and publishers, she then presents some common symbolism.  She moves through the year, covering each of the holidays.  At New Year's are images of pigs pulling a coach.  On Valentines days is the &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;, with ill wishes from someone you may have wronged.  At Christmas are Louis Wain's cats, which can be rare (and the relative prices of the cards are indicated).  She includes holidays not commonly celebrated in the states today, such as Guy Fawkes Day, the Mexican Day of the Dead, and Krampus.  Because of her own collection, the images of Halloween are spectacular and a highlight of the book.  My only minor complaint would be that on some of the light backgrounds her annotations are hard to read.	2003-07-03

I agree with the premise of this book; that we should reconnect with insects.  However, Lauck seems to need connections that include telepathy with ants, Jungian synchronicity, spiders that warn people of danger, and an out-of-body experience as a butterfly.  She seems willing to accept these individual antidotal accounts, but does not accept, or seek a deeper understanding of ecological thinking.  The book works best at discussing insect mythology and she covers a wide variety of cultures. Kritsky and Cherry's \\"Insect Mythology\\" is also a useful source of these myths.  The stories promote enthusiastic awareness and compassion, and avoiding thinking of individual insects as adversaries.  She off-hand dismissed the &quot;male dominated Judea-Christian tradition&quot;, but I think a deeper reading of the Bible (e.g. Noah's Arc, and &quot;Consider the Ant), would help people of that tradition to connect also.<br />She rejects some preventative health advice, and I think it is irresponsible to advocate &quot;sharing your blood&quot; with mosquitoes in this day of West Nile virus.  I think it is possible to connect with insects by trying to understand them on their own terms, and as part of the ecosystem, rather than as a human centered signpost.  Sue Hubbells' \\"Broadsides from the other orders&quot;, promote a connection with insects without the sensationalism.  My own studies in dragonfly migration, promote my connection to insects, and I think readers would do well to study insects directly.  The scientific references are often vague, and &quot;Discover&quot; magazine seems to be her main scientific reference.	2003-06-25

Written in 1938, this predates his imprisonments and to quote an English officer \\"Bonhoeffer always seemed to me to spread an atmosphere of happiness and joy\\". If he could establish a Christian community in Gestapo prison, can't we try also? I have been guilty of defining a Christian Community in terms of human reality, but Bonhoeffer more clearly centers the community. I am sure there are times I should have paid heed to the section \\"The Ministry of Holding One's tongue\\". Bonhoeffer clearly shows the balance of community and being alone ... \\"Let him who cannot be alone beware of community. Let him who is not in community beware of being alone\\". The perspective of day-to-day work as \\"a test of meditation\\" shows the importance of renewing the blessing of fellowship at the end of the day.<br />Particularly for those with Protestant background the discussion on confession is challenging, and his phrase about \\"daring to be a sinner\\" is paradoxical. \\"In the presence of a psychiatrist I can only be a sick man; in the presence of a Christian brother I can dare to be a sinner\\".	2003-06-06

Perhaps, as is suggested in one footnote, Watson had strict instructions to conceal the identity of everyone ... and hence every train mentioned in the Canon is erroneous.<br />Klinger does a masterful job of using sources such as the 1883 Encyclopedia Britannica and the 1894 Baedeker's handbook of travel in Britain as well as recent scholarship.  For example, in a footnote in the Noble Bachelor describing that there is food enough for four,  &quot;Holmes must have deduced that Lord St. Simon would not remain to share the repast; a point which Watson completely missed&quot;. Klinger also provided his own insights.  The few appendices provide insight into such things as the identity of the snake in the speckled band or unrecorded cased recorded in the five orange pips.  Perhaps the only annoying thing in the book is the use of abbreviations of some of the references.  The Baring-Gold annotated Sherlock Homes is, still essential, and this is a welcome addition.	2003-05-27

Although the title implies \\"management\\", the number of specific management recommendations varies depending upon the author, taxonomic group or geographic area being discussed.  In all the chapters, is an overwhelming call for more research.<br />Tallahassee's own Dr. James and Charles McCulloch, provided a key paper, on the strength of inferences about causes.  Often it is easy to blame one source or another for declines, but this paper helps understand the need for \\"true experiment\\".<br /><br />An interesting series is four chapters on temporal perspectives on population limitation, including a discussion of summer versus winter limitation, habitat use in the neoptropics, and habitat requirements during migration.  The chapter on insect outbreaks and other perturbations (such as climate) by Rotenberry et al  was important perspective, particular here in Florida, where a hurricane can change the vegetative characteristics of an area overnight.<br />The middle six chapters discuss forest management, and other human effects such as agricultural practices (this chapter was particularly eye opening: with 52% of the land area in the 48 contiguous states).<br />The final section on landscape scale perspectives, provided problems of management at different scales, from a local clear-cut to continental scale.  This perhaps might have been frustrating to the land manager seeking to understand how to manage his 1000 acres, or what to do about the cowbirds that are impacting wood thrush.<br />There are other threats such as West Nile Virus, exotic species, and perhaps global warming that may become important in the future.

The book does a good job of introducing human ancestors, starting with Lucy - the female Australophitcus afarensis, that launched Dr. Johanson's career and fame.  Perhaps what the book does best, is introduce the study of paleoanthropology and archeology by presenting both sides of topics. For example: did modern humans all came out of Africa or evolve in separate places throughout Europe and China?; when and why did hominids first walk on two legs (scavenger or hunter)?; are Neanderthal's our ancestors?  He presents how studying anatomy helps understand the physical changes needed to walk on two feet and to give birth to a large brained baby.  He also introduces the recent idea of \\"experimental archeology\\" that conducts trials on current landscapes or prey to see how early hominids may have lived.  At the time of the book were the beginnings of studies with mitochondrial DNA.  His conclusion about the birth of art, may be tentative, but should provoke interesting thoughts.

The pictures are spectacular, whether it is wandering albatross courtship, an upside-down emperor bird-of-paradise, or a common bee-eater offering his mate a dragonfly.  A minor annoyance is that the location of the species pictured is not usually listed.

There are haunting poems like &quot;Man who beat up homosexuals reported to have AIDS virus&quot;. There are also touching personal elegies.. &quot;Was love, Jim, ever more than a hand poked through the shower curtain-- a blurred touch easily rinsed away, laughed off?&quot;  and &quot;Well past sixty, I know little more about wisdom than we did at thirty, but lots more about folly...&quot;.<br />There are also marvelously urbane and literate references, to artists like Monet and Matisse, and titles that begin with lines from Harry James and Isadora Duncan.  The references extend to the Bible ... &quot;The Bible says to forgive out enemies, not our friends.\\"  Many of these poems are monologues that I felt gave a snapshot of a different life, like reading the caption on an old postcard, of someone I didn't know.  Although these poems may seem somber, I had the chance to hear him read in person, which helped me appreciate some of the subtle humor here.	2003-03-17

As the cover jacket says, this is \\"intended to teach both history and morality of a people\\", like an Old Testament story.  The strength of the young boy who constructs a toy insect out of corn, is both touching and has lessons for us now in how we treat others and our resources.  The drawings by Janet Grado, add nicely to the story, particularly the portraits of the corn maidens and the old woman.  Although suitable for children, fans of Toni Hillerman will also enjoy this.	2003-03-17

I recently had the privilege of hearing him read, and as he said he likes the approach of \\"considering the reader .. Imagine that\\". There are some \\"shameless appeals to dog lovers\\" (to quote Collins), such as the poem about his dog (Dharma),...\\" if only I were not her god.\\". Often there is the unexpected phrase or a darkening, and something unusual happens in the reader, some glance in the mirror that is a surprise. For example from \\"On turning ten\\", \\"It seems only yesterday I used to believe there was nothing under my skin but light.\\".<br />His poems are natural and relaxed, with a sense of humor about their structure, such as the poem \\"Sonnets\\", whose lines count down the fourteen lines of the sonnet. Perhaps his poem \\"Forgetfulness\\", reminds me of Elizabeth Bishop's \\"One Art\\". Some of the poems create a real atmosphere, like \\"I am listening to John Hartman whose dark voice can curl around the concepts of love, beauty, and foolishness like no one else's can. \\"	2003-03-17

As a complete novice, I learned enough to read CGI scripts.  It was helpful to work on the well-done examples and then to look at the answers. I would have preferred a \\"log cracking\\" example rather than &quot;secret words\\".  Although I got the syntax of the hashes, I missed their glory in solving problems. The regular expression examples were good, but I could have used a full-blown example here also.  This book sent me searching for CGI/web packages, such as the database package DBI (which may have been more useful than the DBM), the graphics package (GD), and more on writing HTML code from Perl scripts.	2003-03-17

This text provides a readable introduction to Darwin's five major theories of evolution  (Don't know what they are? ... better read the book!) and a clear definition of the biological species concept.  He emphasis on evolution occurring on populations and the elimination of the unfit individual is important (in contrast to Richard Dawkins view of the gene as the target of selection).  The book is well organized, with short sections that lead you along.  The illustrations help explain some of the concepts, and a minor beef is that some of those copied from other books have been reduced too much (maybe the eye needs a little more evolution after all!).<br />The concluding part of the book, on human evolution, will be the most controversial and intriguing.  Mayr presents his view of the lineage and makes no pretense that this view is fact ... but is merely a point of discussion.  The short section on evolution of human ethics perhaps may be a little weak,  considering the body of work on evolutionary psychology.  The final chapter on &quot;The future of evolutionary&quot; thought, may intrigue developing biologists, and brings home the practicality of evolutionary studies to pesticides and pests, and viruses and man.	2003-03-17

For some of these, Bellow had a chance to review and edit the completed transcript, and the words are well crafted.  There is some biographic info included (e.g., Dr. Goldenweiser assured him he wasn't cut out for science.  His papers had \\"to much style\\"), but generally Bellow avoids the trapping of \\"cultural furniture\\", and it's gossip-like quality.  The best of these conversations focus on ideas and novels.  Many of the books contain autobiographical characteristics that comes out in the writing,  as Bellow says, \\"My faults of character emerge in my writing\\".  But when talking about Sammler, he warns that a character has his own logic. \\"I do not choose such a person for the purpose of expressing my own religious views\\".  The two most biographical pieces are contained in \\"It all adds up\\", his book of non-fiction.  The index is nicely done, and allows for easily finding material about a particular novel.<br />Bellow remains optimistic about the role of art in society \\"Maybe civilization is dying, but it still exists, and meanwhile we have our choice: we can either rain more blows on it, or try to redeem it\\".  Although \\"What you call optimism may be nothing more that an mismanaged, misunderstood, vitality\\".  There are interesting antidotes about Chicago, his beloved city, for example, when Mayor Daley presented Bellow a check, a reporter asked if he had read Herzog, Daley responded \\"I've looking into it\\".  There is a fun piece with Gloria Steinman who spends a day in Chicago with him.  During one interview he talks of writing a non-fiction book on Chicago, but that evolved into the \\"Dean's December.  One of my favorite quotes is \\"I'm happy when the revisions are big.  I'm not speaking of stylistic revisions, but revisions in my own understanding. ...  .Exceptional things must be attempted if the game is to be worth the candle\\".

The book, also shows how Darwin's thinking evolved, how the idea itself evolved from outside influences (particularly plate tectonics and cosmology), and how it influenced non-biological thinking (such at utilitarianism, capitalism, Marxism) sometimes in scary ways such as eugenics.<br />Throughout the book, it seems like philosophers (at least in the West) desired a purpose and direction of evolution, if not a Director.  Lamarckianism (inheritance of acquired characteristics) also seemed to have continual appeal and in the later editions of the Origin of Species, Darwin himself was leaning more that way.  The continual difficulty of direct evidence and incomplete fossil record, leads to ongoing speculations.<br />Although generally dry/scholarly there are a few fun side-diversions, such as Kammerer's midwife toad.  Bowler also highlights other key figures such as paleontologist Georges Cuvier and \\"Darwin's bulldog\\" Thomas Huxley.  I would have like more history of how the general public accepted the idea, perhaps by tracing the teaching in schools or textbooks.  Readers of this might also enjoy Dawkins &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;.	2003-01-29

Colonel Aureliano Buendias endless melting and creating his gold fishes also highlights this cycle and the interplay of memory and forgetting.<br /> Full of sensuous smells as Melquiades' laboratory, tastes as Rebecca's mud, and delightful colors as Mauricio's yellow butterflies the book can be intoxicating.

Starting with a contrast of Melville's description of Galapagos as a hell and Darwin's own explorations, Larson traces the history of the idea of evolution, both scientifically and on popular thought.  By focusing on the Galapagos, Larson provides a readable account of both how studies in the Galapagos shaped evolutionary thought (From Darwin to Lack to the Grants) but also how the social climate of the day, influenced the explorers, for example how the exuberance of Teddy Roosevelt, affected explorers of the day, or how Harvard zoologist Louis Agassiz influenced the California collecting spree.<br />Larson also reflects on the effects of civilization on the Galapagos, from turtle collecting, to the World War II airstrip at Baltra, to current tensions between protection, locals, and harvest.  Science has not always been on the side of protection, for example, &quot;Save them for science&quot; became the cry (at the turn of the last century), even if it meant capturing or killing the last on in the wild.  The drawings and photographs complement the text, and include such treats as a photo of Louis Agassiz, sketches from Darwin, and a photo of 250 tortoise specimens in the California Academy of Sciences.  I would also recommend Weiner's &quot;The Beak of the Finch&quot;, and Darwin's &quot;The Voyage of the Beagle&quot; has a chapter on the Galapagos.  Incidentally, the title of the book is probably derived from Darwin's own description of the Galapagos' volcanic hills and craters &quot;From their regular form, they gave the country a workshop appearance&quot;.	2003-01-29

This book introduces the fundamentals of database systems by emphasizing the relational data model, and that a database is really \\"a collection of true .. propositions\\".  Although his use of Tutorial-D (rather than SQL) may seem odd, Date emphasizes thinking about data rather than an implementation.  This book provides great fundamental thinking about relational variables (relvars), domains, relational algebra, and data normalization.<br />The further topic of missing information contrasts to Codd's four-valued logic, and even if your particular database system supports different Nulls the chapter helps when thinking about your own data.  Whether or not you agree with his thinking about object-oriented databases, his \\"Two great blunders\\" are a challenge to any software vendor.  His chapter on decision support does not provide much of an introduction to such broad topics as warehousing, OLAP, and data mining, but there are other sources.  This is not an easy read, but working through it will pay off when coupled with product training.	2002-12-18

In this 1990 book, Codd introduces \\"Version 2\\", where he collects a number of his ideas and extends his model.  This book is not about specific database package or about SQL (Except for a chapter entitled &quot;Serious Flaws in SQL&quot;), but rather about the concepts behind relational databases.  Codd sets the standard and goals that, as yet, no vendor completely delivers.  His emphasize on corrective steps for duplicate rows, should not be ignored by vendors.<br />This is not an easy book to read, with some of his own notation  (For example \\"And clearly S \ U / T = T \ U / S\\"), but he presents an understanding of the basis of the relational model.  The chapter on \\"Missing information\\" and his 4 valued logic, with Missing-but-applicable and Inapplicable presents a richer understanding than the usual \\"Null\\" concept.  His chapter on \\"View updatability\\" is helpful for those who has gotten the message \\"Recordset is not updateable\\".  Fabian Pascal and C.J. Date have reviewed the relational model in articles available online as well as in a Date's recent book \\"The Database Relational Model: A Retrospective Review and Analysis.&quot;  Codd challenges the alternatives to the relational model to present a clearly worked out model.  With XML going strong, it will be important to develop mathematical underpinnings.	2002-11-11

This book would be valuable to a business contracting to set up a database. By using down-to-earth (\\"mortal\\") terms, Hernandez makes clear the value of normalization, and his &quot;ideal table&quot; and &quot;ideal field&quot; guidelines are practical presentations of the often more theoretically presented normalization.  By describing how to document a table and field descriptions, Hernandez provides documentation guidelines that are often overlooked in introductory works.  It might be valuable to store the answers to his &quot;Field specification worksheet\\" into a \\"metadata\\" database.<br />There were a few parts of the book that I thought could have been amplified. The use of &quot;subset&quot; tables was introduced, but lacked discussion on how to build joins between main and subset tables.  Database business rules were introduced, but &quot;application-oriented&quot; business rules were not, and they might influence the database structure.  I applaud his inclusion of documenting &quot;views&quot;, but I would have appreciated a discussion of testing the results of a view.  Finally, his &quot;Final goodbye&quot; to the company seems too optimistic ... often there are changes after the initial design.  Still, all in all, a useful book!	2002-10-30

Boll writes about the importance of books and intelligence in his childhood.  These are not just the books in class (\\"Yes, school, I know -- I'll get back to that.\\"), but more importantly outside reading: Dostoevsky, Dickens, Haecker.  His family made every effort to provide his reading.  Present in this account is his sense of humor (despite the foreboding of Hitler and the Hitler Youth), as well as the fighting of the meaningless bureaucracy; for example bribing to keep his brother from participating in any of the Youth activities.  This includes the Boll we see later, watching \\"Hands in pockets, eyes open, street hawkers, peddlers, markets, churches, museums ...\\".  From classroom efforts to condense Mein Kampf, Boll learned brevity; perhaps the only positive thing about the Nazi's during this oppressive time.  Boll stands as an individual against the totalitarian climate.  I think we are all pleased that Boll pursued a career of \\"Something to do with books\\".	2002-10-29

As many reviewers pointed out, there were some errors at key points, which muddied things up for someone new to databases.  There were a few places where pages were added with little value; I really didn't need to see 6 pages of the \\"Mighy-Mite motors product catalog\\", the 20  pages of SQL CREATE TABLE statements, or even the chapter on CASE tools.<br />On the positive side, I appreciated the discussion of normalization, as well as \\"Codd's Rules\\".  For those who have used keys packed with information, the section on \\"Avoiding meaningful primary keys\\" was useful.  I appreciated the cursory mention of data flow diagrams; as I often think that database designers and database application developers would benefit from using these techniques to communicate the intersection of tables and process.  I would have appreciated including this in the case studies.  The case studies were thought provoking, and brought home some of the problems about many-to-many relationships.	2002-10-16

From here the mystery starts, and continues from a literary circle, to a strip tease artist.  The conclusion was a shocker for me, although looking back, the clues and the character development fit!

Though salt marshes don't have high species diversity, the Teal's cover the range from Spartina  and Juncus  plants (and sawgrass in Florida), to the economically important Blue Crabs,  to annoying insects like greenheads and deerfly.  From the salt marsh detritus, is the nutrient soup that becomes the basis for the shrimp and mullet we love to eat.<br />The Teals also offer conservation ideas.  When the book was written (1969), DDT was not yet banned.  The chapter on mosquito control is enlightening ... and with the occurrence of West Nile Virus, there will be more pressure on mosquito control, so one hopes it is balanced.  The history of marsh destruction in Boston is illustrative.  The good news is that in the 1950's the rate of coastal wetland loss was about 46,000 acres/year, but today it is around 20-25,000 per year.  Unfortunately pressures of coastal development continue.  This book helps me feel lucky to live near Florida \\"Big Bend\\" with large stretches of Gulf salt marsh from the Ochlockonee River south to St. Petersburg.	2002-10-01

The Minneapolis days are also explored, as well as the importance of group comradeship in the Kansas City Seven. Interviews with sidemen dispel the myth of a decline after WW II, and I would have appreciated more quotes from these interviews.<br />Some common themes throughout the book are the impact of race in the south and in touring and booking policies. Pres's integrity, independence, and perhaps stoicism is highlighted. The importance of Lester to swing, bebop, cool, and the \\"beat-nicks\\" is obvious in the well-written last \\"Legacy\\" chapter. Throughout the book one gets the historical feel of the history of Jazz from Minstrel to King Oliver to Basie to Jazz at the Philharmonic.<br />There are weaknesses in the book. Young left few written letters and had few interviews, but there are many cases where Daniels infers inner thoughts from external surroundings.... for example \\"Oliver was a father figure to Young\\". Daniels' style is academic, and the dryness doesn't always work well for a true individual like Pres. The narrative would have benefited from more antidotes and quotes from Lester, particularly with respect to his relation with Billy Holiday. More emphasis on Lester's musical style and important recordings would have been expected, and a complete discography with sidemen, would have been more beneficial than the over 100 pages of notes.	2002-09-11

Restak provides many pictorial examples of experiments as well as P.E.T. scans and EEG output to particularly show neurological locations of brain functions.<br />Perhaps the most evocative for me were the chapters on thinking and language.  Is language uniquely human?  Does language depend upon mind or mind depend upon language?  He also brings up the mind as &quot;computer&quot; model which probably was more popular in 1988 when the book was written.  This is a well-written book, with a fairly broad perspective from Descartes to the modern.<br />The chapters on depression and violence particularly bring up the questions of mind-body dichotomies.  Restak also discusses ethical problems, such as whether a person is responsible for a crime that may be a fault of the person's physiology.	2002-09-10

The authors are almost apologetic in discussing economic values, emphasizing that birds are also important ethically and culturally.  Fern Filion goes as far as listing Abraham Maslow's 5 level hierarchy of human needs.  The articles are diverse, from the marketing of a 100,000 bird swallow roost in Canada (estimated to have a social value of 1/2 million dollars), to the use of seabird eggs and young in Tasmania and Jamaica.  Hussein Isack presented a fascinating paper on the use of birds by the pastoral Boran nomads in Northern Kenya, which included birds as source of information.  Honeyguides may guide them to bee hives, and other species indicate coming rain or danger.  Although the Boran, currently avoid birds as food, the tendency to a more sedentary life may change this.<br />The second part of the book is base on an ICBP workshop of birds as bio-indicators of environmental conditions.  These papers emphasize that birds can be bioindicators since they may be higher in the food change and easier to monitor.  This seems particularly true of colonial waterbirds and seabirds, where diet or eggshell thickness may detect changes in prey fish populations or presence of toxins in the environment.  There is a series of papers also on waterfowls as indicator of pesticides and acidification.  I thought Welsh's use of woodpecker numbers and diversity as indication of forest stand condition was intriguing.  In Florida, birds are used as sentinels for detecting West Nile Virus.	2002-07-26

The progression continues to Godel and Turing, and from Turing to the modern computer.<br />Combining clear discussions of mathematical concepts with short biographical sketches, the intensity of some of these logical debates becomes clear.  For the 20th century figures, Davis offers first hand accounts, such as seeing Godel and Einstein walking together at Princeton (and this picture is included in the book), or his own 1954 computer program of a mathematical proof.<br />On the question of who invented the computer, Dr. Davis sides toward Turing and the influence of Turing on von Nuemann (contrast with Herman Goldstine: the Computer from Pascal to von Neumann).  Davis points out that the difference in architecture between Turing and von Nuemann is still evident today in the difference between RISC and full instruction set computers.  In the final chapter, Davis debates John Searle's understanding of the mind and consciousness.  I hope Davis writes a book about the logical connections after Turing.  These include Maurice's Karnaugh's method of minimizing boolean expressions, Jay Forester's memory and Industrial Dynamics, and perhaps Ted Codd and C.J. Dates database thinking.	2002-07-26

This is counter to those who propose following your \\"gut\\", or \\"do what feels good\\".  In the second part of the book, he offers a procedural ethics based on obligation, moral ideas, and consequences.<br />The real meat of the book are \\"inquiries\\"; examples of ethical problems for the reader to work.  They also promote a vague uneasiness of how difficult some of these short scenarios are.  The uneasiness is useful and caused me to think deeper about the dilemmas.  Students who are used to memorization, or looking for a \\"correct answer\\" may be frustrated.  This book is not about the history of ethics (and that chapter is perhaps too sparse), or ethical theory, but about the process of thinking.  My own desire for more worked samples, may indicate my uneasiness and search for a crutch of a supplied answer.  I would urge also each professional reader, to look at his own professional organization's code of ethics, in light of possible scenarios that may be encountered.	2002-06-25

For many of Florida's \\"fragile species\\", Don presents background natural history research, but most importantly highlights survey and land management methods.  For proactive management, this may include the use of fire to manipulate habitat succession, for example to help the gopher tortoise. Wood also sees the opportunity of species coexisting with other land uses, for example caracara and agriculture, or set back distances from eagle nests.  He offers some urban strategies such as not feeding sandhill crane, or accommodating burrowing owls.  Wood recognized some common problems among the species, such as habitat fragmentation, the need for urban strategies, and the confusion of resident versus winter populations when doing population surveys.<br />Although the pictures are useful, their use is sometimes uneven.  For example, there are three examples of a gopher tortoise burrow, but no picture of salt marsh sparrow habitat.  The maps were not always included, e.g., there was no map of the Florida Grasshopper sparrow distribution.  I would have also liked some discussion of coastal shorebird and tern species, which would also benefit from human awareness.	2002-06-20

For the mystery fan, there is a murder spanning millennium.  For the technologist, there are implications of accelerating technologies, of maintaining personal databases and records through millennium. Vinge's computer science teaching shines through without stifling his imagination.  Embedded systems with Intelligence Amplification (as opposed to AI) are explored, as well as wearable (err ..brain-networked) computers.  For the historian, there are those groping with the singular change and loss of humanity, and the manner of people dealing with being marooned for millennium (see Albert Camus - the Myth of Sisyphus).<br />For all this is a great story.  There are a lot of fun tidbits thrown in, like; \\"dragon\\" birds, who are evolving to set fires to get more to eat, people witnessing plate technonics, and interglobal network hacking (recall this was written before the internet!).	2002-06-20

Instead of the traditional life cycle, or \\"waterfall\\" approach to development, the Zachman framework presents architecture for organizing the perspective of the planner, owner, builder, designer and programming subcontractor.  Traditionally we may be very good at thinking about data and function, but Zachman adds the dimensions of network, organization, schedule and motivation. Laying out these perspectives in a matrix allows the different roles to communicate better.<br />In the framework matrix, for some combination of perspectives there are tools available, but for many there are not, so the methodology is uneven.  The framework presents an organization of metadata associated with organizing the artifacts or a project, particularly emphasizing the important of metadata about people, location, and motivation.<br />If your are looking for a warehouse design/blue print book, addressing data staging or star schemas then this book is not the best for you, but if you are looking for a book that offers a means of communicating between the data roles and stresses the need for guiding principles this book would be useful.	2002-06-06

In our day-to-day research, we often forget how paradigms influence and steer us into solving particular problems. This book makes these paradigms more obvious and looks at the &quot;development&quot; of science.  Specifically, Kuhn points out textbook writers as establishing a basic paradigm, and I would also add journal editors, who may avoid publishing the anomaly or negative results.  The anomalies are the irritants that cause science to generate the next pearl.  The end is not necessarily truth, but something useful in accounting for the anomalous.  Kuhn's postscript is interesting, since after five years of reviews, he had a chance to reflect on his previous work, and perhaps shift his own viewpoints with respect to scientific community.  He also admits the imprecision in his use of the word paradigm.  I would have been interested in his reflection on what the Internet is doing in terms of defining the community.	2002-06-06

This refutes the modern and western belief that the Christian &quot;Abundant Life&quot; means riches and lack of trouble.  There are many allusions to Revelations, brought out by the relatively minor character Lebedev.  There are apocryphal themes of making money, and the nihilism of the younger generation.  This book has the potential to personally impact you depending on how you identify with the characters.  The Prince, Prince S, and the various generals present different models of the &quot;good life&quot;.  To respond to an earlier reviewer, the cover painting by Hans Holbein is featured predominately in the book.  This book may be work for the reader, (as it was for Dostoyevsky to write) and I referred to list of character often, but the work is rewarding!	2002-06-06

As prevalent as insects are, it makes sense that there are myths on the origin of insects, and myths where insects are symbolic.  This short, well-illustrated book introduces interesting topics such as &quot;archaeoastronomy&quot; or  &quot;parallel mythology&quot;, where separated cultures having similar myths.  Examples include the metamorphism of butterflies and negative connotations of the flies (with the Navaho  &quot;Big Fly&quot; being a striking exception).<br />The entomological etymology (word origin) was enriching, and I most enjoyed the Greek origin (psyche) of butterfly and soul.  The chapter on arthropod references in the Bible, was helpful, and if nothing else highlights the prevalence of locust in the Middle East.  &quot;Go to the ant, you sluggard, watch her ways and get wisdom...&quot; has long been a favorite of mine.<br />With my own interest in Odonata, I appreciated images of the Haidu tattoo of the mythical dragonfly and Navaho sand painting. I would also refer to the Oglala Sioux dragonfly symbolism in the Sacred Hoop (see Ed McGaa - Mother Earth Spirituality).  This book also initiates thoughts on how the symbolism is still with us today, such as the Death's head moth in the &quot;Silence of the Lamb\\".	2002-05-09

Larson presents a grand introduction to forested freshwater wetlands in Florida, where water and trees dominate.  He presents a skillful blend of scientific background (including technical references) and personal experiences, particularly in Highland Hammocks State Park and Fakahatchee Strand.  He starts with a description and formation of the major areas including depression marshes in Okefenokee and Pinhook swamp basin swamps, and the nearby (to me) Shrub bogs in the prosaically named &quot;Tate's Hell&quot; and flooded river areas as along the Apalachicola, and Strands in South Florida.<br />The majority of the book goes through different plant and animal classes, and the book shines by its broad coverage.  There is sure to be an introduction to something new to each reader.  For example, I did not know that the weight of fungi per acre is about equal to a small car or that up to 50 species of river fish may feed in an adjacent flooded swamp.  For bird watchers, the tales of the Ivory Bill are most exciting, in light of current searches.  Larson closes this section with tales of the enigmatic black bear and Florida panther.<br />He closes the book with the call for education and advocacy for the wetland, and I would add basic care of oil after an oil change and safe storage of pesticides and chemicals.<br /> May you never be depressed in a depression marsh.	2002-05-09

Nothing ever happens but there is immediate publicity everywhere&quot;.  And those in government may appreciate &quot;In the end a whole age becomes a committee&quot;.  Perhaps the Internet is both a great leveler that Kierkegaard warned of, but also a perpetrator of the anonymous.  I think Kierkegaard might laugh at some of the pseudonyms floating around the net, far less creative than his many including Johannes Climacus.  Perhaps this anonymous net means no risk, but we need to &quot;Come on, leap cheerfully, even if it means a light-hearted leap, so long as it is decisive&quot;.<br />This book provides a good, short intro to Kierkegaard, and the humor keeps this moving without masking the personal challenges.	2002-05-09

As search engines get better the current \\"invisible webs\\" becomes more visible, and are probably replaced with a new class of invisible webs.  My own recent search was able to find many of the \\"invisible sites\\" in this book, so perhaps this book is best at giving you ideas of how to search better, for example if your looking for books search for \\"Library of Congress\\".

Although some of the principles of data management in this book should be review for those in the field, this book brings together this advise in one place.  Most useful to me were the sections on data archiving and metadata, which go hand in hand.  Throughout the book are references to data standards, and examples (such as online web sites) of implementing the principles.  I would have appreciated more mention of XML, which has the potential to promote data exchange.  I would have enjoyed more discussion of warehousing and mining, but you have to have the basic data management first!  I would whole heartedly agree with the basic premise of the book of the need for treating data as a resource and the need for stewardship to increase understanding, data value, and understand long term problems.	2002-04-30

With perhaps 1/4 of mainframe machine cycles spent sorting, this is an important topic. The first part introduces those topics we forgot as computer science majors; \\"The Big Oh notation\\"; data structures, and heuristic methods.  I got a lot from the section on dynamic programming, as well as the simulated annealing heuristic.  He perhaps too quickly dispenses genetic algorithms. The discussion on \\"the theory of NP-Completeness\\" left me behind, but I would return to that section as a reference. The second part of the book is an impressive catalog emphasizing non-numeric algorithms.  The accompanying CD adds great value to the book, with the complete book, a web site of algorithms, and audio class lecture.	2002-04-30

The sections on error handling and Active Server Pages will be useful to me.  A value of reading this book is to be introduced to topics you didn't previously know existed.  For example, learning about programming Outlook forms and Windows Script Host were useful though I have no immediate need for them.<br /><br />The real meat is the 260 pages of the reference.  Before jumping into that section, I would recommend reading Appendix A for a categorical listing of the elements. For example, if you are interested in doing string manipulation refer to the section on \\"String Manipulation\\" then look up the specific function alphabetically in the reference.  I would also recommend browsing through the complete reference - you are sure to find some new useful function such as the dictionary, filtering, regular expression matches and complete set of string functions.  In a few cases, I wish the examples were available on CD or from the web, but none are that long that re-typing is a major problem.	2002-04-30

More reflects on the Middle Ages, but was not yet ready for the Lutheran reformation.  More offers both humor (for example, using gold as chamber pots), and political thinking on capitalism. I however think his Utopia is a reflection of the monastic system (without severe asceticism) rather than communism.  I'm sure it is no accident that geographic the island of Utopia is similar to England.  It is ironic that More did not heed Raphael's advice about servitude to the king.  The inclusion of the humanist letters adds further to the humor.<br />This fine edition includes important predecessor such as Plato's republic and the Acts of the Apostles.  Description from Amerigo Vespucci's first voyage, calls to mind Rousseau's &quot;Noble Savage&quot;.  With the inclusion of selections from Ovid to Brave New World this book includes almost two millennium of utopian thinking.	2002-03-13

Wells first looks at Greek, Latin, or Egyptian sources for the names.  For example, I did not know that Egyptian mummified Ibis, the source of the ibis name.  She also calls up stories of early biologists as Linnaeus, Mark Catsby, and Audubon to look at some of the early naming. She relays Audubon's account of wood storks scratching his legs.  She also includes both obvious literary references such as Coleridge's albatross in the Rime of the Ancient Mariner and more obscure ones as Hamlet not being able to tell a \\"hawk from a handsaw\\" (heron).<br />In a few cases her ornithological information is not precise, for example in discussing \\"American\\" prairie chicken she says they \\"exist further south\\" (than the Northeast),  but further west would be a more accurate description.  The illustrations are sometimes not completely accurate, as the depiction of the thick upturned bill of the avocet.<br />For anyone who has wondered at such names as \\"goatsucker\\" this is a good readable, source.	2002-03-13

As a clergy, Swift wants to skewer the Enlightenment deism project of a rational religion.<br />Some of the other essays are more humorous, such as \\"A meditation upon a broomstick\\", and who can imagine the proposal of admiring gloves for ladies (made of baby's skin), being published today! The tale of the spider and the bee in the battle of the books, reminded me of Francis Bacon's earlier story of the spider, the ant, and the bee in the Novum Organum.

Depending upon your background, or desire to grapple with the details, some of the papers are quite technical; such as the math behind Britton et al. discussion of  deterministic metapopulation models, or chemistry behind proline use in Goldsworthy and Joyce.<br />The papers cover a variety of taxonomic classes. I was intrigued by Hardie et al description of  odour plumes \\"as cooked spaghetti pouring out of a chimney\\" .. when describing, for example, fruit fly orienting to an odor source.  Dingle's description of wing polymorphism of the soapberry bug was a fascinating exploration of selection of phenotypes.  Franks description of self organization of army ant swarm raids was a pure joy.<br />The technology ranged from Srygley and Oliveira tracking butterflies by boat in Panama, to Riley and Osborne's use of harmonic radar to track foraging bumblebees.  Also impressive was Drake et al description of network of data gathering light traps, insect monitoring radar, and GIS habitat assessment, to track locust movement in Australia.

On the web search for \\"Dartmouth Dante Project\\" and you will find many. The reading is helped by added commentary, for example understanding the role of Beatrice or Francesca as heroine. The Dorothy Sayers translation offers more background information. The audaciousness of the poet to enter this realm of Biblical themes is remarkable, as his ability to garner sympathy for some of the sinners, such as Ugolino. Its fun to think where Dante would have placed some of today's public figures. Kilmer's translation is clear and straightforward, fairly modern sounding. For example contrast Kilmers(from Cantos XXiv):<br />Quicker than I cross t, dot i,<br />he kindled, burned, and falling down,<br />was completely changed to ashes<br /> versus Sayers:<br />Never did writer with a single dash<br />Of the pen write \\"o\\" or \\"i\\" so swift as he<br />Took fire, and burned, and crumbled way to ash.<br />After I read the poem, I studied the dark illustrations by Benjamin Martinez and they present another view of the journey.	2002-01-31

He breaks the history up into Biblical foundations (Old and New Testament), ancient Christianity, Medieval times, reformation, early modern Christianity, and modern Christianity.  Within each era the division of the writings into Events, Institution, Teaching, Ethics, and Relations may be a bit artificial (for example is the beginning of Monasticism more about events, institution, or teaching?), but does help organize the readings.  Some of the dates on the sources are not clearly given, but generally this is not a problem as the general era is clear.<br />Van Voorst should be congratulated for including womens' perspective throughout the history, and at least some writings from the Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which often seems neglected in this country.  He often does a great job of pairing primary sources, for example pairing Anselm's scholastic argument on proving the existence of God with Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologiae.  Everyone will probably find missing some of their sources (like Dante), but there is a chance of discovering new authors shaping Christianity (like Hildegard of Bingen).  Whoever reads these texts will find some new understanding of how Christianity has grappled with some of the same historic issues of faith and works, but has also dealings with new topics such as bioengineering.	2002-01-31

I think his approach to planning is a good one, and I am fighting to find the necessary business sponsor and a clear business motivation.  Their approach to interviewing key players is a good way to collect requirements.<br />The importance of conformed dimensions and building a data warehouse bus architecture matrix is a great exercise.  Some of the controversy with respect to his advocacy of denormalizing has to do with how \\"pure\\" your warehouse is.  For example if I am merely providing analysis of production data or querying vertically across data marts, I would retain the data in normalized E/R, but present a more dimensional view to end users.  I appreciated the discussion on back room versus front room metadata and using active metadata to drive operations.  I was disappointed with the lack of discussion of warehouse testing with only a few pages on data quality and cleansing during data staging, and just one paragraph on balancing between the warehouse and production data.  This book is very useful, and the accompanying CD will save time creating your own project documents.	2002-01-15

What I fear however is that his slide towards pantheism denies some of the rich spiritual gifts of Christ and the Holy Spirit. For example it is Eckhart who says \\"God begets his Son in you whether you like it or not.\\" (See for example the book \\"Meister Eckhart from Whom God Hid Nothing : Sermons, Writings, and Sayings\\", or Schurmann's analysis of Eckhart in \\"Wandering Joy\\"). Subsequent to this book, Fox was expelled from the Dominican order in 1993.<br />At times Fox also seems to blame all that is ecologically corrupt on traditional Christianity, for example \\"Pantheism is not only democratic, it is also ecological, Theism, on the other hand, reinforces anthropocentrisms \\". Additionally he makes a broad claim that \\"Creation Spirituality\\" encompasses such broad divergent groups as \\"AA\\", Support groups, and Protestant parishes.<br />Though I agree with Fox's quest for a deeper ecumenism, he seems to pick what he wants out of the Christian tradition. I still find ample mining in a more traditional, though slightly broadened views of the Holy Trinity, rather than his Cosmology, Liberation, and Wisdom. Although I don't always agree with Fox, he does offer an injection of joy and awe.	2002-01-03

Fishman covers the more famous explorers such as Audubon, Muir, and Bartram but my appreciation goes to her for introducing me to some of the lesser known naturalists such as Hardy Croom who found new plants such as the Florida Yew, and the explorations of Dr. John Small and his weed wagon botanizing in the Everglades.  The nations appreciation should go out to Roland Harper for researching and helping to preserve the Okefenokee Swamp.<br />Fishman mixes the travels of the naturalist with useful background natural history, and her own trip through the area traversed by the naturalist.  Often this provides useful contrasts, but at times was superfluous; did it really add anything to the history to tell us that her car broke down or that the water in the campground shower was too hot?  At times she projects her own personal emotions into the historic figure for example of William Bartram &quot;He felt fear and must have sometimes felt a great loneliness&quot;.  At times she also projects modern sensibility  onto the times, for example  though we may all now agree that the plan to drain the Everglades was &quot;incredibly stupid&quot;, but it would have been more valuable to present an understanding of the culture of the late 1800's to understand this better.  Despite these criticisms, I appreciated this book and hope that perhaps she does a follow up of some of the more recent naturalists such as herpetologist Archie Carr or ornithologist Arthur Howell.	2002-01-03

Pascal emphasizes principles of relational design based on predicate logic and set mathematics in a nice blend of theory and practical hints.  He argues that many of the problems in using databases are a result of poor relational design.  For example, in discussing duplicates he advocates prohibiting duplicates and the use of keys.  Throughout he describes the problems if the data is not normalization.<br />My only complaint is that he regularly complains about the design of the SQL standard. For example \\"Due to numerous flaws in the design and implementation of SQL, the performance of SQL DBMS ... leads users to denormalize for performance\\".  As a user I have say over my design, but little sway over the SQL standard or my particular software package.  With regard to denormalizing, I think there is also a tendency to use flat tables in web page pages, so perhaps Pascal should go over developing tools to program relational tables easier with ASP pages.  I would have also appreciated his thoughts on dimensional modeling used in data warehouses.	2002-01-02

As an 11 year old he had an epiphanal experience in a meadow that gave him a new sense of reality.  Later as a priest of the Passionist order, he took the name Thomas after Thomas Aquinas, and is influenced by Aquinas' rediscovery of the universe and quotes from Summa Theologica.  The first two essays introduce his cosmology under the broad topics &quot;Economics&quot; and &quot;The earth: a new context for religious unity&quot;.<br />  The remaining seven essays present a critique of Berry. Almost all are appreciative of Berry's view point even if differing.  There are different perspectives offered on how strongly the Bible and the Redemption story should fit in to this evolving earth story.  Physicist Brian Swimme offers a scientific perspective, of &quot;science as a partner&quot;, on both the role of science in providing the story but also on the role of Berry in teaching to science.  Additionally Berry is critiqued from a feminist standpoint.  The book concludes with Berry's 12 principles for understanding the universe.<br />This book offers an introduction to Berry, and through the critiques and &quot;Questions for discussion&quot; after each chapter provides a useful whetstone for thinking about his new cosmology.	2001-11-21

I'm sure there is a latter edition, and probably due for an update.<br />Fairly serious, text book, and perhaps best in the early years, including folk, ragtime, blues and African influences.  Liberally sprinkled with great photos, some early ones include a 1895 photo of Buddy Bolten and a 1923 photo of King Oliver band with Louis Armstrong.  This book is probably most geared for the musician, with transcriptions from Lester Young, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane as well as many shorter musical passages through the text.<br />Although I'm sure everyone find some of their favorite musicians missing, Tirro offers many perspectives and tries to relate jazz to other cultural happenings, such as beat poets.  His chapter on &quot;Loose Ends&quot; attempts to fill in some of his omissions.  I would have liked to have seen more discussion on the role of evolving technology, for example without the more modern microphone a crooner like Frank Sinatra wouldn't have stood out.  I found his chronology and discography very helpful in keeping the history and music in context.  Readers would do well to have a copy of The Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz to listen along with the reading.	2001-11-21

The 1940's must have been an exciting time to be a jazz musician with Dizzy and Bird innovating wherever they went.  Early on are the influences of Pres (Lester Young), Coleman Hawkins, and Charlie Christian and countless other. The comradeship and competition at Milton's and Monroe's clubs, on 52nd street or after hours at apartments such as Mary Lou Williams was a very fertile environment.  Not many could keep up with Bird, and they acknowledge that some of the cuts were to keep lesser talented musicians from sitting in.  Gitler weaves these interviews together so skillfully that at times in seems the musicians are talking to each other.<br />The stories on the road are often funny, but also sad; segregation, discrimination, and drug use.  Some musicians emulated Charlie Parker's drug use so they could &quot;play like bird&quot;.  Gitler begs the question with the statement &quot;in spite of (or because?) (of the drugs) ... a great music was made&quot;.  As an aside, what other index can you find reference to both Nietzsche and Alan Greenspan?	2001-11-21

The &quot;shock of nonbeing&quot; and the ensuing anxiety allows Tillich to categorize three types of anxiety (fate and death, emptiness, and guilt).  I thought his history of anxiety, starting with the Stoics (&quot;the only real alternative to Christianity in the Western world&quot;) was remarkable (though at times a rough read).  Influenced by Heidegger and Kierkegaard(&quot;to confront his existence alone&quot;) he drives on to the inevitable search for God.  For Tillich, the &quot;Courage to Be\\" is partly the courage to despair, and avoid the &quot;Neurosis is a away of avoiding non-being by avoiding being&quot;.  He is also influenced by Freud and psychoanalysis (called &quot;depth psychology&quot; in the book),  which in our day of Prozac and behavioral psychology is refreshing.<br />The nature of the discussions, being, nonbeing, subjectivity, objectivity make for difficult reading with double negatives (eg. &quot;Nonbeing is no threat because finite being is, in the last analysis, nonbeing&quot;).  If one can wade through the language, there a lot of insight.	2001-11-21

Although the examples in this book are in VBScript this book should not be thought of as a reference for VBScript.  Though short, the examples were enough to start me using the features, for example setting a session timeout, using a collections reference or sending email from a script.  I did find the examples on the ActiveX Data Objects a little sparse and the author admits, \\"there are several more advanced topics\\".  I had previously found the global.asa file and #include files somewhat mysterious so this chapter was helpful.<br />With the availability of online documentation, I found the author advise about using the feature or limitations more valuable than details of the parameters.  There is enough of an introduction to give you the concepts in most areas.  Additionally the specification of what driver is needed for a component can be helpful if there are problems.  I will continue to use this book in conjunction with online documentation.	2001-11-07

For the bird watcher, you will learn why Sept 16 is the best time to be at Hawk Mountain in Pennsylvania.  For sheer magnificence the Sandhill Crane migrations through Nebraska can't be surpassed, and that story also offers lessens on the role of man; both positive (leaving corn in the field), and negative (loss of the Platte River).<br />For those wanting to understand the scientific process, the disagreement about the migration route over the Atlantic of the Blackpoll Warbler offers an example of the use of circumstantial evidence.  Sometimes the evidence seems too circumstantial, like infering Rufous Hummingbird migration paths from 2 banding returns.  Looking at scientific cooperation the tracking of Western Sandpipers along the Pacific coastline is remarkable,as is the international cooperation on White-rumped Sandpiper migration from the Arctic to the tip of South America.<br />All of these esteemed authors present well written accounts of the biology of migration. Readers who enjoyed this book might also enjoy Paul Kerlinger &quot;How birds migrate&quot; and Brian Harrington's &quot;Flight of the Red Knot&quot;.	2001-10-24

Two missing works were the Small Catechism and his speech at the Diet of Worms (&quot;Here I stand ... I cannot do otherwise&quot;).  In three key works from 1520 &quot;An appeal to the ruling class of German Nationality&quot;, &quot;The Pagan Servitude of the Church&quot; and &quot;The Freedom of a Christian&quot;, Luther develops (re-discovers?) the doctrine of justification by faith and emphasis on Scripture.  Luther steers from a legalistic life of a Christian (&quot;Beware lest you make Christ into a Moses&quot;).  He vigorously attacks the practice of indulgences, Papal Supremacy and the papal court: &quot;At present there is a crawling mass of reptiles, all claiming to pay allegiance to the Pope, but Babylon never saw the life of these miscreants&quot;.  At times he practices his own demagoguery; of St. James he does &quot;not hold it to be of apostolic authorship&quot;.<br />Luther attempts to remove the differences between cleric and public classes by opening the Eucharist to everyone and his German Bible made Scripture available to German peasantry.  Luther grants spiritual rights to the individual, and states importance of the Christian community, but he did not extend this politically, and should not be viewed as advocating political democracy.  The &quot;Appeal to the ruling class&quot; was popular among the nobility because it provided justification for not sending money to Rome.<br />After reading St. Augustine's Confessions, it is interesting to see how this Augustinian monk extends the idea of grace.  The works on free will were the most paradoxical for me.  He seems to argue both that without grace man is incapable of free will, but also that  &quot;God has taken my salvation out of the control of my own will&quot;.	2001-10-24

This edition starts with a helpful introduction of Lectio Divina reading (read, meditate, rest in God, govern one's actions) by the editors.  Thomas Moore (Care for the Soul) then presents the &quot;rule&quot; not as an edict but as a measure for spiritual progress.  He states monks have a sense of humor, but his Franciscan past is probably more open than Benedict's &quot;only a fool raises his voice in laughter&quot;.  According to the &quot;rule&quot; a lot depends upon the abbot, and the monk must accept the abbot's ruling, fair or not, as an exercise in obedience and prayer.<br />I think the rule has relevance even to a modern, non-monastic Christian life, by offering a model of rhythm and simplicity.  In this time of shaken confidence,  the twelve steps of humility is a refreshing thought.  The rule presents a challenge to the modern to &quot;Renounce yourself in order to follow Christ&quot;.	2001-10-24

Continuing a dialogue started over 30 years ago between Thomas Merton and the Dalai Lama, these talks at the Abbey of Gethsemani discuss 1) Practice of prayer and meditation 2). stages of growth, 3) the role of teacher, and 4) the goals of spiritual and social transformation.<br />The Dalai Lama sees the role of religion in alleviating human suffering, and the question for him is not which religion is right, but which is right for a particular person.  I thought the chapter on achieving Calm Abiding was most practical, with antidotes to &quot;the five faults&quot;, for example &quot;The third fault is laxity and excitement.  Its antidote is introspection&quot;.  Discussing spiritual life, he discusses the six perfections, and sees similarity between the Christian and Buddhist monastic traditions of morality, simplicity, and contentment.  Finally he discusses Nirvana, and the Christian goal of union with God. By sharing ideas between these traditions there is hope that tolerance, generosity, and love will be cultivated.	2001-09-13

As Eckhart says, &quot;anything we say of him (God) is bound to be stammering&quot;. Logic and scholastic experience cannot be used to dissect his writing. Eckhart uses metaphors, to give sign posts that hint at a deeper experience. There are paradoxical statements &quot;If I am empty, God, of his very nature is obliged to give himself to me to fill me&quot;. We may think of denying ourselves as a commandment, but for Eckhart it is a reward. There are statements that seemed heretical to the church at the time like &quot;To seek God by rituals is to get ritual and lose God in the process&quot;. I cannot claim to understand Eckhart completely, for example the difference between God and Godhead, but this small book warrants future readings.	2001-09-11

Smith writes about his experiences staying at Browns Cabin for four months, near timberline in the Sawatch range of Colorado. There is natural history of the animals he sees such as the pine martin and jay, and his reflection on the sometime unwelcome intrusions of visitors, back packers, and especially motorcycles. He at times writes idyllic, but also talks about taking 4 hours to wash his cloths. He does not filter, and at times appears as a curmudgeon, other times more gregarious, and always reflects how he reacts to both people and nature. He also gives a brief biography of his life ... which has some very personal moments about family deaths. Anyway, I respected him as a teacher, and now also respect his as a man. As an aside, some current info about Browns Cabin, shows that camping is not suggested because of hantavirus, so the place may now have the solitary that Dwight sought.	2001-09-11

Some the sins may seem seem minor, such as stealing pears as a lad, but the severity is not the issue for Augustine, but rather the nature of man toward evil (original sin). Throughout is a devotion to his mother Monica, and it may be her patience and faith that is the most profound story. This may be the first autobiography, and it is written from a distinctly post-conversion view point, such that everything in his early life if viewed as separation from God. There are events that are unique to the 4th century such as his friends devotion to the gladiator games, the Manicheism early religion and his understanding of their fatalistic view of evil, and Platonic discussions. Augustine bridges the classical Greek era and a medieval Christianity. The last few chapters build an allegorical exposition between Genesis and the creation of a Christian.<br />Augustine, perhaps more than any other defines the Christian self. He leads us between the pessimistic path of innate human depravity and the optimistic path of salvation through works. A conversion and grace experience must be given. His autobiography stresses the psychological, internal life of Christians.	2001-09-11

These compact stories all have deep issues about life and what it means to be human.  I was surprised by the feeling that God may be wresting with what it means to be God and allow humans freedom.  There almost seems to be a trial and error approach to creation.  The people in Genesis are all exposed as being very human, with fractured families.  The people on the video are also very human, and at time the discussions are very personal, like sitting in with an old friend.  This book and videos offered an amazing number of views, and one shouldn't view them as dogma.  I was particularly surprised by feminist and Koran views.

When he includes his first- hand experience the points are particularly well presented. For example, for Florida he presents his own work on insect re-colonization of mangrove islands. His discussion of community ecology and area-species equations were well done. We may like to think we know the world, but the chapter on number of unknown species is surprising! At times, it is not clear what is just his view, or which is a widely accepted among scientists. For example, I am not sure that the Energy-Stability-Area hypothesis is widely accepted as explanation of tropical diversity.<br /> His presentation of the value and ethic of diversity may not be for everyone, but is thought provoking. I would not agree with him that all developers understand the practical value of wild species. At times he comes across as an American biologist &quot;having the answers&quot; for third-world counties, rather than looking for deeper understand of these problems, that aren't purely biological.  I found Hecht and Cockburns &quot;The Fate of the Forest&quot; a deeper understanding of the issues in the Tropics.

Peppered with examples from his own research, and  scientists as Pastuer, Paul Ehrlich, and Darwin, Beveridge shows the importance of the  mind of the researcher.  Particularly powerful was the chapter (and appendix) on recognizing chance, as Pastuer states &quot;chance favors only the prepared mind&quot;.<br />Beveridge offers a nice contrast to an overly mechanist hypo-deductive method, and recognizes the value of hypothesis in guiding research as well as precautions in the use of hypothesis.  Unlike journals that refuse to publish mistakes, or graduate students who are afraid of failure, he offers Whiteheads &quot;panic of error is the death of progress&quot;.  Beveridge recognizes the role of chance, error, intuition, and creativity in the research process.  Although, many examples are from biology, the physicist should not be viewed as aloof from the need for creativity, and he quotes Einstein &quot;There is no logical way to the discovery of these elemental laws.  There is only the way of intuition ...&quot;.	2001-06-27

Into more recent times he cites Darwins example of studying behavior as well as Pavlov.<br />For the behavioral psychologist, the  names of Thorndike,  James Watson (who curiously left science for advertising),  B.F. Skimmer,and Harry Harlow are presented.  I particularly enjoyed the discussion of the heyday of ethology research from von Fisch's discovery of honey bee dances, to Konrad Lorenz's imprinted geese, and Niko Tinbergen's study of gulls.<br />Throughout the book are superb pictures, from all classes of animals, illustrating the animals associated with the researchers or the principles discussed.

He views religion as not having this doubt, but I would offer Paul Tillich as a counter example.  His chief area of conflict is with the metaphysical aspects of religion.<br />He has little patience either for sociology or psychology, pseudoscience or the ponderousness of philosophy.  In some ways he is still a &quot;kind in a candy shop&quot;, for example hob-knobbing with physicist at the Los Alamos lab, but never afraid of any of them when he is talking about physics.

For example, with Isaiah 51:1, &quot;You who seek the Lord, look to the rock from which you were hewn ....&quot; he offers thoughts on primordial instinct.  Perhaps more important than his own words, is the exercise he proposes to the reader, to come up with their own most important words.  Your list will be, as mine, different that Mr. Zettek's (mine included syncopation), but that's what makes it interesting .<br />His &quot;Hypothetical General Theory on the meaning of life&quot;, is perhaps a bit grand, first I would not agree that it is the first such &quot;published this century&quot;, and second, to me,  seems derivative of both Cartesian dualism, and transcendentalism.  I am not dismissing what he says, put perhaps agreeing with him that &quot;Man's thought is not transferable&quot;.<br />Finally after stretching the mind abstractly, Zettek offers a few pages of &quot;Maxims&quot;, some light hearted some wise., e.g. &quot;Memory is our real battleground&quot;.

These alone are not &quot;minor subjects&quot;, but warrant the introduction given here (and subsequent books).  The books title includes &quot;object oriented&quot; but is perhaps not emphasized enough.  I think the real value is getting the designer to think about the needs and dimensions early in the process.	2001-05-14

Its worth trying the examples as a learning tool, and the scripts and populated Microsoft Access database is available from the authors web site (along with a few errata).  If your using it as a reference, the nicely layed out contents, pages, and index provide for finding the information quickly.  ASP programmers who are writing SQL to access databases for the web will particularly find this a useful guide to constructing the SQL SELECT statements to retrieve data.  The book mentions more advanced features such as stored procedures and triggers which will at least give you a taste of things to learn.  I suspect that as readers databases grow slower, however they may be searching for more information on  indexing and keys.	2001-05-14

With deep austerity, and  prayer they follow a path utterly dedicated to a spiritual life.  Despite their austerity, there are at times a surprising expressions of personality, and even community among the solitaire cells and companionship of the monks. There are stories of hermits with lions  as companions, of sustainment of a few herbs or palm leaves, of them helping thieves stealing from them,  or selling Gospels to help the poor.  However these monks are humble in their faith, and a lesson often repeated in these stories is humility and compassion for temptations that they themselves feel. The temptations of women, and even a monks' expression of Pelagia &quot;the harlots&quot; beauty  was surprisingly sensuous.  It may seem impossible for us to be isolated like this, but we can quest for solitude as abbot Antony said &quot;Who sits in solitude escapes from three wars: hearing, speaking, seeing&quot;	2001-05-14

Despite wanderings and settlements from Spain, Eastern Europe, and Ethiopia, and Exiles and destructions of the Temple, they have remained &quot;The Chosen People&quot;.  This book helped me realize the uniqueness of this last century on the Jews, from the Holocaust to the importance of the creation of Israel.  The essays that Rabbi Dosick sprinkled through the book, offer a glimpse of a way of thinking about ethics, justice, and law.  He presents his personal views, for what they are, and recognizes other views.<br />The description of Jewish Holiday and Worship, describe the rituals and worship that historically permeate the Jewish life.  Growing up Christian, I felt some loss that we had discarded these remembrances of God from our daily life.  His own essay on &quot;Law and Spirit&quot; recognizes some of the differences in spirit between Christianity and Judaism.  It also helped me appreciate some of the Jewish observances, that as an outsider seem unusual.	2001-03-31

In addition to the parallels between this story and SK's relation with his father mentioned by previous reviewers, another important parallel is his failed engagement with Regine Olsen.  She is his Isaac, who he must sacrifice.  Perhaps he thinks his own calling,  means that he too can &quot;teleologically suspend&quot; the ethical (duties to Regine).  Its remarkable, that we now should be so concerned about the private live of a pseudonymous author.  Is Johannes de Silentio a poetic side of Kierkegaard? Poetic yes, but paradoxically he also says he is purely dialectic.<br />The different takes of the Abraham story, remind me of Rabbinical midrash.  The four different accounts did not happen, but they might have.  It is a way of stretching the story, and a way to introduce his &quot;faith by virtue of the absurd&quot;.  The tragic hero remains in the ethical, but Abraham is different that this, and is related to the Absolute.  Very thought provoking!	2001-03-31

Sanders combines versions Sumerian, Akkadian and Hittite texts. The prose flows very well (almost like the King James Bible). The introductory history and map provide helpful background information.<br />Its amazing though over 4,000 years old, that there are very modern elements. Here man first begins to define a &quot;self&quot;. There is dream interpretation that historically is continued with Joseph in the Bible and still alive with Carl Jung. Some symbols, such as the slaying of the Lion are ancient and almost universal. The Flood story shows up here, and perhaps latter repeated (or in a new form) in the Bible and Noah, with new meaning. What's fun about these myths is that they are compact and open to interpretation. For example, I perhaps see the defeat of Humbaba (the guardian of the Cedar Forest), as the start of our environmental crisis.	2001-03-31

The narrative worked best for me when he intersperses his own experiences, such as meeting his father-in-law, who fled Russia as a 16-year old boy.  I would have benefited from more descriptions of how the Jews developed history into ritual, such as Channnuka and discussion of changing beliefs (e.g., the current Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox branches) (Rabbi Dosick's  Living Judaism does this well).<br />This book presents common elements such as the contribution and personalizing of whatever community they are in, e.g., the development of Yiddish in Eastern Europe.  There is often a strong intellectual development and reawakening, such as the &quot;Sandhedrin&quot;, after the fall of Jerusalem. It is remarkable they have kept their identify despite wide spread dispersal and torture.  The irrational hatred for the Jews is troubling both in its intensity as in the Crusades, but also among &quot;learned people&quot; such as Voltaire and Martin Luther.	2001-03-31

There are poems from the Greek Nobel Laureate Odysseas Elytis, and Israeli soldier Yehunda Amichai.  Numerous poets are translated from central and South American, including a surprising poem from Jorge Luis Borges about Lee's soldier in the Civil War.<br />Looking at poetry anthologies, readers are left to form their own links between poems and this collection offers some startling ones.  With a theme of quilts and scraps, there is the Kentuckian Catherine Sutton's haunting &quot;Graveyard Quilt&quot; to Jean Valentines allusion to the Aids quilt.  Blood provides another common flow, for example Paula Allens' &quot;Blood flows in the cobbled alleys with all the filth&quot; .  These poems expose the readers to a wide range of styles and locales.	2001-03-31

This collection, continues his effort at ecumenism by bringing together 15 Protestant and 1 Jewish writer, and each sheds new light on the Papal volume.  Perhaps due to the ecumenical goal, there is less discussion of differences of faith, which also would have proved useful, such as Phyllis Tickles discussion of Catholic beliefs of purgatory. Particularly moving for me was Rabbi's Eckstein's, Jewish response, first about the history of Church-afflicted spirit, and more recently, the positive changes led by John XXIII and this Pope.  Flora Wuellners commentary of prayer, proved enlightening to me in terms of the transformative power of prayer, not as a means of begging for something, but as a means of avoiding fleeing from God.  Both this book and the book by John Paul II, discuss fundamental questions of faith, evil and suffering, and may help to deepen your own understanding of Christianity, whether Catholic or Protestant.	2001-03-31

I had a few problems getting the Personal Web Server and FrontPage to coexist, but this was addressed at the authors web site, mentioned in the book.<br />I particularly found the Classified Ads example (included on the CD) useful for learning to interface with an Microsoft Access database. The database examples are all with Microsoft Access.  All but one of the chapters was in VBScript, so this book might not be the best source if your interested JScript.  Its definitely worthwhile to work through the books examples.<br />The book concludes with web sites for more information and examples.  The appendix describes Visual Interdev as another platform for data access, but might also have mentioned capabilities in FrontPage.  Also new in Access 2000 are &quot;data access pages&quot; for another data access method.

This group offers more paradoxes than solutions such as: 1. The paradox of copying and refreshing digital data while maintaining integrity of the original.  2. The paradox of digitizing for access, but using paper for preservation (to go with a culture that already knows how to preserve paper).  When digital data corrupts it corrupts absolutely.  3.The paradox of individual ownership versus access to everything, and what incentive the owner has in preserving data.<br />As if to further punctuate the problems with digital preservation, the Getty Information Institute which sponsored that workshop no longer exists, many of the mentioned Web sites are gone, and the Time and Bits online forum has ceased to operate (though stored at &quot;long now&quot; web site).  Digital preservation can be little better than the cultural organization that supports it.	2001-01-15

From studying a 3000-year-old horse intaglio to looking for Anasazi granaries he seeks our ancestral relationships. The essays work best when he mixes his reflection with keen observations.  Where the essays have a heavier philosophical hand they aren't as effective.  As he says &quot;The door that leads to the cathedral is marked by a hesitancy to speak at all, rather to encourage by example, a sharpness of the senses&quot;.  Lopez 's narratives sharpen many senses from the sudden assault of the sound of snow geese to &quot;two snails small as pinheads chewing a leaf&quot;.<br />There are reflections on the role of biologists, from communicating between scientists and shipmates in the arctic to their role in a whale stranding.  Perhaps he thinks biologists have greater insight, but he also understands the need for mystery and direct experience.<br />For Paul Winter fans there is a description of the raft down the Grand Canyon that produced the album &quot;Canyon&quot;.  As a current update, the snow geese written about in one essay are continuing to boom and damage their arctic breeding grounds.	2001-01-05

A practicing Methodist, Smith had discussions with the Vendanta Society, does Hatha Yoga, and prays five times a day like the Muslims.  His perspective is not one looking for divisions within a religion, but as an outsider wanting to understand the experiences.  For example, in discussing Islam, he talks about the Sufis, but not about the division between Sunnis and Shi'ites.<br />This book is less about details, facts, and religious holidays, and more about the underlying meaning and unique insight of each religion.  E.g., in discussing Hinduism he looks at &quot;What people really want&quot;, about a wearing out of the material world.  In the chapter of Judaism he discusses meaning in history and justice.<br />The illustrations complement the text with a symbolic sense of the culture and beliefs.  Looking at a sculpture of a very sensual Shiva with consorts helps one realize that the Hindu view of pleasure may be different than your own.  The Buddhist and Taoism paintings project a sense of peace.  The photographs of the worshippers are very respectful.	2000-11-16

Merton looks at Christian writers like Meister Eckhart, e.g., &quot;The shell must be cracked apart if what is in it is to come out ... therefore if you want to discover nature's nakedness you must destroy its symbols...&quot;.  What ever Zen is, Merton recognizes that it is somehow there in Eckhart.  Merton outlines the differences also, in that Christianity is eschatological with the idea of salvation, grace and divine gifts.<br />Merton also grapples with whether Christianity is dualistic.  The intuition of God's presence and direct experience in a mystic like Saint Theresa or the desert fathers sounds similar to the quest for direct experience in the Buddhist.  The dialogue with the Zen teacher D.T. Suzuki in the book's second part further explores this dualism and differences.  I think this book starts a dialogue that will deepen both Christian's and Buddhist's understanding.	2000-11-14

This book supports traditional farming, and, at times, has a heavy-handed attack on agribusiness and its usage of soil, petroleum, and mined water.<br />Some of the most interesting essays included Wendell Berry discussing the mind of the farmer in &quot;Whose head is the Farmer Using&quot;, that is &quot;A farm as a human artifact inseparable from the mind that makes and uses it&quot;.  Gary Snyder's in &quot;Good, Wild, Sacred&quot;, looks at what sacred land might be with stories of Australian Aboriginal and Japan's native Ainu.

We reach a new level of awareness when we choose to approach the other as a Thou - as a relational being and not as an It. We don't find this by seeking an object, but by grace. This book is also about true dialogue (for example,  Hendrix - Getting the Love You Want).  Buber is worth the effort!	2000-10-11

Tillich recognizes the reality of doubt, for if we could possess Him like any other familiar work, God would not be God (and perhaps if we do not have doubts, we are limiting Him too much!).  Throughout the book, Tillich recognizes the message of &quot;divine foolishness&quot; (his phrase), and the role of the Holy in wisdom and meaning.  These are thought provoking sermons, particularly for those of an existentialist bent.	2000-09-28

Berry writes of fidelity to the land, sustainable farming, community, and marriage.  He writes reverently and with faith, but does not broach religion directly.  His poems speak for a longer time frame, of waiting to find out more (about the land or a partner).  On first reading you might think this is pastoral nostalgia, but is an exciting new view of community and stewardship.<br />The poems are very personal and Berry selects what to reveal.  He writes about marriage, despite &quot;the excitement of women and have desire for them in my mouth like salt&quot;.  He writes of what he learned from his father &quot;A steer should graze and thrive whenever he lowers his head&quot;.

To me its  unimportant how fictional it is, (Ravelstein is a thinly disguised version  of Bellows' University of Chicago Colleague Allan Bloom).  Recall that  Bellow's Humboldts' Gift was partly based on Delmore Schwartz.  Perhaps  fictionalizing, allow Bellow more freedom, or perhaps allow him to get  beyond a writers block of a true biography.  Ravelstein's surprising best  seller,  (like Blooms The Closing of the American Mind), presents his ideas  .. who he is.  Ravelstein is a man who &quot;lived by his ideals&quot;,  and directed them toward a circle of friends and colleagues.<br />What  Ravelstein (the man and the book) is about is friendship ..that spans the  passage of time, life and marriages. This is also a tale of the power of a  strong personalty (&quot;a character&quot;) on those around, and a man  using his intelligence on his friends, colleagues, and tangentially on  himself.  There are rich details on character and comic detail, that no  one does better than Bellow!	2000-09-08

Presented is a sense of progress in philosophy (perhaps for example from St Augustine, to Anselm's ontological argument, to Kant's denial, to Kierkegard's leap of faith). The interplay between the philosopher's ideas and the artist, writers, and scientists of the day is well introduced. The small section on Eastern and Western Philosophy is interesting, dealing with the two parallel civilizations approach to the problem of existence and the interplay between philosophy and religion.<br />This book is weak in developing the ideas and process of philosophy.  For example, after discussing Anselm's ontological argument about existence of God, when talking about Kant he misses a change to show how Kant &quot;disproved&quot; it. The ample photos and sidebars keep the text moving and the subject interesting. I used this book as a springboard to reading more about the philosophers that interested me.	2000-09-08

Although his rise and fall may be sad, what I am struck by here is the  breadth of his poetry.  As he says in his poem &quot;The Kingdom of Poetry:  &quot;Poetry is quick as tigers, clever as cats, vivid as oranges&quot;.  In his work, there are dark passages as &quot;The Heavy Bear that goes with  me&quot; on the clumsiness of physical body.  In contrast, there is the  joyous morning song of &quot;A small score&quot; with song of crickets and  the bubble of birds.  Throughout there is the juxtaposition of classical  images, as in &quot;Plato's cave&quot; and modern sensibility of the soul.  In the longer series of poems Coriolanus and His Mother, the Roman  characters of Brutus, and Marcius are interspersed with Freud and a  semblance of standup comedy.  I recommend this book, for its diversity  and depth ... some of the images have remained with me over a decade  now.<br />Those who have read his short stories &quot;In Dreams begin  responsibilities&quot; will enjoy the twist of the words in the selection  of poems in the section &quot;The Dreams which begin in  responsibilities&quot;.	2000-08-11

I am sure the Zen masters of this book, would give me a whack on the side  of my head, for writing a review, but here goes. The book brings together 4  original Zen sources.  The first, 101 Zen stories, presents koans and  parables. These can be confusing and amusing, such as the Sound of One Hand  Clapping, and One-finger Zen.  The Gateless Gate, by Mumonkan, further adds  to the syncopation, by offering seemingly random arguments about some of  the koans, and then concludes with a Zen students criticism of the rascal  Mumonkan.  So, the first two sections may be a multiple layered koan ...  and one is left mildly uneasy about the use of words for teaching Zen.  The  10 Bulls section and the Woodblock illustrations are beautiful poetry, more  accessible, and metaphors for the stages of enlightenment.  Finally,  Centering, is a transcript of a pre-Zen document, 4000 years old from  Kashmir.  It is surprising Zen like, for example a favorite: &quot;When in  worldly activity, keep attentive between the two breaths, and so  practicing, in a few days be born anew&quot; .  A great source book,  without interpretation.	2000-07-07

The use of Socratic dialog with Ishmael, is a clever way to engage the reader in Quinn's view about the role and origin of agrarian culture in our environmental crisis.  The idea of unspoken myths of &quot;mother  culture&quot; presented here (in contrast to the spoken myth as described  by Joseph Campbell), is, in my opinion, the book's most valuable  contribution.<br />Once engaged in this view, it is easy to find examples of  Leavers and Takers.  Recently on PBS was the story of the Viking failure  in Greenland. These conservative Protestants considered it sinful to adopt  the seal skin cloths of the Inuit, but the European styles were ill suited  for the Arctic.  It is the Inuit that still inhabit Greenland today (see  also, Give Me My Father's Body: The Life of Minik, the New York Eskimo by  Ken Harper)<br />  Ishmael's presentation is unique, but the views have been  covered elsewhere. Some of the more interesting twists such as the Cain and  Abel story were presented in Rene Dubos &quot;A God Within&quot;.  I would  recommend friends of Ishmael also read Dubos, for another perspective.	2000-06-16

Not one to despair of events, Dubos seeks positive values in man's relation to nature.  He  emphasizes the particular and the regional differences, the &quot;Spirit of  place&quot; that symbolizes the forces hidden beneath the surface and the  persistence of a psyche of place.  He does not conclude that mans  relationship must be negative, and takes heart in human altered landscapes  such as Britain's moors and in evidence of sustainable agriculture in Japan  and Amish societies of America.<br />Dubos does not blame the Judeo-Christian  tradition, but rather sees hope in Benedictine stewardship (as opposed to a  &quot;unrealistic&quot; Franciscan view) that make it possible to maintain  nature in a humanized condition.<br />He is not Pollyannic and recognizes  the &quot;Demon within&quot; .. the thrust of technology and institutions  that may run counter to living in harmony with nature.  I recommend this  book not because it offers simple answers, but because if offers a  well-read source of different perspectives.	2000-06-12

Lawrence with a thought of  cleaning the world, with &quot;No more people. Just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up.&quot;.  This sets the tone for a mystery, with 2  identical brothers, one researching  deadly bacteriological culture.  Sir  John Appleby, with the help of Lady Appleby prowling around an old school  attic, is off to solve his disappearance, in his civilized manner.  There  is a Wild Goose (well really a Wild Auk chase), to a secret island.  There  is enough fun in this book for everyone, especially bird watchers.  There  are also literate allusions like when referring to one the eccentricities  of one of the characters:. He has &quot; Prospero fantasies.  The sense  that he has supernatural aerial messengers at his command&quot;, which is  refers to The Tempest.	2000-05-24

Although perhaps more of interest  to the basketball fan, Jackson's Zen-Christian-Lakota insights into the ego  and anger of a high caliber (and $) team, and as a grand experiment with  the truth (to paraphrase Thich Nhat Hanh).  The use of Tex Winter's  triangle offense (five-man tai chi), as a team building exercise was  fascinating. His descriptions of his own awakening from a Pentecostal  background, and continual striving to understand deeper principles and make  mid-course correction not just to the team but himself.  As he says,  &quot;Being aware is more important that being smart&quot;.  A good read!	2000-05-12

The first section considers the seven words that were spoken TO the cross, rather than the customary seven words  FROM the cross.  The words from Mary and the Roman centurion gives a  framework for thinking what it means to be a Messiah and how at the time,  there was hope, even for Mary, that He be a political leader of the people.  Wright makes us think of what His death  and  &quot;Victory over  death&quot; means and what it means to be Son of God.<br />The second half of  the book contains eclectic sermons, such as the &quot;New Creation&quot; of  Christ's resurrection, the call and groaning of the Spirit, and of the  Eucharist.  This book provides powerful seeds of thought for Lenten  meditations	2000-05-12

Think about Y10K	This book offers great perspectives on time, our future and &quot;progress&quot;.  Forget megaflops, think about building the worlds slowest computer, something that will last 10,000 years, or a post office that will deliver after a millennium! The chapter on &quot;Digital dark  age&quot; is a must for any librarian or archivist (&quot;Digital storage  is easy ... digital preservation is hard&quot;). The building of a clock to  last 10,000 years may be a partial antidote to a society with attention  deficit disorder (See for example Faster: The Acceleration of Just About  Everything by James Gleick).  I would have been interested in more  specifics on keeping the clock running, and how to retain the organization  over time.  Will someone in 2,000 years still have the cultural context to  be able to read this book or keep the clock going?  I don't know if this  clock and library will ever be built, but I hope  so.	2000-04-13
US	52784843	R2HYRXOP8E8XBQ	0824510755	602135311	Replenish the Earth: A History of Organized Religions' Treatment of Animals and Nature--Including the Bible's Message of Conservation and Kindness T	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Broad coverage but not always deep	Broad encyclopedic study of Biblical references, but with little depth about social or historical forces that shape these.  For example, I would have liked some discussion of the Victorian Naturalist or the American  Transcendentalist. Addition there is no discussion about Creation  Spirituality of Thomas Berry or Matthew Fox.  Also I think the author has  unwritten assumptions, about what is right, such as vegetarianism.  I would  have also liked some discussion of the common ethical issues in the  cultures and religion and why the societies do not seem to match the ideals  of their respective religions.  There is still a lot of useful information,  and some common threads in all religions, such as the needless suffering in  animals and stewardship.  This is probably not a good first book, for  someone interested in the subject.	2000-04-12

If nothing else I will look for my Wotai stone, and hold it up to the rising dawn.  Perhaps I will beseech the  four directions and Mother Earth, Father Sky, and Wakan Tanka.  This book  can give anyone a greater appreciation of the stewardship of the Oglala  Sioux, and greater respect for Mother Earth.<br />This book provides  information on Indian ceremonies and the contribution of Indians to this  democracy. There are highly personal and remarkable accounts of Eagle Man's  own quest; such as the Yuwipi Spirit-calling ceremony to find a downed  airplane, and the finding of his personal tipi canyon agate.	2000-03-08

Perhaps he was on a trip to visit &quot;Old Doc Log&quot;. Old Doc Log provides a good patient ear, year round to listen to  your problems and put them in perspective.  This is not a quest for the  most beautiful, any log will do, even at a display in the museum!  This  book has some beautiful photographs (even of &quot;Old Doc Log&quot;), and  provides a good perspective on the subtler colors in Minnesota such as late  fall.  The pictures of Moose from the Rockies, are some of the most  exciting, and the three bull battle makes the staged wrestling seem like  silliness.  Some personal favorites include photographs of a great grey  owl, and a very flat marmot, trying to avoid detection of a golden eagle.  I heartily recommended book!	2000-03-06

There are a lot of just fun stories; from a father that boats down the Ohio River to joke telling in the family.  Growing up in  Pittsburgh, she has  a sense of place, a perhaps distorted history that all  children have, of the Carnegies and Mellons, of steel and the Allegheny  River.  Throughout these threads, is the expansion of the interior life.  There is also a discovery of her own intelligence, and her declaration as  &quot;Intelligensia&quot;.  At times this is overdone in the book,  seemingly ingenuine,  a projection of her adult intelligence onto her own  life as a girl.	2000-03-06

In this collection, we are treated to some of his early work &quot;Adam and No Eve&quot; (1941), to some of his last &quot;Galatea Galante&quot; (1979),  as well as a previously unpublished complete story  and an incomplete  fragment (with the note :Its much easier to begin a thing than to finish  it) found in his papers after his death.<br />The common thread in these  stories is Bester's flabbergasting imagination.  His stories are often  ironic, taking a wry observation about current society, and projecting it  to its logical conclusion into an absurd future, from the quest for poets  in an efficient future of &quot;Disappearing act&quot;, to the drop of acid  that makes a test tube woman intriguing in &quot;Galatea  Galante&quot;.<br />As one of the inventors of science fiction, Bester not  only lays the ground work for the popular themes of science fiction such as  the last couple on earth, time travel, androids and their programming, but  adds his own twists: a man needing an agent to sell his soul to the Devil  (of the company Beelzebub, Belial, Devil, and Orgy), collectors in the  future recreating a 1950's style room, and a chaos compensator.	2000-01-10
