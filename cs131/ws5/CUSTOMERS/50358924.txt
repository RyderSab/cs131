US	50358924	R40R5SZ0T2TYD	0300093527	337499350	The Fall of Hong Kong: Britain, China, and the Japanese Occupation	Books	5	2	14	N	N	A political analysis	Caution: the khaki cover and exciting illustration of the jacket of this book may make the prospective reader think it's military history. It's not, instead it is much more in-depth as a political analysis of the way in which the sudden disaster of the fall of Hong Kong irretrievably changed the colony into a more tolerant and far more Chinese place, ready for the 1997 hand-over. <br /> <br />The story does need to be written of the last stand of the misnamed Winnipeg Grenadiers, a Canadian unit of the defence who despite the implications of their being \\"British\\" grenadiers were completely unprepared for front-line combat. <br /> <br />Indeed, a movie-maker like Australia's Peter Weir (Gallipoli) needs to tell the story, which Snow rightfully downplays, of what it is actually like to be seconded to a doomed offense as in Turkey, or an equally doomed defence of Hong Kong, in BOTH CASES to assuage the vanity of a highly overrated Winston Churchill. <br /> <br />The story of defeat, occupation, and retaking is a series of gaps in time which as Snow shows mean breakages and breakdowns in daily life, which policy-makers systematically ignore. <br /> <br />Americans, for example, fancied no fissure between Saddam Husayn's rule in Iraq and a democratic \\"handover\\" to the right sort of chaps, and under their feet opened what opened under the Japanese in 1941, and, to an extent, under the reoccupying British in 1945: the irruption into daily life of the Hobbesian substructure. <br /> <br />In Baghdad this was an interesting combination of high-level opportunists and lowlife, and it parallels the story Snow tells of the way in which elements of the Triad gangs entered and left governance depending on the convenience of the Japanese and British. <br /> <br />It's in other words and in another register Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away and the use of the underclass in uniform and out to satisfy the vanity of comfortable men. It's also the confusion in the public mind of representation with the things represented. <br /> <br />The transition was less from Britannia to Nippon and back again than Britannia to chaos to Nippon and back again, where the chaos, and being bombed and starved by friendly fire (Americans based in the Phillipines both bombed Hong Kong and interdicted rice shipments) is the reality from which most people never recover. <br /> <br />The West needs to learn from China about reluctance to use military force. Snow is puzzled by Chou En-Lai's restraint over the issue of Hong Kong because it is the Western statesman who doesn't eat with chopsticks and has had a tendency to bite off more than he can properly digest. <br /> <br />In the West, the British showed the most restraint in their long-passed Empire, coupled with a systematic tendency to annoy Asians. This can be exagerrated: until recently, the British were proud of the relative quiet of Basra but this quiet is now known to be illusory. But in contrast to the American and the Spanish empires, the British empire was free of ideological preaching, whether about \\"democracy and markets\\" or the need for Inquisitions and autos, da fe. <br /> <br />We need to encourage the Chinese in their wise and rather unmilitary foreign policies, where the juncture between British and Chinese domination was in 1997 a party in Victoria Park and not a bloody mess. We need also not to be smug about the return of barbarism as perhaps Hong Kongers were in the 1930s, for Iraq shows us it's always on the menu. <br /> <br />America's Henry Kissinger has recently stated it quite brutally. In addition to accepting without thinking Clausewitz' dictum (war is a continuation of policy by other means because unlike the actual Clausewitz, the statesman doesn't have to endure the physical rigors of the field anymore), policy under globalization has come to mean for each country the lessening of respect for sovereignity of other nations, which just happens to undergird international law, in thename of the more powerful country's \\"vision\\", a polite label for greed and fear. <br /> <br />In this context, both military history and Snow's political history usefully remind us of how this makes places like Hong Kong a bloody mess overnight, in a way that Americans see only on TeeVee.	2005-10-04
US	50358924	RX78244K1AGOX	0521531829	32948398	Upheavals of Thought: The Intelligence of Emotions	Books	3	17	46	N	N	Not enough upheaval	Martha Nussbaum presents a reasoned and passionate defense of the role of emotions in thought which unfortunately devolves to too much \\"reading\\" and not enough analysis, in my view. <br /> <br />A fascinating quirk of language, which I discovered while teaching English in Hong Kong and grammar of the form found in \\"I feel sad that my mother has passed away\\", is that this proposition, which plays a rule in Upheavals of Thought, can be translated with only some change in meaning to \\"I feel sad because my mother has passed away\\". <br /> <br />To see the small but significant change in meaning, make another change to the sentence to read \\"I feel pain because I have a toothache\\". Note that this sentence now cannot be translated back to \\"I feel pain that I have a toothache\\". It's understandable in the manner of Malapropisms that are the bane of the English as a second language speaker, but cries out for correction, because the copula \\"that\\" links not a physical feeling with a state of affairs but an emotion, which may include but is not restricted to a physical feeling in ways explored, as Nussbaum shows, by Proust. <br /> <br />The Logical Positivist equivocated physical feeling with emotions but as Nussbaum shows, emotions are linked with states of affairs in a different way than physical feelings. <br /> <br />\\"Because\\", which refers to physical cause and effect, is the adequate copula to link an internally verifiable state of affairs such as toothache pain to an externally verifiable state of affairs such as an actual abcess. It inadequately encompasses, as we have shown, the range of meaning in \\"that\\". <br /> <br />In Nussbaum, feeling emotion \\"that\\" is the propositional contemplation of a state of affairs which necessarily changes when our knowledge of that state of affairs changes, and this is dissimilar to feeling either emotion \\"that\\" or  \\"because\\". <br /> <br />The psychiatric patient feels sadness because of a happy event, or one that we think is unrelated to his \\"flourishing\\", to use Martha Nussbaum's word. For example, she might be inordinately sad \\"over the death of an actress named Eva Peron\\". She also feels sadness that Evita has died as she contemplates the media reports, and her sadness-that perhaps need to be alloyed by Che Guevera's reflection on the manipulation of emotions in a Fascist society. <br /> <br />Whereas the fully healthy woman like Nussbaum herself feels both sadness-that and sadness-because of her Mother's death, and we accept this as normal. Both types of sadness follow the facts in ways we accept as normal. <br /> <br />If Ms. Nussbaum were to have an experience recently reported by the computer executive Steve Jobs, who learned in the morning that he had an inoperable cancer, only to learn in the afternoon that the cancer was curable as it was cured, her normality means that the emotion changes with the facts without being identifiable with the facts in some sillyassed Behaviorism. <br /> <br />Indeed, were she to find on arrival at the hospital that her mother was alive, the sadness-that would change while the physical manifestations of sadness-because might remain in the manner of a hangover. The emotion would change to relief that her mother was alive and that she could speak important words to her, coupled perhaps with anger that the report was false. <br /> <br />The physical feelings (of exhaustion or adrenalin-induced anxiety) might remain and this would be roughly described as a physical feeling of sadness still linked to the false report of death. But its name would change from \\"sadness\\" to something like \\"post-traumatic stress\\". And note that one reason why the word \\"stress\\" names the situation of people in economic and job circumstances which cannot be questioned is that \\"stress\\" can be spoken of without the \\"that\\" nonsense. \\"I feel angry that my boss is a Yuppie pig\\" changes to \\"I feel stress\\". <br /> <br />Now, the problem is that I miss this level of analysis in Nussbaum, to find it replaced by a sequence of readings that culminate with a singular lack of suspense to the American way of feeling, and are based on slaveowner philosophies of the ancient world, whose material basis Nussbaum fails to interrogate. <br /> <br />In earlier works, she made space in Hellenistic philosophy in philosophical circles for Hypatia and other female participants without historicising Greek philosophy or demonstrating as did Derrida its aporias, and how those fissures are \\"real things\\" that infect the way we think now. <br /> <br />Nussbaum fails to critically analyze false consciousness and one of its major supports, false feeling such as was used to justify the Iraq war, because such analysis, necessarily political, is a no-fly zone in the American academy. <br /> <br />Since our emotions, while being different from physical states of affairs, are reportable as states of affairs, emotions and facts form as PR men know a closed system in which it can be easier to manipulate emotions than to govern. <br /> <br />Americans hypostatize a set of emotions accepted as valid and narrated in a single way. Nussbaum encountered, in Finland, a different way of emotional expression but doesn't consider that emotional syntax may not be the only thing to change.  <br /> <br />We assume that other people feel a describable set of emotions isomorphic to ours while expressing them in different ways. The almost-modal case is that of the woman who acts as conduit to the dominant, but emotionally inarticulate, male and who like Evita adopts the intercessory role. She is apt to describe the leader as actually feeling feelings which she and not Peron feels, but to claim that el Maximo is inarticulate about his compassion for the descamisados, with a pitying and superior smile. <br /> <br />For example, I was very disturbed at the was Posner's \\"Law and Economics\\" so neatly deprives poor people of access to the courts where the former convenience of saving the time of court officershas replaced Aristotle's \\"equity\\"  and the quality of mercy itself, by imposing completely inappropriate metrics on the one venue in which \\"your day in court\\" was formerly a suspense of metrics. I made my concerns known to Nussbaum in email who graciously responded, however with the unsatisfactory explanation that Posner was some sort of bad boy who liked to shock people out of a complacency which in my case doesn't exist. <br /> <br />The alternative possibility is that an entire generation now coming to power is emotionally stunted in an unprecedented way, and this is on display in the conduct of the current Administration: but I don't see any critical reflection on this dangerous topic in Nussbaum. <br /> <br />My theme, missing in Upheavals, is that feminism and American culture, have narrowed \\"feelings\\" in celebrating them and made us remarkably provincial about feelings, with one result being the disasters of our foreign policy. <br /> <br />For example, feelings about birth happen to be radically different, in my experience, in mainland China and these feelings track the ready availability of abortion. <br /> <br />In America, even the pro-choice have been schooled by the political activity of the pro-life to take birthing and childcare with a great deal of seriousness, that form of external seriousness characteristic of moral panics, where the pro-choice are alarmed by the vehemence of the emotions expressed by the pro-life, feelings which in terms have a generally unreported class-linked subtext, having to do with the injustice of the way in which a woman's entire prospects change in the lower middle class when she becomes pregnant, and also having to do with the injustice done to her mate, whose career and life prospects are also stunted by pro-life moral panics. <br /> <br />More generally, Americans take the feelings of others, and their own, for granted in an environment where the layering of traditional psychoanalysis is in disrepute. To reflect that in China, government family campaigns and the widespread availability of abortion might make a Chinese woman feel quite differently about reproduction may trouble an American woman like Mrs. Clinton who while she wants women to have equal rights has also been schooled to accept and celebrate the necessary conservatism of people on lower rungs about reproductive choice and personal responsibility, a conservativism made necessary by the end of \\"welfare as we know it\\" and the end of any real reproductive choice in many rural areas of the USA while Roe v Wade remains on the books. <br /> <br />This isn't quite the same thing as \\"moral relativism\\", because ethics has long recognized that if a bad act is unaccompanied by the guilty mind, its badness is lessened or in the case of the \\"M'Naghten rule\\" in law, eliminated despite our dismay at the suffering of the victim (which in the case of first-term pregnancy may not exist, as Peter Singer points out). <br /> <br />The problem with reading unaccompanied even by my crude examples of \\"ordinary language\\" analysis is that the vivid images of reading reduce purity of heart, that purity of moral seriousness (as opposed to moral panic) where like Kant we retain the conviction that there are good and bad acts while not enumerating their empirical content.  <br /> <br />Moral panic can be induced by feminist reading. This happened in the case of Catherine MacKinnon's needed and valid redefinition of pornography as violence against women which became a censor's tool in an America where our sexy porn can and does include and encode political dialogue about our pursuit of a happiness which for most Americans is an intimate joke. To ascend to James Joyce by way of Whitman, the Bronte sisters, Dante and St. Augustine is to arrive (as does Orwell in Keep the Apsidistra Flying) at a lower middle class \\"adjustment\\" to intolerable lives by repeating Molly Bloom's \\"yes\\" in times of stress in the manner of the business self-help book. <br /><br />Whitman asked, courageously, for much more than was coming to him in a nineteenth century context where his homosexuality was unmentionable, and is answered in Nussbaum's sequence of readings by a crabwise retrograde movement with which many Americans have become all too acquainted in recent years: that of a content-free affirmation that is also found in the music of the later Stravinsky and in that of composers under continual pressure like Dmitri Shostakovich. <br /> <br />My fat and it must be admitted prolix pal Adorno merits only a few footnotes in Upheavals of Thought which is a shame, for Minima Moralia in particular is a critical analysis of emotions in lives where the state of affairs is not atomic or restricted to the death of a loved one but global in that we globally can say our lives have been irretrievably damaged by exogenous events. <br /> <br />Part of emotional work in today's America needs to be empathy for the emotions of the Other. For example, reading 20th century history and Adorno might help us understand that great mystery of Baby Boom Americans, which is the reconstruction of the emotional life of their parents.  <br /> <br />And, of course, we need to access Islamic emotional life, which starts with acknowledging how as in Shenzen emotions don't necessary precede the law. For example, we've never realized how Islamic women feel empowered by choosing traditional garb while knowing that their freedom of the will is unharmed, or, historically, knowing that Islamic people in general feel that their religion, by incorporating Christian prophets, is more \\"civilized\\". <br /> <br />A great deal of work needs to be done on the emotions, long equivocated by the indirect influence of Logical Positivism with toothaches and alcoholic hangovers. However, Nussbaums' account is a one-dimensional track which sends the message that Americans are the best emoters on the planet despite their inexperience with the damaged life.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-02

To educate educators in how to educate sounds great (especially if one has no ear for language).  <br /> <br />To many political conservatives, whose real concern is not spending much money on the needs of the next generation, such an effort implies the ability to increase the surveillance and monitoring of teachers according to \\"objective\\" criteria. <br /> <br />But comes now a book on the topic of teaching English as a second language which illustrates the tragic paradox of educating educators. <br /> <br />Educating educators contains the paradox of infinite regress, for educational \\"theory\\" replaces enthusiasm and a lived or learned, or both, acquisition of subject matter: the ideal educational system might well consist in a forced draft of the wealthy and successful, who would have the duty to society to spend two years teaching the least well off. As long as they could project or feign the enthusiasm, this might be more meaningful than the current system. <br /> <br />This book tries and fails to enunciate general principles for teaching English as a foreign language but its first maxim or saw should be \\"love English\\". No lover of English would use the nonword \\"appropriacy\\" for appropriateness but here it is a section heading and used in several locations. <br /> <br />It pretends that we can classify people according to styles and abilities which the teaching process itself fosters and creates, or discourages and destroys. <br /> <br />It contains a few good ideas but altogether too much emphasis on the pseudo-democracy of group work which in my experience is dominated by the psychos and bullies in the classroom and which causes gifted students to tune out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The English teacher's companions should be instead The Oxford Reference Grammar and Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage.	2005-09-07
US	50358924	R16YR5M3RFX8EO	0140041575	696665581	Saint Jack	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Quick read, highly recommended for expats and tourists	Theroux is a well-traveled, workmanlike writer with a fondness for the raffish and louche, apt to find in it a premature redemption in order to wind things up in a snappy Yank fashion. To his credit younger and shallower readers think he has a Bad Attitude, which is one of the names under which Moral Seriousness goes these days. <br /> <br />Saint Jack's original may be found throughout the formerly Far East, on many a bar-stool and in many an AA meeting. The hero of this novel is undistinguished by wealth or fame and is instead of the so-called Greatest Generation, who served in WWII. <br /> <br />Writers of the immediate postwar like Bellow celebrated the American \\"logistical tail\\", which was extensive and included any number of typists; Tommy Wilhelm in Seize the Day, for example, flew a desk.  <br /> <br />This may have been for the writer a labor-saving device. Having the character serve in a rifle platoon would mean the writer would have to deal with the large issue of how the combat affected the hero. <br /> <br />As the reader, you should realize that Saint Jack is a creature of the 1970s and a Singapore that is, as the guy below me in the postings here says, no more. He dates in other words from an era when a middle-aged and undistinguished guy could carry a message, the twilight of the Common Man as opposed to the trooping masses, destined, if they know what's good for them, only for approved lifestyles, dragging the kids to Disneyland, or Camp Snoopy in Sha Tin, their hopes for a better world downsized permanently. <br /> <br />Thanks to the guy below me for the suggestion of Theroux's novel Kowloon Tong. I shall definitely give it a read. <br /> <br />One great benefit from reading Saint Jack was a number of jokes, wheezers and gaspers popular twenty years ago in the saloon bar of the Peninsula or Raffle's after the women had left the room, to conspire.	2005-08-29
US	50358924	R3I4CR3XTRIJGT	0393051447	550346223	Khrushchev: The Man and His Era	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Couldn't put it down	This is a very readable book, based on solid research in newly opened Soviet archives, which brings the Dosteoevskyan figure of Khrushchev, the wise yet simple fool in *bast* shoes, to life. <br /> <br />While directed at the popular reader, almost one-fourth of the book is a scholar's resource, in the form of extensive footnotes. <br /> <br />Marx predicted that history repeats itself as farce while pondering the transition from Napoleon to France's farcical Second Empire. Khrushchev was an intimate and confidante of Stalin who (like Stalin himself) lacked the polish and education which so threatens managers of the bureaucratic *apparat* (whether Soviet, or Western corporate). <br /> <br />By playing the fool and by being in fact complicit with Stalin's crimes, Khrushchev survived with a relatively undamaged personality unlike Kaganovich or Beria and retained enough humanity to trigger one of the most important events of the 20th century, the 1956 revelation of Stalin's crimes by the Stalinist apparatus, a revelation which bears Khrushchev's name. <br /> <br />Modern American neocons owe in fact a debt to Nikita Khruschev which they will never acknowledge, for many world-historical crimes are never acknowledged by the implicated leadership, including the Armenian genocide (which to this day the Turkish leadership fails to acknowledge) and Tiananmen Square. In fact, Europeans including the impossible French were the first, in the generation of Foucault and Derrida, to realize the philosophical implications of a movement, based on a historical-materialist outlook, incapable as was Stalinism of self-application. <br /> <br />Nikita Khrushchev fell from view after the 1964 coup which brought the unimaginative and incompetent Leonid Brezhnev to power. His last years are indeed Dosteoevskyan in which he had to deal with his complicity in crimes that the leadership knew to be crimes (giving the lie to any story that Marxists are amoral) and expressed his willingness to bein prison, or homeless. <br /> <br />Taubman brings Khrushchev's family to life: in particular, Mrs K was no cardboard *matrushka* doll but instead tough as nails. Life in the *nomenklatura* was clearly no picnic because essentially, it seems, one was living on an expense account, in a *dacha* equivalent to a Marriott Residence Inn today, which could be revoked at any time. Perhaps this explains today's emphasis on private property in the Soviet Union. It's nice to go home every night without worrying whether the locks have been changed. <br /> <br />During Khrushchev's tenure, Americans actually believed that actually existing Socialism in the USSR might overtake its system. Certainly, everyone in the USSR was getting a decent education which is more than can be said for America today and Khrushchev's agricultural schemes were in Taubman's account partially successful. <br /> <br />However, by exagerrating (through ignorance or deliberately) the size of Khrushchev's rocket forces, the Americans forced Brezhnev into an arms race. Under Khrushchev, as Taubman shows, the conventional Soviet forces were significantly reduced and because Nikita the K was convinced of the unwinnability of nuclear war, Khrushchev chose to make threats of nuclear destruction...based at the time of the Berlin crisis in 1961 on four rockets, each with liquid fuel, that needed 30 minutes of preparation time. <br /> <br />Had a nuclear exchange occured over Berlin or Cuba, it might have not quite been the end of the world, for America's vastly larger force would have rendered much of Eurasia uninhabitable while sparing America in large measure, given the imbalance of forces. It would have also opened Eisenhower or Kennedy to comparisions with Hitler and made Latin America unlivable for Americans and their interests. To their credit, neither Eisenhower nor JFK actually thought nuclear war to be an acceptable option at the crisis. <br /> <br />But Taubman's \\"revelations\\" (which aren't really revelations but instead background facts which we now know because of the opening of Soviet archives) make it clear that American power is based on a rhetorical trick of creating an opponent, from Khrushchev to Saddam Hussein, with a base of real power (four out of date ICBMs, or the Iraqi army before 1991) and a rhetorical penumbra of complete fantasy. <br /> <br />\\"Negative capability\\" is the way in which the apparatus uses the worst in us and actively eradicates the best in us. Khrushchev was useful to Stalin precisely because of his relative lack of polish, and Khrushchev, said by Taubman to be \\"natively\\" intelligent in the way historians always credit successful players of the game with some sort of brutal shrewdness, which we are then called on to admire in a process which brutalizes us, was not especially intelligent in any meaningful way...as the Cuban crisis showed. <br /> <br />Stalin was useful to Lenin because Stalin had no original ideas and only at the end of his life did Lenin realize what a void Stalin was. Khrushchev, who on Taubman's account appears to have been clinically manic-depressive by 1960 fortunately repeated the process mostly as farce. <br /> <br />However, one grows weary of these celebrations, whether of Khrushchev or Putin, which celebrate only successful thugs.	2005-08-03
US	50358924	RK1D4L3VEWJL5	0743255461	937109510	The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Fascinating look into a moral black hole	Paul O'Neill thinks that the Bush Inner Ring, consisting of Cheney, Rice and others while excluding O'Neill and Colin Powell, consists of \\"ideologues\\" who replace thought and hard, thought-based choices with simple ideological principles. <br /> <br />But at the center is not an ideology in the sense of Marxist or conservative ideology. It is if an ideology a negative ideology summed up by what appears to be Karl Rove's operating principle: \\"do what the base wants because nobody knows anything\\". <br /> <br />O'Neill is unable to bring himself to realize that the sea-change he witnessed goes deeper than hard, conservative ideology. <br /> <br />As he realizes, a conservative ideologue would have trouble with the social engineering of a tax cut in the trillions, that assumed that rich people would invest their savings in new businesses. As it happens, much of the planned investment may be evaporating, from an American point of view, offshore to software development and other high tech firms in India and China, and much of the rest has been spent on a global housing boom, which, being global, only partly benefits Americans in \\"prime\\" cities like New York and San Francisco (with Milwaukee, for example, being distinctly out of the loop). <br /> <br />Conservatives objected, strongly, to the assumptions of social engineering implicit in JFK's tax cut. <br /> <br />What O'Neill calls \\"ideology\\" bears no resemblance to any ideology I know of. Instead, it is Rove's willed ignorance and the imaging of a \\"base\\" consisting of the worst and most vulgar sorts of nouveau-riche Americans, which happens to be a shifting class owing to the criminality and foolishness of this base. That is, today, it consists of individuals so overleveraged with mortgage debt that they fancy themselves plutocrats, only to change in months to a new set of equally deluded fools. <br /> <br />No writer has yet penetrated into the real mystery of the Bush administration whose conduct is sharply unlike that of any previous administration except, in certain respects, that of Warren Harding, for, it seems, special and anonymous interests have penetrated, apparently through Cheney, deep into the heart of this darkness. <br /> <br />This has been a slow train coming for in my experience in American business, \\"hip irony\\" has gradually replaced moral seriousness and truth-to-power. In Cheney's and Bush 43's generation, \\"conservatism\\" is only a pose which covers \\"what's in it for me\\", masked with a smirk. <br /> <br />As a citizen, one becomes along with O'Neill, an honest man, a Kremlinologist, reasoning from mysterious and indirect quantum effects because it's so clear that this administration WANTS to be a black hole...as its strictures about leaks affecting favored team members, its looseness about leaks that damage the outer ring including O'Neill and Powell, and its attempts to destroy records make clear. <br /> <br />For example, the failure to fire Donald Rumsfeld after his astonishingly poor management of Iraq on Bush's own terms, in which Rumsfeld sacrificed lives to an underpowered invasion of the south of Iraq while yammering nonsense in press conferences, was a signal \\"quantum\\" event which can tentatively be interpreted to mean that Rumsfeld has the ability to reveal criminal conduct on Cheney's and on Bush's part, to confirm, for example, under oath, that the Downing Street memo is on the level, and that an invasion of Iraq was planned from day one (this is confirmed by O'Neill). <br /> <br />The remarkable focus on victory on the part of the Bush team may be so intense because by now, defeat on any front will mean massive personal liability up to and including jail time for the inner ring, and confrontations with September 11 family members and family members of military casualties in American courts...that will destroy not only Bush but his thug family as well. <br /> <br />O'Neill is a decent man, but clearly unequal to seeing through Dick Cheney into the Heart of Darkness. He is in fact a dying breed, the American CEO concerned not only with profits but also with workers and the environment. The book, obviously written by a Ron Suskind who's a fan of Paul O'Neill's, foregrounds O'Neill's push for African aid, which taking place in 2002 was far in advance of Tony Blair's public relations drive, which was clearly planned to counterbalance Bush's complete lack of compassion or empathy. <br /> <br />This is because Paul O'Neill, with an Irish name, put himself through college and worked upward in the corporate ladder in a fashion that is now unfashionable. <br /> <br />Like John Major, O'Neill never mastered the rich kid's art of never speaking truth to power. <br /> <br />	2005-07-05

The authors believe that mathematics is less about an ideal world of forms and more emergent from daily work. For this reason they reference their examples to practical examples of the sort popular in the Soviet Union in the 1960s taken from heavy industry. <br /> <br />The section on computer technology, of course is useful primarily to the antiquarian. <br /> <br />Because the authors are not excessively formal in the Western mode the student has to do extra work to derive results they illustrate with physical metaphors in some cases. <br /> <br />There's also a certain motivation here to sing the praises of Russian mathematicians which is fortunately subordinated to the truth. As such, the book is a document from a period when Russia's greatness was based on its prowess in science and mathematics, prowess based on a universal availability of public education. This resource has been sold to Western investors for pennies on the dollar with no plan to reproduce it for the next generation, which is rather sad.	2005-05-27
US	50358924	R2YSI09ENIPDA7	1558604421	857991085	Programming Language Pragmatics	Books	4	21	97	N	N	Not just for compiler developers. A little too much RISC	I agree that every compiler writer (not engineer: programming is a cruelly difficult writing *sui generis*, not engineering) needs this book but its market is or should be much wider.    There is NO way to learn programming except at the intersection between compiler writing and applications programming, and it is a MISTAKE to teach programming as either a context-free application programmer's worship of machines and authority, or as the acquaintance with one programming language, its mistakes of design and implementation included, as Eleusinian mysteries demanding reverence.    Dijkstra, famously, described programming as applied mathematics. The concept of \\"applied\\" introduces an ineradicable tension between one discipline and another where the key ability is the ability to shuttle between layers of representation.    Crude language speaks airily of the needs of the user, where the user is hypostatized, singular, male, and imaged as wealthy and lacking taste. The actuality is that the relationship goes in computing all the way down, one user is also a worker for another, and only a programmer who has mastered his trade understands the need to transcend, in the course of understanding, the relationship.     Thus this book is useful not only to the compiler writer but also to the application programmer, because (for example), the application programmer has to understand at least in general terms how the For or Do construct of his language is evaluated.    He's importuned instead to meditate upon business needs with the result that something like 80% of large systems fail.    A programmer who, in Visual Basic, does not understand that For intIndex1 = 1 To intLimit - 1 is not \\"inefficient\\" because the expression is evaluated by value, doesn't know his trade. A programmer who, in C, doesn't know that while ( intIndex1 = 0; intIndex <= intLimit - 1; intIndex++ ) IS inefficient insofar as the expression is repeatedly evaluated doesn't know his trade, and the book is fullof useful information about these important semantic issues.    Many programmers use the totally inappropriate automobile metaphor to describe the computer and in so doing they declare that no more than they would look under the hood of their car, they should be freed of important issues of semantics and if possible coherent and readable syntax in their mindless coding.    The metaphor confuses a force and energy determined system with an information engine. It also encapsulates a narrow understanding, restricted to America and other energy-wasteful societies, of what it means to relate, even to cars, for the atypical but thrifty American, who buys manual transmission used cars, or the Havana teen, who starts his car by rolling it down the hill, both are familiar, of necessity, with what goes on \\"under the hood\\"...or else.    A person with claims to professional writing skills would of course be familiar with semantics as well as syntax. But in programming, semantics is confused with \\"being a compiler developer or something\\".    Unlike natural language semantics, which bleeds out in history and sociology, programming language semantics is coeval with the \\"way the compiler works\\" in the sense of its specification, captured NOT in Programming Languages for Dummies BUT INSTEAD in the specifications document for the language.    [In France titles in the For Dummies series are \\"pour les nuls\\", which is *tres amusant*. I don't mean to slam this series which is well written and useful, but its title needs rethinking, for it at once asserts class pride and solidarity while disempowering in the very act of doing so.]     Good program design is based on knowing how the compiler \\"works\\" in the sense of understanding the language contract, which in C forces while evaluation by reference but in Visual Basic forces it by value.    The advanced material in this book on the implementation of Prolog and logic languages is important because it shows how far these languages are frombeing complete in the sense of first-order logic with quantification, which explains the survival of procedural languages.    My First Computer Book, special-ordered from the Roosevelt University Bookstore in 1971, was Peter Wegner's Information Structures, Programming Languages, and Machine Organization, a book in the Algol tradition which taught how to think at the Edge City, where the user's problem meets the circuits. This book, like Wegner, teaches the same lessons. About its only flaw is that like many titles from Morgan Kaufmann, which seems to have an incestuous relationship with MIPS and the RISC kiddies, it overemphasizes clever optimization and completely downplays the importance of the stack model of computation, a RISCy tradition.	2005-02-27
US	50358924	R3648S6915UH9	0375708219	612091253	The Working Poor: Invisible in America	Books	4	9	30	N	N	The Weight of the World	This book, at somewhat of a more superficial level, reminds me of Pierre Bourdieu's 1990 narrative sociology of hard lives in France and Chicago, The Weight of the World.    What's most interesting about the pathologies narrated is that they are shared by the middle and upper middle classes in America, but become much more consequential when the money isn't there.     Of course, each pathology has to be narrated in its own unique context. Tolstoy started the Karenina famously by saying \\"All happy families are happy alike, all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way\\".    Both sides of this dictum, which was at best a snappy way of starting a good book, can be interrogated. Part of the Weight of the World on people (such as my fellow students at Roosevelt University in Chicago) who start with silent disadvantages is that they learn not to narrate their lives with any justice.    This is because to do so in a dysfunctional family is often to get whacked.    In drug and alcohol rehab, which we see in Shipler is where welfare to work must often start, language STARTS with the absolute requirement for a true recognition of what Marx described as one's relations to one's fellow man in his purple passage \\"all that is solid melts into air\\".     But then, in computer classes and classes in resume writing, the Clintonian compromise with an uncompromising Republican class war changes this, and suddenly, the narrative becomes highly structured.    As Shipler points out, it becomes a narrative entirely concerned with satisfying naturalized employer needs.    Shipler gives a telling example. Physicians, who spot serious childhood illnesses, almost never think to call the mother's supervisor at work to ask that accomodations be made because excessively privatized health care makes the physician \\"think like a manager and not a physician\\"...in a society in which members of professional guilds outside the legal profession (and to an extent within it) are increasingly encouragedto subordinate their professional judgement to \\"thinking like a manager\\"...a rather unpleasant sort of chap, at the limit: rather something out of Dickens, forever making nasty little calculations.    Thus \\"thinking like a manager\\" means the physician will have internalized a mental \\"block\\" in which the job arrangements of a poor mother are assumed to be absolutes, and unquestionable. The block of course has a very good reason, and this is the resurgence of the legal doctrine of employment at will, which since the 1980s has been used pretty much without mercy on lower-level employees.    Shipler is a thoughtful supporter of the Great Bubba and his Missouri Compromise with forces that since Reagan are as Uncompromising as the slave-owner South (and whose avatars are generally silent about their spiritual and at times physical inheritances from antebellum arrangements).    The problem for Shipler is that untangling arrangements at once partly benign, partly pathological, and in all cases intertwined is difficult social re-engineering in a society where the Uncomprising forces have greatly benefited from them.    Furthermore, nobody can call a work ethic, the willingness to get up and go, and wage labor an agreement with death and a covenant with hell, as did Garrison refer to the slaveowner's Constitution. Quite the opposite: progressive forces in Abolition times thought precisely as do modern Republican apologists.    They believed in the American dream of salvation through wage labor and saving money, as does Shipler: as does Bill Clinton. But where anti-slavery's simplicity of opposition meant that it escaped being an ideology, support for the eternal verities of work and save is not support for anything simple.    I mean, there is in my experience work like a dog, and blue one's hard earned dollars like a sailor in port: just because you work you don't have to save (although it's impossible to save if you don't work, unless you steal). Many of Shipler's poor remain poor because of odious lending arrangements in a society which has forgot the evils of usury. Others remain poor because they, like Sir John Falstaff, don't think sack and sugar a fault.    But nearly all remain poor because of a Gestalt, in which Shylock, sack and sugar combine. Their personal biographies (as Bourdieu also relates) are saturated with post-modern complexities and puzzlements.    Bourdieu's elder French men and women made decent lives for themselves in France of the 1950s. They joined the Communist party *sans peur*...which then taught them an interesting, but terribly real work ethic: since they were workers, enmeshed in a doomed system, it was their dignity, in nearly all cases, to show up on time, *en masse*, and work hard if only to frighten the bosses with a show of strength.    But as happened in the USA, where Vietnam and the 1960s intervened in the same way in France, where Algeria, Vietnam and the French experience of the 1960s intervened, resistance, for the children and grandchildren became what Eric Hobsbawm called \\"the anarchism of the lower middle class\\", a disempowering brew of passive aggression, drug and alcohol abuse, and cynicism.    The result today is that the lower middle, working and lumpen classes can't speak of their own dignity without being immediately suspected, in rehab, computer classes, and resume-writing classes, of a Bad Attitude and a desire to return to the Dreamtime of the 1960s.    The Hobbesianism, this war of all against all, pervades American, and American-influenced, society from top to bottom, and as a result, it's become a strange society of monads who counsel each other to Look Out for Number One.    In this explicit Hobbesianism, we're all Number One, but the trouble is paradoxically that which Orwell saw in Communism. Some of us, like Donald Trump, are more Number One than others and (in a regression to theological barbarism) one gains indulgences in the resulting foofaraw by serving more successful men.    Thus the business book advises a paradoxical, almost Buddhist path, to personal empowerment: the celebration of a successful self who in reality is another, more polished version of one's sweating self.     From top to bottom in American society, this has created mass delusion and the preconditions for reproduction of the same pathologies Shipler describes: anomie, isolation, aliteracy, cynicism and despair.    Capitalist \\"shock therapy\\" cured the Communist forms of these pathologies in those countries like Poland and the Czech Republic (for Communism as ideology naturalizes nonsense just as fast, if not faster, than capitalism as ideology). But no exogenous shock seems to be in prospect for capitalism unless Space Monsters from the Planet Zork arrive.     Capitalism, interpreted as the ideological exclusion of solidarity and in signal cases elementary acts of kindness, may be at this point an addiction in the West. In the epistemological crisis described by David Caute (in Critical Psychiatry) characteristic of the lower middle class family, we may need to marketize relations in preference to actually judging ourselves and others: to keep the world at arm's length.    Hopefully, this process has an end point.    While in France, I saw a French review of this book which in French shed new light on what's hidden in America: for the French writer spoke of \\"single mothers\\" as \\"meres celibataires\\".    To so speak of single mothers illuminates their flat situation with sudden light and shadow, for the Latinate language images them as an order of nuns, \\"chanting cold hymns to the moon\\".    It implies that single motherhood is less, as is described by the grim Puritan divine, a product of \\"choices\\" in an America in which we're always making choices later used against us, than a guild or a calling, in a Middle Ages unexperienced in America...where the single mother takes upon herself the inability of the patriarch to change a nappy or send a child support check.    Butfor the same reason the physician doesn't pick up the phone and yell at the uncaring boss, single mothers chant cold hymns to the moon on the bus to Walmart at 3:00 AM, and somewhere else no dinner is ever thrown, with beer and lap dancing, for men who've paid their child support.    The situation is occult in Adorno's naturalized sense, for lucky and successful people in America have been as it were possessed by a daemon. This daemon (whose spelling I make antiquarian to avoid any confusion with theological fantasy) has instructed his adepts never, on pain of exclusion from bien-pensance, to emotionally overtip the help, in the sense of ever recognizing that over and above a paycheck, the working poor are doing us a favor.    We even train ourselves never to think we're doing anyone any favors by working, because in the hegemonic ideology (so there: take that) the equation has to come out to zero: the pay we get is what we deserve, and, it's best to megaconsume (whether in the short term Yuppie sense, or the longer term, whee let's buy more house than we can afford, sense) than to show solidarity with fellow workers or even demand psychic satisfaction.    Well, if even the Shortest American in the World, Robert Reich of Harvard could not even for one minute ask himself WHY Republicans can't compromise, don't compromise and don't have to compromise, why friend Reich and Bubba can't THEORIZE, then even Hilary's 2008 nomination won't work. We'll wake up as in Groundhog Day, to find that the election was stolen from Hilary despite exit polls showing a Hilary landslide.    As antiphilosophical Americans (insert appropriate reference to Tocqueville right here, as soon as I get around to actualy reading that prolix Frog), we don't think there is any such thing as Objective Spirit, and the Germans who used to discuss such nonsense over beer and sausage on Chicago's Lincoln Avenue are now silenced.    But what Objective Spirit MEANS is that we have no control whatsoever over a political Groundhog Day, in which cockroach exterminators drown what's left of any welfare state in the bathtub and in which our voices for peace and economic justice have no air: in which like spacemen we scream in silence.    It was at this point that the late Derrida, in Specters of Marx, had to go around the bend, and start speaking of ghosts. We know a slave when we see one, dodging the ice on the Ohio while we cheer him on in the old play.     But precisely as the static Weight of the World is in fact silently borne, we realize that this World Trade Center is all we have. Materially, like Hamlet in Act One, we tend sadly only to reproduction of intolerable lives. It takes an exogenous, ectomorphic event such as Dad cap a pie on the battlements to make us imagine negative, and positive possibility.    But absent this, we have Bill Murray in Groundhog day, punctured only by what old Tom Eliot heard in The Waste Land: murmurs of maternal lamentation, Erde-Kundry (whom none could call fair) sighing under the cumulative weight.    We'll wake up to find that the American electoral system, superstructure as to its base, in fact is fair in that it transmits not what we know, what we think we want, but our darkest and innermost Fear and Loathing, expressed in the very idea that when we've learned not to cut ourselves a break, we're damned if we'll cut dem welfare queens, dem bums, a break.    The code was tweaked for a Neil Bush win? What else is new? Shipler's working poor fight a rigged system, rigged today using high technology which has become a second nature, and in the next installment, the bien-pensants will learn once and for all that Bush v Gore was only the first shot. They can \\"vote\\" for the next multimillionaire Democrat until they are blue in the face, but in their heart they want what's delivered to their mortgaged door by the wretched of the earth.    The Weight of the World, Allen Ginsberg's \\"Trees! Clocks! Radios! Tons!\\" is known only to the structural engineer as frozen energy, frozen anger, and bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon. The Working Poor, of course, know that their situation is never absolute, like slavery: my Mom's loyal maid knew instinctively that they were both mistress and servant, and coequal servants to my Dad's absolute need for a quiet, upper middle class, home (as compared to the usual *menage* of screaming wife, hounded husband, and noisy kids).    I conclude (aintcha glad I wrap it up) that we are ALL working poor: like Bob Marley said, we bellyful (maybe) but we hungry. But this should be a call to arms and to the strong compassion of Marianne, or forgotten Molly. When the storm breaks, it will be a mighty storm.	2005-02-26
US	50358924	R133LK5X4IMPXW	1400050669	951260070	The Lies of George W. Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	5	69	84	N	N	Liars, damned liars, and Bush	We know the President lies. But what this book confirms is far deeper than that.    It is that Bush's ENTIRE RECORD consists of lies.    Consider the self-righteous indignation that greeted Clinton's lie concerning sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky...told in part to protect the office of the President and three women: Lewinsky, Hilary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton...all of whom would be damaged in their personal lives by the truth.    Clinton's record, however, is not a series of lies as is Bush's.    It is an old maxim, from Plato to Kant, that a lie is an offense against truth which damages trust. As a result of Bush's continuous lying, half the country has for its sanity to reside in a fantasy zone, as does the poster below, where his inability to use Google \\"proves\\" nothing at all.    Political views become lifestyle, more an expression of a demented personality's desire for attention than anything else.     Grammar and syntax break down, as in the case where Sen. McCain's questioning of Bush's attendance at a Bob Jones University (sic!) function becomes the accusation that MCCAIN is accusing Bush of anti-Catholicism.    The event's text is searched, in other words, for the most convenient charge by crudely rearranging words.    And, the language is damaged by even calling this \\"mastery\\".    Basing our political views on methodological individualism and not seeing how groups, including speechwriters and flaks, Manufacture Consent, Bush becomes in the language of old-fashioned mastery a perverted cynosure.    Let's see. The \\"losers\\" are men of honor like Sen. McCain and the theodicy searches their resume for \\"defects of character\\" in order to avoid the conclusion that yes indeed, there are \\"conspiracies\\", the biggest to be a takeover of all three branches of government by corporations.    \\"Mastery\\" becomes empirical and measured by the appearance of success and the approbation of fools.    But \\"mastery\\" in this context needs to be renarrated as enslavement. There are clear indications (the non-firing of Rumsfeld being one) that Bush is the willing slave of a cabal of evil men, like the Gimp in the box in the basement, in Pulp Fiction.    Needed at this juncture is not Yet Another catalog of Bush's iniquities, and frankly, Peter Singer's book The President of Good and Evil: Taking George Bush Seriously has more depth.    Instead we can usefully regard Bush as a creature of our times, and our dark desires.    For some time in America, real rats and fools have become rich and famous. Because of this, the language changes to accomodate, simultaneously, the Rat Victories and the vastly more predominate cases where Nice Guys Finish Last.    In the 1950s, Sammy Glick and Willy Loman could be narrated as ultimate Losers in the emptiness, whether of Sammy Glick's material success or Loman's failure.    The problem, as stated in the creaky and deductive philosophy of Spinoza, is clear. If we at all admire, esteem, look up to, or even suck up to a Bush clone, whether on the national stage or the office, we are asserting values that contradict our natural instinct to eat bread and salt and speak the truth.    Of course, Puritanism, with its emphasis on unredeemability for most of us smokers, perversely makes space for this admiration in which the unshriven manifest their lack of election by admiring Don Trump.    The problem here is that Bush, unlike Sen.McCain or Howard Dean, refreshing scoffers as they are, proclaims, literally, that he is saved. This is odd, because he seems to feel no need to manifest salvation by any form of charity.     The problem is that today, MOST Americans use each other and the world with a complete lack of common sense or compassion and are gradually descending, one and all, into a Moronic Inferno of psychic chaos. And, they vote.    Bush expresses that chaos in his very syntax and as such is the cynosure of the doomed.      UPDATE 2-2-2005    Thanks to the meta-reviewers for the perfect score. If the people who gave this review a *non placet* are Bush supporters then I am pitching a perfect game in a sense for I displease those who are pleased with lies, damned lies, and George Bush. Of course, to convince them to support my case would be better, and a home run, with the bases loaded, by contrast to the more austere and intellectual pleasures of the perfect game.    The lies continue. In yesterday' column, Paul Krugman shows how the set of arguments used to show that Social Security is \\"broken\\" are contradictory with respect to the collection of arguments used to show how it is that rubes, who take their money out of withholding and head for Vegas, will create a sky-high 6.5-7 percent return on equities during the same period of time...a rate of return seen only during the Internet bubble.    Of course, the attraction of such an argument is that in logic and in a sense, arguments with contradictory premises imply anything.    The lies are for many Americans a convenient total substitute for truth on which they feed for mere hope as does the California body builder on supplements alone. The whole shebang, the complete virtual reality, is headed for its next exogenous shock as a result.	2005-01-24

The old boys were real enough and if American Movie Channel oldies are creditable they really talked like that but one must remember that they have for the most part shuffled off their mortal coil. <br /> <br />McArthur does miss the fact that a \\"prestige\\" form of speech does one job rawther well, and that is simple communication to people all over the world. The BBC itself is the prime example. While treating an argot like Bow Bells Cockney with respect, one must also keep in mind that much of it, as McArthur knows, was developed by the lads in order to hide swag from the coppers as in the case of rhyming slang that then removes the last rhyme. <br /> <br />Fascism is the limit of identity politics, and, insistence on equal rights for all argots can create bloody nonsense such as the de-hyphenation of Serbo-Croatian. But, as McArthur points out, languages are combining and argots are disappearing, so our task may as well be their preservation. <br /> <br />Read thoroughly, but jumping around as one would read a reference book, in search of juicy bits, one is well-rewarded. I now know how to pronounce Australian, for example, like Crocodile Dundee: it is pronounced Strine. This is marvelous economy for a frequent word, reducing Terra Australius down to bite size. <br /> <br />I never knew that there is an AntarcticEnglish, used by the international community in \\"the land of ice and snow\\". It deserves a literature, therefore here is my first contribution: <br /> <br />A beaker was bareassed on ice <br />And said, this is not very nice <br />For the hairs in me ass <br />Shall delay me manfood repast <br /> <br />For I have learned that in Antarctica, a \\"beaker\\" is a scientist, after a character in Sesame Street. \\"Manfood\\" is in binary opposition to \\"dogfood\\" and expresses, perhaps, the mutual interdependence of man and sled dog in Polar climes, at least until recently. My \\"beaker\\" uses \\"me\\" instead of \\"my\\" in that Celtic mode characteristic, I believe, of Strines, who are over-represented in the South Pole. <br /> <br />I'm not sure about the Oxford Guide's derivation of American Ebonics \\"homeboy\\". It was said to have been derived from men in prison who would attempt to relate to new fish by claiming a common neighborhood. It may equally relate to practice when working people of color would form communities in Chicago and other Northern cities, and integrate \\"boys\\" newly come up North from their own home towns. <br /> <br />I was called homeboy by a New York bellhop who I overtipped in 1991 and there is an association of likable naivety which may or may not be taken advantage of depending on the good nature of the homeys already knowledgeable about a new environment. <br /> <br />To be chillin, with the homes, is to have established an ongoing pattern of mutual recognition and respect combined with a basic wariness which is the enemy of enthusiasm and naivety. It is an Austinian \\"speech act\\" since it performs the acknowledgement as well as describing a mental state. <br /> <br />But the new environment in which I be chillin need not be prison, and, far more American blacks have had, in place of prison, the honest experience of moving to a new city for work and chilling, in the new city, with the homes. <br /> <br />Indeed, one wonder why simple work experience is so seldom foregrounded in discussion of language. Instead, for white and European people, their recreations are emphasized while American blacks get to be mentioned in the same context as prison...when, last time I checked, there are a lot of white homeys in jail too. <br /> <br />But I certainly understand that language is a political minefield. Its author fails to connect his research with Foucault's account of language as systematic capillary power because for many English, Strine, and 'merican academics, France is a no-fly zone: complementary to its fashionability in literary criticism, where French theory is redundancy, its utility in APPLIED lingustics is neglected. <br /> <br />But in general I be chilling with this book, and my homey has done an excellent job.	2005-01-20

It is consistently astonishing to me that in an era of Amazon and Borders, policy-makers should be so willfully informed...as if to crack a generalist book would put them out of the \\"loop\\" created by briefing papers, fantasies masqerading as inside information. <br /> <br />I am certain thoughtful and reflective troops serving in Iraq would appreciate a copy of this book to fill the spaces of boredom between the epochs of terror. They'd read accounts of the British essentially roaring about the shop in the 1920s in signal futility, \\"nation-building\\" a monarchy that shortly thereafter fell apart. The place names are all familiar. <br /> <br />In the author's interpretive framework, Iraq is a Thatcherite dream world for in Iraq, there is no such thing as society, instead clans and clan loyalty...Thatcher's vaunted \\"families\\" which the State can suborn to do its dirty business. <br /> <br />In fact, the author gives evidence of regression, for many Iraqis are reviving old and previously out of date mediaeval clan loyalties for self-protection. <br /> <br />Out of this, the Americans think to create some sort of capitalist and Christian dream-world and instead have created a nightmare. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the damage done by both the British and the Americans is irreversible, since \\"rational\\" borders tracking ethnic lines would involve mass transfers of population.	2004-11-11

US	50358924	R1B4E387CHLTC	0060510293	460642996	On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, & 9/11: A Story of Loss & Renewal	Books	5	8	12	N	N	Excellent and honest	Bill O'Reilly, who is far more sleazy than Walter Winchell was at Winchell's worst, accused Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor, Fitzgerald, of failing to meet his obligations to his employee's families when 700 of Cantor Fitzgerald's about 1000 employees died in the World Trade Center. <br /> <br />This book clearly and honestly shows, however, that Cantor, Fitzgerald as a small to medium business was unable to pay deceased employees after September 15 2001 for the very good reason that the events including the temporary closure of the markets, and the loss of the employees, cut off the company's air supply. <br /> <br />Instead and in a matter that hasn't been sufficiently celebrated because the media (including O'Reilly and Connie Chung) specializes in the dissemination of false ideas, Howard and the remaining employees of his company worked terribly hard while grieving so as to pay out a far more generous amount in bonuses and other renumeration. They brought Cantor Fitzgerald back from a near-death experience. <br /> <br />O'Reilly's attack had a nasty undertone of anti-semitism because it was conducted from the \\"point of view\\" of the \\"ordinary working person\\" who labors under the apprehension that ALL companies large and small have unused funds laying about the office and that NO business manager might not sweat bullets to meet each and every payroll. <br /> <br />O'Reilly then took credit for \\"forcing\\" Lutnick to do what the latter had been planning to do all along, which was pay compensation based on 4Q 2001 profits which would not have been earned had the salaries been continued. <br /> <br />A company like Cantor Fitzgerald is not a moral agent except insofar as it stays within the letter and spirit of the law, which Cantor Fitzgerald of course has done. But a *mensch* like Howard is indeed a moral agent and as such did not deserve to be precipitated, as a focus for inchoate rage, into a media spotlight in such a manner that for thousands of people (including former NYC mayor Ed Koch) he was merely \\"that guy, what's his name, who cried on TV and screwed up\\". <br /> <br />Indeed, the situation was an almost mathematical model of how the  media destroys knowledge by instead marshaling false consciousness. Lutnick was a decent person, no more or less good than the average CEO. But O'Reilly nonetheless used the Fascism of marshaling anger against \\"the unmentionable odor of death\\" to boost his own ratings. <br /> <br />This week, a court decision has absolved Fox news from any responsibility to the truth in a case of two journalists fired from Fox based on their refusal to file a story according to Fox's rules. Here is another document in a growing case against this media empire which is also the mouthpiece for the Bush administration. <br /> <br />Lutnick made a mark of himself by crying on TV shortly after the September 11 tragedy and was subject, I believe, to a post-human campaign conducted by a bully and a thug. <br /> <br />This story needs to be kept alive today, since Dan Rather is under attack for his good-faith reportage of documents attesting to Bush's failure to meet his Guard obligations. Rather was misled by a forgery and there's a possibility that the forgery was provided through third parties by Karl Rove in order to discredit the Democrats, at least on this issue. <br /> <br />In other words, systematic \\"spinning\\", primarily from the Right, have created a post-human climate of mistrust in which a CEO cannot also be a *mensch*, faced with a tricky business situation in which the banks could have put him out of business had he in fact paid salaries after September 15th. <br /> <br />In fact, a basically good person would have accepted Lutnick's story because basically good people need to feel not quite so alone. There is nothing to profit from stories of people who betray their employees, or feed false documents to third parties, unless, of course, there's a pre-existing pattern. <br /> <br />At the end of the day, even the ordinary reader of the New York Times can say that O'Reilly and Rove are thugs and bums while Howard L is probably OK. <br /> <br />At the end of the day, even such an ordinary person can conclude that a society which is so consistently beguiled to believe instead the worst is a Fascist society with a capital F.	2004-09-24

The rumor is that the stories of failure to serve are true, but the documents passed to CBS in September were fakes created by Karl Rove deliberately as a double-cross, created strictly to discredit CBS and the opposition. <br /> <br />When this rumor emerged, it was as if a very large segment, as large as the Ross ice Shelf, broke off never to rejoin our structures of trust and belief. <br /> <br />The stunt is precisely the sort of games siblings play. Precisely the sort of nonsense that occured between my own children which I wearily tried to forestall after 14 hour shifts and long-distance: for a Sibling Society hates parents and punishes parents, from welfare mothers to divorced dads, for the crime of having sex. <br /> <br />In a Sibling Society, siblings recognize that they have been cast into Bly's Euclidian hell in which in a post-human fashion, their ability to use language has been destroyed (as a Kant would have predicted) by systematic use of language and (in the hate-filled sneering of talk radio) \\"reason\\" to lie and to cover up. <br /> <br />The previous poster calls the book an \\"over-generalization\\", a favorite phrase of my generation. Seemingly so neutral, responsible, and academic, the phrase in actual use is a post-human phrase because out ability to create \\"generalizations\\" is what makes us human.  <br /> <br />The horror is complete. Bush will be re-elected to the outrage and despair of the rest of the world, and, shortly after the election, a massive terrorist event will occur. The Bush administration (like any Elder Brother left in charge by alcoholic parents) will do nothing to stop the horror, which it will take a Steven King to recount, assuming there's anything left. <br /> <br />But Steven King doesn't really narrate the deepest structures which have led America to her tragic predicament, whereas Robert Bly does. <br /> <br />He knows why the \\"sixties\\" so quickly curdled, in a few short years, from genuine hope to Altamont and vicious cults. Western society has lost its soul.	2004-09-18

The past year or so, my commercial affairs have taken me to two dying embers of the British Empire, Suva in Fiji and Hong Kong, now a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. Welshs book is invaluable on Hong Kong. <br /> <br />Dying? Dead. Suva is today a province in fact if not in law of Australia and Frank Welsh's book makes it very clear that Hong Kong never was British. It's always been a Chinese city with a vast Chinese majority. <br /> <br />The British overlordship was curiously meaningless, and, if I read Welsh's book alright, it has serious lessons for any American still so foolish as to support Bush's idiotic attempt at reconquista in Iraq. <br /> <br />For in weak piping times of peace, there is, it seems, and at least in the UK and in America, dominated as they are, and rightfully so, by formidable females, no shortage of men who come upon a mad desire for military folly nel mezzo de camin, as a midlife crisis. <br /> <br />Precisely when the generation that had actually braved shot and shell at Waterloo was beginning to succumb to age and strong drink, ambitious and unscrupulous politicians, it is clear from Welsh, decided it was time, in Marx's sense, to resolve a few contradictions with gun-powder. <br /> <br />The Opium wars resulted even as today the Iraq wars have been the folly of choice. <br /> <br />Like the Iraq wars, the Opium wars had a curious two-phase structure. The first war was limited by what the impossible French would call considerations of humanity on both sides. British commanders set specific limited goals and the Chinese mandarins actually expressed, more than once, concern for the welfare of white colonies in Guangdong factories and in Macau. <br /> <br />In the 1840s, neither side in other words quite fit the demonizing caricature and one is reminded of the fact that Tariq Azis, now in American clink, is an Iraqi Christian (a damnably inconvenient fact well-concealed by the idiot American news media) who endeavored to limit the first war for nothing more, and nothing less, than considerations of humanity (for let us not speak falsely now the hour is much too late)even as Bush the elder (and a genuine coalition) could not stomach a drive on Baghdad. <br /> <br />Iraqi physicians and soldiers in April of 2003 protected Jessica Lynch until her rescue for nothing more, and nothing less, than considerations of humanity. <br /> <br />In the Guangdong region, British commanders demanded extra-territorality because the Mandarins would, they said, impose savage and un-Christian punishments on Britishers, and the British wanted to impose condign Christian punishments including the cat of nine tails, hanging, and abandonment at towns end to starve.  <br /> <br />The second war, and the subsequent Elgin mission, were thanks to Palmerston (the evil genius of the entire affair) less informed on the Chinese side by Mencius benign philosophy, or what the unspeakable French would call considerations, de lhumanite. And as a result, by the time of Elgins violation of China, beastliness erupted on both sides: the scent of blood was in the air as it is today in Najaf. <br /> <br />Britain received as its prize a humid gaggle of mountainous islands, and, as soon as it was known that money was to be made, millions of Chinese swarmed in, who in fact made Hong Kong the great city it is today. Hong Kong never really benefited Britain. Any more than Iraq, so far, has been a net benefit to the sharpers and criminals who lured America into hell has been anything more than bloody and expensive folly, did Hong Kong benefit Britain. For as Welsh notes, Britains trade with little Holland has always exceeded its trade with China.  <br /> <br />Indeed, I am reminded, reading of British trades misadventures in Hong Kong and in China, of the hapless Indian touts at Tsim Sha Shue, who attempt to interest one in a fine British tailored wool suit. This is usually in 100+ Fahrenheit when one is covered in sweat, where the very thought of worsted is the worst thing in the world. One says to the tout with a grin, nemestay, sahib, knowing that he is just trying to get by; but one wonders who signs on for fine British tailoring in the tropics other than mad dogs and Englishmen. <br /> <br />Welsh is most amusing on, and most unimpressed by, Thatcher who like a tropical storm visited Hong Kong and China in the 1980s, making silly noises about treating Hong Kong as Britain treated the Falklands while her generals and admirals had kittens. Britain had, of course, no real leverage. <br /> <br />Britain exhibited le perfide Anglais and nauseating hypocrisy. It extracted a series of promises from the Chinese leadership without being in the least able to enforce Chinas conformity to them. In the one area where Britain had leverage, the issuance of passports to Chinese inhabitants, Britain simply stonewalled: one cant have more wogs, especially hard-working wogs. <br /> <br />But China does keep more or less to her 1997 commitments in order perhaps to lure Taiwan into one country, two systems and Hong Kong flourishes as before with today, it seems, at least one Brooks Brothers outlet per capitaoffering wear appropriate to the noonday sun. For China, much depends on dinner and Hong Kong is a meal ticket.  <br /> <br />Alls well, that ends well, so far. But clearly the Opium wars and the grab of Hong Kong began Britains slow decline into the tragicomic opera of today. For it was shortly after the Arrow nonsense that Germany began to beat Britain at  commerce. <br /> <br />Perhaps Iraq is Americas paredon in the same way.  <br />	2004-08-15
US	50358924	R1EHVI3SLRKRFT	0393320367	224026761	The Return of Depression Economics	Books	5	3	11	N	N	Alan Greenspan for us: Herbert Hoover for &quot;them&quot;	A sign of a the first rate economist is wit and readability: a sign of the economic hack is the belief that his prose like his science must be dismal. Galbraith, Keynes and now Krugman are three droll, and first-rate, economic writers.  <br />  <br /> Run of the mill economic writing is all too often the groaning of economic prohibitions and saws which when groaned from on high by madmen in authority tend to create Panic on Wall Street. Thus Hoover's false idea, that the Depression was somehow caused by the excesses of jazz babies in the 1920s, caused Hoover to apply the standard mustard plasters of his time, higher taxes and higher interest rates, beneath which the wound went septic. <br />  <br /> But Krugman's thesis in this book (which was written after the Mexican crisis of 1995 and the Asian crisis of 1998 but before the September 11 recession) is that while Western and developed economies learned not to self-apply Depression era economic sticking plasters, they think it's a great idea for brown men down in the tropics: although Krugman is too polite to say so, contemporary Depression economics is racist economics. <br />  <br /> Racism is said to be about discrimination. However, one characteristic of racism is the sloppiness of its racial categories. Standard racism is based systematically on outdated genetics and science in which the racial mark is inherited basically on the say-so of the racist, whose confused mental categories control. <br />  <br /> Thus as Krugman shows, when Thailand went into a tailspin in 1998, an interesting crowd of morons with modems and money (who neocon economists flatter as having a collective wisdom that was not on display) decided that although many miles separate Korea from Thailand, both places are kinda woggy and while we're pulling out of Thailand we might as well pull out of Korea, just to be sure. <br />  <br /> No single attribute except perhaps a spicy native cuisine united the victims of the Asian meltdown, in whichmoney fled the Kimchi and embraced the bland, the known and the temperate zone. <br />  <br /> Australia in this perception is replaced by the symbol of Australia, which is a jolly white man; Thailand is replaced by the sinister, or feckless, Oriental, as if the reality has become an oversimplified computer icon. Crocodile Dundee vs. Ming the Merciless? It??s no contest of the representation has replaced the thing represented. <br />  <br /> This is racist economics because the neocon pronouncements, which in the late 1990s denied the madness of crowds, ascribed no collective wisdom to the 80% of Venezuelans who want &quot;government intervention&quot; but cannot vote with money they don't have. Money, that is, talks. <br />  <br /> As a result the Depression economics of Herbert Hoover including &quot;hard&quot; money and negative compassion are urged not at home but on the nonwhite areas of the world, as well as &quot;white&quot; areas tarred by racist transitive and associative laws; the transitive law of racial pollution, operating out of sight, infecting ??rational?? economic decisions, and economic guilt by association, sanctified by sanitizing phrases such as ??just business??. <br />  <br /> At the time Krugman wrote, Argentina had not been persuaded into the folly of hardening its currency by locking it into the dollar; Argentina went ahead and did so and today is fully part of the Third World as its reward.  <br />  <br /> Krugman recommends capital controls to those countries subject to racist capital flight. The two-edged aspect of any kind of autarky is that it can isolate the country from the disease as the unconvertability of the Yuan helped China escape crisis in 1998, but also isolate the country from the cure.  <br />  <br /> However, the leadership of China has learned how to balance autarky with free trade cleverly enough to avoid returning China to the closed system of the Cultural Revolution era with the result that the excitements of shoppingreplace the excitements of big character poster making. As a result the dragon is leading the tigers out of the wilderness. <br />  <br /> Krugman, almost alone among American economists, has a vision ??thing??, and a sense of humor. This is linked with a flexibility that admits that just as no economic gesture, such as free beer, is guaranteed results, the refusal of any one gesture, such as free beer, or something, is itself a gesture, which creates expectations, and thus unintended consequences. <br />  <br /> Hayek was right: people do make life plans based on expectations created by government policies, and socialism laid an egg because it did not realize that socialism is a text, that people take seriously, and that alters their planning. Today, neoclassical capitalismus is laying an egg, as Krugman describes, insofar as policymakers?? decision making is narrowed to a set of Politically Correct responses. Because it is narrowed, people plan responses which cancel the effect of the neoclassical policy??for the same reason people plan responses in socialism??s follies, from big character poster making to feeding the oversupplied free beer to the dog.  <br />  <br /> Krugman gives an excellent example. Countries in the developed world, can always deregulate their currencies during a downturn. This makes their exports more attractive worldwide, and this creates a revival of manufactures and economic activity in general. <br />  <br /> Korea and Thailand, on the other hand, find that they can??t devalue, especially by incremental and controlled amounts. This is because deregulation in the developing or merely perceived-as-woggish world is interpreted by millions of moneyed, modem??ed morons as a sign of governmental fecklessness and deeper problems, probably the result of giving free beer on the sly to the poor, or the dog. <br />  <br /> Far from making dispassionate judgements, speculators make ideological judgements that the governments in question aren??t toeing the mark. Most speculators (especially the losers, the statistical majority who move their lips when they read) are unlike Keynes economic conservatives who have internalized the texts about hard work and saving that make them alert to its possible absence, and a deregulation becomes, when engaged in by a country with spicy cuisine, a red flag. <br />  <br /> As a result, economies in the hot food countries have only Hoover-style ??depression?? economics. Terrorism may be the most tragic result. <br />	2004-07-22

Books	1	6	57	N	N	The misery of political &quot;science&quot;	The anomaly of China is that it is a &quot;successful&quot; Communist state: entrepreneurs in the Hong Kong region are applying to join the Communist party. However, this book isn't organized around that anomaly although such organization would give it much-needed structure.<br />The misery of political &quot;science&quot; is the way in which it assumes thet men are easily understood and led if only we could get them to understand that we are post-ideological and therefore led by the desire for wealth alone.<br />The history of the Cultural Revolution as an epistemological crisis, in which the ground, it seems, was cut from the feet of political actors who, removing the Confucian authority of others to speak, found it returned from them in turn, is unwritten (and just as complex as the preceding, and rather tortured, construction). It is unwritten because we no longer let Simone de Beauvoir and other public-intellectual gasbags have a go, and instead, narrow specialists look though lenses of which they seem to be unaware.<br />Saich would be hard put to explain the Tai'ping rebellion and very easy to explain Tsu Hsi, empress dowager. The very idea of some clown failing his examinations and deciding that he's Jesus' kid brother, in fact rather like some clowns overcoming a flight crew with box cutters, is the sort of exogenous-to-our-neat-system that gives political &quot;scientists&quot; fits: whereas for all of her deep dealing, the motivations of Tsu Hsi were clear, and her 21st century counterpart-in-miniature, the matriarch of many a modern Chinese family, is both alive and well, and catered-to by the new system of devil, take the hindmost.<br />But the self-reflexivity of political science, albeit systematically ignored by the political scientist means that the system manufactures the self-seeking and the shallow.<br />Saich regards narratives ungrounded by economic policy-making and self-interest as an amusing form of casuistry, as if he has preselected his audience from the knowing who no longer deal in &quot;grand narratives&iexcl;± because of the ease in which they can be continued to any pre-selected conclusion.<br />For example, he quotes and dismisses a Party member&iexcl;¯s comment that the state-sponsored programme for micro-lending small capital amounts to China&iexcl;¯s rural poor need not be financially &iexcl;°sustainable&iexcl;± in Professor Saich&iexcl;¯s terms. The Party member argued that the programme would eliminate poverty and therefore not need to be sustainable.<br />The Party member may of course have been wrong. Grameen Bank microlending to poor women who pay their debts on time may not be a magic bullet.<br />The problem is that Saich delivers the anecdote without any argument to the effect it is wrong, as an objectified species of old-style Marxist B.S.<br />Another problem is that Grameen style lending has had to struggle, against the fungibility of the financial system itself, to preserve its communitarian ethos against a global financial system which could literally care less about poor women&iexcl;¯s lives, and is all too ready to &iexcl;°tranche&iexcl;± the loans in such a way that the debtor never knows who she will deal with from month to month.<br />In the passage on micro-lending, Professor Saich just assumes without explanation that there are threshholds of risk and return which are &iexcl;°sustainable&iexcl;±: but the whole point of the Grameen discovery was that the threshholds are themselves a product of narration. The Grameen narrative created the numbers.<br />The only way to protect the interests of the poor in a globalized system is in fact deep narrative because the poor have only a story to tell. It might not be elegant: it might be only &iexcl;°I will gladly pay you Thursday for a hamburger today&iexcl;±. But it&iexcl;¯s all they have.<br />However, Saich dismisses narrative as kin, on the one hand, to Marxist stem-winders, and on the other to the sort of bunkum that corrupt officials come up to justify their excess perks.<br />This world-view itself isn&iexcl;¯t sustainable because it gets blind-sided by &iexcl;°terrorism&iexcl;±.<br />The lack of any coherent world-view that dares speak its name makes this book hard going, because it generates incoherence on every page. For example, on the same page Saich praises, in Politically Correct terms, the successes of microlending, he calls microlending unsustainable as if we have to make pious noises in its direction to keep Hilary happy, but then return to the counting-house by the wharves, and return to squeezing every last drop out of the debtor class.<br />He does so because he believes that civil society institutions should operate micro-lending; but at this stage, this is a non-starter in China and he knows this.<br />Saich cannot, it seems, properly narrate China&iexcl;¯s foreign policy without returning to economic themes. He doesn&iexcl;¯t have the historical imagination to get in the shoes, of the jokers in the Forbidden City, and ask why their concept of China does include Xingjiang and Tibet but not Mongolia, let us say, or chunks of Vietnam.<br />China presents to the thoughtful a fascinating ethnic topos, in which the Han could reconcile themselves in 1644 to Manchu takeover but could never have done so had the Russians under Peter the Great gotten themselves a bit more organized, and invaded China in the same era.<br />As an American expat, I inform myself of these matters for the same reason British officers engaged obscure, and rather dotty, Cantabrigian specialists in Persian poetry and Sumerian pottery as they and their train stumbled about central Asia, and, for that matter, about China; apart from curiosity there is also an instinct, for self-preservation. As Edward Said has pointed out, the replacement of the humanities and the &iexcl;°classics&iexcl;± as lenses for understanding, while in some areas an improvement, creates a new set of high-tech, night vision blinders that are worse than useless when they are broken.<br />It is disturbing, in other words, to be told that free markets bring &iexcl;°freedom&iexcl;± in their train, only to have the ATV and Pearl news of the July 1 mass march in Hong Kong almost completely blacked out.	2004-07-03
US	50358924	R13DCY6WXSGZC6	0029109809	323215145	Short History Of Chinese Philosophy	Books	5	10	21	N	N	A real eye-opener	This book should put to rest, once and for all, the very idea that Chinese philosophy is a set of disconnected and rather charming aphorisms, primarily concerned with ethical matters and not ontology, and productive of quietism in politics.<br />In Western bookstores, Asian philosophy in general is filed separately, and often ranged alongside the Tarot, crystals and the New Age.<br />But as Professor Fung Yu-Lan makes clear, the concerns of Chinese philosopher were with truth.<br />It is true that there has been a tradition of edification in Chinese philosophy. However, this edification has been consistently treated as the end product of, and motivation for, the philosophical journey, and truth is assumed to be edification's necessary precondition.<br />Even the most &quot;geometric&quot; of Western philosophers in the modern era such as Spinoza recommended their philosophy for the global improvement and final edification of the mind, and, as Professor Fung Yu-Lan points out, Spinoza's final words in documents such as Of Human Freedom have an exaltation they share with &quot;the Tao that can be named is not the eternal Tao&quot;.<br />Had Professor Fung's book been written at a somewhat later date, it would also have mentioned the Tractatus of Wittgenstein, whose negative exaltation, in passages such as &quot;Wie auch beim Todt&quot; (&quot;so too at death the world does not alter but comes to an end&quot;) have an &quot;Oriental&quot; edification that is based, in the &quot;Oriental&quot; precision and economy of what has gone before.<br />Post Edward Said, of course, &quot;oriental&quot; requires scare quotes. But a reading of Chinese and Islamic philosophy shows today how &quot;Oriental&quot; with scare quotes makes contemporary &quot;analytic&quot; Western philosophy, insofar as it is anti-edification not in Wittgenstein but in Ayer and in Quine, is the world-philosophical exception...whose deliberate cultivation of ugliness has a political explanation and is linked to the West's rage for an undeserved, and perhaps short-lived, hegemony.<br />We find in Professor Fung Yu Lan's book and original texts that far from universally recommending quietism and obedience in the political sphere, anti-Hobbes, Mencius felt that the sovereign was bound by the Tao.<br />Mencius talked back to great kings when they demanded information from which they could profit with in fact an analytic than anticipated Hobbes, and Spinoza, by thousands of years, for he showed the king how &quot;profit&quot; was a zero-sum game that (perhaps especially in agrarian societies, but not exclusively) would set the king against the knights or *shih* and the *shih* against the common people.<br />Mencius had only the inexhaustible Tao for the king. This had a practical result in that for thousands of years, ordinary slobs in China had on balance a squarer deal than the slaves and serfs of the West.<br />Indeed we find that Chinese political philosophy emphasized obedience dialectically for the surprising, even shocking, reason that two great dynasties were formed by peasant jacqueries as if Wat Tyler had overthrown Richard Plantagenet and as if, today, the Tyler menage were installed at Buckingham Palace amidst great pomp and state.<br />As if Spartacus had not in other words been crucified in vain.<br />Thus obedience becomes an active virtue rather than the nasty secret it is even today in the West, where a surface cultural rebelliousness is in fact used to enforce deep conformity as seen in Foucault.<br />At the heights, we see from this short book (which unfortunately only whets the appetite for the unabridged history  by this scholar, available at Symond's off the Salisbury Road in Hong Kong, but expensive as well as expansive) that Chinese first philosophy existed in the form of what can only be termed, an ontology in order to disambiguate it from either theology or metaphysics.<br />For at the beginning and unlike Heraclitus, Lao T'se separated li andyi, and &quot;the Tao that can be expressed is not the eternal Tao&quot; is not merely edifying.<br />Ontologically it is the same sort of analysis of concepts that is much more painfully expressed (thousands of years later) in the Kritik der Reinen Vernunft.<br />The insight is profound. For if ontology were crude theology or metaphysics and ultimately some shopkeepers inventory of the ultimate furnishings of the world, then those knick-knacks would themselves have a Tao or li, residing in Kantian form, which would not be expressed in the ontological assay, leading to infinite regress.<br />But as Professor Fung points out, in a way that also anticipates Adorno, this negative result is supreme wisdom. And as he correctly shows (but does not say out of courtesy, leaving the job to an insensitive clod like me), the sour, late-Wittgenstein gesture, of decrying philosophical talk as the buzzing of the fly in the fly-bottle, is also a mistake.<br />&quot;The Tao that can be expressed is not the eternal Tao&quot; is after all misused by New Age gnomes in corporations to silence dissent, and a populist, survey-course misunderstanding of Kant is that he denied the knowability of &quot;truth&quot;: but clearly and as this book declares, &quot;one must speak very much before one is silent&quot;.<br />Nothing further from a Western re-presentation of Oriental philosophy could be imagined, for in the Orientalist mis-re-presentation, the adept is forever the Parzival fool/seeker beaten into silence by the Zen master in a totalitarian caricature.<br />Western thought is wounded by a series of splits that emerge, perhaps, from Trinitarian doctrines and the fact that Western historical memory includes a time before writing in a way the Chinese does not. The result, for example, is the monstrous, if unremarked, fact that what Western people study in school is forgotten on spring break and seldom applied on the job.<br />The result is a Romanticism at the end of its tether which normalizes deviance, in which &quot;edification&quot; is a term without content.<br />Without forgetting its love affair with truth, Chinese philosophy is a healing return to the very idea that after great pain, a feeling for aphorisms comes...a clumsy paraphrase, perhaps, of Lady Dickinson, but, I think, apposite.	2004-06-23

Growing up near her in Rolling Meadows, little Hilary in nearby Park Ridge seems to me to have been a typical idealistic Chicago suburban teen of the early 1960s, many of whom were attracted to Barry Goldwater's relative honesty, tonic against the background of the growing moronization of TV politics...managing to ignore the simple fact that Barry Goldwater was a lunatic who would have gotten us blown to Kingdom Come.<br />Her harsh judgement, in print, of her grandmother, indicates to me that Hilary remains middle class and as such, despite her good intentions, cannot speak for the growing poor of this country.<br />Britain's Labour party and the Democrats in the USA have both been taken over by the middle class in part because the war on labor unions in both countries mean that working people are too busy working to be active in their own interests, or even form a coherent idea of what is going on.<br />The book had me thinking well of Hilary: but then, she, the Bubba and Chelsea attended an unveiling of the Bubba's portrait at the White House. In view of what Bush has done to this country, had I been the Bubba I would not have shown up.<br />The United States won't rethink its committment to inequality. In the 1960s there was already a sharp racial and class divide at the Des Plaines river. This divide has moved to the west and is now at Salt Creek in Palatine but it is real. Another divide exists between the regentrified core and the ring of immigrant, minority and (former) working class neighborhoods.<br />Hilary shows there is an unavoidable tendency for upper class feminists to blame the victim and fall prey both to blame-the-victim religion and \\"personal responsibility\\".<br />The book is entertaining. I would like to know what jokes Bill tells to make her laugh after all these years.<br />The problem is that we need not find political figures entertaining. Abraham Lincoln reserved the off colorstories and anecdotes for a small circle of friends when the jug was passed. He had enough respect for the people to be a serious man when he spoke to the people.<br />We have in other words been entertained to the point where working class males literally have no representation whatsoever and instead form rich fantasy lives of identification with the very males who are screwing them. Hilary, Barbara Boxer and other demonized ladies have done in fact more for these bozos than Rush Limbaugh including the recognition that, with respect to child support, it is true that you can't get blood from a rock.<br />But with their lack of relative passion and simple outrage against what's been done to this country by Reagan and Bush, these ladies seem to many to be irrevelant Ladies Bountiful worth at best a pound from the poor box and a prayer meeting that does not pay the back child support.<br />Meanwhile, men like Mario Cuomo, who gave an impassioned but unremarked speech at the 1984 Democratic convention against the simple dishonesty of creating a deficit in order to destroy the safety net (a crime which the current administration has repeated), don't get the book advances, it appears...and are subject to a racist, anti-Italian, and anti-Catholic whispering campaign that has predisqualified them from high office in a manner reminiscent of Know-Nothingism and the Ku Klux Klan.<br />Of course, for Cuomo's kid and countless other liberals who dare not speak their name, the Democratic party is now the ship, and all else is the sea, as the Republican party used to be for W. E. B. Dubois; they share his despair at a winner-take-all, devil take the hindmost, wealth-dominated, gerrymandered and oligarchic Republic which was created by ambitious Yankee sharpers in 1776 and has persisted without needed reform since then.<br />Their despair is transmuted into anger against spoilers like the gloomy Ralph of Nader: but his inability to get elected is not only the result of his defective character, it's also an artifact of the system.<br />Hilary is part, whether she likes it or not, of a dysfunctional American family in the same way the goodwife of a drunk may be said, by her sweet reason alone, to enable his behavior. Living History makes this clear.<br />At the end of the 1960s, caught between the Weathermen on one side, with their foolish rampage in my Chicago, and ambitious, \\"progressive\\" Hilary/Bill RFK and McGovern supporters on the other, already learning, as their elders had learned, to compromise themselves and be enablers, I despaired of the possibility of \\"change\\".<br />The genius of the American system, if we may call it that, is that for 200+ years it hasn't sucked, just enough, to make us want to change it. We've \\"enabled\\" it. <br />However, Bush may change the rules of this poker game, simply by insisting on the rights of the planter class to such an extent that enabling old Massah in the Hilary mode becomes unsustainable.	2004-06-15
US	50358924	R1I4CX5UA1WX4Z	0393321878	415256012	Speaking of Chinese: A Cultural History of the Chinese Language	Books	5	10	19	N	N	Excellent introduction to the language	I write as a newbie to China and its ancient language, who used this book as orientation and as a break from the rote work that learning Chinese demands.<br />The book is a well-written overview of the written and spoken languages which provides a &quot;top-down&quot; overview of the terrain that language learning neglects for drill in basic conversation. In particular, &quot;business&quot; Chinese can be easily a form of Klingon, an oversimplified language informed only by current concerns, which may create the very misunderstandings it pretends to avoid.<br />But as a Western educator I disagree with an implication in the chapter &quot;Old Wisdom, New Technology&quot;, and this is that because &quot;technology&quot; is &quot;Western&quot;, Chinese students are better off learning Pinyin and computers than writing the characters...or, perhaps, that we must accept this naturalized development.<br />The continued survival of the abacus and the fact that it's faster than electronic calculators in the hands of a skilled operator should teach us not to reify Western Technology, that is, to treat it as a natural force like global warming to which we must necessarily, perhaps with a sigh of ai-ya, demur.<br />Understood as an extension of culture, the Chinese up to about 1750 had MORE technology in the sense of practical solutions to problems of daily life than did Europeans.<br />The &quot;complexity&quot; of Chinese characters is not an absolute. It is relative to the origins of the Western encoding of &quot;all&quot; characters in 256 bits, the &quot;ASCII&quot; code, which in the early 1960s simply ignored the fact that most people use a richer &quot;character set&quot;.<br />Complementary to the complexity of Chinese characters is the fact that their mastery imparts information handling skills at an early age and results in the self-discipline which has made Chinese software developers, for years, highly successful at creating &quot;Western&quot; solutions.<br />In general any claim that a system of writing is &quot;too complex&quot; needs to be classified with Plato's original charge against writing, that it was marginal and unnecessary to the conduct of affairs, and, as Derrida has shown, this charge is bad faith since it can only be made in writing, in traditional Chinese terms, by a vermilion decree swaying all under heaven.	2004-06-01
US	50358924	R5PI5JFZPV5RJ	0525948139	537228107	The President of Good and Evil: The Ethics of George W. Bush	Books	5	15	21	N	N	Moral Seriousness Replaces Irony	Reading philosophy requires that one master a form of \\"suspense\\"; the suspense of judgement. <br />The ersatz for this suspense is ignorance masquerading as irony. Since the American educational system fails its main mission, American college students often learn an ersatz for cultivation: not even attempting a moral or intellectual judgement. From their irony, which often generates Fundamentalist enthusiasm as its reverse without pausing to visit nuance and depth on the way, the Bush spinmeisters have manufactured a near-majority.<br />Reading Singer, on the other hand, requires that one follow long chains of reasoning, in situations where, at times, Singer hasn't committed himself to a view. Then, one is required to commit oneself without irony and with moral seriousness to a view.<br />Singer is able to use the evidence to show that even if the President is well-intentioned he fails to achieve his goals. No Child Left Behind becomes quite a lot of children left behind, and, of course, the crusade in Iraq has resulted in a replication of the conditions of Saddam's jails. <br />Singer concludes that Bush stopped developing morally at the stage where a moral system consists in a set of commands. <br />It's possible that like many men, Bush fears the chaos implicit in the very idea that morality can't be reduced to copybook maxims. The conclusion often drawn from this is nihilism. <br />Of course, as regards Iraq, Bush (and Tony Blair) needed only to listen past their circle of advisers. The large minority in the USA of ordinary people and a majority of the people world wide advised Bush and Blair that the war was wrong. <br />Bush's morality is ultimately a narrative and the truth and falsity of his acts can only be understood in a literary fashion. Singer?s chains of reasoning are at best useful in allowing the passionate to marshal their arguments.<br />Only a novelist would link Bush's ability to laugh at a death row inmate when governor of Texas, and the cultureof bullying and sexual violence (against women, gays and low-dominance males) which both Bush administrations managed to create, and what's happened at Abu Ghraib, but the link is real. <br />Singer, in a reasoned minimal judgement of Bush, engages in no phillipics and no rhetoric about the \\"evilduuers\\" Bush and Co. Singer rather charitably concludes that Bush has failed to grow up. <br />But only a novelistic apprehension of Bush's life would understand that there is a link between his sexual and drug misadventures of the 1970s (a time in which he appears to have used his position as the Fortunate Son to sexually humiliate others), his mockery of reformed Death Row inmates, and what happened, on what was his watch, at Abu Ghraib. <br />The actual guards at Abu Ghraib got the message. It's O.K. to violate other people at a deep level. It's even fun. And, since we're \\"good\\" old boys, what we do can always be justified. <br />This obscenity needs to be confronted quietly and remorselessly and this is what Peter Singer has done. <br />In an essay, \\"Fascism as the Nightmare of Childhood\\", midcentury \\"critical theorist\\" Adorno asks what it would be like if the terrors of the sensitive, *haute* bourgeois child came to <BR>pass in adulthood. <br />Adorno describes a nightmare world in which the adults become children, that is arrested in their moral development, and repair to the beer hall of mittelEurope with Fortunate Sons, students identified as comers, to plot the degringolade of cultivation, moral seriousness, and privacy itself. Adorno narrates this as necessarily a regression, and a withheld promise of enlightenment. <br />In a similar passage written in the same epoch, Eric Maria Remarque asks what happened to the fathers of the generation that sent the men to the trenches of WWI, what had happened to the world of enlightenment and progress. <br />It might be said that it's over the top (to continue the trench warfare of metaphor) to compare the slaughter of The Somme to failing to give prisoners clothes, or forcing them to jerk off. <BR>The problem with this objection is twofold. The first problem is that apart from the Nazis and the Japanese, the combatants of both wars did not use sexual humiliation of detainees for the very good reason that it made no military, or military intelligence, sense. The second problem is that evil seems to be additive. <br />That is, finding new and innovative ways to degrade the human person, even if nonlethal, place the perpetrators, whether they will it or not, in the same league tables as the Nazis. <br />They are compared to Nazis, whether they will it or not. Extant Nazis applaud them and throw flowers. And, future historians, viewing things in a manner closer to sub specie aeternitatis, put them in the same class, in a chapter headed \\"man's inhumanity, to man, from 1900 to 2100 A.D.\\" <br />This is indeed the world-historical sniff test, a literary sniff test, but one curiously precise. It's a test that seems to come from a deep place, the place beyond passion where Singer resides. <br />Adorno, of course, did not narrate this reversion as mere amnesia. As a dialectician he knew that the reversion would contain Enlightenment in such a way as to both make it more terrifying, and to make the traditional tools ineffectual. <br />Therefore to say that Singer is merely using the quiet voice of \\"reason\\" to counter a genuine moral decline is off key, in part because neoconservatism has a knack for making one ashamed of \\"reason\\" when \\"reason\\" is clearly a club. <br />In fact, and as Singer's work demonstrates, the Bush administration is a call to creation, not \\"reason\\". From its violation of international law, we need to create enforceable international laws such that when US army officers, of flag rank, get off the plane at SFO, they aren't spit upon, but are met instead by US Marshals, deputized by The Hague to detain them for clear violations of the rights of man and citizen.	2004-05-23
US	50358924	R2Z1292FSAGPGB	074322504X	879198279	Softwar: An Intimate Portrait of Larry Ellison and Oracle	Books	3	9	36	N	N	Master of the poison, master of the cure	In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was an open secret that if you were what was called then \\"one of the freaks\\" and you had, perhaps, taken a few physics or math classes involving computer usage, you could get work for any number of banks, insurance agencies and other mainframe users. The boss was grateful for your work, and, you could pretty much control the conditions.<br />It appears that Larry Ellison was one of these early programmers, whose maturation is documented in this book. But as with any maturation, it includes the acquisition of blind spots.<br />For while I in general support Larry's goal of eliminating \\"islands\\" within organizations of isolated and contradictory data and code, I am more pessimistic than he as to whether it can be accomplished.<br />The well-known and by now well-worn theme of Derrida, that of the undecidable gap between writing and speech, means that the ultimate grand vision, of \\"one\\" data base, may never be attained.<br />Larry is right about the Internet: it is the Last Big Thing. This can be proven apriori. For given two or more networks, and given zero cost and high benefit in their connection, whether through a narrow gateway or broadband, then we can say that the two networks \\"want\\" to become one network and instantaneously, at warp speed, shall do so. In the late 1980s, several networks operated in academia, government and privately did just this because there is, absent security considerations, a seemingly irresistable craving on the part of networks to join other networks and indeed to become the Internet.<br />This is the synthetic apriori argument, for both the existence and unity of the Internet as a given. However, and as soon as it is constructed, the reverse, analytic argument against the Internet's usability by the corporation may be constructed, which will return us to Mr. Ellison: for I fail to see how the possibility, of constructing a single logical path to a single data base for the organization, means it canbe actualized.<br />I fail to see this because this has long been an unmet promise of ultimate managerial control within organizations (the \\"executive dashboard\\" being one such foolish idea), a control which manages to dismiss the fact that an organization consists of the labor of intelligent beings all the way down...to the person who picks up the trash.<br />I fail to see this because as a form inescapably of writing, data systems imply their own multiplicity. The \\"scribe\\" in all societies develops his own agenda and there is no check on him available to power as such, because power as such relies on the self-interested \\"scribe\\" to transmit its will and an almost (but not quite) mathematical problem results in the self-reflexivity.<br />The crisis is in Mr. Ellison's genuine concern with the way in which data and human intelligence systems failed to predict September 11, a concern which I happen to share. Indeed, I believe that September 11 starkly fulfilled a dismal prophecy of the late hero computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra.<br />Unlike many highly-placed figures in the computer science establishment, hero computer scientist Dijkstra was concerned, all the way down, about the quality and even the basic correctness of the data systems being designed over his lifetime, and he said at one point that he feared that organizations would collapse under the cumulative overcomplexity of their unmastered data systems. The stark images of a collapsing center for symbol processing on September 11 may be the fulfillment of this prophecy.<br />One of the FBI field agents assigned to investigation of terrorism prior to September 11, Colleen Rowley, testified before Congress that she did not even have the capability to enter Boolean format queries in the FBI data base, for example of the form \\"terrorist association and attends flight school\\".<br />Of course, Oracle data bases of the sort Larry and his company provide, provide this capability in mass quantities. At the same time, their very complexity (which may be unavoidable) generates scribal bureaucracies which are in both Plato's and Derrida's sense pharmakon, poison and cure, and, in general, the hair of the dog.<br />It is clear that these sorts of scribal bureaucracies at the FBI felt that some sort of extension or hack to provide rapidly the needed capability at the FBI was a \\"hard\\" problem, because these scribal bureaucracies reproduce themselves by insisting that such problems are \\"hard\\", and that the CEO is too busy to involve himself with writing...in a stark, if completely unconscious, replication of Plato's account of writing.<br />The result today is that a great deal of social inequality, created in part by fortune-seeking by the scribal class, means that it's impossible to create a unified written \\"intelligence\\" for policy making, and the result is an out of control foreign policy which as I write is creating preconditions for further terrorism.<br />Symonds breathlessly notes that Larry and his wife are both big fans of Donald Rumsfeld. Bush, and Bush's war, have deep roots in the self-interest of the new, successful American elite.<br />This elite marched and protested its parent's war in Vietnam, and, Ellison was a supporter of Robert Kennedy's fatal bid for the 1968 presidential nomination. Rumsfeld, for that matter, was an anti-war Republican under Nixon.<br />However, it appears that Larry may be blind to realities in much the same way that middle-aged managers were blind to the downside of enormous mainframe computing in the early 1970s. He views the future as one of large corporations competing, especially in his own industry, for a diminishing pie. <br />However, large corporations are composed of intelligent agents, who act from a unique combination of self-interest and complete irrationality, and, just as Ellison's own generation constructed its own reality in the form of microcomputer and micro culture, the next generation may prove him wrong. Or, Dijsktra'sprophecy may come true, in which case we'll be busy gathering firewood and not worrying about SQL.	2004-04-10
US	50358924	R12YMAA9D4DZY7	070116834X	894478786	World History: A New Perspective	Books	5	11	15	N	N	One with Nineveh and Tyre	This is a unique \\"world history\\", comparable to Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States, and Norman Davies' The Isles (a non anglo-saxon-centric history of Britain). It abandons Eurocentrism and Orientalism while risking but ultimately avoiding Sinocentrism.<br />Ponting's earth is most assuredly round and it is centered on Eurasia and China, and his focus on China is merely mathematical. Beijing was until the 18th century the largest city in the world and for centuries Western freebooters wanted what China produced, but when Western traders presented themselves and their wares to the Chinese in the 16th century the Chinese probably said what the fairy, Puck, says in the old play, \\"what hempen homespuns have we here?\\".<br />The Chinese rejected Western production as inferior until the 19th century and even in the 1840s the only \\"production\\" they \\"accepted\\" was opium.<br />Indeed, Shakespeare's Orient was, as Ponting ceaselessly reminds us, a place where Western freebooters and adventurers were trying to get to precisely because it was more developed and had more Cool Stuff.<br />Ponting also shows how the Islamic and Chinese worlds were essentially deindustrialized at gunpoint during the 18th and 19th centuries because in an historical aberration the \\"east\\" was at a temporary disadvantage.<br />China's very success during the Manchu dynasty produced pressure on arable land in the 1790s and India's religious disunity (a consequence of the Mughal empire which imposed Moslem ways on the Hindu basis) gave the Europeans a temporary advantage as younger sons of younger brothers led town scrapings into various ports in a variety of desparate actions.<br />Ponting's Europe is indeed an anomaly, a pimple, a burp from the World Spirit as it dreams in its mother's arms of the unquiet struggles of men, for he dates Europe's ascendancy in Eurasian terms from 1750 to 1940. And while the book was completed before September 11, September 11 clearly demonstrates the limits of American power, not least in revelations concerning how the attack by al-Qaeda was used to justify an attack on Saddam Hussein, in part because an incompetent American administration had literally no idea how to retaliate against a non-state actor.<br />For Ponting, China has been able over time to support a larger population with and fairer treatment of the peasants. He contrasts the Western systems of serfdom, primogeniture and slavery with the system in China in which the peasant was neither serf nor slave, and for the most part it did not occur to the father to so prize real estate over humanity, that the holdings were transferred to the eldest son, leaving younger sons (and, of course, daughters) to emigrate, force Eastern ports in desparate actions, marry \\"well\\", or starve.<br />Ponting's history is comparable to Zinn's in that he has a healthy focus on the meaning of history for the ordinary person (pretty much Stephen Daedalus' \\"nightmare from which I am trying to awake\\") and how long-term, inequality doesn't produce \\"growth\\". <br />There is nothing of what we would understand to be high culture in this book: Ponting doesn't think it important.<br />The danger is that of vulgar Marxism which so reduces \\"high\\" culture to \\"material basis\\" that it lets us imagine that we could get along without \\"high\\" culture, and, vulgar and stupid Marxists, notably Joe Stalin and Tse-Tung Mao, have used this reductionism to bullyrag and torment that which makes us most human while quiet men like Chou En-Lai do their best to protect it. Reductionist wars against \\"high\\" culture do the same dirty work as was done by the British Army in Beijing in the 1860s when it looted the Summer Palace: smash and grab.<br />Indeed, and world-wide, the era of the Cultural Revolution in China and the \\"Sixties\\" in the West were an era in which reductionist thinking appeared among the \\"masses\\" and they revolted in the way predicted by Ortega y Gasset against epiphenomena only to find thatso questioning the \\"material basis\\", say, of a midlevel college professor's existence leads to an infinite logical regress in which (in Hannah Arendt's analysis of Fascism) \\"everything is possible but nothing is true\\". Indeed, modern American politics bears at the epistemological level a striking resemblance to the politics of China during the late Cultural Revolution in which a family's private interest becomes \\"knowledge\\", leading of course to cynicism and despair.<br />Ponting however fails to apply a Fascist analysis to the events of the Cultural Revolution despite the fact that its devolution into battles between the PLA and student cadres over propositions undecidable because of reductionism (the failure, in other words, of that \\"piety\\" which in China derives from Kong Fuzu but which has other expressions) is strikingly like the epistemological anarchy which underlies the authoritarian gloss of European fascism.<br />But this is a minor objection. This World History should be read by all, especially Americans uneasy, to say the least, about the way they are being emotionally manipulated by vulgar and stupid ethnocentrism in a society in which the poverty rate is 12% and higher than contemporary China.<br />It may be said, in the whining tones of the reactionary commentator on hate radio, those tones that appeal to the worst in us, that Clive Ponting has some sort of pre-existing beef against the West. <br />But what the West looks like to the East ain't usually pretty. The facts seem to be that the West is mostly Aguirre, Wrath of God, proclaiming his dominance to the Amazon after slaughtering his own crew, the complete destruction of the Summer Palace in 1860 by ignorant slobs of the British Army, and the uncaring addiction of millions to opium in the 19th century and tobacco in the 20th century by Western firms.<br />Even Rudyard Kipling (of all people) knew that one day we in the West be \\"one with Nineveh and Tyre\\".<br />Availability note: resident in Shenzen, a suburb of Hong Kong over the border, I found this book at Page One in Kowloon Tong district of Hong Kong in print and published by Pimlico.	2004-03-27

US	50358924	R3V363J9LIPN2U	0486412482	732324309	The Cruise of the Snark (Dover Maritime)	Books	1	4	36	N	N	Stand in a shower tearing up 100 dollar bills instead	I've recently arrived back in the USA from Suva and Nadi in Fiji, one of Jack's stopping points.<br />However, what he describes about the South Pacific is no more.<br />London's South Pacific was affected by European trade and commerce. For one thing, disease, in an era when its prevention was primitive, was rife and the inhabitants of the islands he visited were dropping like flies. Today, of course, the very same network has brought modern medicine and the major health threat to natives in the South Pacific is obesity: the only restaurant on Victoria Parade in Suva, allowed Sunday hours, was McDonald's, while Singh's Curry Shop had to close (I recommend the latter, around the corner from McDonald's on Gordon Street: try the goat curry).<br />London's natives were partly pagan. Today, ordinary people in Oceania are mostly fundamentalist Christian, and, in Suva, there is also a streak of Islam, petering out far to the west of Indonesia but echoing in the afternoon call of the Muezzin in Suva.<br />The fundamentalism means that the yachtsman is well-advised on shore to dress modestly. Of course, London and his wife did this naturally, long ago. I actually saw an Australian man warn a woman in shorts in Suva to put knickers on lest one of the local Methodists or Moslems be offended.<br />But any myth of escape has been so commodified in the South Pacific by tavern owners and tourist companies as to be sour and bitter to the taste. <br />London, while asserting his property rights thoughtlessly at Oakland's wharf, and while assuming he had the right to hire men to work on his boat and judge their hard work in print, also assumed, in the South Pacific, his right to wander at will.<br />Today, as the Rough Guide to Fiji advises the tourist, 85% of the land in Fiji is owned fee simple by chiefs. Sir Arthur Gordon decided not to repeat America's dispossession of the Indians and covenanted with the lads in Fiji in such a way that today, the natives form a land-owning aristocracy.<br />Their fair-mindedness (as on display from Steve Rabuka who backed down from being a military dictator) means that other lads from other mobs have rough civic equality.<br />London was the prototype, however, of the colonialist as rugged individual whose humanity is based on the unconscious deprivation of others' humanity.<br />London was the prototype of the soured Yank who when a lad thought the best of people, without a dime to his name, who now has everything, and thinks the worst of people.<br />London with a grin repeats texts from the hundreds of letters he received from individuals who wanted to sign on to the Snark and so escape their own lives of quiet desparation in an America already unbearable for the average city-dweller. Like him they yearned for a clean-limbed life but unlike London they lacked cash.<br />London essentially uses their texts to pad out a book that was obviously written not from the heart but to raise cash for a silly boat. <br />Any yachtsman knows in his heart of hearts that if the landlubber wants his experience, he has only to stand in a cold shower tearing up 100 dollar bills. The Snark was an expensive lark and, like modern yachts, unconsciously offensive at both its sharp end (where were the natives, giving London gifts and dying like flies) and its blunt end (where were the American laborers whose work London disrespects because it was not finished on his schedule). <br />The South Seas are overrun, today, by people who really ought to be paying more taxes back home. I traveled out there to work at global rates and learned much more about the REAL South Seas than any tourist might, and I'm afraid that Joe Conrad, who also worked for a living, in The Heart of Darkness is more reliable on the tropics than old Jack London.<br />I'm afraid that London saw, what he wanted to see: the Gilded Age struggle of man against man. However, as Hannah Arendt points out in The Origins of Totalitarianism, this defines rather a culture of hatred out of which were form racialist identities. London was for the most part free of any special form of racism but he did believe that Socialism was impossible because Alpha males (like Wolf Larsen) would take what they need.<br />Well, they might, and they do. Nonetheless, in the South Seas and elsewhere, Beta males and women continue some how to achieve more, and of more lasting value, by working in groups. Sir Arthur Gordon is forgotten save in Suva, because unlike Cecil Rhodes he failed to mind his own press-agentry but it appears he did lasting good with his land-tenure scheme.<br />London never learned the limits of his world view and his darkest book, Alcoholic Memories, is a testament to London's limitations. <br />My favorite yachtsman remains good old Tristan Jones, a British sailor who was trained in the Royal Navy and who paid his dues. Tristan would like me arrive back, from the back of beyond, without a dime and go willingly to work while living willingly in a doss-house. Tristan dragged his own boat across the Mato Grosso and talked back to tinpot Fascists in Stroessner's Paraguay.<br />In my experience it is relatively easy to learn the mechanics of a sailing boat but what is hard is endurance, not only of Nature but the Other. London endured Nature but has a tendency to be impatient in print with others, as shown by his insenstive near-mockery of applicants for service on his boat. Jones, on the other hand, mocks only people who deserve it, like customs agents in Paraguay.<br />We lack Tristan Jones' spirit in America with the result that the Third World is overrun with the worst of us, whining yachtsmen and CIA agents and their trophy wives. London I fear was despite his genuine greatness of soul a prototype for the worse that came later.	2003-10-14

However, it is racist, sexist, and anti-Catholic: Maria Theresa Spermatazoa may amuse but also represents Catholics as inferior bodies to be controlled by Protestant minds.    Essentially, P. J. O'Rourke's entire career has been devoted to affirming the reality of a class structure which victimized him growing up in Ohio, and demonstrating that in America, there is no escape from the juvenile categories of high-school which enforce, in communities like Dacron, Ohio, the interests of the local \\"elite.\\"    Because of a defect in our Constitution, local \\"elites\\" in the real-life counterparts of towns like Dacron are over-represented in DC and their interests, chiefly the definition of success and worth with property owning, as a result control the political process.    This process had disastrous results in the 1960s as these elites led the football teams into Vietnam, and they've repeated the same mistake in Iraq.    But in both cases, \\"humor\\" is used to Manufacture Consent to shattered lives.    I was in other words amused to read of Gilbert \\"Univac\\" Scrabbler's career: the local Dacron nerd is now, in this book, living with Mom and Dad.    Well, PJ, my Mom is dead and I took care of my Dad, and yes indeed, the dot.com industry has busted. But basically, the ruination of lives in a country where unprecedented numbers of Americans are in poverty, thanks in small measure to the continual reassertion of racist, sexist, and classist categories in the guise of humor, eventually ceases to amuse.    The message of the humor is that \\"you are powerless, and your efforts to assert power are without meaning.\\" Fortunately, a critical mass of nerds, women, and other outliers have ignored this message.      UPDATE 11-19-2004    Thanks for all the accolades...intended and ironic. I even got in the Wall Street Journal, as a Complete Dork, for daring to point out that the target of the humor is the typical target of the typical bully: the\\"mark\\" who can't hit back.    Everybody who's objected to my comments has said that \\"awwww Ed, it's just HUMOR\\".    This is true. However, The National Lampoon from day one of its creation, like Saturday Night Live, evaded criticism of a white male establishment and targeted The Rest of Us.    In the NatLamp's case, and in the related case of SNL (which was under even more pressure from network execs) this has consistently involved mockery of egalitarian instincts, including (in NatLamp's case) several send-ups of \\"third-rate\\" universities...for people who have the bad taste not to be born, like our President, to a rich Mommy and Daddy.    When we were kids, way the hell back in the 1950s, we mocked kids who acted rich or were bad at sports, but a young feller in the digital cafe has informed me that when he attended New Trier High School in the 1990s, the pecking order was aligned, strictly, according to parental income.    These attitudes manufactured the election of George Bush, and I really don't care who anyone voted for.    Sure, in an ironic world, everybody \\"hates\\" the class president...and desparately wants to be him lest their aspirations be narrated as those of a sex object like Mary Catherine, or a dork.     My first sentence in the original review was on the level. I found the NatLamp and SNL funny especially when I was drunk-or-stoned.     At the same time, NatLamp and SNL, whether they intend to or not, Manufacture Consent to class war.    As a result of their generalized caricature of \\"third rate\\" universities, which discounts the hard work students perform to get there, Roosevelt University in Chicago was held up to ridicule in the Wall Street Journal in 1987 as a diploma mill. This was a university known as \\"the poor man's University of Chicago\\" which has consistently maintained high academic standards...certainly higher than the rather special set of standards imposed on George Bush.    Finally, it is no accident, I think, that service on NatLampor SNL is hazardous to one's health. John Belushi, John Candy, Danitravance, Phil Hartmann, Chris Farley were all victims, like Curley Howard, of an industrialized laff factory in which their talents were disregarded in favor of cheap and in Danitravance's case racist laffs, as were two editors of NatLamp.	2003-09-30

His subject is after all a more straightforward individual than John Nash, although Schwartz, like Sylvia Nasar, does explore some of the darker corners of Farnsworth's personality.<br />Schwartz refreshingly does not engage in positivistic technological whoop-de-doo about the possibility of reviving the status of the lone inventor. During the dot.com boom there was some loose talk about the possibility of the better mousetrap but it is clear that the administered world, that Farnsworth's nemesis in the book (David Sarnoff of RCA) helped to install in the 1920s, makes technological innovation, by the lone inventor, the exception and not the rule.<br />Schwartz also does an excellent job of balancing the two very different (yet strangely alike) personalities of Philo T. Farnsworth versus &quot;General&quot; Sarnoff, who more or less browbeat Dwight Eisenhower into making him a General for Sarnoff's admirable war record.<br />For Philo T. Farnsworth belonged more to the 1890s than the administered, corporate world of the 1920s. His name is somewhat odd in that (like Edward G. Nilges) it confesses an unbroken attachment to a family-of-origin, and a need to at one and the same time identify with a clan, yet precisely identify oneself as an individual within the clan.<br />Sarnoff's name is cooler-sounding and more down-to-business to the modern and indeed the administered ear, and far more than old Philo, Sarnoff was &quot;skilled&quot; (if that is indeed the word) in manipulating, not technical and scientific realities but his relations with his fellow men. <br />Farnsworth was of course no slouch in the PR department, but Sarnoff was more aware that the effect of illusion could be self-reinforcing, and that Sarnoff could USE the technology (and let others tinker with the technology), as in Schwartz' example of Sarnoff's dog and pony showat the 1939 World's Fair.<br />Technicians may cry foul, but the unavoidable fact that one technology builds upon another MEANS that the administered world (in Farnsworth's time, of cheap radio buff magazines, in ours, of cheap personal computers) was brought into being by social engineers *malgre lui* like Sarnoff.<br />But one cannot give old-fashioned credit to the Sarnoffs and the Gates when one admits this fact, and the reason for this is the inseperability of the social illusion they created, and the feeling the rest of us that we have been subtly horn-swoggled.<br />At the 1939 World's Fair, young David Gerlenter was very impressed by what in fact had little relationship to reality but the illusion created by the Fair urged him not only to participate in the creation of the world of &quot;tomorrow&quot;, it also made them enthusiastically not question its ideological presumptions.<br />Missing, of necessity, in Evan Schwartz' quick read is another (indirect) employee of David Sarnoff, and this is my cherubic but rather gloomy old pal Theodore Adorno.<br />[The frequency of mention of Adorno may indicate to the unwashed a stalker-like obsession although Adorno died in 1970, or it may indicate that I am on to something Big.]<br />Adorno was indirectly retained at the Princeton Radio Research project in the 1930s by an RCA funded group that was charged, by Sarnoff, with making radio more high-class, and Schwartz describes Sarnoff's own tastes, which were in the lingo of the day, high-brow.<br />Walter Damrosch, not &quot;Damrouch&quot; as it is in the book, was a popular classical conductor of the 1930s and performed, as Schwartz recounts, at an RCA celebration. Sarnoff hoped that Adorno, et al., would show him how to market, over radio and possibly television, &quot;quality&quot; programming.<br />Being an intellectual cousin of Farnsworth in the very different but in fact equally demanding field of sociology, Adorno seems to have disruptively wanted to first theorize the impact of Edison's, Marconi's, and Farnsworth's creations on the listener.  Adorno, in a truly pragmatic spirit, wanted to take the material basis into account, but was forestalled from doing so.<br />Adorno was aware, ten years before the appearance of McLuhan, that the medium, in particular its necessary limitations, might become the message. He theorized that the limitations might be necessary using, not the Aristotelean or Boolean logic familiar to a Farnsworth, but a 'dialectic' call and response logic in which we might actually demand, in the case of music reproduction, the very experience that denies, excludes, an older, and possibly richer, experience.<br />Of course, the engineer then and now is engaged in finding ways to satisfy demands, and not prove their mutual exclusion, which is why theoretical sociologists are scorned by engineers. But Boolean logic's possibility happens to rest on the bare possibility of knowledge, and one of Farnsworth's limitations was that this blinded him to the importance of PR over and above valid patents.<br />But rare indeed is the engineer with this range of vision, and as a result, engineers, in reading this book, might be subtly encouraged to POLARIZE the urban and cosmopolite world of Sarnoff versus the more down-to-earth, nuts and bolts, ham and ham sandwich world of an Edison or Farnsworth. With the result that such men grow old without grace, and the ultimate justification of the technology is biased towards destruction.	2003-09-04

As it was, the culture of Stalinism imposed a false image of reality completely at variance with daily life, as young Mikhail Gorbachev noticed growing up on a collective farm in the late 1940s. His heroism (uncelebrated because for the people of Russia he was in charge during a Time of Troubles) was that he bided his time, married well, and brought the curtain down on the untenable scene. We are in Mikhail Sergeyevich's debt (and, hurts me to say it, Ron Reagan's debt) for doing the job without a great big war.ene.

This is because both Rise and Fall, here, is a rise and fall of darkness, Nacht undt Nebel.<br />It has become somewhat fashionable in some circles on hate radio and and conservative media to be \\"brutal\\", as in \\"while other people lie and hedge the truth in order to spare the feelings of still others, I am a Man who speaks the Brutal Truth, like Bill O'Reilly, to those airy-fairy sprites who would tell each other what the shy folk do and what the servants say.\\"<br />Therefore let me be brutal: what possessed me to read Shirer's 1959 book was certain political changes in the United States.<br />Nacht undt Nebel was a political/legal program in Hitler's Germany in which people disappeared without information. To be brutal, John Ashcroft has stated that such detention, such disappearance, such night and fog, may be necessary to be brutal in the war on the terrorists.<br />On the ground, and as Shirer recounts, Nazi Germany used a systematic Volkisch anti-intellectualism to replace high-level college administrators (who otherwise might form centers of resistance) with men who were clearly unqualified by any intellectual measure for their positions (even Heidegger was significantly inferior to Husserl who he replaced.)<br />And when the intellectual deficiencies of these men were exposed a language was developed to explain it taken from 19th century Romanticism.<br />It was said that the passionate man, the man of blood and soil (blut undt boden) could not be content with long explanations (such as Al Gore's explanations of how Social Security could be funded), and indeed might get the details wrong but would nonetheless make out somehow.<br />As on MTV, prudery was systematically defiled in the camps of Baldur von Schirach's Hitlerjugend, and despite Baldur von Schirach's alarming name,he was half American. It is safe to say that there is a link between the American language's \\"nerd\\" and the German for \\"teacher's pet\\", and in turn a darker link to the Jew, who as a court favorite in the 18th century marshaled long-lived resentments.<br />American culture is based in part on the use sexual humiliation for social discipline and exposure in a way that seems universal but may be restricted to America today and Germany between the wars. <br />Upper middle class feminism in America today, for example, uses the threat of sexual humiliation to discipline men in offices, in revenge for the opposite use in former times. The very licentiousness and exposure of American culture, which struck me on return from a more prudish Fiji recently, becomes a disciplinary tool because it places on display a willingness to use sexual frankness to humiliate in a way not possible in a more prudish society.<br />The sexual humiliation of Emil Jannings in Der Blaue Engel is something very familiar in American cinema, but unseen in French cinema, for in French cinema intellectuals and teachers get lucky without having to change much; they continue to talk on, without end, about Rousseau and Derrida while jumping into bed.<br />Whereas in German and American cinema a sort of exchange must take place where the sexually repressed out-cast must join a sort of horde, or herd. Although films like Boys Don't Cry attempt to swim against the current, even transsexual people in America cluster with like souls for protection whereas the truly different remain cast out.<br />The parallels at the level of individual psychology are in other words disturbing.<br />That is why it is so necessary to read this great fat book. <br />Only then will the Germans of 1945 seem not so very alien. By 1945, and as Shirer recounts, they knew that they were following a real nut bar (as Shirer recounts, Hitler was not metaphorically a \\"carpet chewer\\": during staff conferences, when he did not get his ownway, old Schicklegruber would literally chow down on the Aubuisson.)<br />Yet they did anyway, and as Shirer recounts (getting in trouble with the old House committee in the USA on \\"Unamerican Activities\\") elements of the USA's leadership endeavored to PREVENT the men who kept Hitler in power from being called to account.<br />Joseph McCarthy, for example, old Tail Gunner Joe, prevented the prosecution of the SS officers who killed American prisoners of war during the Bulge. The key, as at Reagan's wreath-laying at the Bitburg ceremony, was probably that after all, they were officers whereas the GIs were union members and Communists.<br />The book opens an old wound and this is the very real possibility that any mass society may become a mirror for the worst in us and not the best in us, or at least, the average daily mediocre getting-along-in-spite-of-it-all in us.	2003-08-30
US	50358924	R264B62IRU7FGR	0804745285	911000457	Metaphysics: Concept and Problems	Books	5	16	18	N	Y	Organic precision	A theme of the late Adorno was the \\"organic\\" connection of linked terms: for the late Adorno, philosophy had the musical task of balancing claims at opposite ends of these organic polarities.<br />In Plato, Adorno shows, there is no conception of the reality of matter as opposed to Form; in Platonism, matter is merely Maya and illusion. Aristotle's insight was that the Form implies that we have to take an interest in matter because Form is always a Form-of with a material content. A square is in this picture filled with matter of some color; the perfect man has a material biography including encounters with the material (such as the Wedding Feast at Cana: marriage's sanctity is this transit of Venus.)<br />Nor, in Aristotle-Adorno, would the Form be at all improved by removing, in a Platonic spirit, as much matter as possible in a retreat from the world in search of \\"pure\\" form. Most mystics in the Hellenist period were consciously or unconsciously, Platonists who sought through reduction in contact with the material access to a mystical. As the twentieth century Islamic philosopher Sayyid Qutb has shown, this creates a cleavage or schizophrenia in Western thought: a divorce.<br />Western mental reservations about the goodness of the received, material, world result from the fact that (as Adorno shows) Aristotle quite straighforwardly prized the Form over the Content, preserving the Platonic value structure. Adorno shows that Aristotle did so because ancient philosophers had no clear conception of the dialectic.<br />Now, this is a claim of the sort that Adorno's very critics hunt for in the thicket of his prose like Indiana Jones, and, once they find this fool's gold, they fail to read on; for is it not the case that dialectic comes from the Greek? <br />Dialectic did come from the Greek but Continental philosophers don't mean by \\"dialectic\\" its root meaning of conversation, instead something more like talking to oneself in which the philosopher is literally sundered by the overpowering structure of his thought at the point where he realizes that as a part of the historical world he must self-apply his philosophy, treating himself as Other.<br />It is at this point that contradictions emerge which point the way not to collapse but to a new structure. <br />Adorno's dialectic, which he found absent in Aristotle, was one in which the Concept makes its own demands upon the thinker who winds up, not compromising with the World Spirit but in wholehearted agreement with its necessity. <br />We have to cultivate Adorno's remarkable ability to think in three dimensions here and historically; for thanks to Orwell, the very phrase, \\"wholeheartedly in agreement with the necessity of the World Spirit\\" becomes Winston Smith at the end of 1984. In fact, Adorno, despite the simple-minded demonology of the American right, was not at all wholeheartedly in agreement with the NOWS after the Holocaust and his negativity, also a matter of paradoxical scorn in American circles, generated his thought after 1945. <br />The canard of the American right is that European intellectuals of the 1950s like Adorno somehow manufactured the Stalinism of the 1930s (sic.: if you're going to lie, lie big: it is unexplained how the future influenced the past.) <br />Another canard of the American right is the attempt to pin responsibility for the Holocaust, ahistorically, on European intellectuals, and Adorno is usually in the round-up of the usual suspects. The Hegelian belief in the reality of moral progress is portrayed as generating schemes, for social improvement, which generate schemes, for mass murder, as if privatized schemes do not also have their own potential, almost by default. <br />For Adorno, there was no empirically attainable way to attain redemption after the death camps. For the Anglo-American philosopher, who Adorno represents in this book as the deracinated Wittgenstein, \\"die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist\\" (the world is what happens), theHolocaust as a fact therefore closes the matter: we find an echo of this in the facticity of interviews, on horror, of The Guy in the Bar...s seen, for example, in Claude Lanzmann's Shoah.<br />The Guy says \\"get over it,... don't bring it up, Die Welt ist alles, was der Fall ist.\\" Adorno's nemesis (like the Guy on the Weimar street-car who yelled at young Ted for his pretentious speech, pretentious speech being close to the language of redemption: like the knucklehead on the El who yelled at my kid for reading a book), the Guy is unconsciously influenced by Positivism and concludes from the empirical horror of Stalinism and the Holocaust that there is no \\"redemption\\", only revenge, only Tony Soprano, bada-bing. <br />The Guy in the Bar, an irresponsible philosopher in the sense that this clown witlessly inherits philosophy without examination, is, in his schizophrenic willingness to divorce form from content, in charge of modern American media...in which the form of facticity and polls drive what passes for political thought. Die Welt ist Alles, was Herr Gallup sprachen.<br />Adorno's ghost is needed to exorcise Guys in Bars, including those with tenure.<br />Adorno realized that form and content exist in an organic unity. Language that witlessly forgets this is the sort of political language that takes upon a favored form such as \\"freedom\\" without bothering to fill the form with content such as free men and women, and instead, in the Name of the Form, fills America's jails. <br />Half-educated, half-indoctrinated bien pensants are then systematically gulled into support for crime following the empty signifier of the Form. This has in my experience reduced and brutalized smart people to Guys in Bars.<br />Metaphysics is not palmistry, nor theology, nor the posit of supernatural entities. Nor is it restricted by any known law to the mulish rejection of an excess over der Fall. It is instead an ongoing critique of the very attempt to grope beyond and this critique itself is evidence for the Unseen: it is a rumor of redemption, and that is all we need: that is all we deserve.	2003-06-19
US	50358924	R2B1X5KV4VLJI1	0449908585	522504663	Happy Isles of Oceania: Paddling the Pacific	Books	5	5	21	N	N	The happy wanderer	This is one of the books I have taken, along with Lonely Planet's guide to Fiji, on a voyage, which may be one-way, from Chicago to Suva (Fiji's capital) and Fiji. I recommend this book, wholeheartedly.<br />Paul Theroux is clearly on the right side of that well-worn distinction in travel writing, between the tourist and the traveler. Although many excellent guides (notably those from Lonely Planet) try to cater to both sides, in general, travel books are either written by tourists who've been hornswoggled by the locals, or by real travelers.<br />One genre of tourist book is the right-wing tirade against the society visited by the writer. It is an offensive American habit to announce one's bien-pensance by traveling the world and finding fault with the sanitation and architecture of other countries. <br />P. J. O'Rourke is an amusing fellow but ultimately rather dreary in that he blames the victim in his book Holidays in Hell. As it happens, writers on the right, who blame Third World capitals for crumbling architecture, or nonworking toilets, would do well to reflect on the simple physical properties of materials in heat and humidity, or the exorbitant trade school fees that parents in underdeveloped lands must pay, for their children to be educated in plumbing trades. <br />Which isn't to say that Theroux fails to identify negative features of the Pacific islands, which, for him, include its anti-intellectualism and the colonialist dependence most apparent in American Samoa, where a government, in order to secure the territory, does indeed kill traditional  custom and future initiative (as a conservative would predict) by a system of thoughtless handouts...made after all in self-interest.<br />People in developed countries first romanticise the indigneous and are apt, when encountering its anti-intellectualism and suspicion of the outsider, to switch, like Mistah Kurtz in The Heart of Darkness, and Brando in Apocalypse Now, to the horrorshow view. Theroux is farmore nuanced and this allowed him to deal with the sort of frightening scene he encountered both in the wilds and in American Samoa, of bullying of an adult loner by a group of local kids.<br />Being torn apart by children is a nameless fear of intellectual loners; Robert Crumb has a panel in which a kid announces to his father, \\"hey, Pop, we burnt a bum at recess.\\" Theroux is exceptional, in facing this fear as did brother Adorno, in Adorno's essay \\"Fascism is the nightmare of childhood\\". <br />However, Theroux does not regard indigneous people as Fascists and instead accounts for their dislike of the outsider as a rational need for family and clan cohesion, the most important fact of their lives. <br />To maintain a generally positive outlook on people with a healthy critical spirit is a rare accomplishment. It is easier to adopt the pose of Shakespeare's Jaques and to conclude the worst from one's travels.<br />Americans, at least before Sep 11, were friendly travelers who liked everybody. Far rarer is the traveler who judges but based on observation. One type of South Pacific denizen Theroux does not like was manufactured by the triumphalism of Reagan and the elder Bush, and Bob Hawke of Australia, he of the cockatoo's pompadour.<br />This is the Aussie, Kiwi, Brit or American prone to make generalizations about other groups and nature itself, the bore of the saloon bar. The most attractive features of the matey Australasian personality of the 1960s, who voted instinictively for liberals as long as they promised swagmen a fair shake was erased by CIA disruption in the 1970s (this is fact, not paranoia) and replaced by a property-owning swagman democracy. <br />Property-owning swagmen democracies are better than most political arrangements. We Yanks invented the idea of expropriating the toffee-noses and becoming utter swine in our turn: but expropriation results in insecurity which often emerges in boozy conversations in countless pubs and distraction from distraction by distraction, as the antics of powerless Royals, and Governor-Generals in pantaloons, conceals the sort of raw work one has seen in the US CIA's Australian monkeyshines, the silencing of British Labor on the war, the French nuclear nonsense, and the elimination of New Zealand's David Lange, who Theroux met in the Marquesas.<br />Of course, the above paragraph might be read as complementary to and effectively the same as the worst kind of saloon bar rhodomontade and ordinary people may well ask, where does Theroux get off, or a fortiori, where do I (the answer at this writing is Suva Bay.) People who don't as a rule read books, including many sun gods and goddesses of the South Pacific, are apt to call such writing \\"generalization\\" and to remark, with passion, that it might hurt someone's feelings, one of the writer's occupational hazards, along with late checks and the bottle, being the bearer of bad news that hurts strangers and their Mum.<br />But if the charge sticks, then any kind of writing outside of sailing manuals would have to disappear. <br />There are curious parallels between Theroux's situation, and my current situation. He wrote at the time of the first Gulf War, I write this review after the end of the second. He was recently divorced (a strike against him in the traditional cultures of the South Pacific, where I've already been asked my marital status) and I started reading Theroux at the time of my own divorce. Today, far more so than in 1981, the culture makes no provision for the divorced man who is expected to do Protestant penance, or else wander the isles gibbering and capering in the tropic moonlight.<br />No provision, today, is made for the partially shriven, and partially lost, soul. Instead, the Americans would convert him to Yankee salvation and go-ahead schemes. The sturdy sons of England, Canada, and Australia would buy the old lad of the castle strong drink. Distant drummers are after all unheard by one's mates, who can't figure out what makes yer go. In consequence, your old lad of the castle becomes set apart in thought.	2003-05-15

It is funny and well-written, but as is the case with most books in the genre of business advice, it shouldn't be taken too seriously, or too literally.<br />Most successful players know very well that buying a book of advice on how to succeed at the office (as opposed to a technical, engineering, or serious financial book) means one has already lost.  Most successful players know that the people making money are too busy making money to advise the general public how to make a bundle, and even if they have secrets of wealth, it is not in their self-interest to tell anyone else.<br />Baruch Spinoza, the 17th century philosopher, noticed this.  When he started out in the business world, Spinoza got whacked because as an intellectual he was naive, and expected other people to share information freely.  As a result of his experience, the guy retired from the business world and, supporting himself with lens grinding and the occasional hand-out from an aristocratic patron, developed his philosophy basically for the hell of it.<br />And as it happened, Spinoza's philosophy sharply distinguished limited, &quot;empirical&quot; ends, from the intellectual's love of the inexhaustible manifestations of a pantheistic G-d.<br />&quot;Empirical&quot; ends have the advantage is that their attainment is empirically verifiable, in Spinoza's time by external signs of wealth such as houses and art, and in ours by the same, and credit reports.<br />&quot;Empirical&quot; ends (as Spinoza shows in The Ethics) have a significant downside.  As empirical ends, they involve the goal seeker in a necessary collision with his fellow man in which as Ringer says, he will only win by &quot;intimidation.&quot;<br />Whereas intellectual work, from development of free software to higher mathematics and beyond, seeks information, which, in the slogan of the Open Source movement, &quot;wants&quot; to be free.<br />For example, in software, one is struckby an extreme contrast between development activities where the profit motive is accentuated as opposed to development activities where it is de-emphasized.  The former (as the profit motive's strength increases along a continuum) is indeed one in which any Survivor knows it's eat or be eaten, intimidate or get whacked.  <br />This type of development is characterized by high rates of hidden bugs.<br />The latter type of more &quot;open&quot; development is characterized by more friendly relations with one's fellow men and women, but less money, of necessity.<br />Actually, Robert J. Ringer's book should be taken seriously in one sense as a presentation of what it is actually like when empirical ends are emphasized.  It is so damn honest that it is a useful corrective, for people starting out in the business world, against any form of starry-eyed notion that corporations, as corporations, are about much of anything EXCEPT making money.<br />It is an illusion to think that any but the largest and most profitable corporations will willingly fund anything resembling pure research or Spinoza's gaze on any sort of damn inexhaustible manifold.  &quot;Intellectual love of G-d?  There's the door, chump.&quot;<br />Knowing this allows us with some serenity to choose to enter or to leave the struggle for empirical ends on the at-will basis: for a good reason (baby needs a new pair of shoes), a bad reason (retiring at 25) or no reason at all.<br />Having said this, it remains the case that Ringer was and is a part of an American *kulturkampf* which has overly foregrounded empirical ends in order to defuse political activism.  It began when Reagan defined America as a place where everyone could become rich, which was a mathematical impossibility interpreted literally, and which (due to Spinoza's necessary collision of man against man) has significantly brutalized American life and, today, resulted in a prison population of more than 2 million.<br />Apart from many African American jailbirds who pay for my country's bone racism, most white and many black prisoners merely internalized crude and demotic forms of the high-class ideology of whack or be whacked that appears in the thinking of the Hoover Institution and Paul Wolfowitz.  <br />And, don't get me started on what happens when this Walpurgisnacht of self-seeking overflows its boundaries and grabs foreign oil sources.<br />Those of us who have worked both sides of the street know that in this world, empirical goal-seeking in an honest but at times intimidating manner is necessary.  But we also see that the system of capitalism feeds upon something outside of itself, especially information-based capitalismus.  This is the product of dancers, artists, musicians, scientists, writers and computer programmers who dance, paint, compose, research, scribble and code because of a committment to the truth of a gesture, or an efficient computer program.<br />And today it is the work product of exhausted soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who simply aren't paid enough to go without sleep for days on end and do, essentially, the NYSE's work: because a military defeat will cause a stock market crash and the delisting of most of the exchange.  <br />This is tragic.  It is also reality.  Read Ringer in order to learn from his brutal honesty that this is what much of reality is.  Read Spinoza or read the Sermon on the Mount to realize what this reality feeds upon, like Goya's Saturn, eating his children.  Read King Lear to learn of the return to original chaos that results when people, like Goneril and Regan, internalize winning through intimidation.	2003-04-07

The bonafide purpose of an introduction to a first rate thinker is to give the student a precis of the first rate.<br />But the obvious question, one raised by Adorno in his lectures on Kant, is why the student needs a mentor to explain the guru.<br />Adorno's answer was that Kantianism exists in partial independence from Kant and even from Kant's thought, in the sense that Kant raised concerns that Kant did not have the time to think through.<br />There is nothing mystical about this. It may result in part from the fact that Kant himself, in Keyne's image, heard &quot;voices in the air&quot; in the form of thoughts that arose out of material struggles during Kant's epoch.<br />Unfortunately, Witkin seems unaware of this possibility and provides instead a precis of &quot;Adorno on Popular Culture&quot; which reduces Adorno's thought to a biographical series of complaints about the way in which popular culture moronizes its consumer.<br />This biographical approach forces Witken unconsciously and by default into the role of answering Adorno, and laying Adorno to rest; Witkin becomes an Adorno antibody in the manner of antibodies to the HIV virus which are the diagnosis of AIDs.<br />In Adorno's own words and Adorno's own theory (which is almost never self-applied by texts in the Adorno industry) the thing represented is conquered by its representation in a way that has the Tedster, probably, spinning in his grave.<br />Witkin's Adorno machine is constructed by a scholar who is tone deaf to the music of the dialectic.  <br />Witkin's Adorno machine emits racist music about jazz and Witkin seems to fail to realize that in the 1930s and 1940s, the word &quot;jazz&quot; was coterminous with popular music in an era before Coltrane.  Adorno should not be forgiven, in writing about American music, for his apparently complete failure to inform himself about country blues and Scott Joplin but when asked to write about Jazz, he used the word in the same way ordinary GI's of occupied Germany used the word.<br />Witkin's major case against his Adorno machine is Woody Allen, a filmmaker who probably knows about Adorno: an Adorno figure appears in Woody's Hannah and Her Sisters.<br />Allen's films considered as a static *oeuvre* are thought by Witkin to constitute a riposte or counterexample to Adorno, for they are films with mass appeal that do not reject &quot;inwardness and erudition.&quot;<br />The problem is the failure to apply Adorno's deep methodology.  When he appeared in the 1920s in Weimar Germany, his colleagues were struck by the thoroughgoing influence of dialectical thinking on Adorno's details of thought and for better or worse, this makes a thinker unlikely to think in terms of a closure, which Witkin is seeking in raising the case of Woody Allen.<br />Witkin fails both the appreciate Hegel, and read Variety: for in fact, ever since the 1980s, Allen's personal and professional reputation have been under continual attack beginning with accusations about his relationships with his step-daughter.<br />The horror was based on the failure, of a large number of moviegoers, to connect with a Manhattan island of inwardness and erudition that was, in this period, diminishing both in Manhattan, and, at a rapid rate, elsewhere.<br />During Reagan's presidency, universities in self-defense conducted a *kulturkampf* on universites, and inwardness and erudition, in the form of commodified education, the replacement of tenured faculty with adjunct faculty, and student moronization.<br />The modal Allen clone became in this period a figure under increasing suspicion, and Allen himself expresses his rather bitter reaction to this in Deconstructing Harry.<br />The dialectic was not suspended, and a frozen, hypostatized Adorno not counter-exampled and demolished by Allen's now very retro oeuvre.  Instead the gradual brutalization of the Allen &quot;type&quot; becomes a confirmation of Adorno'scritique and more interesting than old Woody Allen films.<br />University faculty too often survive by pretending to celebrate liberation while in fact performing an older ideological function: thought control, and ensuring that things don't get outa hand.  The reassurance, however, that popular culture is in any way a medium by means of which ordinary people can express their needs or find satisfaction is malarkey.<br />The reassurance requires Witkin's nonsensical theory of transparency of communication (something predemolished by Adorno in The Jargon of Authenticity) in which the mechanisms of popular culture provide a way for fellow spirits to communicate in Buber's mode, and eliminates a &quot;third&quot; term consisting of a shared set of ideals, considered unnecessary and indeed Quixotic.<br />The problem is that for Cervantes as for Adorno, humanity is the reverse of a brutalized, face-to-face, &quot;I and thou&quot; humanity which in fact is the face of one-on-one authority.  Don Quixote was able to escape this exhausting struggle not by reification but by integrating an ontology into his praxis in a redemptory way..<br />It is dehumanizing to so erase the possibility of shared ideals and Witkin fails to show how this creates anything but twilight struggle in the name of &quot;authenticity.&quot;<br />As I write, abstract ideals labeled Quixotic a year ago are proving to have weight, like the physicist's light.  The Bush administration finds itself today in front of an obsidian wall, carved with serpent shapes, expressing abstract Enlightenment ideals and although it may circumvent this barrier it will be perceived, world-wide, as untrue to its own professed ideals.  This will have enormous consequences for the United States in the real world of economics and diplomacy.<br />American media uses a jargon of authenticity and indeed, a debased, confrontational I and thou ethical style to REDUCE the hard work of arms inspectors to a series of completely misleading sound bytes.  It is an anti-Quixote in that it refuses to test its results against any texts, whether chivalric novels or the Charter of the UN.<br />In this context, we do not need to exorcise Adorno but instead to channel him.	2003-03-14
US	50358924	R3P70I3Z1GR523	0393041832	967454060	The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder	Books	5	30	39	N	N	Deep pathology	Miller's Bush is no Adlai Stevenson: but, Bush is no Yogi Berra, either. <br />The Bush style is clear only when expressing anger, appealing to avarice with false promises, hiding the fact of lust, encouraging sloth and gluttony and business as usual in response to Sep 11, explaining theft as economic growth, and inciting to false national pride. <br />At best Bush-ese simulates a demonic translation into corporatese of less meaningful parts of the Christian bible. The effect was last seen in a book called \\"The Boomer Bible\\", a hilarious summa of the intellectual limitations, lack of compassion, and false religiosity of the worst of a generation.<br />The Boomer Bible cheerfully sums up the ignorance and self-justification of the sort of Baby Boomer who sold out, and regards his intellectual and moral universe as the only universe worth considering.<br />A small defect of the Bush Dyslexicon is that Miller treats Bush as an individual and not as a Boomer type.<br />Bush is a result of a decline from Prescott through through the President. Prescott's generation saw its pre-war position threatened by labor unions, people of color, and the enlarged post-war middle class that no longer listened to classical music on Sunday.<br />The Bush *famiglia* has pulled, over time, a stunt pulled by many leading American families over the past fifty years. These families were led by absent, weak or overbearing fathers too busy at the CIA to be fathers: their scions, rather than step up to the hard work of democratic leadership, wasted Ivy League educations or dropped out. The previous lower tiers, the engineers, the middle managers, were downsized and then replaced by the declining members of the old elite...or, in Bush's case, are beguiled by phony populism into following a false good ole boy.<br />Among themselves, the lads enforced a conformity merely masquerading as \\"freedom\\" in which anything higher than Bluto was mocked, and financial success became the only criterion of truth (a sign in the 1989 Princeton p-rade: \\"The Nation in Princeton's Service.\\")<br />Growing up in a family where this was in progress, perhaps the current President realized that cultivated, complex or even coherent, speech (and, *a fortiori*, writing) would be a disadvantage, because of the trickery involved in the change to an invisible nomenklatura.<br />Complex speech would be mined for negatives: coherence could be used against the writer and the speaker in a court of law or at the SEC.<br />This phenomenon is widespread. A telling moment occured when Al Gore gave a complete and coherent account of the changes in Medicare. Bush responded with the \\"fuzzy math\\" soundbyte. <br />Bush's pseudo populism is being exposed as I write. Over a period of about forty-five minutes on the morning of March 6 after Bush's press conference, only two callers expressed support to the CSpan phone in line for the President.<br />Both callers were reduced to a Fundamentalist simplicity in which the ONLY comfort available was the bald fact of the President's complete mediocrity: the hope is for a general salvation unlinked to works, such as math.<br />This Fundamentalism of the self is a zero-sum game, no longer trickle-down.<br />Bush isn't the same old, same old: not just another Republican, not just an almagam of Richard Nixon's hatred of humanity, and Eisenhower's apparent lack of verbal skill. <br />In the family dynamics inside the Bush clan, we see growing dysfunction. Bush's confrontations with Poppy show that neither had learned how to live together, job one of sons and fathers. Bush's daughter's behavior needs only to be compared with Chelsea's academic and romantic triumphs to show that the Bush family, absent its money, is just another declining New England clan, drowning its sorrows in booze or dry drunks.<br />But it's one thing to smash up the car; the Bushes have smashed up the Republic and its world standing even on their own selfish terms.<br />Aliteracy, which shades into illiteracy, may seem minor. The problem is that words as words point outside and are linked with reality.<br />Compare this paragraph written by a former President, U. S. Grant:<br />\\"It would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that overcame me at the news of these assassinations [Lincoln and Seward], most especially the assassination of the President. I knew his goodness of heart, his generosity, his yielding disposition, his desire to have everybody happy, and above all his desire to see all the people of the United States enter again upon the full privileges of citizenship with equality above all.\\"<br />Compare George Bush's theocratic, rambling and repetitious words after September 11... which, as Miller shows, continually leave mourning and return to Bush's favorite topic of a \\"revenge\\" illegal under international law and with an illdefined target that today is Saddam Hussein.<br />However, Bush's speech of 9-14-2001 does pass corporate tests, such as lack of \\"verbosity\\" where \\"verbosity\\" means \\"density of ideas\\" and not of words (Bush's repetitions are not this \\"verbosity.\\")<br />Grant FAILS this test for in one paragraph, and with conciseness interpreted as a ratio of words to ideas, Grant identifies two assassinations, paints an accurate word picture of Lincoln, and moves to Lincoln's goals for Reconstruction.<br />Whereas what Bush said was \\"this was terrible, just terrible and makes us cry (ah'm a lovin guy), and we need to whack someone 'cause we're special.\\" <br />As a result, the United States has suffered a massive diplomatic defeat, and is threatening to violate the UN Charter.<br />As I write, Dennis Hastert is boasting that when he was struggling as a teacher in Illinois, he took the advice of his school principal, who called Hastert's degree in \\"hisstry and philassaphy\\" useless and advised a certificate in \\"supervision.\\"<br />The rest, for the Speaker, was \\"hisstry\\", and his \\"philassaphy\\" is clear, as is his President's philassaphy. <br />You don't need hisstry and philassaphy, just a certificate and a mentor, and a preloaded Supreme Court. Writing and speaking with clarity need not apply.	2003-03-07
US	50358924	R2Z4AZ4OMUISMV	0142002550	430547680	Fugitive Days: A Memoir	Books	5	18	46	N	N	Maybe down in Mexico, or a picture upon somebody's shelf	What's astonishing is that it took so long.<br />History is, we can see, the retelling of another's story by the winners.  As such, even the most intelligent people, over the last thirty years, have the vague image of clueless radicals blowing themselves to smithereens in a town house owned by someone's Daddy.<br />The problem is that these were people who took their parent's best hopes very seriously and with a stunning lack of that irony which is now an ersatz for thought.<br />Their parents were already aware, in 1956, that Stalinism was a dead end, and they did not need Irving Kristol to tell them so, for their parents did not need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.  Their parents, along with the children, nonetheless asked why they had to live, minute to minute, under a sentence of nuclear death.<br />They looked to the best of their children, people like Diana Oughton, who worked in Guatemela for the poor, for something like redemption.  <br />Was this wrong?  What's not to like?<br />I am named after a man sacrificed uselessly on the von Manstein line, and after WWII, Republicans and Democrats took the United Nations charter seriously because of this human sacrifice.  Quite a number of elite parents supported their radical kids but felt their methods extreme.  <br />The parents failed to see the shadow of American life which was at that time appearing in its as-yet-ungentrified cities, cities which had never really recovered from the Depression.  The brown shoes who followed Ayers, after all, might be labeled police and thereby benefit from police PR but any real policeman knows that they were bums with an agenda as is every other denizen of the city.<br />And, it now appears, that ABSENT the weatherpeople, what you get is the USA Patriot Act and the threat, by the United States, to committ a war crime.  <br />Compared to the IRA and especially to United States international actions over the past fifty years, the violence of the Weatherman was genuinely surgical and not just represented as such: for in our \\"surgical\\" strikes we blame computers for errors...such as the destruction of a bomb shelter on Feb 13, 1991 by two American cruise missiles, which had been correctly programmed with the incorrect target.<br />Like Billy Crystal in the Saturday Night Live sketch, we have learned how to selectively refuse moral agency, for when Billy Crystal's security guard rubs ground glass in his nostrils he says \\"I hate when that happens.\\"  When we bomb people we hate when that happens.  It's just collateral damage, and, according to Madeleine Albright, \\"acceptable\\" and indeed made so by the ritualistic application of a label by a prestigious spokesperson.<br />Precisely because the Weathermen had to take hands-on responsibility, at great danger to their lives, for their actions, they could oversee the technology every step of the way.  Bill's Pentagon bomb, for example, was accompanied by a warning to clear the area and it quite surgically destroyed mainframe computers that were mismanaging the air war...in a way that is secretly satisfying to any ordinary computer programmer of that era, who in fact knew that the technology was a Potemkin village and completely unequal to the task.<br />However, the end of thug Communism shows that even this type of low tech but accurate bombing is NOT the way to end the potential war in Iraq.  The Internet instead allows people to gather in designated spots as they did world-wide on Feb 15 and this sends a more powerful message (the more primitive Internet and Xerography performed this function in Eastern Europe in the 1980s.)  <br />Here, Bill tells his own story and after being face-down, like the Jack of Hearts, for so many weary years of Yuppiedom and fraud, returns to the honky-tonk in answer to Big Jim, that Empty Suit that has had his way for thirty years with the environment and people's hopes.<br />I was already struggling to find a career and support myself when in 1970, some of Bill's friends, possibly the big man himself, came on board the El with the strange eyes of extremity.  They tried to not look upon us mere mortals with scorn but they were clearly in another world.<br />The problem is that today, that same world, those now air-conditioned El cars, are filled with ads telling the losers who do not drive to work to clean their clothes and not have so many kids.  <br />The problem is that when the people on the CTA go to a college they can afford, their professors are not professors at all but drill instructors.<br />They say Rousseau was wrong.  Right or wrong, the problem is a logical dilemma.  Once the old wanker of Geneva let the cat out of the bag, and said, clear enough, that man is born free but everywhere in chains, then whether or not man is born free but everywhere in chains, man is EITHER born free and able to live with others OR in an ultimately unmanageable struggle with others for survival.<br />He is either a kid excited by a trip with Bill and Diana Oughton by a trip to workplaces to see work done, or a feral examination passer and workplace Stinky Pete, cruel towards the weak and subservient towards the strong.<br />He either sighs, \\"they must know what they are doing\\" when confronted with the death of a million children in Iraq or he concludes that if man is born free but everywhere in chains, then something must surely be done and no, they don't have a clue and are as Dumb and Dumber, if more dangerous, than a drunken clown in a bar.<br />Today, in America, the cabaret is quiet and a sign says \\"closed for repairs.\\"  But Big Jim is planning wastage in preference to sharing the proceeds of the late unlamented orgy.  As in Rome on the night of Caesar's assassination, ghosts like Bill squeak and gibber in the streets, their words having been restored to meaning and truth.  In the old play, a slave's arm was on fire, and they say, a man on fire got off the elevator on the first floor of the world trade center.<br />The world has indeed changed, but instead of concluding we need a Fascist state to respond to an indefinable terrorism, many people may be rereading the history of the Weathermen and what they were about.  Not to repeat their mistakes but to learn how to change things today.	2003-02-25
US	50358924	RVR2YL75UIVUU	0745617816	143518995	Hegel: An Intellectual Biography	Books	5	3	13	N	N	The wisdom of a young man: the folly of an old man	Horst Altaus has done here an excellent job.  We are curious about philosophers as men and women because philosophy is somewhat more intimate than science, and Hegel was present at a time of rapid change: during the Napoleonic wars, he saw first hand his \\"dialectic\\" in which the German states were turned topsy-turvy by world souls on horseback.<br />Altaus intersperses his chapters with readable digests of Hegel's major works.<br />There is the obligatory comment about Hegel's complex style, combined with rather patronizing praise of the simplicity and elegance of a minor work on the Württemburg constitution: for we often find that to ascribe the label \\"difficult\\" to the style or the man committs what psychologists call a fundamental attribution error.<br />For we find that Hegel could use, in his minor work, a style appropriate to the theme.  It is said that the style should be appropriate to the audience as if that was something we could control, but Hegel's troubles with getting enough students to attend his lectures, documented by Altaus, show both that operationalism of this sort was not his cup of tea, and that it is less fundamental than the duty of the author towards reality.<br />People are difficult and their style is difficult when they try to impress (although anyone who today uses a difficult style merely to impress aliterate administrators and deans needs his head examined), but perhaps more often when they find themselves wrestling, like Jacob, with angels.<br />Hegel wrote simply when writing on mere constitutions, as did John Adams.  But his larger theme required on his part a couple of barrels of books, dragged about Germany by primitive transportation, and while his ethnocentrism is obvious, Hegel's philosophy of history remains in some ways up to date.<br />Hegel's texts have the curious property that they share with Kant that unlike mathematical or scientific works, one gets the impression that \\"if this stuff is true, not only could it not be otherwise, its-being-put-otherwise would not make any sense at all.  On the other hand, however, if this stuff is false, it is not false, but without any sensible meaning, whatsoever.\\"<br />IF the struggle for recognition is the motor of consciousness and of history, then any alternative story is gibberish, which is interesting, for Hegel's story is confusing enough.  <br />And, it's gibberish precisely because of its proposed theme, which is everything.  <br />Science considers the alternate worlds and chooses the true world, but the alternate worlds can be pictured.  True philosophy on the other hand, is concerned with the only world, whether we interpret that as the set or join of all possible worlds, or a world in which all possibilities will come to pass.<br />This alone I think generates the \\"complex bad\\" style of Kant and of Hegel. <br />Hegel should be read by philosophers of consciousness, and Althaus is a good introduction: for contemporary theorists may be making fundamental mistakes.<br />IF our consciousness is formed by the Other from day one, then this would predict that fetal alcohol syndrome victims and children deprived of contact with their others have no consciousness as we experience it from the inside.  <br />It means that \\"scientific\\" explanations of consciousness that hypostatize individual minds are doomed.  No model of consciousness makes sense if it \\"works\\" in a world populated by only one consciousness.  Just as mathematics requires existence assertions, consciousness requires a stronger assertion: in the beginning there is neither zero nor one but two (Madonna and child.)<br />Horst includes more patronizing material on Hegel's scientific views which he shared with Goethe.  They may seem to Altaus to be a dead end but forms of them survive in deep ecology.  They were replaced by reductionism which, paradoxically, points of Thomas Kuhn's Oedipal destruction of old paradigms and technical whizbang as its own ultimate ratio regium.  It is areductionism which is unable to master complexity because its gesture is a hand-wave, from simple initial conditions to complex results, that in an idealist gesture ignores labor.<br />It is clear that like many intellectuals, Hegel compromised himself later in life by becoming an ideologue for the Prussian state.  But while the dialectic is not a license for easy self-contradiction (as Hegel's friend Goethe feared) there is a genuine dialectic between the hero of the chapter on lordship and bondage in the Phenomenology of Mind, and the apologist for a state church.  <br />For all other things being equal, we would like to live in a society that reflected our deepest needs and one that did not demand principled retirement.  But history, as I write, staggers on.<br />Althaus shows that Hegel, as many attackers have said, may have compromised himself by at the end of his life, identifying the World Spirit with the Prussian state.  <br />This is, of course, ethnocentrism run amuck.  But Hegel's views were not evaluative.  As Altaus shows, he was concerned with description of a sort that would sensibly relate individual psychology to history.<br />Hegel's poltical philosophy gives no basis whatsoever for resistance to a state, or paradoxically it can be reread as revolutionary counsel.  <br />For if one lives in the best state, or even one that merely is the state in which the world spirit has set up shop for good or ill, revolution is either evil or futile, or both.  If the state is the home of a benign world spirit, Casper the Friendly Weltgeist, then resistance is evil.<br />But if (as commentators after Hegel have noted, especially Adorno) Hegel provides no reason why the world spirit may not be perceived as bad or evil in its effects on our lives, revolution is futile and evil, being futile, everything else being considered.<br />In short, reading the biography of the later Hegel illustrates how old age can be lethal for philosophy.  The later Marx showed some of the same intellectual decay as his carbuncles got the better of him.  As T. S. Eliot wrote, \\"do not tell us of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly.\\"	2003-02-03

Its foundations post-dated a universal church and pre-dated the Enlightenment.  <br />The justification of common law is its origin in a time out of mind for \\"time out of mind\\" releases jurists from the Godlike role by means of precedent.  International law's foundations are shakier, for *jus sovereignis* is the will of dead white males.  <br />International law predated the idea that rights flow not from the sovereign but from  people and therefore is an intellectual and moral anomaly.  Anomalies like American slavery tend to produce disasters, and the anomaly of *jus sovereignis* produced the Balkan disaster, as old-school diplomats seemed compelled to stand idly by.<br />Diplomacy and international law seem to the layperson to be a pleasant affair involving  bun-fights, at the better sort of spa.  The problem is the Monty-Pythonesque intrusion of reality, as seen by British and Argentine diplomats in 1982, by international economists in Seattle, and in the Balkan mess.  No-one expects the Spanish Inquisition, Srebenica, or the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacreexcept the truly first-rate, like Richard Holbrooke here in the USA or Geoffrey Robertson in Britain.<br />The dyslexic may object that I have been hornswoggled by Holbrooke's and Robertson's purple prose.  The problem is that both write well, in this book and in Richard Holbrooke's recount of the long road to the Dayton peace conference of 1995.  The problem is that writing well is constituted in a conformance to both moral vision and  facts on the ground. <br />The modern international law movement reacts to the recurrence of absolute evil in Europe and Africa in the 1990s, this time unjustified by Communist or free market ideology, and unexplained by Fascist pseudo-ideology.<br />Absolute evil is to the moral imagination the converse of the needs of one's own children to Bertrand Russell.  Despite his skeptical precommittments, Lord Russell said that the needs of kids are something that \\"skepticism does not easily question\\".  Skepticism did not easily process the return, in August 1992, of concentration camps in the former Yugoslavia, and Robertson's response is the deconstruction of absolute national sovereignity.  Skepticism dare not question the redress of crime.<br />One objection, mentioned by Robertson, is that international law, other than a purely naturalistic law based on jus sovereignis, is cultural imperialism.  <br />Cultural imperialism has indeed misapplied norms.  But you cannot apply cultural relativism in an absolute way: this is mere self-contradiction.<br />There is also the objection against a natural law as inconsistent with an open society.  <br />The problem is that unthinking adherence to a natural law in an open society results in a confused expansion of natural law when we tolerantly seek to reconcile views, as to what the practical implications of natural law might actually be.  <br />This resulted in America's \\"Black Hawk Down\\" disaster in Mogadishu in which idealism combined with our Pentagon's vainglorious refusal to serve in a unified command to send  underpowered Rangers into Mogadishu, and the Rangers were rescued by Pakistanis with the sense to serve as part of the rest of the UN.<br />The natural law was you don't let people starve, even when they are far away, and, if bullies are taking the aid you have sent, you send soldiers.  Clinton failed to enforce this because the Pentagon vaingloriously refuses to serve under UN command.<br />The failures of international law in the early 1990s produced, not abstract theories, but hard work like that of QC Robertson, the benefit of which skepticism does not easily question.<br />This included the arrest of General Pinochet.<br />The flaccid skepticism of America's media about Pinochet's guilt does not easily question Robertson's factual recitation of what happened, in the 1970s, to people in Chile.<br />In recent years USA circles have been oppressed with a skeptical cynicism which proclaims the impossibility of securing the good because, don't you know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  <br />This makes it possible for pro-Pinochet American conservatives to easily question the veracity of torture reports, or, failing this, the innocence of the disappeared, or, failing this, the \\"realism\\" of letting philosophy majors scuttle around Santiago, or, failing this, the free-market ideological bona fides of the messenger.  This epistemological curse, of a doubt which is really a bias and a form of intellectual schlamperei, going along to get along with the free market god, is pervasive in American culture.  <br />In Rome we reasoned against the fact that people die when modern states collapse that some future Rusty Calley jest might get nailed.  We like to talk about \\"do-gooders\\" and their ineffectuality when our own ineffectuality was on display in Vietnam and Mogadishu.<br />What we fail to see is the Kantianism that abstract ideals  DO NOT EXIST without acts: but pure acts show a bad will because they are uninformed by a consistent ideal, but were, in Mogadishu, the product of a monstrous \\"will\\" that made the Pentagon an equal partner with the Chief Executive.  <br />Note the laziness, note the sloppiness, note the flaccidity.  <br />For we apply Constitutional \\"separation of powers\\" to the Pentagon which as part of the executive doesn't get power independent of the commander in chief.  <br />QC Robertson's vigorous prose is clearly evidence of a first-class mind sorely absent in American councils of state.  If this is at all indicative of the abilities of people at The Hague, I for one am an American who would welcome those fabled black helicopters.<br />He puts me in mind of the astonishing statement at the beginning of Kant's Metaphysic of Morals, for Kant says the only thing we can know to be good is a good will.<br />On the face of it, this seems to be one of those marvelous-but-false-at-the-critical-point German ideas, like zoos, Zeppelins or the Schlieffen plan: for as we know the road to hell or Srebenica is paved with good intentions.  But upon closer examination, will wills itself into pragmatic daily action, and the road to hell is seen to be paved with action and inaction and not good will.	2002-11-26
US	50358924	R2DD0BFG021ZL9	0393047857	560425342	The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing	Books	5	7	25	N	N	Thanks for this book, Professor Davis	In 1972, during the conflict over \\"who invented the computer\\" I published a letter in ComputerWorld asking why Turing's contributions were being ignored.  However, a letter from a long-haired kid working as a programmer in a small university isn't \\"knowledge\\" properly understood, and therefore I was gratified to get belated confirmation from the eminent Martin Davis.<br />Davis shows that Turing anticipated computation in general with his 1936 paper \\"On the Decision Problem.\\"  But in addition, Turing's work in codebreaking during the war and his postwar work on the Pilot Ace showed a connection between the abstract Turing machine and the computer.<br />Turing's work on the Enigma machine was still under official secrecy in 1972, but I'd seen the Pilot Ace in a collection of papers on computer architecture edited by Bell and Newell.  <br />It still may be open whether Turing invented the computer.  But more important is that a reading of Turing shows that inside computing, there are Two Cultures: \\"engineering\\" versus \\"logic.\\"<br />In 1972, when I wrote my letter, the predominant computing culture was that of von Neumann.  This was the \\"engineering\\" culture.  In this culture software is subordinated as the \\"inferior term\\" of literary theory (using deconstruction, without apology): hardware is \\"male\\" and software is \\"female\\".  <br />Von Neumann was unamused by early programmers who suggested that the computer itself could transliterate mathematical formulae into code.  Von Neumann felt that the computer was too important for such a trivial task.  <br />The early computers were presented as Serious Iron...\\"male.\\"  Most managers in 1972 felt that programming was at best a marginal annoyance.  But in his work on the Pilot Ace, Turing foresaw the need to take programming seriously.<br />To make Serious the marginalized serious is the ultimate marginal gesture, which is why American \\"literary theorists\\" seem to prefer recreational pursuits; Jacques Derrida asked an Americangraduate student to examine technology and she was offended.  It is safer and more respectable to be Serious about Jane Austen.    Like an Austen heroine, who would think of Mr. Napoleon as at best most inconvenient, literary theory seems uninterested in software, yet software provides a rich vein, in my view, of the interaction of the marginal and the Serious.<br />The late, distinguished computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in the 1950s in the Netherlands informed his mentors that he wanted to be, not a mathematician or physicist, but a programmer, which dismayed hiss mentors.  They probably said \\"you can't be serious.\\"<br />Like Glenn Gould, Edward Said, and other intellectuals of the immediate postwar, Dijkstra's negative dialectic seems to have damaged his career somewhat.  Glenn Gould refused to perform after about 1960 with the result that many musical professionals regard Gould, today, as an irritant.  Edward Said refused to reconcile himself to exile and in some circles is scorned.  Dijkstra's choices resulted, I think, in some lack of later recognition: his Turing award was awarded by insiders while his work was of Nobel quality.<br />Turing's contributions as a result of his refusal to conform lifestyle-wise obscured his accomplishment.  <br />The \\"software\\" part of the Two Cultures of computing is partly to blame for its consistent failure, even today, to be heard.  This is because the software Eloi refuse to join world intellectual traditions and disempower themselves.  <br />One example occurs when the software guy must step outside the box into the realm of what Marx would call his relations with his own kind, where \\"all that is solid melts into air.\\"<br />Davis finds Hegel incomprehensible.  But it's possible that there are forms of life external to software in which Hegel makes sense.<br />Hegel identified complete \\"self identity\\" with nothingness.  A software guy's expression would be \\"a brain in a vat\\", coding using pure logic innocent of the dialectic and subsisting on pizza, provided by an employer (who lays our boy off a year later, showing that there is no escape from Hegel's world of lordship and bondage after all.)<br />The predominance of hardware culture has brutalized several generations of programmers.  The hardware view is the source of the ugly phrase \\"a simple matter of programming\\" which encapsulates the irrational subordination of the disfavored term.  In consequence, programmers are held to rigid deadlines in which they have no say.  In consequence, many software efforts including using the computer to build one's own needed tools have become termination offenses.<br />This is a sexual politics.  The irrational \\"business\\" necessity has become the elimination of any need to be conscious of logic as marginal, and the implication is that we can, if need be, do without the marginal term.  But examination of the hardware and its representation either as explicit \\"firmware\\" (programming instructions implementing the hardware in read-only memory) or the result of a process in which the hardware guys had to think like programmers after all.  It is a sexual politics because the irrational demand takes dignity away from the marginal people in the name of a hypostatized rationality in a vat.<br />In part, I identify with the frustration of the engineering manager.  I have heard the phrase \\"a line in the sand\\" more than once in the 1990s where it originated in the senior Bush's campaign to liberate Kuwait (or something.)  The engineering manager, unaware of what Dijkstra called the cruelty of programming considered as applied logic and math, feels that the intellectual content of programming is nil and therefore appeals for more time constitute slacking off.  He needs to set boundaries.<br />The engineering manager feels like Yogi Berra: \\"I would like to go back to college and study but I would not study music because I already like music.\\"  Precisely because of logic's universality (Wittgenstein's \\"allumfassende, weltspiegelnde Logik\\", all-embracing Logic, which mirrors the world) it becomes for the engineering male a form of driving.  We all think we know how to drive because of the universal necessity of driving and it is the other bozo who doesn't know how to drive.  <br />Martin Davis has given programming respectability by linking it to an academic tradition.  This is a start.	2002-11-13
US	50358924	R3568WB86RIRBE	0804739331	176866246	Introduction to Sociology	Books	5	16	24	N	N	Theodore Adorno died for your sins	This book is part of a series of translations by Edmund Jephcott that also includes Adorno's lectures on Kant and ethics.  I have little German but it seems to me that Jephcott knows how to translate, by immersing himself not in static German Kultur (which would be a bad mistake  with regards to Adorno, a victim of bad culture) but by immersing himself in the current events in which Adorno's lecture was contextualized.<br />Now, this book is not what we here in the States would consider an \\"introduction\\" to \\"sociology.\\".  That's because almost anything \\"101\\" is both indoctrination and education.  <br />American social research has defined itself in reaction to Adorno.  While Adorno repeatedly asserted his support for quantitative methods, American social research is based on an exclusionary reversal of the European overemphasis on theory&#133;in which (as Adorno points out in this book) data gathering and moron math replace theory.<br />In terms of the philosophy of science, Adorno's ontology of social research happens to be right.  Physics, unlike sociology, can stand outside the object of research for the very good reason that in physics, the objects of interest are either very small or very far away.<br />Whereas the sociologist studies phenomena which are very large and in the same room.  <br />A physicist could not study black holes while being sucked into a black hole.  A social theorist has to do social research at all times while also being sucked into various social black holes&#133;including Hitler's expulsion of Adorno's kreis in the 1930s.  Furthermore, unlike the physicist's work the sociologist's work immediately and necessarily becomes part of the phenomena.<br />In Godel's proof, the statements that generate Godel's contradiction are outlier cases.  In Heisenberg the self-reflexive phenomenon occurs only at the level of elementary particles.<br />In sociology and in anthropology, however, these phenomena happen all the time.<br />A true introductionto social theory would therefore foreground this ontological issue, but in fact, Sociology for Dummies 101 does not.  <br />Instead, American sociology in reaction to Adorno proclaims the acceptance of \\"methodological individualism\\" as canonical for entry.<br />Methodological individualism is a metaphysic (which justifies itself as pragmatic) which declares that insofar as we're concerned, society can be reduced to individuals following goals.  In this ontology talk about larger elementary structures such as \\"the proletariat\\" on the left or \\"the nation\\" on the right is relegated to \\"dogma.\\"  The reduction to absurdity is the gnomic utterance of the mad woman Margaret Thatcher: \\"there is no such thing as society.\\"<br />It is indeed nonsense to speak of hypostatized entities such as \\"the proletariat\\" or \\"the nation\\" as if they could exist apart from the interests of their actual members.  Part of the metaphysical puzzle of nuclear war was the insanity, on the part of Soviet leaders, in believing that by killing 90% of the proletariat they could ensure the victory of the proletariat: yet indirectly, the hypostatizing thought of Stalinism generates this insane ontology.<br />The reverse insanity is to even attempt to make sensible conclusions about society from a mass of data...and, as needed, confuse images of reality with elementary \\"facts.\\"  Its size is a practical problem which means that no justification is available from American pragmatism, the epistemology which underlies methodological individualism and this means that methodological individualism contradicts itself...it doesn't work.  <br />But the real problem is Godelian/Heisenbergian as seen in the large American industry of SAT test preparation, resume writing, and corporate grab-ass.  It is that methodological individualism scales up from individual observations that are gamed by ordinary slobs, who don't like to be treated as lab rats, and who in many cases are temporary, paid employees of firms, who allow themselves to be objectified for a fistful of dollars and free chow.  <br />Adorno presents a foundational solution based on Kant.<br />Suppose, examining the simultaneous existence of individual choice and the emergence of larger structures including that structure visible (in an example of Adorno's) when one is unable to borrow money or get a job, we were to say that this analysis, which acknowledges the existence of BOTH individual choice AND larger structures, neither of which would exist without the other.  [I have of course, just reinvented the intellectual foundations of European Social Democracy.]<br />This resembles Kant because this surrender was part of the Kantian method.  In ontology it is the admission that while we cannot know the world as such in the way we demand, there is nonetheless a difference between dream and reality, a transcendental difference established by the benign circularity of an argument which shows that the existence of a distinction is presupposed as a condition of knowledge, and thus argument, itself.<br />In American-ese, I can well imagine Adorno saying \\"sure, my Frankfurt school is part of society and it plays the game.  My guy Horkheimer concealed its Marxism when we were in California during the McCarthy era because we like to eat.  But I deny that this falsifies our conclusions as self-interested.  This is because individuals and their individual institutions NECESSARILY exist alone with ALL OTHER individuals and institutions as part of a society which WOULD NOT EXIST without at least two individuals talking to each other.\\"<br />\\"You can't say that this cheerful admission of being part of society falsifies what we say. This is because the economics that results from individualist sociology proclaims self-interest as paramount.  This places the apologists for methodological individualism and a dogma which dares not speak its name under the logically identical cloud of suspicion...which works both ways.  Now get out of my office.\\"<br />The most moving part of the book is the end, for Godde and Jephcott have preserved the audience's hissing when Adorno defends another academic's right to speak.  He was probably hissed by clowns who are now senior executives at Deutsches Bank and Springer, who unlearned left politics but retained the ability to use methodological discourtesy (and left sexism) as a tactical tool and used it in the corporate climb.  <br />Theodore Adorno (two years after these lectures) died from the stresses of 1968.	2002-11-12

Baxter was about the only high-ranking figure to preserve any sense that Enron's monkeyshines were unethical.  His suicide has not been fully resolved to be indeed a suicide and, as the authors of this book point out, the note is in block letters.<br />Block letters MAY have been used to conceal something darker and about the same time they were used by the Anthrax mailer.  I do not mean to imply anything unprovable.  That's because I am well aware that at a certain level we despair of getting at the truth about the behavior of people with power, from OJ Simpson to the JFK assassination.<br />But what is in plain view is a breakdown in trust.<br />The ability of Enron to construct a financial fantasy, in which debt was off-loaded to new entities constructed at light speed, is not something that could be done with manual technology, or implemented by lower-level and midlevel personnel with job security.<br />Starting with OMB director David Stockman's use of a primitive facility of the first spreadsheet (Visicalc) to present a \\"balanced\\" budget to President Reagan which then deprived social and welfare agencies of funding in midyear, automated technology has enabled the transformation of accounting into literature.  <br />Unfortunately, what was produced was not odes or haikus.  Instead, people with 401Ks during the Nineties actually believed their future to be secure for a change, only to find themselves the victims of a fictional narrative.  This is because the degringolade happens quite fast, in modern systems, in reverse.<br />This book shows the dangers of the \\"employment at will\\" doctrine.<br />In the 1980s during the first wave of downsizing, metro newspapers had a large number of ads from law firms promising redress in case of termination.  These ads have disappeared because the appeals bar, in the 1990s, rescusitated the old doctrine that the law is not interested in an unfair termination, except in cases of racial discrimination...with age discrimination gradually falling from favor as realistically actionable.<br />One member of the Federal bench, Richard Posner, wrote an essay around this time in defense of employment at will and in response to a legal scholar's attempt to show that a less arm's length relationship made for stronger families and communities.  One gets the sense from most of Posner's writings that, quite over the heads of the ordinary people at Enron, a sort of Euro style *KulturKampf* was being conducted.<br />By the time of Enron's hey-day, termination could not be questioned and was a managed process at most companies.  Books about how to handle termination described the employee, not as potentially just mad as hell but as \\"distraught.\\"<br />The feminized term implied genteel handling.<br />At Enron, intelligence was coded into a form of brutal shrewdness.  People below the level of Baxter who maintained any sense of good practice apart from the bottom line were coded by the performance rating system as rather stupid and eased out.<br />Of course, this coding, which was the norm at most growth companies, MEANT that people at all levels did what they were told.<br />This is in spite of the fact that an old accounting principle happens to be one's ability to explain one's tax deductions or annual report to a neutral man-in-the-street.  Enron's CPAs and network admins were, in addition to being employees, men in the street yet were expected to toe the mark.  <br />The result has been a recession now known to be double-dip (and the number and depths of the dips is not a known quantity.)  The boom was fueled by a trust that was erased.<br />This Humpty Dumpty will not, I am afraid to say, be brought back by exhortations to play nice in any system where the rewards for playing dirty exist and where ordinary people are terrorized by employment at will.<br />When I was in school, ordinary students were proud to be accounting majors or even majors in data processing.  Some of them actually felt that their hard work would welcome them into a demi-priesthood in which they could opt out of megasuccess in favor of a more sheltered life.  They felt that their expertise was both technical and an adherence to standards.<br />In accounting, this was the refusal to record income that wasn't received.  In data processing this was, in the 1970s, a \\"stuctured programming\\" movement that declared that a rigourous approach to merely writing instructions to a computer was better because a truthful result occured.<br />But as seen in this book and a recent series on Arthur Anderson in the Chicago Tribune, enthusiastic loyalty to internal professional standards was coded in the 1980s and 1990s as being a speed bump on the road to mega-profits.  <br />The result is that the in-crowd members cower in their trophy homes waiting for summons in the mail and the ordinary slob is looking for work in companies that cannot fund new hires.  The country as a whole slides towards an unprecedented event in our history (a war of aggression) in preference to a serious moral inventory, which is instead recommended only to individual losers of the struggle.<br />Some of us have a bad habit of wanting to be informed and the authors of this collection do us an excellent service.	2002-09-07
US	50358924	R37EO5AQOC0K2K	0393041301	59999978	World Poetry: An Anthology of Verse from Antiquity to Our Time	Books	4	4	20	N	N	One (minor?) objection	I noticed, in this mostly excellent anthology of world poetry, that a single word, \\"weird\\" has been spelled incorrectly as \\"wierd.\\"<br />This would be unmentionably minor.  However, the misspelling is in a translation of the old English poem The Wanderer.<br />\\"Weird\\" (spelled something like wyrd in the original, perhaps) is the single most important word in the entire poem.  This is because the Wanderer himself, the speaker of the poem, is \\"weird\\", \\"set apart in thought.\\"<br />Today, the word refers to oddballs.  But it appears that in old English the word referred to a man's soul, his \\"wyrd.\\"  \\"Weird\\" may have meant \\"great of soul\\" and, perhaps, able to reflect as does The Wanderer on a long life.<br />Today, a society that is unconsciously other-directed does not encourage the chap who does this and instead we are supposed to get direction from our mates.  <br />Therefore, it is possible that collectively and as a group (where lowest common denominators tend to emerge) the editors were tone-deaf to the word, and the need to preserve its exceptional spelling (which modern dictionaries confirm.)<br />The editors, in a world-multicultural spirit, may have thought that the word, \\"weird\\" needed to conform to a generally-accepted, trumping rule of modern English orthography whose relative antiquity is shown by its rhyme: \\"i before e, except after c.\\"<br />In so doing, they exhibit how a group of people, anxious to be be Politically Correct, are more apt in the French fashion to be dirigiste, and to make and to follow abstract, general rules.  This *mission civilisatrice* is considered in such circles somewhat superior to a system, whether of law, or orthography, with many exceptions...as found in English spelling, or on those English and American juries permitted, in increasingly rare circumstances, to show mercy or severity, and ignore the black letter of the law.<br />Now, I have no brief against Political Correctness.  I have seen first-hand (as a minor participantin its enforcement on a network at Princeton) how it spares feelings previously violated and gives voice to the voiceless.<br />But all social systems have besetting sins.  The besetting sin of the older systems was the prime of place given to dead, white males.  <br />The besetting sin of the modern system is that the lowest common denominator, here, the tone-deafness, is silently given equal time to an older sensitivity to the music of the Wanderer. <br />Many neo-conservative conscientious objectors to Political Correctness may be not so much paleo-conservative as anxious about the position of the indvidual author and reader in a *dirigiste* system, in which abstract rules trump local custom.  Paradoxically, one of the goals of Political Correctness happens to be respect for local custom.<br />I am reminded in far more serious venues of how the feminist critique of the use of sex as power becomes, in the corporation and the academe, the syntactical and relatively mindless application of rules.  The feminist narrates how a woman has a right to a job free of unwanted advances, even by future justices of the Supreme Court.  The narrative becomes a rule in which the very mention of our sexual being becomes a terminating offense.<br />And in the same way, a marvelous exception to a rule that's hard enough to remember in itself, an exception self-reflexively weird and an echo of ancient times, becomes barbarously forgotten.<br />Where is the horse?  Where is the rider?  Where is my car?	2002-05-16
US	50358924	RYF58P9RS1BN1	1893115267	548628279	Visual Basic .NET and the .NET Platform: An Advanced Guide	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Great advanced resource	I read this book as an experienced Visual Basic programmer (3..6) who also, prior to reading Troelsen, had used the Beta releases (1..2) for about eight months.<br />I found Andrew's book useful, well-written, and illuminating on all the core topics.  I use it as a reference in place of the Microsoft CD.<br />The Microsoft documentation is also excellent.  However, we need authors like Andrew.  This is because as independent parties they provide assurance that a given feature will work.<br />Experienced developers often &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; because of an epistemological problem with manufacturer documentation.  This is because they know that the manufacturer will put the best possible spin on available resources and recommend the use of features which do not fully perform as advertised.<br />This militiates against getting full value from a product such as Visual Basic .Net, which provides many tools such as serialization which remove, in the case of serialization, the need to write code to convert objects to and from XML (Andrew describes this feature in particular.)<br />Developers don't &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; out of vanity although in our culture, a Puritan strain means that the developer who successfully does so is at times accused of being vainglorious.  Developers reinvent the wheel in most cases to perform their jobs.  A book like this is therefore worth its purchase price since it provides a way for the experienced developer to see by example that given functionality actually works.<br />About the only objection is Mr. Troelsen's code example, which is a well-written but sterile cars application.  My personal preference happens to be more encapsulated solutions that can be dropped into my code as DLLs.<br />For example, I'd consider, in presenting serialization, &quot;wrapping&quot; the functionality into two Shared functions, object2XML and xml2Object.  I acknowledge of course that this ignores binary serialization and is based on a personal preference for XML.  The bottom line is that the method thereby is available either as cut and paste (as it is in Troelsen) or as something that can be used immediately.<br />However, in the MIS and VB book market place it appears that the bias is to present, as does Mr. Troelsen, code as cut and paste.  My personal preference happens to be for the style that is found in Numerical Recipes.<br />This is a minor issue with an excellent book.	2002-05-07

And thanks to the nasty ideological campaign against language of which the Judge is a part, both the Times of London and the New York Times had graceless obituaries for Derrida, which dismissed him as French, and verbose, and marginal.<br /><br />This year, the leadership here in China authorized a translation of this appalling book and may have used it to justify a campaign against that micro Public Intellectual the blogger, who has the bad taste to misspend his leisure as Marx's critic of an evening if cattle rustler by day.<br /><br />I do wonder if Posner takes satisfaction in this.<br /><br />Posner is on record as disliking the very phrase Truth to Power. It is unlikely I shall ever be dragged into his court room for the very good reason that Appellate court judges abuse their clerks and cancel awards to widows and orphans in chamber and not in a courtroom. But if I am I hope to remember the words of the old play in which King Henry IV Part One does not wish to hear the word Mortimer, and change them apropos:<br /><br />\\"Nay, I will; that's flat:<br />He said he would not ransom Truth to Power;<br />Forbad my tongue to speak of 'Truth to Power';<br />But I will find him when he lies asleep,<br />And in his ear I'll holla 'Truth to Power!'<br />Nay,<br />I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak<br />Nothing but 'Truth to Power,' and give it him<br />To keep his anger still in motion.\\"<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />This book is deep nonsense, because it assumes without argument that public intellectuals participate in a \\"market.\\"<br /><br />The problem is that effective public intellectuals don't produce what Posner thinks they produce.<br /><br />The public intellectual's publisher, and not the public intellectual, produces the commodity, that more or less corresponds to the activity of the public intellectual.<br /><br />*Qua* public intellectual, George Orwell was an effective contributor to a conversation in which it was found that Stalinism and other forms of totalitarianism are dead ends.  It was his publisher that took his writings and made them into a saleable product.<br /><br />However, Posner has made it clear in other books that he believes we all participate in a hypostatized Market, and can and should be judged based on Market criteria.  His Market replaces outdated ideologies like the dictatorship of the proletariat, while refusing to admit that it is indeed another ideology.<br /><br />The problem is that if the \\"marketplace of ideas\\" is infinite in all directions, consisting of individual producers individually evaluated by atomized consumers, there is literally no way of telling whether the ideas, so marketed, are true or false.<br /><br />The phenomenon is apparent on the Internet; for in place of a libertarian fantasy-land, in which truth appears because all contributors are equal, and none of them receives special consideration because he represents an institution or a public intellectual, we have an almost daemonic world in which falsity is given equal credence with truth.<br /><br />Thus on the contemporary Internet, a 15-year-old kid who knows nothing about the law is prized as a legal authority because of the very structure of the Internet.  This structure provides no way of mapping authorities such that their views are certified by linkage to an authority outside cyberspace.<br /><br />Cass Sunstein has described this problem as that of the \\"discourse cascade\\" where entire zones of the Internet are dedicate to false propositions such as the importance of the Second Amendment.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Posner would destroy the institution of the public intellectual by treating the public intellectual as an employee who is found wanting in terms of a hypostatized Productivity of trueand verifiable (or not falsifiable, within a time frame Posner gets to specify) ideas.<br /><br />This is deeply dishonest, for Posner is concerned with deconstructing a priesthood.  The problem is that nature abhors a vacuum, and into the vacuum created by the absence of public intellectuals, rushes people like Posner who are public intellectuals, malgre lui.<br /><br />What Posner misses is that public intellectuals are not entrepreneurs producing a mousetrap.  Instead, they are participants in a conversation such that it is completely meaningless to rate their output.<br /><br />And note that despite Posner's faith in the Market, he mistrusts the real market.  For example, he probably thinks Adorno is nonsense, for Theodore Adorno was a Frankfurt School Marxist.  Nonetheless, the real market, in the form of computers at Borders and Barnes and Noble, keeps on putting the gloomy Tedster on the shelves, to be pawed by the grubby hands of us ordinary slobs, who are unconvinced that we live in the best of all possible worlds under the market.<br /><br />Here Posner replicates an intellectual's mistake, which is to find fault with the decisions of the real market, whether in the name of what the intellectual thinks Marx said, or, in the contemporary scene, what Milton Friedman and Sir Karl Popper said.  For in a fashion reminiscent of Turing, and Godel, the real market keeps its own deconstruction in print.<br /><br />Posner is mobilizing resentment against people perceived to be media figures and, since the ordinary educated person does not regard them as real, these public intellectuals can be targets of resentment.  When I worked at Princeton, I would occasionally encounter the public intellectual Cornel West, walking down Prospect towards William Street on my lunch break.<br /><br />Cornel was most engaging and approachable, and reading his output I view him less as a scientist making isolated predictions, than a man engaged in conversation with the past, and with issues of the present day.<br /><br />It is to me therefore ill-spirited to REDUCE Cornel, or anyone else, to a set of verifiable or falsifiable tokens printed in books,  and it is productive, in right-wing, mass media venues, of a new and very nasty phenomenon.<br /><br />This is the public intellectual *maudit*, like Anne Coulter, who when bested in debate makes physical threats, which can neither be verified nor falsified, conveniently enough.  In Coulter's case, this is recommending that we invade Islamic countries and convert their populations to Christianity at the point of a gun.<br /><br />Note that IF we adopt Posner's programme, of submitting public intellectuals to a sort of performance evaluation (to which, I should note, tenured Federal judges are not subject) this will produce precisely that form of public intellectual we deserve; the public intellectual who games the system to win and is unconcerned with truth.<br /><br />On the left, this produces Stalinists.  On the right, this produces Fascists.<br /><br />There is something Soviet, Latin American, or mediaeval, about a member of the Federal bench writing books about intellectuals, obstreperous priests, and felonious monks.

That is: in &quot;a And b&quot;, &quot;b&quot; IS evaluated as of beta 2 when &quot;a&quot; is False, although there is no reason for doing so; the False value of a fully determines &quot;a And b&quot; to be False.<br />Likewise, in Beta 2's &quot;a Or b&quot;, &quot;b&quot; IS evaluated as of beta 2 when a is False, although there is similarly no reason for doing so; the True value of &quot;b&quot; fully determines &quot;a Or b&quot; to be True, no matter what.<br />This book also omits mention of two new replacements for And and for Or, AndAlso and OrElse, available as of Beta 2 and, I believe, in future versions.  Both of these operators short-circuit: for example, in &quot;a AndAlso b&quot;, b is not evaluated when a is false.<br />This is a very important issue, because in all examples, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; may not be simple variables.  Instead they may be expressions which call user functions.  These functions may have hundreds of side-effects in that they may change persistent disk data and many variables in the program.<br />For example, consider &quot;IsNumeric(a) And a &gt; writeTestRecord&quot; versus &quot;IsNumeric(a) AndAlso a &gt; writeTestRecord&quot; where writeTestRecord changes the data base and returns the count of records written.<br />These examples are not contrived; in the real world they occur frequently.<br />Visual Basic 6 and before was in the tradition of Wirth's Pascal language, which did not short-circuit, for two apparent reasons: it is easier to emit code for a simple interpreter when short-circuiting is not in effect, and, probably, Wirth felt that avoiding short-circuiting would avoid a confusing and hard to explain situation, and thereby avoid bugs.<br />However, languages like C and Cobol have used short-circuiting for their logical operators without too many problems, and short-circuiting is both more efficient and has a tendency to avoid deeply nested code.<br />This book was not stamped &quot;Beta 2&quot; but it was published in August 2001 when beta 2 was the current release of VB.Net, and the book states that the latest release is indeed beta 2.

For it was in Burma that the British found themselves engaged in an anticolonialist struggle against Japan's brand of colonialism, without meaning to do much more than protect India.  Why it was necessary to protect India was apparently forgotten, and indeed, the British presence in the Middle East in the immediate post-war period was in order to ensure coaling and oiling stations for ships traveling to dear old India, and, as I have said, nobody really knew why it was necessary to go to the coral strand, apart from the central heating issue back home.<br />The British empire was an Enchanted Glass that was still in existence when I was an American lad which had quite outlived its usefulness, and Fraser served its last moments of military semi-glory in the war.  ...<br />George MacDonald Fraser is a curious case.  As a writer he is far more talented than many writers who've gone on to commercial success and Hollywood, yet Fraser's audience seems limited to fans.  He does not seem to go beyond a certain point.<br />I believe this is because Fraser expresses an \\"English-ness\\" with which many actual Englishmen are uncomfortable.  His stories are informed by a sort of irony that was perhaps perfected in the British middle and upper classes between the wars as a result of the horrific experiences of what is still known, in Britain, as the Great War.  <br />This is an essentially subaltern irony that speaks truth to power and which manages to display a consciousness ultimately at variance with dominant paradigms.  Rather than reinforcing the military and industrial disciplines which were expressed in the treatment of Royal Navy other ranks during the conflict with Napoleon, like Patrick O'Brien, Fraser's characters go with the flow, as we Americans say, with an eye for the main chance.  <br />Thus Fraser is quite comfortable to recount, in detail, just how and why the ordinary British soldier voted Churchill out in '45, and the extraordinarily decent and humane Clement Attlee, in.<br />Every so often in our republic and Britain, the electorate acts in its own interests.  ...  <br /> Fraser's British soldiers elected a Labor pol in '45 because while Winston was quite useful for frightening the Germans, he'd established beyond a doubt in the interwar period that he was completely incompetent at domestic affairs, the economy, and the concerns of the Missus back home about the drains.  <br />The average ranker may not have known that Winston returned England to the gold standard in '25, one of the stupidest moves ever made in the UK's economic policy and one that caused a general strike a few years on.  But he knew that Winston had been forced to \\"wander in the wilderness\\" in the 1930s for a [dang] good reason, and not as part of any hero's journey.  Winston had been forced into Sheol because he was a hazard to life and limb.<br />I realize that we Americans are supposed to idolize Churchill, but there are quite enough admirable Britons, George MacDonald Fraser among them, who deserve a ten-foot high statue in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, far more than Lady Thatcher (don't get me started.)	2002-02-22
US	50358924	R2JFFWXNNR00RF	0815701071	462389866	Bush v. Gore: The Court Cases and the Commentary	Books	3	6	29	N	N	Balancing the irreconcilable, justifying the unjustifiable	The Brookings Institution is a rabbit warren of liberals raised for food, who are, it seems, preserved so that the elite can think well of themselves; Nixon contemplated fire-bombing the joint, and ever since its denizens have been somewhat cautious.  For some time, neoconservatism has been the real political philosophy of the elites of The Beltway and Manhattan, but for purposes of public relations the pretense is made that we would be liberal if we could, were it not for dose foreign terrorists and dem welfare queens who take advantage of us.<br />My experience from Eastern academia and elsewhere is that in actuality liberals in our society tread a narrow path and must avoid giving offense to what William Jennings Bryan called, and which remains, the dollar power.<br />One way in which they do this is by being &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;balanced.&quot;  Now to some diehard liberals, such as John Rawls, fairness is being just to the least well-off, and is constituted in such deeds as slipping the local wino the contents of the poor-box.  However, fairness has been redefined in recent years by neoconservative pressure as &quot;balance.&quot;  <br />Thus Bush v Gore, rather than presenting ONLY E. J. Dionne's liberal, pro-Gore viewpoint, presents (1) the text of all relevant court cases and (2) a balanced selection of views from liberals and conservatives.<br />The problem is that there really is no common ground.  <br />The case for Bush, it is obvious from this book, is incoherent, wrong, and based on force majeure and Gore won the election by the generally accepted standards of modern democracy, which are on record in the United Nations' founding documents and which the US has helped to enforce in Haiti and elsewhere...but not in Florida last year.<br />Scalia's majority opinion of Dec 12 is incoherent because it has to maintain, against the entire trend of American history, that we really are a Roman republic, in which the vast majority of people have a limited choice of top man every year by grace and favor of successful used-car salesmen; for Scalia leans heavily on his claim that we, the people, are dependent upon the grace and favor of the moneyed bozos in our STATE legislatures for our right to vote.<br />In this Animal House model the country is run as a toga party by George Bush's fraternity brothers; I mention the Belushi film advisedly because these films manufacture consent to the superior wisdom of dyslexic clowns.  <br />But this model is not Rome, it is at best, Byzantine.  In this model our elections become like the ability of the citizens of Byzantium to root for sports teams named after primary colors; a meaningless diversion.  Indeed, and as Chomsky has suggested, the programs of the Democratic and Republican candidates are so close together that random numbers may determine how we vote, there being no strong arguments or differences presented, and this, to Chomsky would naturally bias the results toward close ties, with the result that Bush v. Gore was not a fluke; the problem may recur as long as candidates do not present clear alternatives.<br />The Roman republic was maintained by the collective ability of the Romans prior to Octavius Caesar to maintain, over and above personal appetite, a distinctly Roman legal culture.  The Roman stance was that of a Brutus (not the one who killed Caesar but an earlier Brutus) who allowed his sons to be killed rather than violate the Roman Republic's law.  The theme was sacrifice of personal advantage to the commons.<br />The early Brutus manifested republican integrity because he was willing to sacrifice his sons to abstract legal principles.  It might seem that the later Brutus had the same integrity (and a superficial reading of the Shakespeare play would indicate that this is so): but Shakespeare ultimately makes Plutarch's point that murder had no place in republican Rome and that Brutus' form of integrity was actually a form of corruption.  Brutus and Cassius, after all, violated their own laws by killing Caesar and their rebellion was morally and legally equivalent to that of Spartacus.<br />The last time republican integrity was celebrated in popular political culture in France and America was not a conservative time at all.  It was instead the revolutionary climate of France in 1789, and, to a lesser extent, in America of 1776.  The paintings of Jacques-Louis David and Benjamin West celebrated a political willingness to sacrifice bourgeois interest for the greater good.  They state visually that if we want a res publica we need men like Marat, General Wolfe dying on the Plains of Abraham, and Brutus catching hell from his old lady for his sacrifice of his sons.<br />Now, nothing further from modern conservatism could be imagined, which demands that people NOT be made to sacrifice for the greater good of the Republic, or the Revolution.  No, in modern conservatism, lesser folk only sacrifice for dear old Enron...not the republic.  And the top men are never discommoded at all.<br />The game is so deeply cynical that many honest American voters are completely unaware of what's being done to them.  Liberals who've run &quot;focus groups&quot; to study the opinions of voters have found that many voters are not aware of how far to the right the in-group Republicans have drifted and the minimalism of their commitment to representative government.  The Brookings Institution has dropped the ball, for its &quot;balance&quot; and its retainer of Bill Kristol shows institutional cowardice in which the FACT that the election was a bloodless coup d'etat becomes a meaningless opinion.	2002-01-13
US	50358924	R53VZPSX9GFB2	1565923561	112251502	Developing Windows Error Messages: Error Messages that Communicate	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Still useful but contains certain aporias	Ben's book is well-written and well-edited and provides a number of useful ideas on how to write effective error handlers and error messages in the Windows environment.  It's focus may seem strange to nonprogrammers, but programmers appreciate this sort of guidance on details.<br />However, Ben does repeat some saws or maxims which need to be deconstructed.  <br />One is that at one time, error messages were overly terse because &quot;there was not enough storage&quot; to make them useful.  <br />I find this disingenuous, because the dreamtime to which Ben is referring to is probably the early 1980s.  In the early 1980s, I was as a former IBM 1401 programmer (whose first machine ten years prior had 8000 characters of storage) in awe of the possibilities of the primitive disk and tape systems then available.<br />On the 1401 I had developed a system which used an &quot;overlay&quot; and a supplemental manual procedure to provide a user with fully expounded error messages in English, and by the early 1980s, providing my users with English error messages was not a problem.<br />The idea that at any time &quot;we are limited by the gear available&quot; is to me a confession that a certain need is not important enough to warrant our time.  Basically, the need of users for error messages has always been triaged and continues to be triaged in an unconscious binary opposition between the &quot;serious&quot; and MALE tasks of programming, and the &quot;not serious&quot; FEMALE task of communication.  To me the first mistake was to divide these tasks.<br />Another old saw Ben repeats is that &quot;programmers&quot;, in inverse proportion to their skill level or interest in being &quot;programmers&quot; do not like to write, or cannot write.  <br />This saw exists in a logical dependence on an idea from outside programming which is that there is such a thing as a content-free &quot;skill in communication&quot;.  Although a convenient corporate reification, useful for example in getting rid of racial minorities, women, and older employees on the basis that they are mistreated because of a generalized lack of &quot;communications skills&quot;, the very idea that we can speak of communication without discussing content, or for that matter simple morality, is nonsense.<br />&quot;Poor communicator&quot; may be a true generalization as applied to the actual population of programmers in the United States.  However, it is belied by a maxim of hero computer scientist Edsger Dijsktra, which is that programming ability is indicated by command of the language.  <br />To the extent that programmers write overly terse error messages they may actually be, while statistically representative of American programmers considered highly qualified, less well-qualified than they could be.<br />This is because the only evidence we have that the programmer understands his system is something outside code.  <br />Ben Ezzell himself shows he's qualified by not only writing good examples of error messages but also by being aware of what the user probably needs.  He does so as a programmer who can code, and it is a false humility of his to say that programming skill has nothing to do with communications skill.<br />Managers love to give programmers books such as Who Moved my Cheese? and The Elements of Style, probably because these books rigorously exclude the content of the programmer's work from consideration.  This may be useful in some cases but basically it is an attempt to deprofessionalize, for it denies that the programmer has learned anything worthwhile.<br />The managerial saw is that by definition &quot;mere programmers&quot; do not know enough to communicate with users and require by definition an interface consisting of people who do things like review, or actually compose, error messages.  But inside the corporation, resources are allocated by non-market means despite the commitment to the free market, and the practical result is that most corporate employees seek first to avoid blame and are therefore not likely to compose forceful and hard-hitting error messages because in the corporation, the messenger is killed for bad news.<br />I am not dismissing the need for people to perhaps specialise in technical writing or even the composition of error messages...especially for international systems.  It would almost be too much to expect programmers to know multiple human languages.  What I don't like is the ideology implicit in saying that we must cultivate a content free communications style.  I like Ben's book because it is ABOUT both programming and communicating.<br />The genuine quality of this book, together with its genuine aporias, indicates a need for a definition, outside corporate hegemony, of programming.  This definition is needed because if programming is implicitly defined ONLY as MIS programming, it becomes impossible to develop effective systems for the public good...as evidenced by the real problems government and not for profits have in implementing systems; because of omnipresent cost considerations, many such organizations are forced to use off-the-shelf packages which encapsulate (at a deep level) assumptions valid only for private, for profit businesses in what are called &quot;business rules.&quot;<br />A critical theory would define programming, not just writing error messages or documentation, as writing and not mathematical, while at the same time realizing that many practitioners seriously underestimate the applied mathematics of programming.  In the present arrangements in the US, programming is considered mathematical and numerical in some sense, thereby excluding many people who could make a contribution, while in another sense, any form of real mathematics and real logic is excluded at the critical point in the development of many systems, usually when cost constraints can be used to justify hand-waving.  <br />If I understood what Claude Levi-Strauss was talking about in expoundinga way to read a myth against its own grain rather than literally, I would be able to conclude that American programming praxis is a form of systematically misreading an Enlightenment myth.  This would help me to understand why such genuine talent and ability such as Ben's is on display in books from publishers like O'Reilly whereas in practice error messages STILL confuse genuine end users.	2001-12-09

British politics is a refreshing break from American politics. Today, as Peter Hennessy relates, Parliament is indeed a bear garden, but it is a garden of literate and witty bears, and not the merely ursine Trent Lott and Phil Gramm.<br />The unwritten British Constitution is an \\"oral\\" Constitution. As Tom Nairn has shown (in The Enchanted Glass) there is, for this reason, a dreamlike quality about procedures, and even a childlike autism shown in the interface of Number 10 and the Queen, wherein a great store is laid upon special boxes of magic papers.<br />It used to be endearing. However, as Tom Nairn and Norman Davies (The Isles) show, the unwritten British Constitution did not in actuality evolve time out of mind but instead in 1688 where it appears that the ruling elites of the Isles discovered a way of getting along with each other that involved carefully following norms, and strongly agreeng upon negative propositions, especially what sort of fellows did NOT constitute a proper player of the political game.<br />As a result, the boundaries of the British political system seem firm and unyielding to its participants and to American tourists; indeed the attraction to a certain sort of American mind is the attraction of what seems to be a closed system, \\"little England\\", free of French influenza or the clamor of competing interests here in the States.<br />But precisely as a result of the supposed unwritten nature of the British basic law, the boundaries do have a tendency to shift in an unseen (because undiscussed) way, much like North Carolina's Outer Banks, or the Fen Country.<br />Seismic changes occur in the British system in fits of absent-mindedness and are neither discussed nor properly recorded. For example, contrast the fact that in the period starting with the First World War and ending about 1990 with the Charles/Diana divorce.<br />In this period, Republicanism was unmentionable and Britons acted as if the constitutional Monarch was undiscussable and not replaceable, which (as Nairn shows) silenced a healthy 19th century British Republican tradition, in recent years under discussion again because of the savage treatment of Diana Spencer by the media.<br />Far more seriously and as Hennessy documents, the rules of the game have a tendency to change drastically as a result of the personal style of PMs. The signal case is that of Margaret Thatcher.<br />Systematically over-estimating her actual intellectual capabilities in the manner of the mid-level scientific worker Lady Thatcher showed that by giving deliberate offense, one could secure short-term advantage among the clubbable. That is, she entered a system dominated by upper-class males like Ted Heath whose combination of male chauvinism and chivalry had no way of dealing with simple lack of courtesy, amplified by media thugs.<br />In the 1980s, the worst sort of bounderism flowed unchecked through a channel dug by the 1979 winter of discontent. As an American observer I am forced to use British words coined in the pre-war years to describe strivers who take unfair advantage, and it seems that Thatcher opened a sort of bounder sluiceway through which previously checked energies (some benign and some malign) flowed into British life. This bounderism thought rather highly of itself as opposed to lazy sods in trade unions and Cambridge Apostles in MI5. But it seems to have been best at destruction, and Thatcher's own exclusion from public life in 1990 was, as Hennessy shows, payback by an Establishment that she \\"saved\\"...from any sort of nonsense including democracy, economic and political.<br />Hennessy's introductory chapters show that under George III the Prime Minister was truly only first among equals, not even able in some cases to sack other ministers. Perhaps this is the origin of the attractive tendency of the greatest to try to work as team members; their authority was never confirmed. This was by 1980 a power vacuum which Thatcher merely exploited. Inlight of her silly aphorisms (such as \\"there is no such thing as society\\") Margaret Thatcher was intellectually underqualified but introduced an era in which underqualified men and women (including John Major, Reagan, Blair, and both the elder and younger Bush) have been given a special pass if their ideology is conservative, whereas the truly qualified (Blair, Clinton, and Sen. McCain) achieve genuine results in the teeth of a drumbeat of opposition.<br />Characteristic of this opposition is the way it marshals false promises and true miseries among outsiders without, of course, letting them into the corridors of power. For example, it is absolutely astonishing here in the States that both Bushes have been able to steal formerly Democratic voters, because the policies of both create such misery among the rural white underclass. Thatcher coupled an unjustified pride in her own degree in sciences with a paradoxical contempt for university trained specialists who did not toe her party line, and appealed over their heads to a populace excluded from higher education by the class system. Thatcher replaced genuine bottom-up institutions such as the Greater London Council with a government of statistics and numerical objectives easily fudged by insiders, and unexplained to outsiders, which Blair has preserved. <br />The Most Tony has achieved his success only by transforming the PM into a sort of Presidential office, and he did so because he's aware that the New Tories will act like Thatcher to forestall a more gentlemanly regime, using media leaks, gossip and whatever else comes to mind including perhaps the Mace, to thwack the opposition upside the head. Number 10 has become the Beltway. <br />Unmentioned in this is the serious devolution of any ability for a British subject or American citizen to participate meaningfully in political affairs WITHOUT being coded as some sort of nut. Writers like Hennessy and observers of the Beltway are fond of describing, in a sort ofinsider's way, Inner Rings of power. These Inner Rings are naturalized. But the fact of their existence only means one thing to the ordinary slob; an increasing lack of access to the formulation of policy.	2001-12-06

We have no name for a phenomenon that is useful to our cultural life, and &quot;American-centric&quot; is therefore my term of art for books that narrate culture and technology as if no interesting developments happen beyond our shores.  The consequences of this ignorance, as we have seen, can be deadly, for one of the reasons for non-Western extremism is our instinct to treat non-Western participation in our culture and technology with disdain.<br />Thus, as Ceruzzi fails to narrate, Algol is really the only common ancestor of usable programming languages, yet Ceruzzi dismisses Algol because it was not a commercial success.  Algol was not a commercial success because IBM failed to support it in the decade from 1954 to 1964, and then attempted to usurp it with vaporware PL/I, for which IBM's programmers failed to develop an adequate compiler until the mid-1970s.  Nonetheless, the block structure of Algol was found to be the only rational way of thinking about program structure as opposed to Fortran.<br />But Ceruzzi not only naturalizes American technical praxis along the dimensions of geography, he also naturalizes it along a temporal axis in which the mainframe era was a failed try at modern praxis.<br />Thus the &quot;colorful&quot; Herb Grosch does get his picture in Ceruzzi's book...and with his goatee poor Herb looks slightly fraudulent.<br />Grosch's law was so obviously self-serving from the standpoint of Herb's employer IBM; it was that the larger the computer, the power delivered increases exponentially.  Herb left IBM in the late 1960s, and the history of how men like Herb were compromised (by the occlusion of their feelings and thoughts with corporate goals) is unwritten.<br />Herb's law was falsified by the discovery in the late 1960s that large computers (such as MIT's Multics) required such complex software that their promise could not be delivered, and today's law is Moore's law, which declares thatmicrochip power will instead exponentially increase as the micros get smaller.  <br />Common to both &quot;laws&quot; is the naturalizing error of neoclassical economics, which acts as if history does not exist.  While it does appear today that Moore's law is still true as chip designs deliver what is miscalled computer &quot;power&quot; (the &quot;power&quot; to deliver wrong answers at high speed should be deconstructed) and is actually mere clock speed at an exponentially increasing rate, an historical perspective should remind us  that this too, shall pass.<br />Making smaller chips is a labor process which has damaged the water-table of places like Silicon Valley and which represents the personal choices of venture capitalists to fund, entrepreneurs to entrep, and employees to choose to work in moon suits that are damned itchy at the end of the day.  <br />Moore's law, like so many &quot;laws&quot; of neoclassical economics, declares that in 1971 we stumbled upon a fact of nature, like Parson Malthus observing the lads cavorting with milkmaids.  It is secretly normative (like so many laws of the dismal science) in that it commands us to conform to this fact of nature as a ticket to adulthood.<br />Perhaps &quot;computers are takin' over.&quot; But a critical history of technology, which to me is the only study worthy of the name of history, would read against the grain.  It would narrate world praxis in hardware and in software as did a 1999 IEEE Transactions (in the History of Computers) which showed how the Swedes got by in the 1960s without IBM mainframes.  It would narrate victim history, including the very interesting history of computer programmers who, it seems, have been an invisible class because they represent, all the way down, a counter-narrative to the dominant narrative of an autonomous technology to which we have to conform (for example, the biography of computer pioneer Ted Nelson is more interesting than that of John von Neumann.)<br />A veryuseful result of such a history would be applied, retro computing, for while mainstream historians like Ceruzzi are laying the past to rest, libraries, universities and other institutions are losing data through losing the software that formats and reads older data files.  The XML (eXtended Markup Language) notation tries to address this problem as did Ted Nelson's Xanadu system but technical innovations, useful as they are, by definition do not address existing Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets (or the moldering Algol compiler I discovered at Princeton.)<br />I look to a book and software system on CD-ROM that would preserve, not the physical realization of outdated systems like the IBM 7090 or TRS-80, but their important features, which was the &quot;architecture&quot; they presented to their actual programmers.  While building a retro computer encyclopaedia would be a formidable task, it would be made easier by describing the architectural interface of the computer in a form that a modern system can &quot;compile&quot; to a program that simulates the old computer, thereby presenting the user of the encyclopaedia with actual running examples of old software.<br />To modern-day crowds, trooping through the Smithsonian, computers are physical objects.  But actual programmers know that computers are ideas in the mind, and a retro encyclopaedia would be a fascinating narrative of how Turing's idea created the postmodern era.  It would also make clear that the old fraud, Marx, was right, for the value computers has created for society consists in a deep labor of understanding architectures enough to craft problem instructions, including the most despised yet most valuable instruction: &quot;computer, here is a language in which I shall speak, and here is how you shall translate that language.&quot;<br />This is a grand yet critical narrative, for it shows that Leibniz was wrong.  Let us not calculate (sir) let us communicate.  I probably expect too much of poor Mr Ceruzzi, whoappears to be of the tribe of people with which I made acquaintance at Princeton; the humanists who honestly apply their narrative skills to technology.  But it appears that in America, no-one has answered Derrida's 1978 call for a critical reading of technology.	2001-11-25

In Bush v Gore five conservative justices violated their own rules in order to obtain the result they wanted.  In so doing, the conservatives also stated that their per curiam ruling was not to be treated as a precedent.  This is alarming because a ruling described by a court in this way is essentially &quot;private law&quot;, law which names specific parties (in this case, Bush.)  <br />Private law is undemocratic, since law in a democracy does not identify individuals by name.    A public law (or a Supreme Court interpretation) is usually drafted to say that a harm or favor applies to a set of people described &quot;intensionally&quot;, by means of a rule.  A private law identifies a list of people (sometimes restricted to one element) without a rule.  At best, private laws can be bought and sold.  At worst, private laws are lists of troublemakers to be detained without trial.<br />Private law is corruption, but as Shakespeare shows in Julius Caesar, treason that prospers is not labeled treason.  Nor is corruption.  Opponents of the result in Bush v. Gore should foreground the very notion of high-class judicial corruption as does the Dersh here.<br />Dershowitz shows how in certain cases, adherence to party line political principles, no matter how high-minded, can be a form itself of corruption for it makes the corrupted judge over-certain of his wisdom and all too ready as a result to preside over Inquisitions, autos da fe, witch trials and various other forms of the Bloody Assize, including the detention of material witnesses without bail.  <br />Shakespeare's Brutus is more deeply corrupted than Cassius, for Brutus actually believes that preservation of a republican form of government justifiesregicide, while Cassius is only ambitious.  Shakespeare's Roman and History plays, in Richard II, Coriolanus and Brutus, return often to the theme of the principled man without the moral compass provided by common sense.<br />However, the paralell between Antonin Scalia and Brutus cannot be pushed too far, for Scalia's, Thomas' and O'Connor's adherence to conservative principles even at the expense of logic provides them real material benefits.  <br />Brutus, or for that matter Calpurnia, would not have thrown, as Sandra Day O'Connor threw, a hissy fit at the prospect of not being able to retire from public life, but Dershowitz recounts that Justice O'Connor did so when it appeared that Gore would be elected and she would have to stay on to prevent a Democratic appointee.  <br />In high-class corruption, simple logic was abused in Bush v Gore.  Contempt was displayed for the powers of ratiocination, indeed the attention span, of the ordinary citizen as the conservative majority stopped the recount and, a few days later, announced that there was not enough time to ensure a result consistent with a Constitutional amendment (the Fourteenth) for which, on Dec 12, they found a sudden care.<br />Quiet and neutral commentators, that questioned the need for a speedy resolution, were shouted down (in part by mobs) as Gore partisans.  The problem is that the charge of partisanship can be made so readily as to be empty of content, for the very viability of the official process assumes that thousands of citizens, including the ordinary election workers that count the votes, can suspend partisanship for the greater health of the process.<br />To Gore partisans, who thought the Supreme Court was biased and indeed corrupted on December 12, it is said that the Florida supreme court, as packed with Democratic appointees, was likewise biased.  But &quot;you're another&quot; is a logical fallacy for two wrongs do not make a right UNLESS on December 12 the Supreme Court was resolving the harm created by the Florida court's bias.  But there was no such harm, because as Dershowitz shows, there was a genuine conflict of laws between the Florida constitution on weighting the intent of every ballot, and other (less important) Flordia statutes concerning the time to be taken.  It was the Florida court's task to resolve this conflict and the Supreme Court violated its sovereign powers in its decision.<br />What seems a hip, urbane, indeed almost Shakespearean attitude and which is prelevant among what passes for the educated is &quot;a plague upon both your houses.&quot;  Forgetting that Shakespeare didn't like Mercutio all that much and forgetting that Mercutio's dying words are an evasion of responsibility for egging Tybalt on, plague-upon-both-your-houses thinking evades responsibility.<br />Dersh makes clear what a cast of characters presides on the court, from Justice Antonin &quot;what a day for an auto da fe&quot; Scalia, whose conservative Catholicism makes him unsuitable for any court but that of the Inquisition, to Clarence &quot;sports pages&quot; Thomas, who refuses to read law outside of what Scalia tells him to read, to Justice &quot;hissy fit&quot; O'Connor, who learned in Goldwater's Arizona to confuse her desires with the health of the Republic, and whose spiritual forebears, in the words of one historian, threw a childish tantrum in San Francisco's Cow Palace in 1964 because they wanted to lose to LBJ.<br />Having been taught that they deserve happiness, whether a flush 401K or retirement in Arizona, my generation is all too ready to gloss anxiety and selfishness with a sort of neo-Romanticism which balks at the hard work of politics, and political (and other) forms of mere data processing.  The December 12 decision relies heavily on an uncertainty principle which states that of necessity a further ballot count would be hard to perform accurately.  <br />Technical answers so beloved by Republicans have the effect of alienating us fromboth census and poll, with the result that we elevate our mistrust of errors to a political principle.  On Dec 12, broad principles gave way to arbitrary rules, showing a systematic inability to risk judgement in a society demoralized by affluence.	2001-11-13
US	50358924	R1VHQDVU057RES	0812210581	760924305	On the Old Saw: That May be Right in Theory But It Won't Work in Practice (Works of continental philosophy)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Purity of intellect converges with purity of heart	One way of approaching Kant is less through his massive central works and more through his applications of his thought in lesser works.<br />Here, Kant addresses a &quot;saw&quot; that forms part of received wisdom, and that is that the person who insists on a matter of (scientific or ethical) principle is somehow less than mature.<br />For example, we are told we must accept the conduct of the war in central Asia, with its high level of secrecy, undocumented civilian casualties and detention without trial of material witnesses as the only possible response to the attack of September 11, and that to apply current international law's theories is the mark of the person out of the loop.<br />However, to do so ignores a recent development in international law which Kant in another work presaged, and which received attention when traditional international law produced a humanitarian disaster in the Balkans.<br />Traditional international law, under which the American conduct of the current war operates, is might makes right and asserts as an axiom that the sovereign's will cannot be questioned.<br />The problem is that this cannot be stated in polite circles in Western democracies today with anything like full theoretical force, since if it is true that the sovereign's will operates without check internationally, this is equally true, when push comes to shove, in the domestic sphere.  <br />If America has the right to bomb civilians and withhold information from journalists internationally, the thoughtful American citizen has no coherent way of objecting to collateral domestic damage to civil liberties.  This is shown clearly by the fact that in the post Sep-11 climate, the Administration has been able to pass laws by means of which the government may search an individual's home and only later notify him that the search has been conducted...on the face of it, quite unreasonable in the meaning of our Constitution.<br />To avoid this painful conclusion, the common responseis the one made long ago to Kant, when he made his own ethical and political recommendations based on his central insight: that there are indeed synthetic apriori features of the world that organize thought, and consequently behavior.<br />This is &quot;that might be right in theory but 'twon't work in practice.&quot;<br />To which Kant replies that the pragmatic objection is actually a theory in and of itself, added as a rider clause to the theory.<br />Kant's thought has a structural insistence that we think through the consequences of our patches and other repairs to thought.  For in the same way that Kant objected to the American Revolution's claim of a &quot;right&quot; of revolution, by quietly pointing out that the right to overthrow the sovereign fails to accomplish the mission, by making the American people (or, in practice, a fascist majority) the real sovereign, anti-theory  finds itself in the position of St Augustine' pirate, or the 17th century bucanneer Israel Hands.<br />This is the usurper who, after usurpation, cannot find a narrative other than that of the sovereign against whom he mounted his rebellion.<br />The person who'd usurp pedantry and theory in the name of hairy-chested practice finds himself in the same position as Israel hands, who when asked why he turned pirate and slew the gentry, could only claim impure appetite, saying &quot;because I wanted their pickles and wines.&quot;  That is, the anti-theoretic man of the saw or rule of thumb wants, in real life, to set up shop as the REAL theoretician.<br />The problem is that his saws are so often incoherent that they require further saws and ultimately result in incoherence.  He winds up in charge of a moronic inferno marked by the inability of its elite to provide clear direction, except in the general direction of perdition.<br />In current international contexts, it is quite convenient to powerful figures to decry theory and denounce the professoriat, for appended to any one of our international committments, it gives the power elite an unlimited blank check.  Left romantics only assist this process by hypostatizing the anti-intellectual proletarian style when in fact the current working class is set to intellectual and symbolic tasks.<br />This is probably the reason for its astonishing vernacular power in so many apparently unrelated areas of American life.  For example, as a software developer who's interested in software correctness, I hear this objection frequently to the very idea of any kind of qualitative oversight of software.<br />There is in general an accepted, and to me quite deviant, disconnect in my culture between our good intentions (or, to be painfully precise, our idea of our intentions as good, and quite unlike those of Islam and the &quot;terrorists&quot;) and our results.  It is to me constituted in a split between the normative and the description which a close reading of Kant can heal, for Kant seems to be at that rarefied, almost childlike plane before there are words like &quot;theory&quot; as opposed to &quot;practice&quot;, and &quot;what I should do&quot; as opposed to what in hell is going on.<br />Like the forest entered by Alice in Wonderland in which there were no names, Kant manages to identify for us a world, probably the real world, that existed before we dreamt up our cozy categories.  We accuse the messenger, Kant, of such dreaming but if you actually trouble to READ his stuff you find a unique purity, which refuses to end discussion with noise about &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;practice&quot;...as if, at the end of the day and in the presence of our common mortality, there was such cozy furniture to begin with.	2001-11-11

For his deconstructive admission, encapsulated in the awesome Latin of the Dies Irae, is \\"cum vix justus sit securus?\\" (which of the just shall sit secure?)<br />Mr White refuses from deep naivety to be the self-possessed Cartesian subject that the police investigation demands and instead presents himself as he actually feels he is. This is a person who cannot assert that his biography exhausts his life, or his personal responsibility for a murder that, he admits, he may have committed in a fugue state. This is a person who uses writing like an elderly person with Alzheimer's (who writes \\"the woman in your house is named Judith, and she is your wife\\" in a notebook, as an aide-memoire) in the dangerous manner of the Platonic pharmakon<br />But there is to me something deeply moving about Mr White.<br /> This novel shows the alternative to such innocence, either the total sacrifice of the innocent or a sacrifice of innocent regions of the heart. The remaining regions are those that say I am no widow and there ain't no flies on me. A simple, deconstructive admission that things might be otherwise is a form of deconstructive prayer <br />We then are in Mr White's world where a song is not a thing at all, and hope is the thing with feathers.	2001-11-01
US	50358924	R3MWJG07YPNFVF	0375758259	389338120	When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management	Books	4	4	7	N	N	Good analysis, but fails to address the real problem	This book is about a defunct era, that of the 1990s, and it well-documents the rise and fall of Long-Term Capital Management.<br />As Robert Shiller's related text, Irrational Exuberance, shows, the 1990s, like most American boom times, were characterized by a faith in a basket of propositions including technology and &quot;rationality.&quot;<br />Because of a faith in a rationality that was more a sign and less a fully-investigated phenomenon, banks and investors threw money at John Meriwether and his band of merry men.  Their rationality consisted in a thoroughgoing application of Merton-Scholes trading models to finance, which replaced integer, discrete models with continuous models.<br />Unfortunately, a hidden presumption was 100% faith in Say's Law: that markets always clear, and any buyer will find his seller.  As Lowenstein shows this presumption failed in Aug 1998, and, if any further refutation was needed, it failed again after Sep 11 when the closing of the exchange was a refutation of Say's Law.<br />Note that the &quot;rationality&quot; was a shaky edifice based on classical economics.<br />Meriwether would have done well to read Barbara Ehrenreich's Sullivans' Travels like book, NICKEL AND DIMED: On (not) getting by in America, for a technical reason. <br />This is because in the REAL world of the poor and middle class, Say's Law is a fantasy, and transaction costs, owing to the laws of small numbers, overwhelm an economic &quot;rationality&quot; which is based on a high and positive net worth.  In the real world, people trained for jobs cannot get them (there is no buyer for the seller) and the ATM won't dispense under 20.00 even if you prefer it would (there is no seller for the buyer.)  <br />Banks were chasing after Meriwether because they had millions of dollars to lend, and not once did they think about directing these funds to real needs including microlending.  As a result, boys are dying in Peshawar because the only work available to them is digging for scraps of metal.  For this reason alone, the tax law needs to be revised to return to steeply progressive levels (90 cents on the last dollar earned by the wealthy), and to prevent overly elaborate arbitrage in the future.<br />Unfortunately, Lowenstein instead recommends that we consider a mystified &quot;human factor.&quot;  In actuality, it is probable that Meriwether's software people could have predicted the anomalous developments of August 1999 and from Lowenstein's book it appears that they were neither asked, nor given information about the real prospects of the firm.  This is not a human factor, it is the mathematical casting-in-concrete of the &quot;laws&quot; of people whom Keynes described as long-dead scribblers, resurrected by madmen in authority.	2001-10-23
US	50358924	R24BOXT6IVM3FB	0804744262	305994198	Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason'	Books	5	14	31	N	Y	Readable analysis of Kant	This is a readable series of lectures on Kant by a man who was a genuine anti-philosopher.<br />As in many texts of the Frankfurt School, the Marxism is recreational. As Rolf Wiggershaus' history of the Frankfurt School indicates, Adorno and especially Horkheimer were always careful to sideline Marxist analysis.  References to the &quot;material basis&quot; of apprehension of space and time, and of Kant's system considered historically, seem to be muted.<br />A key to understanding Adorno on Kant is an understanding of the negative concept of reification.<br />It is hard to foreground a negative concept, rigourously cancelling out invalid pictures of the world...including the image that arises from the very phrase, picture of the world, which is itself reified and not a little sad, in that the subject becomes a lonely visitor to an otherwise deserted sort of cinema on a senior citizen's discount.<br />The unconscious habit of reification is a feature of the &quot;educated&quot; elite of a postmodern late capitalism, in that in recent years and since Adorno's death in 1970, this class has shifted from reproducing itself by labor to commodifying, packaging and peddling reified forms of its labor.  As opportunities for the so-called &quot;chattering class&quot; to work in media and government have declined in Western societies, increasingly the educated elite must marketize its production.<br />Of course, this process destroys new opportunities since the dominant form of any one intellectual commodity, while not identical to similar &quot;products&quot;, has a tendency through extra-market means to eliminate competition.  These extra-market means range from network externalities in the computer business to personal brutality (up to and including force and fraud) on the part of some entrepreneurs.<br />Nonetheless it is our responsibility to realize that here Adorno is trying to express a truth that is not (as it is pictured by incompetent, which is to say modal, professors of philosophy) at all captured by a reified IMAGE of the mind, a wall straight out of Pyramus and Thisbe (in Adorno's book, the &quot;block&quot;), and the Kantian things in themselves.<br />For Adorno, subjectivity and objectivity do not represent independent categories (this seems to be a theme of his late work.)  Descartes, starting with an extreme subjectivity, felt compelled to logically derive an objective world.  This while securing objectivity as far as Descartes, and perhaps his Mom, were concerned, made it in terms of an ontological pecking-order logically derived from the cogito.  But the entire edifice's very danger of collapse becomes to the artisan philosopher a source of continued unease.<br />Adorno instead proposes a negative critique.  What if subjectivity and objectivity are neither irreducible the one to the other?<br />It seems that for Ted, subjectivity's objective content and its synthetic apriori features are a necessary feature of subjectivity, and the continuous apprehension of an objective reality by a mininum of one subject mean that the two categories are both necessary, do not presuppose each other and form an organic unity.<br />Moreover, another necessary feature of subjectivity is its shareablility as opposed to dreams and other fugue states. Western philosophy has been starting with Descartes has been overly concerned with nondefault states as a sort of clever dodge and one reflects on the fondness of philosophy graduate students, during the collapse of American analytic philosophy during the 1970s, for the bottle.  Recent philosophy, perhaps due to muscular feminism, has restored the default state of healthy consciousness to center stage without too much back-talk from surviving members of the analytic tribe, who are too hung-over to come up with any more clever counter-examples.<br />Furthermore, if we deny that we are talking about an empirical I as studied by cognitive neuroscience, dreams and fugue states automatically become of less interest.  For the most part, the phenomenological world consists of me when NOT in any form of fugue state, and my fellow citizens NOT in any form of fugue state.  And even if we bracket out considerations of existence the world contains history in the form of multiple generations of people passing through different stages of life.<br />A difference between discourse about the &quot;I', the ego, the subject, in English-American analytic philosophy, and the way it is discussed in Kant and the philosophers after him including Adorno, is that the &quot;I&quot; of the latter has a normative content.  An older era would say a certain amount of healthy-mindedness is found in this &quot;I&quot; as a necessary feature for this is the only way we can generalize this &quot;I&quot; so that statements about it can apply to ALL &quot;I's.&quot;<br />A common feature of fugue states, from the brown study to the full-bore alcoholic toot, is the destruction, first of intersubjectivity and then subjectivity.  I am well aware that it would be pernicious to merely assume healthy-mindedness and this entire area is in need of further research.<br />We can find transcendental arguments in the strangest places as in the case of discourse ethics, and the need for citizens (to be citizens) to be assured of minimal political and economic rights.<br />For example, a feature of American debates on health insurance happens to be neglect of its transcendental character.  If we presuppose a political and independent sphere consisting of Lockean subjects with strong rights and responsibilities, then the physical liquidation (even though gradual, and no-one's responsibility) of these subjects because, transcendentally, our concern.<br />This is to arrive (I believe) at Husserl's strong protest against the accusation that Husserl was an empirical psychologist when Husserl described shared ideas.<br />A Continental tradition of which Adorno and Husserl are a part declares that there are, over and above the empirical contents of our minds, intersubjective concepts including ethical and artistic concepts.  Husserl was not a psychologist maudit, nor was Kant a cognitive neuroscientist, because in Husserl's case Ideas could not be abstracted from the content and in Kant's case the subject's apprehension of reality was not guaranteed by an empirical nexus.<br />Kant's world is established by declaring victory; not so much the triumphant cry I am but the greater shout it is.lly become of less interest.

US	50358924	R35MXZLEZOL8CP	1893115976	184799915	Moving to VB .NET: Strategies, Concepts, and Code	Books	5	20	29	N	N	You need this book bad if you are a VB programmer	A specter is haunting Visual Basic: the specter of VB.Net.<br />As Dan Appleman makes clear, the party is over for Visual Basic.  Because it was its own world with its own rules, projects consistently failed when VB 3..6 was the development language, and there is currently an apparent hiring freeze.  Most ads are demanding C++ and Oracle and not VB and SQL Server in my informal surveys.  [Note: my observations, not Dan's.]<br />The reason may also be the FUD factor created by VB.Net which Dan does his best to clear up.  <br />The news is bad if like many VB programmers you do not know objects cold, and worse if your little &quot;shop&quot; forbids (as happened in an example in my experience) &quot;mere&quot; programmers from creating objects, forcing them to use replicated forms and code.<br />Everything changes.  For example, using VB strings to append, although supported in VB.Net, takes TWENTY TIMES the speed that an object (System.Text.Stringbuilder) takes, and Dan reveals StringBuilder and dozens of other solutions.  <br />Old Visual Basic spoon-fed functionality by making it part of the syntax.  VB.Net, more like C and C++, forces the programmer to refer to a library, in the case of VB.Net, the Net Framework.<br />Dan is breathtaking on multiple threads because he is concerned, unlike many programmers, about the worst bug in the world, and that is the bug you never know about.  He shows how this can easily happen when mindless coders use multiple threads as a result of the granularity of the Common Interface Language.<br />Get this book.  Wrox press, publisher of far more clunky texts written by developers with their pictures on the cover for some silly reason (for us software types are hardly sexy), has two books on the shelves of my local Noble Barn bookstore, and they manfully give you, like Jack Webb, just the facts.<br />They have their place although as Dan points out in his readable and opinionated way, Visual Basic programmers need to grow up and research primary sources including MSDN and CD Rom documentation.  <br />But Dan provides, in his wisdom and experience with VB (which trumps mine, for I started with 3 and Dan started with 1), an interpretive framework.  <br />Your manager should also read his book in order to start to do what managers do when they get all visionary, and stuff (like think about next week, and stuff.)<br />For example, while VB.Net fully addresses the need to resize controls and forms, this means that your &quot;shop&quot; needs new standards lest forms start resizing in strange ways.<br />Also, forms now have an incredibly cool Opacity property...for which I cannot think of a use...what would it mean, to an end user, for a form to start fading away, like Hamlet's Dad in the morning?  A tech writer at Bell Northern Research, using the IBM mainframe, told me that she felt already like Ingrid Bergman in the film Gaslight, wherein Charles Boyer fools with the analogue settings on the gas-powered lights in order to convince poor Ingrid that she's nuts.  Fading forms and forms slowly materializing could really drive sensitive souls crazy.<br />However, they may have a use because they could expose hints, documentation, and subliminal exhortations to work harder.  I am using a transparent form as the needle in a speedometer so I can see the rate at which the measured process is proceeding.  <br />VB.Net is just chock-full of such cool things and the question for serious developers and managers is what to do with such coolness.  VB.Net STILL does not have a simple command to self-interpret (this would enable developers to give VB.Net away) but it does have the ability to generate compiled CIL code...it is now possible to write production compilers in VB.Net.  <br />Dan has done the world a service by writing his well-informed opinions.  I am a disciple of the Apple man because I like airing opinions too, but Dan backs them up with experience and knowledge, while I have been known to pop off occasionally for the hell of it.  This went over great in art school and in Paris but in computers, dominated as they are by clerks, you gotta have your facts straight.  Dan can be trusted, and I keep his book handy as I delve in VB.Net.	2001-09-27

Although Lady Thatcher, who seems to be descending into a form of insanity, said recently &quot;there is no such thing as society&quot;, ordinary working people, who cannot afford gated communities, must perforce live in society.<BR><BR><BR>Numeric results, innocent of theory, are useless for insight and only theory can match the qualitative texture of daily life. This is perhaps why Adorno's American typists at the Princeton Radio Research project both understood his &quot;complex&quot; prose and were sympathetic to his conclusions, while his &quot;educated&quot; superiors thought him &quot;elitist.&quot;<BR><BR><BR>One of Marcuse's insights into Nazi society describes the ordinary person as informed by &quot;matter of fact cynicism&quot;. Perhaps because of Marcuse's German background, he here fashions a surprising neologism, a Katzenjammer, a jamming-together of concepts useful precisely because it is striking. This neologistic fashioning of terms-of-art is a permission German gives the speaker which his withheld, superficially, by English.<BR><BR><BR>The cynical are not usually thought of as matter-of-fact, and the matter-of-fact, not usually thought of as cynical. The two sets, while not considered disjoint, are not considered to largely intersect.<BR><BR><br />Nonetheless, Marcuse's insight captured something about German society during the war that many observers missed. The ordinary German mind was thought by Anglo-American commentators to share in the mysticism of Hitler.<BR><BR><BR>But Marcuse saw that the ordinary German, although silenced, was quite cynical about the war and Hitlerdom. Much later, Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's research has confirmed Marcuse's hypothesis, for in the latter's book HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONERS,Goldhagen finds that many Germans were, as matter-of-fact cynics, not willing to participate in the Holocaust but equally unwilling to make a protest. This combination may have resulted from what Marcuse described as the destruction of pre-war Wilhelmine patriarchy and the regression to the matter-of-fact cynicism which is the protective coloration of silenced women. <BR><BR>The execution of a Rosa Luxembourg had shown countless Germans the consequence of protest while not necessarily convincing them that their leaders were anything but fools and madmen. The patriarchal response, commencing with the German revolts to Napoleon's rule during its awakening in 1800, was to act on the revolutionary belief. The matter-of-fact cynical response was quietism.<BR><BR><BR>The Nazis in their origin in reaction to the Left revolutions of 1918 had succeeded in &quot;debunking&quot; liberatory narratives and in making resistance seem foolish. Young Germans of the Weimar period would be psychically familiar to young Americans of today, in the naivete of believing oneself free of &quot;illusions.&quot;  <BR><BR>The destruction of German patriarchy also foreshadows the consequences of the destruction of patriarchy good and bad in American life, where Lost Boys, filled with fancies but empty of &quot;illusions&quot;, curse women in darkened streets and bars reminiscent of Cabaret.<BR><BR><BR>This is the most troubling aspect of Marcuse's work: the fact that modern Americans, at least prior to the watershed of Sept 11 2001, were in their high levels of cynicism, their growing inability to treat their psychological troubles with anything other than legal or illegal drugs, and their pseudo-sophisticated, &quot;ironic&quot; rejection of narrative grand and small, closer to Weimar and Hitler period Germans than their grandparents.<BR><BR><BR>Marcuse's insights led him in later life to a more general critique of society as composed of &quot;one-dimensional&quot;, disempowered atoms. Only byactively maintaining an alternative stance to generalized depression can one prevent cynical matter-of-factness from taking over one's life.	2001-09-23
US	50358924	R3O0OA3S99JCTD	0823218821	43226600	Murrow: His Life and Times (Communications and Media Studies)	Books	5	9	14	N	N	An excellent book	Modern pop history is in part a rewriting, and obscuring, of what really happened in midcentury America.  Thus television programming recognized as garbage when it was aired is celebrated today in museums (for example, the Smithsonian saw fit to commemorate the Dukes of Hazzard.)<br />Thus the rather innocuous commentator Walter Cronkite is the grand old man, whereas Sperber's Murrow is known only to journalism wonks.<br />The shallowness of the broadcast, electronic media, which prized immediacy (the now) from its inception, is hard on any sort of historical accuracy in commemorating Murrow.  Had Murrow lived at the time of Thomas Carlyle or Walter Bagehot he would have been, I think, more kindly treated: for the medium of the book is friendlier to the very idea of preservation of the memory of the author.  The whole material point of broadcast, and the Internet, is extraction of content from modern denizens of grub Street, who dare not think of themselves as authors, let alone bourgeois subjects with social power over and above that of the corporation.<br />Murrow, with a certain naivety, thought to use radio and then TV to communicate a level of complexity to the ordinary man only seen in books.  But even his allies saw that the medium is the message (not necessarily a benign fact, nor one to be celebrated, as McLuhan himself spelled out in The Mechanical Bride.)  <br />Reading a book imparts a certain depth and respect for complexity in the reader.  Half-listening to a lunatic like Sen \\"Tail Gunner Joe\\" McCarthy while doing the dishes is apt to impart oversimplified half truths, a fact which McCarthy was low enough to use.  While first-order McCarthyism in the form of naive anti-Communism is on the wane, second-order McCarthyism, where signifiers such as \\"economic growth\\" and the fear of job loss replace the red Menace and are used by the cynical in precisely the same way McCarthy used \\"communists in the State department that lost China.\\"<br />Murrow's respect for complexity and willingness to try to communicate complex truths to the audience ultimately, as Sperber relates, had him gently retired from CBS and into directorship of the US Information Agency under Kennedy.<br />This book is an excellent read.  It points up the fact that in many ways, the 1960s and 1970s were an infantile reaction to mere complexity and nuance.  In this reaction, the popular mind was subtly persuaded to think of commentators, who did not pander to the worst in us, as stuffed shirts who \\"think they know more than the common lot.\\"  Thus even Cronkite was more acceptable because he hewed more closely to the policy that jelled under Murrow and that is described by Sperber, a policy in which departure from a vague centrist position was \\"opinion and not fact\\", but \\"facts\\" could include quite a lot of opinion...as long as it followed a centrist party line.<br />For example, as LA commentator Mike Davis points out in Ecology of Fear, wild fires are news only if they threaten upscale houses.  This is now \\"fact\\": fires in ... SROs in downtown LA are no longer news, but fires near big ranches (probably referred to by their Yupped out owner with Yup irony as \\"mah spread\\") are news leaders.  For the same reason that underpaid smoke jumpers die protecting \\"mah spread\\" (on the public dime, I might add), a fire in Malibu, or in Jackson Hole, is a \\"fact\\": a fire in LA or even Idaho Falls is a nonfact, and it shows \\"bias\\" and \\"opinion\\" to foreground this interpretive bias.<br />No opinion wants in logic to be an opinion.  An ordinary man, expressing the \\"opinion\\" that the Chicago Cubs will take the pennant this year, is not shooting off opinions for theire own sake.  Instead, our boy wants his \\"opinion\\" to become solid fact in the future.<br />Likewise, when Ed Murrow gave his famous anti-McCarthy broadcast, he was not, in good conscience, stating mere personal opinions for there own sake.  His opinions wanted to be mere facts about Tail Gunner Joe, and Murrow's managers would have done well to state more clearly, not that the broadcaster not state \\"personal opinions\\", but instead that the broadcaster either state the opinions of the owners of the station, or else zip up, and restrict himself to such facts (such as the words coming off the wire service copy) that everyone, except the clinically insane, agrees to be facts.<br />Falsity and intellectual dishonesty is a toxic byproduct of media with longterm effects, and it can be stated fairly that Murrow may have been able to stop smoking if he had been able to come to a more honest contract with his employers.  Instead, Paley and Stanton (despite the better angels of their nature) used the guy.  During the 1940s and on radio, Ed Murrow's left-liberal views were simply less hazardous and more popular with viewers than they became in the 1950s, and Murrow was eased out as his entire perspective, and on-air persona, became less intelligible to a more suburban, less unionized viewership.<br />Of course, Paley and Stanton could not have done otherwise, and Frank Stanton much later (in a brouhaha over a late 1960s program) proved he had integrity.  Perhaps the broadcast journalist should be an independent contractor who buys time from the airwaves under some sort of deal and says whatever he wants to say, making the listeners the ultimate arbiter of whether the guy is worth listening-to.  But the problem with this pure market model is of course the bearer of bad news and the odd Cassandra who is confused with the content of the bad news, and whose value to society (in warning society of the ways in which it is in trouble) cannot be reflected in a market model at all.  Nobody goes to the fair to buy a Nasty Story, or a detailed list of his own defects of character.  The Catholic did not pay the priest to hear his confession.  <br />No society can tolerate, under a pure market model, a Savonarola or Murrow at his most extreme, and legal professor Cass Sunstein (cf. Republic.COM)shows, gently, how a pure market model leads to \\"cascades\\" of opinions, where Internet users have gorged themselves sick on falsity (such as the centrality of the Second Amendment, or the wickedness of Clinton), and, bulimically, spread their fantasies.  This of course is where government by the people, for the people and of the people comes into play, including a Constitutional role for the super-ego (aka \\"the Nanny State.\\")  <br />In an era of pandering to malformed ids and egos that find their ego satisfaction in pure transfer of negative emotions to the Other, this is of course a non-starter, but this merely shows how far we've declined (from Ed Murrow to hate radio.)	2001-08-10

One of Meg Thatcher's unsung accomplishments happens to be giving some of the most egregious examples of the upper class the boot.<br />But the real story is here, in Hobsbawm's essay Victorian Values.<br />Skilled men in Britain in the 19th century were justly proud of their status.  They after all bent metal and other recalcitrant materials (in ways we no longer teach the young, allowing computers to do the job) and formed the railways which at first frightened the toffs (the Duke of Wellington himself was astonished that a thing could go so fast) and which the upper crust then took for granted.<br />Their &quot;Victorian Values&quot; weren't, on Hobsbawm's account, bloody-mindedness.  They were part of being sober or teetotal, industrious, church-going and caring for their families.<br />That is: the man who thought it a natural law that he should have some of his employer's time, at the close of business, to properly care for his own tools was a man who could ask justly for this time because he also went to church and took care of his family.<br />Contrast the post-modern scene.  Employers today refuse to get lured into time-consuming debate about natural justice, whether with unions or piecemeal.  <br />Modern corporations, by encouraging personal experimentation, have liberated a lot of people, but Hobsbawm shows that perhaps conservatives are being disingenuous when they call uponworking people to settle down, and return to Victorian Values.<br />For if a man returns to the moral law the 8 hour day may again be seen to be natural, and many other work rules which are said to hamper the overarching command to be &quot;productive.&quot;	2001-03-25

Books	3	6	22	N	N	To live outside the law you must be honest	While this book is an excellent recount of the truth of life as lived for most of us (including an essay on what it is like for a real working person to live and work in France, which is no piqnique by any means), literature has a dual duty.<br />One is to tell the truth about mere suffering and of course Temp Slave does so.<br />The other is to reinforce the lesson with a committment to truth and Temp Slave does not do so.<br />That is, it is disingenuous to want to hold the wicked capitalists to schoolbook notions of honesty and plain dealing when within the same essay you recommend an interesting variety of ways of soldiering, goofing off, and stealing time.<br />Leon Trotsky tried and failed to answer the question of ethics in &quot;Their Morals and Ours.&quot;  One can read Lev Davidovich as wanting to live justly but ultimately painting himself in a dead end because of a misreading of Marx, and the result was tragic, involving as it did a hammer in the head in Mexico.<br />The only answer is an absolute committment, from the subordinate side of the job equation, to honesty and fair dealing, leavened with an absolute committment to solidarity with one's fellow workers, extending up into middle management, and, to the extent that CEOs are human, to Jack Welch of General Electric.  The lesson of our century is that peaceful change succeeds whereas violent revolution and sabotage does not, instead producing the opposite of the desired effect (as well as good old Fascism.)<br />The hatred we've seen for people like Mihail Gorbachev seems focused on their verbosity (Gorbachev gets on Russian TV, only to be cut off.)  But verbosity itself may only be the process of peaceful change speaking the truth in Taoist fashion, a dripdrop of water wearing away the rock.<br />The authors in Temp Slave seem anti-intellectual and so exhausted by their jobs and pleasures that they would not sit still for a Gorbachev: but I cannot see how they then have any alternative to today's computerized and prison-like work place.<br />Human affairs do not follow the rules of machines and soldiering, goofing off and stealing time does not make it hard for the bosses.  They have ways of predicting such antics and compensating for them, and one of the most popular ways is cracking down on us fools who try not to goof off.<br />Human affairs follow the laws of the dialectic, or perhaps chaos theory.  Thus bloody-mindedness is not a revolutionary act taking place in a vacuum but dialogic...it sends a message to the bosses, all right, and the message gets an instant response in the form of INCREASED amounts of workplace surveillance and increased crackdowns on The Rest of Us.<br />It's all very well to feel oh-so-superior to your lifer coworkers when you are a temp of arcane sexual persuasion with an advanced degree in Irish economic history.  For it is true that society and the workplace damages people.<br />But check out your own damage first.  While the women narrators of Temp Slave try to maintain a connection with the earth by taking breaks in a nearby park, the male writers seem to maintain a connection with Budweiser in their off-hours.<br />That's all very well: it is not for me to deny a workingman his pleasures.  But it means that we cannot make absolute statements about what pathetic losers fulltime employees are when in many cases they are making the best of a bad situation.<br />To live outside the law, you must be honest, and I look for a literature of work that is honest all the way down.  I do not find it in Temp Slave.  Instead, I found it in Ellen Ullman's SLAVES TO THE MACHINE, about what it is like to be a REAL computer programmer, only a cut or so higher on the food chain than the temp.  <br />I know you always say that you agree: so where are you tonight, Sweet Marie?	2001-03-01
US	50358924	RJ6VUM99FHT9Q	0932633420	457787035	The Psychology of Computer Programming: Silver Anniversary Edition	Books	5	18	42	N	N	Rereading Weinberg	I bought this book in 1972 (it set me back almost ten bucks!) and read it cover to cover in a single night.<br />Weinberg spoke to the human situation of programming and as a very young programmer I found the book excellent.<br />However, I have seen his ideas systematically distorted in practice.  The idea of programmer &quot;humility&quot; is all very well: but our society does not reward the humble, and the notion that one must be humble has transformed software developers from the uppity hippies of the early 1970s to a class of neo-monks, laboring to illuminate the sacred texts of a society that is obsessed, not with humility, but with power and control.<br />As Weinberg was well aware and retails in his book, &quot;structured programming&quot; has a definite mathematical meaning that was proven by two Italians in the 1960s: the result was that you can write any conceivable program using a surprisingly small set of logical patterns.<br />However, the phrase &quot;structured programming&quot; has in fact been generalized by both programmers and their managers.  &quot;That's not structured&quot; means in practice &quot;I don't understand it.&quot;  It has been inappropriately generalized to apply to programmers and has been used as a term of art by those who would discriminate on the basis of age.<br />In the artistic arena, deliberate introduction of new paradigms is usually benign.  The Dutch artist Piet Mondrian gained great power in his art by limiting himself to what be considered &quot;structured painting&quot;, for in his mature style, Mondrian refused to use other than lines at right angles and primary colors.<br />In the purely scientific arena, parsimony is also benign.  Donald Knuth, in commenting on the Dutchman Edsger Dijkstra's advocacy of structured programming, made a fascinating comparision to the intuitionist mathematics of the Dutch Brouwer, which refuses to use the law of excluded middle.<br />(Who let all these Hollanders in here, one might well ask.  While Amsterdam is a byword for freedom among flaming youth in America, Dutch parsimony is a more attractive characteristic.  Their national anthem itself (William of Nassau) celebrates William the Silent's refusal to renounce vassal status to the King of Spain, and his stand for ancient feudal rights.  The Dutch are an interesting bunch of people.)<br />But in the political arena, parsimony in particular and the deliberate, forced introduction of a paradigm shift becomes ideology which as Eagleton and Barthes have shown can become myth.  The most famous example is Marxism which over a period of about 130 years morphed from science to ideology to Stalinist religion to (perhaps) the scrap heap.  <br />In 1974, as a programmer, I was reminded by the early debates of how to program in structured Cobol of both my art school mates and my political confederates in the late 1960s.<br />When parsimony and paradigm shifts become commercial methodologies, as did structured programming under Ed Yourdon and others, the open question becomes, is the result benign (as in the minor debates between Mondrian and Theo Van Doesburg, another Dutch artist, over diagonal lines) or closer to Stalinism?<br />Unfortunately, the latter is true.  In somewhat the same way Marx was deliberately misread, the mathematical results of structured programming were used so loosely by data processing apparatchiks that the science became a science of surveillance and control.	2001-02-18
US	50358924	R2EBO88KS9GTAG	0394710347	123300767	Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession	Books	4	9	68	N	N	Out of date?	Readers should not look here for important recent developments, for this book was written in 1982.  It was written at the end of the popularity of psychoanalysis.<br />By 1982, starting in the 1960s, various new forms of therapy emerged in competition with psychiatry and although Malcolm gives these a nod for her classic Freudian analysis was the King, the Father, and the center.<br />This father is now as spectral as Hamlet's Dad, and even New Age therapies are beginning to fall into disrepute.  <br />The sort of personality able to play the role of analyst who himself does not buy in to whatever malarkey the patient is laying down is in decline these days, for more and more people including medical doctors do not have anything like Freud's 19th century confidence in the validity of an *haute* bourgeois biography.  Starting in the 1960s, analysts were not so confident that boys wanted to grow up to be what we now would think are stuffed shirts, and of course the story failed to fit women's aspirations.<br />However, as Robert Bly as pointed out, no new narrative replaced the old narrative with the result that psychiatrists can be as threatened or in general as dysfunctional as their patients.<br />Another problem lies in the fact that in 1982 and today, Americans pay their doctors (including their head shrink) using Someone Else's Money.<br />The best way to save for being physically sick in a laissez faire society is to have a 401K, and also to live a healthy lifestyle, including exercise, alcohol in moderation and tobacco not at all.  This way you have at least a chance of paying the bill even if uninsured, perhaps by making time payments and getting the caregivers to give you a break.  Or, you can use (disappearing) public institutions.<br />However, note that with regards to mental illness, the &quot;system&quot; that is preparing for the future by saving and leading a healthy lifestyle is by definition dysfunctional, and mental illness builds up over time.  Except for narrowly defined disorders, mental illness is a slow train coming and its onset often includes behaviors at odds with the norm recommended by laissez-faire.  There are exceptions, but for every head case who compulsively oversaves, taking the laissez-faire ideal to extremes, there are tens of nutbars who waste their money and engage in substance abuse.<br />This means that almost by definition societal provision has to be made for the mentally ill but almost by definition a laissez-faire society is unwilling to do so.  And to the extent that HMO and insurance companies internally resemble Socialist societies (in that they have the open-ended duty to care for the people who've paid premiums, as socialist states precommitt themselves to cradle-to-grave care for citizens) they are reluctant to pay for extended mental care.<br />However, as Malcolm points out, classic analysis is open-ended and difficult to terminate.  It seems to contemporary culture to be an iatrogenic time-waster, that causes wimped-out Woody Allen clones to acquire problems from the process itself.<br />Janet writes before developments in cognitive neuropsychiatry and drugs that have regressed the psychiatric profession to about the time of the phrenology that so outraged Hegel, by so reifying mental states in the sick and the normal as to be absurd.  It does appear that some cognitive neuropsychiatry gains explanatory power at the expense of ignoring interactions just as phrenology was attractive in the early 19th century, and Dr Peter Breggin has pointed out that the known effects of Prozac and similar concoctions are known only empirically in the form of success rates, and absence of side-effects.<br />The success rates of Prozac are reified as the explicit rates for the people studied.  The absence of side-effects can be refuted by a single toxic side-effect traceable to Prozac but can never be disproved, and the field of neuropharamacology is littered with miracle cures such as Valiumwhich turned out over time to be highly dangerous and addictive.  <br />At the same time Janet published PSYCHIATRY, a character in the early Madonna movie Desparately Seeking Susan was exclaiming &quot;take a Valium like a normal person!&quot;  We need to be skeptical of miracle cures and ask what was wrong with the Woody Allen syndrome, apart, of course, from Woody Allen himself.<br />The Hippocratic oath, to which the MD psychiatrist subscribes, says above all, do no harm.  Compared with Valium, psychiatry did little harm and the harm it did has to be proven by psychiatric hermeneutics themselves.  Sexual abuse of patients is not this kind of harm since it is malpractice.  Heavily headshrunk people do not appear to be psychotic, and although the sorts of individuals who committ spectacular crimes often have psychiatric histories these appear to be somewhat mandated by previous run-ins with the law, or casual encounters with no follow-through.  The spectacular crimes can be in many cases in recent years ascribed to a lack of follow-through, which is caused by lack of access to Woody Allenesque abilities to talk things through without religious boundaries.<br />The best reason to read this book is to learn about a world destroyed by economics, in which ordinary people of the upper middle class were able to talk to shrinks and convert misery into ordinary unhappiness.  This does not sound like much, but it is better than forced conversion of misery into extreme misery, whether that misery is internal or visited upon the kids.	2000-12-28
US	50358924	R1S51YJZN5RKDK	0735608776	678153780	After the Gold Rush: Creating a True Profession of Software Engineering (DV-Best Practices)	Books	3	35	106	N	N	I'm a software engineer and you're not	Since the 1970s, books like After the Gold Rush have been frequent and unchanging.  They notice that most software is developed using techniques that are apparently what the French call bricolage, rules of thumb rather than the more scientific principles of traditional engineering.  They then urge greater maturity upon software developers.<br />What we need to realize is that software engineering is a science of man.  Its mistake is to transfer the objectification of nature to human behavior, thereby becoming, in Nietzche's sense, a form of truth/power and a tool for domination.<br />C. S. Lewis pointed out that Renaissance science was not so much a tool for the disinterested domination of nature as a magician's tool for the control of people, and shortly after Lewis, Thomas Kuhn confirmed this from within the scientific establishment.  Francis Bacon was not only a disinterested scientist but also heavily involved with the politics of his era and the desire of the Tudor magnates to bring England's people under centralized control.<br />Nonetheless the software engineers believe, by reducing what they regard as the bricolage of the traditional computer programmer and by increasing the use of empirical tools and visual aids, software engineering will then succeed in the manner of traditional engineering.  Power, they believe, will realize truth.<br />In the meantime, however, bricolage has continued to produce success.  Linus Torvaldys' bricolage proved that even operating systems could be fabricated by individuals with no power relations between each other. <br />The praxis of actual computer programmers varies widely.  However, software engineering mavens think it's all bad praxis which, they claim, should be more controllable by \\"normal people\\", defined in America as management, and management-oriented.<br />\\"Normal\\" people seem to be those who more or less willingly adapt to a life structured in detail by power.  To take one example, the \\"normal\\" software developer accepts without discussion the capillary power relation known as \\"going to work\\", involving so often exhausting and meaningless daily drives from point A to point B in order to satisfy the undiscussed proposition that (a) the corporation needs to watch him work, because (b) absent this Panopticon, the employee would immediately assert the converse power relation known as goofing off.  Of course, this misses the very idea, absent as it is from a network of power, that one might like to work.<br />Early programmers developed many techniques that newbies have yet to learn properly.  Programmers were only accidentally members of a guild, and  this \\"priesthood\\" steadily expanded.  New monks may have been occasionally whacked upside the head for their own good, and users demanding the logical equivalent of cold fusion have occasionally been sassed, even when they were CEOs: the disruptive backtalk, not the bricolage, was the real problem.  <br />Instead of a \\"priesthood\\", there was that rarity, the career open to talents.  Programming has long represented \\"some way outa this place\\" to people from broken homes, minorities and women.  But after years of struggle, these folks find social relations unchanged, and they view top-down rhetoric about \\"software engineering\\" with suspicion and hostility.  But because they don't have the tools to organize these thoughts, this becomes a populist programming anti-intellectualism which is part of the problem set, and is marshaled by management to resist Steve's goals.<br />It is simply not likely that even a licensed software engineer will be able to hold up a development project in the way that Steve describes, by refusing to sign off.  Steve takes as frozen and given traditional professional/organization power relationships, including that of the doctor to his hospital or HMO and that of the lawyer to the megafirm, and Steve commits a naturalistic fallacy, for for the same reasons programmers cannot seem to professionalize, doctorsand lawyers are being steadily reduced in power by the same forces programmers face: those of cost accounting and naked authority.  <br />The programmer will always represent a scandal: the scandal he represent is so unspeakable that it only appears in old myths including the Nibelunglied with its account of the relationship of systems (the laboring gods who built the palace of the new gods and who wanted to be paid.)  To be second nature, the administered world has to break this nexus and it has and will use all methods up to and including liquidation of programmers as a class; for example, researchers have found that many \\"programmers\\" spend their days doing anything but writing code. <br />Steve does not have much respect for computer science which to me is closer to original programming praxis and he feels that enrollments are declining in CS because the so-called \\"market\\" of prospective students shrewdly perceive writing compilers and learning graph theory as valueless.  This ignores the fact that this market by definition doesn't know what it needs, and it also ignores the fact that many software products are indeed at some level formal languages.  Their use demands at a mininum an appreciation for what Dijkstra has described as the cruelty of symbolic manipulation.  Their fabrication does indeed involve at various times the writing of compilers and the understanding, at the level of theory, the idea of graphs.<br />The \\"software engineer\\" may very well go to work believing that computer languages from SQL to various fourth and fifth generation proprietary languages are now so powerful that they understand, in the manner of human languages, subtle shades of meaning and all stupid errors.  But these folks will also, courtesy of lack of humanistic culture, fail to grasp just how vast human capability for nondenumerably large shifts in meaning can be.<br />They will be, in other words, modern barbarians of an administered world that will not see what it is about, and that will regard human creations blasphemously as a second form of nature, more controllable by empirical techniques than by logical analysis.  What will result, and what has already resulted, is more domination of man by man, and more \\"I'm a software engineer, and you're a mere coder.\\"  Steve, after Code Complete, I expect more from you.	2000-11-26

Another team effort by a group of specialists in various areas of 17th century philosophy, this book has an underlying disunity, like The Columbia History of Western Philosophy.  It purposely departs from the &quot;great man thinking&quot; tradition of older histories, but this itself is a conscious return to the way a 17th century book would be organized: by subject-matter.<br />Thus we hear not only from Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, but also from their critics and detractors.<br />There is, here, a false and generalized humility.  There is, here, no there, there.<br />For Hegel, the whole point of philosophy was the reflection of absolute reality by a single mind, not a team-mind, not a group-mind.  The fact that absolute knowledge of that great muffin, the World Spirit, was open to all was not taken by Hegel to mean that the knowledge would be collective, and Spinoza's magnificent ending to his essay On Human Freedom, &quot;everything excellent is difficult as it is rare&quot;, states in essence that while it is POSSIBLE for the ordinary slob to grasp what Spinoza is saying, it is also POSSIBLE for any given slob (such as one of Spinoza's correspondents, a singularly unpleasant business man who pestered him with absurd questions) to fail to understand.<br />But the post-modern, &quot;administered&quot; mind feels that the possibility entails the actuality, that the least able and even the least willing will &quot;get it&quot;, and sees a bogus elitism when some members of the team don't &quot;get it.&quot;<br />There is some question as to whether group-knowledge is knowledge at all.<br />It is one thing to partition a field for mere convenience and later presentation of the results in the form that could be grasped by one mind.    <br />It is quite another for the knowledge to be virtual, and to remain in the group.<br />Take a simple example.  A knows B: C knows D.  If this is given, it is not the case that either A or C knows the proposition &quot;B and D.&quot;  But if we fire or otherwise terminate knower *manque* C (or alternatively knower A), the remaining knower works harder but at the end of the day knows more.<br />The most common argument for scholarly specialisation predefines how much an individual can know and also is very pessimistic about the knowers' (and the brains') ability to develop new mechanisms for integrating knowledge as a byproduct of the learning process.  A false humility allows the administered mind to knock off prematurely at the task of knowledge, and play golf, for it is pessimistic about the possibility of a more Hegelian and more absolute, totalizing knowledge.<br />The Cambridge History therefore regresses to the post-mediaeval 17th century in its methodology, and regresses prior to the thinkers covered who at the summit replaced Scholasticism (itself a form of group think) with the in principle ability of the mind to comprehend more than a narrow subject area.  This in principle ability reached its full flower in Kant and its apotheosis in Hegel.<br />The critique of the dead white male approach, in other words, has thrown the baby out with the bath-water.  If 17th century philosophy is presented without the judgement that the guys thinking were of different abilities the student is ultimately confused, and philosophy no longer becomes the optimistic study of ascending progress.  The self-reflexivity of thought entails, however, that once you introduce this pessimism, it becomes self-reinforcing.<br />A certain sourness, a certain nastiness, creeps into overspecialized language.  For example, this book reports a 17th century syllogism, to the effect that all men are white, no Africans are white, and therefore no Africans are men.  It astonished me that this syllogism is presented with no comment about its repugnance, and I speculate that the author and editor decided not to be too &quot;politically correct.&quot;  Far from being a hotbed of liberalism, many universities are hotbeds ofa negative and a fearful conservatism which is anxious not to conform to a (false) caricature.  One wishes that the editor had added a qualification or used a different syllogism.<br />Noam Chomsky has commented on the absence of really good books on scholarly fields for the general public.  His ideal was Lancelot Hogben's book Mathematics for the Million.  In philosophy, especially in his magisterial but outdated History, Lord Russell popularized without becoming superficial.  <br />The intelligent general reader will understand and retain the details in the Cambridge history, and some of the chapters (especially Professor Mahoney's) are good.  It also helps us to see that men did not forget the Scholastic tradition at midnight in the year 1600 and it makes the point also made by Harry Wolfson's study of Spinoza that you can't understand 17th century thought ahistorically.  Spinoza and the other major league hitters were batting balls thrown by men who intellectually were of the 16th century and before (to use a baseball analogy: the editing of my review of the Columbia History made me sound like Yogi Berra, so I may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.)<br />But ultimately the grand narrative is replaced by trivial unanswered questions, such as should Spinoza have gotten married, and settled down.  Or what.	2000-11-06

Unconsciously, Bellow used the ancient aesthetic of the &quot;three unities&quot; in this early novel.  The &quot;three unities&quot; were unity of place (one location), time (the action takes place on a single day), and action (all events contribute to the denoument.)<br />Seize the Day is about one character (Tommy Wilhelm): it takes place in a single day on the upper west side of Manhattan.  All events lead to his doom.  But as Bellow became successful he neglected structure.<br />In Ravelstein, there is no there, here.  Although its protagonist is Ravelstein/Allan Bloom, the most interesting part of the book recounts Bellow's own sufferings as a result of eating tainted fish.  The action ranges widely over time and place for Ravelstein dies in the early 1990s, whereas the writing and the illness take place at the end of the century, and it is for us to decide if Ravelstein's demise has anything to do with Bellow's illness.. The place ranges from Chicago to Paris.<br />A novel is not a classic drama; that is not my point.  But Bellow, even at this late date, needs more structuring principles in his books, which may not even be \\"novels.\\"<br />What, exactly, constitutes a novel?<br />The novel came into its own with the rise of the bourgeois of the 19th century.  Classic novels can be analysed by using political philosophy: John Rawls' 1972 A Theory of Justice.  Rawls departed and continues to depart from today's wisdom which makes the market the adjudicator of justice.  His test is instead what we would choose if we did not know our position in society (an oversimplification for brevity.)<br />The application of Rawls to the 19th century novel is that the point of Dickens et al. was in the continuity of personality over social viscissitudes.  We don't want to know about Dickens' characters' Bleak Houses, but about their souls.  We care about economic changes as they affect the characters in Dickens and Zola because we care about souls, the precipitate after social difference goes away.<br />The audience for Dickens and Zola was diverse.  The middle class of the 19th century had lives of social mobility and struggle as they themselves tried to survive.  They could therefore connect to misadventures in novels.  Dickens and Zola also appealed to a variety of social classes, again because of the mobility of their characters.<br />Whereas in modern American fiction economic place is definitional and for the most part unchanging as an engine of the plot.  Stephen King readers want to read about lower-middle class people.  Bellow's readers want a high-class Stephen King, in which the high-class reader is reassured by products (such as original instruments CDs) which code the milieu described, in the same way that monsters in the K Mart both comfort and titillate the reader of Stephen King.<br />Ravelstein enters with a fatal disease and wealthy as the result of publishing a book and Bellow seems to want to show how a free man dies.  Ravelstein's change, from health to sickness and debt to wealth, is only prologue.<br />Chick/Bellow likewise, as a result of his health insurance and financial success, as well as the ministrations of his nth wife Rosamund, is able to survive a normally fatal case of food poisoning.<br />How nice for them, we think, but how does this concern us?<br />What we do not see is how these characters, from Tommy Wilhelm to Ravelstein to Chick, would react to changes, and the externals of tenure, money and health insurance are givens.<br />This does not constitute a novel in the 19th century sense, when novels appealed to many different social classes because their authors had an eye for many different ways of life.<br />Bellow has no such eye.  In Bellow, the University of Chicago is the only clean, well-lit, place, surrounded by jungle boogie from which &quot;the cops&quot; (those fonts of wisdom) warn the eggheads away.  <br />This is an ethical/aesthetic decline from older American fiction, similar to the decline from the time of Virgil in Roman literature to that of Trimalchio.  <br />We care about Frank Norris' repulsive McTeague as he loses his profession, wins (with his wife) the lottery, steals the loot, and ends up in Death Valley.  But it's clear that the interesting fact about Ravelstein is that he's &quot;free&quot; in the economic sense and highly intelligent.  Silas Lapham was brought to you by Silas Lapham: Ravelstein is brought to you by Bear Stearns and other keepers of his credit.  Hamlet practically writes Hamlet, according to a different Bloom: Ravelstein is written by Morgan Stanley.<br />We follow Aeneas through his adventures, primarily the Dido nonsense, because we care about Aeneas, not his position in Troy or in Rome.  But the ONLY interesting thing about Trimalchio is that he gives his friends a feast.  We would not care to follow Trimalchio were he to be taken by pirates or convert to Christianity because we don't like him very much.  We would not care to follow Ravelstein into a deathbed conversion to born-again Christianity for the same reason.<br />Modern American fiction is anti-Rawls, and locates character in external fortune.  This may be why \\"unsuccessful\\" Americans are unable to cohently narrate their day, let alone their lives.  In the writings of the unspeakable Tom Wolfe the character becomes the Turnbull and Asser shirt.  Lifestyles and the market replace souls, and gone is the capacity, outside the market, for laughter and surprise.  <br />Craft is also disappearing, replaced by smirks: vast zones of Chicago are replaced by their racial coding, received secondhand from the cops (those fonts of wisdom.)  <br />Even the details are off.  On the next to last page of the book, Ravelstein is obviously listening to Giacomo Rossini, unaccountably described as played on original 17th-century instruments when Rossini worked in the 19th century.  More generally, no real link is made between Ravelstein's death and Bellow's sufferings, although the latter are described grippingly.  There is no there, here, only the market.	2000-10-25

While this is an excellent and sensitive overview of the history of computer science from a critical standpoint, it may miss the essential point.<br />This is that while the announced intention of Cold War data systems efforts was to indeed provide a logically closed structure that would ensure national security and a narrow form of economic growth (which excluded unions from power), as Edwards himself reveals, these systems in significant ways failed to accomplish their technical goals.<br />The problem is that people with the traditional liberal suspicion of computers miss either this fact or fail to grasp its significance.  Edwards fails to grasp its significance.<br />What it means is that on the ground, in the apparently highly controlled mainframe computer rooms, a highly &quot;open&quot; and possibly even &quot;green&quot; for of chaos operated as software (in one noted example) bayed at the moon when it mistook the moon for a missile.  This chaos was presented as its opposite in a rhetorical trick which conceals the labor, and in some cases the very existence, of software creation.  <br />The troubling fact, invisible to humanists outside the field, is that the upper-level administrators of these systems did not really care that they did not work, as long as the public viewed them as a closed and working system.  They'd also prefer to conceal the origins of the software that controls these systems in labor and in writing.<br />Edwards in the main fails to link this rhetorical sleight-of-hand to C. Wright Mills' work in which the general public is systematically deceived, and a white-collar class creates the tools of its own destruction.  <br />The Sage air defense system did not work and did not, in fact, protect the United States from attack: what protected us from attack was the decision of men to back down from macho and nuclear-armed confrontation, including Eisenhower's decision to not back Britain, France and Israel in 1956's Suez crisis and Nikita Krushchev's decision to back down in 1962 over Cuba.<br />The real technical illusion is not that the closed world is &quot;better than&quot; the green world.  It is to not fully close digital worlds but to present them as closed, and to prevent the rules of their closure from public oversight, and control.	2000-10-16
US	50358924	R1RBUTU3YTB6JP	0385720270	814405181	Development as Freedom	Books	5	19	29	N	N	How to argue with the right on economics	People who object to laissez-faire economics are forced into &quot;irrationality&quot;: either ungrounded identity politics or equally ungrounded to notions of equality and fair play.<br />Amaryta Sen rebuilds the ability to argue with laissez-faire for he demonstrates how to introduce notions of human equality and fair play.  But Sen doesn't get trapped into arguing for fair play and equality as such.  <br />The turn of the century philosopher G. E. Moore tried to establish that &quot;the good&quot; in ethics is a given and came close to arguing for a laundry list of good and beautiful notions.  As such, Moore was the spiritual father of the &quot;Cambridge Apostles&quot;, a group of Englishmen whose left-liberal world-view grandfathered the American liberal consensus of the post-war period.<br />The 1960s *reductio* of this consensus, inspired by the media, destroyed it and created an opening for laissez-faire.  It took the permissiveness of liberalism to imply that a selfish world  was one of the views sanctioned by liberalism and this was a real contradiction that destroyed liberalism.<br />This means that appeals to selfishness have great rhetorical force in American domestic politics, and their force is amplified in international economics: for example, many Americans believe that the United States gives billions of dollars away in foreign aid, and should not, whereas the reality is that about 1% of the budget is earmarked for such aid, and the United States is a deadbeat dad with regards to an institution it helped to parent, the United Nations, and behind in its dues.<br />We therefore need conceptual tools to counter lazy laissez-faire.  The technique should neither be, in the matter of G. E. Moore, to merely claim the primacy of the good, nor to try to construct elaborate &quot;proofs&quot; in the manner of mathematics that it is better to be nice and good (for note that \\"it is better to be good\\" is equivalent to \\"it is good to be good\\", and this is a tautology, and Moore noticed it, and one sometimes wonder if philosophers are up to anything worth while, at all.)<br />Instead, Sen demonstrates the worth of international economic solidarity by means of the facts and by building a structure that is logically coherent, and which coherence tracks its sustainability.  Pure laissez-faire self-destructs because there is no way of curbing the appetites of the bigger players, and preventing them from using force and fraud.  Their force and fraud is met with desparate resistance which amplifies the process leading to a non-sustainable situation.<br />Sen shows mechanisms, both economic and conceptual, which lead both to logical coherence and sustainability.  He suggests replacing econometrics which more complicated measures of the quality of life, but Sen does not fall into a sort of Stalinist trap.  This is to REPLACE the measures agreed on in the current consensus (notably income per capita) with another simple-minded measure, perhaps compounded in a fashion more or less arbitrary out of sub measures.<br />The economists fetishize and reify measures and do not see, for example, the results of inequality which are concealed by average income per capita.  If there are two men on an island (Robinson Crusoe and Friday) and one of them enjoys an income of ALL the breadfruit on the island and the other (guess who) enjoys the status of slave, with right to zero breadfruit trees, then the average income is one-half the breadfruit trees.  This presents that old harlot, and mother of harlots, Rosy Scenario, to the economist, blinded as he is by spreadsheets.<br />But Sen does not fall into the trap of replacing spreadsheets by sob stories, although he presents some sob stories about real misery in countries that present Rosy Scenarios to development economists.  His narratives INCLUDE and do not include the numbers.<br />But they use the numbers in a less simple-minded way.  Even a laissez-faire American businessman would be ill-advised to run his company by looking at one number and one number alone.  The businessman who looked ONLY at quarterly net profit would not see how his employees were running down equipment in order to meet his singular target, resulting in later failure to meet the chosen target.  <br />For note that if we feed the numbers (such as the higher rate of loan repayment by poor women) into narratives informed by an unquestioned committment to equality and justice, this automatically prevents both our being blinded by injustices hidden by single, utilitarian, numbers, and it also has the side-benefit of preventing some forms of fraud, as the fraudulent numbers fail to cohere with the honest numbers, and the honest narratives.<br />The cynicism of laissez-faire economics hides a naivety which has been regularly exposed, in the international debt arena, by the fraudulent misappropropriation of loans for consumption instead of development.  For example, American economists went naively into the former Soviet Union believing in capitalism as a sort of god that would magically bring prosperity to that country.  Like farm boys, like hicks, like yokels, they were taken for a ride by the former Communist *nomenklatura*, which simply appears to have grabbed the money and used it to empty the Black Sea of caviar.  They were supposed to invest it in a new infrastructure to replace the presumably out-of-date Communist rust belt.  They said they were gonna and did not.<br />This is causing an unprecedented phenomenon: the reversion of a developed country to Third World status.  This was caused by the imposition of a development model.<br />Economists are often wrong: for example, Sen points out just how wrong Malthus was.  Condorcet's prediction, that better living conditions would bring the benefits of Enlightenment to the poor, causing them to refrain from irrationally having large families, has, as Sen points out, been proven right by recent developments.  But Malthus is accounted asone of the &quot;worldly philosophers&quot; and his spirit, if not his exact ideas, pervades much Yuppie thinking in America.  It is a nasty and narrow spirit; read Sen for a set of tools to argue for the better way.	2000-10-13

For Said, as he relates, grew up in a milieu in which intellect was, at one and the same time, respected and despised.<br />The law of non-contradiction is a grownup's artifact: the child's world, whether that of Theodore Adorno as related is Minima Moralia, or Said, is more dialectical, which is why, perhaps, inabilities to take on the adult task of either reconciling, putting up with or acknowledging real contradictions is often misdiagnosed and mistreated as schizophrenia.  Adorno and Said saw all too clearly the hypocrisy of a private school system which consistently blamed victims and used the physical hierarchy of smaller and weaker boys versus stronger boys as a tacit way of reinforcing the system of the masters.  <br />Said showed how silly it is to respect a man like George Bush for a Yale degree when at the time Bush attended Yale, Said attended Princeton, and today, the elite students did not really have to become truly educated if they did not want to do so.<br />Heroically, Said took what he needed and left the rest.  Princeton was in part merely the capstone of a series of silly schools, but Said saw that he could use the resources of teachers like RP Blackmur to attain his own goals, which Said has fulfilled admirably.  Princeton has changed owing to the 1960s and the greater presence of women and minorities, but tweedy anti-intellectualism is alive and well there still: a member of its Council of Humanities once expressed fear that his auto mechanic would read James Joyce.<br />Too many Americans, commencing with Harry Truman, take a costless road when it comes to display their tolerance, and that is unreflective support for Israel.Truman was after all concerned with re-engineering the party of Southern racism into a modern party, able to keep and retain national office.  It was easier for Truman to recognize Israel than to end American racism, despite the fact that Israel has an earned right to exist and to flourish which has been ackowledged by public intellectuals from Said to Jean-Paul Sartre.  Truman's thoughtless act (not compared to Germany's 1991 recognition of Croatia, which was condemned) was part of the never-ending and misnamed Middle Eastern &quot;peace process&quot; which Said has been able to not only describe as a public intellectual but also from the inside.<br />For if indeed the only deserving victims are people that Americans recognize as real, the Christian and Moslem Arabs of Lebanon were genuine people who worked hard (Said's father, Wadie Said, invented the Arabic typewriter, and was thus a forerunner of computer software internationalization) and wanted their children to have a better life.  At some cost, Said has described a world that was destroyed by clowns like Balfour who deliberately oversimplify ethnic situations by forcing combinatoric richness into monocultural molds in which real people get killed...for being one of the numerous mathematical permutations of Moslem and Christian, Serb and Croatian, which are perceived, idiotically, as &quot;less than&quot; a mythic purity.<br />The discourse of people like Edward Said is often referred to as overly complex, confusing, as if Said had set out to obfuscate.  There is something amusing, if sad, about the role reversal that takes place.  Extreme and simplified positions, whether Arab fundamentalist or Israeli hard line, take upon themselves personality and life, like the class bully whose humanity is fully narrated by the masters as somehow more virile...more human.  Actual attention to the myriad details of real life becomes the characteristic of the pedant, in somewhat the same way Americans narrate computer andmath skills as &quot;nerdly.&quot;<br />The marginalized are forced to oversimplify their message with the result that their representatives become as bad as their persecutors: Said narrates the evolution of a scholarly and avuncular childhood mentor who became complicit with the massacre of Moslems at the Shatila and other refugee camps in 1982, in the name of his reified Christian Arab minority's rights not to be persecuted in turn.<br />One can only speculate what would happen if a politician genuinely appreciated, and narrated, the actual complexities.  Our Constitution does make some space for this in separation of powers but it is continually under attack by a growing infantile strain in our politics which pretends to be frustrated by wordy politicians (while ordinary people watch CSpan's wordy and unedited debates with fascination.)<br />Edward Said's memoir may encourage readers to tackle his more forbidding works of literary criticism and political theory.  I was a member of the audience at Chicago's Art Institute when he delivered a talk on how political ontologies, especially Orientalism, are generated by cultural artifacts, and Out of Place makes it clear how he was positioned to see this in Cairo as the member of a partly Anglicised and later partly Americanized *haute* bourgeois.  In response to one of my questions, Edward advised the audience to avoid overlay narrow experts who are literally ignorant of culture.  He grew up seeing all too clearly how the Western view of him was manufactured by cheap films as well as the pomposities of men in diplomatic circles, and as a member of My Generation, he's spoken out.<br />It is true that at the end of the day, one would rather be Out of Place, and to narrate the story, in Einstein's phrasing, &quot;as simply as possible, but no simpler.&quot;  We after all live in a country where politicians do not speak at all about a real American anti-Semitism that is coded but real in Pat Buchanan's discourse, and evenin speech about &quot;nerds.&quot;  We instead take cheap poses in favor of extreme anti-Arabism that most reflective Israelis reject.  Reading Said is refreshing in this context.	2000-09-20
US	50358924	R1ZJOXZCHA18VA	0679429832	586137837	Inside the Sky: A Meditation on Flight	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A German philosopher in the air?	Some of the puzzlement generated by this book and expressed in the reviews  may be generated by the fact of Langewiesche's genre.<br />I'd characterize it  as &quot;the critical philosophy of the artisan.&quot;<br />In American  culture, people don't reflect deeply on their trade, profession, or career  except as how to get ahead, unless they are talking to Studs Terkel.<br />But  in many societies, people do.  In societies where &quot;mere&quot; trades  have more respect, the artisan often creates his own relationship with the  tools of his trade.  An example from general philosophy is Heidegger's  craftsman.<br />As Langewiesche points out with regards to the patterns in  which working air traffic controllers and their managers fall, it's not the  norm to reflect on the truth of one's trade.  The truth is, at one and the  same time, that Reagan and FAA management was out to screw Patco, and that  after the mass firing of 1981, management, as Langewiesche describes, was  able to take over.<br />It is impossible for either a controller or a member  of management to actually enunciate this complex truth because to do so  would disadvantage the side, in an adversary relationship.<br />Another way  Langewiesche engages truth as an artisan philosopher is with regards to  fear of flying, often caused from a lack of knowledge of the passenger's  physical relationship to the world.  As Langewiesche describes, commercial  aviation operates within tight safety and comfort parameters which  effectively assure that any one flight is more safe, not only as compared  to driving...but even as compared to sitting in your living room watching  TV.  This is probably especially true if the person in the living room is  the normal gun owner (sorry, I just could not resist this.)<br />At the same  time, Langewiesche's committment to truth is such that he describes how  this effective assurance is not a necessary truth.  It is possible that  fear of flying, like much thinking of an addictive nature, can only be  analyzed using modal logic: the logic, that is, of statements which are  necessarily true (true in all possible worlds) or only contingently true  (true in our world but it could be otherwise.)<br />The alcoholic realizes in  AA when he or she is &quot;Powerless&quot; that their alcoholism is not an  accidental, empirical fact, like a possibly cancerous mole which can be  excised, and cured.  He may realize that his alcoholism is a necessary  truth about his existence.<br />The fearful flyer (who is often beset with  addiction issues) wants a similar guarantee of safety and as Langewiesche  shows we can approach this without ever completely assuring safety as a  necessary truth.  To want it is perhaps to want to be god.<br />In recent  years, passenger cabins, formerly under higher fares the abode of the  well-dressed and well-behaved, have become snake pits as, perhaps, the  passengers insist on a trouble-free experience in which they are the  god-consumer of our society.  A pilot friend put it simply to me recently,  &quot;the passengers are pigs, we just shut the door on them and let the  flight attendants do crowd control.&quot;  Research is called for on the  relationship of air travel to addictive thinking, if only for the safety of  the attendants.  Perhaps airlines should be booze-free as well as smoke  free.<br />Fearful flyers would do well to read this book for it provides in  the main comfort.  I want an artisan to reflect deeply on his trade, and  Langewiesche like his father before him (an authority on flight in the  postwar period) fill this need.<br />Langewiesche reminds me of the early  Wittgenstein, who wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.  This is because  Wittgenstein wrote in the Tractatus that when the problems of science are  answered we have the feeling that the problems of life are not addressed.   Having gone through the checklists the pilot remains human and reflects on  the meaning of it all.  To the averageAmerican this is unnecessary.  To  me, it makes you a better artisan as well as a better person.	2000-09-12

There is an unresolved tension between the fact that without  a script there is no movie, and the real need for a superstructure of  direction, marketing, finance and distribution: there is an unresolved  tension between the central role of software and the real need for an even  vaster superstructure.  <br />The dream of the Forbes and the Vanity Fair  crowd is thus one of expropriation.  Hmm, the nerds produced most of the  wealth in the last twenty years while our crowd did little more than trash  the New Yorker.  Time to acknowledge their skills, and show them the  door...unless, of course, they can reinvent themselves as one of us (to be  fair, we live in an open society where this is possible.)<br />Po Bronson did  his homework and understands much about technology: but his overall  approach is to bring gasp and glam to an area of the economy which used to  be a refuge from the Jet Set, Forbes and Vanity Fair.<br />There are revealing  misunderstandings in this book: for example, Bronson confuses &quot;egoless  programming&quot; with deference to senior team members, where the inventor  of the term, Gerald Weinberg, made it clear in his book THE PSYCHOLOGY OF  COMPUTER PROGRAMMING that egoless programming is deference not to people  but to software correctness. Weinberg explicitly stated in his 1972 work  that senior people were as likely to defer to the judgement of junior  people as the reverse.<br />What Po Bronson does not get is that  &quot;cyberspace&quot; has to be about something outside cyberspace.  In  his world, there is cyberspace and there is people, but nothing so  invisible as the correctness of a piece of software.  Gerald Weinberg's  main concern, in introducing the concept of egoless programming, was  avoiding software bugs, but it is impossible to define a bug with precision  if you've lost the capability to consider problems outside of computer  code.<br />But, of course, Po speaks neither to mathematicians nor  technicians, but to glamerati: the personality-obsessed readers of Vanity  Fair.  The glamerati take an interest in technology today because, as the  bank robber said, that's where the money is.  The glamerati, under Reagan,  deindustrialized the Rust Belt for a combination of good reasons, bad  reasons, and no reason at all.  High tech is the only sector showing a  pulse, so high tech attracts the best and brightest.  Naturally the wealthy  kids are now attracted to careers as glam software developers...at least  until they try to debug their first C program (as the saying goes, how to  debug your first C program: change your major.)  <br />The Beautiful People,  in so doing, resemble nothing so much as decaying British aristocrats of  the 19th century, trying to marry off their daughters to mill owners and  receiving Trade in Society.  <br />As a result the phenomenon of technical  inversion became the default in the valley: the phenomenon of the sales and  glam oriented manager giving lectures on technology to subordinates who  know more than him, or her.<br />Beyond this, in Po's world, being a digerati  involves what a programmer would call a highly non-encapsulated and  non-modular acceptance of a package deal.  Instead of picking and choosing  between views, &quot;being digital&quot; (in Negroponte's ugly phrase)  means a nonstop positivism about everything digital and either the  disappearance of the critical faculty, or its direction solely on targets  such as government and labor.  <br />It's all very well to be optimistic.  But  American positivism is the folk philosophy that to criticise technology is  to be a Luddite, even when the technology is wrong.  <br />Furthermore,  &quot;being digital&quot; involves the acceptance of libertarianism's  hostility to the poor and to government.  Historically, this ignores the  invention of computer science on the government's, and the taxpayer's,  dime.  But technology is politically neutral and it silently and without  appeal exerts a level of control over our lives that unlike government  control cannot be challenged EXCEPT by the invention of technical  alternatives.  <br />That is, people with a beef with society and/or their  position have been encouraged since the early 1980s to invent a better  mousetrap, start a company, as ersatz for social change.  This is very  positivistic for it replaces &quot;negative criticism.&quot;  <br />But  positivism, by replacing relations with things, fails to take  responsibility for networks...with the result that in actual application,  technology has serious problems with issues of correctness and  maintainability.  For every two new things a and b, a third non-thing with  reality pops up, and that is the relation between a and b.  Now, this stuff  is pretty boring at cocktail parties and beer blasts, and it has a positive  side in that it generates aftermarkets (interfacing of Web pages with  legacy data) at warp speed.  But the lack of responsibility for the whole  is socially fragmenting and leads to a pervading sense of  powerlessness.<br />The title of this book implants the idea that computer  programmers are rich and completely in control of their working lives.  Inactuality, working in high tech is quite brutal and literally  schizophregenic (productive, that is, of schizophrenia): for at one and the  same time it asserts control but needs to be subordinated to management  ends.  For a good book about the realities of high tech, read instead Ellen  Ullman's book CLOSE TO THE MACHINE.	2000-08-31

Weinberg explicitly stated in his 1972 work  that senior people were as likely to defer to the judgement of junior  people as the reverse.<br />What Po Bronson does not get is that  &quot;cyberspace&quot; has to be about something outside cyberspace.  In  his world, there is cyberspace and there is people, but nothing so  invisible as the correctness of a piece of software.  Gerald Weinberg's  main concern, in introducing the concept of egoless programming, was  avoiding software bugs, but it is impossible to define a bug with precision  if you've lost the capability to consider problems outside of computer  code.<br />But, of course, Po speaks neither to mathematicians nor  technicians, but to glamerati: the personality-obsessed readers of Vanity  Fair.  The glamerati take an interest in technology today because, as the  bank robber said, that's where the money is.  The glamerati, under Reagan,  deindustrialized the Rust Belt for a combination of good reasons, bad  reasons, and no reason at all.  High tech is the only sector showing a  pulse, so high tech attracts the best and brightest.  Naturally the wealthy  kids are now attracted to careers as glam software developers...at least  until they try to debug their first C program (as the saying goes, how to  debug your first C program: change your major.)  <br />The Beautiful People,  in so doing, resemble nothing so much as decaying British aristocrats of  the 19th century, trying to marry off their daughters to mill owners and  receiving Trade in Society.  <br />As a result the phenomenon of technical  inversion became the default in the valley: the phenomenon of the sales and  glam oriented manager giving lectures on technology to subordinates who  know more than him, or her.<br />Beyond this, in Po's world, being a digerati  involves what a programmer would call a highly non-encapsulated and  non-modular acceptance of a package deal.  Instead of picking and choosing  between views, &quot;being digital&quot; (in Negroponte's ugly phrase)  means a nonstop positivism about everything digital and either the  disappearance of the critical faculty, or its direction solely on targets  such as government and labor.  <br />It's all very well to be optimistic.  But  American positivism is the folk philosophy that to criticise technology is  to be a Luddite, even when the technology is wrong.  <br />Furthermore,  &quot;being digital&quot; involves the acceptance of libertarianism's  hostility to the poor and to government.  Historically, this ignores the  invention of computer science on the government's, and the taxpayer's,  dime.  But technology is politically neutral and it silently and without  appeal exerts a level of control over our lives that unlike government  control cannot be challenged EXCEPT by the invention of technical  alternatives.  <br />That is, people with a beef with society and/or their  position have been encouraged since the early 1980s to invent a better  mousetrap, start a company, as ersatz for social change.  This is very  positivistic for it replaces &quot;negative criticism.&quot;  <br />But  positivism, by replacing relations with things, fails to take  responsibility for networks...with the result that in actual application,  technology has serious problems with issues of correctness and  maintainability.  For every two new things a and b, a third non-thing with  reality pops up, and that is the relation between a and b.  Now, this stuff  is pretty boring at cocktail parties and beer blasts, and it has a positive  side in that it generates aftermarkets (interfacing of Web pages with  legacy data) at warp speed.  But the lack of responsibility for the whole  is socially fragmenting and leads to a pervading sense of  powerlessness.<br />The title of this book implants the idea that computer  programmers are rich and completely in control of their working lives.  Inactuality, working in high tech is quite brutal and literally  schizophregenic (productive, that is, of schizophrenia): for at one and the  same time it asserts control but needs to be subordinated to management  ends.  For a good book about the realities of high tech, read instead Ellen  Ullman's book CLOSE TO THE MACHINE.	2000-08-30
US	50358924	R13NVLBGSH548B	0415902002	406376336	Words of Power: A Feminist Reading of the History of Logic (Thinking Gender)	Books	5	16	43	N	N	An important book: obtain it if you can	As a part-time, occasional university teacher and full time software  developer who has taught logic, I found Ms Nye's work very useful in  livening up my classes. It is a shame that it does not seem to be  available. <br />Nye's thesis: the actual praxis of logic has been a struggle  for power between men and not a disinterested search for truth.  It will be  said by many philosophers that she is doing history...not logic. <br />However,  a reading of Indian indicates to me two interesting facts. The first is  that only in the western tradition do philosophers suppose that logic can  be studied out of context.  Indian logicians appear to emphasise the  importance of context: in their tradition (according to my limited  understanding) you do not introduce the axiom &quot;when there's smoke,  there's fire&quot; without illustrating its context as in &quot;when  there's smoke, there's fire, as in the kitchen.&quot; <br />In the western  tradition, this is marginalia. This is probably why logic seems so dry and  so difficult and why its anhedonic (anti-pleasure) nature instills an  unacknowledged anger in its mostly male followers...an anger which Ms Nye  shows resulted in debates that were more struggles for power than searches  for truth, and which also result in Internet &quot;flame&quot; wars and the  obscenities of modern American politics. <br />Ms Nye recommends in place of  logic training in reading and in listening. I used her suggestions in a  recent class in a working-class university, to I hope positive effect.  <br />The traditional philosophical riposte to her desire to replace formal  logic by the apparently woolier skills of reading and listening is that  reading and listening depends for coherence and understanding on logic  itself, and this is supposed to show that logic itself is logically prior  to reading and listening. I first saw this riposte used by my old and  honored teacher, E. D. Klemke, in a debate in 1969 with Northwestern's  Henry Veatch:Veatch claimed that there are &quot;two logics.&quot; <br />In  &quot;proving&quot; that &quot;there is one and only one logic, and I am  its prophet&quot;, Klemke showed that the logic of reading and listening  depends, on his view, on such propositions as p v ~p (any statement is true  or false)...part of logic. <br />This seemed to me at the time conclusive, and  I thought of it when I read Nye in 1990: but further reading in  deconstruction and critical theory has persuaded me of a different way out  of the impasse presented by professors Klemke and Veatch in 1969.  This is  seen in the keyword &quot;logically prior&quot;: if what is at issue is the  status of logic, then Veatch and later Nye are not the only ones committing  the fallacy of petitio principii when they unconsciously use the logic  reified by Bertrand Russel as p v ~P: for the very effort to determine the  logical priority assumes that logical priority exists and is a Good Thing.  <br />Derrida shows us a way out of this impasse by deconstructing the folly  of attempting to categorize language into speech and writing, and  prioritize speech. I can I believe use his method to indicate that critical  listening and symbolic logic are probably two tokens for the same type, and  because the underlying type (*arche*-logic, following Derrida's  *arche*-writing) is a type it may have no proper name. Just as it is  nonsense to make writing logically subordinate to speech when in remote  societies, oral traditions play the logical role of writing, it is nonsense  to debate the worth of a reified symbolic logic versus the praxis of  critical reading, writing and speech. <br />Therefore I felt no compunction  about using Nye's critique of the male history of logic. I do not interpret  Nye as wanting to censor the use of symbolic logic in praxis, only to  remove it from a false enthronement. <br />One reason for this is first-hand  witness of the way in which reification of a technical and mathematical  approach to logic can actually damage its very application: many computer  projects using formal methods, especially formal methods imposed from on  high, become nonproductive simply because of alienation. <br />Nye is correct:  logic in its final perfection is insane for it is no longer contextualised  in human praxis, it has become an isolated infernal machine in which we can  change the axioms (or the program) to obtain the desired result. The  computerized state is NOT the old liberal nightmare of complete  inflexibility: instead, ungrounded flexibility treats all propositions as  equivalent and undermines local authority and the mentoring of the young.  Our society is dominated, as Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig points out  in CODE AND OTHER LAWS OF CYBERSPACE, by out of control logic in the form  of code which increasingly structures our lives according to an invisible,  random, and ever-changing will. <br />We need to critique its mindless,  mechanical, and anti-human application...which is self-refuting and  self-defeating, for the very liberty to change the axioms means that in  actual practice, there is very little discipline among the development of  logic-in-the-form-of-software, only subservience to authority. <br />Logic in  its final perfection has realized the dimly apprehended dreams of the 19th  century proto-symbolic logicians Boole and Jevons, for their research had  led them into an increasingly externalized and technological direction, in  the form of machines for doing simple logic. But in so doing, in  Heidegger's language, it has transformed logic into standing reserve  isolated in computer software. <br />The result in everyday discourse has been  that logic (and the conservative hotbutton, the word &quot;reason&quot;)  has become spectral, a ghost that can be invoked only by name and not in  use. On radio talk shows and the internet, it is thought that the very  emphasis of liberalism on compassion is not &quot;logic&quot; and the name  of reason and logic is frequently invoked against the content of  compassion. But in so doing, the callers and posters frequently repeat the  entire canon of informal and formal fallacies, including ad hominem and  misapplied modus tollens. Precisely because logic has become a spectre, the  callers and posters have frequent difficulty actually using it.	2000-08-18

The media systematically distorts rural populism, trying to show it as a right-wing, conservative phenomenon, which the high-clawss thinkers will  reject with a genteel shudder.<br />It wants us to forget the left-wing roots  of rural populism in the pre-WWI Industrial Workers of the World (the  Wobblies) and in William Jenning's Bryan's crusade against America's entry  into WWI, which is forgotten while his senile buffoonery at the Scopes  &quot;monkey trial&quot; is remembered.<br />It wants rural people to blame  abortion and evolution for very real problems, among them stunning levels  of poverty and unemployment which contrast the good times in the big  cities.<br />Rural people are no fools and they know that their interests are  being ignored.  Along comes Jim and says what's on their minds...far better  than Pat Buchanan.<br />Jim served as a Texas agriculture commissioner, and  you may never eat another hamburger if you read his book.  In a clear style  Jim shows us how in the interests of profit, beef producers force the cows  into the unnatural act of cannibalism.  Part of the reason for the human  prohibition of cannibalism as an &quot;unnatural act&quot; may be actual  experience of the consequences which include transmission of disease,  notably Mad Cow disease.<br />Jim shows how we are being lulled by the public  relations of the beef boys into thinking we are being protected from Mad  Cow disease but we aren't.  To this day, armadillos and roadkill become  cowfeed thanks to rendering so that our meat, while tasteless and  unhealthy, is cheap.<br />Jim shows how you can be an environmentalist and a  farmer or rancher at the same time, for the methods agribusiness uses  manage to be both environmentally hazardous and against the interests of  both small farmers and ranchers and their hired hands, who have to work  while being sprayed with concoctions over which they have no control.<br />As  a philosophical city boy who is currently living in the valley of the Snake  River in Idaho, I reject the sort of disunity created by the media, in  which I get to be the sort of dude who rejects the country boys as a bunch  of ignoramuses.  These sort of oppositions are the problem.  I look less to  the fact that I don't want to hunt and far more to the fact that I share  with the good old boys a love for the land.<br />The only place where Jim goes  off the rails is as regards the H1-B visa program.  This is a program which  allows computer programmers and other high tech workers into the States.   Jim agrees with older American programmers that their skills are going  unused.<br />As a software developer of thirty years standing, I completely  disagree.  My own personal experience is that except in recessions, there  is no age discrimination in my industry IF the employee is willing to keep  up.  There is a lot of racism in high tech, however.  There is also a lot  of sex discrimination against older women of my generation who (motivated  by 1960s feminism of high quality) decided to go against the grain and  become programmers and engineers, because younger men in high tech seem to  be threatened by someone who looks like their hippie Mom and can write  code.  But older white males in my experience for the most part need to  unlearn Cobol and learn Visual Basic and Java.<br />In general, computer  programmers are part of the working class to whom Jim speaks.  But they  should realize that their work is not the same as sheepherding or factory  labor.  It's part of the overall structure of control that keeps working  people in their place, since in part the computer is a public relations  device that (by the clarity of the printouts and the screens) justifies  unfairness.  <br />It's also intrinsically mathematical and intrinsically  difficult.  American programmers as working people are justifiably angry  but unfortunately they express this anger in an inappropriate  anti-intellectualism which suspects even good ideas ifthey come from on  high.  Unfortunately, it's a fact of life that precisely because the upper  classes have the leisure, good ideas do, for the most part, come from on  high.<br />Because of a different tradition of better respect for thought,  Indian and Russian programmers tend to be better at their jobs in my own  experience.  I've spent thirty years chasing down idiotic bugs, many of  which result from sheer anti-intellectualism (&quot;this will never happen,  and it's stupid to think deeply about it, because thinking is such hard  work.&quot;)  I welcome foreign programmers.  I'd like H1-B to be replaced  by fully open borders such as the world had before WWI, where I can work  wherever I want.<br />This is a minor issue which I write about as a  professional concern.  What American farm workers, programmers, and  autoworkers need is not a futile effort to close our borders and become a  tinpot paradise with the likes of Pat Buchanan bawling from the roof of the  White House. The name for this kind of society is Fascism, and it produces  war.<br />What America needs is more guys like Jimbo.  To me, he is a  representative of &quot;civil society&quot;: intelligent and good men and  women who are one level below the Beltway crowd and the slobs like Rush at  the apex of the media: the sort of men who attend mainstream churches and  attend to their families: the sort of guys who don't stab you in the back.   In other countries their ilk is represented by Ms. Aun Soon Yi of  Burma/Myanmar, and orchestra leader Kurt Masur of Germany, who stepped up  in 1989 when Erich Honecker looked to shoot down demonstrators.  I will  look for Jimbo's radio program and read his next book.	2000-08-03

It now  ships manuals on CD and is moving towards placing documentation on the Web,  and its help systems are difficult to use.  Microsoft deserves thanks from  the trees that surround its Pacific Northwest headquarters for not printing  manuals, but the new modes of documentation can be difficult to use and  distracting.<br />So it's hard to select books on Visual Basic because of the  number of offerings.<br />I recommend this book because it's inexpensive and  earth-friendly, being printed on lower-grade, apparently recycled  newsprint.  Don't worry about the permanence of the paper, for it is likely  that Visual Basic 7 will render this book useful as a door stopper, or as  an anchor for a very small boat. <br />You won't curl up with this baby and  read it from cover to cover (unless you're even stranger than me.)  It is  instead a good book to keep at the office.  I recently used it to call the  Windows Registry API interface and this book worked fine.  <br />The Internet  is somewhat overkill for, for example, finding out the syntax of an API  call, for the hyperdimensional quality of the Internet, combined with a low  span of attention, finds the programmer, who just wanted to find out why  his DLL is not registered, scanning [...] instead.  An old  fashioned book without much glamour helps to focus on the task at hand,  known in some circles as work, and in others as RTFM (Read The Fool  Manual.)<br />One issue is the anonymity of the authors.  I do hope that this  is not a trend.  People like to form an image of the author of a book and  SOMEBODY wrote this.  If it is a bunch of guys in Belarus, let us know who  they are.  Everybody deserves his 15 minutes of fame.	2000-07-29
US	50358924	R1X4RPF2B60PVO	0385493622	603019861	Fermat's Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World's Greatest Mathematical Problem	Books	4	0	14	N	N	Fairly good for the general reader	Since mathematics books cannot presume that the general audience knows much about mathematics, this author, to his credit, gives all of the prehistory and the history of Fermat's problem before describing the historic proof by Andrew Wiles.<br />Unavoidably, however, these histories are  infected by a certain bias in favor of narrating the history of mathematics  as the history of Great Men.<br />For this reason, Singh presents Pythagoras  as a demigod...despite accounts of barbaric behavior by  Pythagoras.<br />What's missing is the account of mathematics written by a  French mathematical collective of the 1960s, Bourbaki.  Bourbaki narrated a  history of mathematics which acknowledges that in a sense Pythagoras,  Euclid, and the other Great Mathematicians built not only on their named  predecessors but also on what the Greeks might call &quot;praxis&quot;:  everyday life in which anonymous people created mathematics in order to  solve problems.<br />Because of this, Singh essentially indoctrinates the  reader into a world view that looks down on practice and is overly  enchanted by what happens at centers of mathematical research...of which  Princeton is one.<br />To his enormous credit, Singh does show that the very  structure of mathematics means that contributions from the margins, from  the Japanese work on which Wiles based his proof to Indian mathematician  Ramanujan's work, are essential to progress.<br />However, the narration is of  a one-way flow.  Babylonian and Sumerian bookkeepers and farmers evolved  concepts of number and measure in what nowadays would be called &quot;just  in time&quot; fashion.  They did not evolve zero or negative numbers  probably because their social organization was static enough to avoid the  need for credit (this is speculation.)  Zero and negative entered European  mathematics, it appears from most narratives, at the moment when the  increasing economic impact of voyages of discovery (such as that of  Columbus) required more sophisticated mechanisms of credit...including  bankruptcy and carrying negative balances.<br />This work is taken by  mathematicians at the summit.  Descartes did not invent negative numbers:  he showed instead where they could be modeled.<br />What is missing is a  reverse flow.  Singh ends with Wiles' real accomplishment.  What troubles  me is that the accomplishment is really the end of a story.  Not only of  amateur mathematicians laboring to solve the problem in isolation but also  of people, such as the young Andrew Wiles himself, who are inspired to  enter mathematics by the very idea of an unsolved problem, which to the  young mathematical mind is similar to the unexplored areas of maps.<br />We  can only admire such passionate purity as Wiles'.  But we need also work in  applied mathematics and similar passion and imagination in the teaching of  mathematics.  <br />The very way in which Singh's proof was announced by the  media including the New York Times was infected with postmodern American  end-of-history triumphalism, a mood which simply ignores growing  mathematical illiteracy (along with poverty and disease) and which sharply  separates the teaching and the application of mathematics from pure  math.<br />For example, we have no socially accepted way of reviewing computer  programs used by government and by industry for transparency and for  correctness whereas pure mathematics has the review process for its papers.   This is a growing problem if we accept Harvard law professor Lawrence  Lessig's contention that &quot;the code is the law.&quot;  <br />The sharp  distinction between pure and applied mathematics, reinforced by the Dead  White Male narrative of the history of mathematics, creates, in my view,  math anxiety which is the reason for massive failure in math and for poor  implementation of software.<br />Without at all discounting Wiles' achievement  or Singh's clear exposition of a very advanced part of mathematics, we can  also point out a world view which creates both Fine Hall (Princeton's math  department) and math anxiety.  I teach math and programming, and what fires  the gifted student is not triumphalist news of solved problems: this  narrative is hegemonic.  What fires the gifted student are books (even if  out of date, and published by Dover) with uncharted waters.<br />So many  mathematical geniuses start their careers with fascination with huge  numbers or with Quixotic quests to square the circle that we need to  emphasize, in all the hoopla, that in mathematical terms, there probably is  a nondenumerable number of unsolved problems remaining.  But the  triumphalist narrative is more like Arthur C. Clarke's short story The Nine  Billion Names of God, and self-infects with a message to the tyro that he  or she was born too late, and should hie on down to the technical institute  to learn mere programming.<br />Ordinary people cannot do pure mathematics and  most contemporary mathematicians get their ideas endogenously...from other  people in the field.  We've evolved beyond Euclid getting inspiration and  ideas from a farmer plowing a field.  But I look in vain in Singh for any  mention of possible application to social problems (I don't look for  application to defense.)  This aporia in Singh is part of the overall  presentation of solved problems at the summit, which, for an unknown  reason, allow us to ignore the problems of everyday life.<br />The question,  of course, is whether my view, that the skills of the pure mathematician  have any application whatsoever to the problems of society, is correct.  In  the latter days of Bertrand Russell, the author of Principia Mathematica  (having essentially blown it if either David Hilbert's formalism or  intuitionism are correct) called on mathematicians to focus on the real  possibility of nuclear war, but today the fashion of laissez-faire excludes  anything resembling the procedures of mathematics, pure OR applied, from  the solution ofsocial problems.<br />The trouble with this fashionable view  is that even if we cannot solve the riddle of justice with an equation, the  fashionable view throws the baby out with the bathwater, for missing in  discussion of social problems are not only mathematical methods other than  simple, and usually wrong, addition and subtraction of large sums for  defense and laughably small sums for human needs: also missing is the very  idea of a committment to truth.  There is in other words a high wall  between Wiles' absolute committment not only to truth but to line by line  verification, and the words and behavior of people educated in  non-mathematical subjects at Yale and at Princeton.  The  self-deconstructing words of Yalie George Dubya Bush come to mind.<br />We're  teaching only the maths guys the idea of a committment to truth (the  committment which caused Gottlob Frege to so movingly recant his life's  work in the logical foundations of arithmetic.)  Despite the real worth of  postmodern theory, properly understood, we're teaching the non-maths guys  and gals deconstructive nonsense which exhibits an ideological lack of any  committment to truth, such as a Politically Correct article I saw recently  which called the GI Bill &quot;racist.&quot;  Fortunately, men like George  Dubya tend nowadays to blow off this nonsense with intense partying but its  very existence replicates in them an opposing lack of a committment to  truth, the example having been set. <br />We live in a society in which  despite the real parallels between computer programming and mathematical  proof, American computer programmers are (according to a 1994 essay by  computer scientist PJ Plauger) almost childishly sullen when their work  (which has far more impact on everyday life than Fermat) is subject to peer  review.  American programmers behave like the way Pierre de Fermat behaved,  treating knowledge as a trade secret and taking a regressive pleasure in  creating confusion.  The result is a massive shift towards importing  programmers from India, modern-day Ramanujans who in my experience are real  gentlemen and who have the humility exhibited also by Andrew  Wiles.<br />There's a plaint in GH Hardy's A MATHEMATICIAN'S APOLOGY that (at  his 1930s Cambridge) the best and the brightest (&quot;Cambridge  Apostles&quot; like John Maynard Keyes and Anthony Blunt) did not regard  mathematicians as public intellectuals, like them.  Modern mathematicians  still feel this resentment at times.  They would do well to ponder that one  mark of the public intellectual is concern for the public good and the ways  in which one's work might enhance that good.  Pure mathematicians do, in my  view, ask to be ghettoized precisely by their desire to work in such thin,  clear air.  <br />But owing to triumphalist discourse which (in the darkest  possible view) presents the solution of Fermat as subconcious *ersatz* for  the solution of social problems, real mathematicians who enter applied  mathematics seem to be the inferior term in a binary opposition.	2000-07-28
US	50358924	RSSFDL4BU3FPO	1891620916	299684156	President Reagan: The Role Of A Lifetime	Books	3	7	62	N	N	And such things happened in America's land	By the dismal end of the Carter presidency in January of 1981, a sort of feedback loop (which certain French philosophers would dress in rich and strange clothes) had entered American political and economic discourse.  What the French called \\"semiotics\\", the names of expectations and fears played as large a role in politics as did real needs.  The gasoline crisis was not only a physical shortage but also the fear of not enough.  <br />These symbolic needs entered political calculation, and the presidency of Reagan was the first to meet them head on.  Of course, in 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (who Lou Cannon compares to Reagan, favorably) had anticipated this in \\"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\\"<br />However, FDR, after this comforting reassurance which foreshadowed Reagan, then set himself to real tasks.  FDR's activism, which so disturbed Hoover and the Republicans, went beyond comforting reassurances as to the fundamental stability of the system which was and is a Republican specialty.  On FDR's watch, something was done.<br />Reagan's Republican presidency deliberately manipulated the symbolic night-terrors of Americans while neglecting real tasks, and this was put simply by a student of mine.  A middle-aged gentleman, he said simply that you never saw homeless children in America before the 1980s and as another middle-aged gentleman I can concur.<br />Throughout Reagan's presidency, there was a curious illusion.  The Chief Executive actually believed that under the real safety net that he and his advisers were deconstructing (not by cutting programs, but instead by sending budgets to Congress with insufficient funds, a form of check kiting) there was another, fantasy net constructed by FDR for their parent's generation and, in a sort of dream-like logic, untouched by their shenanigans.<br />This dreamlike denial persists.  Authorities on health insurance proclaim that somehow, people in need of medical care can find it, somewhere.  While thisis true in major cities like Chicago, in rural places many patients have simply nothing to do but sicken and die.  <br />Lou Cannon does not mention Governor Mario Cuomo's speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention which in an almost Jesuitical fashion carefully identified how the first half of the Reagan presidency was destroying individual people's lives.  Cuomo, like Marianne Moore, spoke scholastically of imaginary gardens with real toads in them: his speech was unreported, perhaps not even comprehended.<br />Lou Cannon wants, like many Beltway liberals over the last twenty years, to have his cake and eat it too.  Access to power, which Mr Cannon needs to pursue his career as author and journalist, demands ideological consent and therefore Cannon's overall thesis is incoherent.<br />It is that Reagan gave us back our American soul while his Presidency was riven by corrruption (not Reagan's, but other's), while his advisers violated longstanding law and policy and in some cases conducted themselves like buffoons. How is it possible that Reagan \\"gave us back our American soul\\" when as Cannon admits his administration combined some violations of the law with bumbling incompetence?<br />To Cannon's credit, his account of the Iran Contra mess makes clear a central fact that has been confused.  It is that while Reagan was not aware of the diversion of funds to the contras, a violation of the intent of Congress, he was aware of the general idea...which went against a policy supported by conservatives.<br />This policy was to not negotiate with \\"terrorists.\\" The supreme achievement of the Teflon presidency was to obscure this important point.  While on the semiotic plane America was hanging tough and crowds at the 1984 Olympics were chanting USA, their ideological brethern were not only negotiating with direct sponsors of Islamic terrorist groups, they were being taken, as Lou Cannon shows, for a ride.  <br />Psycho-history might help us to understand how men could behave in this conflicted fashion, but Cannon does fail to explore a psycho-historical pathway evident in the character of Don Regan, Reagan's homonymic Treasury chief and later Chief of Staff.<br />Regan's father had participated in a policeman's strike and had been fired by Calvin Coolidge in a way that directly foreshadowed Ronald Reagan's firing of the PATCO strikers in 1981.  Cannon describes Regan's luck in the immediate post-war era, where 15 years of FDR had opened up opportunities to our parent's generation: Regan became a millionaire Wall Streeter before entering government service.<br />But Cannon does not explore Regan's \\"anger issues\\" over the sort of men who'd surrounded Cal Coolidge and ensured in his father's day that Irishmen did not get a square deal, especially if they stepped out of line. Regan's rather destructive tenure as Chief of Staff, which coincided with Iran/Contra, as well as Oliver North's antics, make it clear that the chemistry of the Reagan presidency was one in which \\"Reagan democrats\\" like Regan took unconscious revenge for their father's destruction.<br />Reagan speechwriter Peggy Noonan liked Regan, comparing him to a sort of tough guy out of a 1930s gangster film.  But Cannon's mere narrative makes it clear that men like Regan and North nearly brought down the president and the new, Republican era, by cynically authorising policies (notably Iran-Contra) which not only contradicted the will of the (then Democratic) Congress but even the principles (such as not negotiating with terrorists) on which the new era was built.<br />Here there was a sort of belief that things like general principles are \\"just words\\", a popular belief in much of American life.  Reagan used this belief successfully in negotiating the end of the Cold War, for as Lou Cannon shows Reagan distrusted treaties of all sorts including the elaborate structure started under Carter.  This is psycho-historical, in that it is the reaction of the wounded tough guy whose betrayals started with his father's failure in the Depression to provide for his family.  FDR, from a gentlemanly world of promises easy to keep, sailed off to Yalta with a sublime self-assurance: whereas Lou Cannon's Reagan had a certain naivety as well (resulting from his California good fortune) Reagan was surrounded by wounded men who thought themselves immune to \\"gentlemen's agreements\\"...but who were snookered by Hezbollah all the same.  International treaties do indeed play a role in keeping the peace, and ultimately cynicism itself is a form of naivety. <br />Ollie North thought that his backroom deals were far better, say, than a Mideast conference at which all players might deal, only to find that the hostage-takers met their word as gentlemen (for they released some hostages) but cleverly enough, realized that Ollie had forgot to ask them from taking other hostages.  At the end of the day, this is the sort of deep thinking on tap at Foggy Bottom that Reagan's advisers treated with such contempt, and it probably would have saved some lives.<br />Cannon's narrative also makes it clear that two members of the older gentlemanly set (who personified the sort of man who oversaw, and betrayed, men like Regan and North in the Depression, the war, and in Vietnam) saved the country and its presidency.  These were two Princetonians, and former members of the United States Marine Corps, George Schultz and James Baker.  Their performance put at end to a sort of spell first cast by Henry Kissinger on our dealings: the illusion that one can even attain nefarious ends by being dishonest. <br />Schultz and Baker saved Reagan because they simply did not have the problems with anger that caused Regan to alienate Nancy Reagan and fail to oversee Iran-Contra.  They had instead a sort of old-fashioned self-assurance that is, or used to be, on tap at Princeton and Harvard and which when coupled with warrior virtue can't be beat for attaining the country's sometimes nefarious ends.  <br />But the good lacked all conviction, while the worst were full of a passionate intensity.  From North to Baker there was no sense of bushido.  Even Baker and Schultz were primarily concerned with removing themselves from messy involvement with the seamier side of the presidency.  There were, as Cannon notes, no resignations on principle.<br />Which raises a moral puzzle addressed in a recent novel, Mr White's Confession.  What is the responsibility of the well-intentioned man?<br />Immanuel Kant states, at the very beginning of Groundwork for a Metaphysic of Morals, that the only thing we can know to be good is purity of the will.  It is clear from the facts, and Cannon's biography, that Ronald Reagan had good intentions which undercut right-wing commitments to vernacular Machiavellianism.  In a way, Reagan was a liberal of the FDR era who wanted to save FDR's reforms...notably Social Security. Reagan had grown up in relative poverty which he'd not forgotten.  And one interpretation of his Presidency is that he did his best to save rather than destroy the basics of the 1950 liberal consensus in which he'd spent his rather sunny midlife.<br />Bumper stickers in California, up to the late 1980s, still stated with a Reagan-like innocence, \\"Don't	2000-07-12

For example, Ron Grossman in the Chicago Tribune pointed out last Sunday that the United States Postal Service has a stamp for Bugs  Bunny but none for John Brown, the rebel of Harper's Ferry.<br />The  Smithsonian Institution recently thought fit to exhibit Daisy's shortened  Levi's from the 1970s television series The Dukes of Hazzard.<br />The  infantilism is that the author of Forces of Production, David Noble, was a  serious and pro-labor voice who worked at the Smithsonian in the 1970s and  was forced out under Reagan...in favor of Daisy's shorts, it appears.<br />The  subject of Forces of Production may seem to be specialized for overtly it  is on numerically-controlled machine tools, nowadays a very small  application of computers.  Nonetheless this book can be read in the  context, not only of machine tools but also of computerization in  general.<br />Noble's book is an account of management folly.  Machine tool  automation was implemented to eliminate not the unskilled but men like my  great-grandfather: machinists who had the nerve to set their own pace, and  to design as they saw fit tools to accomplish their job.<br />The machinist  occupies in the world of physical tools somewhat the same space as is  occupied by the advanced programmer since the machinist has the choice, in  a well-run shop, of deciding not to fashion the part that management wants,  but instead to fashion a tool that will in turn make the part that  management wants...faster, more accurately and in the long and short run  cheaper.<br />Like Harry Braverman's Labor and Monopoly Capital, Noble shows  how this economic rationality was subverted by the high priests of economic  rationality: the CEOs.  <br />Ultimately preferring control over profits, the  managers of machine shops imported programmatic numerical control NOT to  make the skilled machinist's life easier but instead to eliminate the  skilled union men.<br />Noble shows how a rough compromise was hammered out  because the unskilled machinists, and the alienated skilled machinists,  stood by (under management's direction) as the improperly programmed  machine tools produced &quot;scrap at high speeds.&quot;<br />Union  negotiation then restored the skilled men to their positions to get the  technology under control.<br />There is a striking parallel here with the  situation in white-collar computer programming, for it has been the  consistent discovery of skilled programmers that the computer itself can be  used, NOT to &quot;focus on the bottom line goals of management&quot; (as  goes the management songbook) but instead to fashion tools...that  accomplish, in a laughing and almost scornful way, the goals of the  management.<br />For example, in 1974 I was confronted in a computer center  with 50 different programs to scan and to print mailing lists.  Being a  lazy hippie I suggested to my boss that I write ONE program that would read  and parse the format and the logic rules.  My manager approved and as a  result I implemented a form of &quot;data base.&quot;<br />Of course,  management does see the wisdom of this move, but typically (as related in  the case of machine tools by David Noble) management prefers to alienate  the programmers from the tools, which are bought from third parties.  While  this makes sense in many environments it has also produced unrecognized  disasters...especially where the programmers know or believe they could do  a better job.<br />For example, the state of Virginia recently wasted five  years and millions of dollars in trying to use a generalized solution from  Peoplesoft to automate human resources.  A new manager walked in and had  one or two good programmers code, in-house, the most needed routines on the  Web.<br />Reading Noble's important work teaches us how to avoid Luddism (and  Luddism itself may have a bad name for certain historians have shown that  the Luddite textile weavers of the early 19th century were critics, not of  technology itself, but of its use to downsize and to degrade.)  It gives  the ordinary person who wants at one and the same time to be successful at  his profession and to have time for his family an informed way of  criticising &quot;scrap at high speeds.&quot;	2000-06-02
US	50358924	R10FA34PE0YOBO	0140430377	493098356	The Complete Plays (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	19	32	N	N	Why you should read Chris Marlowe	Shakespeare is thought to be for the general reader and is undergoing a strong cinematic revival these days...perhaps because as a screenwriter in the public domain, Will doesn't talk back and works for free.<br />Marlowe,  apart from interest in the homoeroticism of his works, is still in the  specialist's domain.  But Marlowe in many ways is loads more fun than  Shakespeare, although the darkness of his vision is ultimately  tiresome.<br />If you like fustian, if you like the sound of the rant, Marlowe  is your boy:<br />&quot;Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships /And  burnt the topless towers of Ilium?&quot;<br />&quot;We'll lead you to the  stately tent of war/To hear the Scythian Tamburlaine/Threatening the world  with high astounding terms&quot;<br />Marlowe is probably deliberately  caricatured in Shakespeare's Henry V as Ancient Pistol, the &quot;braggart  soldier&quot;:<br />&quot;A foutra for the world, and worldlings base/I speak  of Africa and golden joys.&quot;<br />Marlowe's development was tragically cut  short, possibly by political scheming, or possibly by what we'd now call  alcoholism.  Even less than Wolfang Aamadeus Mozart (who popped off the  astonishing Magic Flute opera after a series of works of a genius that did  not break outside the frame of the *galante* musical style) had the chance  to be Beethoven, Marlowe never had a real chance to grow into the artist  that Shakespeare became.  We just don't know, after hundreds of years,  whether this was the Earl of Essex's fault or that of the good old  booze.<br />To see the opposing forces between the spirit of Shakespeare and  that of Marlowe, it is necessary to read the long series of three early  plays of Shakespeare, Henry VI, parts 1 to 3 (these have new titles in the  new Oxford Shakespeare.)  <br />Shakespeare and Marlowe collaborated in these  plays and it seems to me (as a nonspecialist) that Shakespeare's influenced  waxes in the higher numbered plays of the Henry VI series...despite the  fact that Wells and Taylor, the editors of the New Oxford Shakespeare, cast  doubts on a simple-minded chronological sequence of authorship.<br />As a  general reader I can well imagine Marlowe and Shakespeare BOTH coming up  with &quot;hung be the heavens with black&quot;, the first speech in Henry  VI part one, working in a tavern.  And my theory is that the profound  ambiguity of the character of King Henry VI, who in a superficial reading  is a mad weakling but on a deeper reading (in particular, that of Harold  Goddard in 1954) is an almost Taoist king who sees the folly of the Wars of  the Roses, can be traced to a collision between Marlowe's pessimistic  proto-Nietzchean view of the world, and Shakespeare's kinder and gentler  humanism.<br />I prefer Shakespeare's kinder and gentler humanism because it  is ultimately, like the Tao, stronger than pessimism.  And a reading of  Marlowe is relevant to today's issue of gay rights, for it shows that  homoeroticism is not a matter of fauns prancing about in Arcady, innocent  of the wickedness of the world of the breeders.  It shows that  homoeroticism has a deeply violent strain.<br />For example, Marlowe's play  Edward II (about a mediaeval English king who was deposed because of his  &quot;favorites&quot;, possibly mediaeval code for &quot;it won't do to  have a homosexual king&quot;) makes no hero of Edward II.  Edward II is  just as much a tyrant as his father was and his son Edward III  &quot;Longshanks&quot; became, and this is made plain in the play's  treatment of his relationship with Isabella.  The entire play, one of the  worst in Marlowe's short corpus, is one in which a bunch of nasty people  hasten to their doom without benefit of character development.<br />Read  Marlowe, therefore, as a more modern man than Shakespeare.  There are few  enough Will Shakespeares on the streets of modern cities: those that are,  are snapped up quickly by the more discriminating sorts of ladies.  But thestreets and taverns are crowded, today, with the spiritual descendents of  Kit Marlowe, Edward II and Faust: young men in despair as a consequence of  living in a closed world rather than the green and open world of  Shakespeare (a world where forgiveness is possible.)  <br />One spirit of the  Renaissance was power over nature, but a darker spirit was power over men  by men (this was identified by C. S. Lewis.)  As a direct consequence, many  educated and sophisticated young fellows today live in a world foreclosed  of laughter and surprise...a world that their sisters can access, with the  result that over the past 20 years, men's overall situation has been in  decline.<br />By not being able to grow past a certain point as does Lear and  the always astonishing Hamlet, in Marlowe's own words, &quot;cut is the  branch that might have grown full straight.&quot;  Read superficially, Dr  Faustus is a simple morality tale: don't sell yer silly soul to the devil.   This misses the self-reflexive character of the end in which the character  realizes his own inability to grow beyond a certain point.  Self-knowledge  is not enough.<br />And note, that contrary to today's excitements about  &quot;identity politics&quot;, the same sort of personality can be found in  gay bars and breeder bars.  &quot;Identity politics&quot; has managed to  obscure in the public mind the fact that quite apart from whether one is  gay or straight, the old questions remain.  It is of course evil to judge  gay people like Dr Laura, and the most pernicious aspect of Dr Laura is the  fact that if you're fool enough to believe her, being gay means you're  damned, and you might as well party on.  Marlowe does reveal the  inescapability of the question and implies the existence of the green world  simply by painting himself into a corner.	2000-05-25

The Columbia History of Western Philosophy narrates western philosophy in a more collective way than traditional histories of philosophy, and, for related reasons, its editor, Richard H Popkin, has called upon a diverse group of specialists to edit the chapters.  <br />This is both Politically  Correct and academically conventional, but it means that the Columbia  history is not a good introduction to philosophy for the general reader:  instead it is an excellent reference book for someone already versed in  philosophy.<br />In former days, the history of philosophy was biographical,  and focused on the thought of the major dead white males.   .... Throughout his book, Popkin's authors provide this Politically Correct equal time and the general reader already well-versed in philosophy can learn much.  But Popkin, in the selfsame interests of Political Correctness, fails to have his team judge, and for that matter, the judgements of a team are almost guaranteed to be a least common denominator.  The sophisticated and academic reader can be left with more questions than answers, but the general reader is, I think, ultimately confused: did Plato mean what Plato said or was Plato messing with our minds?  Should Spinoza have gotten married and settled down?  Was Theodore Adorno a schnook or a good guy? ....	2000-05-20
US	50358924	R1TQY1GJF61E7S	046503912X	952723106	Code: And Other Laws Of Cyberspace	Books	5	6	18	N	N	Theorizing the Internet	In CODE and Other Laws of Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig presents some alternatives to the libertarianism of the \\"digerati.\\"  At the same time, I looked in this book in vain for discussion of how deeply the Internet  changes the rules. <br />Lessig does not speak at all to two legal \\"code\\"  issues.  They are the problems of \\"meta-regulation\\" and the way in which  cyberspace cannot map, fully, \\"conceptual\\" space. Lessig takes it for  granted, as against a sort of pessimistic libertarianism, that we can  regulate cyberspace.  The pessimistic libertarian despairs of being able to  do this.<br />The real reason for regulatory pessimism may be the Turing  halting problem, the result in abstract computer science that in general no  Turing machine (a mathematical model of the essential characteristics of  all possible digital computers) can tell whether another halts.  This  result means that it is not always possible to use a Turing machine to  predict the behavior of another Turing machine.<br />A static \\"dumb\\" text can  be investigated for keywords indicating pornography.  Common solutions  don't address the quoting problem and for this reason speech that  \\"mentions\\" but does not \\"use\\" the keywords will be treated identically as  speech that uses the key words.  This exerts a \\"chilling effect\\" on  critical discussion that describes pornography or other illegal conduct by  quoting the \\"bad\\" texts.<br />Most perniciously, and most reminiscent of the  way in which Alan Turing proved the unsolvability of the halting problem,  this text monitor will very possibly highlight its very own text and  similar texts.<br />When I was working as a programmer at Princeton university  I suggested a program that would examine our network for \\"politically  incorrect\\" words including the classic cuss words.  One of my coworkers was  shocked to learn that my program's source would have to include the  offending words and if I were to transfer this code across the network, it  would flag its own text.<br />If the code is the law, thouight and care has to  be given to the writing of even trivial code: this does not happen now.   Lessig favors open code which overcomes the pragmatic fact that it is  impossible to write a provably correct large program, by forcing a social  review of the source code.  <br />Neither writers of closed nor of open source  code, today, resemble attorneys or even legislators.  Furthermore, writers  of the closed source live under an ideological regime, first named by the  sociologist Phillip Kraft in 1978, in Kraft's landmark book, Programmers  and Their Managers.<br />Kraft notes that  the ongoing training of computer  programmers is not only technical it is also ideological, and slanted  heavily towards private, business needs.  In modern day technical and  training documentation, a sort of \\"binary opposition\\" is made between the  business architecture of a data system and its more technical  implementation.<br />This binary opposition has two effects.  One is to  privilege the business side.  Derrida was perhaps the first philosopher to  note that the creation, in our thought, of binary oppositions such as  male/female tends not to equal and fair treatment, cognitively or  ethically, of the two terms.  Instead it tends to favor one of the  terms.<br />This binary opposition sharply favors the business side.  Documentation of systems describes elements as \\"business objects\\" even when  these \\"objects\\" are used for not-for-profit ends.<br />This infects the  ideology of working computer professionals with something like Charles  Wilson of General Motors' hegemonic philosophy: \\"what's good for General  Motors is good for the country.\\"<br />Part of the problem is the United States  legal system and the way it withholds, from working writers of the code,  the ability to make management decisions while at the same time forcing  those code writers to make the decisions (typically in the server room at  3:00 AM.)  This regime (which is a result of the 1948 Taft-Hartley act)  means that code writers who wish to be compensated fairly must assert  ownership in code, and it means that Open Source may be a detour and  frolic.<br />Lessig does not think in the terms of legal criticism: he uses  instead our Constitution as a final authority.  This means that he has to  accept the current industrial system of producing code as the best of all  possible words.  But in this actual process there is a considerable amount  of sheer waste, a considerable amount of politics and a considerable amount  of abuse.<br />This situation is gradually destroying another sort of \\"space\\"  which is not mentioned in the book at all, and this is the space of theory  itself.<br />A German philosopher, Edmund Husserl, identified this space which  I can only describe as a shared conceptual, ethical and even aesthetic  space.  He called the contents of this space \\"ideas\\" but stressed  throughout his career that he was not a psychologist and these ideas were  not in our minds.  <br />The problem with code may be that it reifies and even  deadens the contents of conceptual space and transfers it into cyberspace.   A very interesting example is in a surprising location, for Rutgers  computer scientist Steven Skiena's book The Algorithm Design Manual  (Springer 1998) reproduces a modern sentencing guideline, such as may be  found in a judge's spreadsheet, for various levels of theft and  robbery.<br />Skiena shows how the very reification of the sentencing  guidelines, which were supposed to redress the presumably bad consequences  of judicial discretion, results in a significant bias: for the sentencing  guidelines  make the penalties high for small robberies and low for large  thefts.  This places a class bias against the poor (likely to commit the  small crimes) and in favor of white-collar criminals.<br />It's an example of  code acting silently as law.<br />The answer lies in creating a programming  profession not as tied to industrial needs.	2000-05-13

The Return of Little Big Man, as entertainment, is as entertaining as the  original: what I am concerned about here is situating the two books in  MODERN American history, and a flaw in character development.<br />Although  historical romance can be a good guide to real history (and George  MacDonald Fraser, whose Flashman series bears more than a passing  resemblance to Lttle Big Man, has pointed this out in Fraser's Hollywood  History of the World), it is in a sense impossible to extricate the  historical romance from its own time.<br />The original book and the movie  appeared at a time, the 1960s, in which the American story of the frontier  was undergoing a rapid change as a consequence of the Vietnam war.  In a  sense, our adventure in Vietnam was a continuation of our Western  adventures which attempted to transfer Manifest Destiny across a rather  large ocean...and which failed.<br />There are echoes of these concerns in the  book and the movie Little Big Man (which came out about 1969) made a  conscious comparision of our Western policies with our Vietnam policies.   <br />Thirty years on and partly as a consequence of the many social changes  that occured in the 1960s, a sort of Victorianism has returned to the USA:  for one thing, sheer hypocrisy is no longer laughed out of court...as  evidenced by the Starr investigation of Clinton.<br />As a result, Berger's  latter-day Jack Crabbe, the &quot;sole white survivor of the Battle of  Little Bighorn&quot;, is a different persona than the picaresque individual  of the first book [parenthetically, and judging from Berger's first novel,  George MacDonald Fraser's &quot;Flashman and the Redskins&quot; and many  other works, Greasy Grass was quite crowded with white survivors.   Apparently there were dozens of unaccounted scouts, 'breeds, British  officers, mad bishops and perhaps a German band present at the battle  :-).]<br />A &quot;picaresque&quot; novel, which the original novel was and  the sequel isn't, is at least supposed to be the comic adventures of a  character of lower morals than ours.  Fraser carries this off quite nicely  in Flashman, and has an attractive breeziness with regards to his character  (the bully of the 19th century book by Thomas Arnold who in Fraser goes on  to be present at most military disasters of the 19th century British  empire.)<br />Fraser does not judge Flash Harry and Flash Harry, speaking  through Fraser, does not try to be better than he is.  Flashy honestly  loves, lusts, and sees the dawn &quot;come up like thunder outer China  'crost the Bay.&quot;<br />But the latter-day Jack Crabbe seems to strain away  from the Wild West towards something finer and to at one and the same time  want a more gilded and virtuous existence...yet betray himself at the  critical point.  <br />The original Jack Crabbe &quot;knowed Custer for what  he wuz&quot; and knew hisself for what he wuz.  The latter day Jack Crabbe  is much more ambivalent about his existence on the frontier and somewhat  contemptuous of men like Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday.  He judges them  harshly, when he himself gets drunk in New York when he thinks his  inamarota (Amanda Teasdale, a defender of the Indians and a precursor of  the Politically Correct) has gotten married.<br />I cannot tell Mr Berger, who  has written an excellent and entertaining book, how to build a character.   But I do notice that whereas the first Jack Crabbe reserved his judgement  for societies that exterminated the native peoples of this continent, the  latter day Crabbe tends more to judge people.  This is less an artistic  flaw than an indication of how America has changed from 1964 to 1999.  It  does deprive us of the pleasure and scandal of the picaresque, and, in  Victorian terms, TheReturn of Little Big Man is less titillating and more  of an Improving Moral Tale.<br />I am old enough to have lived in certain  dying embers of the Victorian age: my grandparent's parlor was in that  style.  This is probably why I am titillated by the picaresque in the first  place.  To relate to Flash Harry, one has to have, like Clinton and I,  scuttled for cover during the Vietnam war.  Berger's first novel  constructed, in the figure of the Hehmaneh, an alternative to the modal  midcentury American male.  Nowadays, absent the military draft, this is  probably not as attractive to younger readers...and it seems that Berger is  at pains to tell us in this book that the Hehmaneh were uncommon, and to  have Jack Crabbe be positively contemptuous of &quot;queeries&quot;  (Crabbe's hilarious mispronunciation of the Prince of Wales'  &quot;equerries&quot;) who Jack thinks are tutti-fruity.  Here there is a  shift back to intolerance.<br />It is my view that a novelist, if the novelist  is constructing a non-picaresque role model character, should not in any  way have that character, at the end of the day, have unattractive personal  traits...but Crabbe's limitations are just these.  Shakespeare's Hamlet  says, use every man according to his deserts, and none of us should 'scape  whipping...not Flash Harry, nor Wyatt Earp.  In the great desert of  American fiction, in which unattractive-but-cool characters are more or  less force fed to the reader (as in the unspeakable Tom Wolfe) one does  look in vain for Flashman, or Hamlet, or even Captain Ahab.	2000-05-03

He is both a public intellectual and a judge, as well as one of the leading philosophers of the movement in legal theory called &quot;Law and Economics.&quot;<br />This is an admirable record, and  one way the judge has built his reputation is by being a prolific and  readable writer on law.  Overcoming Law is one of the best summaries of his  work because as a series of essays, the reader is at liberty to dip into  the most interesting topics.<br />Understanding law and economics is a  prerequisite.  This is Posner's (and Ronald Coase's) idea that  descriptively, judges try to maximize social wealth by allocating to  claimants the results that those claimants are most willing to pay for.   Prescriptively, to Posner, this is a Good Thing.<br />Solomon in the Bible  acted in a Posnerian fashion because the &quot;good&quot; mother valued her  child's life over her possession of the child whereas the bad mother valued  her possession over the kid's life.  Posner would not say that Solomon saw  the abstract good and made a decision according to his conception of the  abstract good (which Posner feels can be flawed.)  Instead Posner would say  that Solomon found a decision procedure which revealed the true values of  the claimants.<br />This makes sense.  What makes less sense is that Posner  turns Marx's theories on their head, and this is rather dizzying, since  Marx turned Hegel on his head.  In Posner's ideal world, any atomic  business transaction reveals that actor A values product or service P more  than B does if B transfers that product or service at price R.<br />Better  critics than I have pointed out that economic actors who are acting close  to the bone, such that they must work or trade, or die, may not value their  mininum wage more than the service they render.  They may value the time  highly but sacrifice it anyway as a precondition for their existence.As  Kant would say, existence is not a predicate, but a precondition to having  predicates.  Translated to the economic sphere, existence is not a Yuppie  luxury, like an SUV, nor is it a necessity like bread.  It is a  precondition for having either.<br />Posner writes, I believe, from the  standpoint of the lucky American who has never had to face extinction as a  consequence of the economy and this gives his thought a certain lack of  heart which is also a failure to think things through.<br />This is most on  display in Posner's essay &quot;Hegel and Employment at Will.&quot;  Here,  Posner speaks directly to legal philosophers including Drucilla Cornell who  have made a case, based on the thought of Hegel, for property rights to  jobs.  Posner's defense of employment at will (which was thought, as  recently as 1980, to be an out of date theory) is based on nothing more  than an empirical, and questionable, economic claim: that we enjoy higher  economic growth in America as a consequence of employment at will.<br />This  is to be misled by the numbers, for many observers of European societies  (with their social welfare programs and longer vacations) have pointed out  that qualitatively, the consequent higher unemployment in Europe does NOT  seem to lead to a high level of misery.  In Japan, during the last ten  years, that country has been in deep recession, with high unemployment, but  qualitative commentators have noticed that the Japanese react differently  than Americans have done.<br />Posner tends to accept high levels of  employment which result from churning in the employment market as a good  thing.  As a sitting judge with probable lifetime tenure, Posner does not  see the disruption that results from employment at will...even to  businesses themselves.  <br />In general, Posner is a clever and readable  ideologue and apologist for Reagan-era ideology.  No matter what your views  on these changes it is a very good idea to read Judge Posner...if only to  be able to spot arguments which use his thought, and to show (as does  philosopher Martha Nussbaum) that by their lack of qualitative, and even  ethical, reflection, they lack the rationality they claim.	2000-04-27

It is important to point out that Teddie Adorno is spinning in his grave, for the very venue on which I am reviewing Critical Models is itself an example of the fetishized, reified and administered world that Adorno named, and critiqued. However, Adorno's philosophical tradition also  includes the catchphrase what is, is right, and would probably view the  Internet as more or less a necessary consequence of vast economic forces  which it would be simple minded to simply ignore, or negate. And, his  &quot;dialectical&quot; logic not only permits us to log on and praise him  where praise is due: it requires us to do so. <br />This collection is of  essays written after Adorno returned to the Federal Republic of Germany in  the early 1950s. Because culturally Adorno was &quot;very German&quot; and  indeed he resented the *Volkische* definition of Germanness imposed by  Hitler, Adorno delayed his escape, as the son of a Jewish father and  Catholic mother, from Hitlerdom to a dangerous point. He resided briefly in  England and somewhat longer in America. Strangely, he did not like England  and (given the choice) preferred America, and specifically California, the  latter because of its climate. <br />This collection makes it clear that  although Adorno was critical of many tendencies in America he was by no  means knee-jerk in his criticism. Adorno enjoyed the very real democracy of  American life and the very real empiricism of science as practised  here...insofar as democracy and empiricism did not become, as a very  different sort of emigre might call it, a shtick, or a number: or, as  Adorno would call it, fetishized or reified. <br />But it is clear from these  essays that Adorno would be very critical of changes in America that have  occured since my generation, that of the immediate post-war Baby Boom, has  taken over the shop. Adorno's work on Fascist tendencies in California, for  example, located Fascism in our hearts and at our dinner tables. These  tendenciesare denied in ceremonies (such as the commemoration, last week,  of the bombing in Oklahoma City) which are structured by press and lawyers  in a way that fully denies anything like a spontaneous response. <br />One  naturally wonders why it is that people at these commemorations, which  memorialize real pain that should never be repeated, have to act in such  structured fashions, and it was the structuring of Timothy McVeigh's life  by similar tendencies that caused him, in all probability, to bomb the  Murragh building. <br />It was irresponsible to decry social research that  located Fascist and authoritarian tendencies so close to home and to expect  no incidents such as the bombing of the Oklahoma City building. Adorno's  work is a reminder to examine our own environment for barbarism, and  Americans who have worked on issues of domestic abuse are in his tradition,  even if they would actually find the guy irritating, arrogant and  conceited...all of which he was. <br />Some of the book does require, because  of Adorno's arrogance, a knowledge of German philosophy, which is not a  laugh a minute by any means. The essay &quot;On Subject and Object&quot;,  for example, may be completely opaque, even to, and especially to, the  &quot;educated&quot; reader if her education is in the typical American  university. That's because what we mean by the subject may be divergent  from what Ted meant, a difference expressed by our own  &quot;catchphrase&quot;, &quot;that's subjective.&quot; <br />&quot;That's  subjective&quot; means in ordinary usage that &quot;that&quot; can be  dismissed, and despite the (laudable) place that mere listening plays in  our life, &quot;that's subjective&quot; forecloses listening. Adorno writes  from a tradition in which subjectivity is not a sink and instead is a  source of value. <br />The surprising end of &quot;on subject and object&quot;  is one in which the mere subject acquires value precisely by being removed  from a place of origin: we realize, in the general murk of Adorno's style,  that the very reason why we exhibit a false humility about our own  subjectivity is that we are delivered a false story about our origins as  &quot;the first man&quot;, which exalts the subjectivity of a mythical  Adam, and makes our own second-hand.  Adorno makes the common sense point  that given our initial resources (which are inferior, because less  specialized, than those of other large mammals) &quot;the first man&quot;  was probably the group, in which the &quot;subjectivity&quot; of each  member had to be (paradoxically enough) treasured because it was a group  resource. <br />The experience of reading the more difficult essays is one of  struggle, and reward, in which one realizes that one's mere failure to  comprehend is only in part a product of ignorance: it is one of dawn. This  is in contrast to reading the typical American scholarly essay in which the  very lack of participation and struggle...and the airy dismissal of  important questions as marginalia, drives questions to the zone of the  subconscious. <br />That is, Adorno is outside of the tradition which recast  and rephrased problems into such a shape that they could be solved...that  their solution was implied by their clear phrasing. Mathematics is an  example of this. At its best (and Adorno conceded this in many ways) this  tradition is a source of both power and democracy. <br />At its worst,  however, and especially as applied to Adorno's own field of social  research, this tradition makes people into objects precisely because it has  to ignore the philosopher's tendency to delay, by questioning everything.  The most obscene consequence of this is the political poll and its unstated  influence on our elections. <br />Like Adorno's longer works but more  accessibly, Critical Models rewards reading, and rereading: the very  density of his style provides, in terms that would make the guy shudder,  good value for the dollar...precisely because, as	2000-04-22

Its orange cover, and alarming, intellectual, title, make Dialectic of Enlightenment somewhat of a chick magnet :-).<br />The unreadability of Frankfurt School texts is an artifact of the very phenomena they criticize. Educated people in America at the time Dialectic of Enlightenment was written were influenced, directly and indirectly, by the pragmatism of John Dewey and English Logical Positivism as mediated by Bertrand Russell and A. J. Ayer. A bit later, the Continental school of Logical Positivism came to America fleeing Fascism.<br />Pragmatism is the homegrown American philosophy that the useful is the true and the true, useful. Logical Positivism in Britain and on the Continent is the view that the meaningful is only the verifiable statement of natural science. Both traditions are completely inimical to the older Continental views of Adorno and of Horkheimer, based as they are on those of Hegel, Freud and Marx.<br />Adorno would probably see straight through the question begging that goes on in both Pragmatism and Logical Positivism. Both these philosophies fail to self-apply, in a logical failure which is also a failure to exhibit the intellectual virtue of humility. If we ask the Pragmatist about the utility of his view that truth is utility he cannot answer. Similarly, Logical Positivism's own claim, that meaningful statements are either verifiably true or verifiably false using the procedures of science, fails, even less than Pragmatism, to self-apply, because we simply can't verify the nonexistence of a meaningful but unverifiable statement. This result, which conclusively has shown nearly all major-league philosophers that Logical Positivism is deep nonsense, has been generalized in recent years to show that there are even apparently scientific statements, such as statements as to what transpires inside black holes, which are not verifiable.<br />However, the nonsense of Pragmatism and of Logical Positivism had in the period 1930 to about 1980 much influence, again direct and indirect, on educated Americans. Directly, they were exposed to it in undergraduate survey courses and of course as philosophy specialists. Indirectly the ideas were in the air, and they have had strong influence on the management, and the mismanagement, of America's economy and its foreign policy. <br />For this reason, and because of the deconstruction of a decent educational system, contemporary post-moderns in America find actual post-modern classics including Dialectic of Enlightenment tough going. <br />But to be constructive. \\"Dialectic\\" in the title refers to a form of logic which commencing with the early 19th century German philosopher Hegel. It is presented, superficially, in survey classes as a weird kind of pseudo-logic in which things become their opposite, and then the thing and its opposite \\"synthesize\\" to form a higher, more involved thing.<br />But this superficial nonsense fails to account for the dialectic at all. The dialectic is a response, in the real material conditions that have obtained in developed societies since the end of the 18th century, to the fact that mere traditional logic is a closed system. Mere traditional logic seems to the ordinary person verbal games and, strikingly, it is the same to the evolved modern mathematician if he's of the \\"formalist\\" school. You merely have to change the axioms to get the results you want in mere traditional logic.<br />Tradtional (and modern) logic is like a machine for accomplishing our purposes that it becomes (in indeed a dialectic fashion) the opposite of what we need. The 17th century philosopher Leibniz was so impressed by the apparent power of primitive formsof modern logic that he thought that any dispute would be by now, at the close of the millenium, settled in gentlemanly fashion with \\"let us calculate, sir.\\" As what would now be termed a high-paid \\"consultant\\" to the CEOs of his time and place (petty, and small-minded, German princelings) Leibniz included political and social matters in this view.<br />Leibniz saw in logic a machine that would remove decisionmaking from passion and self-interest and indeed logic, and its technological, embodied form the modern digital computer, does so with such thoroughness that the \\"fair\\" decision machine becomes its opposite. We merely have to change the program to get the results we want, whether those results be true and fair and just, or deep nonsense.<br />Hegel, Marx and Freud were healthy and human reactions to this manipulative spirit, and dialectical logic, far from being anti-modern-logic (as its more hysterical opponents like Quine seem to feel), actually rescues traditional and modern logic from criminal manipulation. For example, in human and in social affairs, the very fact that each actor is not a thing and has capabilities to react to features of the system in totality, consistently makes social planning self-defeating. In the Five Year Plans of the Stalin era, the very fact that factory managers were more or less informed of the direction of the whole caused the numerical decision procedures used in determining whether those targets would be met to be distorted towards optimism that caused famine and war. In the Reagan White House, the commitment of an autistic Chief Executive to meeting impossible economic targets likewise caused his budget director, David Stockman, to fudge the numbers using a primitive spreadsheet and what Stockman called \\"the magic asterisk\\" to identify needed savings, not yet identified, that would balance the books.<br />Traditional and modern logic is a babe in the woods as regards such chicanery. But the dialectic, centering human over technical relationships, sees and can account for this behavior. Its overall procedure is to weigh irreconcilable interests against each other, to predict the synthesis that will result. In Horkheimer and Adorno, the dialectical claim is that the very science and technology produced by the 18th century enlightenment would over time produce its opposite. Kant's individual freedom to be a knower (a scientist or independent entrpreneur) would turn, amid the pressure of real human events, into a higher form of enslavement.	2000-01-01
