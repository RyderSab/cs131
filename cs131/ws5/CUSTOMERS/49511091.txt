Not only do I love this book compared to his others but it is on my favorite books of all time list.  I think it's fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed every page.  Like several others have said it's not really a mystery per se although a murder does take place.   I highly recommend anyone who hasn't gotten around to reading it do so asap.	2004-11-05

It just got more and more unbelievable and ridiculous and the ending was too abrupt.   <br />That being said I will still read anything written by John Case because even my least favorite book of his  (theirs? I think it's a husband and wife team writing together) is still good.	2004-11-05

I put it there only because this title kept coming up on book review sites, favorite lists, etc. everywhere I looked.  When a book comes up that often I usually give it a try and it usually turns out to have been everywhere I looked for a reason.  (This is why I finally read Val McDermid's A Place of Execution and it was fantastic also.)  Well my theory stands!  This was terrific little novel and I highly recommend it, I read it in one day because it was so good.	2004-11-05

I enjoyed this book as much if not more this reading and I am 33 now!  I highly recommend reading this book for a nice escape into the life of 13 year old in the 70's.  (The original printing is what I recommend, the description above sounds like they may have updated the book and that as far as I am concerned would ruin the whole point of it. Find an old copy!)	2004-07-19

The mystery was enjoyable enough but it was the music info that I really loved.  I will definitely read the next in the series.  I'm assuming that's where he's headed given the ending of the book.	2004-07-15

Because of them I went out and bought it in hardback and I am very sorry I did.  I recommend anyone tempted to do the same get it from the library instead. I didn't find it to be well written or original.  The funny parts woven in were good I will admit but the rest (of what I could bring myself to read, which was not the entire book) was rehashed standard mystery stuff ( and I LOVE a good mystery). This just wasn't worthy of finishing in my opinion.	2004-07-05

You really can't go wrong no matter which book you choose.  My all time favorites of his are The Stand, The Dead Zone, and all of his short story collections.   But I will eventually read everything he's ever written, still working on it!	2004-07-05
US	49511091	R1LCCEERTEQGHF	0312289723	1827617	Ten Big Ones (Stephanie Plum Novels)	Books	2	6	8	N	Y	Huge Evanovich fan- terrible book	I agree with an earlier reviewer in that I'm not even sure Janet Evanovich wrote all of this book.  The dialogue is not of the same quality and the plot is meandering and pointless. I am very disappointed especially because I thought the ninth in the series was the best one since the very first, One for the Money.  Don't get me wrong, I know these are light and funny mysteries and I don't expect Brian Haig or John Sanford-like writing.  However there is a reason Evanovich is as popular as she is and it's because she has written a high quality series of funny, quirky books.  This does not match the level of the others.  Wait for the paperback or get it from the library.	2004-07-01

All three of his books are good, Hostile Witness is probably the best of the three.  Several times throughout the book different characters have to tell their story, and each time it's even more incredible than the last.  This book is a thriller/mystery but it's also something more, I don't really know what it is, maybe it's just plain good writing.	2003-12-19

I really enjoy the atmosphere created in her writing.  I have not been able to get into her series books but these two are definitely worth picking up.	2003-12-19

I regularly lend this book to friends who aren't regular readers and tell them &quot;Just read the first chapter.&quot; They are of course then hooked and read the whole book in less than a week.  This book is the reason mystery/thriller readers read. It grabs you and doesn't let go. So, even if you aren't much of a reader but are going on vacation, on a long flight, etc. this is the book to bring with you.	2003-12-18
US	49511091	R37NNJU6D0KQ7A	0451169530	825352881	The Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	One of my all time favorites.	I read this book every couple years, it is just the best book ever written I think.  Note to others who love this book: did the mass exodus out of NYC on 9/11 walking across the bridges make you think of this novel? When a couple of the characters are trying to get out of NYC? I recommend first time readers try to find a copy of the originaly published edited version.  All they seem to have in stores these days is the later released unedited version and there's a lot of extra stuff you don't really need to read unless you're already a huge fan of the book, like myself. So I would hunt down an older copy in a used book store or from the library- I think you will enjoy it a lot more.  I hope before I die, and he does, that S. King will write a sequel to this novel.  Read it!	2003-12-18

This book is good and if it didn't have to be compared to Tell No One and Gone for Good I might even say it was very good.  However, Coben has raised his own bar and this just didn't make it in my book (no pun intended).  It's worth reading, just not what I expected after the last two.	2003-12-18

Demille really knows how to write.  This is a good book for a vacation, it's exciting yet has some depth to it, it's not just a pure thriller that moves along at the speed of light.	2003-12-18

The cases are extremely interesting, however the style of writing is annoying to the point of distraction.  There is a way of writing of one's accomplishments without sounding like a self-aggrandizing 16 year old.  McCrary, Ressler (and the writers helping them) apparently are not aware of this.  I think John Douglas's book, Mindhunter, got it right.	2003-12-18

It is the quintessential quirky mystery with lots of fun characters and an enjoyable mystery plot.  I read it about once a year.  Even if you don't normally pick up a novel this short, give it a try, you'll enjoy it! <br />My second favorite of D. Gilman's is the first Mrs. Pollifax novel, I think it's the Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax.	2003-12-18

I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did, in fact it's totally not something I would usually pick up at all. I'm not sure why I did except that I love the show, Raymond, and I love the cover of the book, oh and I love that she busted out Michelle Pfeiffer on her plastic surgery on Leno, well I guess I do know why I picked it up!

I can't understand why so many of my favorite authors wrote very positive blurbs for this formula mystery.  I fell for the hype and bought this book in hardback and I am sorry I did.  Heed this warning, if you're going to read it, buy it in paperback or get it from the library.	2003-09-26

The main character is your usual woman character written by a male author, she is a drop dead gorgeous, could be a model but somehow became a policeman,and of course has the usual \\"too full breasts and too slim hips\\".

I will always own a copy of it so I can read it every few years and share it with friends. It is an action-packed book that begins with the lead character as he leaves for Vietnam. Soon after he  arrives,he is set up for a crime and then becomes a P.O.W.  His escape, 20  or so years later, and his subsequent revenge against those who set him up  for the crime and imprisonment take place at an incredibly fast pace.   Reading this book is like watching an action movie - only better.  If you  loved Nelson Demille's Word of Honor you will love Crux.	2000-05-18
