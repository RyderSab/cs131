US	44429548	RN15QCO2M0EV	0385508042	106527389	The King of Torts	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Good but...	...while I really enjoy John Grisham's legal thrillers, they all have the same formula.  Good guy gets into a bad situation, learns his lesson in life, and some how gets himself out of it.  This story follows the formula - Clay is a lawyer with the OPD defending the criminals.  He likes his job, has a long-time girl friend who wants him to take on another job that pays more but he refuses and they break up.  After the break-up, Clay is contacted by a mysterious man who has an 'offer to good to be true' and Clay decides to take the offer (similar to the Firm and other Grisham books).  In the beginning Clay is overwhelmed by his good fortune - however begins to realize the greed and guilt associated with this new lifestyle is too much to handle.  <br />I am still compelled to read Grisham's books - and truly enjoy reading them, BUT they are getting almost too familar.  If this is your first Grisham book - you will really enjoy it.  Grisham is a great writer and story teller - he just needs a new story to tell.	2003-02-20
US	44429548	R1GRPJI0SL6C9W	0312305060	785940945	The Hours	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A must read...	I decided to read the book before seeing the movie...at first it was difficult to get into.  The long, descriptive sentence structure took some time to get used to - however within a few pages these sentences become poetic and melodic.  As I read the book, I pictured Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore as the main characters.  The story is wonderfully moving, thought provoking and so insightful.  I loved how one chapter is devoted to each of the main characters - shifting from Virgina Woolf, to Mrs Brown and then to Mrs. Dalloway.  Cunningham is able to write in such a way that the transition from one character and time period to the next is seamless.  The ending (and I won't give it away as others have) is such a shock and so moving.  I can't wait to see the movie - however I don't think the movie can begin to do justice to this masterpiece of literature.<BR>I highly recommend the book!	2003-02-19

I finished THE BIG SLEEP in a few days and was so impressed by the book, I immediately bought FAREWELL, MY LOVELY.  Another great novel by Chandler.<br />The book begins with Marlowe being pulled into a barroom mishap when an ex-con is looking for his girl.  Once Marlowe finishes with the police reports, he thinks his day is over.  At the office he receives a phone call from a man who needs his help.  The man asks Marlowe to accompany him to a 'business' meeting.  This is only the beginning of a twisted mystery which Marlowe is faced with solving.  <br />Once again Chandler does a great job of weaving various stories and characters in an effortless manner which takes the reader easily through the mystery.  I look forward to reading another Marlowe mystery...they are pure joy!	2002-08-06

I am a big fan of mystery books such as Sue Grafton's alphabet series...now I see how the genre began.  Raymond Chandler sets the bar for other PI novels to follow.<br />THE BIG SLEEP introduces us to Phillip Marlowe - a sarcastic PI with a unique perspective on things.  Marlowe is hired by an aging rich man to find out who is blackmailing one of his daughters.  Marlowe finds out the blackmailing is only the beginning of a tangled web of intrigue.  There are two murders that seem unrelated at first, however as the book progresses Chandler does a wonderful job of weaving them together.      <br />Chandler's writing style is pure joy to read....each scene is described in great detail, you feel like you are there.  I love Marlowe's dialogue - tough, sarcastic and to the point.  The BIG SLEEP is a classic mystery any fan of mystery novels should read.	2002-07-30

In my quest to read more classics, I picked up THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD based on a list of 'have to read classics'.  What a great book - I can see why this is a 'must read' book.  <br />The story centers around the life of Janie - her life growing up and her search for true love.  The story is beautifully written - wonderful descriptions!  It took me several pages to get used to the southern dialect of that time - but it is so necessary to help tell the story and draws you in.  As Janie's life unfolds, you begin to feel a part of the story - I cried twice!<br />It a great book - I highly recommend it!	2002-07-20

I started reading the Harry Potter series with my 8-year nephew...and I have to say I am hooked.  The second book in the series is just as good as the first.  HP AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS lives up to the high standards set by the first book.  JK Rowling does a great job of keeping the reader (no matter what age) excited about the book - constantly wondering what is going to happen next.<br />Harry and his friends - Hermoine and Ron - are once again put in the middle of a mystery at Hogswort.  The book begins with an elf-like creature warning Harry not to go back to school...there is danger.  Harry does not believe the creature and decides to go back, after all danger at school is better than living with the Dursleys!  Once at school, strange things start to occur.  As the mystery unravels, secrets and questions left unanswered from the first book are revealed.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone - it is well written and keeps the attention of all readers.  I can't wait to start the 3rd book in the series!	2002-07-15

In my quest to read all of James Patterson's books, I stumbled across this one in a bargin book store.  This book is not the murder mystery he is known for - it's more like SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICOLAS.  <br />MIRACLE ON THE 17TH GREEN is set around golf - but don't worry about really understanding or having an appreciation of the game to read this book.  This is a story about Travis McKinley who discovers he is not happy with his life and decides to make changes...starting with his job.  The short story (only 150 pages) told in James Patterson style (short chapters) begins on one Christmas when Travis golfs the game of his life.  From there his life begins to change - for the better.  He discovers during the next year what really matters to him and his life takes on a clarity it has never had.<br />A good book that proves Patterson can write a good story no matter what the subject!	2002-07-13

I am a huge fan of JP's - I have read all of his Alex Cross and Murder Club books...now I am going back to some of his older books.  If I had started with this book I am not sure I would have read any more of his books.<br />The THOMAS BERRYMAN NUMBER is not very well written.  It tells the story of a hitman through the eyes of several people.  It jumps from 'present' day back to the past and back again.  It tells the same story from different perspectives.  At times this style is very hard to follow.  He introduces too many characters and it is hard to keep up with everyone and their relationship to the story.  The main story line is good but the style of telling the story is confusing and difficult to read.<br />If you want to read James Patterson - try one of his Alex Cross books, they are wonderful.  Skip this one!!	2002-06-22

My 8 year old nephew and I started a 'book club' together - our first book was HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE.  We both enjoyed the book and I have found it a great way to 'bond' with my nephew.<br />HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERCER'S STONE begins with the story of how Harry's parents die and he is sent to live with his aunt and uncle.  Poor Harry is forced to live with people who really don't want him and a cousin Dudley who is very mean and cruel.  After many years of this abuse - Harry finds out that he has magical powers and is being sent to wizard's school.  This is where the story really begins...the adventures of Harry and his friends is a real page turner!  Harry, Ron and Hermoine begin to unravel a mystery about something that is hidden in the school and find out that someone is going to try to steal it.<br />The characters in this book are very well written helping the reader feel like you really know them - my nephew loves Hagrid.<br />I am surprised at how much I enjoyed the book and my nephew is hooked!  We can't wait to order and read the next book in the series.	2002-05-21

A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR is a great beginning to what I hope will be a great series.  This is the first book by Dennis Lehane I have read and I look forward to the next in the series.<br />Patrick Kenzie and Ange Gennaro are PI partners hired to find some missing documents from a senator's office.  Kenzie and Gennaro think this will be a simple case however it becomes more complex with each clue they follow.  The documents turn out to be something many people are looking for, for various reasons.<br />I enjoyed the relationship between Kenzie and Gennaro.  The book is well written - lots of twists and turns, reads quickly and is thoroughly enjoyable.	2002-05-02
US	44429548	R1ZY5ZRMY76B4E	0385503822	782272714	The Summons	Books	3	1	2	N	N	An average attempt...	I have read all of John Grisham's books, this one is fairly average compared to his other works.  THE SUMMONS is about two brothers who receive a 'summons' to see their dying father to discuss the will and arrangements when he passes.  When Ray arrives at the house, he finds his father has passed and he happens upon a large amount of cash hidden in the house.  This happens within the first 20 to 30 pages and the rest of the book is spent telling a story about Ray trying to figure out where the money came from and Ray wrestling with his conscience to decide what to do with the money (should he include it in the estate, share it with others, or keep it for himself).  <br />THE SUMMONS is an easy read and the ending has quite a twist but the rest of the book is a bit flat.	2002-04-29

Within the first few pages, the main character, Sara Linton, discovers a body in the bathroom of the local resturant.  The details of this rape/murder begin to unfold quickly.  Sara is a doctor in town as well as the coroner.  Sara and her ex-husband (the local police chief) work together to figure out the rape/murder.  In trying to solve the murder, the case takes many turns and twists.  In addition to learning more about the case, the author sprinkles in tidbits about the main characters.      <br />BLINDSIGHTED is a great beginning to a series.  Karin Slaughter has created a good group of characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Sara Linton is a strong female character - her relationship with her ex-husband is complicated and central to the book.  I look forward to the next book in the series...	2002-04-22

This is the first book by Alan Jacobson I have read - it was a good book and I am looking forward to reading his first book.<br />THE HUNTED begins with Lauren Chambers upset about her husband's late return from a weekend with his frat buddies.  She goes to the police after 48 hours only to find that they have other more high profile cases to focus in on.  She is pursuaded to go to a Neighborhood Watch meeting to rally the community to help her.  During the meeting she meets a private detective who volunteers to help her.<br />Meanwhile, her husband turns up on the East coast - shot in the leg and he has amnesia.  He cannot remember a thing about his past...and the FBI is looking for him.<br />This provides the foundation for a suspenseful book that reads like a roller coaster - never knowing what is next.  It twists and turns just when you think you know what is going on.  The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is that there are a couple of story items that didn't seem possible.  A great book nonetheless - I would recommend it to others.	2002-04-01

A great tale that effortlessly weaves two storylines.  The first storyline is about three former judges who are in a federal prison because they have broken the law they upheld at one point in their lives.  They are known as the Brethren - holding court in the prison and maintaining the law library.  The Brethren are also involved in a scam which could allow them to get rich quick.<br />The second storyline is about a congressman who runs for president.  With the help of a high ranking CIA official, Aaron Lake is becoming an overnight sensation in political circles.<br />While it seems that these two storylines are unrelated, each storyline begins to weave together.  The Brethren have some information that could hinder Aaron Lake's bid for the White House.  What happens next?  Grisham does a great job of building the suspense - he is a master at providing twists and turns just when you think you have figured out the plot.  This book is another fine example of Grisham's mastery of suspense.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that there are a few items that were left hanging in the story...but a great story nonetheless.	2002-03-29

A great addition to the Murder Club series - the book begins where the last one left off.  Lindsay is back on the job, promoted to Lt. of Homicide.  Her first day on the job is marred by a mass shooting at a church in Oakland.  This murder is only the beginning of a series that seem unrelated, until Lindsay and the Murder Club start putting together the pieces.<br />This book continues to give you more insight about Lindsay, Claire, Jill and Cindy.  Four strong women, each with very different lives.<br />This book is classic James Patterson - a quick read, lots of twists, great character development and an enjoyable book.  I highly recommend it.	2002-03-18

Jack Casey is a man who is haunted by his past - as an FBI profiler he saw the worst in people and also experienced the loss of his wife and child.  Now trying to start a new life in a small town he is confronted by a serial killer like no other.  The Sandman is cruel, gruesome and cunning.  Jack teams up with another ex-FBI profiler Malcolm Fletcher to find the Sandman.  Fletcher is a dark mysterious man with a hidden agenda which adds another level of suspense to the story.<br />The chapters are written like James Patterson (short, tight and full of suspense).

As the story unfold you find out that Norton is one cool cat - he travels, he seems to understand how Peter is feeling, he waits for Peter, he comes when his name is called.

The writing style is very hard to read, the characters are one dimensional and the pace is slow.  <br />Kate is a police sketch artist in the Rape Task Force.  She is troubled by the current serial rapist and becomes friends with one of his victims.  In addition, there is a side story about the relationship between her and her ex-husband.  A love that hasn't faded.  The concept of the story is a good one that gets lost in a very dry, slow, sometimes unreadable style.  I agree with one reviewer that stated the author seems to be British and trying to write dialogue like an American.  The dialogue was too simple.  After reading Cornwell, Grafton and Patterson - this author does not have an understanding of police work and the culture of police detectives.<br />The only reason I finished the book was that it was short (only a little over 200 pages).  It was a struggle to complete it.	2001-12-16

Each bank robbery is more violent than the next.  Alex works with a new FBI partner, Betsy.  She is a strong character and quickly Alex recognizes her talents.  The book has a lot of twists and the ending provides quite a cliff hanger.  I can wait until I read Violets are Blue.	2001-12-10

What a great book - it starts with a bang and keeps on going!<br />There is a vicious murder in San Francisco that looks a lot like a previous case of Alex's.  So, he is off the SF to help with the investigation.  This case is really creepy.  As the case heats up and more murders occur, he is forced to travel from place to place gathering critical evidence.  Patterson does a great job of building the tension and getting the reader wrapped up in the story.  After reading about 100 pages I didn't want to put it down.  It was a compelling and very well written book.  My reason for taking one star away is that Alex is becoming predictable with his 'partners'.  Once again he is partnered with a strong female character.  Once again he finds he has romantic feeling for her.  It seems a little strange that he keeps getting the same types of female partners case after case.<br />In addition, the Mastermind is back and tormenting Alex Cross on a daily basis.  Taunting him and challenging him.  During this story line I found out a lot about past cases and more about Alex Cross.  This story line is mixed very well with the main story and keeps you guessing.<br />Great book...I would highly recommend it.	2001-12-10

I picked up Hide and Seek expecting great things - after all, his Alex Cross series is great; I loved 1st to Die; and thought Suzanne's Diary for Nicolas was a brave move into general fiction.  Well, I was disappointed!<br />The book is about Maggie Bradford and her past loves.  Within several chapters you find out she has 'murdered' several past husbands and lovers.  The book flips between her in jail, her past husbands and their background, her past, and what has happened to get her arrested for murder.<br />This book is not written well.  It jumps back and forth so much between current day and past as well as various characters that it is hard to keep up with what's going on.  The characters are not well developed - they are one dimensional and flat.  The story is predictable and boring.  I only stuck with the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  Since this is an early James Patterson, perhaps we can chalk this book up to inexperience.  Luckily he has learned from his mistakes and is now producing great books....<br />Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this book to others...unless you want to compare his earlier work to his current masterpieces of mystery/suspense.	2001-10-17

She and her niece Lucy work together on trying to unravel the mystery.  For those who follow the series, Carrie Grethen is back and badder than ever.

JP does a great job of writing about two seemingly unrelated serial murderers - like a tennis game the stories volley back and forth.  A little about the child murders, a little about the Jack and Jill murders.  Alex Cross is stuck trying to solve both of these at the same time.  Alex is torn between the child murders that are happening in his neighborhood and the Jack and Jill murders that are gaining national attention. Alex is asked to join the task force at the White House to solve the Jack and Jill murders because the murderers have made threats against the president.  These stories are exciting and have twists that keep you on the edge of your seat!  Not until the end of the book do you begin to see it all come together and understand the real motivation of the murderers.<br />If you want a great thriller...read this book!	2001-10-10

She never showed up to pick up their daughter.  Gus is a powerful attorney who has spent more time on his career rather than his family.  As he waits for word on his wife, he begins to realize how much he has missed about his wife and daughter.  He begins to see the small changes that have taken place in his wife's behavior over the past several months.  Has his wife left him?  Has she been kidnapped?  Or worse murdered?  The FBI takes an interest in the case and Andie is assigned to the case.  She is a young, ambitious agent who begins to unravel the case.

Pender is a soon-to-retire agent that is making this case his last hoorah, he is determined to find Max.  Max has been caught during a routine traffic stop and Irene has been assigned by the courts to evaluate Max.  The serial killer has multiple personality disorder and during the course of the book you learn about how this disorder works.

These stories begin to weave together and soon April and Dr Frank are once again working together to solve the mystery.  <br />This venture is a little too predictable, about 1/3 of the way through I had figured out who was committing the murders.  The only reason I stayed with the book is to confirm my hunch and find out why.  For this reason, the book didn't meet my expectations.    <br />I really enjoy the chemistry of the characters - April and her partner Mike as well as Jason.  Leslie Glass has been able to write strong characters and draw the reader into their lives.  I will probably try one more book by LG before I give up...	2001-08-06
US	44429548	R3V28369IDBFJ	1890367273	507792544	PMP Exam: Practice Test and Study Guide	Books	4	9	9	N	N	Definitely helps...	I just passed the PMP exam and this book helped me in preparing.  This book helps by providing sample test questions and it definitely helped me in studying for the PMP exam.  I found a few aspects of this book particularly helpful... 1) At the beginning of each section it provides a summary of topics that the PMP candidate should know about, this helped me determine which subjects I knew and which ones I needed to gather more information on.  2) The sample questions cover materials not in the PMBOK - this is very helpful since the PMP exam expects candidates to be well versed in PM concepts not just the PMBOK.<br />I would recommend this book as a good tool for preparing for the PMP.  I used it as a 'final' test during my last week of preparation, taking all the exams back-to-back to determine which areas I needed to focus my last studying days on.	2001-08-04
US	44429548	RQ4KWT2O37TTF	1890367141	468041633	PMP challenge	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Great studying tool	I just passed the PMP exam and it was in some part due to the materials found in this book.  First, I love the format of the book...flash cards on the go.  The book is comprised of chapters for each of the process areas and each chapter contains 60 questions and answers regarding the materials.  The 60 questions/answers are formatted like flash cards which allows you to quiz yourself...and the spiral bound style allows you to flip through them easily.  Second, this book provides information which is not covered in the PMBOK but you need to know in order to pass the test (such as various quality management concepts, communication styles, etc).  <br />I found this book extremely helpful and would recommend it to anyone studying for the exam.	2001-08-04

The style of the questions is not anything like the exam and the materials focused mainly on the PMBOK rather than a wider view of all PM concepts. I would not recommend spending the money for this book...rather spend you money on the ESI materials and sample tests.<br />UPDATE:<br />The ESI materials are:<br />PMP CHALLENGE by Ward (published by ESI International)<br />PMP EXAM: PRACTICE TEST by Ward (also published by ESI)	2001-08-04

This book provides insight regarding the hot topics to know for the exam, what areas of the PMBOK are more important than others, tips and techniques for taking the exam and provides good supplementary information that you won't find in the PMBOK but is important to passing the test.  I used this book along with the PMBOK and a few of the ESI materials and I feel the combination helped me pass the test on my first try.  I highly recommend this book if you are trying to study for the test on your own (i.e. not taking any seminars or PMI work groups)...this really helps focus your attention on the major components of the test and gives you some insight about the test structure.	2001-08-04
US	44429548	R3HO9HZ8Y0H7VP	0316969443	706464487	Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas	Books	4	10	12	N	N	Not James Patterson's normal genre	Okay, let's begin with...this is not the mystery thriller you might expect from James Patterson. This is not an Alex Cross book...it is very different and worth the time to read. I loved the book! <br />It's a wonderful story about a women (Katie) who has fallen in love with a man (Matt). Suddenly one night, he breaks off their relationship and has a diary delivered to her. The diary is written by a lady named Suzanne for her son Nicolas and it reveals to Katie secrets about Matt. Katie discovers who Matt really is, his past as well as learns some value life lessons that help her make some critical life decisions of her own. I gave it 4 stars because it is a bit sappy at times...but overall this is a really good book. <br />I applaud James Patterson for writing a book that is outside of his 'comfort zone' and I think he did a really good job. This novel definitely exhibits James Patterson's talent for weaving intrigue into the story (who is Suzanne, what is Matt's secret). Also, it is a quick and easy read (like JP's other books it has short chapters that clip along at a fast pace). I recommend this book, however keep in mind this is unlike any other JP book.	2001-07-28

I thought I would never learn the terms and poses - and would have to ditch my tapes.<br />This book saved me!!!  It provided step by step guides to each pose - visually so that you can walk yourself through the steps to acheive the position.  It's a great first step to learning the basics.  With this foundation I am now ready to tune into the tapes I have purchased and truly experience yoga!!!	2001-06-13

It provided 'real life' examples of things that were done right as well as lessons to be learned by web sites that had done things wrong.  The book was very easy to read and very applicable to the business world.  <br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who want to design a website that keeps the user in mind!!	2001-06-13

The class guided participants through the book.  This book provided valuable insight on traits and characteristics that I have and the types of careers I am best suited for.  As part of the book, the reader does a Myers-Briggs test to determine their personality type.  I have done Myers-Briggs testing in the past but never with the explanation about each type that this book provides.  The book provides an write-up about each type - allowing those of us who cross types to hone into the exact type we are.  Based on this, the reader can then read the career section devoted to their type.  I found out that I am in the right career - however I am not using my strengths and preferences correctly.<br />This book provides great insight...I recommend it to anyone trying to determine their entry-level career or for those of us facing 'mid life' career dilemmas.	2001-06-13

They are quick reads, each giving me a better sense of who Kinsey is and I love the way all mysteries are solved by the end of the book.  This one falls short of my expectation for wrapping up the mystery into a nice neat package at the end.  I felt like I was missing a chapter...<br />All in all, the book was good.  The main plot is about Kinsey trying to determine what happened to a doctor who has been missing for nine weeks.  She discovers the doctor has quite a few dilemmas in his life - one ex-wife who seems to have never gotten over him, new wife and child who require a lot of his time, a sticky situation at the hospital he manages and friends who make better enemies.  In addition, Kinsey is loosing her office space and needs to find another office.  She happens upon a great little office, perfect locations, completely remodeled, and reasonably priced - almost too good to be true.  Well, it is!  This scenario provides the back drop for another plot - two brothers from Texas who are accused of murdering their parents.  Grafton does a good job of weaving the two plots effortlessly through the book.  I felt like the second plot (with the two brothers) was presented and closed out better than the main plot.<br />I always look forward to another Kinsey Millhone saga - this one was worth the wait and I highly recommend it to other fans.  My only hope is that Sue Grafton goes back to neatly tying up her mysteries (with the trademark Kinsey 'final report').	2001-06-09

I really enjoyed the book, the characters were well defined and the plot was exciting and twisted.  April Woo is a great character - strong, independent and smart!  Other reviewers have correctly compared this author to Thomas Harris (Hannibal series) - April is similar to Clarice, the serial killer plot is well thought out and moves at a great pace.  <br />I have already purchased Hanging Time and can't wait to get started!	2001-05-16

In this adventure Alex must find a serial killer who is involved in a computer role playing game.  Alex is also facing increased pressures at work with a boss that doesn't want him around anymore.  However, Alex has found the love of his life...Christine.<br />As usual, JPatterson does a great job of weaving each of these story lines and providing enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The last 100 pages is so intense, you can't put it down!!!	2001-05-09

It's a very thin book (a little over 100 pages) and a quick read.  I found the story to be very insightful - while the story is about farm animals...the behaviors were very analogous to humans.  The story begins with a bunch of farm animals plotting the overthrow of a farm.  They are able to take the farm over and kick out the farmer and his family.  I loved following the progress of the animals - how they work together, their organizational evolution and power struggles.  I found myself comparing the story to corporate America.  This was a great book!!	2001-04-30

I love when a book raises serious social questions (the plight of the homeless) and more importantly sways my thoughts and opinions.  This book did a great job of not only telling a compelling story about one lawyer's journey from his high powered attorney position with a large firm to a position with a small 'socially conscience' firm.  I found the message of the book more compelling and thought provoking than any of Grisham's other books.	2001-04-30

I have served on 6 to 8 juries in the past and it really makes me wonder if one person could sway an entire group.<br />Grisham does a good job of setting up the case - the various parties and their stake in the game.  The book weaves the tale of one person who is placed on the jury and little by little gains the trust of the group.  His role is to sway to group to vote a certain way - it's wonder to watch how the story unfolds and find out how he is able to manipulate a diverse group of people.  Good book!!	2001-04-30

What would the world be like without books??  This story gives us some insight into what it might be like... and it's pretty scary.  It is definitely food for thought regarding censorship.<br />The book paints a dim and scary picture of a future society where all books have been banned.  Firemen no longer fight fires, the set them to destroy houses found to have books.  With the removal of books, people have turned their attentions to TV and as a result the general population is unable to think for themselves and their minds have turned to mush.  The main character begins to challenge these concepts of censorship after meeting a young teen-ager who stirs his curiousity.  The more he thinks about and challenges the 'norms' of society his world is turned upside down.<br />This book really makes you think about censorship and where it can lead.  The book is very relevant to the debate going on about censoring today's music (as well as books, tv and movies).  You can't put limits on creativity and self expression without limiting the society as a whole.	2001-04-30

I anxiously awaited the arrival of the next Hannibal book, after reading Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs.  The book starts out with a bang - grabbed my attention immediately.  Clarice is facing some hard times at the FBI...she is in trouble.  Harris does a really good job of drawing me into the situation.  However, the next section of the book comes to a grinding halt.  It is almost like this section of the book is written by someone else.  After I finally got through that section - the last part of the book clips along (I guess this is were Harris takes over the writing again!).  <br />My only disappointment with the book is the ending - without giving it away, it is a very unlikely situation.	2001-04-26

Readers should beware - you really should read the rest of the series before this one.  This book relies on the reader knowing the history of Kay and the other characters.
