The house is modern, amazing, and captures the imagination of the entire neighborhood. What no one knows, however, is just what the house has in store for this neighborhood.

Grace is dying of breast cancer, and they move to a small cottage by the sea during her last few weeks.  Grainne is terrified of losing her mother and retreats.  The only way the two of them communicate at the end of Grace's life is through notes and poetry that they leave one another on the refrigerator door.<br />After Grace's death, Grace's mother, Cliona, comes to fetch Grainne and take her back to Ireland, back to the family that Grace took Grainne from when Grainne was only three years old.

Lonely and angry, Grainne clings to the only thing she has control over: her hunger.  She wills herself not to eat, because as long as she is hungry, she can't feel the pain of her mother's death.  Grainne waits to meet her father, who has also retreated, as he is terrified of meeting his daughter.<br />Told through the voices of Grainne, Grace, and Cliona, this story shares two powerful mother/daughter relationships, and gives the reader insight to both sides of the relationship.	2003-04-04

Michael Cunningham is a true master of prose, a master at weaving a wonderful story.<br />The Hours is the story of three women, living out one day in their particular time line.  Virginia Woolf is struggling with a new story, what will become Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown, living in Los Angeles in 1949, is immersed in her reading of Mrs. Dalloway, and struggling with her feelings toward her husband, her son, and her life in general.  Clarissa Vaughn, living in present day Greenwich Village, is occupied with a party she is giving for her dearest friend, a writer who has AIDS.<br />The author weaves the stories of these three women together with grace and affection.  Although they all live at different times, their stories resonate, and at the end, they come together in unexpected ways.  These women are very real, and their struggles, their loves, and their lives are very realistic.  <br />I don't think you can read this novel and not be changed in some way.  I don't think you can read this novel and not look at life differently when you are finished with it.<br />Only one suggestion: read Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf, first, before reading The Hours.  It will enrich your reading experience.	2003-01-16

She is the youngest of three children, with a span of about 9 years between her sister and herself.  In the course of the memoir, Zippy describes her small town, the crabby owner of the corner drugstore, the mean lady down the street, her mother's book addiction, her father's &quot;creative&quot; employment, attachments to various animals, her unpopularity with her teachers, and her brother and sister's feuding.<br />A central theme throughout the book is Zippy's pre-occupation with her faith.  Raised a Quaker, Zippy spends a good deal of time trying to figure out how and what to believe.  The various excuses she uses to try to get out of going to church are very funny!<br />An insightful book, more than just a vehicle for laughter.

I found this a fascinating read, but more of a character study of dysfunction than a mystery.<br />At the heart of this story is Jock, also known as Jeff or Jerry, a ne'er do well always looking for a free lunch.  His girlfriend du jour is always well-off, and willing to keep him.<br />The three women at the forefront of this novel have very little in common, except that they all have fallen head over heels for Jock, or Jerry, or whatever he decides his name is!  What we do discover about these women, and those people who are close to them, are the various dysfunctions and quirks that manifest themselves as the story progresses.<br />I don't think I would characterize this book as a mystery, as there is very little kept secret from the reader.  As a novel, however, it is very good, and Rendell's depictions of her characters are fascinating.	2002-09-16

When I picked this one up, I was intrigued.  It was well worth the time!<BR>A Moveable Feast is a lush account of life in Paris in the early 20s.  Hemingway writes about life as a young writer struggling to hone his craft.  <BR>His descriptions of life in the cafes, at the race track, and traveling through Europe are vivid and full of life.  He loved his life as a poor, struggling writer, and this comes through so honestly.<br />Name dropping is taken to a new level as he talks about his friendships with Stein, Picasso, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.  <BR>This is an excellent introduction to Hemingway, and also to Fitzgerald, as reading A Moveable Feast helped me to understand Fitzgerald in greater depth.	2002-03-13

Okay, people, get over the margins and stop whining that the book isn't long enough!  Ms. Karon had stated, long before A Common Life was published, that it would be a much shorter novel than her others, and it was only about the wedding of Fr. Tim and Cynthia, and that there will be two more Mitford novels after this one.  And that doesn't include the quote book and the bedside companion that are coming out this fall. This is a lovely story about the wedding of Father Tim and Cynthia.  Real Mitford fans have been dying to know what happened at the wedding, and Ms. Karon has not disappointed!!!  What is extra special about this story is that we get a glimpse into what the other Mitford citizens are thinking during this time.  This story is a treat, and it's fun to have Miss Sadie with us again, too!  So get over the wide margins, get over the blank pages between the chapters, and just enjoy the story for what it is!

I found this book comprehensive as well as entertaining!  Calendar is thorough review of World History, from pre-Egyptian to the present day.  Mr. Duncan teaches his reader about the way humans have tried to keep track of time from early man to the present time, and he does this in a way that  is both informative and entertaining.  He does not talk down to his  readers, instead, he tells his reader a story of how and why we have such a  desire to control time.  It is fascinating to see how man has tried to  measure the length of a year, and how, in each century, he's gotten just a  little bit closer.  You will never look at the Calendar or your clocks the  same way again!	2000-04-27
