US	52722521	R1TC10SH06VS94	0316172324	968642731	Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking	Books	4	763	862	N	N	Not an idea - a series of curious New Yorker articles	The mistake was too try and get all of these wild animals onto the same boat. The book a series of semi-socio-scientific articles on insight and intuition. It is not a cohesive theory.  <br /> <br />The writing is enjoyable - I read the most of it in a single plane flight. Some of the insights provide building blocks for understanding how certain professionals (people who practice a subject or skill for many years) are able to develop an additional sense about things -- gamblers, art curators, policemen. They are essentially seeing something that doesn't register at the conscious-level but provides them a gut-feel about the thing. Actually, I should say that these articles are how this MIGHT be happening - it's more speculation based on the diverse theories of a number of different researchers. Individually the stories and ideas are believable. Unfortuately, Gladwell fumbles in trying take them into some unified theory that is comprehensible let alone cohesive -- at times you wonder \\"where is he going with this?\\". Without that thread the indivudal beads get lost and fade into memory as clever ideas...and not much more. Without confidence in the grand idea, the individual pieces begin to feel simply exploratory. It's a shame because there are some remarkable ideas. He's a good documenter of curiousities of research (sort of like a Ken Burns is to historical things) so the storytelling is good enough for entertainment. Another reviewer likened it the addage about Chinese food, tasty but hungry an hour later. I agree. Flawed but still some interesting ideas to puzzle over.	2005-01-29

Racked by guilt and self-certainty, waves of supreme confidence and landslides of self-doubt, their everyday incidents will have you laughing aloud. Fans of Basil Faulty or P. G. Wodehouse and like British-humor will delight in the characters and their very digestible episodes. Each book is quite short (~120 pages) and you'll probably end up with all three.	2004-12-30
US	52722521	R3TXES7QWWHZGG	0449004023	270954632	Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Worked amazingly well...for our child.	It's our first, so we have only one experience to provide. He's now 3 months old and sleeping through the night -- 7pm to 6am with one wake up around 2am. It's been pretty consistent for a few weeks. I believe parents who adopt the practices of this book EARLY ON will feel a lot less pain than those who do it later. We've been focused on a few basics: <br />1) getting him down by 9am for the morning nap (this is the pacesetter for the whole day) <br />2) making sure he doesn't stay awake more than 2 hrs - otherwise the meltdown begins and pretty much will continue throughout<br />3) being consistent about getting him down -- we used to only put him in crib ONLY when he was completely asleep. We switched early on to putting him in the crib when he was still awake, but in a quiet mood. Either method (supposedly) works, you just have to pick one or the other. <br />4) finding the right ways to get him to calm down a few minutes before we're going to put him in the crib -- this is the creative part that's probably very different for every baby + parent. <br />5) trying to maintain that schedule even on vacations, weekends and trips (this is the tough one).<br />We count ourselves lucky that our baby has gone along with this (thus far), but I will say that without this approach we would have definately been in trouble. These basic consistencies mean so much to a creature that is reliant on you to provide clear cues. We're so often tied up with our own emotions and personal reactions, that in truth we're not thinking about them. <br />We have had many friends that are discovering this with their second kids, and they can't believe how much headache they endured with their first. <br />I sympathize with the parents who feel that later 'cry it out' aspects of the approach seem cruel. We haven't hit that bump, but I suspect I will be hard. Again, I can't imagine any approach would work for 2/3rds of the people in the world, so I thing everyone has to use their judgement whether this is working for their child and themselves. <br />An aside - the book is not well written. The editor could have done a far better job helping take what is very valuable content and made it much clearer.	2004-01-05

The bulk of the book is two page overviews of 75 leading firms, comprising a broad competitive landscape. Though there is good data on these companies and some analysis of their functionality/proposition, this does not have the teeth of an analysts report nor provides deep insight into their business models or viability (FYI, that would be a lot to ask). Nonetheless, for anybody seriously trying to make sense of the changes going on, this is a very good start. For those involved in the business, it is pretty much essential if for no other reason than to keep straight the myriad of offerings containing the word 'home'. <br />The other essays are interesting, some informative because they are written by insiders and influentials, but I found more of the value in the company profiles (cheaper than a pass to Real Connect). Lastly, because of changes in the industry, this is a perishable good. I'd recommend buying it sooner rather than later. For a good overview of the last period of real estate and technology, the author's previous title (R.E. Confronts Reality) provides good context.	2000-12-06

However, the changes in the last 12 mos have been a watershed for technology adoption. 40% of all consumers are now beginning their real estate research online and leading brokers and agents are not waiting around to see what happens. This book is worth the money if you want background and context (analysts, new technology and sevice companies, new industry professionals) but I would look elsewhere for specific answers.	2000-10-28

Stitched and perfect-bound to endure many one-handed readings, drops and spills. Used this for a few Cycladian islands and Athens, on a mid-level budget and was as satisfied as can be. Great recommendations -- what to do and what is a waste of time (very helpful) and they seem to find a number of gems off the beaten path. I can't say enough about the maps which are included for every island and most towns. Every other guide seems to think that this is non-essential information, leaving you to hunt for a local map at your ports of call. Buy this ahead of planning the trip as their direction and suggestions may have a significant impact on your itinerary.	2000-09-25

Though I was only a young bystander. the authors managed to unearth the  mythical names, long desolate locations, and key events of the day. WBMX  Jams on Saturday and Sunday mornings going down to Maxwell street, where  last night's pressings were available on too thin, recycled vinyl  (sometimes with pieces of gym shoe in them).

Though many of these have been previously published, the assembly is worth price of the  book. This will be is valuable for anybody involved in high-level decision  making on mission-critical (and smaller) IT/Internet software projects. If  you want to educate your boss on why you can't begin work without clear  objectives, scope, senior management involvement, etc., a few of these  stories should clear his/her head. All the B-to-B internet hubs run by  consortia should read this or be ready to end up in vol II.	2000-06-29

We've made some very successful meals of them and 1) they are relatively quick, 2) easy in that they require only a handful of ingredients, 3) taste better than most decent restaurants. The  cover dish -- linguine with shrimp and cream -- is something I'll make over  and over; the salmon with capers and anchovies had me pounding the table;  and the squash risotto will probably replace potatos forever. I know these  sound a bit extravagant -- they are -- but the recipies are not  intimidating. If you're comfortable with a skillet you should be fine.  Great addition to a shelf of Italian cookbooks and the one that finally  took me beyond pasta dishes. Oh but, I also highly recommend the author's  Pasta Cookbook.	2000-06-25

However, I have gotten more use out of this book than the other 5 dictionaries behind simply because I can bring it everywhere. Though some  may find this a bit odd, I basically bring it on vacation as a second book  -- especially in Europe where questions about them seem to crop up.  So  many more words will get hunted with this book because it will be handy  when you need it.	2000-06-18

Though geared towards the major legal issues involved in starting a company, this book covers many of the essentials of  beginning and structuring a business far better than most of the other  books on financing or building start-ups. I've at least looked through a  dozen books on the subject and none has had better, more explicit guidance  on dividing founder's equity, options, funding relationship and so much  more. I cannot recommend this book highly enough; you'll be at a  disadvantage without it. You can view other reviews of entrepreneur books  via my reviewer profile.	2000-06-15

But the real story is about the complicated and ultimately uncontrolable process of bringing innovations to market. Though  Xerox had the option to take a first crack at turning these into products,  a combination of forces made it such that companies like Apple, 3Com,  Microsoft and others were able to truly turn these inventions into the  enormous industry it is today.

Such a great book that I read it one afternoon. For any entrepreneur, the author's guidance is the best you can find -- clear, experienced and, more than anything, critically honest. With so much energy and money whirling  about, I can think of no better 150 pages that cuts through the noise and  gets to the creativity that has made Silicon Valley a place of innovation.  <br />Lastly, there is also wonderfully practical advice in this story. I have  advised numerous start-ups in developing business plans and pitchs, this  has as good of a template as there is.	2000-05-15

The author tries to summarize key points at the end of each chapter, in order to support its positioning as a  business book. I can't say that the book is useful in any tactical sense,  but I will say that after finishing it I was inspired by the  entrepreneurial energy that comes from the overall narative. Good to get  you charged up to start a company, but not enough detail to run it.	2000-05-14

What makes this different is that 1) it has solid research behind it and 2) the  writers have successfully organized it to be read as a compelling narrative  AND to be usable as a reference. It was at the core of our own  organization's effort to discover and articulate our values, which in turn  helped us focus as we rapidly grew from a small to medium sized company.  <br />I also bought the audio cassette as a bit of crutch to get through it  the first time. Though it requires your attention and a little rewinding, I  found this a great way to both get the core concepts to sink in and, since  then, to refresh my memory on occasion. <br />Last note. I have had the  opportunity to work with two of the mentioned 'Visionary' companies  described in the book and can attest to their substantive cultural  difference and the impact it has on the motivation and focus of their  people. Highly recommended for a wide range of readers.	2000-05-09

The only criteria is to check your sensitivity at the door re: anything you hold dear or sacred -- it will eventually be mocked. A landmark in humor  similar to Monty Python in the 70's but the content will appeal to a much  broader audience (you do not, for example, need a particular affection for  a British-centric view). <br />You will find it hard to stop reading this but  I do recommend you pace yourself. After about a dozen pages the absurdity  begins to seem patterned and the punch diminishes. Take it in doses, maybe  put it in the bathroom (as long as don't mind people wondering what sends  you into hysterics every time you go in there). <br />If you like this you  will also enjoy This American Life's CD (I forget the name) or Billy  Collins' CD The Best Cigarette.	2000-05-09

I would contend  that there is a profound gem hidden early in the book regarding the concept  of 'value networks'. (I'm sure some org behavior folks have thought about  this but few people in the strategy -- esp. mgmt or change consulting --  have taken this to heart.) Organizations are a network of structural  relationships between stakeholders (employees, suppliers, investors,  customers, et al) that is highly inflexible (this is what creates the  consistency necessary large orgs and their quality expectations,  requirements). When organzations try to do something new, this network of  relationships often keeps change in check. Forget the tech angle, this is  about companies, momentum and inflexibility and how most companies can't  change or dramatically evolve without leadership that recognizes that the  entire network must be primed to accepted radical transformation and its  requisite ambiguity (e.g., GE and Gerstner or  Maytag and Lloyd Ward).
