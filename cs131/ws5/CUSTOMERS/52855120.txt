It is almost too beautiful to read - a veritable feast for the eyes - but too compelling not to. It is a graphic exploration of how art and typography historically have combined to excite, involve, and motivate the reader. It is also a sad  reminder that most books today use only one or two plain fonts in block after unvarying block of black ink on white paper. <br /> <br />What makes this book an even greater marvel is that Kirschenbaum created it all on her home computer using four gigabytes of RAM. Astonishing! If she can do it, maybe other, upcoming writers will take up the challenge and create a publishing renascence. <br /> <br />The book is not only an artistic gem but also a cultural and literary treasure trove. It makes a wonderful gift ... but be sure you keep a copy for yourself. <br />	2005-01-29

In doing so, it covers the interpersonal basis of social anxiety and looks at how self-presentation, expectancies, self-efficacy, interpersonal behavior, and motivation contribute to the subjective aspects of social anxiety - physiology, cognition, and emotion. While it addresses the experience and treatment of this condition, it should not be thought of as a therapeutic workbook or guide to treatment. Instead, it is a thorough, thoughtful, and informative review of the theory of and research literature on the causes of this pervasive and painful problem.	2004-08-25

It is also a beautifully-written book that is a delight to read. It is a cross between &quot;A Kick in the Seat of the Pants&quot; and anything by Peter Drucker. Peppered with Rorschach-like drawings to jump-start a manager's creative problem-solving juices and expand her/his decision-making perspective, the book presents diverse, innovative, on-point, in-depth examples of proven methods to reverse stalls (stallbusters). What do &quot;Tinkers to Evers to Chance,&quot; Tiger Woods, stand-up desks, and Grey Poupon have in common? Find out. But you don't have to be a manager to benefit from this book. The extra added bonus is that its principles and methods are universally applicable to our interactions with others in all aspects of our lives. But if you are a bottom-line conscious business person, The 2,000 Percent Solution is an absolute must-read.	2003-09-04

To be a parent of a teen is to ride a roller coaster of raging hormones. As a result, it sometimes seems nearly impossible to understand what they're going through, what they want and need, and know how to respond to it all. One minute they're pushing you away; the next, they're pushing the envelope with their risky behaviors. This leaves parents confused, pulling out their hair, wondering when to hang in, hold on, or let go.<br />What makes this collection of warm, funny, and inspirational real-life essays by parents of teens so great is that it provides much-needed insight and support in this area. How you can influence your teens without interfering with their finding their own identity. How you can help them feel safe and secure, knowing their family is their anchor, even as they explore new areas. It shows that you CAN understand them and reconnect with them as you ride this coaster together. And, most importantly, it challenges the negative teen stereotypes and reassures you that \\"teens are NOT a disease.\\"<br />Cooke and Kendrick, who are both personal and professional teen experts, have created a book that is informative and useful for anyone who deals with teens, from parents to grandparents to teachers, and even to teens themselves - with or without \\"nose rings.\\" I heartily recommend this book!	2003-04-14

You learn about planning the project, budgeting, designing, scripting, packaging, recording, editing, duplicating, labeling, different modes of selling, and what the future may hold. It tells you what to do and what not to do and why.   <br />What I particularly like is how Byers provides you with a flowchart of all that needs to be done and in what order then spends the rest of the book detailing the process in a logical, sequential, and step-by-step fashion. There are examples and illustrations galore to clarify her points. Also she provides appendices which are loaded with resources, fill-informs, and templates so that you have everything you need to actually start the process rolling.

That many of the personal and professional problems we experience everyday are the result of inadequate communication skills, lack of trust and self-disclosure, and inability to manage conflicts, anger, and stress.<br />Of special significance to more than half of the US population who report being shy, the author acknowledges the sometimes devastating impact of social fears on relationships and includes a section on working through shyness.<br />While the book is about skill building, it isn't just an exercise book. On the contrary, it smartly integrates psychological research data, theory, and exercises into a thought-provoking, readable volume. The approach is get-out-there-and-do-it experiential learning. Even though &quot;Reaching Out&quot; is an excellent text for classroom use, it is also very informative, practical, and useful for the self-help reader.	2001-07-29

I thought it would be meaningful quotations from interviews with the &quot;100 celebrities&quot; of its title who had experienced real shyness, overcome it, and were &quot;sharing their secrets.&quot; Instead it's a combination of responses to questions and excerpts from books which are not necessarily sharing secrets or even about shyness per se. In fact, one individual says point-blank, &quot;Never been shy!&quot; To make matters worse, the quotations are often neither instructive nor inspiring.<br />However, this is not to say that the book isn't useful. Shy and socially anxious people will likely identify with those whose words appear. It's often important for those of us with social fears to discover that others, especially those in the public eye, share our problem. Furthermore, there are a few instances where people like Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's, offer suggestions which worked for them, relate a relevant experience, or say something poignant or significant.<br />Not a primer on social anxiety or &quot;Chicken Soup for the Shy Soul,&quot; this small volume is primarily a thinking-of-you gift book.	2001-06-30

In response to an irritation, the oyster encases the particle in a smooth, protective coating, thus providing itself both relief and a thing of value. So too this book will assist anyone with a mood disorder to create relief and their own emotional pearl.<br />This cognitive workbook helps the anxiety sufferer alleviate mood problems as well as reduce stress, solve problems, and improve self-esteem. It does this by helping the reader identify thoughts, moods, behaviors, and physiological reactions; test usefulness of those responses; and change thinking patterns which are ineffective or dysfunctional.<br />However, because there is less information on how cognitions, emotions, behaviors, and physiological reactions relate to anxiety or depression than might be useful for greater self-understanding, I think this good book is, in many instances, better as an adjunct to psychotherapy than as a strictly self-help vehicle.	2001-06-26

The area of study encompasses a wide array of topics, such as attitudes, person perception, attention, motivation, self-presentation, memory processing of social information, inference, foundations of emotion, stereotyping, and self-regulation. This book critically evaluates all social cognition theories, evidence, and applications and does it in a readable style.<br />Well-organized, the book is divided into four sections. Section one deals with the &quot;what&quot; of social cognition; two, with the &quot;how&quot;; three, with the cross-fertilization of cognitive psychology and social psychology; and four, with the applications of social cognition research to the real world.<br />Without question &quot;Social Cognition&quot; is the standard, state-of-the-art resource for providing a road map to the fullest and clearest understanding of not only social thinking processes but also the creatures who do the processing.	2001-06-12

When the author uses examples to show how people sabotage or build their own success, it works well. The biggest problem is that it is really a long article or pamphlet stretched to short-book length with larger print and lots of blank pages adding to the page count. Also some of the material on how the principle works comes across as contrived  as if trying to sound scientific, which is unnecessary. Perhaps what might been more informative and useful would have been a discussion of the psychological undepinnings of the principle. There is some interesting writing and research on forming success attitudes and making commitments which could have been incorporated and applied to give it more substance. <br />People do need to know about the principle and the commitment necessary to make any achievement possible. In October 2001 there will be a new edition. I hope this upcoming volume does more justice to this fascinating topic.	2001-06-12

Through ongoing case histories it demonstrates assessment and treatment possibilities. Furthermore, it has appendices containing useful resources for both adults and children. It might have been useful, however, for the book to have provided readers with in-depth applications of these techniques and principles in specific social areas that shy and socially anxious people often report as important. These include meeting people, dating, making an impression, giving reports, using the telephone, handling meetings, surviving job interviews, and &quot;coming out&quot; about their condition. Research has shown that frequently sufferers also need social-effectiveness skills training in order to recovery more quickly and satisfactorily. Overall, readers will find this book well-done, interesting to read, with useful information and helpful strategies.	2001-06-09

As one who suffered from both for years, I can tell you this book provides you with everything you need to know to overcome this form of performance anxiety.<br />Starting with what &quot;bashful bladder syndrome&quot; is, it takes the reader through its causes, different treatment approaches, what to expect from the medical community, and how to gain support from family, intimates, and friends.

This may be especially true for many of the over 20 million individuals in the US alone who suffer from social anxiety disorder - a fear of  being negatively evaluated and humiliated in social situations -  who suffer from this painful and embarrassing disorder as well. <br />Given that the diseased-based biomedical model can't adequately account for these gastrointestinal symptoms and their psychological effects, it is gratifying to see an empirically-supported cognitive-behavioral treatment for IBS which is effective.<br />In addition to its gender and social context issues, its comprehensive set of treatment recommendations includes emphasis on coping with shame, anger, assertiveness, self-efficacy, social approval, perfectionism, control, self-nuturance, and performance anxiety. To assist the therapist in facilitating the client's learning, the book also includes recommendations, troubleshooting guides, common problems and myths, case histories, scripts, and client-therapist dialogues.<br />This is an excellent volume on a condition which heretofore has received little attention.	2001-06-09
