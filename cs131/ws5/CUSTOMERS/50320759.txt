In her easy reading voice, DiAnn Mills presents an intense fictional tale of a young Sudanese girl's rescue from slave traders. Ms Mills has skillfully crafted three very unique and diametrically opposite characters: Dr. Larson Kerr, an American physician; Paul Farid, a Christian Arab who flies for FTW (Feed the World); and Colonel Ben Alier, a leader of the SPLA (Sudanese People's Liberation Army) guerilla forces. <br /> <br />Larson, Paul, and Ben also wrestle with personal spiritual wars as they search for Ben's sister, Rachel. Paul, like his Biblical namesake, is guilt-ridden by his persecution of the Sudanese Christians before he renounced his royal family. A bitter Larson is running from her childhood faith and turning a deaf ear to a God who allows bad things to happen to good people. Ben's rage at the atrocities against his people is at constant odds with his Christian faith.  <br /> <br />Ben and Larson openly distrust all Arabs, and Paul must constantly strive to prove himself at the same time keeping his ties to the Khartoum's Islamic government from Larson. Because of their individual desire to provide hope for the people of Sudan, the three set aside their prejudices and form a most unlikely alliance to execute a daring rescue of Rachel. And, in the process, find themselves caught in a tenuous love triangle.  <br />Simultaneously, the reader follows the struggles of Nyok, the young boy Ben has assigned as Larson's \\"warrior-protector.\\" Larson and Paul believe Nyok should get an education, Ben believes he should fight with the SPLA. Nyok must determine how God wants to use him to bring peace to his beloved southern Sudan. Clearly, Ms Mills uses Nyok to represent a type of the true hope of Sudan for a peaceful future.  <br /> <br />When the Lion Roars is not an easily categorized book. It has suspense, though it's not a suspense novel. It hints at romance, but it's not a romance and it's not a mystery. It is a well-written fictional novel based on what's happening in Sudan. The story gives clarity and a sense of understanding to a complicated part of today's world. That Ms Mills has spent many hours researching is obvious. The basic Sudanese conflict unfolds in an understandable manner without over-simplification of the complexity of the issues surrounding the conflict. She minces no words in her portrayal of the GOS's human rights abuses, and, through her three main characters' point of view, you feel the agony and frustration of the situation in Sudan.  <br /> <br />Her skill as writer comes through in the fast-paced opening pages and well-crafted scene hooks. As a reader, you want to keep going to see how the story ends. Her commitment to her faith is apparent as her characters struggle to find the purpose for their lives and in their work. Yet, these Christian issues do not overpower the plot.  <br /> <br />I've read many books by Ms Mills and found this one to be an incredibly enlightening read. An unexpected adventure! I think you will too, and I highly recommend its purchase. For those of you looking for a book club selection or small group study book, When the Lion Roars even has a Christian-focused discussion guide to use. <br />	2005-05-19

Mack: dad to a college age daughter and widower who mourns his lost companion while recognizing his needs to be a lover/mate/companion again; Cady: who fears becoming her Aunt Vesta and yearns for children before her biological clock stops. Both are engaging characters that you can quickly relate with. Her well-fleshed out secondary characters add depth and poignancy to the storyline.<br />Realities of mature h/h, single parenthood, and complicated family relationships are well portrayed with touches of humorous insight. I think romance purists will miss the usual trademark JAK sensual tension between Cady and Mack, but overall character development is quite strong and the zingy Krentz dialogue moves the story along. <br />Avid mystery fans may figure out \\"who dunnit\\", but I think JAK has done a superb plotting job with many believable villains and interesting twists. The emphasis here isn't on guess-who-dunnit nail-biting suspense, but compelling characters who draw you into their world.<br />It's a good read with a good storyline even if a bit off the usual JAK tracks.	2002-01-05

Jayne Anne Krentz writing as Amanda Quick has moved her distinct contemporary writing style into the realm of the gothic regency with Wicked Widow. <br />The main characters, Artemas Hunt and Madeline Deveridge, are delightful and quickly capture your heart.  Lively dialogue snaps back and forth between the two as each attends to his/her personal agenda while combining efforts to unveil the ghost who is stalking the Wicked Widow, Madeline, and the Vanza Book of Secrets.  All the while, they fight their growing attraction to each other.<br />Her superb, evocative word pictures of the gothic regency era paint the perfect setting in the reader's mind.  True, the references to the Vanzagarian Society are at times overwhelming, but its representation is accurate for the period.  That's what you did in the early 1800's! Such fixations have been replaced by things like Internet surfing, TV, movies, etc. in the 21st century.<br />The engaging personalities of her secondary characters add yet another level of charm to the story.  Short John, the street urchin spy; Latimer, the bodyguard coachman; Aunt Bernice, herbalist extraordinaire; Henry Leggett, Artemas's solicitor and strategist.  Madeline's dead husband, Renwick, whom she is rumored to have murdered. Catherine, Artemas's lover, who was murdered in a prank by rakes of the ton.

I found it an enjoyable read, but totally different than the others in the series.  <BR><br />The plot, based on a mind-altering and libido stimulating drug and missing persons, is fast-paced.  There's even a touch of supernatural with the telepathic link between Mac and his sister Jilly.  All these elements combine to keep you reading.<BR><br />Coulter's descriptions of the different settings are vivid.  You'll find yourself squirming at some of the encounters Mac and Laurie have with the native animal life in the Rain Forest. <BR><br />The 1st person male viewpoint is unique and, as you can tell from the other reviews, troubling for most readers.  Because The Edge is not 3rd person POV, the characters appear to lack depth.  You only get to view what's happening from Mac's viewpoint.  I think that's why most reader found it more difficult to become absorbed.  <BR><br />The Edge seemed to focus on suspense and leave out the hint of romance that you find in the other books of the series.  The usual romance elements and sexual tension between Mac and Laurie weren't obvious.  Even Dillon and Sherlock didn't come across as well in The Edge as they have in the other books.<BR><br />Not what we are used to from Ms Coulter, but the plot and the unique writing style make it an entertaining and interesting read.  Worth the read for Catherine Coulter fans!	2001-09-05

The characters are charming: a sexy Sheriff David Hendrickson, quirky old-agers and townspeople, wacky senior citizen sleuths IdaClare and Delbert, and Hannah Garvey, a 40-something advertising agency dynamo who leaves Chicago's hustle and bustle to manage Valhalla Springs, an exclusive retirement community in the Missouri Ozarks.  Even the pets are memorable, a mutt named Malcolm and a rottweiler named Rambo.  <br />The dialogue's incredible with the vivid mental pictures it evokes.  Some of the scenes will have you laughing out loud. The prose can sometimes require a re-read because its breeziness is confusing, but it's saucy and funny.  <br />The mystery plot's good with a not-too-obvious twist.  The romantic tense great!  The rich blend of humor, romance, mystery, and danger with the author's sense of humor provides the reader with non-stop reading enjoyment.<BR><br />Can't wait to read East of Peculiar, the first of the series, and North of Clever, the sequel, when it comes out.  Suzan Ledbetter has me hooked on this series.  Her style is fast, refreshing, and hilariously funny. Great entertainment!	2001-09-05

The 2001 revision of the 1999 RITA Award book portrays the life of Swedish immigrant Inga Linberg and Dirk Bridger, an Iowa dairy farmer, with the added insight of their spiritual journey with God. <br /> Because of his strong sense of responsibility, Dirk Bridger has abandoned his dreams of world travel and adventure to settle in Uppsala, Iowa, as the guardian of his two orphaned nieces and his deceased brother's dairy farm. Pragmatically, he struggles with despair over his lost dream and the monotonousness of life on the farm. Dirk's sure God if He even exists, has abandoned him. <br /> Inga, the oldest daughter of a Lutheran minister, is resigned to God's plan for her life as quilt artist and capable assistant in her father's ministry. Unlike her four sisters, Inga is neither attractive nor flirtatious and completely content until Dirk arrives at the parsonage to ask her father's help in finding someone to assist him in caring for the two children and his ailing mother. Inga agrees to become his live-in housekeeper and quickly brings order and love to the Bridger household. Personally, she grows discontent with her life. As time goes by, Dirk finds himself attracted to the tall, willowy Swedish immigrant that his mom and nieces have come to love. When Dirk's mother dies, proprietary morals of the period prohibit Inga from continuing in her role as live-in housekeeper. Dirk offers Inga a marriage contract to be terminated when his nieces are older. When Inga agrees, their lives are forever changed. <br /> Robin Hatcher skillfully weaves a tender romance between Inga and Dirk while portraying their spiritual struggles in an unobtrusive, believable way. Her historical and cultural accuracy blends an engaging story line with Swedish heritage in an authentic narrative of life in 19th century America. <br /> Through Inga's correspondence with her friends from the voyage to America sprinkled throughout the story, the reader sees glimpses of the main characters from the other books in the Coming to America series. After reading about Dirk and Inga, I'm sure you'll want to read their stories too!	2001-08-24

Robin Hatcher's THE SHEPHERD'S VOICE is a sober portrayal of Depression era realities with spiritual truths entwined through her well-developed characters. <br />Akira Macauley believes God answered her prayer for hired help on the sheep ranch her grandfather has left her in Ransom, Idaho, when she finds a penniless vagabond collapsed on the road.  With trust in that belief, she hauls him back to the ranch and helps him to regain not only his health, but also his lost faith. The unfolding story of Gabe's tainted past, his life as a convicted murderer, and his struggle to regain his lost faith holds the reader captive.  The plot twists and turns test the faith of both Akira and Gabriel and challenge their growing relationship while presenting, with brutal authenticity, a picture of life during Depression years.   <br />Hatcher builds the romantic relationship between Akira and Gabe Talmadge's through worldly realities to a credible happily-ever-after ending in a way that every romance reader will find endearing.  Some readers may be discomforted by Robin's strong presentation of Akira Macauley's faith or Gabe's struggle to regain a relationship with God, but her genuine warmth and distinctive writing style make that faith a believable, integral part of their story.  Your heart cannot help but be touched by the romance, the spiritual truths, and historical setting.  After reading The Shepherd's Voice, you'll understand why this author has received so many writing awards.	2001-08-20

Riptide, fifth of the FBI series, is good contemporary suspense with an original plot full of vivid characters, unexpected twists, and satisfyingly unpredictable denouements.  The riptide currents of Coulter's plot keep the reader off balance, engrossed, and breathless until the end. <br /> Becca Matlock receives increasingly intimidating phone calls from a menacing stalker who identifies himself as &quot;your boyfriend&quot; and threatens to kill her boss, the governor of New York.  The police don't believe her, even after the stalker kills a homeless woman.  When her mother dies of cancer and the governor is actually shot, Becca flees New York City and her job as a senior speechwriter for the governor.  Disguising her appearance, she escaping to Riptide, a small town in Maine, for sanctuary, but soon finds herself at even greater risk when a skeleton falls from her basement wall during a storm and brings the unwanted attention of the local authorities.  In Riptide, she is reunited with Tyler McBride, her old college friend, and confides in him.   <br />   Then Adam Carruthers, a mysterious, handsome man, appears to be her &quot;guardian angel&quot; protector.  As Becca and Adam work to puzzle out the stalker's motives, secrets about Becca's past, like a father she has long believed dead, are revealed.  When Becca and Adam realize who their enemy is, Dillon, Sherlock, and her husband Savich from Coulter's previous novels join forces with them to help stop the stalker's threats. <br /><br />When Regency novelist Catherine Coulter moved to suspense a few years back, as a loyal fan I followed her.  Riptide lacks deep romantic development between Adam and Becca, but the suspenseful twists made up for it.  An enjoyable recreational read for anyone, Coulter fans or not!	2001-08-13

Faith Donovan, jewelry designer, has created a necklace containing $1 million in rubies which, it turns out have dubious ownership. Her plan is to exhibit the necklace at a jewelry show in Savannah, Georgia, before turning it over to the owners, the Montegeau family, at the wedding of Jeff Montegeau, family son, and Faiths pregnant pal, Mel.  Owen Walker, ruby expert employed by Faiths brother, Archer Donovan, is called upon to guard the necklace when Archer insures the rubies in transit.  Mysterious accidents begin shadowing the designer as bloodthirsty Russian Mafia and local mobster thugs, attempt to steal the jewels.  Walker, recovering from injures suffered in Afghanistan while seeking rubies for the Donovan family, becomes Faiths capable bodyguard.  Local FBI agents add their twists as they follow Walker and Faith. <br />  The plot thickens at Ruby Bayou, ancestral home of the Montegeau family, when Lowell introduces Jeff's father, Davis, a descendant of pirates and owner of a missing Blessing Chest reported to hold a fortune in gems, Davis sister Tiga, and the family hound Boomer.  Montegeaus dark secrets of the past and present begin unfolding and deranged fantasy world of Aunt Tiga offers clues to why the bad guys are after Faith and the secret of the long-lost Blessing Chest.  Even CIA agent April Joy from the other books reappears to add spice to the tale. Through clever banter and the unmistakable sexual tension spiral that Lowell is so well known for, the romantic attraction between Walker and Faith merges into trust and commitment as each overcomes their fear of loving someone again.  Lowell builds one of her best male characters in Owen Walker causing Faith Donovans character, through well defined, to pale in comparison.    The fascinating, informative descriptions of exquisite ruby qualities and lessons on the rubytrade skillfully blend through the story line.<br /> Im a long time Elizabeth Lowell fan and I found Midnight in Ruby Bayou a completely entertaining read that kept me engrossed in both the relationships between the characters and the outcome of the plot.  Reading the other books in the Donovan series probably adds to the enjoyment of this installment because you have all the previous Donovan family character background.  However, for a completely entertaining read, this romantically spiced mystery is quite enjoyable on its own.  If you havent read the other books in the series, you probably will once you finish this one!	2001-08-01

Left Behind, written in the mid-nineties, is the first of the apocalyptic series. <br />In Left Behind we meet Rayford Steele, pilot, and his flight attendant, Hattie Durham.  When Steele puts the plane on autopilot and goes to visit Hattie, he finds some passengers aboard the Boeing 747 are missing.  All that remains are rumpled piles of clothing, pieces of jewelry, fillings, surgical pins, and the like.  In his investigation, he quickly discovers that the disappearances are worldwide. People around the world have mysteriously disappeared and theories about why surface -- terrorists, UFOs, aliens from another planet.  With the Rapture of the Saints, terror and chaos reign.  Steele teams up with Buck Williams, a hot shot young newshound, to investigate exactly what has happened to their loved ones.  Nicolae Carpathia also makes his appearance as he begins his rise to establish a one-world government, soothe the fears, and unite the world.  For those left behind, the apocalypse has just begun.<br />   The book's words give reality and substance to the familiar words and themes of Revelation.  Sharing the authors' premillennial view, I have no problem with the theological presentation of the series as others do.  These books are written for entertainment, not as eschatology treatise.  They are easy to read with suspenseful action and character development that progresses through the series.<br />  Jenkins and LaHaye purposed to write &quot;...the first fictional portrayal of events that are true to the literal interpretation of Bible prophecy.&quot;  I believe they accomplished that goal and provide a truly great wake up call to their readers to examine their own beliefs.	2001-02-01

The Tribulation Force struggles to survive in the center of these new terrors, the death of more loved ones and some unexpected twists in plans.  Can they hang on through The Great Tribulation? <br />The Mark: The Beast Rules the World is the eighth installment of the Left Behind series.  Jenkins portrayal of Biblical prophecy about the mark of the Beast and all its reality is scary and factual to the theological presentation began in book one.  Read as fiction, it is an action-packed thriller filled with apocalyptic mayhem, quirky humor, and addicting plot twists.  Read as a prophetic interpretation of the end times of Biblical prophecy, it causes self-reflection about personal beliefs.  The mysterious addicting power of the story continues to outweigh the quality of its writing and marketing thrust.   The books are compellingly hard to put down.  Because of theircliff hanger endings, I find myself anxious to read the next episode to see how the Tribulation Force fares even though I know how the story will end!	2001-02-01
