I was hoping for some good scholarship, some historical content, some hard-hitting logic (which I know James White is capable of).<br />What a disappointment.<br />I would say that 70% of this book is nothing more than extended quotes from Catholic writers.  In fact, towards the end, White simply quotes pages and pages and pages and pages of St. Alphonsus Liguori's Marian writings (mostly *The Glories of Mary*) - talk about good filler!  I wish I could simply copy and paste somebody's else's book into my own book, make a few disparaging remarks about it, and then get paid for it!<br />He does the same thing in later chapters with a few of Pope John Paul II's encyclicals.  Long, long quotations, with very little refutation, aside from a few snide comments.<br />White could have done a lot better than this.  I've come to expect honest work from him, but this is absolutely horrid.  Why does he never mention or quote from the Fathers who did believe in Mary's sinlessness?  Why does he not interact with the many Fathers who believed in her perpetual virginity?  He doesn't, but he does interact with modern apologists' arguments, and then quotes the Fathers when they seem to support him.<br />Tsk, tsk.<br />Get this book used, if you have to get it.	2001-11-21

Hahn is able to show us how Mary was prophesied in these events, albeit in a very subtle, very puzzle-like way.<br />Go with Dr. Hahn on this detective's adventure through Scripture, and see what has been right in front of your eyes the whole time (much like when you finally see the image hidden in a MagicEye 3D picture).<br />This book is fun, light, interesting, and very informative.  You won't be disappointed.	2001-11-14

He argues convincingly, and provides copious source notes.  You can't go wrong.  By the way, before I get into the review \\"proper,\\" I would recommend that you also purchase Mr. Ray's *Upon This Rock*, a phenomenal defense of the Papacy.<br />This book, *Crossing the Tiber*, is really two books in one.  It is divided into a conversion story (which is one really long chapter, consisting of somewhere around 100 pages), and a defense of two doctrines: the Eucharist and Baptism.  As is his custom, Mr. Ray builds his defenses by citing all relevant Scripture, along with plenty of foot-note commentary, and then citing all relevant Patristic sources, again, with much foot-note commentary.<br />This book packs a powerful one-two punch in this way, and is highly recommended for anyone who needs a good reason to join the Catholic Church.  Mr. Ray's conversion story plows the field, by raising in the reader's mind all the questions that were raised in Mr. Ray's mind during the course of his journey.  His defense of the Eucharist and Baptism at the end of the book plant the seeds in this newly plowed field, by giving plenteous arguments from Scripture, supplemented with evidence of how the entire Church had always understood these Scriptures from the beginning.<br />If you're not a theologian, that's ok.  This work isn't overly heavy on technicality, just on solid reasoning.  It's easily followed by anyone, and you may just find yourself becoming a theologian by the end of the book.	2001-11-14

Why are You Waiting?	Absolutely phenomenal work.  Patrick Madrid gently takes you by the hand and shares his experience and wisdom in sharing the Gospel.  Addressing the unique scenarios of people who 1) have never been in any church, 2) are in a Protestant Church and are hostile to the Catholic Church, and 3) used to be in the Church, but are now \\"ex-catholics\\" who fall into either category (1) or (2) above, Madrid equips you to handle almost any situation, to be able to interact with almost any person.<br />In each chapter, Madrid looks in depth at each unique situation, shares his experiences, practical wisdom, suggested reading, and a few spiritual exercises to boot.  Each chapter ends with a time of reflection for you, a time of prayer (with specific printed prayers at the end of each chapter), and a list of \\"next steps,\\" which cover such things as \\"pray the rosary once a day for a month for the person you're witnessing to,\\" or \\"spend one hour in front of the Blessed Sacrament, praying for your potential convert.\\"  He also provides examples from saints, such as St. Francis DeSales, who were successful in the work of evangelization.<br />Madrid places the focus where it should be: not on impressing your potential convert with head-knowledge, but on personal holiness that will allow you to exhibit a loving, caring attitude towards this individual, so that your very life, not just your words, will be an invitation to join the Church.<br />However, Madrid does not forget the intellectual side of the preperation, and he gives a very helpful step-program, with a list of books at the end of his book that you should read for further study.  He breaks this up into several phases, reading lighter material in the early phases, moving into heavier theology in the later phases.<br />All in all, a very practical, very helpful book.  All it needs is a support group for people using Madrid's methods... (...)	2001-11-14

A great little book that can be read in short sittings, one delightful story at a time.  If you have friends or family outside the Church, this book is a great tool - why reinvent the wheel, right?  Let those who have been there tell their stories and provide all the reasons for becoming a Catholic!<br />The stories range from the lay-person to the minister, from the wildly heathen to the devout Christian, from New Age hippies who found their way into the Church to pious Reformers who found their way into this same Church.<br />This makes the book invaluable as a witnessing tool.  Anyone who takes the time to read through all the stories will, at some point, find themselves saying, &quot;This sounds a lot like me,&quot; and, &quot;I've been there - I can relate.&quot;<br />This book will warm your heart as you rejoice with the converts, and it will prove a great invitation to those outside the Church.

Who needs 'em! (you do)	The Catholic Church presents and preserves a beautiful teaching about our brothers and sisters in Christ who have gone on before us in a state of grace... that we are not separated by death, that our departed loved ones can still hear us and pray for us, and that there is a real union between us.<br />Pat Madrid presents a very brief, yet very substantive book that examines this teaching.  Covering topics that range from praying to the saints to the power of saintly relics, Madrid argues almost exclusively from the Scripture, thus making this book a valuable resource in presenting the Communion of the Saints to a bible-only Christian.<br />As you read this book, you will hear the objections against this teaching from both modern apologists as well as the founding fathers of the Reformation (i.e., Calvin and Luther).  You will be directed to the Scriptures that support this teaching, and be invited to consider the implications of those Scriptures.  You will be taken back into history to see how these teachings (prayers to saints and venerating relics) were actually practiced BEFORE the Church came into being, by the Jews who comprised the first Church.<br />For being such a short, digestible work, this book is dense with truth, and is recommended for daily meditation.	2001-11-14

I'll let the author do his own apologetics and just tell you what you can expect to find in this book.<br />First, it's short (7 chapters?).  Digestible is good, and you'll be able to consume this in several small sessions, or in one good 4-hour session, if you so desire.<br />The author describes how he set out to refute the Jesus Seminar (much of which tries to discredit the veracity of the Gospels, the historicity of the Jesus in the Gospels, and which books really belong in the bible), and soon discovered just how much he had to rely on the Tradition of the Catholic Church.<br />He examines the historical councils of the Church that defined which books belong in the bible.  He examines the historical witness of the Church to such things as the veracity, the inerrancy of Scripture.<br />He examines the historical development of such moral teachings as abortion, homosexuality, and polygamy, and shows just how much we all (Protestants and Catholics alike) have relied on the authority of the Catholic Tradition in understanding these matters.<br />For example, he shows how 99.9% of Christians accept that polygamy is wrong, but he asks why that is.  He shows several Scripture passages to demonstrate how a case could be built, using Scripture alone and separate from a Catholic Tradition, for the moral rightness of polygamy.<br />All in all, it's a very thoughtful book, and very easy to follow.  Whether you think he's right or not is for you to decide... best wishes in that endeavor.	2001-11-14

Not only is Shea bright and funny, but the tools with which he equips you in this book (almost without you even knowing it) will stay with you forever, and drastically change the way you read the bible.<br />Borrowing from the wisdom of the early Church Fathers, Shea shows us how to read the bible with a new pair of eyes, eyes that will penetrate deeper and deeper into these all-too-familiar texts.<br />As a newcomer to Catholicism, I've been absolutely reveling in this revolutionary (if something 2,000 years old can be called such) way of reading Scripture.  I've begun to host bible studies using this method, and the attendents are loving it!  I had one girl say, &quot;I've never read the bible like this - this changes everything.&quot;<br />Let Shea introduce you to the early Christians, and let him show you how to read and learn the bible.	2001-11-14

It IS the kind of thing you want to keep handy at all times, or better yet, memorize it.  It IS the sort of supplement that is nice to have when you KNOW the words of the bible, but you don't remember the chapter and verse.  It IS the kind of thing that's nice when you KNOW the logic behind a teaching, but you need a list of bible verses that support it.  It IS a kind of cross-reference guide that will help you become familiar with all the places in the bible that support Catholic teaching, so that you don't have to rely on one lonely proof-text.<br />This really is more like a Yellow Pages, with a handy tab-style reference on the sides of the pages, for fast, easy reference.

In fact, most of the people I know are not necessarily watering at the mouth for apologetics text books, and the few that are would prefer Scott Hahn or Pat Madrid to Sungenis.  Why?  Hahn and Madrid speak more down-to-earth, presupposing no knowledge on the part of the reader.  Sungenis writes more for the scholar, presupposing some knowledge of the Greek language (i.e., he spells Greek words using the Greek alphabet, without providing English transliterations, as Hahn or Madrid might do).<br />If you're still with me, if you're still interested, if you still want to roll up your sleeves and deepen your faith, then hear me telling you to get this book.  In fact, get the whole trilogy (Not by Bread Alone, Not by Scripture Alone, and Not By Faith Alone).  This book goes through the Old Testament, then the New Testament, then to history itself.  Sungenis examines Eucharistic passages with a microscope, highlighting cross references, original language, interpretations offered by the opposition, and refutations of the opposition for each passage.  He ends by looking to the Early Church to see how they interpreted the doctrine of the Eucharist.<br />If you're a Catholic, you need this book to strengthen your own faith, make you appreciate the mass more, and give you some good defense for your beliefs.  If you're not Catholic, then you should at least consider what Sungenis offers (if you're open-minded that is - if you're just out to refute anything a Catholic has to say, there are several other books you can attack that are much cheaper than this one), and see if what he says is true.<br />It's a technical, scholarly work, but if you're serious about worshiping God with your heart AND your mind, then you need to get this book and start getting dirty.	2001-11-12

It may or may not really be worth 4 stars.  I freely admit it.  You see, this is the first book that I picked up off the shelf in a local, hole-in-the-wall Catholic Bookstore.  It was sheer curiosity.  I wanted to know how a Fundamentalist could ever be persuaded to &quot;swim the Tiber,&quot; and join a religion that is the total antithesis to Fundamentalism.  At the time, I was having a few questions of my own about the strengths of my own foundations (having been raised a Calvinist).  I read this book, and it blew me away.<br />Now, Currie is no word-wizard.  He does not come across in this book as being a brilliant theologian.  What he does is simply share his story, his questions, and the answers that he found, in all simplicity and honesty.  He's very real, and very approachable in this work, and the reason it blew me over was simply the fact that I found myself repeating, &quot;He went through exactly what I'm going through.&quot;  It was comforting to know that I wasn't the first to ask the questions, leave the church of my youth, and feel led towards Rome.<br />Currie answered many of my questions, and even raised a few that I hadn't even considered.  He explored the logical conclusions to many Fundamentalist doctrines, such as, &quot;if sola scriptura says that all doctrines must be proved from Scripture in order to be binding, then sola scriptura itself must be proved from Scripture.&quot;  Some of you reading this may being thinking, &quot;duh,&quot; but at the time, so very early in my journey, that thought had never even crossed my mind.  I, like Currie writes about himself, had been accepting sola scriptura as an unproven assumption, without ever thinking to question it.<br />Examples like these abound throughout the book.  I highly recommend it, but of course, since it was the first book in a long series of books that led me &quot;Home to Rome,&quot; it holds a special place of fondness to me - so don't take mybiased opinion on the matter.

No heresy is original, and after reading this book, you'll see what I mean.  Was Luther original?  Not really.

And for those who haven't been exposed to Hahn before, this study will probably blow your mind and make you, as Hahn coined it, a \\"Scripture junkie.\\"<br />The only reason I say this one might be a lemon is that this is the 4th Hahn bible study I've been exposed to.  I did Matthew, Revelation, and Galatians before this one, and frankly, I was disappointed with this one.<br />Why?  <br />Hahn's remarks are great, where he makes them.  My complaint is that he didn't make enough of them.  This is a 16-tape set, but what you don't know is that the tapes are only 45 minutes long - so about 20 minutes per side.  In other words, Hahn doesn't have enough time to really delve into the texts with any detail.  In fact, he begins the first tape by saying, \\"Let's do a quick review, get a bird's eye view before we dig in and get a worm's eye view.\\"<br />So we begin to \\"review\\" from a \\"bird's eye,\\" the whole while, my mouth is watering for the \\"worm's eye view,\\" and I can't wait to get to that part... and then I realize, this tape series only covers his \\"bird's eye view.\\"  Whatever \\"worm's eye\\" view he led his class through didn't make it onto these tapes, and that was a bit disappointing.<br />So, that being said... Hahn does a great job, and 16 45-minute tapes is better than no tapes, but just be forewarned...	2001-11-10

I hope he reads this review someday, just so he can finally hear my appreciation.  This book is so desperately needed...<br />If you've done any reading of authors like Boettner (*Roman Catholicism*), or more recently, Dave Hunt (*A Woman Rides the Beast*), or if you've interacted with &quot;well-read&quot; Protestants who know a little Catholic History, then you may have heard most of the myths in this book...<br />Did you know Pope Honorius taught heresy and was officially condemned by a council for his teaching?<br />Did you know Pope Pius was on Hitler's side during the war?<br />Did you know Peter was never even in Rome?<br />These arguments and 27 more are examined, and then addressed by Madrid.  Why is this book so invaluable?  Because some of us can defend the Catholic Church on issues of theology.  Some of us know the bible and the Church Fathers well enough to spot bad theology or bad philosophy.  But not many of us know our Church history too well.  And you can sit and argue the meaning of &quot;You are Peter, and on this Rock I will build my Church&quot; all day long, but when your opponent pulls some devastating historical fact out of his hat, you're in trouble.<br />&quot;Don't tell me the Pope is infallible, Pope Liberius signed a document promulgating the Arian heresy, a heresy that was later condemned by the Council of Nicea!&quot;<br />He may even throw a few dates in there.  Now you're really in trouble.  Why?  Because this isn't in the bible.  It's not in the theological treatises of the Fathers.  It's in Church History, and if you're not a historian, it can be hard to even know where to start looking for answers.<br />Madrid has done all the homework for you.  He answers the myths (and yes, they are myths), gives places and names and dates, and provides historical documents in his citations so you can do some brush-up reading later.  <br />Don't be stumped by someone who once heard a rumor, attached a few ancient dates, places, and names, and then called it &quot;history.&quot;  Get this book, and help put an end to the myths.<br />I use this book as a reference all the time... I hear the myth about Pope Honorius, and I think, &quot;I've heard that name before... let's see... yep!

Drawing from plenty of outside sources, such as the Church Fathers and *Legends of Jerusalem*, you don't have to worry that you're getting only one man's opinion on this very complicated book.<br />This book of the bible is so full of weird signs and events, that it's no wonder there are hundreds of differing interpretations.  It's no wonder LaHaye and Jenkins can make millions on a series like *Left Behind*.  It's no wonder people are still scanning the headlines (especially after 9/11/01) to see if they can tell who The Beast is, when the 666 is coming, if the AntiChrist has finally arrived.<br />Scott Hahn brings the book back into it's original context: 1st century Jerusalem.  Suddenly, the book isn't quite so hard to interpret, because we're looking back and interpreting, in a sense, based on &quot;old newspaper headlines,&quot; not looking to future newspaper headlines.  This gives us an incredible benefit!<br />Hahn reveals his own personal view about the binding of Satan as well - a view I've never heard anywhere else.

I love his style.  The way he strings his words together, the vocabulary he uses, and the reflective style would lead one to believe that he might very well be British, and that he might very well have been sitting in a big comfy chair with a cup of tea while he wrote this, and that he might even be C.S. Lewis, reincarnated.<br />If you're not a Catholic, this book will give a quick glimpse into the &quot;family living room,&quot; and show you what Catholicism is all about from a practical view.  If you are a Catholic, this book will remind you what it's all about, or, will give you a vision of what it all SHOULD be about in your own life if it's not already.<br />Yes, it's light on theology, in a sense.  He DOES address the Mass, the Eucharist, Mary, etc., but not by saying, &quot;Ok, well, let's look at this Greek verb here, conjugate the infinitive participial imperative tense...&quot;  Instead, he looks at these issues in light of the Incarnation, and shows how the Catholic Church only follows the logic of the Incarnation perfectly.  He doesn't come at you saying, &quot;Look, I'm going to prove something to you here,&quot; and so you're not on the defensive.  When he explains it, you just sort of say, &quot;Oh... duh, that makes total sense.  How could it be any other way?&quot;<br />Very comfortable book, like a good pair of slippers.

Too many books against the Catholic Church go over-the-top and attack straw men, without ever really touching what the Church truly teaches.  In White's introduction to this book, it seemed he would be taking a different approach.<br />He didn't.<br />He does present the Roman arguments, sometimes citing official documents of the Church, but when it comes to answering the really tough questions (sola scriptura, sola fide, the Real Presence), he doesn't seem to address Rome so much.<br />He quotes from Catholic authors (Ludwig Ott and others), and attacks their arguments, but that won't suffice.  Perhaps he does too much attacking and not enough defending of his own doctrines... perhaps.<br />For example... he cites the Roman claim that divisions in the Protestant camp prove that they cannot be the true, united Church, but then attacks that claim by saying that Rome is just as divided... interesting hypothesis, but he provides no evidence to prove it.<br />He calls Catholics &quot;circular&quot; in their arguments of Scripture pointing to an infallible Church, since it is only the Church that can interpret the Scripture - but he fails to address the circular reasoning in the Protestant claim that the Scripture is infallible because the Scripture says so.<br />He addresses the issue of oral tradition presented in Jesus' teaching on the &quot;Seat of Moses&quot; (Mt. 23:1-3), and refutes the claim by pointing out that Jesus attacks the Pharisees who sit in Moses' Seat.  No mention of where this teaching of a Seat of Moses came from (there's no record of it in the Bible), and no treatment of Jesus' words that &quot;you must obey them,&quot; precisely because they DO sit on Moses' Seat.<br />These are just a few of the examples from this book that really left me still asking questions... this book feels like it was too rushed in its writing.<br />2 stars, because at least he quotes some official Church docs.	2001-07-05

To floppy?  To CD-ROM?  You decide...), and stresses data services  as well (knowing which cursor types and locations to use).<br />Read this book  for a good overall picture, but also read the following:<br />- VB6 Desktop  Exam Prep<br />- VB6 Black Book<br />- VB6 Distributed Exam Cram (this will give  you some cross-reference on data services and package/deployment)<br />Good  luck on the test.	2000-02-24

Books on C++, the Internet, etc... <br />It's certainly a Dave-Barry-meets-Joe-Programmer kind of book, and I have to admit, even though it's hard to take this stuff seriously (ever other sentence is a play on words or programming concepts), the  metaphors still explained some things very clearly.<br />I'll never forget  Inky, popping plates off a stack of plates in response to stack push and  pop commands.  <br />If you're willing to take yourself less seriously and  embrace the fact that programmers are really geeks, then you will laugh at  this book.  <br />From Mr. Bunny's first appearance in chapter 1 (his first  words are, of course, &quot;Hello World!&quot;) to the last chapter's Home  Sweet Home Page, this book is worth reading - if you can stand to laugh  that hard.	2000-02-24

Granted, the level of my enjoyment may have directly linked to the fact that I've been studying for the MCSD for the last two months, and after having read enough  &quot;tech books&quot; to cross my eyes, this was a more-than-welcome  relief.  Maybe I laughed extra hard because my nerves are frayed.  Still...  slightly irreverent treatment of programming and ActiveX, but very funny,  especially if you have a good understanding of Microsoft technologies.   Even if you don't, you should still get most of the jokes (such as the  chapter index beginning at 0 instead of 1).  Take a break, put down that  COM manual, and read this book.	2000-02-14
US	50226888	R3K870UW53AS49	186100172X	992820018	Beginning Visual Basic 6 Objects	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Interesting	Right from the start, I'll say that my review of this book will be a bit skewed.  I already had a good grasp of OO programming before I bought this book, so the first several chapters were a breeze.  From what I can tell,  it looks very nicely presented and extremely lucid.  I actually picked up  the book to skim through the sections on UML, and those sections were  pretty good too.  So, over all, I'd say this was a good book, but do  remember, it's a beginner's book, and I wasn't reading it as a beginner.   I'll exit stage left now, and leave you with a grain of salt...	2000-02-14
US	50226888	R2XGAZOAEE1YVC	0735608334	600275837	Distributed Applications with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit (Dv-McSd Training Kit)	Books	3	10	10	N	N	Huggable, Loveable, Predictable Microsoft	There is some great stuff in this book.  Good coverage of MTS, COM/DCOM, ADO... typical &quot;bullet-point&quot; style makes it good for highlighting and converting into flash-card material.  There was very  little on ASP and ActiveX Documents (little coverage in the appendix at the  back), and the end-of-chapter reviews won't map very closely to the exam.   The material will be somewhat helpful in preparing you for general concepts  on the exam, but if you're looking for exam-style questions and specifics,  use the exam cram series.	2000-02-10
US	50226888	R12AWKV8WY5UCA	0735608547	276424922	Analyzing Requirements and Defining Solution Architectures MCSD Training (MCSD Training Guide)	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Good Reading, Bad Test Prep	This book is different in that it matches each chapter of new information with a story-book-style chapter in which characters talk about and use the concepts explained in previous chapters.  This &quot;Case Study&quot; is  most helpful in cementing these abstract principles that tend to get  convoluted in Microsoft's &quot;bullet-point&quot; style of teaching.   However... supplement this book with an exam cram book for the test.  This  book is a good overview, but not adequate exam prep.	2000-02-10
US	50226888	R1QR56CIRG7VJ8	0072119322	616875006	MCSD Visual Basic 6 Distributed Applications Study Guide (Exam 70-175)	Books	1	5	6	N	N	Run Away, and Don't Look Back	If you want to get bogged down with information that will never show up on the exam, then this pretentiously thick book (aren't exam preps supposed to be condensed? ) is for you.  Example? There are a lot of ADO questions on  the exam, but this book spends most of its data discussion dealing with  legacy systems, VSAM, ISAM, DB2... and they have the gall to quiz you on  this material in the end-of-chapter exams.  Distracting, error-prone, and  too much paper.  Just don't.	2000-02-10
US	50226888	R1ZQB7PNLAP1FW	0735609675	615762972	Web Applications with Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 MCSD Training Kit (Dv-Dlt Fundamentals)	Books	2	27	28	N	N	Expected Delivery	This book will do the trick for a good overview of Interdev and distributed applications.  It touches on MTS, SQL, DHTML, and ASP.  However, as with all the other MOC Training Kits, don't rely on this book to give you exam success.  For a more thorough look at VID, check out the  Microsoft &quot;Mastering...&quot; series.  If you're expecting to pass the  exam with this book, then I give it two stars.  If you're just looking for  an overview of distributed programming/Internet applications, I give it  three stars.	2000-02-04
US	50226888	R2F9GEK7NDDMQM	1576102602	188660363	MCSD Visual Basic 6 Desktop Exam Prep (Exam: 70-176)	Books	4	7	9	N	N	4 Stars and Counting...	I'm up to the 6th of 17 chapters, and I'm already very impressed.  This book will, if nothing else, give you a solid grounding in VB fundementals.  Very meaty code examples that are easy to understand, and each chapter  walks you through a new programming project that will build on skills and  tools you used in the previous chapters.  The only reason I didn't give it  5 stars is because I'm not finished reading it yet... give it a try.	2000-01-21

After reading the Exam Cram for the Distributed Exam, I was amazed at the accuracy of Exam Cram material.  But this Desktop book is a waste, and beyond that, it will hurt you in the long run.  Too  many errors.  Errors in the practice exam at the end.  Discrepancies  between what the practice exam says, and what the author says in  corresponding chapters.  Beyond that, it's hard to follow.  Try the Exam  Prep instead...	2000-01-21

After having read 3 or 4 other &quot;exam prep&quot; books (including the MOC, which was about worthless), this one proved to be  golden.  I can confirm the statements made on this page that you *will*  find questions in this book's practice exam that will also be on the test.   After reading other books whose sample exams asked questions that had  nothing to do with the real exam, it's nice to have found a book I can  trust.  I passed the exam using this book, and so can you!	2000-01-19
