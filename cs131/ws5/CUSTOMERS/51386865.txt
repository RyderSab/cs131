The language can get difficult and the concepts complex.<br /><br />  The second section is bang on.  It goes into detail on how a child learns, how it grows, what stimulates the baby.  He also speaks about how children are damaged by modern day childbirthing procedures.  I was immpressed with what he had to say.  And found it meshed nicely with what I know of Early Childhood.  I will be reading up more on this subject.<br /><br /> Besides the obtuse language, the only other down side to this book, were the authors claims for telepathy, mind bending etc.  I didn't buy it, and was forced to skip those chapters.  If you steer clear of the telepathy babble, I would recommend this book.<br /><br />Munawar	2005-01-20

If you want to read a refreshing point of view, or if you know of someone who could use the mental shakeup, then this booklet will be worthwhile.<br /><br />  Two of the selections in this set are abbreviated versions of much larger books (and hence are available elsewhere).<br /><br />  I didn't gain much from this set, but I'd already read the much larger book by John Taylor Gatto, which made up section 2 in this booklet.	2004-07-07

What they did, how they did it, what made them incredible.  I was expecting too much information.<br />  Unfortunatly, what I got instead was a quick overview of everyone.  That was a big turn off, and I almost put the book away right there.<br />  On closer inspection, the 50 alltime greats turned out to be (mostly) Americans & Frenchmen.  Included in the list were some Nazi's, one or two vikings, japanese and asians.  That left a sour taste in my mouth; I highly doubt over 5 gunslingers from Texas should be in the top 50 warriors list of all time.<br />  So that was that, and I wanted to chuck the book, but I couldn't put it down :)  The sheer awesomeness of these men made me keep reading.  5 page biographies or not, I was immpressed and astonished with what some of these men did in the name of honor, courage and self respect.  Just to learn of these men, is reason enough to pick up this book.<br />  Overall, this book kills a couple of hours.  I'd recommend it when you're feeling low, or you need to kill an airplane trip.  Not for everyone.	2003-12-22

What I got instead, was a book explaining the \\"art\\" of eating.  What the different food types are, how to eat them, why to chew, what causes immune system problems, parasites etc.  Stuff your parents should have taught you, but didn't.  (or maybe they did, but you ignored their wisdom).<br />  I think everybody over 200 pounds needs to read this book.

But, the truth is that Ted could have made this book much much better, simply by organizing it better.  First things first, while it possibly looked interesting to the editors, I found it disjointing how the book was a little bit book, then a little bit comic then a little bit book again.<br /><br />  Creative? yes, Functional? No.  I'd stick the whole editorial \\"book\\" as a second chapter or as an Appendix.  They're interesting on their own, but not when I'm in the middle of a quick moving comic.  Besides which, the \\"book\\" part went over the same events in the comic.<br /><br />  Also, I had to kick myself when I found that 20 pages into the comic, the comic finishes.  Oh man, I needed at least 60 pages to get some satisfaction...what are you going to do, the dude came home.<br /><br />  Lastly, some of his \\"facts\\" weren't facts, or I'm an idiot reading all the wrong sources.  I dont think Ted does it on purpose, but he does state stuff that I haven't found true....ie. \\"French reporter gang raped by the Taliban\\"<br /><br />  All in all, I enjoyed it, definatly worth the time he put into it.	2003-10-23

You don't expect professional adventurers to write well, but they do; And they keep you in it.

Flipping through the book I was suprised to find myself completely hooked.<br />  I've been an avid suburban gardener for a while, but this book opened my eyes to what natural gardening is all about.  After this book, I'm dedicated to learning more on real gardening.<br />  Besides the arcane (Read Organic) Gardening knowledge, I loved the California-Granola message.  Peace, love, and Mother Earth baby.  Not to mention strong Conservative Christian overtones...but I like that.<br />  I recommend this book to anyone who owns a rectangle of dirt with greenery growing out of it.  It will change the way you think about plants, and life.  Some of the concepts are a little out of date, but still lots of fun.	2003-10-02

The Christian religion primer is top notch, and got me interested enough to search for other books on the topic.<br />  Yahiya Emerick liberally powders the book with references on who to talk to, which organizations are active in which areas, and how to get in touch with them.  The bibliography (Categorized) is excellent, as it lists books that a person can read if they want more in depth knowledge on a specific subject (ie. Dawah for Asian-Americans).  The list of other Dawah books was very helpful also.<br />  Some negative aspects of the book was the superficial \\"Caucasian\\" Muslims chapter.  As well as the geneology of an immigrant family.  Both seemed rather superficial.<br />  I wouldn't let that get you down though.  This book is a very useful Dawah tool.  It is a great stepping stone into more serious study of Dawah and its specifics.	2003-09-11

As for the book itself, it is a softcover, but the paper is excellent.<br /> \\"Heirs of the prophets\\" covers the reasons to seek knowledge, and the value of the students of knowledge.

He placed a quick commentary and some words of wisdom together with each photograph, and created this book.<br /> Some of the pictures are breathtaking, and some are not so breathtaking. Some of the pictures become breathtaking after reading the commentary; Several pictures made me scratch my head in puzzlement. But after reading Mr. Sander's explanation, I found a new appreciation for the pictures.<br /> I think the book can pass off as an interesting coffee table book. Some people though, will find the photo's and the commentary exceptionaly interesting, and find the book much more then an idle conversation passer.<br /> Anybody interested in exceptional photography (In my limited appreciation of photography) from North Africa and the Middle East will find this book worth the cost.<br /> Peter Sanders is an acquantance of Shaikh Hamza Yusuf; for some people, that might be enough reference to purchase the book.	2002-10-15

Many parts of the book amazed me and left me in awe of the author. A truly mind expanding experience.<br />  Imam Ghazali takes the Light Verse from Surah Nur of the Quran and writes a book on it:<br /> \\"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The Parable of His Light is as if there were a Niche and within it a Lamp: the Lamp enclosed in Glass: the glass as it were a brilliant star: Lit from a blessed Tree, an Olive, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil is well-nigh luminous, though fire scarce touched it: Light upon Light!\\" - Quran 24:35<br /> He first explains what the verse means, and explains man's relation to his creator. Then before he finishes the book, he delves into the inner machinations of the cosmos and how it all services Allah.<br /> This book will blow your socks off. But be warned, this is a philosophical book, that reaches some very deep levels. Anybody ready for deep philosophy and willing to examine man's relation to God, will find this book very illuminating.<br /><br />  Lastly, I believe that the translator/commentator tried to write a useful commentary, but he came at the whole book/concept from a non-Muslim viewpoint. The viewpoint is alien to the Muslim mindset, and could be considered unIslamic.<br /> Some people might find the commentary useful, I found it unuseful.<br /> There is a more expensive version with better type-print etc by David Buchman (Translator).	2002-10-06

The whole concept and ideas behind this book are awesome.  Somewhere in all the trials of age, shootouts, and long descriptions of the wastelands, something in this book touched my heart.  I've read this book at least 10 times and I love it every time.  It's obvious that King put a little of himself in the story, that he's never come close to replicating, even in his attempt with Wizard of the Glass.<br />  For the people who say they found the whole story boring...well this book isn't written for you.

Well, yeah, actually I was.  This was a really good book, Imam Ghazali comes at the whole issue from points of view I didn't quite have in mind when I picked the book up.<br /> Adab un-Nikah explains many aspects of marriage that never made sense to me. The book goes over the advantages of marriage, the disadvantages, the problem with woman (And he gets picky) and then finally Imam Ghazali's conclusion. He hits on many arcane ideas and concepts that were new to me.  A lot of chapters covered things I'd never related to marriage.<br /> The book is written specifically for men, but woman will find this book useful also (If only to glean the wisom in Imam Ghazali's written word). My only difficulty in the book was that it was written from a very high-level sufi perspective. Many of examples used in the book do not exist anymore, or are very uncommon. (ie. topics covering single men who have devoted their entire lives to Dhikr)<br /> The prose is easy...the layman can easily understand the text. At some parts, I wonder at how accurate the translation was; but alas, this is the only English version available.<br /> I recommend this book for all married muslims, esspecially the men. Unmarried men/woman might be confused at some aspects of the book, but it's still good to read. As for non-muslims...You'll need a strong Islamic Knowledge base before you try tackling this one...	2002-09-20

There are 132 small chapters that cover most area's where you will make a dua.  Chapters are named like: \\"Supplication when you wake up\\", \\"Invocation of grief\\", \\"What to say against envy\\", and the list goes on.  Generally I don't have a reference book on dua's, so this book is it.<br />  Each dua is indexed and has the full arabic written out with punctuation.  And if your arabic really [stinks] (like mine) then right below the arabic,  is the dua again in roman arabic (the arabic sounded out in english).  Below that, finally, we have the english translation.<br />  The book was written as a handbook, so having said that, the author (Arab) didn't qualify the dua's.  Each dua has a footnote indicating origin, but the reader doesn't know what type of hadith it is, which of the madhab's use this dua, if there are other variations, history...etc, etc, etc.  For the above info, you need to read the original, unabridged text \\"Adh-Dhikr wad-Duawal Ilah bir Ruqyah minal-Kitab was-Sunnah\\" by the same author.  I like the quick format and just pick out the dua's I need.<br />  This book is about 2 inches by 3 inches large.  Fits in your pocket, and is useful when travelling (ie. Hajj, Umrah).<br />  Unless you have a reference book on Dua's, this is the book to get.  You can't beat the price, and you gotta love that title.  Recommended.	2002-08-10

US	51386865	R19Z36B5Q7OMK0	0394494970	915063041	Alexander Dolgun's story: An American in the Gulag	Books	4	13	15	N	N	Insight into the Soviet Communist System	The book hits you like a slap to the face.  Right from page 1.  Some of the ordeals Alexander Dolgun goes through are mind boggling.<br />  Beyond the story of a man who endures everything, I also enjoyed the narrative on the internal problems of the Soviet communist system.  Whereas most of my knowledge of the USSR is based on the American Media, this book put a face and a heart around cold war russians.<br />  The book began to drag near then end, but overall an amazing book.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Survival, simple torture, and Cold-War Russia.	2002-05-31

How to wield it, how to get it, how to manipulate people, and all the rest.<br />  The book is written at a high level, almost a book of wise facts.  I'm sure there are better books with specific knowledge on power;  But as a general primer on the subject, this book does a good job.<br />  I agree with the other reader that this book is not a direct translation of the original material...but I'm not an academic or a purist in that sense.  I didn't care that there was a lot of Mr Cleary's own wording in places.<br />  Lastly, its obvious that you really need a good scholar on the subject to teach this book to you.  There are too many areas where I could tell there was a mountain buried under 1 sentance.  But don't let that stop you from reading this book.  I would recommend this book as a good starting place on the whole subject of power/management/diplomacy.	2002-05-10
US	51386865	RZW2KDFXSRJLH	0787119164	630610345	Remote Control	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A little like Dick Marcinko	I liked this book.  Very similar to Richard Marcinko's Navy SEAL books.  While Richard Marcinko goes into the technicals of warfare, Andy writes a story that is about human side of being  SAS...and along the way we get to watch some good fight sequences.<br /> The story was good, and it didn't seem like Andy was trying to stuff it full of sensational violence or shoot outs. All round very interesting and entertaining. I look forward to reading some of Andy's other work.<br /> I was especially impressed with the orator/story teller (tape version.) He did a great job of putting all the voices together.	2002-03-19

US Officer Lester Grau interviews many Afghan Mujahideen who fought the Soviet Aggressors during the early 80's.  Out of those interviews Grau wrote three books, This one being the second (with Ahmed Jalali.)<br />  The book is broken into chapters like Raids, Ambushes, Defense etc... Each chapter has many individual \\"stories\\" or debriefings of the mission/situation.  The Muj go into detail on what happened, who got shot and who didn't.  As you progress through the 200 odd missions, you start reading a definite character to the overall war...<br />  All in all, as a non-military person, I found the book fascinating, entertaining, and above all educational.  The diagrams for each mission are very helpful allowing the reader to visualize what happens in each battle.<br />  Overall, If you are interested in Guerilla or Afghan warfare tactics, I would recommend this book.	2002-03-01

US	51386865	R11N2NX67X4CY3	1842122436	757491938	The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe	Books	3	8	14	N	N	Excellent book that completely dies near the end	This book start off with a bang with Genghis(Chingis) Khan's destruction of Present day Iran.  He provides excellent background on who everyone is, what happens, and how it all works out.<br />  Unfortunatly, as the book progresses, the book speeds up and Mr. Chambers starts skipping over important historical information.  I admit, how do you squish 30 years worth of data into a chapter? But by the end, I was still lost over who was fighting who.<br />  Overall, I was extremely entertained, and learned much about the Mongols.  I would advise this book as an excellent overview of the Mongol empire at its peak.  But, There are bound to be better books out there that go over Mongol specifics.	2002-02-19
US	51386865	R1X25LX63SV2A2	0312020139	321131905	Inventing Reality: The Politics of News Media	Books	5	23	24	N	N	Eye Opener	I've followed Michael around on his lecture circuit, and recently had a chance to read this book.  Michael does an excellent job of exposing the &quot;free&quot; media for what it really is.  He goes into detail on the censorship of newspapers, journalists, and the ridiculous right wing slant that is prevalent in the news today.<br />  Some of his viewpoints are a little sketchy, but most of them hit home and make a terrible amount of sense.  I can safely say that Michael has made a believer out of me.  I look forward to reading his other books.	2002-02-07
US	51386865	R1Z78669UTW5ZD	1585745642	927740100	Night Letters: Inside Wartime Afghanistan	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Into the Heart of the Storm	Rob goes into Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan war, and realizes how plastic and robotic his life is.<br />  There he falls in love with Afghanistan...the people, the land, the animals.  Rob goes on to chronicle many parts of the war, from 1984-1987. The really unique piece, was the eye witness accounts of men and figures that I have read about in texts on the war.<br /> This in itself could have carried the book; but he goes on to do more. For those of us sleepwalking through life, many will find this book a breath of fresh air. The book chronicles his many adventures, tales of the absurd, his fear of being killed, his bouts of depression, and the many hilarious situations that can only occur in war-time Afghanistan.<br /> I think Rob found a piece of his soul in Afghanistan and in turn, he allows the reader to witness some of it. I for one, thank Rob for the oppurtunity.	2002-02-05
US	51386865	RMUVLT65N12QJ	0965310701	546437313	Underground Bodyopus: Militant Weight Loss & Recomposition	Books	5	28	29	N	N	Excellent book on dieting and human digestive processes	I learned more about human digestive processes through this book then anywhere else. Dan goes into minute detail on what makes you grow, what makes you fat, and how to hold onto muscle as you drop weight. He spells out several diets, then he hits the big one \\"Ketogenisis\\" for the really hardcore lifters. (The bodybuilders version of the Atkins diet.)<br /> One thing I liked about Dan is that he doesn't pull any punches and doesn't play the PC game. For people looking for maximum gains (or loss) he tells you to use steroids, insulin and anything else you can get your hands on, in order to improve performance.<br /> I would recommend this book for anyone entering the realm of weight loss, weightlifting or improving his/her diet.	2002-02-04
US	51386865	R3K6DQPYKFBQDO	0714648574	31176586	The Bear Went Over the Mountain:  Soviet Combat Tactics in Afghanistan	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Very Nice Breakdown	I believe this book originally started off as a Military paper, which got published and sold.  Mr. Grau has done a 3 part series on the Afghan-Soviet war.  This is part 1 in the series.<br /><br />  Like the other comments, very easy to read, and to the point.  Goes over specific battles, what happened, and how it all broke down.  The conclusions and commentary at the end of each battle are excellent.  This book works great with the others in the series, esspecially \\"The Other side of the Mountain: Mujahidden Tactics in the Soviet-Afghan War\\" - which does the same thing, but talks about the battles from a Mujahideen standpoint.  The second book is almost impossible to find...... doesn't carry it.  Lastly, there's a third book coming out called \\"Russian General Staff: The Soviet-Afghan War\\" which looks at the war from the general level - I guess overall strategy.<br />  Overall, excellent book on tactics.  And easy enough to read that you don't need to be an officer in the military to understand.	2002-01-14
US	51386865	RYDYQIIO8KY1F	0963834215	46974038	Al-Maqasid: Imam Nawawi's Manual of Islam	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Very Simple - Maybe too simple	This book was written as a manf...which Is used like a memory peg.  The Student would memorzie the manf, and then the shaikh would fill in all the extra bits around that topic.<br />  So the book is very simple.  It only tells the reader what the Fard and the sunnah for each act...based on the Shafi Fiqh.  This is very useful, as most Muslims don't even know the Fard of the Wudu or Ghusl.  A much more detailed book then this is &quot;Reliance of the Traveler&quot; by Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller (Same author).<br />  I would say if you plan on memorizing your obligations as a Muslim, or if you need a quick reference guide of the Fard, this is the book to use.  Otherwise go with &quot;Reliance of the Traveller.&quot;	2002-01-09

Very exciting.	2002-01-02
US	51386865	R2ZTG65S2BIXBO	0892590602	337498529	1: Fiqh Us-Sunnah  Purification and Prayer	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Excellent Series, but very controversial	This book is very popular, and has raised many questions on the authenticity of it's approach.  Many of the Fuqahah disagree with the methodology of Fiqh based on the Sunnah versus Fiqh based on the 4 main madhabs.<br />  I don't know the answer to that question, but I can say the book is very straight forward, easy to read, and hits on every major aspect of Islam.  I've read and reread this series several times, and am quite impressed with the information provided.  All rulings are based on the Quran, Sunnah and hadith.  Recently though, I've started to question the idea of following the fiqh 'us sunnah vs the 4 schools, and thus my opinions on this series is changing.<br />  The book is hardcover, the paper extra thick, and the font is readable and nice.  Very good binding.	2001-12-31
US	51386865	RKJ4BMQLW2BI2	0915957728	527410290	Reliance of the Traveller: The Classic Manual of Islamic Sacred Law Umdat Al-Salik (English, Arabic and Arabic Edition)	Books	5	60	79	N	N	Excellent all the way around	I won't comment on the actual material of the book, since the content is based on Imam Nawawi's work - Which basically says the text is about as good as it gets.<br /> The content of the book covers the Shafi Fiqh. Basically, all rulings that could concern a Muslim.  (ie. Sunnah of Wudu, Fard of divorce proceedings, etc.)  It even has quick autobiographies at the end. (A nice touch for background on some of those scholars I had never heard of.)<br /> As for the rest: The translation into English seems excellent, the book is hardcover with good binding: Excellent. And the cover is green and looks nice. The font is nice, and it even has the original Arabic text on the side. Most important, there are several seals on the first several pages indicating that the book has passed inspection from various large Muslim Universities. Something I don't see in other translations.<br /> Recommended.	2001-12-31

I Recommend it.	2001-12-28

I agree that the author did show some slight bias against the indians, but it was nothing more then any other political book I've ever read.  As far as the book itself, it was non-stop reading, I couldn't put it down.  Very interesting, and a very interesting author.  I would love to hear more of Margolis's adventures.	2001-04-18
