As some reviewers pointed out, a narration here by the protagonist (Mark) is actually so repetitive. Even so, there is such an eagerness in his writing. IMHO, these repetitiveness and eagerness make this novel as if it were really written by the protagonist who is an eighteen-year-old boy. I liked that.	2001-07-01
US	53095875	R13DLANIXRB57J	0804108749	809918350	Saint Maybe	Books	5	26	28	N	N	So gripping even for a foreigner	This is the first time for me to read Anne Tyler's book in English. I have read her three books in Japanese (&quot;Breathing Lessons&quot;, &quot;A Patchwork Planet&quot;, and &quot;Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant&quot;.), and it took just a half of a day to read one book each, as they are so gripping and I just could not put them down.<br />Then I purchased this book from amazon.com to see her original writing style in English, although I am not sure if I can read through this, because I am not a native speaker in English. It turned out that it took me just a week for finishing this book. Again, simply I cannot put it down.<br />This book provoked a mixture feeling, so I cannot describe this book just like &quot;This is fun.&quot; or &quot;This is depressing.&quot; or whatever you would like to say in a hurried manner.<br />What I liked very much is her description of children who still do not learn to speak very much, especially in the 2nd Chapter where Agatha tries to change Daphne's diaper, Thomas still attaches to his favorite doll, and Daphne only speaks &quot;Oho! Oho!&quot;(I do not know how to pronounce it, though). They are so lovable and cute. Anne Tyler effortlessly juggles those children who do not have any logic in their behaviours. Just amazing.<br />Also character development of Ian is almost magical. Some might find his life tragic, but I believe many do not. I am convinced that his life is what he chooses intrinsically. Of course, others might get another interpretation.<br />Interpretation is wide open.	2001-06-09
US	53095875	R1VDFATRHN4W1J	0385494238	654180128	Amsterdam	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Stylish and concise	It's always a pleasure to see such a concisely written modern English novel, while many people tend to mistakenly consider that any worth-reading novel should be thickly written and complicated.<br />But I cannot really  appreciate this novel, as this novel looks like Kundera's novels too much.  Frequent use of musical terms, explicit sexual descriptions, liberal-minded  characters, and so on. In that sense, I cannot understand why this novel  took the Booker Prize, as this novel lacks originality.	1999-08-14

This is written by the man who knows how he can make American people feel good about themselves by not  appreciating cultural differences and by imposing their own rules.  Speaking of &quot;closedness&quot;, there must be much more opportunities  in Japan than now, only if any foreign people speak and write Japanese  fluently. This must be a certain barrier, but it can be easily overcome if  they are humble enough to learn Japanese language, the very essence of  Japanese culture.	1999-07-27

I am sure that you will be amazed by Proust's rare  ability to describe intangible things (smell, tastes, music, etc).<br />If you  really would like to get absorbed in his world, make some tea, get  madeleine, and listen to Gabriel Faure's chamber music.	1999-07-22

Sometimes his writing is rather dutiful, maybe because he tried to inform historical facts about Japan for those who do not know very much about Japan. At least, this is a very serious work. But, almost surprisingly,  there is not much new insights in this book. If you would like to know much  more about Japan, it might be better to read novels by Kenzaburo Oe, Haruki  Murakami, Yukio Mishima, or Soseki Natsume.	1999-01-17

Although it does have flaws in his way of writing compared to other Japanese writers, but it is very entertaining. I really enjoyed seeing a lot of characters here - Toru, his wife Kumiko, Toru's neighbor teenager  May Kasahara, mysterious Malta &amp; Creta Kano sisters, also mysterious  Nutmeg &amp; Cinnamon Akasaka and his dead father, a cursed Lieutenant  Mamiya, a fortune-teller Honda, an ugly Ushikawa, Toru's opponent Noboru  Wataya, scary Russian Boris, straying guitarist, 'duck people' and so on.  Murakami's description of these characters is astonishingly clear. I did  not really like his solution proposed at the very end of this story, but  still worth to read for anybody. I do not know if there is any other book  which is as captivating as this, except Marquez's 'Solitude...'.	1999-01-10

Her writing style is quite eloquent and inspiring. Different from other rather  self-centered novelists (e.g., Dazai, Mishima, Natsume, etc.), she stays as  a objective narrator in her work, and her structiring ability of plot is  almost astonishing. Probably she is  a natally most talented writer in  modern Japan.	1998-11-04

Their books are sometimes very well-written, but they are always too simple in terms of interpretation. Although this book employs  &quot;cook-book&quot; style, but it contains a lot of valuable  inspirations, and practical examples. Her way of writing is very elegant  and also eloquent.

As I am a Japanese who read this book in Japanese when I was a junior high student, I thought this English title is really suitable. The original title in Japanese was &quot;Me-mushiri, Ko-uchi&quot;, which has a some  distinctive rythm in Japanese. Speaking of story, this makes you think very  deeply even though it is a shorter story than other Oe's numerous novels.  It contains racism, autarkic village, and many other things which people  want to avoid to think or see in everyday life. As it was written before  Oe's breaking his own writing style, it is very readable, too.	1998-11-03

Surely this is one of the greatest books in modern astrology. Diffrent from other transit books (e.g., Sakoian &amp; Acker's one), he differentiate transiting Pluto conjunct natal Sun from transiting sun  conjunct natal Pluto, as the former is such a rare and important phenomenon  for one's life and the latter is just an anually one.

Especially if you are going through some  difficult transition period (for example,  trans-saturnian planets are  making tight aspects to your natal personal planets), this is surely  must-read.
