I have also read Harry Potter and the Prisoner from Azkaban, but I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is more exciting.  I like it because it is  adventurous and each person has a unique personality.  Harry has a lot of  problems and ends up in trouble.  Harry is also very famous, which he  doesn't even know.  He lives in a muggle world with his aunt and uncle and  doesn't have any parents.  He also has to deal with his cousin, Dudley, who  always beat him up.  Read Harry Potter to find out what happens next!	1999-10-21

World's Worst Fairy Godmother was a very good book.  I think that it was the very best fiction book I have ever read.  Maybelline is a Fairy Godmother.  Her boss Mr.Peters, gives her one last chance  to do  something right.  He gives Maybelline a little girl named Susan, to teach  her about real love.    Maybelline tries to help her by giving her an  apple that will make her sweet.  Maybelline gets into a big mess, but it  gets fixed.  You should read this book it is a very good book, and I liked  it because it is very funny.  As gor the rest of it you will have to read  it.	1999-10-21

At least once you get over the first 50 or so somewhat childish &quot;my cyberpunk  is cooler than yours&quot; pages. After the long awaited &quot;Snow  crash&quot; enters the story, a near-brilliant, astonishing plot weaves  through fast paced, refreshingly off-beat prose. A true hacker (not  cracker, folks) would love this book.<br />That said, to my knowledge  Stephenson was not the first to use &quot;Avatar&quot;,  &quot;Metaverse&quot; leans on several other similar terms, and Da5id is  just another 3Jane. Odd, since he goes through some trouble to acknowledge  all the archaeological/anthropological/etc. research (although no full  citations are given).	1999-10-20

Nicholson goes on at length about obscure British 'progressive' rock bands  from the 1960s and writes little about Herbie Hancock, Sun Ra, and some  other 'jazz' folk, and some 'jazz-funk/funk-jazz' bands,  which is a task  most other writers wouldn't bother to take on, either because they didn't  know these bands existed or that they weren't worth mentioning. But the  best part, the part Nicholson DOESN'T write, is a great discography of just  about every known 'official' LP and CD release by every known 'jazz-rock'  band - and a few interesting import (usually Japanese)-only and  darker-market releases, too.

The most glaring of which is the authors' annoying predilection for slathering all sorts of praise over European free improv, especially when collective - large ensemble- improv is concerned, e.g.  Peter Brotzmann, Vienna Art Orchestra, etc. Another problem, as I see it,  is the praise free pianist zCecil Taylor receives, without an srgument for  why he is so significant in 'jazz'. So it is difficult to wade through this  kind of often extreme bias and to get to the purpose of the guide, I mean  that a guide is supposed to give the listener an idea of what to seek out -  not a lengthy accolade of the authors favorite artists. At least in my  opinion. Additionally, the authors, occasionally paraphrase the liner notes  of the CDs theyre reviewing - intellectual plagiarism? Or necessarily so?  You decide. I think crriticizing a book of this sort leads to a basic  disagreement over personal preferences, so I'll not gt into that too much.  ZThe above ideas, as well as some of the charges of the other reviewers ,  speak enough of the problems with this book. But if you REALLY want a guide  to jazz, check out the All Music Guide, as it has charts chronicling the  history of the music, and not just specific reviews. So buy both. Or,  better yet buy neither and search the web (or whatever other kind of word  of mouth) for more info on what to buy. Or, pick stuff out at randm and get  an idea of what you like. I hope this review, as with the others, has given  the prospective buyer ajn idea of what this book is about, and whtether  it's worth the $$$ you might shell out.  For what it's worth. Showing MY  bias I must say that I like reading it and occasionally get some good info  out of it.	1999-07-31

Does that make  sense?<br />The characters will confuse you at times, as you wonder what their  motivation is.  We get to see inside the minds of most of them, except for  Caitlin, the most complex of them all.  Why she does what she does, and the  reader's wonderings about what &quot;might have been,&quot; makes the  conclusion to the novel somewhat unsatisfactory.<br />Quite a lot of sexuality  in this book as well...if you're not comfortable with that, leave the book  on the shelf!  Bravo to Judy Blume for being brave enough to acknowledge  the not-quite-sure-what-they-are feelings and wonderings that many of us  felt for our &quot;summer sisters.&quot;<br />A good book...you will laugh and  cry along with the characters, unless you have no soul whatsoever!!	1999-07-29

It does appear fairly even-handed (at least to  me) in terms of the Good/Evil debate that seems to follow Gates everywhere.  What really mars the book is the poor writing of the author. Sayings and  phrases are continually misused to an extent which obscures his meaning. I  found this very surprising for a professional journalist.<br />Not a  particularly interesting addition to the Microsoft canon.	1999-07-29

Or so he says as he begins narrating Anne Tyler's most recent novel.  Divorced, detached from his parents and his child, habitually late and with a history of housebreaking  - how can you trust such a guy?  And yet, here is Anne Tyler to show us  this remarkable, self-loathing, despised &quot;nobody&quot; who does  &quot;nothing&quot; is also a beloved companion, employee, co-worker and  friend.  How can one person be so many things?  How can they not?  <br />A  beautifully crafted story of an ordinary person making his own place in  this world. Fact is, it's one of Tyler's best novels.	1999-07-21

This girl is quite normal. If you demand a macho-man hero for a main character, this book is not for you! This girl proves that with a strong heart and  some good friends you can help save the world (or in this case, the moon)  no matter how big you are. To me, that is true strength. If you haven't  read this book, I encourage you to read all the books in this trilogy (make  sure you read them in order.) It is a fun and gripping series.

How in the heck does one give **** to so many perfectly average movies (like &quot;L.A. Story&quot;) as Ebert does in his  book?  The biggest fault with this annual collection is that it completely  fails in its intention.  Ebert seems to think of this as a more in-depth  version of Leonard Maltin's guide but who needs to read a full-length  review of a movie to determine if it's worth a rental or watching on the  late show?  A better idea for Ebert would be to just issue a complete  volume of his work through the years instead of dumping the same reviews  (with some additional material to make it &quot;new&quot;) on the market  year after year.	1999-06-15

Yes, it takes place (mostly) on mars, features  rocketships and aliens and strange technology, but it is not at all a  science fiction novel.<br />No, this book is a novel about people.  It's a  novel about humanity, told through the eyes of the innocent, the alien, the  lost, and the dying.  It is a series of stories interelated by several  themes.  Do not expect an epic plot or a lovable manin character, because  you will not find either here...instead, you will simply get a sometimes  moving, sometimes thought provoking, and sometimes sad tale that will fill  your vision for some time.

I really loved this book when I was younger, and would be interested to read it again to see if it gives me the same pleasure (a lot of books I used to love don't). I remember liking the contrast between Bonnie and  Sylvia - one feisty and impetuous, the other sweet and meek - it makes me  think now of the contrast between Jane andElizabeth Bennet, or Bella Wilfer  and Lizzie Hexam. Of course I always identified with the feisty one, but  you need the sweet mild one for balance. I also loved hearing about their  escape from Miss Slighcarp and the awful orphanage-type place where they  had to stay. It's true the book is sometimes quite scary and disturbing,  but then so is a lot of Roald Dahl and some of the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;  books - I don't think children should be scared too much, but a little adds  spice to a story.	1999-05-07

As a sister of a violent manic-depressive, I know the alienation, fear, violence, prejudice,  guilt, and neglect that the normal siblings often encounter.  There has always been plenty of literature available for the  mentally ill and their parents, but a lack of material for the siblings.   This book has actual accounts from siblings, and their stories are in  particular very interesting.  A complaint I have is that although the book  cover and title suggest it's targetted at siblings of all mentally ill  persons, it actually concentrates on schizophrenia which has some unique  issues.  The book may have lived up to its title and book cover better if  there had been more representation from siblings of persons with other  mental disorders.  Another complaint I have is that the author suggests  that the trend of returning the mentally ill from institutions to their  family homes is a positive thing.  Most siblings would disagree.  Other  than those complaints, I recommend this book.	1999-05-06

I glanced through another book in this Addison-Wesley  series, it was very basic, but perhaps there will be more interesting ones  coming down the pipe.	1999-04-22

It also contains some nice pictures, though I wish  the Latin in them were translated or shown at a legible size.  It has very  nice appendicies nothing the first appearances of all the characters in the  plays, and a timeline showing what historical events were occuring in  relation to works written by Shakespeare and events in his life, as well as  to plays by other playwrights and other literature produced at that time.   The pages are relatively thin and the print small.  However (this referes  to the '74 edition, maybe they have changed it since then) the plays are a  royal pain to read.  The pages are about a foot high and the notes are at  the bottom.  There is no marking to indicate whether a line has a note, so  the reader must read a line or two, glance down at the notes, read another  few lines, look at the notes again, and so on. Were it not for this major  annoyance, this would be a very good (and very complete) edition of  Shakespeare's works.	1999-04-18

Of the more than 850 shark species,  80 percent would not                            hurt people, or would  rarely encounter them. Sharks and their kin--skates and rays--have                             remained essentially the same for hundreds of millions of  years, and their existence is                            now threatened by  man and his fears. Thomas Allen takes us through the evolution of the                             shark, its folklore, its commercial uses, and gives us  a detailed look at shark                            attacks--where they  happen, why, and how to protect yourself from them. He describes                             over one hundred shark species--their behavior, appearance,  size, and distribution--and                            provides helpful  scientific illustrations. He offers current information on scientific                             research (including the recent studies on shark  cartilage in cancer research), current                             population findings, and the continuing conservation efforts. With over  twenty-five color                            photographs of familiar and  unusual sharks, interesting and fact-filled sidebars, and                             useful appendixes, The Shark Almanac is a comprehensive overview  and the perfect                            book for anyone interested in  these fascinating creatures.	1999-04-13

It is a parable of betrayal and revenge, and describes the relationship between two men, one boring and ordinary (Philip), the other  flamboyant and charismatic (Dunster), who have known each other since  school. We meet them in middle age, when Dunster has just run off with his  friend's wife. Dunster's confidence comes from his belief in his own  abilities, especially his judgement of other people. Philip, by chance,  gets the opportunity to undermine Dunster's judgement, which destroys  Dunster. Ironically, it is Dunster's inability to grasp what Philip (or  anybody) is capable of that leads to his undoing. Dunster has the  charismatic man's belief that he can treat his friends how he likes because  he's doing them a favour just by being there. Mortimer shows that even the  most placid of people won't forgive if you treat them badly enough, no  matter how charming you are.	1999-01-27

It talks about sky objects that are ignored by just about  every other book out there, but that are *easily* visible through  binoculars!  Guess none of the other binoculars books bothered to really  research the topic.<br />But now, the book has gotten even better with the new  Touring the Universe Through Binoculars Atlas CD-ROM.  A great value for  the price too!  I first looked for it on Amazon.com, but I guess they don't  sell it. (hey, Amazon! hint hint).  I ended up buying it right through  Harrington's home page.  Together, the book and CD are the most complete  survey of the binocular sky ever created!  My advice is to buy the book  here and get the CD separately.  If you like binocular observing as much as  I do, they make a great team.	1999-01-26

What this book secretly advocates is world slavery. What ever do the  author/editors believe the United States was fighting against in the  Revolutionary War against King George's British Empire.  Don't they  understand that America was fighting British Empire &quot;Free Trade&quot;  aimed at stealing raw materials from the colonies, forcing them to buy  British manufactured goods, thereby forcing the colonies to remain backward  and undeveloped, just as England does today with their &quot;colonies&quot;  in Africa.

He takes mundane, ordinary situations from suburban life and in his uniquely pleonastic way subverts them. Quantity Theory is less  mature than some of his later books, and some of the short stories come  across as overly contrived.  He also suffers from a journalistic pedigree,  he is more interested with style and form, than plot; and his content tends  to be intellectual puzzles and mind-games, which though frequently amusing,  are often insubstantial.	1999-01-12

All attempts of  originality have failed.  Using the lower case &quot;i&quot; by itself and craming  words, &quot;nothingnotmuch...&quot; is an imitation of e.e. cummings.   Also her radical line breaks resemble those of Octavio Paz. The themes in  her book are elementary, they're about love, pain, etc....  Also in her  introduction she forgot to credit Jim Morrison, who was also a major  contributor in &quot;forging the bridge from poetry to music.&quot;  It is  easy to derail jewel because she isn't an academic poet.  The literary  world hasn't taken her in. The ones who like this book are mostly her music  fans, which was the intended target.	1998-12-17

From a deliberately understated beginning, Golding gently increases the pace until the book literally tears into the reader's soul.  Ralph, Piggy, Jack, Simon, et al, are all characters who represent more  than simply a literary metaphor; rather they bring with them a mood and a  concept.

The novel &quot;A Seperate Peace&quot;, written by John Knowles, is a story about two friends going through adolescence during World War II. The boys were attending a boarding school in New England, by the name of Devon.  The story is told through the thoughts of Gene. He is mainly thinking about  his friend Phineas.  I enjoyed reading this novel beause Knowles kept  me interested with Gene and Finny's in depth character developement, and  the suspense throughout the book. In my opinion, Knowles' portrayal of the  hardships of friendship was accurate. While reading this novel I was  reminded of another book &quot;The Outsiders&quot;. &quot;The  Outsiders&quot; is also about a group of young men going through a  difficult period with no parents around. Another component that was common  in both novels was the physically and emotionally harmful effect of  jealousy. Some adults may believe that teenagers do not have many problems;  this book will make them think otherwise.	1998-11-03

I am a complete novice to high-end 3D imaging (previous experience -  Web3D, Bryce) but after this book don't feel myself as such anymore. Not  good if you need a crash course on some software package but for  fundamental understanding of general and advanced concepts it is something  incredible no less. Being myself a person who prefer to learn software by  trying and playing with it rather then by reading books i found it very  frustrating when i wanted to do the same with some advanced 3D tools  (Lightwave to be exact). After this book i feel that i got enough  understanding of the 3D fundamentals to learn any package. At least i know  where to begin now. Software-independent approach did not prevent this book  from having many examples from the real world packages so a lot of the  information is easily applicable but the insider understanding you get of  many many aspects involved in 3D art process is what truly invaluable.  Finally, all that jargon mambo-jumbo explained!	1998-10-21

Neal Stephenson is a brilliant mind, but got a little too mixed up with  Jolt (perhaps). I was reading this book, and had a jolly good time, until I  got to &quot;Part Deux&quot;, and then I said to myself, &quot;this guy  sucks.

When I began to read the  first couple of words, I knew that this would be one book that I would not  be able to put down. I often found myself reading the book while taking  tests, taking a bath, while exercising, and sometimes while riding in the  car. I think that the reason it caught my attention was because some of the  issues that Mrs. LaBelle faced, I have gone through also. Although I am  only sixteen years old, I have been in similar situations. Like Patti, I  have often feared death, and I let that bother me for so long. I have lost  an aunt, tragically, and me not being able to say to her what I needed to  say still haunts me. After reading the book, I've learned to deal with my  problems, as did Patti. I know Mrs. LaBelle will remain a true inspiration  in my life because through her book, and through God, she has helped me to  learn to never block the blessings. I believe that if America were to live  by this motto, it would be a much better place. We need more people , like  Mrs. Patti LaBelle, to speak out and help make this world a better haven. I  commend her and may God continously bless her. I  will remain her number  one fan!!!	1998-08-23

I read this book about Roan and Claire and was delighted.  <br />I read &quot;Hear on Earth&quot; by Alice Hoffman right afterward.  It was an Oprah book club selection and got great reviews.  It's essentially the same tale but much, much darker with a violent ending.<br />The Kirkus review of &quot;A Place Called Home&quot; calls it &quot;A cloyingly sweet love story whose willful heroine and grudge-bearing hero remain strangely unsympathetic.&quot;  Do reviewers have a bad attitude or what am I missing?  Why do they always seem to pan uplifting tales?  <br />If I'm going to read for enjoyment I want to be  optimistic about the possibilities in life, not constantly hammered at with twisted psyches and violent motives.	1998-07-08

Title:  Secrets of a Super Hacker - Author: The Knightmare - Publisher: Loompanics Unlimited - Date:  1994 - Pages: 205 - Audience: Hacker Wanna Be  - Covers: Extremely Dated Hackerish Stuff - SLP Rating:  1 - CD:  N/A<br />Comments: Everyone should have one of these in their library just so that they'll know that anyone can write a book.  This book gives hackers a bad name.  One read and you'll understand why most hackers have to be persistent to break into systems, they sure don't understand them.  The book covers shoulder surfing, dumpster diving, social engineering, on-site hacking, at home hacking, hacking with public access computers, and a really neat section on Bar Codes (sigh).  The techniques covered would have you caught, laughed at by your peers, and thrown in jail before you even get your feet wet, so be warned.  The appendices were useful in that they contain most default accounts, per major O/S's of the time. Too bad that this information was dated even before this book was published.  Believe it or not the commonly used passwords section is still useful for systems that don't support PQC (Password Quality Control). Although, with a hex keypad, a bit of string, a fifth of whiskey, and a masochistic urge and I'll prove PQC is a myth. Give your boss a copy as a scare tactic, just don't tell him that you no longer have the PDP's with the bar code readers and the line printer consoles.  He'll either give you that security budget or buy you a copy of the Dilbert Principle in return.  What, my job?  I'm an anti-hacker so maybe I should give it a five star rating?  Go ahead, buy it, read it, use it, suffer it.	1998-06-20

I first read this book when I was 10 and instently fell in love with it, and have since re-read the book at least 20 times. The book definetly keeps you on your toes and you never want to put it down(belive me I know, my 9th grade german teacher constintly had to tell me to put it away) the book would have gotten a 10 from me if not for the fact that alot of the Dinosaur information is a little off, for example. Velociraptors ar NOT 6 FEET TALL more like 3 the animal that possed such a threat resembles the Utah Raptor. and as for the fact that Dilophosaurs had 'Manes' and could 'Spit' poison has never been proven. and finaly the T-rex can only see movement? I doubt it! T-rex's had excelent vision! but other than a few 'Dino-misprints' the book excells and keeps you woundering 'is he going to die?. can she jump and make it into the pool?' well you'll just ahev to find out.

With his festation for detail, and well drawn out descriptions, it easy for one to get bored. And many times I was, at times I was too confused by the multiple plots lines that seemed to have no connection what so ever.  But Tom Clancy, the modern day literary genius, seems to have a magical way of making all the plot lines somehow connect into one damn good story.  His precise detail when it came to explaining the intricacies of the new Japenese surveilence plane , as well as the inner workings of the Securites and Exchange Commission are better learnings then some college courses.  If you can make it through the first one-hundred pages with out throwing it away, then you will be thoroughly gratified by a great a piece of literary genius	1997-04-25
