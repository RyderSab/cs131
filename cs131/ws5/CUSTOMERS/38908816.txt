Instead it was the usual \\"build a platform, do a lot of speaking engagements, make a professional press kit\\" type stuff. I've heard it all a million times, and it's available everywhere. Still I give the book 3 stars for being well written and well organized. For a book that has the usual as well as more unusual ideas, I'd recommend 1001 Ways to Market Your Books by John Kremer.	2005-09-09

If she is so creative, why is she writing the same book over and over, year after year (or sometimes twice a year)? She needs to take her own advice: take some time for the well to fill up again. Hers has obviously run dry. It's getting to be rather sad, and embarrassing.	2005-08-29

It was interesting enough to keep me entertained on a boring business trip and plane ride, but overall not a big intellectual thrill. The list of books that the club read, the little descriptions, and their discussions of the books gave me a few good ideas of books to read (some classic). I would have liked the book discussions to be a little longer, and segue into their personal dramas a little more cleverly.	2005-08-11

This one just didn't engage me. It seemed so same-old, same-old; Snape with his greasy hair and malevolent gaze, evil Malfoy, awkward Ron, weeping Hagrid, wise and mysterious Dumbledore, blah blah blah. Nothing really clever or surprising. No character development and little plot. Now I see the beauty in trilogies; enough is enough. Rowling has never again come close to the third book, The Prisoner of Azkaban.  <br /> <br />I doubt I'll want to read the 7th book but I'll be curious as to what happens so I'll read the synopsis on Wikipedia.	2005-08-11

The subtitle is \\"Whole foods to nourish pregnant and breastfeeding women-and their families\\" but its usefulness will go on long after the woman of the house is pregnant and breastfeeding. The meals are simple to prepare, nourishing, and will appeal to all types of palates, from the very basic to the fussy to the adventurous. One standout feature is that each recipe, aside from displaying nutritional data, details key nutrients. So, it's easy to see which recipes contain nutrients important to pregnancy and lactation like iron, folate, and so on, and in what quantities. <br /> <br />I sure wish I had this book when I was pregnant and breastfeeding. It's so much better than that ridiculous \\"What to Eat When You're Expecting,\\" so much friendlier, and not the least judgemental.  <br /> <br />My \\"babies\\" are now vegan teens and we all enjoyed Cathe's Miso-Noodle Soup,  Tofu Enchiladas, Pasta with Vegetables and Pine Nuts, and others. I have numerous post-its throughout the book marking recipes to be tried. I have lots of cookbooks in my kitchen aimed at more general audiences, but this cookbook for vegetarian moms will prove far more useful than most.	2005-03-22

It covers everything from baby basics (pear-applesauce) to more challenging toddler fare (baby stir-fry), and everything inbetween. Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grain fare is included. I'm not going to wait until I have grandchildren to use this book, however. Banana-Oatmeal Cookies, Pineapple Carrot Cake, and a bountiful Minestrone are among several easy recipe I'm looking forward to feeding my family very soon!	2005-03-10

Though I suppose that in the past, the \\"popular\\" books were not the ones that survived the test of time, much as, I'm certain, these won't, either. <br /> <br />The Lovely Bones was a decent read, though given the subject matter, oddly devoid of emotion. There are some aspects that are disturbing, which is okay, but others that are downright silly. But when I got to the scene where Suzie enters her friend's body so she can have sex with Ray, I just lost it. This is SOOOO Hollywood and such a cheap trick. Well, at least I am forewarned, not to see the movie version, which I'm sure will play up this totally stupid scene. This ruined the book for me.	2004-09-25

I detest the right wing and admire the way Al takes them down a few pegs to their &quot;right&quot;-ful subhuman level. He takes actual facts and applies his considerable wit to expose truth. I liked this book better than Dude, Where's My Country by Michael Moore; though I agreed with MM's message I didn't like the way the book was one long rant. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars only because I think parts of it went on too long, just like a Saturday Night Live skit that doesn't know where to end. However, I'd recommend this to anyone as a solid and enjoyable read.	2004-01-27

It almost feels as if she can't really write, it's just that she had better editors at her other publisher.

The book seems to be a classic and that I can understand. But I pulled out the tape to listen to after not having heard it for some time and it seemed so out of date. Some parts were almost embarrassing, and in all was a mishmosh of biblical, new age, and groovy girl advice.

I listened to about half of the audiotape, waiting for something, anything to happen, aside from a bunch of whining and meandering dialog. While &quot;slice of life&quot; novels can be great, this one just had nothing to give it forward momentum. Sometimes, things were too ordinary, and other times, too hard to believe, such as that a 7-year-old would become practically suicidal because his  dad's girlfriend was expecting. Halfway through this long slog, I was just so bored, I gave up. Overall, a mess of a novel. I expected more from Anne Lamott.	2003-10-29

Somehow, the cookbook is a disappointment, mainly due to inaccuracies in the recipes. I was all set to make the Asian Baked Tofu, for instance. The instructions say to cut the tofu into 3 blocks, then marinate. The recipe is supposed to serve 4, but there is no further instruction on how the tofu is to be cut further. The chocolate mousse pie came out well, but the proportions of the ingredients are enough to make 2 pies; also I'm glad I left out 1/2 cup of water called for in the cake crust, or it would have been too moist and soupy. not to go on, though there are other such examples. These little innacuaracies can make or break a recipe, so though I'm looking forward to trying a few more, I feel I need to be wary.<br />The photos in the middle of the book are lovely, but the pages and layout of the recipes are pretty dry, The small fractions sent me running for my reading glasses.<br />For me, the book rates three stars, but I'm giving it four for the general devoted veg/vegan reader, plus the fact that I'm such a fan of the cafe that I don't have the heart to give it just three stars.	2003-09-22

While this one wasn't bad, it was bloated. Some good editing would have made the story more taut, and with a better flow. I agree with one reviewer who said there was an awful lot of standing around and talking, blah, blah, blah. I don't think there was good inter-character development. And even my 11 and 14 year old sons got extremely annoyed with her constantly using the same characterizations...Luna Lovegood always saying things \\"vaguely,\\"  everyone shuddering and wincing when Voldemort's name is mentioned, etc.<BR>There was little of the cleverness and light comic relief she is known for; everyone seemed constantly in a bad mood. I also thought some plot elements were superfluous, such as the Grawp the giant. There could have been more quidditch, too. I was disappointed that she killed off an important character. Still, it's a fast 900-page read so I'm confident she'll find that magic again.	2003-09-11

For those entrenched in the creative life, this mature sequel is excellent. Even those of us who seem to have creative careers can easily start spinning our wheels, getting stale, etc. That's where I was at when I started this book. I did the Artist's Way a couple of times and it was very helpful. The first sequel, The Vein of Gold, was fun to read but I didn't resonate with the exercises and examples. In Walking in this World, I feel that every chapter is a refreshing wake-up call of a different sort. Julia Cameron truly understands every nuance of the creative life. The tasks are simple, fun, but very revealing. I am mid-way through the course and already have found a renewed sense of energy and optimism, a very welcome respite during this horrible war with Iraq. The arts are and always will be important, for they define a culture. Without the arts and creative expression, we have no civilization. Thank you, Julia, for helping so many of us make this a more positive world through the creative arts.	2003-03-30

I spent a couple of hours reading Romancing the Ordinary in a Borders a few days ago, and decided not to buy it. It's boring, to be blunt, and I was expecting more of a simple &quot;to do&quot; book to awaken the senses. Parts are downright pretentious. I really feel no need to own or read this book; I will continue to re-read passages from Simple Abundance for many years to come. I find it sad when talented nonfiction writers re-write the same book over and over again (think Natalie Goldberg, Julia Cameron).

I'm puzzled as to why this readable, intelligent book hasn't found a wider audience. It's compelling, well-written, and chock-full of fascinating characters and details. Despite the fact that there are several sub-plots and the author takes you back and forth in time, the book as a whole has a wonderful forward momentum that keeps me riveted, even on the second reading, in which I already know what is going to happen.<BR>     I think Celeste Ascending is better than the abysmally dull Atonement, which stays on bestseller lists, the overstuffed, over-the-top, overrated The Corrections, which wins awards, and Elizabeth Berg's predictable, pablum novels, which always break through.<BR>    Kayle Jones, if you read this, I hope you are writing another book. You are very talented and with persistence, your books will find the wide audience they deserve.	2002-09-17

He's a knowledgable and compassionate writer and educator. That's why I can't believe he'd want to be associated withthis  book. I perused it thoroughly in a bookstore and would never waste money buying it. The desserts chapter is filled with entries that contain butter, white flour, and sugar. I can assure you that my own &quot;healthy kitchen&quot; contains none of these, yet we make fabulous desserts using healthier ingredients. Many of the recipes also struck me as far too complicated for the average, busy cook. That's what happens often when a chef writes a cookbook. It's a shame that because of the name recognition factor alone, this book is a best seller. I agree with a lot of the other reviewers that it not only breaks no new ground but treads very questionable ground. I also am disappointed that Dr. Weil would be associated with a book that uses poultry. Not everyone is going to make the effort to get free-range, and the poultry business is one of the nastiest around. I wish he had stuck to his convictions. At least one recipe uses 2 cups of low-fat grated cheese. UGH! If one were to use cheese, it's better to use a smaller amount of real organic cheese.  I hope the admirable Dr. Weil stays on his own for his next book. There are a lot of people who depend on his wisdom, and with this one, he lets a lot of people down.	2002-04-21
