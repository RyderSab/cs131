I was expecting this book to be as good.  As I began to read it, I became concerned about the connection the author was making between the Sefirot and the black arts/demon worship.  However, the further I got into the book, the more bored I became until I could no longer concentrate.  This book is not at all comparable to The Name Of The Rose, either in content or skill.	2005-04-10

There are several relationships studied -- that of Anna and Alexey Karenina (which fails because Anna leaves Alexey for Vronsky), Anna Karenina and Vronsky, Dolly and Stiva Oblonsky, and Kitty Shtcherbatskaya and Kostya Levin.  Each relationship is different and the manner in which each couple works through the issues that might/do tear them apart is interesting.  Also interesting is the manner in which Tolstoy turns this otherwise secular novel into a \\"Christian\\" novel.	2005-02-14

It is almost as if the author was leading to an event that he didn't know was coming!  Too bad Bush and the leading members of Congress didn't have a chance to read it before 9/11.

I wonder if he has been able to make contact with his children now that the regime of Saddam Hussein is over -- and what his second wife may think of that.  Perhaps his book deserves a sequel.  However, when did he marry?  That was left out of the story.  Obviously, he must have been married before his falling out with Uday because he had to smuggle his wife out of Iraq.  Who was his wife?  Who arranged his marriage or when did he have time to find a wife?  It says he had known her since childhood.  But he wasn't permitted to have contact with his old friends?  I think some things were left out to make Saddam, Uday, and Qusay look even worse than they were.  That is not to say the world is worse with the Saddam Hussein family out of power in Iraq.	2004-06-06

My husband is retired Navy, a veteran of the riverine war in Vietnam.  My husband read this book and recommended it to me, not on the basis of the character (or lack thereof) of John Kerry but because the descriptions and history of the riverine war were accurate.  For those who want to disparage the book, there are numberless accounts of Vietnam veterans whose time in-country lasted a day or lasted five years.  My husband reads every one he can get his hands on, so I know they are out there.  That he recommended this to me above so many others he has read is because, in his words, &quot;this one is accurate.&quot;  Forget that John Kerry happens to be the sailer in question and study the Vietnam War.	2004-06-03

How many of these accusations against Catholic priests are real and how many are memories that have been created by over-zealous psychiatrists/psychologists/therapists?  The same must be asked about Michael Jackson.  I don't know of many of these accusations made while the abuse was an on-going event -- which is what causes the author to question accusations made years after the fact.  Although, I also question the some of what the author says.  I myself have a year missing from my memory but I have never made an attempt to fill that year with anything that might make logical/illogical sense.  I know many others that have large gaps in their memories -- one inparticular whose childhood I remember better than he does.  What would happen if we went to therapists that believed in the hynosis analysis of that missing time?  Would we also be dredging up memories of abuse?  Interestingly enough, I have little doubt that we would, especially as we both have active imaginations without help of hypnosis. Interesting book.	2004-03-05

As a refresher, it was good.  The exercises at the end of each chapter are excellent.  The writing of the instructions doesn't really help with planning a novel -- or maybe it does as it continues the same instructions for each chapter -- as there seems to be only one idea that continues on through.

I didn't quite understand why some of the things happened the way they happened to bring up the end.  I think the author had basically run out of ideas to stay to the ending he anticipated.  I guess that's because I could picture an ending wtih more finality and he left himself open for further stories in the future.  Also, I had trouble picturing Humphrey Bogart as the character of Rick as this author portrayed him.  If one forgets that it is based on CASABLANCA, then one might be tempted to rate it a 4.	2004-02-09

This book is not up to par with some of his other works, however.  Perhaps it is because these are cases that remain unsolved and much that he would use in &quot;working cases&quot; has been muddied by years of mystery.  Perhaps the best thing he says is that all killings deserve equality in the press -- that the press shouldn't single some cases out because of some sensational in the case, whether it be the brutality or the wealth of the family.  Everyone deserves for their suffering to receive equal attention.	2003-09-19

It was interesting to see that Ms. Tey has developed a theory as to why, after theories have been proven historically inaccurate, the theory continues to be held to as Gospel Truth.  Tandypony.

I was wishing the book had been available in the 1970s and 1980s when I was taking Western Culture in the university.  As much as I admire the professor I had for that subject (and he wrote the book we used for the course), I wish this had been the text instead.  Regardless of what some of those who disliked the book have written, the book is very understandable, the themes are easy to follow, and it is very clear that no one has had an original idea in his/her head since 1914.

After 70 some years of welfare and social security and \\"silver platter\\" treatment, I don't think this country could possibly retreat from that -- although it might still be possible to \\"wean\\" people off welfare.

This is an interesting book for those interested in adding a remembrance of the role of the woman to their Pesach seder.  However, it very much revels the &quot;anti-men&quot; sentiment of many feminists in that complaints are made about the &quot;all male&quot; celebration of the seder (which was never my experience) while admitions are made that some of the seders organized by women are &quot;all women&quot; and even little boys are not permitted to attend -- reference &quot;Sanctified by Ritual&quot; by Phyllis Chesler (pages 213 to 220) and &quot;Pluralism in Feminist Settings&quot; by Martha Achelsberg (pages 229 to 234).  How can women complain about &quot;male only&quot; anything when they exclude men because &quot;some women are uncomfortable praying with men&quot;?  Is it not possible that some men are uncomfortable praying with women?  Is it possible that some women think that men do not suffer from discomfort in the presence of women?  As a woman, I believe that having some degree of separateness between the genders is a good thing -- but it must be a two-way street.  Women must allow men their separate times as well as setting aside some rituals for themselves.  Women are different from men.  Women do not experience life in the same way as men.  Women have a different approach to the religious experience and that difference should be recognized -- and celebrated.  Perhaps the mechitzah is not such a bad thing -- and perhaps the Orthodox should recognize 10 women as consisting as a minyan separate from a male minyan of 10 men without recognizing a mixed minyan.	2003-04-11

This book is written from the point of view of the child Ung was when these events were transpiring.  I don't know that she still harbors some of the views that she expressed -- for example, her hatred of the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot.  I would like to believe that she no longer harbors the same amount of hatred that she most certainly and understandably felt as a child growing up in those circumstances.  Are there things from which she was shielded?  Probably.  As she was only 8 years old when she escaped from Cambodia, how much of what happened DIDN'T she understand?  How much of what she experienced is expressed in her memory as racial hatred?  I think, from the fact that she uses the present tense throughout the book, that she is trying to express those emotions felt by a child too young to truly understand what was happening but was forced to experience these things anyway.  I think it would be a good read for a child psychologist who may have to deal with future war-torn, terrorized children.	2002-12-19

Robert Clary was NOT in a \\"death camp.\\"  He was in a \\"forced labor camp.\\"<br />Second, based on what I have heard from him in several documentaries made for PBS, Robert Clary has a lot more that he could have said in his autobiography.  He was obviously holding back on information or censoring his experiences.  My feeling was that he would take his experiences to the moment of pain and then pull away from them.  As much as I liked Robert Clary as Corporal Louis Lebeau on Hogan's Heroes and as a narrator of Holocaust documentaries, I must admit that his writing is not as intense as I was expecting.	2002-12-19

Much of it dove-tails with what Rabbi Yonassan Gershom has written about those who died during the Holocaust and have been reborn as blond haired-blue eyed Gentiles.  Except that Dr. Stevenson's cases seem to lose their memories of the events in their previous lives at about age 7 or 8 and Rabbi Gershom's cases seem to be forever haunted by their experiences.  One other thing I found disturbing about Dr. Stevenson's work is that the majority of his cases are from India, Burma, and Thailand, where reincarnation has been acceptable many centuries longer than it has been acceptable in our Western culture.  It makes it much easier to doubt his cases than if the majority of his cases were from a culture that was less accedpting of the theory.	2002-02-20

It consists of quotes from the works of various kabbalists without any explanation as to why the author decided to include those quotes.

There is no thread that follows unbroken from the Catholic Modernists of the turn of the Twentieth Century to the turn of the Twenty-first Century in what the author has offered.  I feel as if the author was trying to justify the reason for studying the philosophical history of the ninteenth century by saying such history has led to today's Catholic Church by just making the jump from circa 1900 to circa 2000.  It doesn't work for me.  Thumbs down.	2001-10-03

My husband, a Vietnam veteran, read this book and recommended it to me.  I'm glad he did!  It is a wonderful explanation of the stupidity of those in charge of our policy during that time period.  John-Paul Vann may not have had all the answers but he certainly saw that what we were doing was not the answer and had viable suggestions as to what might have worked had the policy been implimented immediately.  I'm not saying the U. S. was wrong getting involved in Vietnam (although, after reading this book, I'm not sure we were right, either); I am saying that the policy of those people who were charged with winning that conflict was a policy guaranteed to bring about the most destruction, the most loss of American lives, and the least co-operation by the Vietnamese peasants as possible.  This book sheds a lot of light on what the news media was trying to say and why the public didn't understand what the news media was trying to say.  Excellent book!!!!	2001-08-05

I admit that it starts out slow.  The first victim is a person of no consequence and his death could have easily been an accident but it gives Kysen something to do.  However, things really get rolling when the murderers start trying to cover their tracks to keep Kysen from learning something, which gets Lord Meren's attention.  The setting in ancient Egypt also makes it a good escape from the everyday.	2001-07-04

The book is an alternative history, the imaginings of an historian as to what history would have been like had Burgoyne won at Saratoga as opposed to Schuyler, Gates, and Arnold.  The book begins well but, as it continues, it becomes less logical.  There are a number of factors the author does not take into account or simply ignores -- for example, that Mexico in 1776 was controlled by Spain, that the Spanish Inquisition would not have permitted the mostly-Protestant rebels from the English colonies to flee into Mexico, and that the majority of the rebels probably would have rather faced the hangman's rope at the hands of the British that to put themselves under the reign of the Spanish king.  It also ignores the latent anti-Semitism of Germany -- or is it that the author has some anti-Semitic leanings since the Jews as a group are never mentioned but the Palestinian Arabs are?  I do not recommend this book.	2001-07-01

The detective is a member of Pharoah's court -- his title is Eyes and Ears of Pharoah, so I suppose one could say he was the chief of the Secret Police or something along those lines.  There is something refreshing about a murder mystery set in ancient times -- introducing the reader to not only a different culture but a totally different mindset.  (Plus showing that murders were achieved long before guns and sometimes in ingenious manners.)  Excellent book!	2001-05-28

The eldest of these three children was originally named Virginia, but she took the name Suor Maria Celeste when she became a nun at the age of sixteen.  She had been placed in a monastery run by the Poor Clares at the age of thirteen, along with her twelve year old sister Livia.  Both joined the Order.  Maria Celeste, even in the monastery, became Galileo's greatest support and confidante, even to assisting his supporters to destroy and alter papers that might have been damaging to him while he was on trial by the Inquisition in 1633.  She died on 2 April 1634, not yet 34 years of age, as a result of the stress and anxiety caused by her father's trial and punishment.  Years later, when the Catholic Church finally permitted the body of Galileo to be moved to a tomb of honor, it was discovered that Vincenzio Viviani, forbidden to make the tomb for Galileo that he had wanted and forced to bury his mentor in a less honorable condition, moved the body of Maria Celeste to share the grave of her father.  When his body was moved to the tomb of honor, she was moved with him so that she still shares in his glory.  However, the book was more a biography of Galileo than it was a biography of his daughter.  In that, I was disappointed.	2001-05-25

This is the story of a bridge, built by the Turks in the sixteenth century, the gift to his homeland of Grand Vizer Mehmed Pasha.  The bridge is the hero and the location of the story, which is the history of a town based on what happened on and around the bridge.  When reading it, one finds it difficult to believe that it was allowed to be published in a Communist country!  At any rate, the author gives equal treatment to the Moslems, Christians, and Jews that live in the town that grew up around the bridge. In fact, one of the most hard-working and lovable characters is a Jewish woman named Lotte, who manages the hotel owned by her brother-in-law.  I highly recommend the book, although you should read it in a different printing edition than the one I read as the quality of the material used was very bad -- pages started falling out of the book before I was even halfway finished...	2001-05-25

This was an interesting book that really fired the curiousity about learning about your past lives but the author never really explains what things mean.  For example, there is a whole chapter of questions regarding things you like, things you don't like, and why but no explanation as to what your answers might mean.  A few examples along the way might have been helpful.  There were examples of other things so as to explain a concept but no real help for the reader to understand their own answers to the questions.

Black Lamb and Grey Falcon was her magnum opus, published in 1941, after Yugoslavia had been conquered by the Nazis.  This book is not only a travelogue through the Yugoslavia of the mid-1930s but it is a history of the region from the time of the Romans until the fall to the Nazis in 1941.  A lot of what she has to say explains the problems that exist in the region today and why there must be a U. N. Peacekeeping Force there.

The language and the imagery invoked is breath-taking.  In the area of  subject matter, it is rather unique.  An Irish woman journeys to Mexico  just after the Mexican Revolution and becomes involved with two men who  have taken it upon themselves to return Mexico to the religion of  Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli. She joins them to become the First Woman  of Malintzi and wife of the First Man of Huitzilopochtli.  However, in the  area of social language, the book is a product of its time.  The Mexican  people -- and all &quot;dark&quot; people -- are the objects of  particularly malignant language, which I found objectionable.  As an  historian, I can place the book in its proper perspective, however, and  recommend it as a good read.	2000-03-16

This is a fictional account of the Battle of Thermopylae from the point of view of one helot soldier of the Spartan army.  The book starts with how he was orphaned at a young age, spent time hiding in the forests with his  cousin and their mentor, then how he came to Sparta.  A lot of the book  involved the training of Spartan soldiers and how the philosophies of  Sparta differed from the philosophies of the remainder of Greece so that  the Spartans had such a fearsome military.  It also told the story of how  Spartan women were trained and were considered different from the other  Grecian women, how Spartan women were actually trained in military matters  and were freer than their contemporaries in Athens and elsewhere.  Then the  last quarter of the book deals with the actual Battle of Thermopylae.  The  300 Spartan warriors knew before they marched out of Sparta that they were  to die in this battle, that they were a sacrifice to buy the rest of Greece  time to plan a major battle against the Persians, that they were to hold  out as long as they could but to die fighting.  It was an excellent  book!  I could hardly put it down.  A comment to the reviewer who  complained that there was no mention of homosexual love -- there was also  no mention of heterosexual love.	2000-02-15

The photographs are beautiful but the writing style lacks the punch necessary for how-to books and the reading is made more  difficult by the injection of examples of different &quot;kitchen  gardens&quot; in the midst of the chapters.  Also, the gardens discussed  are not such as could be duplicated by the average gardener, who does not  have several acres of land to turn into a landscaped masterpiece.	2000-02-10

The book was well-written and does supply some historical detail for thought.  That the Freemasons are the theoritical descendents of the Knights Templar is not a new theory; however, the idea that the Priory of  Sion, an anti-Semitic group with links to the Nazi Party of Germany, having  been the moving force behind the Knights Templar is a little hard to  swallow.  Why, if I may be so bold, if the doctrinal theory behind the  Priory of Sion is Egyptian and Isian, is it anti-Semitic when the Jewish  religion has little to do with Egyptian religion?  A great deal of time is  spent on the different writings involving the quest for the Holy Grail.  It  has been proven that the King Arthur/Knights of the Round Table/Quest for  the Holy Grail is the beginning of the violent anti-Semiticism that  eventually led to HaShoah.  The author does not attempt to explain this  anamoly.  Surely, if the basis for these is the Isian religion and the  &quot;inner circle&quot; of these groups are in agreement with the Talmud  about the reason for Jesus' execution, they would not be persecuting the  Jews but joining forces with the Jews against the Church.  The authors need  to do some explaining along these lines.	2000-02-06

It was hard to put down and the poetry of the descriptions was at times  breath-taking and at times gory.  However, the true history of the church  does not include the legend that Peter died in Rome. The historical Peter  and Paul were never more than enemies.  Also, the mention of the Jews was  from Christian anti-Semiticism and not history.  I did enjoy reading it.	2000-01-23

The book is written with a good sense of humor; for example, her final comment about ticks.  She also recognizes that there are some &quot;problems&quot; that  can not be solved, they are just part of being a dog, while other problems  that people say are just part of being a dog can be solved.  I enjoyed the  book and have started trying her method on my German Shepherd, who  back-talks as bad as any teenager when told to do something.	2000-01-09

As I read further, however, I started to notice that  the greatest majority of ghost stories WERE from Bed and Breakfast Inns or  Restaurants or other public places that might find financial benefit from  being mentioned in a book about hauntings.  At this point, I began to  become disillusioned about the stories.	1999-12-26

This is an interesting book regarding the means by which a person comes to love others.  The idea of making space for others within one's life is novel and yet, when you think about it, very true.  To say that you are  &quot;one&quot; with another person is somewhat faulty, as the author  points out, because neither individual is swallowed so that they lose their  identity.  When that happens, then there is trouble within the  relationship.  It was quite interesting.	1999-12-16

Dixon Jones in 1894.  Based on the advertising, I expected the book to be about the two trials, the evidence involved and  the courtroom machinations of the lawyers.  Instead, it is a tiresome  rendering of the history of gynecology, women's rights (or lack thereof),  and disagreements in the medical profession.  I found the style more  academic than popular and suggest that the author was aiming more at the  professional historian than the casual reader.  Even for the professional  historian, there is a great draught of facts surrounding the trials and  there is more information on the history of gynecology as well as unproven  speculation as to the effects of the trial on the medical community of  Brooklyn.	1999-12-12
US	52435894	RRWDHG6NA7RH5	0446606456	764304761	An Isolated Incident	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Couldn't put it down	This book is a well-written suspense.  I thought I had the mystery figured out in the first two or three chapters and was reading to verify that I was correct.  The author never once loses sight of making the reader believe  that the police are on the right track, that the real killer has been  released on a technicality, that the sniper has a good motive even though  he is legally wrong.  The identity of the killer is not revealed until the  last paragraph -- but when the reader reviews the clues, the solution is  airtight.  I couldn't put the book down.	1999-12-08

The first thing I would say is that the author, as an investigator, was not  &quot;independent&quot; as he claims but was emotionally too close to the  case to be objective as his wife is an employee of TWA and he knew members  of the flight crew that perished.  The second thing I would say is that his  thesis that the Navy removed from the scene the remains of the missile and  those pieces of the TWA plane that had the tell-tale reddish-orange traces  of missile propellant is not logical as he proposes that this was done  under cover of darkness during the first night after the crash.  Is it  logal to think that Navy divers would be able to sort out the necessary  pieces of metal under water in the dark? I think not.  The third thing I  would say is that the Clinton Administration has enough  &quot;cover-ups&quot; and out-right lies to its credit to make believable  the premise that the beauracracy was trying to hide something.  I don't  recommend the book.	1999-12-06

It is a first person account written as the events were unfolding.  It's too bad that it stops at the end of 1941, as I would like to know what happened  next and I am waiting for the next volume.  Klemperer's knowledge of the  literature of the French Revolution and the comparisons he frequently draws  between France of the French Revolution and Germany of the Nazi Era made me  want to do some studies of that time period as well.

After having to read in high school (in the 1970s) both Animal Farm and 1984, I confess that I approached this book with some trepidation. However, Orwell's descriptions of life as a coal  miner and his honest thoughts about Socialism, both in defense and in  criticism, make me wonder why the English teachers of the early 1970s  didn't have us read this book instead.  It is much better written and more  honest.	1999-10-17

This book was very good and was well-researched and written in an enjoyable style.  I enjoyed reading it.  However, I do not agree with some of the author's conclusions.  For example, the author states that Richard  P. Robinson was a &quot;text book example of a psychopathic killer.&quot;  Not according to what I've read about psychopaths.  This man, after being  found innocent by a jury of his peers (and, by the way, peers means equals,  so the jury SHOULD have been made of young males clerks to be a true jury  of his peers), went to Texas to escape the continued publicity surrounding  the case.  If he had been a &quot;text book example of a psychopathic  killer,&quot; he would have killed again or been in trouble with the law  over other murders.  Even the author admits that he was not.  That he was  obcessed with the murder does not mean he was the killer.  I would have  enjoyed seeing more information about the &quot;other Frank Rivers&quot;  and his life before, during, and after the trial.  Perhaps there is more to  him than meets the eye and the author, like all others before her, has  missed the obvious clues.	1999-08-15
US	52435894	R28RGLFT55UORP	0679723161	636015448	Lolita	Books	3	0	2	N	Y	Poetical	I must confess that I am quite undecided as to whether or not I liked this book.  The writing style is excellent, with much in a poetic and lyrical style that tickles the eyes and the imaginative senses.  There are few  writers that can achieve the magical flow of words and give the reader  mental pictures of what is being seen, heard, or experienced by the  characters.  The character of Humbert Humbert is very real and very human  -- and the character of Lolita is actually that of a very lovable child.  On the down side, however, is the subject matter.  To be sexually obcessed  with children is an illness and a crime, certainly not a trait that should  be given to the hero of a novel.  Even though the author continually states  that the obcession is wrong, Humbert Humbert is such a realistic person  that he still comes across as a heroic character.  Hence, as I am  undecided, I give it a rating of 3 for average, even though the writing  style is a 5 plus.	1999-08-02

This was a well-written and well-researched report of what happened at Ruby Ridge and it explained how the government failed in its duties to protect and serve.  Had it not been so tragic -- a pre-teenage boy killed  by U. S. Marshalls, a mother with her baby in her arms killed by an FBI  sniper, a U. S. Marshall also killed -- one might refer to this incident as  a comedy of errors.  Jess Walter was fair to all sides and expressed the  frustration felt by the Marshall whose duty it was to bring Randy Weaver in  but who felt his hands were tied until the whole situation overwhelmed him  and his team.	1999-07-26

As a person that doesn't read much romance, I got this book for pure escapism and found myself much intrigued.  First, there were the ghostly, stereotypically Jewish mother matchmakers who might have made the book all  by themselves had it not been for the novelty of the hero being an amputee.  I don't believe I've EVER read a book where the romantic interest was an  amputee.  I was very impressed that Sara Jarrod would break the physical  handicapped barrier by making it so.

This book is well-researched and contains information that everyone and their brother and sister should read.  This man knows Yugoslavia, knows the history of the country, and demonstrates that the  world had done nothing toward solving the &quot;nationalities&quot; problem  after the fall of Nazi Germany, when a reconciliation was possible.  The  author demonstrates how the world stood by and allowed the Ustasha to  highjack planes, to blow them up in mid-air, to run rampant with their  terrorist ideals while the Communists were in power, even going so far as  to give them the places to train their terrorist soldiers.  While the  author condemns Tito for not confronting the problem in Yugoslavia and  dealing with it while he was in power, the author also condemns the rest of  the world for their complicity to the crime.	1999-07-11

I loved the use of modern idioms by the translator as that gave a certain ease to the reading.

The truth seems to be  that this area of the world is and always has been a tinderbox and a bone  over which dogs will fight.  Perhaps the solution would be for the U.N. to  move EVERYONE out of the area and turn it into an International Park for  which one must pay and submit to a body search before entering.  Only,  since one of the historical bones of contention for the Albanians is their  right to bear arms, I have to ask why the Clinton administration is  supporting them.	1999-06-03

This book is about how the Communists came to power in Albania -- with a few mentions of Yugoslavia -- after World War II.  Unfortunately, the author repeats himself too much so that the reader gets the impression that  he could have made his point in a quarter the number of pages.  I am sure  the book is well researched; however, the author seems to have a bone to  pick with the political spectrum in general while evidently siding with the  Communist doctrine over any other.  Had I not been using the book for  research purposes myself, I don't think I would have finished it.	1999-05-25

However, from the layman's stand-point, I thought it was a little too intense.  There were sections that I had to go  back and reread several times in order to understand what the authors were  trying to say. I think this was because I am a layman with only General  Psych 101 as a background.  I can not, however, speak as to its rating for  a professional.	1999-05-19

It also goes deeply into the decades before Rodrigo became  Pope Alexander IV, during the reign of his uncle Pope Calixtus III.

As the book was written in the 1940s, some of  the information is &quot;behind the times&quot; in that more recent  Biblical scholars have found some information that leads to the conclusion  that Jesus was indeed a Pharisaic rabbi in his teachings and that it was  Paul and later followers of the teachings of Paul that turned his teachings  around to being the anti-Semitic literature the New Testament is today.

This book explains what Jesus meant when he said, &quot;In my Father's house are many  mansions.&quot;  It also explains what Paul meant by &quot;seeing through a  glass darkly.&quot;  Since there is no doubt that both Jesus and Paul were  Jewish mystics, it makes sense that explanations for their teachings can be  found in Kabbalah!

As it is short and quick  reading, it gives the basics of the Rottweiler's psychology and habits for  those in need of quick reference.  I recommend it for those not yet  Rottweiler owners and those who became Rottweiler owners unexpectedly.	1999-01-22

Clinton has some pretty tough charges  to answer once Congress gets its mind off sex and partisanship.	1998-11-27

The author follows the lives of six people from what they were doing that morning before the bomb exploded through their immediate  reactions and the following year.  In the final chapter, he offers a view  into their lives forty years later.  It portrays the horror of the event  from individual's eyes rather than the massive horror of nameless victims.  It should be recommended reading for high school history classes.	1998-11-20

I disagree!  This pair of diaries proves that teenage foolishness did NOT begin in the mid-20th  century!  This woman married at 14 to a man who was obviously disapproved  by her family and friends; forced him to leave her; did not obtain a  divorce; married as a bigamist to a man who was also a bigamist; left him  to be &quot;kept&quot; by a married man whose moral credentials one has no  choice but to doubt -- and, the editor would like us to believe that these  choices were &quot;forced on her&quot;?!  I think not!  There is nothing  that indicates that her first marriage was &quot;forced on her&quot; -- and  that is the starting point of all the rest of her troubles.  No sympathy  here.	1998-11-19

The author did his research well.  It is a good explanation of the Margaret Eaton Affair and of the social mores that women were expected to live by in the 1820s and  1830s.  It is also a classic example of the theory that &quot;men get their  identity by what they do; women, by their family.&quot;  Margaret Eaton  could not escape that she was the daughter of a &quot;tavern-keeper&quot;  and many of the slanders against her were merely based on the prejudices of  the time concerning the stereotypical behavior of the daughters of  tavern-keepers.	1998-10-30

Queen Victoria comes across as a strong-willed only child with a background  of child-abuse.  However, one can sympathize with her struggles to overcome  that.  Also one is left wondering if perhaps she was also a sufferer of  today's more common malady -- Bipolar Personality Disorder.  The book was  quite a good read and written more for the recreational reader than the  academic reader, which is always a good change of pace for an historian.	1998-10-26

While I may not be in agreement  with everything he says, he says it with style.  I especially enjoyed his  play on the old saying about power making corrupt in his description of  Pharoah at the time of Moshe.  His style is not that of the standard  historian but he puts things in a more relaxed phraseology, which makes for  entertaining reading.	1998-10-26

While this is  not usual fare for women, they should read this book!  It is excellently  well-written and exciting.  Any woman that enjoys Regency Romance will find  this book a welcome change of pace.  On the other hand, men who enjoy the  sea and war stories will also enjoy this as there is a good deal of action  and adventure and sea-faring terminology.  I am recommending it to my  husband, who is retired US Navy.  I believe this to be a book written for  anyone that enjoys a good tale.	1998-10-23

The author takes the history of London from  the days of the Roman Conquest to the present by fictionalizing it through  the eyes of four or five families.  Each historical era is presented as  part of the continuing saga of these families.  The only trouble I had was  that the books jumps from one century to another, which necessitates  turning to the &quot;family tree&quot; at the beginning of the book in  order to keep track of the characters.  It was, however, a good book.	1998-10-18

It is the journey of a  militant black of the Civil Rights Movement from his stand as a militant  black through the events that changed his life and his thoughts until he  became Jewish.  It is an incredible statement, showing how one person can  go one direction while those with whom he had previously identified go in  the exact opposite -- for while the author converted to Judaism, those  blacks with whom he identified in the Civil Rights Movement became  anti-Semitic to the point that the author actually fears them.	1998-09-25

Excellent and well-worth the read.	1998-09-20

However, if you are a lay person or  an historian looking for meat to put on the bare bones of method, this book  will be quite the disappointment.  Perhaps my low rating is due to my  expectations based on the book's title.  I suggest that Mr. Crossan should  have subtitled the book &quot;The Method of Discovering What Happened in  the Years Immediately After the Execution of Jesus.&quot;	1998-09-16

I admired the lengths to which the author went to research his family and the slaves that they had held.  He also did well in placing the events of his family into their historical context and setting so that the reader could easily see how everything fit together as to whether the Balls were typical of their time period or not. There is a lot of good information here for a student of history as well as for someone researching their only family and in need of a few pointers. Job well done.	1998-07-23
