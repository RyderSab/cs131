I've reread it about twice and love all of the characters, the plot, and the excellent surprise ending.  Hearing that the  remainder of the Ender's Game books weren't as good as the first, I didn't  bother with them; however, when I found that Orson Scott Card was writing  another version of the first book from Bean's point of view, I just had to  read it.  I recommend this book, just like the original, to ANYONE.  Card  has created a marvelously imaginative, realistic world of alliances, future  science, wars and relationships.  The characters, more than the technology,  drive this story.  I salute him for creating a work of such resounding  power.  <br />However, I do have a few little critiques of the book, though  they are not big enough to detract a star.  Bean in the original story is  painted as more naive and, though a very tiny bit of that remains, some of  the real magic that made Bean's character likable (i.e. his naivete) is  lost in this rewrite.  Also, the subplot involving Bean's nun caretaker  could have been made a bit shorter, though it is as engaging as the  Peter/Valentine subplot in the original.  Another thing: the co-incidence  between Bean and his best friend is a bit contrived, and the ending is  tidy.  Again, these are nit-picky little things, and not big problems.   This book should be read by any fans of the original work or mere casual  observers.  A warning to those who are new to this series:  READ ENDER'S  GAME FIRST!  This book is a companion and should NOT be taken on its own  two feet, though it could be.  Check it (and Ender's Game) out, and enjoy!	2000-05-01

I cannot stress that enough.  Don't let the fact that it is science fiction (and high-concept sci-fi at that) disuade you.  Don't let the fact that it looks pretty thick fool you.  And don't let the fact that it is about kids  make you pass it by.  This book, since I first read it four years ago, has  become my favorite book of all time.  It is brilliantly written, superbly  concieved, and possesses an ending that is one of the greatest surprises  presented in any medium.  This book is the work of a genius.  A friend of  mine summarized it in this way:  Lord of the Flies in a controlled  environment.  Though that is not entirely accurate (there's a great deal  more to the story), that's a start.  Check it out (PLEASE!) and enjoy!  You  won't be sorry.	2000-05-01

Howard's work, from Conan of Cimmeria to Solomon Kane.  I started collecting the 1970's Conan paperbacks (by REH, Bjorn Nyberg, L. Sprague De Camp, and Lin Carter) a little while back, and have almost completed my collection.  Not only Conan catches, my interest,  though, and I'm interested in REH's other characters as well (did you know  he used to write WESTERNS?  It's true.).  Thus, when I found the newer  published editions of his works, I decided to buy his Kull compilation.   Kull is an excellent book, combining a great many of Howard's antediluvian  tales which take place before the Hyborean Age of Conan.  Kull is more of a  contemplative character than Conan, more...moral, I suppose one could say,  more brooding, where Conan is more of a James Bond with a sword, which is  part of his appeal.  Kull, however, IS prone to outbursts, fond of intrigue  and, of course, no prude when it comes to battle, and all are combined in  equal amounts to make an excellent read.  I actually prefer the Kull  stories to the Conan stories in terms of characterization and plot, though  the Conan stories are a gret deal more varied in their concepts and more  action-packed.  However, if you read this book, don't just stop here.   There's a wealth of literature by REH out there just begging to be read.   Check it out and enjoy!	2000-04-30
US	52189853	R18M0UOQR8NXYY	038549081X	709722953	The Handmaid's Tale	Books	5	11	14	N	N	A Brilliantly Original Dystopian Tale	I literally finished this book minutes ago, and I must say that I enjoyed it.  This is the second book of Atwood's that I have read (Cat's Eye being the first) and I believe that The Handmaid's Tale is the better of the two.   On the cover of my edition, the book was compared to Orwell's brilliant  1984, and I suppose that it could be considered its counterpart.  However,  where Orwell was attempting to make a devastatingly profound point about  government and its influence, Atwood's work takes on the nature of human  instincts.  Both books have immense resonance for the reader, and Atwood  paints an excellent picture of a pseudo-religious, paramilitary junta  government and its social restraints.  The ending is very well done and  leaves the book rather open-ended, something I usually decry, but it works  well in this literary masterpiece.  The ending itself will remain a mystery  to even the most analytical reader. The appendix at the back of the book is  quite, if casually, infomative, though there should have been more than one  to fully explain the nature and conjuration of the Gilead government.  A  book definately worth the reader's time and a fine, fast, fantastic read.   Check it out, and enjoy!	2000-04-30

I've always been a fan of ancient  history and mythology and since I had heard little about the events on  which this work was based I decided to pick the book up.  There are only  two words that can truly capture my reaction:  BLOWN AWAY.  The book's art  is composed in a Miller's trademark gritty-poetic style, and Lynn Varley's  colors add true, muted life to the pencilwork.  The characters, though  there are very few that the readers get to know, are shown to be not just  characters but human beings and treated with respect.  The plot itself is a  little over-used (from the first page the reader can glean how it ends),  but since it is true to life and true to the characters it packs a wollop.   The ending itself is reminiscient of Braveheart, and exceptionally well  done.  The battle scenes are intense, and the dialogue and inner monologues  held by the main character, Leonidas, are some of the best tough-guy lines  I've seen in any movie or read in any book.  If you like such films as John  Wayne's The Alamo, Braveheart or Spartacus, if you are a true comic fan or  are interested in ancient history (or perhaps all of these things) pick up  300.  You won't be disappointed.  Check it out and enjoy!	2000-04-28

Not only is the prospect of having all of the great Marvel heroes  battle it out against a madman of a cosmic being, but it is also  interesting to see the Marvel definition of the Universe.  Many characters  are present in this book that represent the various ideas of philosophy and  metaphisics.  Love,Hate, Eternity, the Celestials, the Great Tribunal,  Galactus, Mephisto and more all are present for the great climactic battle.   Marvel's riveting representations of philosophical and spiritual ideas  seem to create its own mythology, with these &quot;rulers of the  omniverse&quot; as the gods and the pantheon of superheroes as, well, the  heroes. Not only are the ideas and interpretations held within this volume  interesting, but the plot and characters (and their respective reactions to  each other and their situation) make for a masterpiece of comic book  literature.  Oh, and the ending and the epilogue are superbly crafted and  just a little bit funny.  Definately a great read.  Check it out, and  enjoy!	2000-04-08

I found myself truly caring about the characters and literally on  the edge of my seat several times just waiting to turn the page.  Overall,  the book was a great success with me, but I have one small bone to pick  that keeps this book from earning a 5-Star rating: the ending.  By this I  do not mean the final ending of the book, but the ending of John Coffey's  portion of the book.  It is simplistic, amatuerish, and tidy, not the kind  of ending I would expect from a writer of King's renown and readership.  It  feels to me that he was running out of ideas in a book that is full of  innovation, and the ending left a hollow place in my stomach.  However,  despite this pitfall, the book is definately worth the reader's time and is  one of the better books that I have read this year.  Check it out, and  enjoy!	2000-03-25

However, I saw the movie first.  I loved the movie,  the characters, the concepts, etc.  It was my favorite movie and still  holds my cinemtic respect.  The book takes a less-lighthearted, darker and  more pessimistic approach than the movie and ends in a hurried, rather  disappointing manner.  Probably, had I read the book first I would have  thought differently.  For those who are fantasy enthusiasts looking to read  a book that travels the road not taken, The Princess Bride is for you.  For  those who are die-hard fans of the exceptional film, beware: It's not what  you'd expect.	2000-03-25
US	52189853	RTU4SEE69XZ4K	0451199669	849860918	The Blair Witch Project	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Better Than The Movie	When I first heard that The Blair Witch Project had a &quot;dossier&quot; coming out for it, I thought it would be rather dull.  Then I started to become interested in the ideas and the hype presented by the hit film, and decided to get the book to see just what the heck the writers and directors  had in mind.  Apparently they had a lot in mind.  This book, written in a  sort of epistelary form (completely created from &quot;letters,&quot;  &quot;transcripts,&quot; etc.) follows the fictitious search by the  authroities after the events presented in the movie.  Though the entire  Blair Witch phenomenon was just a plot dreamed up by two independent  filmmakers, they went a long way to compile a mythology.  Many of the more  incomprehensible things in the film are explained in detail, and there's a  lot of background information on any number of things in the film that were  mentioned and not fully looked into.  Towards the end the book does  degenerate into a literary arm of the film which does not work with the  remainder of the work.  However, this is still spookier to read than the  movie is to watch, though the film will keep you up for about a week.  I  loved the &quot;woodcut illustrations,&quot; the &quot;real life&quot;  photos, etc.  The writer of this book went a long way to make this seem  realistic, and I think he did an excellent job.  This book works well in  tandem with the Sci-Fi Channel's Blair Witch &quot;documentary&quot; Curse  of the Blair Witch, which I believe is available on videocassette.  A book  definately worth the price of admission, and certainly NOT a mere  novelization.  Check it out, and enjoy!	2000-03-19

Then, one day I came upon a first edition of the novel at an  antique shop and bought it.  I read it quickly (the book travels at a  breakneck speed) and with much relish, and when I was done I was satisfied.   The movie was good, but the novel was BETTER.  Puzo's Corleone family is a   well-illustrated, clearly defined group, each member with his own  strengths and weaknesses.  The storytelling is gripping, the dialogue  brilliant, the characters charming.  Puzo, in addition to the main bent of  the story, delves into the shady side of old-school Hollywood and makes an  interesting read of it.  For any lover of the Godfather saga, this book is  a must read.  Check it out, and enjoy!	2000-03-19

Though I have not read any of those compilations, they can hardly be better than The Dark Knight Returns.  Here is a work (along with Alan Moore's Watchmen) that truly proves that comic books are a legitimate  literary medium.  The Dark Night Returns on the surface is a story of an  aging Bruce Wayne who realizes that his true destiny is to be the Batman,  and subsequently comes out of retirement.  Beneath this narrative, however,  is a tale (less a tale than a commentary) on the state of our society.   Miller's artwork is subtle and mercurial.  In some panels his artistry  cannot be matched even by the likes of Frazetta, and in others his art is  simplistic and even messy, a genius stroke to convey slight, difficult  changes in mood and scene.  His evenly-spaced panels, his  &quot;overuse&quot; of television-like segments, all point to a post-modern  masterpiece of literature and a deep understanding of the comic medium's  power.  Comics are a most potent combination of television and literature  that hits the reader with a one-two punch of reality and fantasy.  The  book's symbolism is subtle, yet obvious, a difficult thing to evoke in your  standard comic.  This work MUST be read at least twice, as there are a  great deal of instances in dialogue, etc.  that are lost on the reader the  first time through.  Comments made by reporters or bystanders or merely in  narration boxes that seen insignificant and throwaway are often powerful  vehicles for metaphor, symbolism, and foreshadowing and must be paid  attention to to get the whole picture.  I would rank this book among the  greatest comic stories ever told, along with: the continuing saga of Blade  of the Immortal by Hiroaki Samura; the aforementioned Watchmen by Alan  Moore; Marvels and Kingdom Come, both masterfully illustrated by Alex Ross;  and, for the light-action seeker, Battle Chasers: A Gathering of Heroes by  Joe Madureira.Check it out and enjoy!	2000-03-19

I absolutely  loved his dry, fast, &quot;masculine&quot; prose and careful character  description.  I could feel for these characters, their niavete and sorrow  and grief and urge to be happy and ultimate failure almost palpable.  One  of the more lighthearted portions of the book, however, finds the main  character and his best friend going fly-fishing in a French stream.  This  seemed (and I cannot quite place why) remiscient of For Whom the Bell Tolls  in its general construction.  In all, an excellent book, on par with  Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.

This book, too, centers on a mysterious murder perpetrated in a kindly community.  However, there are  several notable differences, the most striking being that while Midnight  gets into more of the deep-seated intrigues present in Savannah, In Cold  Blood centers on the psyches of the killers themselves, and the tireless  investigation to catch them.  Little local color is really included, and  that which is seems quite out-of-place, dull and sedentary, the book's only  downfall.  The Clutter Family is clearly, cleanly portrayed, and though the  outcome of the work is never in doubt, Capote makes a marvelous showing by  giving the reader a solemn roller-coaster as the authorities chase the  blindly-running criminals.  This is an excellent book, and I would  certainly recommend that any reader interested look into both this book and  Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Check 'em out and enjoy!	2000-03-17

His blend of soft prose, engaging dialogue and  real-life  characters and experiences draws the reader into a world where  anything is possible.  Though the story is excellent, the true virtue of  this book is the loving, intricate, powerful depiction of Savannah itself  and the many unique characters that inhabit it.  Many interesting facts  about Savannah come to the surface, and many other facts that one wouldn't  ordinarily know about (for instance, the Johnny Mercer House, around which  much of the story revolves, was used as one of the settings in the film  Glory).  Berendt knows this city, knows its people, and his loving touch  and style brings out the truth of Savannah.  A book definately worth the  price of admission.  Please Check it out.

For those readers who may dismiss this book as a mere novelization of the action movie, please read on.  This book was written in 1959 and is NOTHING like the movie.  For me, it is one of the best novels that I have ever read  in any genre.  Starship Troopers tells the tale of a young man who decides  to join earth's marine fighting force against a variety of alien enemies.  However, the book spends little time actually in action scenes describing  the various conflicts.  Much of the book is all about the boot-camp of the  future, the rigorous training that the men go through and the psychological  state of not just the recruits but also of their commanders.  This is a  beautiful book, rooted in the  American military traditions of World War  II.  It exudes the concepts of honor and courage in a poetic, easy-to-read  manner.  It discusses military and societal theory in such a way that the  reader does not get bored, and much of the political commentary is  interesting and insightful.  The book is sophisticated in its critiques of  modern society and of its view of the military and its place in society.  It truly is infinitely more than the movie made it out to be.  Heinlein has  written a masterpiece that can live through the ages.  Definately an great  and entertaining read and a must for any sci-fi fan or military history  buff.

This is one of the most entertaining, informative, well- researched, well-written books that I have ever read.  Do not, however, be fooled by that fact that this is a graphic novel.  Just as Art Spiegleman's Maus (another great historical graphic novel) is a work of historical and  literary merit, so too is Wilderness.  Drawn, written and researched by the  great Timothy Truman (famous for his work on DC Comics' Jonah Hex series)  this book is effortlessly engaging and truly educational.  A better, more  focused retelling of the life of the &quot;outlaw&quot; and  &quot;traitor&quot; Simon Girty, (a spy and Indian Agent for the British  during the American Revolution and for a long time after) than even the  landmark touchstone text History of the Girties, the book delves subtly,  solidly into the psyche of Girty and the mindset of his times.  This book  is an excellent companion piece to Allan W. Eckertt's The Frontiersmen and  That Dark and Bloody River.  This is a quick-reading must-have for anyone  interested in the men and women that shaped the early history of the  American frontier.  Enjoy!	2000-03-11

I was first impressed by Atwood's innovative description.  Her eye and ear for detail has a mystical ability to speak to the reader's own thoughts and perceptions about everyday things.   The  book's heroine, Elaine Risley, takes us through the journey of her life,  from elementary school to middle-age, detailing the trials and tribulations  along the way.  The story switches between Elaine's formative years and her  grown-up self, and adds interesting, provocative breaks in the action that  keep the reader interested.  The book has a strange, misty, ethereal  quality, as though the narrator is walking in a dream while recounting her  youthful experiences, and this adds a sinister bent to the often-gritty  tale.  Although not an uplifting tome, Cat's Eye has a Forrest Gump-ish  quality in that Elaine Risley is our guide through Canada from the end of  World War II to the mid-80s, noting all of the world's changes in the  backdrop of Elaine's life.  Masterfully told, and an excellent read.   Enjoy!	2000-03-11

This book made the entire experience of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (nearing it's 200th anniversary) come alive from the page. The tome is  packed with excellent facts and background not only about the two  adventurers themselves, but also about their aides, equipment, food and  supplies, and the Indian cultures that they encountered. However, the book  is, as a great many well-researched texts are, dry in many places and a  good deal lengthier that it needs to be.  In all, however, it paints a  wholly accurate portrait of the great deeds and harrowing adventures that  Lewis and Clark encountered, and their lives afterward.	2000-03-11

This wonderful book started me on my way to being the lover of ancient Egyptian culture and mythology that I am  today.  Though written for a very young audience, its very straightforward  approach doesn't pull any punches.  The mummification process is described  in fascinating detail, and there are beautiful illustrations accompanying  every page.  There are even drawings of those Egytpian gods important to  the mummification process.  One of my favorite books of all time, it is a  treasure-trove of knowedge about Egytpian culture.

Saramago's concept of a world caught up in a disease of blindness was a brilliant one, but his accomplishments in making this event seem plausible are superior.   The book's entire structure adds to the blind quality of the novel:  The  characters are unnamed, save for a vague moniker that breifly describes  them (example:  the girl with dark glasses, the old man with the black eye  patch).  The dialogue is unquoted and placed within the text, virtually  unmarked.  Chapters are unnamed,  and the text is written in large, lengthy  paragraphs, mimicking the fact that sensations would come with no breaks,  that all would seem as one. The book's only downfall is its occasional  difficulty.  Though the prose is simply, elegantly written in a somewhat  sparse style, its blocky format can be too much for some readers to handle  at a time.  As well, the unquoted, often unattributed dialogue can become  confusing after a lengthy passage of conversation, as the reader is unable  to tell who is speaking. Besides these minor pitfalls, this book truly  resembles a modern retelling of many mythological stories, but with a  tragically human bent that draws the readers in and makes them feel a part  of the action.  An excellent, thought-provoking read, worthy of any  bibliophile's library.  Enjoy.	2000-03-10

Contained within this volume (and it's companion expansion [buy both!]) is a trove of Simpson's trivia that  will keep you busy.  I love to quote this show immensely and engage my  friends in trivia contests quite often, and this book really revved up my  knowledge.   A few minor things, however, keep this book from a 5-Star  rating.

Presented are many of his seminal paintings, each one a testament to Vallejo's artistic talent.   Vallejo's care and artistry in rendering the realistic human figure is  unparalleled, and this could be used as not only a pure art book, but also  as an art anatomy tome.  Little about the human body escapes Vallejo's  artist's eye, and his figures are well-muscled, fierce, yet human and  supple.  The varied amounts of light, shading, color, composition and  creativity in this book is astounding and worthy of any collection of  fantasy art.  Those interested in Vallejo's art should look into his most  recent collection, Dreams, as well.  In closing, this book is a good  teaching tool to those who are in a more advanced skill level, but also  good for beginners looking for how to view poses, composition, color, and  basic anatomy.  Enjoy!	2000-03-10

The two creators of this series are to be  congratulated.  Their blend of Detective Comics and The Godfather films  (there are sly references to Mario Puzo's and Francis Ford Coppola'a  cinematic masterpieces) brings an entirely new dimension to the world of  The Dark Knight.  Any fans of Batman or merely film noir will be pleasantly  surprised at this superb retelling of Harvey Dent (Two Face)'s fall from  Gotham City District Attorney to psychopathic criminal.  This is an  excellent tale, on par with Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan  Moore's Watchmen.  A must-have for any Batman or comic book fan.  Check it  out, and Enjoy!	2000-03-10

As a mythology enthusiast and a fan of mythical monsters from all over the world, this book captured my imagination.   Excellently illustrated by a number of talented artists, the book gives  descriptions both in D&amp;D numerical terms and layman's descriptions.   Anyone looking for an end-all/be-all of mythological knowledge should be  warned, however, that this tome does alter certain aspect of the mythical  monsters for purposes of the game, and some of the creatures presented  herein are entirely created by TSR.  An interesting read and a great source  of information.  Enjoy!	2000-03-09

A writer and fan of folklore and mythology, I am constantly on the prowl for  information to add realism to my stories. The Vampire Encyclopedia is an  excellent wellspring of information. Not only covering the traditional  vampire conventions, the work looks into the vampires of many other  cultures, including those of Asia, Africa and, of course, Europe.  There  are notes on vampire movies, books, short stories, plays.  Extensive lists  are present on all manner of vampire lore.  A fantastic resource.   Extensively researched and well laid-out.  Bravo!	2000-03-09

It is a difficult thing to discover a book on drawing that will coddle the casual (or serious) student without rushing or confusing him with complicated theory or diagrams.  I received this book as a gift and soon fell in love with it.  It is an easy, step-by-step guide to drawing the  human figure that puts emphasis on the two most important aspects of  drawing: observation and practice.  The diagrams are easy to discern and  the text leaves nothing to chance.   Though the early parts of the book  state that it is meant to be drawn in, I would not recommend it.  The book  is much better used as a textbook than a playground, although younger  artists will find this &quot;drawable&quot; feature to their liking.   If  in the past books based solely on one company's characters have seemed  unimaginative and merely promotional, this book will shatter all  preconceptions.  Add into the bargain that it includes a pencil and  markers, and you're all set.  A definite must have!	2000-03-03

I did not have to wait long.  LEGEND is leaps and bounds ahead of ICON (although  both books are essential for any collection of Frazetta's works), both in  biographical works and selection of paintings.  While ICON concentrated  mostly on his &quot;fantasy-based&quot; paintings (largely the magnificient  pieces that Frazetta created for the Robert E. Howard series), LEGEND  concentrates on the &quot;fantasy-based&quot; paintings Frazetta painted  both for Howard and Burroughs, as well as much-appreciated comic work and  book covers from other genres of literature.  A perfect companion piece to  ICON or any other fantasy or Frazetta collection.	2000-03-03

For many a day I despaired that I would never find a good anatomy book to help my comic book aspirations along, and finally I found  it.  Though His instruction often takes the form of difficult, intricately  drawn models created almost mathematically (and this difficulty garners the  4-Star rating), the overall glimpses of the human form (especially the  arms, legs, chest and back) and the anatomical detail make this book a true  must-have for any aspiring artist in any field.	2000-02-28

The art is spectacular, the plot and charaters inventive, and the overall feel of  the work is one of a kind of nervous ease.  Well worked! As a big fan of  the samurai, I automatically wished to pick up this manga and read it.   Though it is gratuitously bloody (hench only a 4-star rating), the entire  sage is ultimately entertaining and worthy of being named right along with  Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell.  Don't just stop at one volume.  The  story is very complex and keeps interweaving itself throughout.  I can't  wait for part V!	2000-02-27

This is the second good book that I bought concerning drawing (I bought it a few years ago when I first renewed my interest in drawing).   Though a little on the scattered side (it includes a little on everything!)  this book is great for beginners and those artists who want to polish their  art with a little bit of added nuance and panache.  Check out his How To  Draw Comic Book Bad Guys and Gals as well (These books go in tandem).   Happy reading!	2000-02-27

His characters, battle scenes and backgrounds reflect a very Americanized adaptation of the classic Manga style of Japan.  The fantasy elements in  the book are well-woven (I especially enjoy the crotchety Gnolan and his  war-golem, Calibretto), and the settings and characters brim with a  cartoony realism.  He, along with peers J. Scott Campbell and Jim Lee form  the hub of standard for art in the comics world today.  This is a work not  to be missed. NOTE: This collection includes issues 1-5 of Battle Chasers'  run, and features a gallery of character art at the back drawn by Maduriera  and other talented artists.	2000-02-27

'Nuff said!  His characters are a mix of fantasy and superhero convention, with a dash of Dungeons and Dragons and a good helping of Final Fantasy.  There's something for  everybody in this book, which includes the first five issues of Battle  Chaser's run.  Any fantasy fan will love it, and any comic book fan will  love it too.  I'm from both camps and I find the book exceptionally  satisfying.  There's an intro writted by the Mad man himself, alsong with a  gallery of character drawings by Maduriera and others.  Pick this one up.   You won't be disappointed.	2000-02-27

This book, however, mostly deals not with the human body per se, but with the nuances  involved in creating the comic book superheroine.  A knowledge of basic  human anatomy would be most helpful in dealing with this book. There are,  however, some extremely helpful sections dealing with posing, proportions,  using computers in drawing, the different inking and coloring techniques,  and differing ways to draw faces, hair and (the bane of many a neophyte  artist) the hands.  Overall, an excellent work with only a few minor flaws.   Check it out!	2000-02-27
