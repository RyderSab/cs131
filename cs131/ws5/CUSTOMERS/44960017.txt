US	44960017	RFIEZING986XK	1400062314	9571448	Prep: A Novel	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Starts out good, but ends sour.	The first half of this book was so good, that I was dismayed when I finished the other half. The author established Lee as a typical unsure-of-herself teenager settling in at a posh boarding school on the East Coast. She was afraid of being, as a scholarship student, shunned. I found myself relating to many of the things that Lee had to deal with, at least for the most part. However, as the novel progressed, I began to lose empathy for Lee. She turned shallow and seemed to have an anti-social disorder. Towards the very end, certain acts of hers led me to see her as a complete pushover. The author may have been trying to portray Lee as a typical teenager. I as a teenager, seemed utterly confused by Lee's bizarre behaviors. She never wanted to get involved with anything, and she wanted to be miserable all the time; yet, she still expected people to like her.  In addition to this, all the characters and teachers at the school seemed so superficial, like they all had personality disorders. If this is what expensive boarding schools are really like, then thank goodness for public education.	2005-06-13

I was wrong; The Bonesetter's Daughter was a thorough and very enticing read. The book chronicled the lives of two people- Ruth and her mother, Lu Ling. The two had a shaky relationship ever since Ruth was a little girl. After discovering many aspects about LuLing's life, the reader gains a more clear knowledge of LuLing's behaviour and understands how she acts with Ruth. The story was very touching, with many sad things happening to both characters. This story, like Joy Luck Club, offers much insight into Chinese cultures and customs; it also shows the loss of identity that comes along with trying to adopt an American identity on top of another culture.	2005-03-12

The story starts out in the 80's, and the heroines live in an old-fashioned, tradition-following home in India. There are no men in the household, save the servants, as Sudha and Anju's fathers both disappeared years ago. As the two grow older, Sudha learns of a dark, family secret that taints almost every major decision she makes. After a cruel twist of fate one evening, Sudha lets go the idea of going to college and Anju, who has big dreams of going to college and managing her mother's bookstore, suffers a plight as well just soon after Sudha. Though this book did have one very unlikely line in the plot, it kept me captivated and the language was very beautiful.	2004-07-22

I was thorougly surprised! The stories had so much depth, emotion, and symbolism strewed about. Ranging from immigrants from South Asia, to young women in South Asia, the novel was full of strong characters. I found I could sympathize with the story of a young girl who became acquainted with a Bengali man whose family was still in Bangladesh (back when it was still part of Pakistan) the most. That story, &quot;When Mr. Pirzada Came to Dine,&quot; was definitely my favorite. One thing that I didn't like was how every story ended in a sad and unsure note. Some stories were utterly depressing and left a reader confused. Even with that flaw, Lahiri was able to convey South Asian culture in an amazing manner. So though it was a bit unrealistic with the melancholy mood lingering everywhere (South Asian culture isn't all that gloomy!), the novel presented excellent ideas and themes.	2004-05-29

From an evil mistress (who is eternally pregnant), a jealous coworker, children who like making trouble for Griet, and the butcher's son who has set his eyes on her, Griet's only consolations are from her Master, Vermeer, and his paintings. Chosen as an art apprentice, by the master himself, Griet strives for her master's attention. The master is a strange, distant man who spends most of his time in his art room preparing for a painting. As Vermeer has a good reputation, he tries to keep it by working for perfection at his paintings. When his reputation and his career are almost ruined by a request demeaning to Griet, the master calls upon Griet to make a decision that may get her booted out of the Vermeer household. --Though this novel certainly was captivating, many points were not explained properly, leaving a reader a bit confused. The most confusing of these points would probably have been those of Griet's emotions, and of the Master's decisions. So little is given of the Master's character, that a reader must make guesses for many of his decisions. Also, Griet's emotions were a bit strange, and also were not explained clearly. She seemed a bit distant throughout the novel, making her seem shallow. As a reader I didn't like her character very much because of that aspect.	2004-02-03

People who are uneducated and change the face of Islam make up the rules in these provinces. I wish that the author could have acknowledged the fact that a strewed picture of Islam was shown because of the way it was misused. Women aren't treated like meat in Islam, and not all of Pakistan has such old-style rules. It is only the rural areas as I mentioned; the areas where the majority of people are illiterate. As a female of Pakistani descent, it bothered me to read a review saying that 'the real islam' was shown. I hope this reaches the author and shows her how disturbing it is to all Pakistani Muslims when characters who don't know the real beliefs and teachings of Islam are called 'religious.' Thank you.	2004-01-06

While most girls her age are forced to sit around doing needlepoint, Nancy manages to perceive much more then the tedious life expected for her. Her father is wealthy, owning a sugar-cane plantation in Jamaica. Being as she is the youngest, and also the only girl in the household, Nancy is either bullied or ignored with a seldom loving remark from her siblings; all older boys.  Nancy's father is gone to Jamaica for a portion of the year as well as traveling the globe, and when he is at home, he treats Nancy like an afterthought, permitting her to seek her will. Nancy also has a childhood friend, William, who is a tar, and has consequently evolved into something greater then just a friend, though it is apparent that one day Nancy will be forced to marry someone against her will for the benefit of the family's wealth. With this depressing information told in flashback by Nancy, Nancy's true adventures really begin after her father's demise. As her father's will states, Nancy is sent to Jamaica to be in command of her own sugar-cane plantation, while her brothers receive greater and more immense wealths. It is when Nancy reaches Jamaica, that her innocence of the plantations is lost, as Nancy seeks sight to graphic and horrific views of slaves, and their treatment. Nancy also befriends a slave by the name of Minerva before meeting a malicious Brazilian courtier who hands Nancy a blood-red ruby necklace. On the return from her visit, Minerva and Nancy are met with a horrific situation that is solved with much bloodshed; from here the climax arises, and Minerva and Nancy explore the roguish and completely unfeminine life of pirates. <BR>      Though this story was interesting, I feel that it was about one-hundred pages too long, and the ending was cut off too abruptly. Other than those factors, the story was immensely absorbing, and the originality of the story's ideakept me captivated every moment until the end.	2003-10-23

After Maclennan returns from his trip to China, he expects his dungeon and castle fortress to be built. Why does Maclennan go to China in the 14th century so far away from Scotland? It did sound a bit unrealistic, but in the story it was said he wanted adventure. Well if that was what he was searching for, he found it. Only, it wasn't the only thing that he found. Along with silk bedsheets,(highly rare in Scotland)Maclennan bought a tea slave . He didn't bother to learn her name, and he figured she was just a slave. This girl's name is Peony, and she is frightened to death when she is taken away with Maclennan to Scotland. She is treated like dirt by Maclennan, and she will never get to see her family again. Peony is extremely obedient towards Maclennan, and sees to his every wish, even when he throws her blows. Throughout the story as a reader, you sympathize with Peony and become more and more confused with Maclennan, as to whether or not he cares for Peony more than just a slave, or as a daughter. Also you get to see Maclennan's crueller side as a person with hate pent up inside him. His thirst for revenge made him a completely abominable character with no heart.Toward his enemy, his ideas are without remorse. His dungeon will dwell with Macinnan, and he will rule the land. In the end, cruel twists relay the truth to Maclennan about every action he has made in his life. The reader will be shocked at the end of the story, and will be moved thoroughly.

It touched on an area that not many books usually discuss. It was about Chinese mothers and their American daughter's relationships. It was quite a moving story, and some of the mother's stories were quite woeful. The daughters all had hidden secrets from their mothers and the mothers vice versa. Each chapter was from the perspective of a different character who sat at the Joy Luck Club; a club where a group of women would sit, talk, and play mah jong. The daughters were to carry out the tradition.I found myself able to relate to some of the chapters with the daughters and it was such an alleviation to me that this matter had been struck with such accuracy. To me, this story was a quick relief because it pleased me to know that there was a book that touched on mother/daughter relationships in Asia.	2003-01-24

Rumor has it that she is the daughter of Zeus himself. She is called Helen of the flaxen hair and many suitors have died trying to marry her. The book starts out with Helen being \\"kidnapped\\" by Theosis of Athens. Though it is a kidnapping, Helen has a lot of fun on the journey to Theosis's home. This \\"kidnaping\\" is the first one to show Helen, who is growing up, how much she is worth. When she goes back to her home, she has to marry Prince Menelaus, who is a stocky red-haired man. A few years from then Helen has Menelaus's daughter and she is quite happy with her life until some visitors from Troy arrive. One of these visitors has a voice as smooth as honey and he looks as handsome as Helen is beautiful. His voice lures Helen and she finds herself running away with him back to Troy. Of course, Menelaus and the whole nation of Greece want their gem of a woman back, and will even start a war for her. This is how the Trojan War gets started. At this point Cassandra's story starts as well. Cassandra is much more stronger than Helen and has a gift -- or curse if you would like to call it. She can see permanitions and has visions of the future. This isn't good always because she, being a girl, has little regard in the men's business, and they won't listen to her speak of the permanitions she has seen. She has a brother named Helenus whom the men find more easy to believe. Both Cassandra and her brother Helenus have this curse and they try to make the best of it. However, sometimes no matter how hard they try the best just doesn't come out of the worst.	2003-01-01

All she has heard is good things about the Tsar, her mother respects and would never say a bad word about him or his family. Katya and her mother soon leave off to live in the Tsar's palace as Katya's mother is invited as a lady-in-waiting. At first Katya's life is tea-parties and gossip galore with all the Romanov daughters. Soon, however, Katya sees behind the palace walls, and begins to agree with Misha on his opinions of peasants. Throughout the book you see Katya's emotions and opinions on the real condition of everyone other then the nobles in Russia. Katya takes a big journey form noble to a farming peasant, and learns so much on the way. I liked this book very much because it actually told what happened in the rest of St. Petersburg and not just in the Romanov's  castle. If you liked this book you will definitely love Homeless Bird.	2002-10-29

The savages are caught and some are kept for sacrifice while the others are kept as slaves for the noblemen. Eveningstar met a savage boy in the jungle and named him Small. Evening Star's family took him in as a servant. Eveningstar's oldest brother, Smokeshell is met with much honor after the capturing of the savages for he helps capture them. When the old King Flint Sky god dies,the evil High Priest, Great Skull Zero is left to rule. Great Skull Zero does not want anyone to threaten his spot on the throne, so he calls out a list of men who will be thrown into the Well of Sacrifice. All of these men are noblemen, and are soldiers who are highly respected. Among the chosen men are Smokeshell and Feather Dawn's fiance.(Feather Dawn is Eveningstar's snotty and headstrong sister) Eveningstar quickly figures that Great Skull Zero is only having those soldiers killed for his own greed, and not for the Gods.

Her Uncle was cruel to all of his children, but most cruel to Nicola, for she was adopted into the perfomance crew. One day, at the most important event for the traveling crew, at the Palace in Rheims, where the crew was to entertain Queen Mary and King Francis, Nicola had a few run-ins with the Queen Mary herself. Queen Mary found Nicola witty and entertaining, so she bought her from Uncle as her own fool. For the first few months as fool, everything went perfect for Nicola, but the turning point was when King Francis died, and it was decided for Queen Mary to leave France and live in Scotland. From then on, the story became more and more depressing for the Queen and for Nicola, who was always behind the Queen. From the awful husband, Darnley, who was murdered, to the Queen's imprisonment...This book was true to history and was fun to read, but I don't think Queen Mary would have been such a kind soul.	2002-09-21

The story starts out with her at the age of 14 in 1627. She is the daughter of Khurram, and his favorite daughter for she was born to his favorite wife, Arjumand Banu Begum. Jahanara's brothers and sisters are Aurangzeb, Raushanara, and Dara. Aurangzeb is the most religious one who only talks about Islam. (I found that a bit unrealistic, no one only keeps one thing in their mind especially not if they are a prince) Dara was like Akbar and liked studying different cultures and religions. Raushanara sided with siblings, part of the story she was with Aurangzeb and his beliefs. Jahanara basically talks about her surroundings in the palace and the harem. One gripe I had in the book was that Jahanara kept downcasting Islam and comparing it to Hinduism. For example when she started eating snacks during Ramadan. That was a very immature thing for a fourteen year old girl to do, in Islam everyone humbles themself during Ramadan and they try to become better Muslims. It was a bit offensive when she said thing's like, \\"I really hate Ramadan.\\" She always seemed to say she liked the Hindu customs better than the Muslim ones and I feel that no good Muslim would do that. Other than that, the diary was well written!	2002-09-05

Young Princess Torina of Archeld, daughter of Queen Dreea and King Kareed, was one day offered a slave by her father. Not just any slave, the son of the King of Bellandra, whose father had been killed in war by King Kareed himself. Torina who knew very well that her father didn't keep slaves set him free the minute he was granted. The now set free slave (Landen) was sent to live in the barracks. Oh, but that's not all that King Kareed brought back with him after seizing the kingdom of Bellandra, he also brought back a gazing crystal ball for his daughter who at the time did not know she was a seer (one who can see into the future) During an archery tournament in which Landen won, Torina kept her crystal ball nearby. As she could see into the future, she was able to save him from a painful death(of which you will find the details later) Landen wanted to payback the kind girl and gave her archery lessons in secret. It ended once Torina turned twelve and a close watch was kept on her. The archery lessons between the two ceased and they never saw each other anymore. When Torina turned 15, three years later, she came to love Vesputo, a malicious and manipulative man who would do anything to achieve his cunning ends. Vesputo would butter up Torina with compliments and Torina had no idea that he was using her for the crown as King. Landen noticed the acts of Vesputo and noticed whenever Torina came out to greet the kingdom he would always stay up close to her, Landen, who knew of Vesputo's behaviour, warned Torina that Vesputo would kill her father, and Torina turned him away. There, that is where I'll leave you hanging. This is definitely the best fantasy fiction I have ever read. There were no flaws or anything, I understood every point and detail in the story, and I started reading the book at 11 at night fell asleep with it open at 2:30, woke up and finished it in the morning. It's one of those books that you just have to finish, but when you do, you regret it becauseit is over! This book deserves 10 stars!	2002-07-11

The authors of all the stories in the book wanted to see what would happen if things ended out differently for characters, such as Cinderella, instead of being the beautiful, thin, girl she was in the original, the author wanted to make her fat and see how the story would go. There was no problem with that, a twist in a fairy tale makes it more interesting once in a while. But most of the stories I read in this book had questionable endings and no lesson learned. The back cover made the book sound very interesting, but I ended up feeling that the whole reason that the stories were changed were because people wanted the fairy tales to be different and they were tired of the same old thing. They loved fairy tales, but it seemed as if they didn't think it was fair that Cinderella was pretty and that Jack got the harp from the giant's house.They modernized the story, put in some weird magic and then made the story end twisted. I think that fairy tales are meant to make you feel good. In this book, most of the endings were a bit sad and bizarre. I think I'll stick to the originals, thank you.	2002-01-27

He is frail and weak, and often made fun of.The job he has, is to watch the bukshah ( a fictional goat like animal) Lately however, the water has stopped flowing in the big stream that starts at a valley in the mountains. The whole village of Rin migrates to a different hill with water, but they notice that the water is beginning to stop there too. They suspect that something up in the mountains is stopping the water from flowing down. Some say it is a dragon that is stopping it, others refuse to believe it for there was no sound or smoke coming from the mountain or anything unusual.A few people decided to go. Rowan ended up going with the group(read the book to find out why!) and he was still the weakest. During their journey up the mountain there were many obstacles. Even though I liked this book, I thought it was a bit predictable. Nonetheless, it was a quick read and good for a rainy afternoon.	2002-01-27

The King, being a just, yet aging wildcat, saw more in Martin than the others. The King decided it wouldn't be wise to kill him, but the King's daughter, Tsarmina, a cold-hearted wretch, thought he deservd to be killed immediately. Tsarmina broke Martin's sword in her rage,a big mistake, for then Martin vowed he would slay her one day. Tsarmina poisoned her own father and then blamed it on her gentle, younger brother, Gingivere. She declared herself ruler of Kotir. She had Martin and Gingivere thrown into the dungeon. In the dungeon Martin met his cell mate, a prince of thieves by the name of Gonff. Gonff was a very comical character indeed ( he was my favorite) he always chanted verses of poems, even in the worst of times. Gonff and Martin became fast friends and decided to be mates. They both escaped out of the dungeon and went back to Mossflower. Bella of Brockall, knew as soon as she met Martin that he was a worthy one and sent him, Gonff and Dinny (the mole) on a mission to find Boar the Fighter who is also her father, in Salmandastron,( a land where no one has ever returned from) and tell him to come back to Mossflower for the mishap with Queen Tsarmina. As well as hearing Martin's quest, you also hear how the rest of the woodlanders dealt with Tsarmina's forces. Even though, Tsarmina's force's said woodlanders were dumb, the woodlanders would always outwit her forces somehow.

You see how strong Elizabeth had to remain, to see her sister pursue her with so much hate and remorse. You hear of what made Elizabeth never want to marry. This is an excellent book and if you have read The Royal Diary of Elizabeth then you would see that both books are spectacular. However in the Royal Diary their is less peril and horror as in this book because Elizabeth was younger. It's safe enough to say that Elizabeth suffered more as she became older.

Her sister (Ruthi) signs her up for a Fresh Air Fund which sends poor children too the country for 2 weeks in the summer. Dossi leaves excited and yet afraid to go on vacation with a family she doesn't know in Vermont for 2 weeks. She is stunned by things in the country and doesn't even know what fireflies are. This is one fault that I found with the book, she seems to know NOTHING of the country, now I can believe she's never milked a cow, but some of the things she had never seen are unbelievable. Anyway during the book she sprouts friendship and learns new things of her trip. She meets new people and learns what the lovely countryside is like. This is a really fast paced book, you should be able to finish it within an hour or so, but nonetheless it is worth reading.	2001-05-01

Annie begins to protest and is sure that someone is poisoning Magpie. It is up to her to help save Magpie before it's too late. This book was a little bit boring and it strongly resembled other History Mysteries. The plot is always the same. Young girl who has a passion for something. Soon that passion is taken or trying to be taken away. The young girl tries to find out who is trying to take this away. In the end everything is perfect. After reading a few history mysteries, I am beginning to tire. The history mysteries that I suggest you read however are, Secrets on 26th street and The Smuggler's Treasure.

Her father has reamrried now that his first wife (also Nissa's mother) Heirah Rae has run off to Chicago. Lara (her fathers new wife) is a quiet woman who is afraid of little things and problems. Nissa is growing and there are many physical changes of hers in the book. That's one thing I kind of thought was not appropiate to be discussed in a book, what if a boy read it? Anyway Nissa misses her mother and practically lives for the fact that her mother loves her. Nissa also ruins some of her happiness by always letting herself join in on the family problems. This is part of her misery. During the book Nissa begins to live life for herself and not for her mother. She forgives her mother and begins to love Lara like a person in her family and even I must say that you can't help forgiving Heirah Rae or liking Lara and forgiving her tantrums.	2001-04-24

Due to fights during their childhood, Ben's mother is hesitant. Finally she gives in and they are on thier way to his home. The rest of the book, you must read yourself.

She has an older sister, Angeline, who is beautiful and sometimes has remarks as cold as ice, a brother named Pinch, who to Omakayas is a nuisance, and her baby brother Neewo, who in Omakaya's eyes is perfect.

Cleopatra's older sister threatened to kill her own sister and father if they set foot in Egypt! boy am I glad that I don't live in ancient times. What makes this book good to read though is the fact that everything isn't goody good. Cleopatra wasn't that much of a saint in her time and in the book if you think about it she wasn't too sympathetic for Berenice. I also liked reading about the cruel ancient romans. The gladiators and the hungry tigers which proved that Romans were smart but one of the evilest people in history. This book is mostly true historically and a girl's emotional feelings about all of it is something worth reading!	2001-03-28

I was hooked on it till the end! It was really emotional and that's actually the first time that I became grateful for the shots we recieve so we don't get Polio. The friends that Peggy meet are really kind and I was surprised that none of them were jealous that Peggy had learned to walk. I was really surprised though when something as small as painted toenails meant so much to Peggy.This book wasn't all serious though, it had plenty of humor sparks and I wouldn't have liked it half as much otherwise. I really suggest this book!	2001-03-26

In the book Marie is a very well educated girl and she cares about her subjects. If she really did care then why did France have a revolution????? I read that she and her husband would spend hours wasting money by gambling and spending money on expensive clothing and jewelry. Marie Antoinette was a selfish brat, but the book wasn't based on Marie Antoinette. I guess that's how Marie Antoinette was from her own point of view.	2001-03-20

She does not act like other girls from her time period. Catherine always wants HER WAY and she'll complain as much as she wants otherwise. Karen Cushman gave Catherine real wit and her wit was quite entertaining!	2001-03-17

The thing about all the books that Karen Cushman writes is that the girls all have attitude and want everything their way.That's what I realy like about her books. Cathryn from Catherine called birdy is downright stubborn like Lucy. There's got to be some people in the world who want everything their way and Karen Cushman knows how!	2001-03-17

I really like the way Nellie Lee Love stays strong during all of her situations and that she sticks by her sisters side the whole time. She is a good example of how people felt in the 1900's when a lot of racism and prejudice was around.	2001-03-10

THIS BOOK IS GREAT! It was my first Dear America book and i was hooked on it beginning to end. this book is about a girl named Zipporah who moves to America and she makes a lot of friends. A lot of sad things happen though, for instance one of her friends dies in a fire by jumping out the window, and her sister marries a nonjewish boy and runs away. This book made me cry and I was furious at her sister who got married to a nonjewish boy and agreed with Zippy's mother who was furious too. I was surprised at how Zippy stayed calm during every single thing that happened. Zippy is a brave girl.	2001-03-10

I really wanted to read this book and I searched the library high and low to find it. As I started reading I read how everything began to fall apart. I felt really sad for Julie who had a maid she knew since she was born and then the maid betrayed her because Julie was a jew and the maid was a nazi. I could almost feel Julie's fear as she left Austria to go to America. I was very astonished to know that Julie's mother was a fashionholic. I never actually thought of people living in Europe during World War II as normal and as fearless as Julie's family.	2001-03-10

This in my opinion is my fave Dear America Diary. I like this one more than the others because, Madeline isn't such an adult like all the other characters,but she is a mere child and her father is away in the war. She is self-concious, like me and she is ashamed of some things she can't change. She makes friends and learns that none of her friends care that she has a gap between her teeth, or that she is not skinny enough. What I REALLY like about this book though is that it has a bit of everything. It has a bit of, humor, suspense, tragedy, and a bit of romance kid-style. It isn't too mUSHY or too Sad, or too funny, or too scary and mysterious and it gives a true point of view and she is like any girl today. I think that I am like Madeline in many ways!	2001-03-09

On my trips to the library I would always see this book and pass it without a second thought because when I looked at the title I thought it would be a book about a woman who just gets married and blah. but one day i thought, hey what the heck and i began to read. It was pretty good, but some parts were really nasty!! This book showed how people feel when they are around 12-13 and are forced to marry a man who is old enough to be their own father. It shows the emotions and feelings of a girl forced into marriage by her father. There were some parts that i didn't think the author should have added though. All in all i decided that the book was ten times better than I thought it would be and it was charming!	2001-03-09
