However, the cons far outweigh how government will ultimately use this micro-size chip to the point that all personal liberty and freedom is lost in our society.<br /><br />This book does have excellent research, however we also need excellent and ethical legislation to ensure that this technology is used with ethical care, rather than destroy \\"the land of the free.\\"<br /><br />It's a gripping book, and anyone interested in true and ethical democracy will find a lot in order here to initiate proper use of the RFID chip to preserve liberty and freedom for all.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE<br /><br />Editor, inspire! magazine	2005-10-04

Even the most advanced intelligent Mensch will kvell and at the wisdom that goes beyond Kvetching. It goes back to the ancient roots of how insightful and indistinguishable Yiddish is. It's a language that ties so many together from the diaspora when Jewish geography has people kibitzing, or Oy Veying at news that might come from a simcha.  It's a mitzvah for great reading, even for the savvy Yenta.  And more than being funny, the book has reads with scholar material, rich in the roots of tradition and ancestry.

Moms can be the most loving example of \\"having it all together\\" right at home.<br /><br />This book is a pivotal contribution to women who might want more \\"out there\\" and shows that you CAN have it ALL at home! You can raise children with love, have a home-based business, an income to call your own, and the respect you deserve from the inside out. The years FLY by. With this book, you can embrace these years with dignity and joy.<br /><br />[ Updated Review ]<br /><br />Please remember that this book is NOT written for mothers who work outside the home, but for women who CHOOSE to be stay-at-home Moms.<br /><br />If you are dissatisfied with your life, you can discover your real life purpose, and if you are a Mom raising children, you can create a home-based business, working with passion any joy. It's especially easy to do now with the Internet!<br /><br />Another important point is that CHILDREN NEED THEIR PARENTS TO RAISE THEM! So many cases of teen violence have been attributed to children who did NOT have loving, caring and supportive parents. I think what the author is trying to convey is that you can be a Happy Stay At Home Mom - that's really the significance of this book.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE<br />Editor, inspire! magazine	2005-09-21

After reading it, there is not a chance that I will consume anything that is not organic. No more sprayed pesticides that are in the soil, that grows the plants, or antibiotic and hormone fed animals that literally destroy our health.<br /><br />No matter what ailment you may have, it is covered in alphabetical order, along with a comprehensive list of what you can take, and what you should avoid, which is very helpful when one vitamin or mineral can counteract another. There are great recommendations, other resources, and this book always suggests that you consult with your health practitioner in addition to the suggestions given. It clearly states that this is not a \\"cure\\" however, I have found that since reading it and implementing the suggestions, I feel a lot more energy, and `diet' has now become a healthy eating routine, filled with nourishment.<br /><br />The book is something that can only add benefit to your life, and one that you can consult at any time over the years to achieve the greatest health possible.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence	2005-09-15

Those stuck in under funded, un-safe, and insidiously disadvantaged in equal education compared to children who have personal lap top computers, the best books, and safest learning conditions. This book is a vital call to equalize the educational methods as well as equalizing the distribution of funds to all school age children.<br />It opens the doors for direly needed changes so that each child receives equal education as an equal American citizen. The accounts in this book will open your heart to call for equalization rather than segregation based on economic conditions for our nation's children. This book can very well be a strong catalyst for revamping educational policies, distribution of funding, and to give each child the chance to attain the highest education possible which will end the cycle of poverty.

Eadie's words written so beautifully, she explains in great detail the universal \\"laws\\" that we are governed by, and gives a clear account on the process from her death experience to returning to life on Earth.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this book is how prayers are answered, and in what order. She goes into great detail showing how our deepest, most sincere, heart-felt prayers \\"shoot up like lasers of light beams\\" and are \\"immediately answered\\". Then there are the prayers that are said in rote, without any feeling - these are not even heard, and thus are not answered. In addition, our most sincere prayers need only be said once, we don't have to keep asking over and over again, or beg, plead, \\"bargain\\" etc. They are answered according to what is really for our highest good.<br /><br />Eadie goes on and literally brings to life the vivid picture of what it is like on the other side, and how the Angels gladly respond to every call. The beginning of the book clearly describes her transition to the other side, and I KNOW this account is for real, because on a personal note, what she describes in this book is the identical experience my own mother had in 1964 when she `died' giving birth to my sister, and the identical things my mother described to me are what Betty describes in this book, including being greeted by Jesus Christ.<br /><br />I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting, and before writing this review, I read a lot of it again. Eadie writes so beautifully and eloquently, and this book is really a pleasure to read. It is soft and wise. Interesting and insightful. It brings wonderful messages that anyone can benefit by, and is a beautiful contribution to the NDE genre.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and if you are really into this subject, another book that would be great with this one is `Saved by the Light\\" by Dannion Brinkley. Each book gives unique and vivid accounts from Earth to the Other Side, and back, along with the messages they are to bring to humanity in their `mission' on Earth.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to being THE ONE, and If God Was Like Man<br />Editor, inspire! magainzeEach book gives unique and vivid accounts from Earth to the Other Side, and back, along with the messages they are to bring to humanity in their `mission' on Earth.

Masses and acres of land have been literally washed away each hour for a long time.

It is all of our divine birthright to our connection to God, Holy Spirit, where there is unfailing guidance at every moment of life. This book teaches this to you.

Their names were Helen Schucman and William Thetford, Professors of medical Psychology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. It does not matter who they were, except that the story shows that with God all things are possible. They were anything but spiritual. Their relationship with each other was difficult and often strained, and they were concerned with personal and professional acceptance and status. In general, they had considerable investment in the values of the world...\\"<br /><br />The rest is a bit too lengthy to write here, however, Helen writes: \\"Three startling months preceded the actual writing...I was still very surprised when I wrote, `This is a course in miracles.' That was my introduction to the Voice. It made no sound, but seemed to be giving me a kind of rapid, inner dictation which I took down in a shorthand notebook. The writing was never automatic. It could be interrupted at any time and later picked up again...\\"<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that this book comes from God. God does write through humanity now just as much as it occurred thousands of years ago. Many people want a quick fix to the problems that plague them. I would venture to say that if the messages in this book are really taken in and applied within anyone's mind, judgment will cease, discord will cease, and inner peace will prevail.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE, and If God Was Like Man<br /><br />Editor, inspire! magazineerable investment in the values of the world...\\" <br /> <br />The rest is a bit too lengthy to write here, however, Helen writes: \\"Three startling months preceded the actual writing...I was still very surprised when I wrote, `This is a course in miracles.'

This is one book that I have recommended to so many people because what it does is it helps you to move out of your old comfort zone, when you are afraid of moving in a new, positive direction, and it gives golden insight into how to \\"feel the fear and do it anyway.\\"<br /><br />The domain of the ego is fear, based on the past. When you are about to move into a new direction, it often feels scary. This is because the ego has no prior point of reference to feel \\"safe\\" or \\"comfortable\\" in the new direction you are about to go in, even if it is entirely positive!<br /><br />With this wonderful book, you will learn how to move forward, despite the fear you have. One thing that I have learned is that if you were NOT moving out of your old (perhaps unhappy) comfort zone, you would not be feeling fear! So \\"fear\\" in this sense is positive, as it means that you are moving in a more life enhancing direction.<br /><br />I love this book. It is empowering, easy to read, apply and understand, and will make a wonderful difference in your life if you have felt afraid to take positive steps that move your life in the most positive direction possible.<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE<br /><br />Editor, inspire! magazine	2005-08-21

The TRUE Meaning of the Words of Jesus	I feel extremely fortunate to have read this spiritual gift. Emmet Fox, although no longer physically alive, brings humanity one of the most profound books I have ever read on the true meaning of what Jesus taught. The Sermon on the Mount is a SPIRITUAL classic, that I would (and do) recommend to anyone, no matter what your religion or doctrine may be, because the genuine spiritual meaning (so beautifully explained in this exceptional text) of what Jesus was trying to convey to humanity, will REALLY open your eyes, and your heart to the laws of this universe, and there is no religion or dogma attached<br />whatsoever.<br /><br />This is the kind of book, at least for me, where no matter HOW much I \\"thought\\" I knew, shows me once again, how much more there is to understand.<br /><br />To fully live the words in this book, in all of your thoughts, words, motives and deeds will DIFINITELY bring you a life of profound inner peace, and this will be a beacon for world peace.<br /><br />I wish every world leader could read this book. It is the metaphysical and immutable laws of the universe, the true \\"answers\\" to what Jesus was teaching, and it is given in modern language, while the book is fascinating and an exceptional read. There are few books that I re-read, this will be one of them, that is for sure!<br /><br />I genuinely beleive that the words in this book, if taken and applied, can \\"save\\" humanity from every peril currently known to humankind. That is a lot to say, however, I wholeheartedly beleive this to be true.<br /><br />If I could buy this book for everyone on Earth, I would. Get it, read it, and see if it makes a difference in your life. I would venture to say that it will, far beyone what you might beleive. It did for me, and I am deeply grateful to Emmet Fox whose Light lives on, and continues to make such a difference.<br /><br />This book is an Enlightening SPIRITUAL TREASURE!!!<br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE, and If God Was Like Man	2005-07-21

Just the loving energy I feel from reading the pages is an experience unto itself. There are a few quotes from this book that I would like to share with you.<br /><br />p.20 (About becoming illuminated from within) \\"The light is turned on within and illumination is... How you express your divinity is up to you. Holiness isn't something you have to find. You are this energy now. To know it is to honor the beauty within. We all have the same opportunity since we all come here with emotion and we all have the freedom to use it. God doesn't give a heart to one and ignore another.<br /><br />p. 113 \\"...Each soul is challenged according to its blocks. Wherever light is resisting love, big challenges are happening. But since you only come here to find more love, problems are solved as soon as you do.\\"<br /><br />p. 168 (About knowing oneself) \\"Isn't this the path that the pianist knows with his instruments, an athlete with her sport, or anyone with a gift that is nurtured through pleasurable discipline? Getting to know oneself is no different. Information about oneself comes from within. Therefore, this is where the focus needs to be.\\"<br /><br />In addition to this phenomenal text, there are wonderful and simple personal insight worksheets, where you can write down answers to questions that will definitely help you awaken to all that you are within.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to awaken to their grandest self that lies within. Thank you, Betsy, for your extraordinary contribution to humanity!<br /><br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE, and If God Was Like Man.<br /><br />Editor of inspire! magazine	2005-07-12

Peter Kramer did an outstanding job in presenting the debilitating effects of depression, how vital it is that this chemical imbalance is properly treated, and how society can relate to the depths of despair suffered by those who have gifted us with their genius while they endured suffering.<br /><br />This book would do well to be required reading for anyone that either is depressed, or is in a close relationship with someone that has this treatable disease. The societal stigma about depression is addressed prolifically and how people of the creative arts seek to overcome depression by pouring their heart and soul into their work. Make no mistake, depression is NOT a prerequisite for artistic or genius expression. It IS \\"the most devastating disease known to mankind\\" as eloquently accounted for in the personal stories of the lives of those who have suffered, without treatment. Kramer brings sanity to this often misunderstood disease, and his insights are direly needed.<br /><br />Along with this book, I would also highly recommend \\"Shortcut to Spirituality: Mastering the Art of Inner Peace\\" by Bob Gottfried, Ph.D., as the two books together would be a tremendous help to anyone that seeks to be free from depression, and have inner peace. They are both 10 Star Books! Outstanding!	2005-05-23

What happened is SHOCKING.<br /><br />They informed me that I could NOT write my own books!!!!<br />They told me I could not discuss any of the teachings!<br />They told me I could NOT write ARTICLES.<br /><br />I couldn't believe how controlling this cult organization is. They give glory to Kelsang Gyatso - where a true Buddhist gives the glory to Buddha.<br /><br />If you are looking for excellent Buddhist books I do *NOT* recommend this book, or any of the other Gyatso books. I do recommend the books by Eknath Easwaran such as THE DAMMAPADA.<br /><br />I share this with the utmost pure motives and hope it helps you in your spiritual growth.	2004-06-27

They just come right with us on the other side.<br />For a negative reviewer below, I shall share that Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's teachings are pure, with the motive to bring the teachings out of suffering that were taught by Buddha, in plain English that anyone can understand, so they can apply the teachings, and truly be free from suffering permanently in this life. The teachings have made an immeasurable difference in my life - suffering has vanished, and that was no small feat! I credit this to the teachings that have so eloquently been translated into English.<br />Other fantastic books by this author that I HIGHLY recommend are: \\"Universal Compassion\\" \\"Transform Your Life\\" \\"Joyful Path of Good Fortune\\" \\"The New Meditation Handbook\\"<br />They are all incredibly and immeasurably helpful for permanent benefit to all who wish to attain full awakening.

Then, practicing this, one can use certain experiences, certain tragedies to develop a calmness of mind. One must realize that every phenomena, every event, has different aspects.\\"<br />\\"It seems that often when problems arise, our outlook becomes narrow. All of our attention may be focused on worrying about the problem, and we may have a sense that we're the only one that is going through such difficulties. This can lead to a kind of self-absorption that can make the problem seem very intense. When this happens, I think seeing things from a wider perspective can definitely help - realizing for instance, that there are many other people who have gone through similar experiences, and even worse experiences.\\"<br />When Howard Cutler questioned about dealing with anger, his question was: \\"...You might think about an event...even much later, and every time you think about it you become angry all over again. How would you suggest dealing with (this.\\")<br />The Dalai Lama had this to say on P. 175: \\"If you look from a different angel, then surely the person who caused this anger in you will have a lot of other positive aspects, positive qualities. If you look carefully, you will also find that the act which has made you angry has also given you certain opportunities, something which otherwise would not have been possible, even from your point of view. So with effort you'll be able to see many different angles to a single event. This will help.\\"<br />By reading this book, you will gain a greater understanding of HOW to transform the difficulties in your life, by transforming your views of them. It will greatly contribute to your inner peace, as well as peaceful relations with others, along with how to deal with life's constant changes with calm and assurance.<br />Highly Recommended!

Dr. Atkins was his doctor, as was Barry Sears, author of &quot;The Zone&quot; who was his nutritionist. Rubin was eating well but he was still sick.<br />He found in the Old Testament of the Bible the dietary laws that Moses brought to humanity from God, which is basically to stay away from pork and shellfish, and eat natural foods.<br />In our modern society, this correlates to not eating anything that has preservatives, artificial sweeteners, and to avoid ingesting animal foods where the animals are fed growth hormones, are raised with toxins, and are not fed in a healthy manner.<br />This diet has nothing to do with religion, as Rubin has stated in interviews that a person can keep \\"Kosher\\" and still ingest artificial sweeteners, and foods that have unhealthy preservatives. The information prescribed in this diet is identical to the dietary messages contained in the book \\"If God Was Like Man\\" which is to not ingest anything that has preservatives, including animal meats where the animals are raised on unhealthy farms.<br />In a nutshell, eat foods that are naturally made, or made from nature such as organic fruits, vegetables, fish from clean water, bread that has no preservatives, and avoid ALL artificial sweeteners, and preservatives, because they are NOT preserving your body, but causing ill health instead. You can find certain nutritional supplements (such as calcium) in most health food stores, however, as long as you are consuming only \\"food made from nature\\" sans the preservatives, you will preserve your life, and become healthier. The diet contained in this book is a natural one, coming from a man who is devoting his life to help humanity live longer and healthier. This book will help you on your journey. Eat Well!	2004-04-22

This book is more for a person who is trying to figure out what their life is all about, and who feels trapped in a life that feels almost empty or meaningless.<br />Osho's writings about people in America, being \\"asleep\\" and un-awakened may offend some readers in the USA. My suggestion is to take the great wisdom Osho brings in this book that applies to you in your life so that you can move forward in a positive way, and to simply let the more opinionated views of people in the West roll off your back. This book does have some great wisdom that many could use, and at the same time, some people may feel slighted from his judgmental tone.<br />His book is worth reading; just don't let your ego get in the way so you can take in the worthwhile wisdom he genuinely gives.	2004-04-21

I wanted to give you a sample of Eckhart Tolle's profound guidance concerning relationships, as this area continues to plague men and women.<br /><br />\\" Never before have relationships been as problematic and conflict ridden as they are now. As you may have noticed, they are not here to make you happy or fulfilled. If you continue to pursue the goal of salvation through a relationship, you will be disillusioned again and again. But if you accept that the relationship is here to make you conscious instead of happy, then the relationship will offer you salvation, and you will be aligning yourself with the higher consciousness that wants to be born into this world.\\"<br /><br />\\"Do not accuse each other of being unconscious. The moment you start to argue, you have identified with a mental position & are now defending not only that position but also your sense of self. The ego is in charge. You have become unconscious. At times, it may be appropriate to point out certain aspects of your partner's behavior. If you are very alert, very present, you can do so without ego involvement - without blaming, accusing, or making the other wrong.\\"<br /><br />\\"LEARN TO GIVE EXPRESSION to what you feel without blaming. Learn to listen to your partner in an open, nondefensive way.<br />Give your partner space for expressing himself or herself. Be present. Accusing, defending, attacking - all those patterns that are designed to strengthen or protect the ego or to get its needs met will then become redundant. Giving space to others - and to yourself - is vital.<br />Love cannot flourish without it.\\"<br /><br />This book brings you profound wisdom to free you from pain in all areas of your life, and bring you fully into the present to illuminate your true self. It is one to  re-read many times, as well as to share with others.<br />Highly Recommended!<br />Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidenceo Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence	2004-04-20

An Example to Follow	Tina Santi Flaherty brings us another wonderful book about the remarkable woman of character we all remember as Jackie.<br />Through this heart-felt book, we are reminded of the qualities that I personally have always admired and watched when Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was alive.<br />She was a lady, and maintained her dignity. She kept her private life private, and was an example of fine character. She loved her husband unconditionally, and raised two beautiful children as a devoted mother.<br /><br />Jacqueline was the epitome of grace and elegance. She wrote thoughtful notes to people whenever they did something kind for her. She overcame deep pain and adversity by bringing out her true inner strength, rather than crumble. She was charitable, philanthropic and humane. She cared about preserving art and culture. She worked as an editor, and maintained her humility.<br />No matter what tragic or painful circumstance was before her, she faced it, and overcame much.<br /><br />Thank you Tina for keeping the beautiful memory of an exceptional woman alive.<br />This Book is A Great Read!<br />Barbara Rose, author of \\"Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE\\" and 'If God Was Like Man'<br />Editor of inspire! magazine	2004-04-16

Edward Conlon brings you the gripping reality of the behind-the-scenes life, emotions, and realism of what it is like to be a police officer in NYC.<br />I read this with great interest, where the truth Conlon wrote about completely corresponded with the many facts my Grandfather spoke of decades ago when he received a gold medal of honor as a NYC Sergeant. There is so much reality in this book, sometimes tragic reality, that every police officer must endure, while they protect and serve, and put their lives on the line, as they encounter the horrors resulting from inhumane acts that they have to personally witness and attend to.<br />Overworked, and underpaid, police officers have many stories to tell, many memories they have to block out or grow a thick skin in order to continue on, despite horrific cases and losses of colleagues that have put their lives on the line to protect others. Edward Conlon brings you the stories, and the facts in an incredible page-turner of a book.<br />BLUE BLOOD is by far one of the best, if not THE best book that brings you the reality of the life of a police officer. It is all too true, a phenomenal read that reads like a 5 star novel, however, it brings you the truth that is larger than fiction.<br />Highly recommended for its authenticity, and reality.

Eckhart Tolle brings us all powerful and transformative insight to shed the layers of ego that have your mind clinging to either the past or the future, seeking or reminiscing, longing or avoiding, and in its place, bringing you into THIS moment - in the here and now, where ALL reality exists, and gives you the power to change any aspect of your life from this moment, which is where all change comes from.<br /><br />Surrendering to the now is a fearful process because the domain of the ego is the past, and the emotion of the ego is fear. Love, on the other hand, exists now. One of the most powerful parts of this book teaches you to \\"become the watcher\\" of your thoughts. Just step aside and NOTICE what is going through your mind. Once you notice it, you can then be objective about it, rather than be consumed with fear, doubt, anxiety, worry, or anticipation.<br /><br />This book is a gift to humanity, a classic, and will bring you more conscious awareness of yourself, the dramas (the ego loves drama) and how to rise above it all by pulling yourself deeply into the present moment, fully.

Steven Englund did a remarkable job in bringing humanity and depth to Princess Grace, from her acting days, to her marriage to the Prince of Monaco. What I found poignantly touching was how much Grace missed her acting days, and how she was not able to continue acting due to her role as Princess of Monaco. Grace was the epitome of a gem of a soul who sought to help the sick, the poor, and the downtrodden. She did so through charities she created, and set an example of the power of giving. If you are interested in reading a biography that is in depth, genuine, and filled with examples to follow, I highly recommend this book.

The plays are presented in chronological order, and the introductions give newcomers to Shakespeare's work an understanding of what each play is all about, as well as the history behind it. \\"King Lear\\" is included both as it was originally written, as well as Shakespeare's revision of it years later.<br />There is an in-depth glossary at the back of the book that will help the new reader of this work understand many of the words that were written in the plays at that point of time. Another wonderful addition is an index to the first line of sonnets, and the page that sonnet can be found on.<br />This revised book will bring readers of Shakespeare's work closer to their original meaning thanks to the painstaking updating, while keeping the original titles in tact.

The Dammapada went to the core of my being like few books have done before. This book literally transformed previous pain into genuine compassion and understanding.

Through the down-to-earth, brilliantly written pages, Donald J. Trump sets an example of ethics, passion about your work, integrity, having an \\"open door\\" and learning something every day. His book inspired me and gave me more pointers about \\"thinking big\\" in business, because as the book states: \\"...what's the difference between losing $100,000 or hundreds of millions of dollars... so you might as well have really gone for it.\\"<br />\\"TRUMP How to Get Rich\\" goes way beyond a quick money making strategy. It is a genuine life philosophy, and while reading this book, it often reminded me of Dale Carnegie's books. I would say that Donald Trump is the Dale Carnegie of business, but that is far too limiting. This book will teach you a lot more than how to get rich. He writes about when he lost nearly everything, and why. (He wasn't staying on top of everything.) He shares with genuine honesty, humility and dignity. There are so many life lessons in this book, all geared to your success.<br />Highly recommended if you are passionate about creating the success you deserve. 10 Stars!<br /><br />Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and If God Was Like Man<br />Editor, inspire! magazine	2004-03-31

HIGHLY Recommended!	Real Boys' Voices is a powerful journey into the minds of guys who have been raised to `hold it in' `be a man' `don't show how you really feel' and this sad list has haunted growing boys well into their painful adult years.<br />Pollack offers EXCEPTIONAL guidance to show us all, parents, peers, teachers, colleagues, and society as a whole to change the paradigm and start to allow boys to be REAL HUMAN BEINGS.<br />MEN HAVE FEELINGS! One topic that is touched on is that guys are actually being manipulated, and molded to follow, rather than to BE who they authentically are. It is imperative that boys, teen age guys, and all men are honored and ACCEPTED for who they really are, and not what others want them to be. This book brings pivotal advice to anyone who is in the presence of a young man to honor that man, for who he is.<br />It is a well known fact in psychology that either a person is going to talk it out, or act it out.<br />We owe it to the guys in our society to allow them the freedom and acceptance of honoring their own truth, and allowing them to express it, even if we may not agree.<br />By giving guys unconditional love, acceptance, and support on all levels, they WILL grow into men who are whole and complete, and will thus have the capacity to express that in the outer world, which includes being able to be authentic in intimate relationships. If boys are taught to hide their real feelings, how can they EVER know how to be REAL?<br />This book plays a crucial role in our society for males of all ages. It gets to the heart of the matter, and that is being loved and accepted for who they are. Only then will they know HOW to express their authenticity in their outer life.<br />BUY THIS BOOK!

I found it to be a wonderful introduction to the ancient teachings that were once reserved solely for Rabbi's and `Holy One's'.<br />We are ALL `Holy' and deserve to learn and understand the wisdom that is now available for everyone.<br />I found it most helpful to study at the Kabbalah Center in Los Angeles, where the teachings go into much more depth, and where more insight can be gained.<br />If I learned anything that had lasting value, it was that `All comes from the Light'. This was a great lesson to understand `how' and `why' certain events happen in our lives when we may feel shattered on every level.<br />Just a word of caution: If you feel that it is becoming `too much' then back off, and study another path for a while. The study of Kabbalah is DEEP, and for some, it is too deep. I too had to back off, but I found myself returning to the many books written on this subject once I integrated the wisdom with genuine understanding. All in all, this is the ONE book that sets the stage for this deep spiritual study.

The AWARENESS that Don Miguel Ruiz brings humanity about our mental \\"agreements\\" that we have been taught, and have subsequently attached ourselves to, have been the basis for all human suffering. The gift this book brings us are the simple, yet impeccable manner in which we can break those inner agreements, once we are aware of what they are. To be impeccable with your word, because it carries so much power, both to hurt, and to heal. To not take anything personally, because people do what is coming from their OWN belief system, and truly has nothing to do with us. The big one for me was: \\"Don't Make Assumptions.\\"<br />Making assumptions, instead of having the guts to ask questions to gain clarity, has certainly caused much pain for me. I would venture to say I am not alone in this category.<br />I learned a new way to view \\"problems\\" as \\"agreements\\" I took on during various stages of my life. Most importantly, I learned to replace those agreements (in whatever way I am the Victim or the Judge) and to make new agreements that suite me, and myself alone, without the need for approval of anyone.<br />With new agreements, we become FREE to truly love: ourselves, to love all others, and to release judgment and blame.<br />This is a powerful book that can be read within an hour.

HOW can we heal? This book has the insight &amp; the answers. After an 18 month rollercoaster, the ride finally ended in healing self. THAT is the ONLY way to never repeat the toxic patterns that both thrill and agonize a person who loves another, but has deep rooted issues to heal. There is NO mistake about who &quot;avoids&quot; the relationship, and who &quot;demands&quot; more of it. The greatest parts of this book are the genuine sharing of the Authors, and the profound insight to HEAL, which transforms pain into hope; if not for a current or recently ended relationship, than for a future healthy one. Happiness is possible, healing is required. This groundbreaking book shows us how. THANK YOU!!	2002-02-21

This book will show you what you have put up with, and how to re-claim your SELF, by setting boundaries that are healthy, and deserved. If you are a guy who truly hates women, then this book will show you why, and how you can view the woman in front of you for who she genuinely is, rather than the blanket label you have attached to her based on previous negative experiences. It is eye opening in the pinpointing of behaviors, reactions, and patterns that cause us all to feel bad in the end. I highly recommend this book to any woman who loves a man she can never please,and any to man who does not \\"want to love\\" a woman.	2002-02-21

This book also exposed how unstable broadcast journalism is in terms of a secure job. Linder explains how a network can simply buy out your contract, and replace you. Thats why you will see a face on the 6:00 news and three months later theyre not in your viewing area. They had to find a new position, in a smaller, or sometimes if they are fortunate, a larger market.<br />This book is crucial to learn about the true ins and outs of this business. What many do not realize, is that News is a BUSINESS.<br />If you have a voice, and want your opinion heard, become an author, or a commentator, because a journalist cannot get involved in the story. Thats the number one rule in ethical journalism. The job is to report both sides of the story, period.<br />Additionally, this insightful book teaches you exactly what you need to do to get a broadcasting job to begin with. Ken Linder did such an outstanding job explaining the true gist of the business, that I became an author instead. I am deeply grateful to him for writing this book. It is packed with information that is difficult to find at best. Thank you Ken, your book deserves 10 stars!<br /><br />Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and If God Was Like Man<br />Editor, inspire! magazine	2001-01-19
