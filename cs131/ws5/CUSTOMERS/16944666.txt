The utilization of short sequences of related information continuing in a progressive manner makes the book easy to follow and understand. Having to make a response after every statement and then having the correct response readily available leads to accurate, systematic comprehension of the material presented.<br /><br />The vast majority of people who become involved or interested in the problems of mental retardation have little or no background experience. Most available instructional materials relating to the subject are complicated texts which necessitate more effort than many people are willing to expend. Thus, they continue to lack good basic knowledge about the condition. Drs. Flanigan and Baker and Mrs. LaFollett's text overcomes that problem with its logical patterned approach.<br /><br />In addition to some of the more obvious persons whose training and understanding would be enhanced by exposure to the programmed text, there are certain other groups for whom the book would seem to be ideally directed. Many community organizations have mental retardation as a project and are searching constantly for accurate data.<br /><br />A specific organization for which I can see great potential use of this book is YOUTH Associations for Retarded Children (Youth Organized and United to Help the Mentally Retarded). The thousands of teen-agers involved in the YOUTH ARC movement are anxious to acquire information on mental retardation. This text could give them this knowledge in a new, easier, and more exacting manner. YOUTH ARC'ers are action-oriented and do not want to spend all their efforts reading about mental retardation. They want to get involved in direct service programs. I know of no other resource text that would be more effective orientation tool than this would be.<br /><br />This text represents an excellent new resource toward good understanding of the mentally retarded, what the retarded need, and some of the ways to go about meeting these needs.<br /><br />~ Merlen G.

Every drill is explained in detail, and, when feasible, is further clarified by line drawings or photographs.  Thus, the book's mail value is as a reference to the specific problems of teaching skills.<br /><br />Second, to present and include only drills that have been proven.  This has automatically ruled out approximately one hundred drills on hand that are interestnig but not yet tested.<br /><br />The present edition differs from the original text in four respects.  First, it includes new drills and illustrations.  Second, it contains an entirely new part on conditioning drills complete with photographs especially prepared for each drill.  Third, it presents a complete new chapter on quarterback drills.  To the author's knowlege, this is the first time a complete chapter on drills to train the quarterback has appeared in print.

But his is not just another self-help book; it is the result of years of passionate effort on the part of its author to help people achieve better health. Nutrition counseling has played a major role in Dr. Manahan's large and successful medical practice. Over the years, Dr. Manahan has seen many of his patients' lives improve dramatically through simple dietary changes.  With the information Dr. Manahan provides in this book, you too, can take positive steps to improve your diet and your health.<br /><br />  Chapters dealing with caffeine, salt, sugar, fats, milk, and processed foods pinpoint specific problem areas and give the reader a better understanding of the relationships between food, health, and disease. Throughout this book, Dr. Manahan helps you identify the elements in your diet that are causing you problems. The chapters on milk and dairy products may seem revoluntionary to some readers, the concept that dairy sensitivity is related to a wide range of health problems is still not universally accepted.  Dr. Manahan does an excellent job in clarifying this relationship.<br /><br />  The best of information is of little use without an action plan. The most significant contribution of this book is that it emphasizes implementation; it shows you how to take concrete action based on your new knowledge of nutirtion and of the problems cased by certain foods. Dr. Manahan takes a \\"non-faddish\\" approach toward healthful eating habits. Drawing upon the current recommendations of the American Heart Association, the National Cancer Institute, and the dietary goals of federal health agencies, he gives the reader authentic tools for developing a healthier lifestyle.<br /><br />  I extend my congratulations to Dr. Manahan for his excellent contribution to all of us concerned about health improvement and a healthy diet for everyone, from kids through seniors.

It worked so successfully that she began teaching others her method.  That method is now the famous smokEnder program.<br /><br />After more than a decade of working with thousands of smokers, she now speaks to the smoker-as one who understands the frustration and discouragement of others who feel trapped and unable to free themselves.  She helps the smoker pinpoint his attitudes about smoking and strip away the years of rationalization  \\"A smoker can learn to walk away from it with his head up and a smile on his face,she insists, \\"if he knows HOW to prepare for quitting.\\"<br /><br />The smokEnder program, developed by Jacquelyn Rogers with the help of her husband, Dr. Jon Rogers, is known throughout the U. S., Canada, and Europe.<br /><br />\\"Provides fresh new insight into the subject-particularly nonthreatening to smokers and helpful to nonsmokers who are at a loss in helping their loved one who smoke\\"...-Donald T.
