Killed on stage while performing the infamous bullet catching trick, Harry Houdini (a friend and colleague who wisely refrained from ever attempting the trick) later theorized that Soo had been deliberately murdered, or committed a bizarre form of suicide. Steinmeyer's book not only illuminates what really happened during Soo's tragic final performance the night of March 23, 1918, he weaves a fascinating tale of deception, rivalry, and illusion in the dark world of magic 100 years ago.<br /><br />Whether you're a historian, a magician, a theatre buff, or simply looking for a good summer read, \\"The Glorious Deception\\" delivers magic aplenty.

While much of it is entertaining, Iggulden dumbs the historical facts down to a degree that borders on insulting.  The high-born young Gaius (a.k.a. Julius) Caesar, and his childhood friend Marcus (later known as Brutus), share some amazing childhood adventures a la &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot;, which include being trained for battle by star gladiator and curmudgeon Rennius, fighting blue-faced savages, and saving the family farm. There is much worth reading in the book, but Iggulden should do his readers a favor and tell history like it was if he is going to write about recognizable characters.  The brilliance of Steven Saylor's &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; series, and John Maddox Roberts' &quot;SPQR&quot; novels is that both authors accurately portray known history and historical figures, and then invent like hell around them to create whopping great stories. Iggulden could certainly learn a thing or two from them.  I look forward to seeing where the next installment will lead us, and can only hope Iggulden learns to trust his readers with the facts.	2003-01-28

Now my 4 year old daughter and I both get to experience the exquisite pleasure of Ferdinand on a regular (i.e. nightly) basis.  The gorgeous illustrations and simple, powerful story of the biggest bull on the farm who would rather \\"sit just quietly and smell the flowers\\", is as moving today as it was when it was written more than 50 years ago.  And I cannot think of a more important lesson to teach our children today: that it is o.k. to be yourself, even when everyone else thinks you should be something else.  This is a sweet, lovely story for children and adults alike, and is one of the few books I look forward to reading over and over again.  Luckily, my daughter agrees.	2003-01-28

Eco's most delicious skills as a writer are put to good use in this entertaining tale: his rich use of language, and sense of mischief really shine in Baudolino.  But...not all of it works as well as Eco may have wished.  There are long passages which might be fascinating to a medieval studies professor, but leave the average intelligent reader stifling a yawn. Read it, but know what you're getting into (I kept a dictionary by my bedside to look up obscure words and object descriptions).  That said, there are as many vignettes that delight, move, and entrall (the section where Baudolino meets and falls in love with a Hypatia, weaving ancient Greek myth into a tale already packed with fantastic creatures is nothing short of brilliant).  And you have to admire the fact that Eco's final line, archly delivered by Baudolino, is clearly a tongue-in-cheek jest at himself. With so winning an author, it's hard not to like his creation.	2003-01-28

Phillippa Gregory has managed to pull off a nearly impossible feat - weaving a tapestry of Tudor England, the struggles of Henry the VIII to sire an heir with the tempestuous Anne Boleyn, and the long-ignored sister of history, Mary Boleyn - in a way that is fresh, immediate, fascinating, and amazingly contemporary. Gregory gives us an utterly real cast of characters, with foibles and failings aplenty, but for all their flaws, we still feel, care and love them as we would difficult siblings. The machinations of the Tudor court and Henry's obsession with fathering a son (no matter the cost) combined with the ruthless ambition of the Howard/Boleyn clan makes for a riveting, bawdy ride through some lesser known rooms of Tudor history. Gregory is equally effective at painting (with a gossamer touch) the lot of highborn ladies at that time; often no better than cattle to the market of Royal ambition, we feel deeply for their lot, and cheer when Mary Boleyn - obedient daughter sent to bed the king - ultimately rejects everything for love. It is greatly to Gregory's credit that I quickly forgot I was reading about historical figures, they seemed so real and utterly human that even as I was hating some of them, I worried for their (foregone) fate. This is a splendid read, lucid, passionate, and deeply moving. Brava, Phillippa Gregory!	2002-12-10

Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, and I have to say, Pullman surpasses them all. With effortless grace and an amazing imagination, Pullman essentially re-tells the story of the fall of man through the characters of two utterly real, conflicted and all too human children, Lyra and Will.  They are pitted against dark forces, but are given some astonishing helpmates and tools with which to fight a battle for nothing less than the souls of all humanity. Assisted by Daemons and Angels, Lyra and Will seek the answer to a puzzling mystery - what is \\"Dust\\", and why is it spilling out of the universe?  Pursued by some very determined and evil adults, Lyra and Will meet armored bears, flying explorers, and witches in their travels through parallel worlds to find the answer and elude their persecutors. Dark, richly imagined, occasionally terrifying, Pullman is a breathtaking storyteller.  Young adults will love the fantastic creatures and situations Lyra and Will must surmount, and adults will get a kick out of references to Milton's Paradise Lost, and Dante's Divine Comedy.  Young or old, this is a brilliant series of books best read in one juicy gulp.	2002-11-11

I had just read the Steven Saylor \\"Roma Sub Rosa\\" series, featuring the lovably human Gordianus the Finder, so I felt a bit disloyal even picking up a Maddox Roberts book, but, WOW! am I glad I did. Roberts writes with effortless skill, a keen understanding of complex Roman politics and social hierarchies, and, best of all, a delicious sense of mystery. SATURNALIA, is a wicked tale of murder and adultery, set against the twilight of Rome's Republic. The scandalous Clodia is accused of poisoning her husband (all of this is based on historical events), and Maddox Roberts takes the opportunity to explore some of Rome's darker sides in the process. Roberts' hero - a Junior Senator with the unwieldy name of Decius Caecilius Metellus - is a wonder: patrician by birth, he is able to walk with equal confidence in marble halls, and the stinkiest streets of the Subura.  I highly recommend not only SATURNALIA, but all the other novels in the SPQR series. You'll fall in love with Decius, and discover sides to ancient Rome you never knew existed.	2002-09-11

Chessman's style is elegant, and spare, and she limns a portrait as lovingly as Cassatt painted Lydia.  If I have any criticism, it's that I wished the novel had a broader scope - it covers a very brief period when Cassatt and her family lived in Paris.  I wanted to know more about the family before they came to Europe, and how at that time in history a woman was able to rise to such prominence in the epicenter of the birth of modern art. Chessman is an accomplished writer, and yet the book is not as deeply felt as it could be, perhaps because of its brevity.  Still, it is a tale well worth the telling, and a pleasure to read.	2002-09-11

And the gorgeous illustrations - taking Pirate Pete and his harried parrot from Candy Island to Dragon Island, to the treasure bearing Mermaid Island are an utter delight.  This is a rarity in children's books  - a tale that is as fun for adults as it is for kids, and one which stands the test of multiple (often nightly) readings.  Arrr!

It was a little jarring at first to read a novel by a contemporary author written in the voice of Victorian literature, but Blake is a master storyteller, and I soon forgot that I wasn't reading a long-lost Bronte sister's epic.  Her tone and pitch is pefect, and the increasing build of tension as the story speeds towards its climax is worthy of Henry James. Blake is equally successful in making Grange House itself an ominous, creepy character which casts its shadow across everyone else in the book.  The heroine's journey from pampered rich girl to a deeply insightful young woman is told gracefully and powerfully, and the threads which weave all of the main characters to Grange House are masterfully woven. As a fan of the Brontes, Thomas Hardy, and many other Victorian writers, I found Grange House to be a fine and fitting descendant.  There are some genuinely moving and surprising moments throughout, particularly in our heroine's discovery of her true past, and how her life is closely interwoven with the Grange family. But Blake also examines (quite successfully) the nature of creativity, the legacy of being a storyteller, and the ethereal bonds of love that persist even from beyond the grave. A perfect read for a long winter's eve.	2001-12-16

A lonely Miss Spider wants to have a tea party, but all the other bugs flee in terror when they see her.  By the end of the book (told in a series of rhyming verses), however, the other bugs discover an important secret: Miss Spider is kind and thoughtful, and, she only eats flowers. When word spreads that their perception of her was wrong, Miss Spider soon finds herself surrounded by new friends.  What I love about David Kirk's books is his perfect blending of words and pictures.  His tales are simple, elegant, moving stories about the power of love, the importance of friendship, and seeing beyond exteriors to the gold that dwells within every creature's heart, and his paintings are stunning.  I highly recommend any of the Miss Spider (or Little Miss Spider) books.  They are a treat for adults and children alike, destined to be favorite reads and lifetime classics.	2001-11-21

But it is a great tribute to Valerie Martin's crisp writing that you soon forget it was ever a film, much less who starred in it, and are caught up in the quietly creepy spell she weaves as a housemaid in Victorian London slowly discovers the truth about her Master, Mr. Jekyll, and his strange, brutish assistant, Mr. Hyde. Martin wisely allows the story to unfold slowly, and she brilliantly ups the ante with the threat of impending violence and its ultimate tragic ending.  Her portrait of Mary Reilly, an abused housemaid who finds solace and kinship in her strange master, is poignant, richly detailed, and gorgeously written.  Forget the film, read this remarkable book and treat yourself to first-rate story telling and writing.	2001-11-21

Trees transform into sauropods, and boulders metamorphose into ferocious theropods.  Soon the two factions of dinosaurs are at war, an enormous volcano erupts, and Shadow must find the dinosaur bone and bury it to put a stop to the destruction.  The pictures are magnificent, and while the story is simple enough for a toddler, it is also rich enough to interest much older children (and adults).  People think it is hilarious when my daughter recites the names of the various dinosaurs (brachiosaurus, allosaurus), and I'm thrilled that we may have a natural historian in the family.  This is a terrific, entertaining and informative book for anyone who loves dinosaurs (and who in their right mind doesn't?).	2001-11-21

Well, guess what, the guy has every reason to be arrogant.  This is a stunningly written novel with almost operatic scope, charting three lives which coalesce at the house of the title, with tragic results.  Dubus weaves an almost hypnotic spell in this richly detailed story of an ex-drug addict who loses her home, the Iranian businessman who buys it for a song at a county auction, and the disenchanted cop who shows up to move the owner out.  Their lives begin to unravel even as Dubus cleverly weaves their threads more closely, and there is a terrible feeling of inevitability permeating the plot as it unfolds.  If you appreciate first-rate writing, and intelligent story-telling, this book is for you.  Don't miss it!	2001-11-10

So I it was with great anticipation that I bought GOOD HARBOR. Diamant wisely chooses a topic as far from Biblical times as possible, and the two novels couldn't be more different.  Two women at a crossroads in their lives and marriages meet in the small town of Gloucester, Massachusetts, and become fast friends.  The setting is rich with possibilities, but Diamant's intentions are more successful than her execution.  The simplicity of style which worked so well and powerfully in RED TENT here seems to undermine the emotional arc of the two women, Joyce and Kathleen, and we never care for them as deeply as we could.  Kathleen's battle with breast cancer, and her attempt to make peace with her son's death 25 years earlier just doesn't move us as it should. And when a lonely Joyce drifts farther and farther from her husband and teenaged daughter into an affair with a handsome Irish fisherman, who will never fully consummate their physical relationship, we, too, feel unfulfilled. Diamant is a hugely talented author, but GOOD HARBOR just isn't in the same class as THE RED TENT. Let's hope her next effort proves more worthy, since she obviously has the talent and the vision to write brilliantly when the topic moves her.	2001-11-05

Chevalier can take her place among luminaries such as Edith Wharton and James Joyce in her ability to closely observe the ordinary details of individual lives, elevating them to the extraordinary.  In this second novel, Chevalier simultaneously unveils the threads of 8 (or more) lives which intersect at a cemetary.  But the novel is about the living, and Chevalier brilliantly and effortlessly limns remarkable portraits of characters ranging in age from 5 to 50 with equal depth and ability.  The writing is gorgeous, and the story of the friendship of two young girls coming of age in Edwardian London, the travails of their parents, and the clash of morals in a new age is nothing short of brilliant.  Brava, Tracy Chevalier!  Let's hope we don't have long to wait for her third effort.  If she keeps topping herself with each novel, I predict a Pulitzer in her future.  READ THIS BOOK!	2001-11-05

What infuses this masterful book with life, however, are the quirky, intelligent letters written to him by his daughter.  Cloistered in a convent from the time she was a young girl, Suor Maria Celeste's loving correspondence to her father reveals the human side of Galileo.  But the scope of Sobel's book encompasses more than the sum of its parts - in the final analysis, we are treated to the inner workings of a surprisingly &quot;modern&quot; approach to science (not least of which was the concept of a sun centered planetary system) in the face of malevolent censorship by the Catholic church.  When Galileo is condemned of heresy, Sobel's book illuminates the political machinations behind the church's case, so that we understand the motivations (some of them nasty and personal) that fueled the fire. More importantly, we feel for the all too frail Galileo, under house arrest in the twilight of his life, and cheer when the centuries finally celebrate the genius that he was.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but it is a genuinely moving surprise.  Brava Dava Sobel!	2001-11-02

Ponder no more.  EATERS OF THE DEAD is a brilliant tour de force exploring the legend of Beowulf through the eyes of an Arab travelling into Viking lands in the 10th century.  Crichton weaves actual historical fact seamlessly with myth and legend to create an &quot;eye witness&quot; account of a ferocious battle between warriors en route to Valhalla and monsters of the mist.  This is one of the few books made into a film (released under the title &quot;THE 13TH WARRIOR&quot;) where the film actually improves upon what is already a gem of a book.  Read the book, then rent the movie.  John McTiernan's masterful direction, and the incredibly spooky locations make this tale of superstition and terror a great ride (and it's one of the best performances Antonio Banderas has ever given - he wisely chose to be part of a stellar ensemble cast).

Shame on me.  The two books are extraordinary in their own right, and deserve not to compared.  GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE is a marvelous reverse pentimento of a little known Vermeer painting - starting with a completed work of art, and tracing its byzantine provenance back to the moment of its creation.  The interweaving threads of human tragedy and joy surrounding the painting make for a rich and emotionally charged tale.  I went out and immediately bought a book of Vermeer's paintings after reading this, imagining the utter absorption and family chaos that surrounded his life and work - a life and work that Susan Vreeland brings to glorious life in this lovely, lyrical book.

Friends, Romans, countrymen (and women)...it was with a heavy heart I began this (as of now) final volume of the delightful Roma Sub Rosa series featuring the &quot;last honest man in Rome&quot;, Gordianus, the Finder (finder of truth, in case you're joining the party late).  Heavy because I don't know how long I will have to wait until the silver pen of Steven Saylor yields another Gordianus gem.  But enough of my whining.  LAST SEEN IN MASSILIA, like many of the books in this incredible series, has an awesome backdrop - it is the final hours of the civil war, Pompey and Caesar's troops are vying for the strategically important town of Massilia as an ally.  Massilia has cast its lot with Pompey, and is now besieged by Caesar's troops.  The city is awaiting relief from Pompey, but in the meantime, Caesar's troops are determined to take the city.  It is a credit to Saylor and his research (as much as literary license), that so many of the Gordianus tales take us to seminal moments in history, and place our beloved Finder squarely in the center of the action.  Whose eyes could be better to watch the unfolding pageant of violence, political ambition, and personal machinations than Gordianus?  This is a fine addition to the collection, though unlike many of the others, if you haven't read at least one or two of the other books, you might feel a little lost.  The theme of lost children plays well, even as it takes a dizzying course, and the ending as far as Gordianus' ultimate choice felt unsettling, and therefore all the more human and real.  My only beef?  The novel feels slight compared to some of the others (254 pages never felt so thin), but then perhaps it is because the action is concentrated into a few short days where the fate of Rome, and Gordianus' family, hangs in the balance.  My greatest pleasure?  With an ending like this, you know there's going to be another Gordianus tale...can't wait!	2001-08-31
US	52124316	R1J6QARGDW9Z1K	0848818768	872664967	Summer	Books	5	28	29	N	N	Brilliant Tale of First Love Won and Lost	Written when Wharton's own marriage was failing, this tale of first love won and lost is a bittersweet, moving novel which melds Wharton's two worlds beautifully - high society, and rural New England. Her personal favorite of all the novels she wrote, Edith Wharton captures the very essence of love and longing in this beautiful, sensual story of Charity Royall and Lucius Harney. Born to a poor mother, Mr. Royall rescues Charity and raises her as his own daughter, but when his wife dies of consumption, and Charity begins to ripen into a lovely woman, Mr. Royal realizes that his feelings for her are deeper than he imagined. Repulsed by his offer of marriage, Charity instead turns her attentions to the handsome young architect from Boston, Mr. Lucius Harney, who is visiting North Dormer for the summer. As summer unfurls in North Dormer like the Red Rambler rose in Charity's garden, Charity and Lucius' love blossoms, burns hot, and spills over into sexual union. Wharton's language of love is extraordinary - beautiful, sensual, and filled with all the fire of first love. I won't ruin the ending for you by revealing it, but it is poignant, achingly human, and ultimately fitting that Charity ends up where she does. Bittersweet and gorgeously written, this is a magical book not to be missed.	2001-08-27

My two-year old recently became hooked, and I have now had the exquisite pleasure of revisiting &quot;Chicken Soup with Rice&quot;, &quot;One was Johnny&quot;, &quot;Pierre&quot;, and &quot;Alligators All Around&quot; on a regular basis. With the same arch humor and sly drawings that Sendak brought to &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, the four books in the Nutshell Library entertain as they instruct. The rhyming pattern makes it very easy to memorize (I've gotten to be a whiz at reading in semi-darkness circa bedtime...) - in fact, my daughter can &quot;read&quot; almost all of &quot;Chicken Soup with Rice&quot; now by associating the rhymes with the pictures. This collection is a rarity in children's books - it's fun for both kids and parents! Plus, it easily fits into a purse or diaper bag to take along on trips - whether to the supermarket, or Grandma's. And the kid-sized volumes are a delight for small hands. DON'T MISS IT!	2001-08-24

Buck, and this is one of my all time favorites. Buck's lucid writing, and deep understanding of complex cultural issues makes this a gem. Set against the back-drop of the Chinese cultural Revolution, THE THREE DAUGHTERS OF MADAME LIANG charts the deeply personal journey and loss of one Chinese family. There is a sophistication to Buck's writing that is not always immediately apparent, but once you become used to her voice, the deceptively simple prose gives way to deeply moving insights. This is a glowing, powerful novel about a family and a country at a crossroads. Don't miss it!	2001-08-24

Anita Diamant brilliantly captures the texture of Biblical times through the eyes of the wives and daughter of the founding father of the nation of Israel: Jacob. Dinah, the forgotten daughter of Jacob who narrates this extraordinary tale, grows up in the shadow of her famous brothers, but as the only daughter of the clan, she becomes the repository for her female kin's stories, carrying their legacy forward into a future that is at once horrifying, and uplifting.<br />I have rarely been as moved by a book as I was by THE RED TENT;  I have never felt any connection to my Jewish heritage until I read this book. My father's family are descendants of the Levite tribe of Israel, and as I read Dinah's extraordinary story, I felt as if I were reading about my own ancestors.  And this is where Diamant really shines - beyond the mere historical facts of this tale lies a deeper, more profound truth: we are all the sum total of our ancestors, and each of us is responsible for carrying their stories and spirit into the future.  Or as Diamant more eloquently puts it, &quot;There is no magic to immortality...Egypt loved the lotus because it never dies. It is the same for people who are loved.  Thus can something as insignificant as a name - two syllables, one high, one sweet - summon up the innumerable smiles and tears, sighs and dreams of a human life.&quot;<br />THE RED TENT is the ineffably moving tale of an extraordinary life.	2001-08-21

(OOPS - SORRY, THIS ACTUALLY REFERS TO &quot;ARMS OF NEMESIS&quot; - MY BAD...) O.k., I'll admit it: I love Gordianus the Finder. Forget Marcus Didius Falco (of Lindsay Davis fame), Gordianus is the only man in Rome for me. Pegged as a &quot;finder&quot;, Gordianus ferrets out the truth about scandals, mysteries, murders and more. In this lively tale set against the Spartacan slave revolt, the lives of 100 slaves hang in the balance while Gordianus tries to untangle a gordian knot of a murder. The master of the house is murdered, and two slaves are implicated. Every slave in the household will be put to death in the gladiator's ring unless Gordianus finds out the real truth. I love that Saylor takes Gordianus out of Rome, into the pleasure villas of the idle Roman rich, and gives us a tantalizing glimpse into yet another facet of Roman life. All of Saylor's novels are gorgeously researched, and the writing crackles with humor and menace in equal measures. Beware: once bitten by the Gordianus bug, you'll be hooked for life...	2001-08-20

Thanks to Elizabeth Taylor and Claudette Colbert before her, we have been swamped with images and myths about the woman and her men.  Falconer has written a sumptuous (though I suspect less than totally accurate historically) tale of the woman who nearly brought Rome to its knees.  Most fascinating to me was the less than reverent depiction of Mark Antony, and a glimpse inside the corridors of power in both Rome and Egypt at that time.  The details are exquisite - from Antony and Cleopatra's first meeting to their sensual couplings, to the final drama which claimed their lives - Falconer conjures a world where one strong woman almost toppled an empire.  A great summer/beach read, just don't take it too seriously as far as history goes.	2001-08-20

He is smart, has remarkably human foibles, assembles a rag-tag family from orphans and ex-slaves, and the reputation of being the &quot;last honest man in Rome&quot;.  I have read all of Steven Saylor's delightful Roma Sub Rosa series featuring Gordianus, and found this tale of murder and mayhem to be a fine addition to the collection.  What I love about Saylor's gorgeously researched and highly readable tales is they truly bring history to life.  We get a taste for what life was really like in Rome in the 1st century - what they ate, how they worshipped, the tangled nature of politics, and the struggles of every day Joe's like Gordianus to survive as the Roman Republic's death throws begin.  Characters we have come to know from previous novels (no, you don't have to have read them to like this), lend an air of familiarity to this tale, deepending our feelings for them and what happens.  Take a walk down the Appian Way, and you'll be hooked on this stellar series.	2001-08-20

I knew virtually nothing about Alcibiades when I began this, and by the end (I admit, I kept putting it down and picking it back up again) I, too, was a fan of this maddeningly charismatic, visionary military genius, who was revered and hated by his own people (often at the same time).<br />Pressfield writes some of the most vivid, breathtaking, terrifying battle scenes ever recorded, and the final image of the book is at once lyrical and ominous.  The speeches of Alcibiades are worth the price of the book by themselves (it's too bad Pressfield didn't write the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot; - it would have been a lot more interesting).  While much of the book is uneven, and Pressfield's style sometimes gets in the way of the story, much of the book is stirring and brilliant; and well worth the effort of reading.	2001-08-20

How could you not?  He's wise, witty, occasionally cranky, and always believably human.  And, he holds the rare reputation of being the last honest man in Rome.  In this tale of murder on the shores of Baie, Steven Saylor takes our favorite Finder to the pleasure villas of the Roman rich, showing us yet another fascinating facet of Roman life in the 1st century.  The overseer of Marcus Crassus' villa is murdered just as the Spartacan slave revolt is heating up, and two slaves are implicated.  Gordianus must find out the truth before all 100 household slaves are put to death in the gladiator's ring. Like all of Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series, this is gorgeously researched and written.

The back-drop is spectacular - Rome is on the brink of civil war, with Julius Caesar's troops having crossed the Rubicon into Northern Italy to meet Pompey the Great's forces amassed in the south of Italy.  Rome is a shambles, a city on the brink of utter dissolution, and amidst the atrocities about to blossom, Pompey's nephew is strangled in Gordianus' own house. The solution of this particular mystery takes on enormously personal import for Gordianus and his family.  And it's a really, really, fun ride...but, I have to quibble with one point - while I know that the fun of these novels is really the characters (who are rich, funny, crass, and totally alive), and the vivid historical setting, not the mystery per se - the resolution of this one felt like a cheat.  To the author's credit, out of the 6 Gordianus books I've read, this is the only one that doesn't feel like it resolves believably.  But it is still a grand read - as much for the development of the characters I have come to know and love from the other books in the series.  I applaud Saylor for allowing his characters to age believably, and to grow and change with time.  I can't wait to read &quot;Last Seen in Massilia&quot;.  Note to Steven Saylor: Write faster!	2001-08-18

I have read nearly all of the Roma Sub Rosa series featuring the wonderfully human, intelligent, and dedicated Gordianus, and come to think of him almost as an extended family member.  For other Gordianus-aholics, this  collection of stories nicely fills in the gaps left in the longer novels - finally we find out all about the night Catilina raped a Vestal...or did he?  We hear Gordianus' sexy, sassy slave (now wife) tell tales of her native Alexandria, and we learn all about Lucius.  But the best part of this collection is you need no previous experience with Gordianus to have a rollicking good time.  As Gordianus winds through the streets of ancient Rome, exposing frauds, murderers, and thieves, you will be caught up in the spell Saylor's crisp writing always weaves.  Warning:  clear some shelf space.  Once you're hooked on Gordianus, you'll want to read them all.	2001-08-12

Ever since I read ROMAN BLOOD, I've been a confirmed Gordianus-aholic.  But I gotta tell you, this is one of the best yet.  Saylor takes a notorious character from history, and not only brings him vividly to life, but makes you like the guy, and feel sorry that he's gotten such bad press for the last two thousand years.  While less strictly a &quot;mystery&quot; than some of the other Roma Sub Rosa series with the ever fascinating Gordianus the Finder, CATILINA'S RIDDLE is no less compelling for its lucid tale of Roman politics gone horribly awry, and one of the most moving battle scenes ever written (or filmed).

Certain events are riveting (Alexias running and winning the long race, Lysis fighting and losing a wrestling match at the same games), others humdrum (the telling of Alcibiades' restoration to favor after defeating the Oligarchs left me longing for Steven Pressfield's infinitely better &quot;The Tides of War&quot;).  I think there are better, more vivid tales out there covering the same ground. Renault's writing feels a bit dated, and the central relationship of the book (Alexias and Lysis are described constantly as &quot;lovers&quot;, yet the details of whether or not they actually physically consummate their homosexual relationship are left ludicrously vague) never fully gels.  Still, the historical details are rich, and there are brilliant moments peppered throughout.	2001-07-27

This is a hypnotic tale, languid, dream-like and erotic.

Saylor's impeccable research, and mellifluous writing style make these books a pleasure to read.  Knowing that the events are based on actual historical cases adds to the fun.  (Too bad Saylor didn't get to write the screenplay for &quot;Gladiator&quot; - it would have been a lot more fun.)  Gordianus is a wonderful gum-shoe, far more real and relatable than Lindsay Davis' Marcus Didius Falco.  Saylor's books are also fresher for being based on actual events.

Deceptively simple in style and execution, Tsukiyama's lyrical prose weaves a spell that is almost impossible to cast off.  Like a Japanese watercolor, The Samurai's Garden is as much about the spaces inbetween its characters as the events which motivate them.  Set against the back-drop of impending war, a young man is sent from China to recover from TB at his family's summer home in Japan.  There he learns of his father's extramarital affair, and is born as an artist with the gruff but ineffably wise influence of his father's servant (the &quot;samurai&quot; of the title), whose own life holds some surprising revelations.

I suffered for weeks with post-partum  depression, and found enormous comfort in Barrett's accounts of other mom's  journeys; for the first time I realized I was not alone.  Barrett  interviewed dozens of women from all walks of life about their experiences  pre and post labor, and their honest account of their feelings about birth,  sex, and returning to work are pearls of wisdom for a new mom.  I cannot  recommend this spectacular book highly enough.	1999-10-26
