Domesticated by the Aztecs for use as a coloring agent, the cochineal insect (Dactylopius coccus) was a frail species of scale that fed on the nopal cactus. The Spanish conquistadors that invaded Mexico in the 1500's initially were ignorant of the huge economic impact that cochineal dye could have for them personally and for the Spanish empire but Spanish merchants eventually made cochineal one of the dominant economic exports from the New World. The secrecy surrounding cochineal production and the frail nature of the insect kept the highly desired dye in the hands of the Spanish empire until the nineteenth century when Mexican independence and exports of insects to a couple of countries with favorable growing conditions caused the loss of the monopoly. In the interim, the huge demand for the dye resulted in significant international conflict and intrigue. The market for cochineal collapsed after the Germans patented red dyes derived from coal tar chemistry but its legacy lives on. For example, Rembrandt's \\"The Jewish Bride\\" was painted with cochineal pigment instead of paints such as Alizarin crimson that have largely supplanted it. The author is to be highly commended for the quality of the scholarship and the excellent writing.	2005-09-28

Considering the wide spectrum of views on intellectual property rights, it is no surprise that the category as a whole encompasses very different positions on how much protection intellectual property deserves and how best to protect it. The two major strengths of this book are its well articulated viewpoints and the strong writing. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I discovered that the book was not going to be a dry academic tome but instead incorporates about 200 years of the history of global intellectual property theft and enforcement that helps you place the issues in context with real-world events. The book mostly covers patent issues and presents cause for concern about the risk of the United States shifting into decline as it loses both the fruits of its inventiveness and the intellectual capital to sustain it. The only part I did not like was the last twenty to thirty pages which takes an anti-copyright view that favors restricted rights and enhanced bureaucratic formalities to maintain them.  Irrespective of whether you agree with the author, this is an important book and one of the better written ones on the subject.	2005-08-25

Professor Norman hits on a theme that far-too-often passes over the heads of techno-geeks and even those designers who are more considerate about how human psychology plays a role in making objects easy to use. This theme basically recognizes that humans are more adept at using objects that incorporate positive elements such as fun, nostalgia, and excitement. It also explains why some supposedly functional elements detract from the usability of objects. For example, auditory signals can provide useful information, but don't you get tired of all the things that beep at you. Pavlov's dogs salivated at the sound of the bell, but how many people salivate when a microwave oven beeps? Likewise, `57 Land Rovers are underpowered, noisy, bumpy, sans radio, cumbersome to fuel, and equipped with an electrical system that favors ready access to a fire extinguisher. They are also great fun to drive. If there are objects in your life that you love even though they seem to break the rules of logic, or objects that you loathe even though they have features that are seemingly useful, this book will help to explain why.	2005-08-09

For example, laws giving the government power to curtail political assassinations were abused by Stalin and Hitler to consolidate their dictatorships. This book covers the issues and personalities involved in the courtroom battle over whether the United States would adopt the British doctrine of constructive treason in which merely thinking that it would be desirable to have the King killed would be sufficient grounds for capital punishment. Jefferson, who intensely disliked his former vice-president Burr, sought to press treason charges for an alleged plan to cause the western regions to sucede from the United States. Faced with shaky evidence, the prosecutors urged that the Constitution be interpreted to enable them to convict Burr on the basis of constructive treason. The book cogently describes the societal and personal issues at stake, and how Chief Justice Marshall navigated the intense political and judicial issues involved in the grand jury proceeding and trial. The author does an excellent job of setting the matter in its historical context and does so in a very readable style.	2005-07-06

This book provides an interesting view into the lives of college football coaches as they deal with the weekly challenges of analyzing last week's game, preparing for the next, recruiting high school players, and dealing with the media. All the teams feature accomplished coaches at big-name programs but there is a fair amount of variation into how they relate to their players, their general outlooks on life, even their spirituality. Each week covers a major game, and many fans of college football are likely to have watched at least one or two of them. If you want to get a feel for what happens behind the scenes in college football, this book is about as good as it gets.	2005-03-14

There are several excellent books on how to prepare book proposals and I have made it a practice to read them as they come out. Each of these books feature their authors' imprimaturs and tend to be suited to individual writers depending on their proclivities. This book is comprehensive in all the areas of preparing a book proposal but is particularly strong in the area that the majority of writers are weakest - thinking their concept through before preparing and submitting the proposal. About one-third of the book is devoted to figuring out what you want to say, how you are going to say it, and how you are going to express the book concept in the proposal. Having reviewed hundreds of book proposals, my opinion is that the aspect of not thinking the project through is the factor that accounts for most rejections. There were a couple of areas in which I somewhat disagree with the author: (1) I feel that the sample chapter should almost always be from the middle of the book because using a introductory chapter does not show how the writer will handle the meat of the book, and (2) I feel that chapter summaries should always be done in a narrative style because excerpts don't get to the point and bulleted lists are basically a power point approach to a selling a non-power point product. Nonetheless, the author has been published many times more than I have and what he says carries weight.	2005-03-14

In my legal practice I run into countless clients whose problems could have been easily and quickly resolved had they treated the other parties with respect and empathetic communication. Too many people think that anger, put downs, unreasonable demands, and exasperation are the ways to convince other people to see things their way. Although commonsense tells you that this isn't true, the numerous examples in this book reveal the subtle ways that most people fall into at least a few communication traps. This is a more a book about respectful communication than on how to persuade people but it has very valuable content that can be applied to resolve common kinds of disputes that don't really justify spending large sums on legal fees.	2005-02-24

A lot of people who want to become writers and screenwriters approach the business with great intentions but naive expectations. The publishing and film industries do offer genuine opportunities for new entrants but due to the heavy workloads of editors, agents, and producers, they are quite demanding in what writers must deliver to warrant serious consideration. This book presents many of the \\"brutal truths\\" about the business in an honest but not cynical way that many books about entering the business either gloss over or ignore altogether. Furthermore, learning these truths can help writers understand the high level of craftsmanship required to break into the industry as well as the machinations that underlie the process of getting published. Some of truths in this book are so brutal you are unlikely to see them discussed at length in other writing books. Examples include writing instructors who are woefully inadequate, that retaining an editing service won't necessarily enhance your chances of having a publishable product, and sleeping with an editor, agent, producer, or big-name author is unlikely to result in a deal. However, some of the truths are not so brutal. For example, being a genuinely nice person who is not out to manipulate every contact or constantly seeking favors can pay off in the long run. Ms. Niles was very helpful to me during two Willamette Writers conferences and when I learned that she had written this book, I couldn't wait to buy it and post a review on Amazon. The publishing world is not really a mean and nasty place but it helps to know the pitfalls in the landscape. Reading this lively book is a much more enjoyable way to learn how to overcome the obstacles than stumbling into them.	2005-01-27

Changes in the area of intellectual property protection in recent years, particularly regarding the practices of the US Patent and Trademark Office, have blurred the lines of protection in some areas of the law. The art and entertainment areas are good examples where the changes have had the most effect and practitioners in those fields are well advised to become familiar with them. The book clearly describes some of the most ambiguous areas and does an excellent job of describing why and when some forms of intellectual property protection may be more suitable than others. It also deals concretely with the issue of costs and - egads - when someone might actually want to retain an attorney. My quibbles with the book are minor. Patent infringement cases do not necessarily cost $500,000 to prosecute and many cases involving inventions with modest commercial success are resolved at much less cost. Also, in terms of the efficacy of protection, nothing beats a timely registered copyright in terms of recovery for time and cost expended. But these are my opinions and others may (and probably do) disagree. In any case, the candid and practical guidance in this book will be of interest to anyone working in the creative fields irrespective of whether they have invented new ways to create art, designed bigger and better inflatable dolls, or developed new designs for clothing and accessories.	2004-11-17

He describes the development of technologies in conjunction with the training and treatment of the men in different navies at different times and shows the ramifications in selected battles. One aspect that make this book particularly interesting is that the author discusses the inner machinations of the Tsarist, WWI German and British, WWII Japanese, and post-WWII Soviet navies; material that has not been comprehensively and collectively covered in other books. Another aspect is the author's selection of the battles to show how naval warfare occurred in practice. Instead of focusing only on the battles that were strategic turning points, the author uses examples that show the problems of changing technology and organization presented to navies and the adjustments that were made. For example, the rapid evolution of aviation in naval warfare during WWII is shown in the battles of Crete, Santa Cruz (Solomon Islands), the Mariannas, and Okinawa. The book does not purport to be an extensive documentary of naval history but rather shows how and why it changed. It is particularly recommended for readers who want a better understanding of the practical effects of the human element in naval warfare.	2004-04-07

The basic premise of the book is that modern art has lost touch with modern audiences because it has little to say that is relevant to people. With too many artists seeking to capitalize on shock value, \\"statements\\" about non-art as art, and making the artist into the center of attention, modern art is becoming a backwater where people will say they like some works even though they love none of them. Some good points about the book are its questioning whether modern art is even trying to reflect the current times and whether much of what is called art is even art at all. I disagree with some of the author's contentions such as his statement that photography is merely a mechanical process (frankly, it is far more difficult to get perfect tonalities in a photograph than it is to assemble a bull's head from bicycle parts even though the creative visions may be similar) but attribute this to his lack of familiarity with that medium. This book expresses a thoughtful perspective and makes you think. This alone warrants the five star rating. Also, the book contains no graphic nudity even though the author asserts that the emperor is wearing no clothes.	2004-01-17

Each chapter is about an individual aspect of black and white photography such as format, grain, and enlargement. Each chapter begins with a rambling obtuse anecdote that somehow (and with great finesse) leads into the subject of the chapter. This book has a literary style that is sorely lacking in most \\"how to do photography\\" books (including my own). The key to reading the book is to take what is said in stride and enjoy the ride. I found it to be a fun book to read.<br />The book reflects a fascinating \\"left-brain right-brain' mindset that is very much into quantified experimentation yet with an wholesome appreciation of aesthetics. Even if you don't agree with everything that is said, the book will probably motivate you to put a lot more reflection and thought in how you approach monochrome photography. Grainier is sharper? How can that be? Oh, I see. <br />Sadly, Mr. Thornton passed away unexpectedly in October 2003. This is a great loss to those who like reading photography books since he had much more to say. In any case, Edge of Darkness is a great legacy to a very thoughtful man.	2004-01-17

The works are both varied and well done and the commentary is interesting without being overwhelming. If you enjoy looking at how artists portray similar concepts in different ways, you should like this book. I take issue with the reviewer who wrote the review for Library Journal. He is correct that Hidden Symbols in Art is not a book that is directed towards an academic audience. If you are looking for over-intellectualized commentary on works depicted with mediocre-to-poor illustrations, you should stick with the books he recommends. If you are the kind of person who views art for baser reasons (e.g., enjoyment), this one would be a good addition to your collection.	2003-10-23

This book deals with the power of accusations, in combination with dubious expert testimony, to undermine a person's right to a fair hearing and result in the incarceration of innocent individuals. It focuses on some of the most public sex abuse prosecutions during the 1980's and 1990's and shows how justice was subverted by a combination of overzealous \\"experts,\\" unfair limitations on the defendants' ability to present exculpatory evidence, and the vagaries of the appeals process. These cases, and particularly the Wenatchee prosecutions, are about as close as American justice has come to the Kangaroo courts of the former Soviet Union. <br />One of the book's strong points is its explanations of how so called experts spend weeks coercing children to accuse adults that they had been sexually abused relying on the principle that a child who denies such events occurred is necessarily repressing their memory and a child that makes the accusation is telling the truth. In such a case, no accused person can ever be cleared. Readers interested in this issue might also want to look at Whores of the Court by Margaret Hagen. It also shows how prosecutors used the experts to present testimony that what the children said was true and how judges limited cross-examination and rebuttal evidence on the grounds that it was bad for the children. The book also offers some eye-opening detail on the limits of the appeals process to correct injustices. <br />The book could have been better had it gone into more depth on the viewpoints of the prosecutors and their experts. It also could have benefitted from a more detailed discussion of the kinds of testimony that occurs in bona fide sexual abuse cases. However, these shortcomings do not detract significantly from the major premise that in somecases the political and social weight given to an accusation can deprive patently innocent people of their right to justice.	2003-09-24

A retired surgeon, he plans to stage a gunshot accident while hunting for birds in the Yakima Valley which is \\"east of the mountains\\" from Seattle where he lives. He spends three days in the valley where he grew up as a boy during which he confronts other issues about life and death and reflects on some of the important events in his life while growing up. This is a thoughtful novel that speaks volumes regarding the value of life and how individuals affect the lives of others.<br /> It is interesting to see how other people have reacted to this book in light of the success of \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" Second novels tend to be judged harshly, especially when people have expectations that the next book will somehow be the same as or a continuation of the first. \\"East of the Mountains\\" has a different premise and explores different issues than \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" Instead of dealing with issues of cultural expectations and community values, \\"East of the Mountains\\" is about personal fulfillment and the value of life. Ironically, despite the pallor of loss, it ultimately expresses more about hope than \\"Snow Falling on Cedars.\\" Readers who can accept this book as its own work will find it to be a profound and carefully crafted story.	2003-07-14

It tells the story of a Marine from his formative days as a boxer at Notre Dame to serving in several roles as a lieutenant colonel during the first part of the Korean Conflict. Brady's novels about the Corps always feature some unusual historical elements and this one has more than the others. The main character faces different kinds of issues than the those in the other Brady novels. For example, while his career progresses nicely, ironically it is haunted by serving a span as a young officer in Carlson's Raiders (an elite unit viewed with suspicion by many cadre). The book gives a good feel for the various conflicts it describes and for the career of the bachelor Marine officer.	2003-06-09

There are several ways to judge a book and three of them that apply to this book are its readability, new information, and insight. Gina Kolata writes clearly and does an excellent job mixing history, journalism, science, and personal experience. The book provides great information about the origins of many beliefs about fitness and how they have changed over time. It also shows how ambiguous modern knowledge about fitness really is. Finally, the book provides insight into things such as why some people are exercise junkies and other quit after a couple of months, why some people experience exercise euphoria and others don't, and the simple fact that bodies respond differently to exercise. The chapter regarding the fitness industry was revealing in a manner similar to Schlosser's Fast Food Nation and the chapters regarding the \\"Mt.

Book writers tend to come in three categories: (1) the unpublished who lament about how difficult it is to get published, (2) the newly published (and midlist authors) who lament about how little publishers do to promote their books, and (3) the wildly successful who lament about their taxes. This book is just the ticket for writers who are in or about to enter Category 2. It explains the realities of how publishers allocate their publicity resources and how to make the most of what they give you. It also gives you realistic guidance on how to get publicity for your own book ranging from hiring a publicist, arranging for events personally, and media training. It covers everything from the little leagues such as getting a story into the local weekly (easy) to the big leagues such as getting on Oprah (really hard). This is a genuinely solid book written by an industry professional who achieved miracles when she was promoting her own book.

Less often mentioned, is her skill at developing the secondary characters in her works and how well she incorporates them into the plots. Braided World is loaded with intrigue at many levels as over a dozen characters deal with the issues of personal power, changing societies, duty, loyalty, and tolerance. The remarkable part of the novel is how clearly it depicts these issues without getting bogged down or becoming confusing. Although the book is founded on the scenario described in Kenyon's prior novel, Maximum Ice, the characters and setting are completely different. If you are getting bored with science fiction that features mostly a lot of whiz-bang and golly-gee, and want to read something that is exciting but a bit more literary, The Braided World is highly recommended.	2003-03-24

In fact, many people give too much credibility to photographs because they assume that photographs always present scenes realistically.  Mr. Brugioni shows not only how easily photographs are altered to distort the truth, he also conveys an idea of how widespread the practice of photo manipulation is in the modern media.

In England, she is bounced around from school to school until finally settling in London.  She deals with coming of age during a time when she did not know the fate of her parents, was forced to move from residence to residence during the bombing and V-1 attacks on London, and grieved over the deaths of young expatriot friends who had volunteered to to fight against the Nazis.  At the end of the war, she makes an ironic return to Berlin and Prague where she first experiences the effects that the Cold War will have on the remainder of her life.  The author also manages to subtly but profoundly provide a testament to the courage of her parents.<br />Displaced persons constituted a large body of people affected by World War II and have continued to do so in the wars since.  Farewell to Prague is one of the best accounts of what it is like to experience the anger and insecurity of leaving one's home and never being able to regain one's previous sense of community.  This is an excellent book for adults who want to understand the importance of perseverance in the face of bitterness and loneliness.  The book would make an excellent gift for teenagers who would benefit from learning to appreciate what they have in life.	2003-01-14

Some of the areas it covers particularly well are the importance of credentials and presentation. However, it provides solid information in all the important areas.  It takes more time to read this book than the others on the topic but the time is well spent.  Editors and agents are always impressed by book proposals that are informative, succinct, and well prepared and following the guidelines in this book will help you prepare an impressive proposal.  Prospective writers often ask me to recommend books on writing book proposals and there are several that I recommend depending on the writer's temperament.  I am always encouraged when writers select this one because the level of commitment usually reflects a quality proposal. <br />Note: Beginning in December 2002, the book is published by a new publisher. The proofing issues that inadvertently slipped through the cracks with the second edition have been corrected( e.g., chapter 14 is now included in the table of contents).	2002-12-15

If you are a person who gets gets irritated (or loses it) over stimuli that other people seem to tolerate without difficulty, or if you know such a person, then this is the book for you. While other books address the issue of sensory integration in children, this is the only book that I know of that addresses sensory defensiveness as a problem in adults. Among the many strongpoints of the book are its discussions about how sensory defensiveness can be misdiagnosed as other disorders, what it is like to live with sensory defensiveness, and how to improve the ability to cope. The only bad thing about the book is that the five-color dust jacket is a little on the busy side (although not nearly as horrible as the blinking colon signs you see on some digital clocks). Of course, you always have the option of removing the dust jacket. Thank you Dr. Heller.	2002-12-04

The chapter about the elements that make up a book proposal are sound although not as extensive as they could be. The examples of query letters and proposals are excellent. I found the sections on writing the book to be less useful but sound. Other writers may find them very helpful. The book is graced with some wonderful quotes. One of my favorites - by Patrick Dennis - is \\"Writing isn't hard. It isn't any harder than ditch-digging.\\"	2002-09-24
US	42886491	R3L9DQM8LZZZJ4	1586480421	873402511	The Special Prisoner	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Short but Thoughtful	This is a book about how a former POW in World war II deals with the permanent injuries incurred during his incarceration in Japan. At the age of seventy, while in an airport, he sees the man who relentlessly tortured him 50 years earlier and impulsively seeks him out. Although this book is not long as novels go, it deals with complex issues of good vs. evil, murder vs. justifiable killing, and forgiveness vs. vengenance. The writing is well researched, interesting, and thoughtful.	2002-09-09

It wisely provides guidance on how to avoid or retreat from potentially bad situations and likewise has a frank but practical discussion on the merits of self defense on the trail.  It does not hype the crime that happens on trails and at campgrounds which is good and bad.  Good in that it does not try to present the outdoors as a &quot;war zone&quot; but bad in that more stories about bad situations would provide readers with more guidance on how things go wrong and how to avoid bad situations.	2002-07-30

I was mistaught about the Coriolis effect and how water drains differently in the northern and southern hemispheres in elementary school and did not have this corrected until recently.  The author's explanation of the tides is the very best that I have read (except for one thing: Hey Phil, how come there is only one high tide and one low tide per day along the Gulf Coast?).  The chapter on astronomy in the movies was a lot of fun to read.  This book is popular science at its very best.	2002-07-14

Among the useful aspects of the book are the photographs that show how control over the exposure and printing can affect the final result. This book is perfect for photographers looking to make a serious advance in the quality of their images.	2002-06-27

I thought the book was well written and the author does an excellent job of presenting the war from the perspective someone who was neither privileged nor publicly known.  Irwin does a good job of describing combat as well as other aspects such as the relationships with other soldiers and how they dealt with fear.	2002-06-11

The book is the story of a small group of Marines in China led by a young officer who escape through the &quot;back door&quot; just after Pearl Harbor.  Brady, a former Marine officer, captures the daring of the Marines as they use their initiative under difficult and changing circumstances.	2002-05-25
US	42886491	RUU07MN4VGASG	0312280815	27213501	The Marines of Autumn: A Novel of the Korean War	Books	5	0	2	N	N	You can feel the cold.	I am the son of a career Marine and one of my memories of childhood is the murals inside the movie theatre at MCAS New River.  I knew little about the Korean War when I was seven but I vividly remember seeing the mural depicting Marines at the Chosin Reservoir and understanding how tough they really were.  I really like James Brady as an author and he does a very good job in showing the cold and fatigue the combatants endured during the campaign.  The strongpoints of the book are its character development and the descriptions of the environment as Winter approaches.  This book may not appeal to fans of template thrillers but as a novel of man vs. man vs. nature it is an excellent work.	2002-05-18

The author selects several disasters and analyses the technical and psychological factors that caused them.  Although names are named and mistakes are identified as such, the book is objective and does not cast participants as stupid or slovenly (mostly) as some books are prone to do.  Instead, it provides thoughtful insights into how even seemingly qualified and concerned people make errors that lead to accidents.  I particularly liked the guidance for people who work or live around potentially dangerous environments.	2002-05-11

It starts with his introduction at a green infantry officer to departing as an intelligence officer.  The excellent narrative describes what it was like to serve in different parts of Korea in different seasons.	2002-03-25

It garners your interest at the very beginning and the plot keeps unfolding throughout the book. One of the more interesting aspects is how the environment (the \\"ice\\") is both a realm and also a character of sorts. The book is well paced and exciting. Hollywood take note -- this would make a great movie.	2002-02-18

This is one of the shorter books on how to write a book proposal but the advice is very sound.  Following the guidance in the book should result in an excellent proposal.  One thing that distinguishes this book from most others on the subject is that it is written from a publishers perspective.  If you are interested in writing a serious proposal,it  would not be a bad idea to read more than one book on the topic since a proposal that looks professional and provides the information an editor considers necessary will garner extra attention.	2002-02-14

The style and organization are excellent and the information is useful to anyone who wants to improve the mental functioning of themselves or their growing children. It has changed the way I approach my piano lessons and has already improved my 8-year old daughter's skill at chess (I have to pay attention now if I want to win).	2001-12-06

Books	5	4	4	N	N	An Excellent Resource	Getting published can be difficult or relatively easy depending on what you write about and how well you do it. When seeking a publisher or agent, it is important to know who is interested in the kind of material you are writing and the best way to present your idea to them. This book is the best source of information about the personal preferences and tastes of individual editors and agents. It may not provide as many listings as Writer's Market but the quality is much higher. It also provides information about how to prepare queries and proposals although I recommend that a writer who is new to the process get one of the books that deal specifically with preparing book proposals. The real value of this book is the information it provides regarding who to contact in the publishing industry.	2001-10-31

I enjoyed the way the characters face almost hopeless situations and cope in different ways with several kinds of changing physical and political environments.  It always feels good to read science fiction where the plot and character development equal or exceed the attention giving to creating the &quot;other world.&quot;  This author is very skillful at both.	2001-08-18
