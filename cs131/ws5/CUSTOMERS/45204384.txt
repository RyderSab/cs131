On one trip, he encountered a man who gave him a phone number and told him he could make it through. Thus began the odyssey of Adam Ballinger in joining the 21 SAS of Britains' Territorial Army, roughly equivalent to the Reserves in the US.<br /><br />To get into the unit, Ballinger faced a Selection just as rigorous as that of the 22 (active duty) SAS, but was required to maintain his own fitness when not meeting every weekend. Ballinger is required to go through this and at the same time worry about his girlfriend/fianc&eacute; and his job. He finds that the number of those who make it exceedingly few, and those that do have problems in their civilian lives from spending so much of their time maintaining their conditioning and meeting every weekend for 48+ hours, often required to spend a week undergoing training at a time then slip back into their lives without telling anyone what they are doing.<br /><br />Ballinger is an educated man who arrives with a job, a girlfriend, and not knowing what he is getting himself into, and finishes a man with a tenuous hold on his job, a fianc&eacute; he doesn't get to see much of and still not understanding what has driven him to keep going, while others either quit or were sent packing. Some of his fellows have military backgrounds, some, including himself, do not. Ultimately, all who partake in the experience are changed by it and that is where Ballinger shines. He describes the changes in himself and those around him through the grueling process of selection, which he describes in detail.	2005-08-16

This text is meant for introductory courses and for that purpose it is tolerable. Nevertheless, it is long-winded, dull and poorly written. Also, because it is meant to be used for an introductory overview course, most of the material will most likely be used during lectures. The truth is, this book was the \\"required reading\\" for a course I took. Our Professor was most likely required to assign a textbook and she picked this one, and never assigned us to read any of it. I read parts before exams in order to try to fill in any gaps from our lectures, but this book is a waste of time and money if not necessary for carrying out assignments.	2005-08-04

While it is part of a series, it is perfectly able to stand on it's own. Using historical research and a talent for the literary art, Spears tells the story of two peoples, the Greeks in Constantinople and the Saracens who when we meet them are laying siege to Constantinople, the Capital of the Greek Byzantine Empire.<br /><br />Storming the walls proves to difficult despite repeated attempts, so a naval blockade to starve the Greeks into submission is launched. The blockading ships encounter a devastating weapon when the Greeks appear.

Spears Jr. wrote this book as the first in a series of three novels based on Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Spears tells the story of how Christianity triumphs in the Empire through and man and woman who despite their relative wealth and station, he is a Rhetoritician and she is of the Senatorial class, convert to Christianity. In the course of the lives, the two meet, fall in love, convert (although not in a simple smooth process) to a religion that is illegal to practice and travel throughout the Empire. From Athens, to Rome, Asia Minor, Alexandria, Gaul and more, these two meet, befriend and make enemies of many people. Their change is the change of an Empire from at least nominally Pagan to Christian. Culminating at the time of Constantine's Conquest of Rome, this tale shows how Spears knew how to write about people and history. Being tremendously historically accurate, while at the same time telling the human story of conversion to a new religion that seemed foreign and silly only years earlier. If you can get hold of a copy, I recommend reading it. I hope this series is reprinted at some point in the future.	2005-04-13

When Frederick wrote this book, he was still the crown prince of Prussia and stationed at an army post waiting for his father to die. It was at this point in his life that Frederick furthered his education by reading on his own.<br /><br />His Refutation of Machiavelli's Prince, has one main problem, it fails to understand the context in which Machiavelli was writing. It almost appears that Frederick assumes Machiavelli to be one of his contemporaries and interperets Machiavelli's analyses to be attacks on kingship (contemporary to Frederick in the form of absolute monarchy) itself. Frederick, attempting to refute Machiavelli, line by line, chapter by chapter often devolves into long rants against points Frederick, more often than not, has misinterpereted. In doing so, Frederick loses one of the great advantages of the Prince, he doesn't keep his work short.<br /><br />Frederick does have several redeeming virtues in his critique. Among them that he has attempted to show the potential for abuse of the Prince which could be used for. He shows also the feeling among those who believed in monarchy about Machiavelli. He demonstrates a passion for the subject.	2005-03-10

Instead, what I found was an author who tried to find as much information on military psychological research and covers it all. From discovering what British soldiers would work hardest for in the 50s (more pay? college?) to some of the darker stories that have become counterculture fodder for decades. What Watson did was simply to dig up as much information as possible, distill it and present it to the layman without prejudice.	2004-06-26

With that said, read it anyway. Gasset wrote something as contemporary today as it was in the 1920s and 30s. Operating on the premise that we have seen since Thucydides, that the mass of citizens, when unchecked does damage, does not consider the consequences of its actions, its demands, its lifestyle without understanding or thinking about the system of civilisation which makes their relatively free and prosperous lives possible.<br />\\"It is false to say that history cannot be foretold,\\" says Ortega. Obviously, since this book is equally prescient about the Fascist rallies of the 1930s and the youth rebellion of the 1960s. Perhaps in light of the 20th Century, we should look back at this philosopher from its dawn and see that Gasset saw the fundamental problem of the next century (incorporating the majority into the political and cultural realms when they had been absent throughout history) and we failed to listen to his warning.	2004-03-10

Explaining the views of the various factions of literary theory well enough that their views are understandable, though not always worthy of esteem. Atlas seems nostalgic for a time when you were expected to read the great books which some have criticized for being written by dead European white men and at times lets his nostalga get in the way of presenting his argument. Overall, this is a good book worth reading, for its chronicle of the debate, if nothing else.	2004-03-10

Neither let him down. Ford tells a wonderfully human story, every character is understandable, respectable in their own way, yet all are detestable at times. There is no way he could have conveyed the chaos, tumults and complexities of the times without the self-interests, beliefs, customs, and morals of all parties accounted for without that reach or talent.<br /><br />Julian who will later become Emperor is virtually sentenced to death in Gaul only to emerge triumphant as his namesake did hundreds of years earlier. Emerging from his success in Gaul a respected commander, administrator and seen as a friend to all faiths (Christians are happy with him because he is a Christian, Pagans like him because he is willing to join in their rituals). Unfortunately, Julian has been a closet Pagan for some years, his hatred for the Church, his exposure to court life, and other factors cause this man who has always feared for his life to become the ultimate target. The story ends with Julian's invasion of Persia.<br /><br />Ford manages to take these groups that hate each other and in the process get you to understand their position, if he had not been able to do that this book for all his talent as a storyteller would not have been worth reading.	2004-03-07

The letters, all to a friend in London, are witty, insightful and at times wonderfully satyrical. For a time of student unrest, these letters provide a wonderful set of documents to read, the insight into the mentality of groups, the young, and men in general are filled with a biting wit which will allow you to breeze through this short work, enjoy it and learn from it. I will warn that Mercurius writes in a style of English resemblant to the English of the 17th and 18th centuries, with liberal use of Latin (usually 2-3 uses per piece) and 1 or 2 uses of Greek. Aside from the occasional problem with the language, you shall have no trouble understanding the events described as there are notes that have been added to the original text that explain much that non-contemporaries would have trouble understanding.	2003-09-07

Jack Beeching tells the story of the Battle of Lepanto through the life story of Don Juan as he is popularly known. Be it putting down a rebellion of Muslims, leading the Holy League at sea against the Ottoman fleet, or fighting for his half-brother the King of Spain, Don Juan's life becomes the focus point for life in the 16th century.<br />Beeching writes in a clear style that flows immaculately. His insight at various times is astounding. Unfortunately, I do have one complaint, while there is a good bibliography in the back, Beeching left out source attributions for all of his quotes. I know this is not an important point for most readers, but for those interested reading further on the topic it would be quite helpful.	2003-05-10

So the recruiment process of contemporary western intelligence agencies are not covered. Aside from that this is a great book by a man who has an incredible life experience.	2001-05-13
