Mix Cellini is a former abused child with the attendant potential for violence.  He is obsessed with mass murderer Reggie Christie (who really did live in Notting Hill) and with supermodel Nerissa Nash.  Nerissa has her own fantasies about the boy next door.  Gwendolyn Chawcer, an octogenarian who rents a flat to Mix Cellini, constantly remembers her own great love, a doctor who attended her dying mother fifty years earlier.  The plot interweaves between these characters and their obsessions, finally culminating in a tragic but satisfying ending for two characters and greater maturity and self-knowledge for the third.<br /><br />The settings add to the pleasure of the plot twists.  London's Notting Hill is a crowded, cosmopolitan area with many neighborhoods ranging from posh to slum, and Gwendolyn Chawcer's crumbling, dust-filled mansion is an appropriately creepy, even haunted, center for the mystery's unfolding. There are also many lesser characters whose personalities and observations add to the story and help illuminate the main plot.<br /><br />Thirteen Steps Down is Rendell at her finest.	2005-10-12

Mann has taken much of what we thought we knew about the Native Americans and their world and thrown it out the window. In a pleasantly informal yet highly professional style, Mann recounts tales of his own studies and travels, as well as those of many archaeologists, historians, and anthropologists past and present throughout the Americas.<br /><br />If your knowledge of the Native Americans begins and ends with what you learned in school years ago, or with the stereotypes perpetuated by Hollywood, you are in for quite a shock.  To begin with, the Native Americans have been \\"natives\\" here for far longer than any one suspected. Next, their cultures were heterogeneous and quite advanced, in many ways far outdoing their counterparts in Europe.  And in what may be the most controversial sections, Mann maintains that the Native Americans were neither primitive savages who left no mark on their world, nor dreamy proto-environmentalists who lived as one with nature, but rather people who throughly altered and shaped their landscapes.<br /><br />This is not a book which will please many with an agenda on either the pro-development or pro-environment side, but it will be found invaluable by those who seek a better understanding of the \\"New World\\" before the Europeans \\"discovered\\" it.	2005-09-13

But the real charm of these pictures and drawings illustrating The Hobbit is that they come from Tolkien's own pen and brush, and thus represent the author's true vision of Middle-earth.<br /><br />Tolkien was a skilled artist, and his talents are well displayed here in these drawings and paintings.  The best of these are Tolkien's own paintings.  I am particularly fond of April's The Hill and December's Conversation With Smaug.  Some of the illustrations were originally black and white drawings Tolkien produced for the book which have been colorized by H.E. Riddett.  These have been reproduced many times since they were created in the 1970s.  I have never been as fond of these colorized versions as I am of the black and white originals, since they seem to lack the true Tolkien spirit.  Possibly that is because I am extremely familiar with the originals, and thus anything different strikes a false note.  I do think the Riddett versions of the Misty Mountain landscape and the Elven-king's gate are quite nice.<br /><br />All of these illustrations have been reproduced before in various calendars and in Christina Scull and Wayne Hammond's authoritative J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator. The short biography and book covers on the back page are identical to the 2005 calendar.	2005-09-12

In this world, the South won the Civil War and then defeated the US again in the Second Mexican War in the early 1880s.  In World War I the CSA joined Britain, France, and Russia in a war against the USA, Germany, and Austria-Hungary.  After the CSA and its allies were defeated in 1917, they slid into fascist style dictatorships and began to prepare for a war of revenge.  World War II began in 1941 and now rages across the globe.<br /><br />Turtledove once again portrays a host of characters from both the US and the CS, jumping from one storyline to another several times in each chapter.  The CS has invaded the US and cut the North in two, but its charismatic President (dictator) Jake Featherston seems oblivious to warnings from his generals about overreaching.  Meanwhile, Featherston's Freedom Party is systematically carrying out a black Holocaust in a camp in Western Texas.  The US struggles to continue fighting, its leadership bolstered by the knowledge that a secret super weapon is under construction in the west.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of this Turtledove series is the way he interweaves imaginary and historic characters.  Thus Flora Hamburger Blackford, former US First Lady and now Socialist Congresswoman in Philadelphia (and my favorite character in the series), has many dealings with Robert Taft and Franklin Roosevelt.  Jimmy Carter also makes a brief appearance.<br /><br />Turtledove tries to carry on too many storylines and has too many characters who have little to no development.  Some segments, particularly battle scenes, seem to drag on too long (although Turtledove does us a service by emphasizing the blood and violence of war).<br /><br />I feel these weaknesses are outweighed by the imaginative sweep of the series and the insights we are given into our modern world with its suicide bombings and advocates of \\"preventive war\\".  Anyone with more than a cursory knowledge of World War II's actual history will be able to figure out what lies in wait for the US and the CS in the next volume, but the ultimate fate of Turtledove's many characters, both imaginary and historic, is still up in the air.with more than a cursory knowledge of World War II's actual history will be able to figure out what lies in wait for the US and the CS in the next volume, but the ultimate fate of Turtledove's many characters, both imaginary and historic, is still up in the air.	2005-08-23

I own two collections of her letters \\"Love From Nancy\\" and \\"The Letters of Nancy Mitford and Evelyn Waugh\\".  This volume, composed of letters between Mitford and the man with whom she shared ownership of a London bookstore, adds a different dimension to Mitford's communications in that they show her as a businesswoman and also as a researcher for her biographical works on Madame de Pompadour, Louis XIV, Voltaire, and Frederick the Great.<br /><br />Even though most of these letters had some sort of business or professional intent, all of them display Mitford's sparkling wit and sharp sense of humor.  The letters from Heywood Hill are also humorous and make it clear that this was not merely a professional relationship but a close and long lasting friendship. Together the two were friends with much of London's literary set and also had close ties of kinship and friendship with a large segment of the aristocracy.  It was probably a good thing that Nancy Mitford lived in Paris during most of the period covered by these letters.  Otherwise it is difficult to imagine any kind of work getting done at 10 Curzon Street for all the shrieks of laughter and impromptu parties, and the bookshop would have had to close years ago.<br /><br />Heywood Hill is still in business at 10 Curzon Street, and it is one of my favorite London bookshops. This collection is a perfect memoir, not just of two very bright and funny people, but of the business which brought them together and helps perpetuates their memory.	2005-07-25

This is what Mr. Goldberg claims his book was written to do.  It falls far short of what is required.<br /><br />In a breezy, often witty manner Mr. Goldberg writes short vignettes on individuals and groups whom he claims are vulgarizing our nation.  Few would disagree with him on some of his targets like Paris Hilton (it is actually her parents whom Mr. Goldberg attacks, not she herself).  But most of Mr. Goldberg's choices strike me as harmless (Sheila Jackson Lee is a tad eccentric, I agree, but as such she fits in well with many other Congressmen)or as chosen to appeal to the same audience which ate up Mr. Goldberg's last two books.<br /><br />Now Mr. Goldberg will claim that he is non-partisan, and indeed he has included a few right wingers like Roy Moore, Michael Savage, and Jimmy Swaggart on his roll, but by and large the list is Democratic/progressive.  And the charges Mr. Goldberg brings against them primarily all boil down to the same thing: they don't support, and don't like, George W. Bush.<br /><br />Again, Mr. Goldberg claims that he considers these people to be screwing up America not because of their beliefs, but because of the vulgarity with which they express themselves.  Undoubtedly it is true that many Hollywood stars are profane.  Undoubtedly it is also true that coarseness has contributed to the deep divisions and increasing partisanship amongst our citizens.  But this is not a Democratic malady alone.  Mr. Goldberg has limited his list primarily to those who intemperately attack George W. Bush.  If he was truly concerned about attacking the Presidency as an institution, as he maintains, he would have been better served to have looked back a few years and selected some individuals for inclusion on his list who made names for themselves attacking President Clinton and his family in some of the vilest and most disgusting terms possible.<br /><br />Of course, Mr. Goldberg did not do that because he has written this book to appeal to Bush supporters, many of whom have apparently come to believe that criticizing the present occupant of the Oval Office is a form of lese majeste which is deserving of the harshest of penalties.<br /><br />Mr. Goldberg has also taken the opportunity to even a few personal scores against Al Franken (who had the temerity to criticize him), and his old colleagues Dan Rather and Bill Moyers, among others.

Stephen Yafa has a personal interest in the subject in that he is a native of Lowell, Massachusetts, the first American cotton mill town.  I have a personal interest in cotton as well, being descended from generations of cotton planters and farmers in the southern US.  I was always grateful that my parents were able to make the jump away from cotton so that I didn't have to depend on the stuff for my livelihood, but the pervasiveness of the plant in human history and its impact on so many different regions came as a surprise to me as I read Big Cotton.<br /><br />Yafa begins Big Cotton with a discussion of the early origins and spread of the cotton plant in ancient human history.  The strongest sections of the book deal with the impact cotton had on the Industrial Revolution and the growth and development of the United States.  The later chapters deal with more social and cultural history and provide some intriguing speculations on the role genetically modified cotton will play in the future.  Yafa also gives some interesting information on the role of cotton in international affairs, as Chinese cotton production rises and as US cotton subsidies jeopardize the livelihoods of West African cotton farmers.<br /><br />Yafa writes in an informal, breezy style which is pleasant and often witty. (He apologizes in the introduction for the many unavoidable puns about the thread of the story and such, but these add to what is already a pleasureable reading experience.)	2005-06-07

However, many people today would be hardpressed to remember any earthshaking events that took place in 1759.  Frank McLynn has taken the annus mirabilis (as it was known in Britain at the time) and given it new life.<br /><br />1759 was the center point of the Seven Years War, a titanic struggle which has often been called the first true world war.  Many nations and areas were involved in the conflict, but the primary combatants were Britain and France.  The two European superpowers had been locked in battle for most of the last eighty years over who was going to be supreme in Europe and in the colonial areas.<br /><br />McLynn divides his book into chapters dealing with different areas which were at the center of the struggle in 1759: Europe, India, the Caribbean, and North America.  He describes such climatic battles as The Plains of Abraham and Quiberon Bay so clearly that even readers without military backgrounds can fully comprehend the strategies of the commanders.  He provides short but clear biographies of the leading actors in the drama of 1759 like George II, William Pitt, Louis Montcalm, Madame de Pompadour, and Louis XV.  Most impressively, he provides detailed but understandable analyses of the military and financial strengths and weaknesses of Britain and France.  I also appreciated the amount of material McLynn provides on the North American Indians and their societies, and how they played off the Europeans against each other in order to maintain their own existence.  McLynn is fair minded, giving horrific details of Indian atrocities against Europeans, but then describing similar atrocities performed by Europeans against the Indians and putting both in the context of what was a violent and bloodthirsty century (No \\"civilization against the savages\\" theme for McLynn, in other words).<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the short prologues at the beginning of most of the chapters giving some cultural perspectives on what was happening during 1759, so that the reader doesn't come away with the impression that it was all battle and no art or literature.  I tend to be a little doubtful that the Jacobites played quite as large a role in many of 1759's events as McLynn makes out, but that is understandable in that the declining fortunes of the Stuarts and their followers has been a central focus of his studies over many years.  All in all, 1759 is a masterful study of a year we ought to remember better.<br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the short prologues at the beginning of most of the chapters giving some cultural perspectives on what was happening during 1759, so that the reader doesn't come away with the impression that it was all battle and no art or literature.

David McCullough's already stellar reputation as an erudite but highly readable historian will be further burnished by his latest offering.  1776 is the story of the year every American knows, but doesn't really understand.  While we all know the significance of July 4, 1776, few recognize that the  act of declaring independence was only part of a larger story of struggle, defeat, and near catastrophe during that turning point year.  McCullough provides fascinating descriptions of battle after battle lost, of scruffy Americans withering under fire from the most efficient and best trained army in the world, and of despair turning to elation as the Americans turned on and crushed their foes at Trenton and Princeton.<br /><br />One of the many fine features of McCullough's work is his ability to draw portraits of men we revere as almost god-like (like Washington) that help us see them as actual humans, flawed but nevertheless exceptional.  Another fine trait is McCullough's even handedness.  One of the best sections of the book comes at the beginning with a description of King George III's declaring the colonists to be rebels.  McCullough shows us the King and his ministers not as the bumbling fools of legend but as the honorable, patriotic, leaders they were, blinded by their inability to understand the colonial point of view and certain that they were upholding the rights of free Britons by putting down the American rebels.<br /><br />1776 also pleases by liberally quoting from the letters and diaries of numerous American soldiers, so that the reader gets a sense of what life was like for the \\"grunts\\" as well as the leadership.  That aspect is what I will remember longest about 1776, the story of those grimy farmers and small businessmen who weren't really sure they wanted to be there, and who didn't really  trust or like their fellow soldiers from other colonies, but who put up with the dirt and the starvation and the danger because they trusted General Washington and were willing to fight for a vision they didn't fully understand but nevertheless valued.

The story is told through the eyes of Leonid Sednev, the fourteen year old kitchen boy who stayed with the Imperial Family up until the Bolshevik guards, in a rare show of pity, sent him away a few hours before their assassination.<br /><br />This is a work of fiction, but Robert Alexander did a marvelous job of research and produced a highly accurate portrait of the last Tsar,his family, their servants and guards.

Like her forebears, Fraser combines scholarship with an elegant and witty writing style to produce books which  illuminate and engage.<br /><br />King George III's six daughters tend to get short shrift from historians and biographers who focus on their father, their brothers, and their niece Queen Victoria. The prevailing picture of them is of six mousy women pushed into the background.  Fraser has pulled Charlotte, Augusta, Elizabeth, Mary, Sophia, and Amelia out of the shadows and let us see that they had strong personalities and lives of their own.<br /><br />The six princesses were victims of circumstance even more than most eighteenth century royal women.  Ordinarily they would have been married off to men they scarcely knew almost as soon as they reached puberty in order to strengthen Britain's alliances.  George III, however, had been horrified by the ill treatment two of his own sisters received at the hands of unloving husbands, and he was determined that his own daughters would not suffer such a fate.  Unfortunately his paternal affections did not extend to allowing his daughters to marry Englishmen they loved, and only meant that he turned down overtures from many foreign princes, usually without consulting his daughters at all. Furthermore, as the princesses reached marriageable age the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars  meant many possible suitors were now the enemies of Britain and thus out of bounds. Finally, George III's bouts of madness/porphyria attacks made him unable to entertain marriage offers, and his wife Queen Charlotte's deep depression over her husband's malady meant that she could not be a matchmaker either.<br /><br />Bereft of the chance to be proper wives and mothers (the only acceptable role for nearly all women of the period) the princesses lived under their parents' noses well into middle age.  They developed literary and artistic interests and were patrons of British charities, and managed little flirtations and dalliances here and there with gentlemen of the court.  One of Augusta's liaisons possibly ended in (an illegal) marriage, while Sophia actually produced an illegitimate child.  The princesses were dutiful and loving children to their increasingly difficult parents and were supportive siblings to their rackety brothers, who were also denied the chance to legally marry women they loved.<br /><br />It was only in middle age that some of the daughters married, Charlotte and Elizabeth to German princelings, Mary to an English cousin.  Charlotte probably had the most adventurous life, living in Wurttemburg right through several invasions by Napoleon and having to flee for her life at one point (Fraser's description of her life in temporary exile, accompanied by two kangaroos, is among the most amusing of the many anecdotes in the book.)<br /><br />The fine human qualities of the daughters are well portrayed here.  I felt sorriest for Amelia, whose unrequited love for an English officer lasted until her death in 1810.  I was impressed with the love  the daughters showed for their parents and their brothers, and by the love their brothers gave them in return. (Usually the later Hanoverians are depicted as  self-indulgent reprobates devoid of any finer qualities.) Finally, the love and regard the daughters had for each other, going to great trouble to visit when one was ill for example, is admirable.<br /><br />The final years of the daughters were quiet, marked by illness and decline, but I was glad to see that they were not lonely ones, but rather filled with visits from their surviving siblings and other relations and friends.  There is a charming photograph in the book of Queen Victoria with two of her children visiting Mary, the last survivor.  It is a fitting end to this story of six women who, though relatedto some of the wealthiest and most powerful people of their time, enjoyed unassuming and generally unremarked upon lives.hough related to some of the wealthiest and most powerful people of their time, enjoyed unassuming and generally unremarked upon lives.	2005-04-25

Stephen Poliakoff's dramatization of the life and times of young Prince John, the epileptic and possibly autistic youngest son of King George V and Queen Mary, is full of beautiful images. His screenplay helps viewers recognize the research and imagination that it took to bing such a creation to reality. Another interesting aspect of this screenplay is that it differs from the production as I saw it on \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" and then on DVD in some scenes, with extra dialogue in some scenes and with dialogue missing or shortened in others. Evidently this is an indication that a TV or movie production is an ongoing creation, with script changes being common right up to the final filming.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the notes Poliakoff provides explaining why he chose to portray certain scenes and characters as he did, giving historical background on some characters like Lord Stamfordham and insights into some segments, like George V's meeting on the Irish Question in 1914, which are otherwise somewhat obscure.<br /><br />There are a few errors of fact and interpretation which leap out at those who have already made a study of the people and events covered in this production.  Queen Mary's mother was Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, not Mary of Adelaide. (But Poliakoff does an excellent job of portraying Mary Adelaide and her effect on her daughter.) I also found the portrayal of the Russian Imperial Family's visit to England, while visually very beautiful, somewhat jarring, particularly in its depiction of Empress Alexandra as a tense, dictatorial neurotic.  Alexandra was a shy and reserved woman, but with family members, particularly those like George and Mary whom she had known for many years, she was relaxed and very down to earth. But these are mere quibbles only other royal aficionados will notice, and they do not detract from the overall quality of the production.	2005-04-21

Mary was a repressed and overworked daughter who suffered from some unidentified mental illness which, one day without warning, caused her to murder her mother. After spending several months in a madhouse, she was placed under the guardianship of her younger brother Charles, who looked after her the rest of his life through numerous committals to various institutions and several moves to different homes in London and its environs.  Together and separately the Lamb siblings were responsible for  many essays, stories, and other publications which established them as leading literary lights.<br /><br />Besides this tale of fraternal devotion, this book also provides a good depiction of life in London in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among the Lambs' literary milieu.	2005-04-13

First, as an historian, I was glad to see the rules true historians live by being used to unmask a man who distorted history.  Secondly, it was elevating to witness Lipstadt's courage and fidelity to her faith, her family, and to the truth through years of tension and weeks of witnessing painful testimony at her trial.  Third, I was impressed by the commitment so many people gave to helping Lipstadt prevail against Irving: the lawyers who agreed to work pro bono or at reduced rates, the publishers who stood by her when it would have been much easier to apologize to Irving and bail out of the trial, the countless people who opened their checkbooks to finance the enormously expensive undertaking, and the many others who encouraged her like taxi drivers, hotel owners, and Holocaust survivors who came to thank her for standing up for the truth.  Finally, this book is encouraging because it demonstrates that no matter how evil and well funded a lie can be, with diligence and determination the truth can be revealed.<br /><br />Most descriptions of trials, particularly one so detailed as this, become too dry for any but lawyers and other courtroom aficionados to appreciate.  History on Trial, despite the intricacies of the legal proceedings, is never dull and always fascinating.	2005-04-05

Although Maud of Norway (called Harry in the family), Sophie of Greece, Victoria Eugenie of Spain (Ena), Alexandra of Russia (Alix), and Marie of Rumania (Missy) were cousins who knew each other fairly well, their personalities and ultimate fates were very different.<br /><br />Most readers will be at least somewhat familiar with Alix's story, which has been told and retold many times on paper and on film, but Ena's struggles with the same hereditary disease of hemophilia, which she passed on to at least two of her sons, are less well known than those of her Russian cousin.  Similarly, while the story of Alix's overthrow in the 1917 Revolution and her subsequent death with her family has been described at length, few readers will be as familiar with Ena's long exile from Spain and Sophie's on again off again career as Queen of Greece. Harry's great success as the democratically chosen monarch of Norway and Missy's extensive struggles on behalf of Rumania deserve to be remembered as well.<br /><br />One of the most interesting achievements of this joint biography are the numerous parallels and comparisons that can be drawn between the five women.  We can see, for example, how Harry's natural modesty and informality made the Norwegians fall in love with her, and how Missy's beauty and elegance endeared her to the Rumanians.  On the other hand, Sophie, Alix, and Ena's shyness and natural reserve were not well received by their husband's subjects and helped lead to the downfalls of the monarchies in their countries. The cousins' origins outside of the countries they eventually ruled were also worthy of comparison.  Alix and Sophie's German blood were black marks against them (poor Sophie was on the outs with the Greeks for being German, and with her brother the Kaiser for not being German enough!), as was Ena's English reserve in Spain. As far as homelife goes, Alix seems to have had the only genuine love match among the five, since Sophie and Missy were married off for political considerations (to husbands they eventually came to love or at least respect), Ena for generally the same reasons (to a husband she eventually came to detest), and Harry married her cousin primarily to avoid being an old maid (but had a happy marriage regardless).<br /><br />Of all these women only Harry has been consistently remembered with love and respect by her adopted country.  Alix and Ena have been rehabilitated to a degree by the twists and turns of twentieth century history in their countries, and while Sophie and Missy are practically forgotten in Greece and Rumania today, it is to be hoped that their many contributions will eventually be recalled in Athens and Bucharest.<br /><br />None of these women were well educated or exceptionally intelligent, but the circumstances of their births and marriages gave them influence at a critical moment in world history.

I particularly enjoyed the segments where Gekoski describes his personal friendships and contacts with some of the authors.  I was amazed at some of the prices he has received for some books, and interested to see how authors go in and out of fashion, so that someone no one bothered to collect twenty years ago can suddenly become highly collectable and extremely expensive. (And enormously profitable to those far sighted enough to collect them ahead of time!)<br /><br />This book is about both the love of book collecting and the art of selling them.  While personally I doubt I could ever bear to sell some of the volumes Gekoski deals with if I were lucky enough to have them in my possession, I enjoyed this glimpse into what has obviously been a fascinating career.	2005-04-05

When complete, all of the Sherlock Holmes short stories and novels will be fully annotated, and the world of 221-B Baker Street and its denizens will be more intriguing than ever.<br /><br />As with most annotated books, it helps to be already familiar with the actual stories so that you can focus on the annotations.  Otherwise, you continually lose the thread of the story as you get sidetracked on one fascinating note after another.  And with Klinger's annotations, every note is captivating and lets the reader see new vistas of material.<br /><br />Conan Doyle, in common with J.R.R. Tolkien among other greats, was able to create characters and worlds who are so believable that many readers accept their reality.  This is part of the charm of Klinger's annotations, that he accepts the reality of Holmes and Watson and solemnly analyzes their movements and other activities as if they really occurred (which of course every Sherlockian knows they did!) Besides the notes themselves, Klinger also provides short essays analyzing enduring puzzles of the stories, like what sort of snake was \\"The Speckled Band\\" and how many times Watson was married.<br /><br />This, with the third volume which is promised for 2005, will be absolutely essential for every student/fan of Holmes and Watson. If you are an absolute novice, I'd suggest you first read the stories in an unannotated version, then after you get the plots down, you can absorb and enjoy the additional pleasures of Klinger's annotations.	2005-02-27

White writes clearly about what is often an extremely confusing subject, the years during which orthodoxies became heresies and then orthodoxies again with sometimes bewildering speed.<br /><br />I especially appreciated the tables which White provides summarizing the information available about the books of the New Testament and some of the early Christian leaders. These provide a handy reference point to which to turn when the intricacies of some doctrinal points become too complex to follow easily.<br /><br />From Jesus to Christianity will allow Christians and non-Christians alike to gain a better understanding of the early years of that faith, and a better appreciation of the lives of those early men and women who labored so mightily to help that faith survive.	2005-02-10

In Collapse, he examines the reasons why some societies have failed while others have succeeded, sometimes against all the odds.  Once again he uses environmental and geographical determinism to look at the histories of these societies, and comes up with fascinating new theories to explain their rise and demise.  I was particularly interested in the sections dealing with present day Montana and China, as they indicate so many potential and actual problems (as well as some good news) that face our world.<br /><br />I also found the segments on the Norse colonies in Greenland, Iceland, and elsewhere fascinating in the way Diamond analyzes the reasons for their successes and failures.  The segments on Easter Island and other Pacific islands also make intriguing reading as they demonstrate the connections between environmental and economic activity.  In fact, one of the chief pleasures of Collapse  is Diamond's ability to relate human events like the Rwanda-Burundi genocide to environmental factors.<br /><br />There will be many who will disagree with Diamond's thesis and with his list of suggested adjustments and improvements to the world ecological/environmental balance, but everyone will agree that Collapse is an important and stimulating achievement.	2005-02-03

Power's focus is on debunking the standard denials always made by US officials that \\"we didn't know until it was too late\\" by providing evidence of massive publicity of each genocide at the time it was taking place, and of the continuing determination of the US and other powers to do little or nothing about it.  Power also explains this lack of response as a necessary but cynical part of realpolitik in the twentieth century.  This is particularly effective in her chapters on Saddam Hussein's genocide of the Kurds in 1987-88 and of the Hutu massacres of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994.<br /><br />There are a number of heroes in Power's book, particularly Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term genocide and campaigned ceaselessly for an international treaty outlawing it.  Also worthy of praise are Henry Morgenthau, one of the few Americans who spoke up for the Armenians in 1915, William Proxmire, who was the only Senator to speak in favor of US ratification of the anti-genocide treaty for years, and Peter Galbraith,a State Department diplomat who risked his life and his career to report on what was happening to the Kurds.<br /><br />A Problem from Hell uplifts even as it depresses by illuminating the complicated dynamics behind the US and the West's lack of response to twentieth century genocide and the steadfastness with which the few who spoke up persevered.  Its a clear headed evaluation of a shameful subject which will help those who read it understand the reasoning behind official obfuscations, and in understanding, take the first step towards eliminating a crime against humanity.	2005-01-23

As in Floods, Famines and Emperors and The Little Ice Age, Fagan here digs into the minutiae of years of research into tree rings and glacial ice cores to illuminate just how much human history has been influenced by our planet's weather.  Fagan also demonstrates that long term weather conditions and changes can be predicted with a fair amount of accuracy based on that research.<br /><br />It would be easy for Fagan to capitalize on the sensationalist aspects of other \\"studies\\" of global weather and climate trends which predict imminent disaster from global warming and/or cooling.  Rather than stoop to such a level, Fagan instead calmly lays out the facts about ENSO, the Gulf Stream, and other global weather patterns and demonstrates that they have been factors in the rise and fall of many civilizations, from Mesopotamia to the Mayas.  Just as dispassionately, he details why climatological shifts, some of which could be dramatically quick, in all probability are due to influence some or all of our planet at some time in the future.	2005-01-18

Rumpole refers to the Penge Bungalow Affair throughout his reminiscences of other trials, but up until now we have not known exactly what happened and why it made Rumpole so famous.<br /><br />Now we have the full story at last.  Not only did the Penge Bungalow Murders lead to Rumpole's illustrious career, it also led to his introduction to She Who Must Be Obeyed: his future wife Hilda, daughter of Rumpole's Head of Chambers C.H. Wystan. Furthermore, the case itself is a most satisfying little mystery that will leave you guessing up to the very end.  I hope that other early Rumpole triumphs will soon follow.	2005-01-03

For the first time, J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece has received the treatment due to its classic status: leather binding, gilded edges, fine paper, everything the finest literary works should be accorded but are rarely given.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien was never very happy with the publishing treatment given to The Lord of the Rings.  He was obliged to leave out the pages of the dwarf history found in the Chamber of Mazarbul in Moria when the publishing technology of the mid 1950s wasn't able to accomodate his painstaking production.  He was never pleased with the arbitrary division of the book into three volumes, and much of the artwork, particularly that of the first American paperback editions, pained him deeply.  Now at last we can feel that he would pick up this edition and smile.<br /><br />For this edition Tolkien's son Christopher has carefully prepared the text so as to eliminate many typographical and other errors which had crept in over the years.  Noted Tolkien scholars Wayne Hammond, Christina Scull, and Douglas Anderson have contributed forewards to explain some of the history of these revisions. This edition will truly become the Standard Edition of The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />This edition of The Lord of the Rings is worthy to be read in Middle earth itself. As I hold it in my hands, I can imagine reading it sitting by an open round window in Bag End, or in the Hall of Fire in Rivendell, or on a flet in Lothlorien or  a tower in Minas Tirith. Any edition of The Lord of the Rings will introduce you to Tolkien's world.  Only this one will do so in a manner worthy of the genius of its creator.	2005-01-02

The Rottweiler's main setting is a London building with a shop on the ground floor and flats on the three floors above.  Inez owns the building and runs an antique shop there.  She lives on the first floor, and three other tenants, with sundry hangers on and secrets on the next two.  All of these people, plus customers, relatives, fiancees, et. al, wind in and out of the pages with their own little secrets, problems, and mysteries.<br /><br />Although the book is primarily about a murderer and how he is eventually caught, there are  many little subplots that are just as intriguing.  Most of the characters, even the murderer, are likeable and amusing sorts.  Rendell's policemen have a Keystone Kops quality about them in this book, which makes an interesting contrast to her superb Inspector Wexford series.  Obviously not all of London's finest are all that fine!	2004-12-29

Not only do you get hundreds of cartoons printed within the book, along with essays on the many artists and on certain subjects that seem to endlessly recur, but you also get two CDs with every single cartoon ever printed in The New Yorker, from the beginning up until about February of 2004.  These CDs are so intoxicating that you can easily spend hours just flipping from one cartoon to the other, or exploring the works of different cartoonists, or examining themes and subjects as their treatments have changed over the years, or anything.  The CD indices can be a little difficult to navigate and can be frustrating if you are looking for a certain cartoon you remember from years earlier, but don't quite remember the exact wording of the tag line or the exact makeup of the drawing, but that just leads you to find even more cartoons you like so well, you eventually forget what you were looking for in the first place!<br /><br />Buy this book and keep it in a place of honor on a (strong) table or shelf to which you have easy access (and is near your computer), because you'll be constantly wanting to go back and page through it!	2004-12-29

It begins with the first English efforts to sail beyond their small island's home waters and traces the story through the Navy's most glorious years in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries into its decline in the twentieth, finishing up with a brief survey of the Navy's activities during the 1982 Falklands War.<br /><br />This is not your average military history or a patriotic review of a nation's pride.  There is plenty of detail about events and details which ordinarily wouldn't be considered germane to the subject, but Herman deftly ties things together and shows how the Navy played a role.  Herman also doesn't hesitate to burst a few balloons, like denying that the Armada was a splendid victory (the English were lucky that the Spanish really weren't all that eager to conquer them) or that Trafalgar was a turning point (Napoleon had already abandoned his plan to conquer England).<br /><br />To me the most interesting parts of this book were the little biographies of famous English/British seamen like Francis Drake, John Hawkins, and Horatio Nelson.  I also enjoyed reading about the technological advances and developments that enabled the Royal Navy to dominate the world for decades.  I would have enjoyed having some pictures/drawings of the various ships and captains, and there really weren't enough maps to do the story justice, but these are mere technicalities in what was a very satisfying read.	2004-12-21

Charlie Brown is still a smart aleck, but gradually his professional victimhood is taking form.  Lucy is still sweet and babyish at the beginning of this volume, but by the end she is definitely moving towards her loud mouth, abrasive, loveable self.  Snoopy is becoming less doggy and more human (we get to imagine the inside of his doghouse for the first time), and Linus is showing signs of genius even though he can't speak yet.  We also see some favorite characters for the first time, noteably Pig Pen, and get to see some failed experiments, such as Charlotte Braun, a loud mouth who moved into the neighborhood for awhile but obviously didn't work out.<br /><br />I was also interested to see some indirect allusions to the real world of the mid 1950s in these early strips, such as one character's refusing to incriminate himself (he must have been watching the McCarthy hearings on those old TV sets!).<br /><br />This is a fun volume which presages some of the finest Peanut moments, which we'll be able to see again in coming years, thanks to this series' creators.	2004-11-29

Later Violet joins the gang, and along about the middle we meet a sweet little baby girl named Lucy.  Those of us who remember Peanuts in its glory years (late 1950s to late 1960s) will be taken somewhat aback by some of the personalities of these early characters, particularly by how smart alecky and unvictimlike Charlie Brown was in the beginning, but that is part of the charm of watching a classic as it develops.

Beam Piper (from whom the concept is borrowed) and Robert Heinlein in producing an enjoyable story, aimed primarily at young adults, which will entertain almost anyone interested in science fiction and/or history.<br /><br />Curious Notions is a shop set up by Crosstime Traffic in a San Francisco where Germany won World War I and has dominated the planet for nearly two hundred years.  Paul Gomes and his father sell high tech devices from the Home Timeline in order to obtain money to buy produce for their own overcrowded and inflation-plagued version of Earth.  Inevitably, the German overlords and the local Chinese-American underworld become curious as to the provenance of the goods on sale at Curious Notions, and the Gomes family is imperiled by not one but two competing sets of bad guys.<br /><br />The story is clearly written without the excessive number of characters and side plots which often weakens a Turtledove book.  I found the glimpses of differences between the Home Timeline and the German ruled World fascinating.  There are also some interesting moral dilemmas which are satisfactorially worked out.<br /><br />Like Gunpowder Empire (the first Crosstime Traffic Book), Curious Notions is diverting and highly entertaining.  I look forward to other installments with bated breath.	2004-10-31

Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval have produced a number of books, separately and together, on various subjects of esoteric interest, primarily dealing with the possibility of a hitherto unknown civilization having existed before the last Ice Age.  These books are usually diverting and often thought provoking, as is Talisman, even when the reader fails to be convinced of the overall thesis of the authors.<br /><br />Talisman supposedly describes the centuries old history of a secret faith which has surfaced time and again in human history.  The sections which deal with the early Christian gnostics and the Cathars are very well done and provide some intriguing information about the parallels between those groups of which I had not previously known.  I also found the segments dealing with the Templars and their links to the Freemasons intriguing, as will other readers who have enjoyed such books as Holy Blood, Holy Grail, The Messianic Legacy, and others of that ilk.<br /><br />Where I found my interest and credulity flagging were the sections dealing with the numerous references to Ancient Egyptian religion to be found among the French Revolutionaries and in the supposed Masonic symbolism to be found in cities like Washington and Paris. Egyptian references during the French Revolution make sense when you remember that the Catholic Church was considered an arm of the French monarchy, and that therefore anti-monarchists would also be anti-Church and seek to replace it with symbols of other faiths.  Also it is well known that Freemasons were actively involved in the Enlightenment Period and that many early US leaders were (and continue to be in the present era) Masons.  However, I tend to be skeptical of maps detailing straight lines linking different sites.  (It has always been my observation that if you draw lines long enough and in enough directions you can link up just about anything you want to.)<br /><br />I was also somewhat puzzled by the references to 9/11 that are tagged on at the end of the book.  While Al Qaeda members certainly appear to be gullible enough to swallow the idea of a huge Jewish/Masonic conspiracy against them, I don't believe that Osama bin Laden chose to destroy the World Trade Center because the towers had Masonic significance!<br /><br />All in all I can say that this is an entertaining book which will provide a lot of interesting information about Gnosticism, Catharism, and other assorted heresies and the Catholic Church's responses to them, but unfortunately mixed in with this material is a lot of poorly sorted out and ultimately irrelevant data./11 that are tagged on at the end of the book.

In the 1950s and 1960s she also produced a number of historical works, of which The Sun King is one of the best.<br /><br />The Sun King is a personal biography of Louis XIV.  It does not deal in great detail with the political, military, or economic issues of Louis XIV's reign but primarily focuses on his personal life and that of his family.  Louis married his double first cousin Marie Therese of Spain (she being his genetic sister for all intents and purposes, the reader is amazed that his family turned out as strong and healthy as they did).  He also had three major mistresses and a string of casual acquaintanceships which produced a number of illegitimate children.  His numerous relations also produced a quantity of children and had many extramarital relationships.<br /><br />A major part of the book deals with the construction of Versailles.  Indeed the book seems almost to be a biography of the chateau.  The profuse illustrations, including many photographs of the chateau and its grounds, add immeasurably to the pleasure of reading this work.<br /><br />But the most compelling reason for reading The Sun King is to enjoy Mitford's elegant, witty, prose style, which is as much in evidence here as in her novels.	2004-10-24

Imagined London is a wonderful love story.  Anna Quindlen, who had visited London in her dreams for many years, made her first physical visit in 1995.  She tells the story of that visit, and many subsequent ones, in this all too slim volume about the great city's many literary connections.<br /><br />This book reminds me of Helene Hanff's The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street in that it focuses on literary London, but like that book, Imagined London appeals on many levels. A visitor to London can use it as a walking tour guide, for example.  Even those who will rarely or never visit the city will find the elegant writing and deft descriptions are to be treasured.<br /><br />My only complaint about Imagined London is that it is far too short!  Had it been two or even three times as long, I would still savor every word!	2004-10-17

The celebrated Mitford wit,most clearly displayed by Debo's sisters Nancy and Jessica, is in evidence, particularly in the sections that deal with Debo's childhood and early adult years (she once traveled by train from Scotland with a goat, milking it in first class waiting rooms on the way.)<br /><br />Also in evidence is the extraordinariness of Debo's life as wife of a Duke and as chatelaine of one of England's great mansions, Chatsworth House.  She casually drops names like Harold Macmillan and John Kennedy (both of whom were indirectly related to her husband) and at the same time records some of the merriments and aggravations that come with having your home on display to tourists several months each year.  Occasionally Debo will drop a barbed comment or two on the silliness of some politicians and visitors, but for the most part she is soft spoken and accomodating.<br /><br />Few Duchesses have written or revealed much about their lives, so its nice that one has done so now, at a time when the House of Lords is being democratized and the aristocracy must seem more anachronistic than ever.	2004-10-17

Christians had been a persecuted minority for nearly 300 years.  Now they found themselves protected and patronized by the Roman government, and this allowed tensions over differing interpretations of Scripture and over the nature of Jesus and his relationship to God to bubble to the surface.<br /><br />This is primarily the story of two bishops, Arius and Athanasius.  Arius believed that Jesus, while similar to God, was not of the same substance.  Athanasius regarded Jesus and God as indivisible and identical.  The controversies engendered by this difference of belief caused so much turmoil that the Emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea to settle the issue.  At Nicaea the issue was settled in favor of Athanasius, whose idea became part of official Christian dogma (the Trinity.)<br /><br />Controversy continued.  A succession of emperors saw first Athanasius, then Arius, in official favor.  The succession of Emperor Julian then threatened Christianity's official position and a revival of paganism.  Eventually, Athanasius' side won out, and Arianism was consigned to heresy.<br /><br />Rubenstein describes these complicated events in a clear, interesting manner  that even those who are neither theologians nor historians can follow.  He brings a unique perspective to the subject in that he himself is Jewish.  He points out that the triumph of Athanasius forever limited the appeal of Christianity to the monotheistic Jews, and eventually made the success of strongly monotheistic Islam possible.<br /><br />This is a well written, well researched book which sheds a lot of light on a particularly shadowy corner of religious history.	2004-10-07

I have not seen the original so I can't tell how much of this book is new material (beyond a chapter dealing with Peter Jackson's films).  Lobdell has examined Tolkien's writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives.  One of the most interesting deals with the influence of Edwardian adventure fiction (Haggard, etc.) on Tolkien.  Another fascinating chapter deals with Middle Earth as a Christian world in a pre-Christian age.  There is also a short fiction story in an Appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to Tolkien's own abandoned sequel to The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the Shadow.  I enjoyed this story, though of course Lobdell as a fiction writer cannot measure up to Tolkien. (But then, no one can!)<br /><br />I am a long time Tolkien reader and addict (since the age of 12 in 1969.)  Most of the time I do not care for Tolkien \\"criticism\\" and \\"literary analysis\\", which to me seems to suck out the magic, but Lobdell's work is different.  The World of the Rings enhances Middle Earth and intensifies the love I feel for it.	2004-09-27

All of the illustrations are by J.R.R. Tolkien himself, created while he was working on the book in the 1930s and 1940s.  The illustrations have been published before, some in the first few Tolkien calendars in 1972 and 1973, others in Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien in the late 1970s, and all of them in Christina Scull and Wayne Hammond's classic  J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator.<br /><br />Tolkien was a gifted artist and draftsman.  Even his doodles, like Shelob's Lair (drawn on a page of manuscript) in October, display a high degree of talent and precision.  He was famously finicky about his drawings, insisting that each one should precisely mirror the story.  (This led to his cropping some elements of some drawings, like March's Moria Gate, which displays both the full picture and the part that was trimmed off; and totally discarding others, like the abortive cityscape of Steinborg shown for September.)  This perfectionism led to some absolutely beautiful productions.  I am particularly fond of April's Lothlorien, showing the mallorns in full flower, and of February's view of Rivendell looking east: a tumbled landscape of stone, water, and trees.<br /><br />Those who have become used to the artwork of others in previous Tolkien calendars, and those whose primary view of Middle earth was shaped by the Peter Jackson films, may be a bit put off by these drawings by Tolkien himself.  July's Orthanc, for example, provides a rather modest view of Saruman's tower compared to that seen in the movie.  Those of us who are true lovers of Middle earth, however, will find that these drawings are especially beautiful, regardless of any intrinsic aesthetic value, because they allow us to see Tolkien's own vision as it unfolded in his mind and flowed from his pen and brush.	2004-09-12

In 1912 the US had been through approximately a dozen years of reform and regulation known by historians as the Progressive Era.  The Republican Party, led by Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, had been the chief agent of Progressive legislation during two Administrations.  Now in 1912 the GOP turned on itself, with the widely perceived as more conservative Taft, the incumbent President, in battle with his former friend Theodore Roosevelt, who had become steadily more radical in his thinking.  The result was a revolt at the Republican Convention and the splintering off of the Progressive or Bull Moose Party.<br /><br />The Democrats had been traditionally slower to embrace Progressive reforms, but in 1912 their standardbearer Woodrow Wilson, originally nominated as a conservative, led them to acceptance of a reforming agenda.  Finally, Eugene Debs and his Socialist Party had been calling for even more far reaching reforms.<br /><br />The election ended with an Electoral College landslide for Wilson and the Democrats.  The Socialists and the Progressives did quite well in the popular vote, and the more conservative Republicans were all but annihilated.  The realignment which began in 1912 led to the Democrats becoming the chief party of reform in the twentieth century, with the Republicans locked in battle between their conservative and moderate wings.  Much of the next century's political history was set on course in 1912.<br /><br />This is a well written account of the election which does not go deeply into theory or ideology.  It is a personal account, with many entertaining anecdotes and biographies of the candidates and their families and supporters. I recommend it for arm chair politicians and historians.	2004-09-07

However, the famous first line \\"Take my camel, dear . . .\\" will soon warn that there is much much more to this hilarious, odd little novel.<br /><br />Rose Macaulay uses as narrator the ambiguously named Laurie.  Most people assume Laurie is a woman, and there is some internal evidence to substantiate this, but as other reviewers have pointed out, Laurie could just as well be a man, and in some ways, the story makes more sense if he is.<br /><br />Regardless of Laurie's gender, the story revolves principally around her/his Aunt Dot, one of the great British eccentrics, and her escapades on a journey through Turkey and into the Soviet Union.  Her adventures, and those of Laurie, the camel, a monkey, and various other assorted characters, are hilarious.  At the same time, there is a sad note of wistfulness tand a sense of loss and deprivation that are not quite so easy to sort out.<br /><br />Read The Towers of Trebizond and laugh, but you'll be pondering it in more solemn moments for a long time to come.	2004-09-07

It is the fictional chronicle of the life of Old Herbaceous, the head gardener at an English manor house.  He begins life as a foundling child, early develops a love for flowers which grow along an abandoned canal, and then becomes a gardener at the manor house after impressing the Lady of the Manor at a garden show.  Gradually he rises through the ranks of gardeners to eventually become head gardener.<br /><br />This book is pleasing for several reasons.  First, it helps us understand what a complex thing an English manor house must have been, with its ranks of servants and underlings.  Secondly, it has beautiful descriptions of flowers, shrubs, trees, and other elements of the English countryside.  Finally, its a great social history in microcosm of the changes England underwent from the 1870s through the World War II era.<br /><br />In many ways Old Herbaceous is another Goodbye Mr. Chips: a short quiet book about a seemingly unimportant individual who turns out to be much more than he appears.	2004-08-31

David Bossie, in his spare time from pursuing the Republican agenda at taxpayer's expense in the House of Representatives, has produced what he undoubtedly believes to be a stunning indictment of the Democratic Presidential nominee.<br /><br />In a word:  trite.  In another word:  pathetic.  Mr. Bossie has been a very busy boy tracking down every statement, every speech, and every interview Senator Kerry has given over the past twenty years and analyzing them for apparent contradictions and misstatements.  The only people who are convinced by this effort are people who share Mr. Bossie's own political views.  Of course Mr. Bossie is shocked by some of Senator Kerry's stands and positions.  Mr. Bossie is a Republican, and Senator Kerry is not.  But it is hubristic in the extreme to claim that just because Senator Kerry's views differ from one's own that they are therefore injurious to the Republic or just plain evil.  Furthermore, Mr. Bossie, apparently used to people like George W. Bush who rarely if ever ponder anything, gets upset when Senator Kerry thinks things through and sometimes actually changes his mind.  Mr. Bossie may not think that intellectual musings are an essential component of a Presidential mentality, but most of us will beg to differ.<br /><br />The air of righteous indignation suffusing this slim volume does not obscure some interesting observations which can be made about Mr. Bossie himself.  He apparently lacks any sense of irony, which becomes clear when he slams Senator Kerry's supposedly privileged background.  Apparently he has never stopped to consider that any patrician advantages enjoyed by Senator Kerry in his formative years were more than matched by those enjoyed (and heavily utilized)by Mr. Bossie's hero, George W. Bush himself.  Slamming the Eastern Establishment and fine old New England family backgrounds would therefore seem to be somewhat pointless and indeed counter productive this year at least.  (Perhaps Mr. Bossie would prefer a candidate who was born unprivileged in a very backwards environment and made his way to the top without family influence to help him?  If so, he should  take another look at Bill Clinton.)<br /><br />Mr. Bossie also waxes indignant over Senator Kerry's Vietnam exploits.  I suppose having a genuine military hero for an opponent must really gall Republicans whose own leaders displayed a conspicuous reluctance to go help the South Vietnamese fight off the Commies, even though the said leaders were otherwise gung ho supporters of that conflict.  However, to sneer at Senator Kerry's medals and to poke fun at those veterans who stand at his side (or who can no longer stand but must sit like Max Cleland) cheapens and denigrates all medals and all veterans, even those currently in the pay of the Republican campaign.  And to attack Senator Kerry for his former membership in an organization which had some members who advocated violence is to play the old McCarthyite gambit in a manner worthy of old Tailgunner Joe himself.  Therefore it is fitting to end my review with a paraphrase of the famous rebuke to Senator McCarthy in 1954:  \\"You have done enough.  Have you no decency, sir, at long last.  Have you left no sense of decency?\\"e seem to be somewhat pointless and indeed counter productive this year at least.

Now, in 1941, the stage is set for World War II.  Jake Featherston, the Fascist-style President of the CSA, is determined both to defeat the United States, thus avenging the South's loss in World War I, and to find a \\"final solution\\" to the black population in the South, which in Featherston's eyes treacherously stabbed the CSA in the back.  War begins on June 22, 1941, with a sneak attack by the CSA on the USA which splits the North through Ohio in a matter of a few weeks.<br /><br />Many characters from previous books in the series have returned.  I am particularly fond of Flora Hamburger Blackford,  Congresswoman from New York and former US First Lady, who I hope will eventually become President herself. The many characters tend to be confusing, as some of them are hardly memorable, but I suppose they are necessary in order to provide a full picture of the conflict.  Another Turtledove trick I enjoy is his habit of working real historical figures into the action, like Patton, FDR, and Churchill.<br /><br />I wish Turtledove would focus on fewer characters and round them out a bit more, and that he would give us more news of what's going on in the rest of the world while the war rages in North America.  (There are some hints of a British-French invasion of Western Europe and Germany, and of a Tsarist Russian invasion of Ukraine, but these are few and far between.) But even so, I'm enjoying this alternate history and hope Turtledove will carry it right through the twentieth century.	2004-08-24

This book, and the television commercials which accompany it, are further proof that the Republican Party will not hesitate to slime even the most heroic individuals.  As a Georgian, I had the misfortune to witness an earlier version of this underhanded and vicious assault on the best of us in the 2002 Senate campaign, when a triple-amputee Vietnam veteran was accused of making common cause with Osama bin Laden.  But the scale of this monstrous assault on Senator John Kerry beggars even that infamous episode.  Perhaps the Republicans might not feel so outraged by men who served honorably in Vietnam if any of their own \\"leaders\\" had actually served there themselves.<br /><br />The men whose names are attached to this book and to the commercials all claim that Senator Kerry has misrepresented his war service.  Only a few years ago, however, these same men were loud in their praise of the Senator.  Some of them are proud to claim medals which they were awarded as a result of the same actions in which Senator Kerry took part.  In their eagerness to belittle Senator Kerry's heroism they downgrade their own, and more importantly, that of countless other men and women who served with distinction. That is the saddest part of this current Republican campaign of destruction in that so many of its victims will never have the chance to fight back and defend themselves.<br /><br />With the support of the men who were actually on his swift boat and who stand firmly behind him, Senator Kerry will weather this sneak attack as he has so many others.  Truly patriotic Americans will look to Senator Kerry and  those men who were actually there with him like William B. Rood of the Chicago Tribune, as well as to such brave and honorable men as Senator John McCain who denounce these Republican tactics, for examples of honor and decency in our public life.	2004-08-23

As editor and writer at The New Republic and The New Yorker, he has set a standard for spare, simple prose that is both elegant and profound.<br /><br />The articles in Politics range far and wide, from commentary on presidential elections to reviews of concerts.  I particularly enjoyed Hertzberg's evaluation of Jimmy Carter and his Presidency (he was a speechwriter in that Administration) and his rueful analysis of how differently (and more wisely) an Al Gore Administration might have handled September 11 and its aftermath than did Bush.  It was also interesting to see how prescient Hertzberg was at times in predicting election outcomes and cultural trends, and how at other times he was completely off the mark.<br /><br />This is a book to be read carefully over a long period of time.  Keep it handy, especially during the next few months before November 2004, and dip into it when a dose of clearheadedness is required.	2004-08-16

There have been innumerable biographies of Queen Victoria and her children, but none that have focussed only on their childhoods.  This book therefore fills a gap, and does so with an interesting, fresh style which makes use of plenty of anecdotes, some well known, others more obscure.  I was interested to come across some of these stories, because I have read many histories and biographies of the period, and many of Van der Kiste's anecdotes were brand new.  Both Queen Victoria and her son Edward VII had childhoods best described as dysfunctional, but its interesting to see how the future king seems to have learned from his parents' mistakes and given his own children a happier upbringing.  Queen Victoria also seems to have mellowed as she grew older, and its nice to read about the antics her younger grandchildren and great-grandchildren were allowed to get away with, like slapping the Queen's hand and saying &quot;Naughty Grandmamma!!&quot;<br />This is a nice addition to anyone's library of books about royals or books about children.	2004-07-13

Born Temujin in an obscure branch of an obscure group of nomads in Central Asia, Genghis Khan first gained supreme power over the Mongols, whom he unified and turned into a superb fighting machine, then proceeded to conquer much of Eurasia.  Weatherford occasionally has to refute some romantic legends that have grown up around Genghis Khan and his family, but the truth is dynamic enough.<br />Of especial interest is Weatherford's coverage of the after effects of Genghis Khan's empire.  The Mongol Empire lasted for only about a century, but its influence lingers on.  Cross regional trade tied Europe, Asia, and the Middle East motightly together than ever before.  An efficient communications system enabled information to spread at an unprecedented pace.  So much of what we regard as essential accoutrements of our modern world can be traced back to the Mongols.<br />Yes, the stories of Mongol cruelty and ruthlessness are accurate and Weatherford fully covers them, but this book makes clear that without the Mongol influence, our world today might be much poorer.	2004-07-07

Over the next four years Louis-Charles lost his possessions and his family.  He was kept in prison, brutalized by the guards and deprived of the companionship of his older sister.  He remembered his mother and brought flowers to her cell door months after her execution.  His death at the age of about ten must have been a merciful release.<br />The next part of the book deals with the odyssey of the Dauphin's heart, which was spirited out of the prison by one of the doctors who examined the boy's body.  We also learn of the many pretenders who claimed to be the Dauphin and of the pain they caused Marie-Therese, the only surviving child of Louis XVI.<br />Finally, we learn how the process of determining the real identity of the heart through DNA analysis developed in the 1990s.  After reading of the travails little Louis-Charles endured in prison, it is comforting to know that at long last we know his ultimate fate, thanks to learning and technology undreamed of in his own time.	2004-07-05

Mr. Gibson begins his diatribe with a description of the experiences of a friend of his in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.  After such a beginning, one would expect the next chapters to deal with Al Qaeda, or Sadaam Hussein, or the Taliban.  Actually the next chapter deals with . . . France!  Mr. Gibson then goes on to blast Germany, Britain, Arabs and Muslims in general without discrimination, the cunningly nicknamed Axis of Envy (Canada, South Korea, and Belgium, well known rogue terrorist states), before finally moving on to his real target, the Democratic Party.<br />Make no mistake, this is not a study of anti-American feelings in the world, but a political work designed to rally the troops around an increasingly beleaguered Administration by using that well known McCarthyite tactic of demonizing its enemies.<br />Mr. Gibson ignores or mitigates the Bush Administration's missteps, blunders, and lies. He sneers at those who have honest differences of opinion with the Administration's policies, here and abroad, and characterizes debate as treason. These are sentiments one would expect to be aired by  propagandists for dictatorships, not by journalists in a democracy.<br />Here in the US we have unfortunately come to recognize this sort of name calling and distortion as the norm in our politics. It is to be hoped that European and Asian readers of Mr. Gibson's diatribe will realize that not all Americans have forgotten the blanket of flowers in front of the US Embassy in Paris on September 12, 2001, or the throngs of weeping people waving US flags in Asian and European cities, or the sound of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; being played in front of Buckingham Palace, or the activation of NATO's mutual defense agreements for the first time that dark September.<br />Mr. Gibson wants the US to forget that outpouring of good will and love, and also the widespread international support we had in the invasion of Afghanistan that fall.  He wants us to forget all that, because if we remember it, the obvious question to ask is &quot;Why does the Administration of the most powerful nation on earth have so little international credibility?&quot;  The answer to that question cannot be found by making snide attacks on other nations or by smearing the political opposition at home, but through the recognition that the Administration in question is badly flawed and deserves to be replaced.s the US to forget that outpouring of good will and love, and also the widespread international support we had in the invasion of Afghanistan that fall.

In this case that component is, of course, gunpowder.  Jack Kelly traces the history of this material from China through the Middle East into Europe and the rest of the world.  Kelly explains the different ways in which gunpowder changed the course of events.  He gives vignettes of battles like Crecy and the Siege of Petersburg to illustrate the important role gunpowder weapons played.  Along the way he drops fascinating little nuggets of material, like the real reason Joan of Arc was a success, that are intriguing enough to encourage further study.<br />Kelly is not a professional historian but a novelist, and his writing flows smoothly.  He does not bother with footnotes, but he does provide a good summary of his sources (which are excellent) at the end. This is a book which will be well worth the reading and many subsequent rereadings.	2004-06-13

In Colossus he maintains that the US is imperialistic, should not be ashamed of being imperialistic, and in fact should be encouraged to be even more imperialistic, both now in Iraq and in the future as well.<br />As in Empire, his history of the British Empire, Ferguson believes that imperialism, particularly what he calls liberal imperialism, is highly desirable in that it provides stable governments and institutions.  There seem to be some blind spots n his view, however.  Ferguson claims that imperialism is needed to overcome the multitudinous problems of the Third World.  But weren't many of those problems caused by imperialism in the first place?  Ferguson also claims that earlier imperialists went out and imperialized in order to do good, citing a quote from Toynbee as evidence. Of course its always nice to claim that you are doing something for someone else's own good, but most of the time people see through it pretty quickly. Ferguson also dismisses the original governments and societies of areas that were imperialized as being ineffective and impractical, but surely the people living under them would not necessarily agree.<br />There are many other holes that can be poked in Ferguson's arguments, but even so the book is well written and highly thought provoking. It ought to be read at this moment, when the question of American involvement in Iraq and elsewhere is in many people's minds.	2004-06-10

In Sleeping With the Devil he forcefully describes  the United States' long tangled relationship with what must be one of the most dysfunctional states in the world:  Saudi Arabia.  A former CIA agent, Baer served for many years and was well positioned to observe the nation long touted as our best friend in the Middle East.  He describes in chilling detail the corruption surrounding the House of Saud and the growing unrest and poverty that afflicts a kingdom whose citizens would be among the best off in the world if they had a decent government.<br />There's plenty of blame to go around, and Baer shovels it out left and right, starting with Franklin Roosevelt and the Americans who made the original oil deals with the Saudis in the 1930s and 1940s, through Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II.<br />When you finish reading this book, you are left with the uncomfortable realization that the Western economy rests in large part in the hands of a group of playboys who govern a country which is growing increasingly restless.  This book will help you understand why so many of the 9-11 hijackers were Saudis, and why Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda have such wide appeal.  You will also realize that even if we do manage to pull out of Iraq without much more bloodloss, we are most likely only at the beginning of what promises to be an extraordinarily violent period of heavy involvement in the Middle East. Thanks to Baer, those who read his book will at least have the comfort of being able to say &quot;I saw it coming!&quot;	2004-06-06

Fortunately for the country, he has changed his ways and is now seeking to make amends for the damage he and his former cohorts have done.  The Republican Noise Machine, like its predecessor Blinded By The Right, gives names, dates, and places in stunning detail of the ways in which the Right Wing has seized control of a significant portion of the media resources of our nation.  Using their access to the airwaves to spew propaganda, the Right Wing has sought to set the political agenda of this country as effectively as Goebbels managed the Third Reich's news organs.  To a frightening extent, they have succeeded so well that truly &quot;fair and balanced&quot; reporting is threatened. Brock gives example after example of how dissenting points of view are drowned out or squeezed to the sidelines, how the party line is set by the powerful and transmitted verbatim to the faithful, and how ruthlessly opposition is squelched.  The true victims,besides the truth itself, are the honest, honorable citizens who are misled and manipulated.<br />Fortunately, Brock and a few other brave souls have taken on the job of exposing this power hungry, hypocritical media machine. With daylight, it is to be hoped, the shadows threatening us will withdraw.	2004-06-05

There have been so many publications (one hesitates to call them books) dedicated to the proposition that Bill and Hillary Clinton are devil's spawn or worse that it is now a simple matter to create another.  Just comb through the others, rearrange the charges, insinuations, and generalizations, add a few more if you are so inclined and voila, Regnery or Newsmax or some similar publishing company will be lining up to print it.<br />All this is by way of saying that Rewriting History is yet another hatchet job on Senator Hillary Clinton.  She can't do right, every thing she does do has a political motive, she is treacherous, etc, etc. Most of Rewriting History is devoted to categorizing the numerous times Senator Clinton has not told the truth.  Now it seems to me that being a politician more or less precludes honesty, I'm sorry to say, but having said that I also need to point out that nothing Hillary Clinton has said that is supposedly untrue is all that important anyway.  Who cares if she played soccer in high school or not? Yes, it would be wonderful if she always told the truth, but I don't see anything too unusual in these supposed misstatements.  In fact,  I would be willing to bet that any other politician (even the sainted W himself) would be found to have a pretty long record of untruthful statements if he were subjected to the same sort of sanctimonious, self-righteous scrutiny the Senator and her husband have been under for the last quarter century or so.<br />This brings up another charge made against the Senator, that she is paranoid and highly suspicious of The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy.  Well, pardon me, but isn't there a pretty large amount of evidence to substantiate a certain feeling of &quot;they're out to get us&quot; on the part of the Clinton family?  And if paranoia disqualifies one from public office, then a large portion of the Extreme Right Wing in this country is therefore unelectable (would that it were so!)<br />Another aspect of this work worthy of mention is the cleverness with which Morris makes dark insinuations against the Senator.  For example, he mentions that she worked in the law offices of Robert Treuhaft for a time in the 1970s, and Treuhaft and his wife Jessica Mitford were (gasp) COMMUNISTS back in the 1950s. This is no big secret, Mitford having written a couple of books about her political activities, but mentioning it in this book is a tactic worthy of old Tailgunner Joe McCarthy himself. This Mitford connection, by the way, could also be used to claim that Senator Clinton wants to be in with the British aristocracy or with Fascists (Mitford was daughter of a Lord and sister-in-law of a Duke and of the former leader of the British Fascists.) Mr. Morris overlooked these insinuations, but perhaps he can work them in to a second edition, if there is one.<br />Personally, I have no strong feelings about Senator Clinton's fitness to be President.  If she ever runs for that office, I intend to spend a lot of time examining her record and evaluating her campaign. But one thing that inclines me to be sympathetic to her is the volume and odiousness of the campaign against her as exemplified by works like Rewriting History.  There is an old saying that you are known by your enemies.  Senator Clinton is undoubtedly proud to have enemies like Mr. Morris and his ilk.Right Wing in this country is therefore unelectable (would that it were so!)<br />Another aspect of this work worthy of mention is the cleverness with which Morris makes dark insinuations against the Senator.

Francis Joseph ruled the Hapsburg lands from 1848 to 1916.  He is usually seen as an obtuse, stubborn old autocrat who refused to change with the times and thus doomed his empire to collapse.  Alan Palmer takes a somewhat revisionist view of the Emperor, pointing out that he had a far better mind than he is normally credited with (although handicapped by a very poor education) and was willing to make reforms when necessary (of course he rarely saw the necessity on his own). Even when he did see the need to change, he often waited until it was too late.  For example, in mid 1916 he talked of pulling his country out of World War I in the spring of 1917.  What if he had gone ahead and made peace in the summer of 1916?  Maybe a shorter war, no Russian Revolution, no American intervention, the mind reels with the implications!  But unfortunately he put that decision off and died before he could implement it.<br />The strongest portions of this book deal with Francis Joseph's personal life.  I felt sorry for the poor man, dealing in turn with a bossy mother, a flighty wife he loved dearly, a son who wasted his great abilities and committed suicide, and a host of nephews and cousins who couldn't behave themselves and certainly didn't give him the support he needed. His life was full of losses, a brother executed in Mexico, his wife assassinated, his son a suicide, and finally his nephew and heir's murder bringing on a World War.  At least he had one friend, an actress he visited for years in a platonic relationship.  Its nice to think of him laughing with her over coffee, it must have been the only chance he had to relax!<br />Francis Joseph was not a brilliant or especially bright, but he did his duty as he saw it and stuck to it right to the end.  It is this that makes him admirable today.	2004-06-04

As with her earlier work Queen Victoria's Family, Charlotte Zeepvat has done an excellent job of seeking out many photographs of the more obscure members of the family to give us a more rounded view of the Imperial Family than we usually get from the standard photos seen over and over again.<br />When I looked through this book I was struck by what a good looking group of people the Romanovs were.  The photos are a mixture of formal portraits and snapshots (many taken by the Romanovs themselves), and in most of them the subjects are nice, pleasant seeming people not at all overwhelmed by the formal settings and clothing.  The men mostly seem to have been rugged outdoor types, and the women rather romantic and elegant, with some quite beautiful. The children are really cute, too. Interestingly, most of them are smiling, which is rather unusual for nineteenth century photography. There are even some smiling pictures of Alexandra, the last Tsaritsa, who is usually stone faced in most of her portraits.  Its also interesting to see how the passage of years changed some of the people.  I particularly liked Grand Princess Alexandra Iosipovna, who married one of Nicholas I's sons (and is Prince Philip's great-grandmother).  She went from being a fresh faced young girl to an elegant matron to a magnificent grande dame. Also Grand Princess Maria Pavlovna the elder, whose pictures could be used for a dictionary illustration for &quot;distinguished&quot; or &quot;imposing&quot;. Even though the pictures are all black and white, you can imagine how the jewels must have glittered and the silks and satins gleamed and rustled.<br />The final few pictures showing the post-Revolutionary surviving Romanovs are particularly evocative.  These are people who have lost a lot and endured enormous pain, and it shows on their still dignified, but very sad, faces.<br />This is a book all Romanov aficionados will want.  It will also appeal to anyone interested in photography, fashion, or just human beings themselves.ignified, but very sad, faces.<br />This is a book all Romanov aficionados will want.

After all, it was during the Clinton Administration that the Internet spread into every corner of American society and made sites like the Drudge Report possible.  And it was the various Clinton scandals that fed the drive to create site after site devoted to &quot;news&quot; catering to the Far Right.<br />Instead of being thankful, the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy has now come up with a new charge, that Hillary Clinton did her best to destroy those Internet journalists to keep them from exposing her nefarious dealings as First Lady, and that this campaign has continued now that she is the junior Senator from New York.<br />One's first reaction to this charge is that, if it is true, Senator Clinton is remarkably inept in dealing with her enemies.  There has, after all, been no shortage of Right Wingers on the Internet, talk radio, Fox, and other venues.  One would suppose that if a woman as intelligent as Senator Clinton was really so determined to do away with those who oppose her as this book maintains, that she would do a better job of it.<br />Another interesting but troubling observation about this publication is Mr. Poe's assumption that the Right Wing's campaign against the Clintons was so decent and so upright that any opposition to it, even one orchestrated by the Clintons themselves (and most people would grant them the right of self defense at least), is inherently evil. Thus dissent is sadly confused with disloyalty, and the American tradition of open debate is subverted.  It does not seem to occur to Mr. Poe that such an assumption can work both ways.  One feels certain that Mr. Poe views with equanimity the well known efforts of the present Administration to squelch dissent and label its opponents traitors.<br />It seems fitting to end this review of this revival of McCarthyism with Joseph Welch's famous rebuke to Tailgunner Joe in 1954:  &quot;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?  Have you left no sense of decency?&quot;Joe in 1954:  &quot;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?  Have you left no sense of decency?&quot;	2004-05-19

Judging from the tone of this infelicitous work, the Radical Right Wing is really under pressure.<br />In this work (one hesitates to dignify it with the term book) Steven F. Hayward targets the 39th President (and Nobel laureate) nearly a quarter of a century after he left office.  In common with other publications of this caliber, Mr. Heyward has produced a plethora of hysterical overgeneralizations and pure kerflummery. Those who pause to dig beneath the air of righteous indignation will quickly recognize the shallowness of Mr. Heyward's accusations.  For example, Mr. Heyward charges President Carter with disloyalty because he did not care for Ronald Reagan's policies.  But, after all, wasn't President Carter defeated by Mr. Reagan in 1980?  Is it to be expected that a former adversary would wholeheartedly embrace policies he finds offensive?  Is it really disloyal, as Mr. Heyward implies, to oppose the President? If it is, then one would be safe in assuming that Mr. Heyward and his supporters were in a continuous state of treason from January 20, 1993 to January 20, 2001!  Another of Mr. Heyward's charges is that President Carter has dealt with dictators and undermined the US position repeatedly since leaving office.  While some may disagree with President Carter's actions, to claim that his actions are traitorous is to grossly overstate the case.  Furthermore, to criticize one former President for travelling abroad and meeting with foreign leaders is to make a case for criticizing all of them.  I doubt that Mr. Hayward and his partisans would welcome similar criticisms of Mr. Reagan, Mr. George H. W. Bush, and (it is to be hoped after next January) Mr. George W. Bush.<br />This points out the most disturbing aspect of works of this sort.  By accusing those who disagree with the government of disloyalty, Mr. Heyward and others of his ilk undermine the very institution they claim to defend.  This McCarthyite tactic deserves the same reproof that Joseph Welch delivered to Tailgunner Joe back in 1954: &quot;Have you no sense of decency?&quot;se who disagree with the government of disloyalty, Mr. Heyward and others of his ilk undermine the very institution they claim to defend.

The story stuck with me, and I was glad to find it has been republished and is now available once more.<br />This book is interesting on several levels.  First, Harriet Brown, the young African American college student who goes north to work for the Daleys, an eccentric Vermont farming family, is very appealing, as are most of the rest of the major characters.  Secondly, the book was written during the 1960s civil rights movement and it does a good job of depicting the struggles of that period.  For example, Harriet arrives with a large chip on her shoulder.  She doesn't want to be condescended to or patronized, and she can't figure out what the Daleys want from her.  The Daleys themselves are obviously liberal minded and welcoming, but they can't understand Harriet and her background any more than she understands them.  The third reason to buy this book is that this dilemma is appealingly worked out and is at least on the road to being solved by the end of the book.  Finally, I like this book because it reminds us of the positive side of the 1960s: the idealism, the certainty that people of good will can solve their problems by listening and seeking understanding.  Its a good book to read in this cynical day and age.	2004-05-18

Nigel Hamilton covers Clinton's life up to his election in November 1992.  He does a great job of describing Clinton's background, parentage, and early years.  I realized for the first time (and I have read numerous Clinton studies) just how poor and unprivileged a background the President came from, and how truly remarkable it was that anyone with so many strikes agaisnt him rose so far so quickly.  Hamilton also provides some interesting psychological insights into Clinton's well known moral weaknesses and failings, so that the reader gets a better understanding of this enormously complex (and very human) individual.  Hamilton does an excellent job of covering the historic events which influenced Clinton's growth, so that this is not just a biography, but a history of modern America and the world.<br />Clinton phobics will not enjoy this book because it is truly &quot;fair and balanced.&quot; But if you are looking for the truth, and would like some insights into President Clinton before reading his own memoirs, this book is an excellent beginning.	2004-05-18

First Erik Larson gives us the fascinating story of the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893.  This World's Fair was a demonstration that America, particularly Midwestern America, could compete successfully with the Old World.  Larson describes the intricate planning and painstaking attention to detail that accompanied every day of the fair, and introduces us to the many personalities like Frederick Law Olmsted who made the fair a reality.<br />Running alongside the story of the fair itself is the tale of a pyschopathic personality who imprisoned and murdered numerous young women and children while the fair was going on.  The tale of this criminal's career and the steps taken to finally track him down and punish him is just as fascinating as the story of the fair itself.<br />To sum up, this book's story of the Columbian Exposition is a wonderful history lesson.  Its story of the psychotic murder is a tale worthy of Alfred Hitchcock himself.  Such a combination is a rarity to be savored.	2004-05-17

First, it covers a fascinating period of English and European history, the late 1400s when the Europeans were beginning to stretch beyond their own borders into other continents like Africa and the Americas.  At the same time the European nation states were in the final stages of coalescence, so that terms like &quot;England&quot; and &quot;France&quot; were beginning to have more than just rough geographical meanings.  Secondly, I liked this book for its detailed coverage of the mystery of the vanished Princes and whether or not Perkin Warbeck was actually Richard, Duke of York. This is one of the oldest European historical mysteries, but it is just as intriguing as more modern conundrums, such as what happened to the Dauphin in 1793 or to two of the last Tsar's children in 1918.  Thirdly, this book is beautifully written, with fine psychological insights into Perkin himself, King Henry VII, Margaret of Burgundy, and numerous others who tend to be considered mere names in dry as dust annals.<br />So I recommend this book to students of royal and/or English history and to anyone who enjoys a fine, well told tale of mystery and intrigue.	2004-05-09

Books	4	38	48	N	N	Well Organized, But Not Necessarily Original	David Fromkin has produced a convenient summary of the events of the summer of 1914.  If you want to know what happened on one particular day during those fateful July and August weeks, this book is particularly suitable in that it covers events day by day and almost hour by hour. The short, choppy chapters tend to be repetitive at times, and Fromkin's tendency to refer to other authors' ideas can be annoying if, like most of us, one is not familiar with their writings.<br />Fromkin's most interesting point is that the war was actually two conflicts: one a local Austrian-Serbian conflict that was quickly forgotten by everyone else, and the second a long planned move by the Germans to prevent what they saw as their inevitable decline in Europe. In light of recent events in Iraq, Fromkin also does a good job of explaining how carefully laid plans can spin out of control and turn what was planned to be a short war into a long drawn out quagmire.<br />This is a short summary of a very complex subject.  It will be satisfactory for those who want or need a quick look at the beginning of the Great War.  Those who desire a more indepth study should refer to the classic: Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August.	2004-04-08

If you are an aficionado of royal histories from that period you've probably already read quite a bit about the subjects presented here, like the missing Dauphin or Kaspar Hauser or Fedor Kuzmich, but nevertheless its nice to have the stories encapsulated in a quick, well written series of chapters like this one.  Its also interesting to see how much DNA has been used in recent years to help verify or debunk some of these stories.  Some of the selections seem a bit off, for example the story of the Tichborne Claimant is interesting history but it could hardly be considered a case of a missing heir, being actually a pretty obvious case of attempted fraud, but that is no reason not to enjoy this book.	2004-03-28

Clarke was America's senior counter terrorism expert during four Administrations, and his memoir provides a rare eyewitness account of the events of the 1980s and 1990s which led up to 9/11. Unlike most purported histories of the period which have been published in recent months, Clarke does not have an ideological axe to grind.  He merely wants to tell the truth as he saw it.  As such, this book will be an important resource for many years to come.<br />Clarke is that now rare individual who can put principle above politics.  Its pretty obvious that he is a Republican, but he provides an honest assessment of the Reagan, GHW Bush, Clinton, and GW Bush Administrations and their successes and failures in dealing with terrorism.  Each of the first three Presidencies comes in for criticism as well as blame.  The only Administration which failed utterly, in his view, is the present one, and he marshalls an impressive array of evidence to support his stand.  From the first few pages, which describe the scramble in the White House as 9/11 unfolded, through the entire book, Clarke points out the failures of Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld and Company to come to grips with the danger Al Qaeda presented and then to deal effectively with the menace once it had been thrust in their faces.  The most heartfelt sections deal with the bizarre decision to use 9/11 as a pretext to move against Iraq in defiance of all the evidence Clarke had to present.  Clarke's descriptions of the Bush team's single minded determination to go after Saddam rather than Al Qaeda and other missteps ought to be major campaign topics this fall.<br />Richard A. Clarke is a good man and a good American.  It is to be hoped that after next January 20th he will have the chance to serve yet another Administration.  He and the country deserve much better than what we have now.	2004-03-28

Paul Waldman has investigated the strategy by which this uninspiring twig from one of the least distinguished American political families in history rose to power.<br />Waldman also reveals the complicity of most of the American media, which wilfully ignored Bush's misstatements and lies in the 2000 campaign and painted Bush as a good old boy with an awshucks attitude.<br />It is fortunate that this book has appeared now and can be used during the 2004 campaign.  Hopefully this time the media won't have its blinders on and nothing W., Karl Rove, and the other henchmen can do can foist another four years of gibberish, war, and economic collapse down our throats.	2004-02-29

Emmett Tyrrell has made something of a career for himself bashing the Clinton family.  In this book, for which he has been joined by Mark W. Davis, he continues to take the low road he began with The American Spectator and Boy Clinton.<br />Mr. Tyrell and Mr. Davis pretend intimate knowledge of Senator Clinton's future plans.  Since I doubt either of them has ever spoken more than a few words with her at most, the source of this knowledge must remain mysterious.  In common with other entries in the hate Clinton oeuvre, paranoid speculations, hysterical overgeneralizations, and pure kerflummery make up the bulk of this slim volume, accentuated with an air of righteous indignation.<br />A major feature of Mr. Tyrrell and Mr. Davis' production is their air of snobbery.  Obviously the Clintons are just not good enough to share the same planet with them.  Somehow I don't think this bothers President and Senator Clinton one bit, which undoubtedly annoys Mr. Tyrrell and Mr. Davis immensely.<br />Another aspect worthy of note are the continuous efforts by the authors to be witty and debonair. Unfortunately, these efforts fall far short of humor and struggle to reach the level of snottiness one might find scribbled on the walls of a junior high school boys' bathroom.  A few examples will suffice:  They think it clever to call Senator Clinton's book Livid History.  Pictures of her many hairstyles arouse great hilarity. A photo of the Senator shading her eyes becomes a practice military salute.  Somehow they weren't able to find a photo of the Senator making an apparent Sieg Heil! or raising the clenched fist of Marxism, but I'm sure its not for lack of effort. Beneath all the merry fun making, a careful reader can hear Mr. Tyrrell and Mr. Davis' teeth grinding, since no amount of smugness can conceal two Presidential terms, a Senate election, high popularity ratings, and a best selling book.<br />People with Mr. Tyrrell and Mr. Davis' creative imaginations ought to busy themselves with more worthy projects than this.  (Perhaps they should look into creating an adulatory biography of George W. Bush.) As for President and Senator Clinton, there is an old saying &quot;You are known by your enemies.&quot;  The Clintons are undoubtedly proud of such enemies as these.emselves with more worthy projects than this.

It appeals on two levels: first to Tolkien enthusiasts who are always eager to learn more about our favorite author's life and sources of inspiration, and secondly to anyone interested in World War I and the experiences of the ordinary soldiers who fought and died in it.<br />The book begins in pre war England with J.R.R. Tolkien and his small cluster of friends.  Beginning with their schoolboy days at King Edward's School in Birmingham and continuing through the beginnings of their academic careers at Oxford and Cambridge, Tolkien (John Ronald in those days) had a close friendship with a group of highly intelligent kindred souls who formed the TCBS, or Tea Cake and Barrovian Society.  Partly literary and partly just for fun, the TCBS must have been one of hundreds of similar societies founded in the semi-cloistered world of schoolboys.  Unlike most such groups, the TCBS lived on in the hearts of its participants, four of whom, John Ronald Tolkien, Christopher Wiseman, Geoffrey Bache Smith, and Robert Gilson, were particularly close.  They encouraged each other in their literary and artistic pursuits and by their early twenties were already producing work which boded well for their futures.<br />Then World War I broke out.  Tolkien, Gilson, Wiseman, and Smith were sucked into the British armed forces along with thousands of other men, Wiseman into the navy, the others into the army.  Gilson and Smith were killed in 1916 (Smith's letter to Tolkien about Gilson's death, ending with &quot;My dear John Ronald  whatever are we going to do?&quot; is one of the saddest things I have ever read.) Tolkien and Wiseman survived and never forgot their dead friends. We also see the quiet, loving influence of friends and family, particularly that of Edith Bratt Tolkien, on the two survivors.<br />The heart of this book deals with the influence of the War on Tolkien's writings on Middle earth.  I will never be able to read of the Fall of Gondolin again without thinking of the Somme, and never think of Eressea without remembering Tolkien returning home on a hospital ship to see the green hills of England once more.  So much of Tolkien's heart and inspiration is revealed in this book that it should be shelved alongside his own masterpieces.rth.

Otto von Hapsburg, born in 1912,was the son of the last Emperor of Austria-Hungary.  His parents were overthrown in late 1918 and young Otto, whose own memories of his childhood are astonishingly vivid, began a life of exile.<br />Otto had every right to be bitter over the hand fate dealt him, but we see very little of such an emotion in his life.  Instead, we see a man whose dedication to Austria and Hungary (and later to all of Europe) never wavered.  He stood by his homelands and was their most fervent advocate even in the dark days of World War II and the Cold War.  He was ambitious yet honorable, as we see repeatedly when he refused to have anything to do with Hitler, for example.<br />Otto's most important contributions came towards the end of his life, when he became one of the first members of the European Parliament.  For twenty years he was a steadfast advocate of greater European unity, but within a setting in which tradition, custom, and above all established religion were not ignored. He was also a devoted family man, marrying rather late in life and fathering a large brood of children.<br />So although Otto von Hapsburg did not achieve the status he was born to, he nevertheless made a positive contribution to the world, something his ancestors, many of whom held more power but had far less stature, would certainly be proud of.	2004-02-16

He has revived H. Beam Piper's Paratime concept of multiple Earths on different time tracks (which can be visited by those with the right technology).  This provides unlimited numbers of possible alternate worlds for Turtledove to explore.<br />Gunpowder Empire takes a late twenty-first century American family to an alternate world where the Roman Empire never fell.  They do business there in order to provide scarce resources to their own world, and for a time all seems well.  Then the mother gets very ill and she and her husband return to their own world, leaving their two teenage children behind.  Then the technology breaks down, and the children are left on their own, possibly for the rest of their lives.<br />Turtledove has not only revived Piper's idea of Crosstime traffic, he has also hearkened back to Robert Heinlein's juvenile science fiction works of the 1950s and 1960s. At the same time he has provided some thought provoking commentary on war and on gender roles and relationships which give the book more depth.  This is the beginning of a fine new series which I hope will see many additions.	2004-02-16

The British Empire forced China's Qing Dynasty to allow huge shipments of opium into its territories in order to reduce Britain's huge trade deficit.  The details of how Britain contributed to the decline of China are astounding but well documented.<br />A particularly interesting aspect of this book are the numerous references to and comparisons with present day issues and situations.  The writing is scholarly but highly readable.  Those who read it will have a better understanding of a less than glorious period of British history and a new appreciation of the anger and distrust China still feels towards the West as a result.	2004-02-08

He received a fine education at Marlborough and Cambridge and became one of the most acclaimed art historians and teachers in Britain in the twentieth century.  At the same time, he was a spy for the Soviets.  The story of how Blunt became a communist, worked against his country while supposedly serving it in MI5 during World War II, then became a courtier for two monarchs and the highly regarded head of the Courtald Institute, which he made into one of the finest art schools in the country, is fascinating.<br />Blunt was a man of many contradictions.  At the same time he stood at the side of the Royal Family as the Surveyor of their art collection he was leading a secret gay life notorious for its seaminess.  While he appeared to be a pillar of the Establishment he gave secret information to the Soviets and became the long sought after Fourth Man who was in league with Burgess, Maclean, and Philby before they defected to Russia. When he was unmasked in the 1960s the British government did its own contradictory little dance around him, granting him immunity while pumping him for information.<br />Miranda Carter is sympathetic to Blunt and emphasizes his positives, like his fine teaching abilities and helpfulness to many of his students, but without whitewashing his treasonous activities.  She helps us understand the pressure Blunt was under for many years and the fear of being unmasked that dominated him until he was finally publically denounced in 1979. Above all, she does a fine job of depicting the man's numerous contradictions.  Highly recommended.	2004-02-08

He has now brought the trilogy to a close with A Splendor of Letters, which is just as fascinating as either of the first two volumes.<br />A Splendor of Letters is a wide ranging look at many aspects of the book world.  History is served through an examination of several attempts to destroy the written word, from Nazi Germany to Pol Pot's Cambodia; and with happier stories of archaeologists' rediscoveries of ancient libraries.  More stories of book collectors of the sort that made A Gentle Madness so interesting are also provided, as is more material on the problems libraries and collections have when they run out of space and must determine what to do with the overflow, which was a major topic in Patience and Fortitude.  The main thrust of A Splendor of Letters, however, is a defense of the book in its traditional form against those who would proclaim its death at the hands of technology.<br />As with all of Mr. Basbanes' works (which also include Among the Gently Mad, A Primer for Book Collectors), the fascinating material is enhanced by the beauty of the writing.  No book lover should pass this by.	2004-01-27

Ehrman writes in an accessible but highly scholarly style meant for the general reader.  He explains the differences between Ebionites and Marcionites, as well as a host of other varieties of Christians, and illuminates the process through which the proto-Orthodox view of Christianity became the only acceptable version of that faith. Along the way he tells many fascinating stories and introduces us to some intriguing and in many cases heroic characters like Polycarp, Ignatius, and many others. He also has some interesting counter-factual speculations on what could have happened had Marcionism, for example, become the dominant form of Christianity.<br />Many Christians have always assumed that the religious principles and practices that we have been brought up with were always  a part of our faith, and that all Christians have always believed pretty much the same thing about the nature of Jesus and His relationship with God.  This book helps us recognize that the true story of the early years of our faith is far more complicated than most of us ever knew.	2004-01-19

The parts of the book which deal with the discovery of the body and the subsequent investigations read like any report of a murder might, with heavy emphasis on detail and comparisons of witness testimony, etc.<br />The most important parts of the book deal, however, with the reaction of the townspeople to the murder: an upsurge in anti-Semitic hysteria which eventually forced the government to send troops to keep order.  Smith does a good job of analyzing the roots of anti-Jewish prejudice in Germany and Central Europe and provides a fascinating history of the beginnings of the so-called blood libel and desecration of the Host stories, belief in which accounted for much of the anti-Jewish feeling in Central and Eastern Europe from the Middle Ages on. Smith also draws some interesting parallels with the behavior of the German government in 1900, when it actively protected its Jewish citizens, and then in the 1940s, when the Third Reich actively sought to massacre those same citizens.<br />This book is important because it gives us precious insights into the tendency of human beings, even well educated, civilized humans, to lapse into hysteria and believe the most unbelievable stories about people they once trusted and accepted.  Read this book, and remember it the next time you hear rumors about child molesting day care workers, or secret covens of Satanists among us, or other widespread, previously unsuspected, conspiracies.	2004-01-19

He shows us the Greek origins of many of our ideas about government, literature, and art, and ends with a chapter that demonstrates the intersections between the Greeks and the Judeo-Christian ideas which came to dominate so much of the world.

He was a member of one of Russia's most aristocratic families, and in this memoir, originally published in the 1950s, he gives us a glimpse of life for a nobleman in pre-Revolutionary Russia.<br />Life was certainly rich, if not always good, for Prince Felix.  As a younger son, he was given very little education and basically allowed to do as he pleased during his formative years.  Most of the time what he was pleased to do was to get into trouble.  I lost count of the number of servants, governesses, and other retainers who quit with nervous breakdowns after trying to look after Felix. Under the influence of his elder brother, whom he adored, Felix had an early initiation into sexual and other kinds of debauchery. He enjoyed dressing as a woman and living the high life in St. Petersburg, London, and Paris.  Felix was reticent about his sexuality, claiming several affairs with women but speaking more warmly about his men friends, including Grand Duke Dmitri, who helped him murder Rasputin.  When Felix's brother was killed in a duel Felix became the heir to a vast fortune.  He married Tsar Nicholas' niece Irina, whom he claimed to adore but otherwise said little about.<br />The most interesting parts of this book deal with Rasputin, whom Felix met several times.  Typically, Felix hints that there was a sexual nature to these encounters, but divulges few details.  Felix describes the murder and his subsequent exile, which saved him from being in St. Petersburg during the February Revolution in 1917, and his internment in the Crimea with other members of the Imperial Family from 1917 through 1919, when he escaped on a British warship.<br />This book is interesting but highly reticent.  Felix never loses a chance to glamorize himself and his activities, with the result that some undeniably brave actions, like his several trips to St. Petersburg to rescue treasures while the Bolshevik terror was at its height, tend to get less attention than they deserve.  A more open and informative biography of Prince Felix, The Man Who Killed Rasputin, by Greg King, was published several years ago and will help fill in the gaps left by Felix's own work.cue treasures while the Bolshevik terror was at its height, tend to get less attention than they deserve.

Turtledove always does an impressive job with historical detail, but tends to focus on far too many characters with the result that his books like The Great War series tend to be historically fascinating but confusing to keep up with in the matter of who is doing what to whom.  Fortunately he has limited his characters here and has taken the time to fully portray them as real people, not cardboard cutouts.<br />In In The Presence of Mine Enemies, like The Guns of the South, Turtledove takes a fantastic premise, that the Third Reich won World Wars Two and Three and has lasted until about the year 2010, and makes it all too believable.  We travel through the Nazified splendors of Berlin and hear as a matter of course of details like Omaha as the US capital (Washington was nuclear bombed in World War III circa 1970). Then we learn something even more fantastic, that all of Turtledove's major characters are Jews, living hidden, secret lives in the heart of Fascism.  The shock is just as great as when the twenty-first century time travelers show up with Kalashnikovs at General Lee's encampment in Guns of the South.<br />In writing this book Turtledove obviously drew on material from the last years of the Soviet Union, and it is easy to recognize which Nazi leader is patterned on which Soviet counterpart.  The true main story, that of the hidden Jews and their constant fear of discovery, is totally original and completely absorbing.<br />The book ends with a failed coup against a reforming Fuhrer, and those of us familiar with Russian history in the last ten years or so can guess what's coming next: turmoil, corruption, independence movements, fledgling attempts at democracies failing more often than succeeding, etc. What is less clear is how Turtledove's characters are going to survive all this, and whether they will ever be free to live openly as Jews once more.  The book ends at a point which leaves the question of sequels open.  I hope the answer will be yes.book ends at a point which leaves the question of sequels open.

In my opinion she was less talented than her older sister Nancy (talented novelist, biographer, and wit) and her next to youngest sister Jessica (one time Communist, muckraker, and wit).  She was ambitious to marry well like her baby sister Deborah (Duchess of Devonshire) and managed to wed two prominent men, one a wealthy future Lord, the other a baronet with what looked like a prominent political future.  Unfortunately the sister she most resembles was Unity, a Nazi enthusiast and Hitler hanger on. (The other sister, Pam, was a lover of the countryside and rural life, neither of which had much appeal to Diana.)<br />Diana was an intelligent woman who was largely self educated.  She made her first marriage at 18 to Bryan Guiness, who loved her for the rest of his life.  Unfortunately, husbandly devotion and two sons were not enough for Diana, who fell in love with Sir Oswald Mosley in her early twenties.  Mosley was a rising political star, having moved from the Conservatives to Labour to his own New Party to forming the British Union of Fascists in the early 1930s.  De Courcy does a good job of describing Mosley's political appeal as a strong man who could be trusted to put things right (like Mussolini).  In the Depression years he must have seemed an appealing alternative to politics as usual in Britain.  Diana lived with Mosley and after the death of his first wife married him in Berlin, with Hitler as a wedding guest.<br />Here is the most enigmatic part of Diana's story.  How could an intelligent, pleasant, vivacious woman fall so heavily for the Nazis?  De Courcy tries to answer this in terms of Diana's attraction to strong men, but this doesn't seem to be the full story.  Whatever the attraction, it was life long and survived every revelation of Hitler's true character after World War II.  Diana and her husband Mosley were so committed to Hitler and Fascism that they suffered imprisonment during much of World War II as possible subversives, and were ostracized by much of polite society and the British political world for the rest of their lives.<br />None of this seemed to matter to Diana.  She remained at Mosley's side through what must have been several of his extra-marital affairs (the word that seems to best sum up Oswald Mosley is \\"cad\\") and dominated a large family of children and step children and other descendants.  She carried grudges with a vengeance, not speaking to her sister Jessica for years (Jessica had no use for her, either) and lambasting her step son for not sufficiently praising his father's memory in a biography.  At the same time she was evidently charming, witty, and a delight to be around right up to her death in August 2003.

And the Dead Shall Rise is a superb work of scholarship and journalism.  It begins with little Mary's ill fated trip to her workplace in April, 1913 to pick up her pay from Leo Frank,then continues through the discovery of her body in the factory basement,and the subsequent investigation, arrest, and trial of Frank.  This was surely one of the first trials of the century for the twentieth century, and Oney takes us through it step by step and witness by witness.<br />After the trial ends with Frank's conviction, Oney chronicles the media frenzy, both pro- and anti-Frank, that swept Georgia and the nation.  He details the long appeals process and, when that ended with Frank's conviction confirmed, examines the process by which Georgia's Governor Slaton commuted the death sentence.  It is here that the story becomes even more chilling, as Oney details Frank's life in the Milledgeville prison on the one hand and describes the plans being laid to lynch him on the other.<br />I don't believe a full listing of the men involved in Leo Frank's lynching in August, 1915 has ever been published before now.  Oney names names, extremely prominent ones in many cases, and fully describes Frank's kidnapping and lynching and the gruesome aftermath when thousands flocked to see his body.  The book ends with summings up of the subsequent careers of most of the most prominent characters in the affair.<br />Reading this book was a real shock to me.  As a native Georgian I had heard of the Frank case for years.  This book was the first time I fully appreciated the frenzy that swept over the state and the stain it left on us for years. I was shocked by the depths of the anti-Semitism and hatred of non-Southerners revealed amongst Georgians at the time.  This book needs to be read by everyone, regardless of your background or heritage, in order to remind us of the anger and hatred that can arise within us.ime.

Vidal's elegant, waspish wit makes this book (along with everything else he writes) a delight, but the true value of this work lies in its content.<br />Vidal makes it clear in his afterword that the book was inspired by a brief conversation he had with John F. Kennedy in November 1961.  Kennedy wondered why we had no great men of the caliber of the Founding Fathers in his own time (how depressed he would have been had he lived forty more years and witnessed our present crop of &quot;leaders&quot;!!)  Vidal doesn't really give us a clear answer to Kennedy's question, but he does manage, in less than 200 pages, to remind us of both the Founders' human frailties and their greatness.  With Vidal Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, and many others don't come out as icons, but neither are they the villains some would make them.  One finishes this book in an hour or so aware that the men who created our nation were human after all, but intelligent and dedicated men who compare rather well with their successors in 2003.	2003-11-16

There's a lot of material there, much of it gleaned from evidence found in classical mythology and Homer's epics.  Mayor's dedication to arcane research makes her conclusions about the use of infectious disease, poisonous reptiles and insects, and primitive but effective chemical weaponry comprehensible and convincing.  Obviously, warfare in the ancient world was even dirtier, smellier, and nastier than it is today. Mayor also draws some interesting parallels between chemical warfare in ancient times and more recently, with some amazing new material.  (The British actually used gas in Iraq before Saddam did!!)<br />My only regret about this book is that it is limited pretty strictly to the classical or ancient world, finishing up with a brief look at the Mongols' use of plague stricken bodies as projectiles against a city they were besieging in the 1300s.  There is obviously plenty of material for a sequel, which I hope Mayor will eventually provide.	2003-11-16

Massie has produced another masterpiece of narrative history, comprehensive without being dry and fascinating in every detail.  In Castles of Steel he takes up the story he started with his 1991 bestseller Dreadnought:  the struggle between Britain and Germany for sea mastery during the Great War.<br />The book begins with the final days of peace in July 1914, when Europe realized that the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand was about to trigger a major war.  Massie describes the calculations of the British and German leadership as they moved toward conflict.  One of Massie's greatest skills as a writer is his ability to create short but thorough biographical sketches, seen here most vividly in his treatments of Jellicoe and Beatty, the men who were to lead the British Grand Fleet. Massie also has an eye for odd humorous moments, as in his amusing description of the trick a German ship played on an unsuspecting French colony soon after war was declared.<br />After the war actually begins Massie focusses on the manuevers of the British and German fleets as they prepare for action.  Another narrative track traces the steps of the politicians like Winston Churchill and Prince Louis of Battenberg who are setting war policy.  Massie's main focus is on the British, and he thoroughly analyzes successes like the Battle of Dogger Bank and disasters like the Gallipoli landings.  The climax of the book is the Battle of Jutland in 1916, which was the only major clash between the two navies.  Massie also documents the submarine war and details how it eventually brought the United States into the conflict.  The last few pages of the book describes the scuttling of the surrendered German fleet at Scapa Flow, symbolic of the enormous waste caused by the whole conflict.<br />Castles of Steel is a fitting companion to Dreadnought and will certainly be considered one of the most comprehensive, yet accessible, histories of the Great War.	2003-11-13

Throughout his over long political career Zell Miller has fluctuated throughout the spectrum with only one constant:  what he perceives to be his own best interest in pursuit of his driving ambition.<br />A brief summary of Mr. Miller's career is in order.  He entered Georgia politics in the 1960s as a lackey for the clownish segregationist Governor Lester Maddox.  Elected Lieutenant Governor in 1974, he developed a reputation as a maverick progressive/liberal during the Carter Administration.  In 1980 he ran a liberal/populist primary challenge to Senator Herman Talmadge (who won the primary but lost the general election).  Licking his wounds, Miller kept a low profile in the 1980s as Lieutenant Governor to two Governors.  In 1990 he ran as a moderate Democrat and was elected Governor with support from organized labor.  Once in office, Miller then proceeded to swing to the right for most of 1991, antagonizing many supporters and causing them to wonder if they had elected a Republican after all.  Then in 1992, sensing a shift in the political winds, he came out strongly for Bill Clinton, moving the Georgia primary up so that it gave Clinton a needed boost in his quest for the nomination.  That summer he gave the keynote address at the Democratic convention and was one of the Democrats' strongest Southern supporters.  I was present at a campaign rally in Atlanta for Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al and Tipper Gore in the fall of 1992.  Zell gave a stemwinding classical Democratic speech praising the Clinton-Gore campaign to the skies.  He was instrumental in delivering Georgia to the Clinton column in November.  Miller continued his progressive politics in 1993 when he made a principled stand for changing the Georgia flag's Confederate symbolism.  Although he abandoned this plan in the face of opposition, the flag issue and his association with the Clintons nearly cost Miller his reelection in 1994.  In his second term Miller moved steadily rightward and sought no bold initiatives(although he did seek to mend fences with the teachers' union by sponsoring a series of raises, for which I, as an educator, must give him some gratitude), finishing up in 1998 with a pledge to retire from politics forever.  Then in 1999 with the death of Paul Coverdell Miller was appointed to the US Senate, winning election to the rest of Coverdell's term that fall.  True to form, he wavered between the Democrats and the Republicans for his first few months before deciding that the GOP had a better shot at power in 2000. Since then he has been a shill for Bush and his cronies and a Democrat only in name.  If all the votes had been permitted to be counted in Florida, and Al Gore were now in the White House, Zell would have written a book about the great tradition of Southern liberalism and the perfidiousness of Republicans.<br />The sad thing about Zell Miller in his current mutation is that he knows better.  He knows what the Democratic Party has done for the South over the years.  He is not a natural ally of Bush and his crony capitalists, but a man whose family, state, and region have been helped immeasurably by Democratic initiatives throughout his lifetime.  To stab his party in the back, as Miller has done repeatedly, is the rankest ingratitude and, in anyone else, would reveal an appalling ignorance of history.  Miller cannot hide behind ignorance, he is too smart and too well educated for that.  Instead, he must stand accused of rank ambition and self-glorification.  His book reveals no true understanding of the South or of history.  It is a hatchet job that could have been created by any Karl Rove acolyte and as such, it stands as the last miserable statement of the inglorious career of a man who wasted his considerable talents.tion in 1994.

Paul Krugman is an economics professor who actually manages to make his subject interesting.  In this collection of columns from The New York Times, revised and expanded for this book, Krugman analyzes what went wrong over the last few years.  In the late 1990s the US looked forward to the twentyfirst century with the prospect of rising budget surpluses and prosperity.  Now we face an uncertain future, dominated by the necessity to deal with increasingly huge budget deficits and the concomitant economic woes that they will bring with them.  How did this happen?<br />Krugman pulls no punches.  He places the blame for the present state of affairs squarely on the shoulders of the Bush Administration and its allies in Congress and elsewhere.  Krugman correctly identifies these people not as conservatives but as radicals, out to force their extremist, reactionary ideology on the nation.<br />With the media increasingly either pro-Bush or too frightened of him to speak out, and with the Democrats in similar disarray, Paul Krugman's book could not have come out at a better time. We can hope that the book will find a wide audience throughout the country as the 2004 election draws near, and that it spurs dissent and revulsion against the Bush team next November.	2003-10-26

His work does stand out a bit since he seems to have a firmer sense of literary style, but this is scarcely to his credit since it proves he ought to be producing worthier publications, such as a defense of the George W. Bush record.  But then again, such a defense is probably beyond anyone's powers.<br />Mr. Lowry claims that President Clinton was primarily concerned with his legacy.  Now isn't that shocking:  a President of the United States was worried about history and the effects of his policies on the future!  Mr. Lowry also claims that President Clinton was willing to take risks only on sexual matters.  Perhaps Mr. Lowry can explain the sexual nature of the 1993 budget, the health care plan, the Mexico bailout of 1995, or the NAFTA agreement, to name a few Clinton initiatives which were quite risky but not overtly titillating (at least not to me.)<br />One of the chief charges Republicans make against Democrats these days is that of elitism.  It is therefore surprising that Mr. Lowry spends quite a bit of time sneering at President Clinton's poor white Southern ancestry and upbringing.  He also ventures into amateur psychology to state that a deprived childhood can lead to licentiousness later.  Maybe so, but Mr. Lowry really ought to keep in mind that white Southerners from similar backgrounds make up a key element in George W. Bush's support these days, and they might not appreciate his contemptuous tone.<br />Mr. Lowry provides several chapters designed to prove that everything positive that happened between January 20, 1993 and January 20, 2001 was mere coincidence, while every negative event between those dates  was directly caused by Clintonian malfeasance.  None of this is new material, but the elaborate circumlocutions of logic make for amusing though quaint reading.  There is also a retread of the tired old Lewinsky affair, just in case his readers have become satiated with the fifteen or twenty other publications on the same subject.  Mr. Lowry's inventive attempts to pin responsibility on President Clinton for the Sept 11 attacks are somewhat diverting.  (Clinton's gall is incredible, out of office nine months and still running things!)<br />In the short run publications like this one are designed to divert attention (and blame) away from the Bush Administration.  In the long run they are designed to permanently blacken Clinton's name in the history books.  Neither will succeed.  Americans are perfectly capable of seeing the truth now and years from now, and no blatantly partisan smear tactics will mislead them for long.  There is an old saying:  \\"You are known by your enemies.\\"  President Clinton is probably quite proud to have as enemies the authors of this sort of publication.also a retread of the tired old Lewinsky affair, just in case his readers have become satiated with the fifteen or twenty other publications on the same subject.

Bush: Mastering the Politics of Deception	Books	5	74	93	N	N	An Overdue Indictment	At last someone has penetrated the thick fog of hagiography surrounding the present occupant of the Oval Office.  Here we have a really penetrating analysis of George W. Bush's lies, evasions, lies, misstatements, lies, prevarications, and lies both before and after he was appointed to office.  Each lie is presented, then elegantly and clearly dissected.  Along the way we learn some fascinating (albeit sometimes nauseating) facts about W's checkered past that reveal him to be quite different from the paragon of virtue presented to us by Republican propagandists.  There is also a well documented critique and castigation of the role the press played in the 2000 election, when Mr. Bush essentially got off scot free.<br />In this well researched and organized book I  take exception to only one assertion by Mr. Corn:  that Bush grew and matured in the period after Sept. 11.  How I wish that were so, but unfortunately I feel that subsequent events prove that Bush didn't really change; we Americans, in our fear and panic, just hoped and convinced ourselves that he had. Now that the scales have started to fall from our eyes, it is to be hoped that no amount of Florida skullduggery or collusion on the Supreme Court can keep W. in office beyond January 20, 2005.	2003-10-19

I say supposedly because this book turns out not to be about religious freedom at all, but rather a political tome aimed at advancing the cause of the Radical Right.<br />Undoubtedly there have been cases where overzealous officials have misinterpreted court decisions to the point where they have banned the most innocent displays of religious belief.  A worthwhile study of this regrettable phenomenon (such as Stephen Carter's The Culture of Disbelief) would discuss these cases, point out the errors, and provide guidance for setting things right.  Mr. Limbaugh, however, is not writing to illuminate but to deceive.  The purpose of his exagerrated accounts (does anyone truly call the Bible a hate book) is to so alarm the truly religious among us that they provide political support to Mr. Limbaugh and his cohorts.<br />There would be nothing wrong with Mr. Limbaugh's writing a book  expressing his disagreement with the progressive agenda and providing conservative alternatives. There is something very wrong with this book, however, because he does not debate the issues but instead seeks to tar liberalism with the stain of anti-religious zealotry.  This type of political warfare has become all too common in our society and will probably intensify as the 2004 election draws nearer.  It is a disgrace to the nation, and those who practice such cynical, glib manipulation should be treated with contempt and hounded from office.	2003-10-05

Some of the stories, like Puss-cat Mew, Tolkien actually acknowledged having read and enjoyed as a youth.  Others are not actually mentioned by Tolkien but possibly had an influence on him, while still others were probably not read by him but are indicative of the state of fantasy at the time he was active.  None of these stories really measure up to Tolkien's standards (but then, what does?) but many are quite interesting and enjoyable to read.  Each story has a brief sidebar giving some details about the author, and there is more information in a suggested reading section at the back.

This is a subject which has been covered many times, but never so thoroughly as have Greg King and Penny Wilson, who document almost every step Nicholas, Alexandra, their children and faithful servants took from Tsarskoe Seloe to Ekaterinburg. In the process, many romantic and political cobwebs have been swept away from the story of the last Tsar, his family and associates, and their fates.<br />There is no doubt that Nicholas II was a good and loving husband and father, but King and Wilson also depict his frustrating fatalism and passivity (and anti-Semitism which was extraordinary even by the standards of his time).  Similarly, Alexandra was a devoted mother but possessive to the point of neurosis with her husband and children.  The five children were normal adolescents, not angels.  Most interestingly, the loyal servants who died with the family are here given biographies and personalities for the first time, as are the Ekaterinburg guards, who were not brutes but young men and boys who developed warm (sometimes romantic) feelings for their captives and wept over their bodies. (Some even committed suicide in remorse.) King and Wilson describe how the legend of the saintly family and their brutal imprisonment developed out of political and religious considerations well after the events took place, and document the real story for the first time. They do a particularly good job of exposing the anti-Semitic intentions of many of the first investigations of the murders, which were apparently undertaken not so much as to solve the mystery as to blame the whole thing on the Communists and Jews.<br />The period leading up to the massacre is carefully reconstructed.  King and Wilson absolve Lenin of directly ordering the murders and maintain the decision was made by a panicky Ural Soviet as an army which would have rescued the Tsar closed in on Ekaterinburg.  The massacre itself is described in every gory detail, as is the long drawn out and bumbling process through which the bodies were removed and buried.<br />Here King and Wilson would like to find a way to revive the Anastasia controversy, but even though Anastasia and Alexis are undeniably missing from their family's grave, they can find no evidence that anyone was able to escape.  The mystery of the two missing bodies will have to remain a mystery until someone finally finds their burial site in that forest outside Ekaterinburg.<br />In the final chapters King and Wilson provide some updated information about the rediscovery of the bodies in the 1970s and early 1990s, with some indications that the Soviet and later Russian governments were heavily involved in making sure the investigations came out without too many embarrassing details being revealed.  More recent material on the DNA analysis of the bones is also included, but there's nothing that alters the certain identification of the imperial family and their servants.<br />The investigation and the DNA research lead into the controversies over the funeral held in St. Petersburg in 1998 and the differing positions of several branches of the Russian Orthodox Church on whether the family should have been beatified or given lesser honors.  King and Wilson also touch upon the split within the present day Romanov family itself, but are clearly supportive of the Vladimirovichi side and dismissive of the rights of the other Romanov branches. (For more information on the Romanov split, read Robert Massie's The Romanovs: The Final Chapter.)<br />The Fate of the Romanovs is the clearest and most detailed summary of everything that is known about the deaths of the Romanovs now available. For that reason, and also because it clears away a lot of myths and legends that have grown up in the 85 years since Ekaterinburg, it belongs in the collection of every Russian and Romanov history student.tudent.	2003-09-28

If indeed that is what it was, the book would be a useful addition to the history of our era.  Unfortunately, it is nothing more than another dreary addition to the already lengthy list of books (and in speaking of publications of this nature one uses the term loosely) about President Clinton's perfidies and how they supposedly endangered the nation.<br />This book supposedly chronicles the many lost opportunities the US had to capture Bin Laden during the Clinton Administration.  Some of these are already well known and documented. President Clinton himself has expressed his frustration over several near misses.  However, most of the rest of what this book categorizes as failures are nothing more than the kind of hyperbolic innuendos and sometimes outright lies that one has come to expect from the anti-Clinton book industry.<br />The fabricated and exagerrated claims made by this book are less interesting than what it leaves out.  Nowhere is there a mention of the repeated attempts by the Clinton Administration to gain increased funding for anti-terrorism which were blocked by the Republican Congress. Most tellingly, there is not a word about the involvement of the Reagan and first Bush Administrations in Osama Bin Laden's rise to power and subsequent anti-American activities.<br />One should not be surprised by these omissions.  This book is not meant to be a history.  It is a political tract designed to obscure the failures of the present Administration by blaming its predecessor. W.'s blind partisans will appreciate the effort.  The rest of us will roll our eyes and move on.	2003-09-14

In their lifetimes these women were regarded as mere pawns on the European chessboard of alliances and power politics.  They were married off to men they scarcely knew and who in many cases were extremely unpleasant companions and expected to make the best of it.  Most of the time all we now know of these women are their names on various genealogical charts.  John Van Der Kiste has resurrected these royal ladies and given them new life.<br />Most of these women turn out to have had fairly sunny and mild dispositions.  They were rarely given much education and had few inner resources to fall back on when their lives and marriages soured, as they so often did. Nevertheless they seem to have borne their lot with dignity most of the time, and sometimes they were able to find consolation in religion or in extramarital affairs.  I felt the sorriest for Caroline Matilda, sister of George III and known as Denmark's &quot;Queen of Tears&quot; for the suffering she underwent at the hands of a schizophrenic husband.  I liked George II's consort Caroline of Anspach and Electress Sophia of Hanover (the progenitress of the family) the best for their sharp intelligence and senses of humor.<br />Because so many of these women have similar names it can be confusing separating the Sophia Dorotheas and the Sophia Charlottes from the Carolines and Louises, but the genealogical charts at the front help a lot. Also, I felt some of the women got short shrift and were barely mentioned at all.  Nevertheless, Van Der Kiste has turned out a very satisfying volume.	2003-09-11

I find this calendar especially appealing  because Nasmith has chosen to to portray some less familiar scenes, such as the passage of the Oathbreakers out of the Paths of the Dead (very ghostly) and the wretched, defeated Saruman and Wormtongue after the end of the War of the Ring.  The illustrations are in roughly chronological order, and each page also has a smaller picture of an earlier or alternate version of the main painting, which allows us some insights into Nasmith's creative processes.  This is a calendar which will delight all year long.	2003-08-24

In Turtledove's world, the Confederacy won the Civil War and things have been going downhill ever since. Now the Confederacy is in the grips of the fascist dictatorship of Jake Featherston and allied with similar right wing regimes in France, Britain, and Tsarist Russia.  The United States swings  between laissez faire and social democracy, depending on which political party is in power.  It has dominated North America since winning the Great War in 1917, but now its control over occupied Canada and the vanquished Confederates is under strain. With its main ally Imperial Germany dealing with the death of its long time leader Kaiser William II, this is not the best of times for the US.<br />This book brings this interwar trilogy to a close, and apparently is the starting point for yet another series dealing with World War II and the post-war world.  These books are fascinating because they provide a mirror image view of our own world, with familiar characters like Ronald Reagan showing up in new but recognizable roles. They also help us to recognize that no matter how badly things seem to be going for us in our world, it could be much, much worse!!!	2003-08-03

Because the target audience for this book and others similar to it regard Bill and Hillary Clinton as devil's spawn or worse, the author does not bother to document his accusations and assertions.  He knows his readers will rush to believe anything about the 42nd President and his First Lady so long as it is negative.  Literary style is not required, merely a plethora of exclamation points, bold faced statements, and simplistic language.  Follow these simple guidelines, and an aspiring anti-Clinton author can strike it rich.<br />Although this book purports to detail Senator Clinton's presidential hopes, a substantial portion recapitulates, in voyeuristic detail, the sexual peccadillos of her husband.  None of this is new, but those who salivated over every word of the Starr Report will undoubtedly be titillated once more.  Another major segment documents the Senator's supposed twenty year long lust for the Presidency.  Since I doubt the author has ever spoken more than a few words at most to the Senator, the source of his knowledge is mysterious.  (It is probably the same imaginative sources which allow so many to speak so authoritatively about the inner workings of the Clinton marriage.)<br />The author's primary case against the Senator boils down to this: she is excessively ambitious to be President.  Now I am reasonably certain that the same charge can be made against a substantial majority of the 100 Senators, 435 House members, 50 governors, and multitudes of state and local officials.  There will be few books written about their \\"schemes.\\"  The Senator is so favored because she, like her husband, is a perennial target of what she herself aptly calls \\"a vast right wing conspiracy,\\"  a group of powerful people who wish to preserve power for themselves and their political allies (however deficient) and weaken or destroy the progressive agenda they regard as inimicable to their own comforts.<br />If Senator Clinton does run for the Presidency someday her platform and campaign will merit close scrutiny, thoughtful criticism, and analysis just like all other serious candidates.  If the level of the criticism does not rise above the sensationalism and rumor-mongering the anti-Clinton conspiracy is so prone to indulge, and of which this book is so typical an example, the American people will justifiably ignore it and the right wingers will see that which they most fear, the inauguration of the second President Clinton.n or destroy the progressive agenda they regard as inimicable to their own comforts.<br />If Senator Clinton does run for the Presidency someday her platform and campaign will merit close scrutiny, thoughtful criticism, and analysis just like all other serious candidates.

This book states that most of Hollywood's celebrities are liberals.  Most of them would not argue the point.  A worthwhile examination of the &quot;Left Coast&quot; would ask first if the political philosophy of an actor really matters, and secondly (and more broadly) if Hollywood influences society or merely reflects it.  Such a book would be interesting and enlightening.  Tales from the Left Coast is neither.<br />Even if we ignore the simplistic writing and clumsy editing, the book is disappointing because it is merely a catalogue of positions and sillinesses taken by some celebrities.  The point of this escapes me.  I, and I suspect most Americans agree, am not particularly impressed by political statements, be they left or right, made by movie and television stars.  Most of them are reasonably attractive people with at least some talent, and if I am pleased with them I watch their movies and programs.  When I think about politics I read and study and make up my own mind.<br />Therefore I feel that Tales from the Left Coast deserves to be taken just as seriously, and has just as much point, as the latest political statement of the most recent mega star.	2003-07-27

It is partly a travel diary of the author's many trips to Iran and Central Asia over a period of some forty years.  The primary purpose of the book is to trace the legacy of the ancient Iranian religious leader Zarathustra or Zoroaster.  This legacy is indeed fascinating, since it has had a major influence on the development of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  Unfortunately Kriwaczek sometimes is more enthusiastic than thorough or organized, and the reader is forced to leap back and forth through time and space and can wind up a bit confused about which traditiona and which era is being discussed.  Also, Kriwaczek's use of modern slang expressions can sometimes distract.<br />I enjoyed this book, regardless of the problems I noted above.  I found the descriptions of modern day Shia Islam and its probable legacies from Zoroastrianism very illuminating, so that I have a better grasp of the differences between Sunni and Shia Islam. The descriptions of present day Iranians and their pre-Islamic religious traditions are also intriguing.  I wish that Kriwaczek had spent more time on Mithraism and the Cathars and Bogomils, but what he did include was fascinating, too.  That's the only real reservation I have about this book, it is simply too short to do justice to its subject.	2003-07-22

They are not.  Nor are sometimes hysterical overgeneralizations made more believable by constant repetition.<br />An air of righteous indignation permeates this slim volume that is strangely at odds with the shallowness of the accusations and assumptions it contains.  For example, Mr. Aldrich is outraged over a judge's ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional.  Does he explain why he feels the judge is incorrect?  Does he give dissenting opinions by other jurists? No, Mr. Aldrich merely asserts  that the judge must hate God. I do not know what circles Mr. Aldrich habitually moves in, but I hope that he  can explain himself in conversation more ably than he does in print.<br />Undoubtedly there is a need for examinations of how extremist elements on both the Left and the Right in this country have strained our body politic in recent years.  Mr. Aldrich's effort falls far short of what is required.	2003-07-20

As can be imagined, an awful lot of material has to be left out, and most of what was left out is the history of other areas of the world besides the West.  Fromkin takes a cheerful, optimistic view of human progress and development, and this is as it should be if you are looking at things from only a Western perspective.  However, if you really want a good brief look at how the world has developed, you need to look elsewhere, possibly to The Human Web, by William and Robert McNeill.

I'm especially impressed by his inclusion of the different algorithms used to calculate dates, of Easter for example, which are marvelously complex. Most readers will  never have occasion to use these algorithms, but its nice to know they're there.  I also appreciated the charts and the glossary of the more obscure calendrical terms.	2003-07-17

In Dereliction of Duty we have yet another chronicle of the Clinton Administration's supposed excesses, shortcomings, and treasonous activities.  One would suppose that the subject would be worn thin by this time, but the appetites and wallets of the Clinton-haters among us must be limitless, even for so slight a volume as this one.<br />The tone of the book is set by the cover photograph showing President Clinton with a golf tee in his mouth, apparently to suggest he fiddled while Rome burned. (As if Republican Presidents never play golf?) Inside the book the reader is regaled with episode after episode of supposed miscreances by President and Mrs. Clinton and other officials. These include another biased description of &quot;Chinagate,&quot; a non-scandal which has been investigated over and over again by some of the most rabid of the President's enemies, without result.  We also hear of such shocking crimes as Mrs Clinton's profanity (of course Republicans are never profane) and that she actually carried files with her on trips to Camp David. (How did she ever escape indictment on that one?) Also, President Clinton was sometimes too busy to see or phone people the author thought he should have!  We are left with the impression that the author is one of those happy people who have never encountered people with priorities different from his own. Most of the rest of us will shrug our shoulders in bemusement at his discomfiture.<br />The heart of this book deals with the ways in which the author feels that President Clinton endangered national security. Again, the author does not seem to understand that not everyone shares his viewpoints.  Certainly he is entitled to his opinion, and he is certainly entitled to criticize the President's actions, but to claim that those actions jeopardized the nation because they were not the actions the author himself would have taken is hubristic in the extreme.<br />If the contents I have described thus far were all that were in this book, I could dismiss it as quaint but amusing.  However, I find it disturbing, to say the least, that the author makes insulting statements about the great majority of US service men and women, for whom I, and most Americans, have enormous respect.  I do not for a moment believe the author when he implies that our military as a whole forgot that President Clinton was their commander in chief to whom they owed full allegiance, nor that they were willing to ignore the time honored tradition of civilian control of the military.  I am shocked that a military officer who rose to work in the White House would regard the actions of the few misguided officers and men who were less than respectful to President Clinton as symbolic of the attitude of the entire armed forces.  If there is any dereliction of duty detailed in this book, it lies with those who would foster the perception that our armed forces have been anything other than unswervingly loyal to any commander in chief, and they should be ashamed.this book, I could dismiss it as quaint but amusing.

Ann Coulter has become one of the lead dogs in the ever increasing pack of right wing hounds, baying their distorted world view and pouncing with slathering jaws on anyone they view as their enemy, which basically means anyone who doesn't share that world view.  This style of attack dog politics had its modern beginnings with the witch hunts of Senator Joe McCarthy in the early 1950s, so it's appropriate that Ms Coulter spends so much of her time defending Tailgunner Joe.<br />Beginning with the Cold War and running up to the present, Ms Coulter distorts history beyond recognition.  She conveniently forgets that liberals were the earliest advocates of a hard line policy towards Communism, while conservatives were demanding a return to isolationism.  She ignores the countless lives damaged by McCarthy's allegations and the strong leadership provided by liberals in the 1960s and 1970s as the Cold War continued.  In her haste to condemn those she obviously despises, she overlooks the strong support many liberals have given the Gulf War and the War on Terrorism.<br />I suspect that Ms Coulter, in common with her former friend and fellow attack dog David Brock, is primarily motivated by the desire to earn a dishonest buck or two.  Mr. Brock has grown weary of his career as a right wing hatchet man and written a confessional: Blinded by the Right.  I trust that someday a similar work will be forthcoming from Ms Coulter.  Until then, I can only paraphrase Robert Welch's famous rebuke to Joe McCarthy: \\"Have you no sense of decency, ma'am, at long last?\\"	2003-07-02

Anthony Everitt's biography of Marcus Tullius Cicero brings the world of the late Roman Republic to life in all its excess, wealth, violence, and glory.  The central figure is Cicero himself, who strove to maintain the traditional Roman governmental structure in the face of heavy opposition from both the populares or reformers and the optimates or conservatives. Everitt uses modern terminology to help us understand the issues and personalities and complexities of Cicero's life and times.  I recommend this book to Roman scholars and to general readers who, for example, enjoyed the &quot;I, Claudius&quot; miniseries on Masterpiece Theater in the 1970s or Steven Saylor's &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; mysteries (which feature Cicero as a major character).	2003-06-12

The fact that thousands of Tutsis were being hunted down and slaughtered by their Hutu neighbors didn't register with most of us until after the worst of the tragedy was over and the piles of bodies began to be buried. This willfull ignorance is ironic because, as Gourevitch makes clear, the massacre was a direct result of Western imperialist policies and interference in the indigenous tribal system of Rwanda.<br />The book is a quick read, not because the subject matter is easy to digest, but because it is so horrifying that it can't be put down or dismissed.  I hope this book helps to personalize the horror of Rwanda in 1994 in the same way Anne Frank's diary evokes the Holocaust.	2003-06-12

They have been characterized by a high degree of bigotry, hypocrisy, deceit, and in some cases raving paranoia.  Now in The Clinton Wars Sidney Blumenthal has rescued the record of the Clinton Administration from the slathering jaws of the Radical Right (which has now swallowed most of the Republican Party)and given us the true story of a President and his Administration which, while far from perfect, had the strange idea that they were elected to govern the country in the interests of all of its people, not just those of a supercilious elite.<br />Blumenthal concentrates on the second Clinton term.  He does not shy away from the Lewinsky scandal, but covers it fully and in the context of the numerous other investigations with which the President's enemies sought to destroy him.  Blumenthal rightly points out that the President was his own worst enemy when he lied about his affair in the first place.  This deception by a President who was undoubtedly one of the most talented men to hold the office still rankles with me and with many of his other supporters, and I hope that eventually Clinton will explain his actions more fully in his own memoirs.  However wrong Clinton was in seeking to conceal this affair, it does not excuse the overweening arrogance and smug hypocrisy with which Kenneth Starr and his henchmen in the Congress sought to make political hay out of a consensual affair between adults.  Blumenthal sets out the full story of the shameless impeachment proceedings and reminds us of just how imperfect these self appointed guardians of the public virtue were themselves.<br />Blumenthal ends his book with a description of what he aptly calls the last of the Clinton Wars, the oily machinations by which the Republicans seized control of the White House after the 2000 election.  This, above all other reasons, is why this book is so important.  It is a guide and a warning for all who oppose the extreme Radical Right agenda now being pursued by the Bush team.  Even if we succeed in throwing the Bushies out of Al Gore's house on January 20, 2005 we will still be locked in battle with a well funded and amoral foe.<br />The Clinton Wars will be a useful reference for years to come.or all who oppose the extreme Radical Right agenda now being pursued by the Bush team.

The events of September 11 itself are relegated to a prologue of two dozen pages or so.  The rest of the 700+ pages (including notes and index) are made up of descriptions of how America dealt with the changes brought about by the terrorist attacks.  This could be incredibly tedious in the wrong hands, but Brill is a master at capturing the humanity of his subjects, whom he follows in a diary like format for a full year. I especially enjoyed following the travails of Sal Iacono, whose shoe repair shop was devastated by the attacks but who was fortunate enough to find a dedicated pro bono lawyer who helped him get the grants and loans he needed to recover.  Brill's coverage of the difficulties faced by the families of three of those killed in the World Trade Center is sensitive but thorough. Some people and groups come off better than others.  Senator Chuck Schumer and Governor Tom Ridge both get high marks for their dedication to solving the myriad problems of the period.  Attorney General John Ashcroft appears as a man of limited intellectual curiosity determined to fight terrorism no matter how much he tramples on the Constitution. (The ACLU's leader makes an interesting counterfoil to Ashcroft.)  The Red Cross appears first as an organization too eager to collect funds and too reluctant to disperse them, then as being so reckless in spending that multiple abuses take place.<br />The book ends on a hopeful note in January of 2003, with the US now better prepared for future terrorist attacks and with its basic values intact.  After should be one of the books historians turn to in order to understand how we coped with the period after September 11.	2003-06-11

Now in Empire Ferguson has given us a history of the British Empire which any nineteenth century imperialist would pronounce to be pukka, or first rate.<br />Basically Ferguson argues that the British Empire was a positive contribution to the world in that it gave its colonial possessions traditions like self-government and personal liberties.  Ferguson does not maintain that there were no abuses of power or that none of the indigeneous peoples ruled by British officials were ever mistreated, but he does believe that on balance, more good was done than bad.  He makes this argument most strongly in covering the twentieth century, when he points out that the British were much better colonial rulers than the Germans or Japanese were.  Most of Empire's readers will undoubtedly agree with this point, but many will also wonder why it was necessary for the British to colonize these peoples in the first place.  Ferguson is straightforward, saying that the original reason for imperialism was greed for products like tea.  More highflown objectives like ending the slave trade and converting \\"primitive\\" areas to civilization and Christianity came much later,and never diverted attention for very long from the basic quest for wealth. Ferguson is also direct in saying that the major reason for the end of the Empire after World War II was that it was simply too expensive to keep going.  The last pages are especially timely in that Ferguson speculates on the role of a revived imperialism of the twenty-first century in the hands of Britain's most famous former colony, the United States.<br />One of Empire's major flaws is its tendency to give short shrift to the cultures which came under British power.  The Mughals of India are barely discussed, and Qing Dynasty China rates even less attention.  Ferguson's basic attitude is that those cultures were no better, and in some ways much worse, than the British who came to dominate them.  For another view of Britain's supposed superiority in governing Asian territories, you could read Mike Davis' Late Victorian Holocausts, which chronicles British ineptitude in dealing with famine in India and China.<br />The book is well written and beautifully illustrated.  I hope that the British TV series it companions will eventually be shown on PBS.  Like the book, it should be controversial and thought-provoking.e United States.<br />One of Empire's major flaws is its tendency to give short shrift to the cultures which came under British power.

Fagan does not blame every historical incident on the NAO, or North Atlantic Oscillation, but does make a good case that fluctuations in the NAO have intensified the effects of such disparate incidents as the Black Death epidemic, the Irish potato famine, the Great Fire of London, and many other events. Fagan also does a good job of pointing out that we are presently living in an apparent warm spell, intensified by the greenhouse effect, and helps us recognize the potential for sudden, perhaps catastrophic change in our weather systems.

Throughout the book the authors are often diverted into fascinating tangents which add light to either Servetus' life and work or to the circumstances under which the three copies survived.<br />Out of the Flames will not only inspire you with the story of Michael Servetus and his stubborn devotion to his heretical views, (and to his remarkable scientific and anatomical knowledge) but will also impress and intrigue with the amount of research the Goldstones did in order to track down the three copies.	2003-03-10

I know I certainly won't be buying a Shakespeare First Folio, but nevertheless I value Among the Gently Mad for the perspective it gives me on my fellow bibliophiles.  I enjoy reading about the book fairs and the lengths to which some collectors go to add to their libraries. Most of all I enjoy the tips Basbanes and his subjects give me about adding to my own collection.  An absolutely essential addition to any gentle mad person's library.	2003-03-10

Gavin Menzies, a throwback to the days of the Victorian amateur historian, has produced a massive work of speculation and imagination.  In brief, the former Royal Navy submarine commander believes that the Ming treasure ship voyages of the 1420s went much further than the African, Indian, and Middle Eastern ports they are supposed to have visited.  Menzies claims evidence that Admiral Zheng He and his fellow eunuch admirals explored most of the world, in the process creating maps that were the basis for the later explorations of Columbus, Da Gama, and other Europeans.<br />I enjoyed this book.  Menzies' enthusiasm is contagious, and I especially enjoyed his reminiscences of his own submarine visits to some of the ports he claims the Chinese visited.  But in the cold light of day, I have to say that his theory isn't supported.  Time after time he makes bold statements, then has to say that he was refused permission to make the final tests that would prove his ideas, or that the data wasn't ready in time for the hard cover edition, or that more information is to be published on his website.  Well, why didn't he delay the book a year or so in order to get the proof he claims he has included? Another problem I have is Menzies' claim that all of this Chinese exploration took place in just a few years time in the 1420s.  Frankly, I think his theory would be much stronger if he had claimed some sort of long term Chinese sea exploration project.  Finally, in all this travelling around that the treasure ships are supposed to have done, why didn't any visit Europe?  It seems awfully careless of Admiral Zheng He (who was a truly redoubtable fellow, read Louise Levathes' When China Ruled The Seas for more material on him)to have neglected to visit a continent with a significant number of literate, urbanized areas ripe for trade. (The Chinese knew where Europe was, they hade been in contact for fifteen hundred years or so.)<br />So, I have a very positive impression of Gavin Menzies and I appreciate his enthusiasm and his certainty, however I can only recommend 1421 as an engaging and entertaining work of speculation.br />So, I have a very positive impression of Gavin Menzies and I appreciate his enthusiasm and his certainty, however I can only recommend 1421 as an engaging and entertaining work of speculation.	2003-01-30

Xenia is less well known than her brothers Nicholas and Michael or her younger sister Olga, whose biography/memoir The Last Grand Duchess by Ian Vorres, was published in 1964 and recently republished in paperback.  Part of the reason for this is that Xenia was the \\"good girl\\" of the Romanov family.  She married young to her cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and raised a family that included one daughter and six rambunctious boys.  She was not a rebel like Olga or Michael, both of whom had very public marital difficulties and tended to be embarrassments to the Tsar before the Revolution.  Nor was she in the spotlight like the Tsar and his family, so that her life was exhaustively chronicled.  She and her husband Sandro married for love, later fell out of love and conducted discreet affairs with others, and in general lived quiet lives.  During the Revolution they escaped to their palace in the Crimea where they lived until rescued in 1919.  From then on Xenia lived quietly, mainly on the charity of her cousin King George V of England, until her death in 1960.  She seems primarily to be of interest because she was the Tsar's sister and the mother-in-law of Prince Felix Yussoupov, one of Rasputin's murderers.<br />This book tends to be a bit dull because there is very little first hand information that come directly from Xenia.  We never get the full names of her lover or lovers, for example.  Much of what we are told is extrapolated, for instance we are told that Xenia was shocked by Rasputin, but there seems to be no evidence that she ever met him!  (Olga's memories of Rasputin are among the most compelling sections of The Last Grand Duchess).  Because there seems to be so little real information about Xenia's own personality, the authors spend an inordinate amount of time on unnecessary details, like for example, who her visitors were on her birthdays and what they wrote to her in letters (Few of Xenia's own letters seem to have been located and used.)<br />So this is a fairly interesting book with some new details about Xenia's life and family, but by reading it you are not going to feel that you knew her or have any real sense of what she was like as a person.in letters (Few of Xenia's own letters seem to have been located and used.)<br />So this is a fairly interesting book with some new details about Xenia's life and family, but by reading it you are not going to feel that you knew her or have any real sense of what she was like as a person.	2003-01-12

King Leopold II of the Belgians enjoyed a reputation for humaneness due to his sponsorship of efforts to end the slave trade.  As Adam Hochschild makes clear, the King's efforts were calculated so as to obscure from the world what was really going on in the Congo.  Starting in 1885, Leopold's minions worked literally millions of people to death in the pursuit of profits in ivory and rubber. Brutality was commonplace and expected. There are horrific descriptions of attacks on villages, coldblooded mutilations, and other horrors.  Hochschild draws parallels between the Congo atrocities and the activities of concentration camp officials in World War II and in the Soviet Union.<br />This book is also an excellent reminder of what can be accomplished when decent people see injustice and vow to stop it. Starting with a few righteous souls outraged over what they saw happening, the movement to expose and end the Congo atrocities eventually spread to many countries and ultimately embarrassed the Belgian government into taking control over the colony away from the King.<br />The book is well written, and despite the horrors it details never descends into sensationalism. It deserves a place in the library of any one who wants to shine a spotlight on evil.	2003-01-10

It is roughly chronological in scope but has plenty of fascinating little chapters highlighting certain aspects of the city's life over the centuries, like its pollution problems or its cosmopolitan populace.  This discursiveness is an echo of one of my favorite aspects of London: the chance of wandering from one neighborhood (or chapter) to another totally different in atmosphere.  Although at my first reading I went straight through in a matter of a few days, I anticipate keeping this book at hand for some time so as to be able to pick it up at random for a few minutes' reading.

Cornwell did an amazing amount of research, including DNA analysis of stamps and envelope flaps, and comes up with compelling though circumstantial evidence that Sickert was the Ripper.<br />Sickert has been named before as a possible Ripper or as being involved in a cover up of the Ripper's identity, but Cornwell is the first to actually sew all the pieces together for a complete portrait.  Sickert was a tortured man, a psychopath warped by a malformed penis which was made even less functional by botched surgeries when he was a child. He delighted in inflicting pain and in hurting those whom he deemed his inferiors.  While there is no smoking gun, no confession or eyewitness account, Cornwell does pile up the evidence against Sickert so that it seems irrefutable. Along the way she also does a good job of convicting the London police of incompetence in mishandling evidence and failing to put the pieces together.  She also provides strong evidence that the Ripper had a much longer career and many more victims than those usually awarded him. Furthermore, Cornwell exonerates some of the other Ripper suspects like Montague John Druitt and the Duke of Clarence (second in line to the throne).  Even if she had not summed up the case against Sickert so well, this would be a worthwhile book just because it puts to rest the tired old rumors of a Royal and/or Masonic conspiracy behind the Ripper murders.<br />Finally, Cornwell convincingly recreates the sad, impoverished world inhabited by Sickert's victims.  London in the late nineteenth century was no place to be if you were poor or especially a poor woman.  One feels so much pity for all of these women, forced into prostitution and despised for it.	2002-11-30

Thus part of the book is a scientific study of ENSO, while the rest is a chronicle of the horrendous suffering in India, China, and Brazil.  Even if you are familiar with the typical nineteenth century European Social Darwinist free trader ideology, the callousness of the attitudes of British viceroys and plentipotentiaries towards the suffering Indian and Chinese peasants is breathtaking.  Similarly, the arrogant disregard of the sufferings of the Brazilians by their government is beyond belief.<br />In contrast with the insouciance of the Europeans when faced with disaster, Davis provides some fascinating information proving that earlier famines in India and China before imperialism weakened their societies were dealt with swiftly and humanely, with a fine regard for easing suffering and preserving human life.<br />The most important message of this book is that much of today's Third World is the direct result of natural disaster augmented by human indifference.	2002-11-17

Some parts of this book have strength and produce some interesting new information, but unfortunately the main premise of the book cannot hold water.<br />The first section deals with the complicated negotiations and intrigues that went on in 1917 and 1918 between Britain, Germany, the Russian Provisional Government, and later with the Bolsheviks over what was to happen to the deposed Tsar Nicholas II and his family.  McNeal has turned up some surprising material, such as that the British were apparently constructing a house for the Tsar in Murmansk where he could await a restoration, and invokes some well known names in the world of espionage like Sidney Reilly, the ace of spies.<br />Next McNeal covers some familiar ground as she recapitulates the inconsistencies and fabrications of the official Sokolov account of the death of the Imperial Family.  Very little of this is new, as numerous investigators over the last thirty years or so have poked holes in Sokolov's official line.  McNeal brings in a new twist as she points out a few discrepancies and misstatements that she feels point the way to the true story.  She also relies quite a bit on Rescuing the Czar, published in 1920 in the US.  Most researchers have dismissed this book as an imaginative but false account, but McNeal does a good job of pointing out that the book does seem to have some information that was apparently pretty close to the truth.<br />Toward the end of the book McNeal's story trails off a bit.  There is really no way to dispute the fact that bodies with mitochondrial DNA corresponding to that of the tsar and his family were discovered in a grave near Ekaterinburg in 1991, pretty much in the same area the accounts of the assassins had pinpointed all along. McNeal tries to dismiss the DNA research as inconclusive and hints it may even have been planted on the bodies.  Ths is simply ridiculous since there was no way whoever did the planting could have known the correct DNA haplotypes for both Nicholas and Alexandra.<br />McNeal has done an enormous amount of research, but unfortunately, knowing the serial codes for Colt revolvers used in the murders and getting the timetables for British gunboats on Chinese rivers doesn't make her hypothesis believable.  The biggest problem of all, of couse is if the Tsar and his family did escape, where did they eventually wind up?  McNeal trails off here, of course, because there is simply no gainsaying that Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children were murdered in July 1918 in Ekaterinburg.  The details were probably not exactly like the official story has always had it, but in the end the Romanovs wound up in that common grave in the forest.<br />That's really the saddest part of this book, that all those machinations and plots couldn't save the lives of a man who was a bad tsar but a good husband and father, his loving wife, their four beautiful daughters, and their ailing son.<br />If you would like more information on the end of the Romanovs, I'd suggest Robert K. Massie's The Romanovs:  The Final Chapter. For more information on mitochondrial DNA and its uses, read The Seven Daughters of Eve by Bryan Sykes.he bodies.

Supposedly Howard Carter found some papyri in the tomb shortly after its discovery.  These papyri supposedly contained new information on the early history of the Jewish people.  And supposedly this information would place in doubt the historic claim of the Jewish people to the land of Israel.<br />On one level this is a rather entertaining book because its an archaeological mystery story with sidelights into the occult. On a deeper level it doesn't really hold much water.  Regardless of the origin of the ancestors of the Jewish people (and this book has some intriguing material on that subject) nothing can deny that Jews did live in Israel/Judea for many hundreds of years.<br />Furthermore, thinking about those papyri, the authors can give very little real evidence that they ever really existed, or if they did,that they really contained the explosive material the authors maintain they did.<br />So, the book is well written, contains some interesting archaeological information on the early history of the Jews and their religious beliefs, and also provides some previously unknown (at least to me) insights into the occult beliefs of Lord Carnarvon and others involved in the tomb's discovery.  But as to how accurate it is, and how much stock to place in its theories, I'm much less willing to state an opinion.

Periodically he changes the proposed location of the civilization, originally thought to be Antarctica in Fingerprints of the Gods and now under the sea in Underworld.  Regardless of where Hancock thinks this civilization was to be found, he tells an entertaining story with much that bears thinking about.<br />All of Hancock's books are part history, part travel guide.  One of the more enjoyable aspects of Underworld are all the stories about his various travels and travails as he examines different areas of the world for evidence of ancient cities and buildings.  He is always eager and excited to find out more, and lets nothing, not even the ubiquitousness of bureaucracy ( his stories of the red tape involved in getting permission to dive in places like the Persian Gulf are worthy of the old Yes Minister show ) get him down.<br />Besides the travel stories, Hancock is worth reading because he has come up with an amazing amount of material which at least brings into question the accepted theories about the human past. I hope that his journalistic, rather than academic, credentials will not lead many to dismiss his theories, because they do deserve more study.	2002-11-06

It is the production of a professor and it bears many of the characteristics of such works:  huge numbers of footnotes, further Notes at the end (comprising about a third of the total book), and an extremely scholarly tone.  Fortunately Professor White writes much better than many academics, and the book contains a number of interesting speculations about the effect of Europe of the  technological changes which took place in the Middle Ages.<br />The book concentrates almost completely on Europe, so that you will have to look elsewhere for technological changes in the rest of the world, but what is here is fascinating. There is speculation on the role of the stirrup in revolutionizing warfare and feudalism, an examination of the effects of the three field system on the health of the medieval Europeans, and some intriquing hypotheses on the development of various power sources and machine designs.  Worthwhile, particularly in combination with a broader work such as Technology in World Civilization by Arnold Pacey.	2002-10-13

Filippo Brunelleschi, the architect, studied ancient Roman buildings like the Pantheon in order to understand how to construct the mammoth project.  Thus the story of the construction of the dome is a recapitulation of the story of the Renaissance itself, when Europeans sought to revive the ancient learning and skills of Rome and Greece.<br />The book is very short but filled with interesting information on the dome's construction and on building techniques in general.  It also provides a fascinating glimpse into Florence during the early Renaissance period, a time of great creative tumult and political turmoil.  Perhaps only Irving Stone's The Agony and the Ecstasy matches Brunelleschi's Dome for its evocation of the glorious Italian Renaissance.	2002-10-05

The author details the movement towards an English Bible and connects it to the wider story of the Protestant Reformation.  It turns out that the King James Bible was authorized out of political necessity.  The King was new on the throne and in the country and wanted to do something to solidify his support.  He also wanted to weaken the growing power of the Puritans, whose preferred translation, called the Geneva Bible, contained notes which were too anti-monarchy for the King's comfort.<br />There's a lot of fascinating information about the way the King James Bible reflected its own times (it was deliberately produced in language which was slightly old fashioned even in the 1600s) and the varying ways in which it has been received over the centuries. Its an excellent book whether you are interested in theology, language, or both.	2002-07-26

If anything, they know her as Prince Philip's mother.  And that's a pity, because Hugo Vicker's new biography reveals that Alice Battenberg was a truly remarkable individual.Alice was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, which must have seemed her only interesting point at the time of her birth.  Her father was morganatic (half-royal) and her mother a princess from a minor German state.  Her first years were spent among her multitudinous family (Vickers provides footnotes and trees to help sort everyone out), in the background and unnoticed.  Alice's marriage was hardly a glamorous match.  Prince Andrew was a younger son of the King of Greece and while charming, not all that interesting.  Alice lived quietly until the 1920s, when a revolution in Greece and her own personal troubles caused her a certain notoriety.  Vickers does a good job of covering Alice's physical and emotional ailments and is most successful in describing her growing religious faith.  In this Alice is similar to her two Russian Aunts, Tsarina Alexandra and Grand Duchess Elizabeth.  During World War II Alice protected a Jewish family at grave risk to herself, so that she was later declared Righteous Among the Gentiles by Israel.After World War II Alice continued to live in the background, now overshadowed by her only son, Prince Philip, who became the consort of Queen Elizabeth II.  She remained a loving and wise part of the Royal Family however, as memories of her from her grandchildren and other relations attest.Alice, Princess Andrew of Greece deserves a place in the library of anyone interested in royalty as well as anyone who cares to read about honorable and decent people.	2002-07-15

I think The Blood Doctor is the Vine work which is the widest and richest in scope since her first:  A Dark Adapted Eye.Martin Nanther is the 4th Lord Nanther, a man of great complexity.  As an hereditary peer, he enjoys his work in the House of Lords (and the income it provides), but he accepts that heredity is not a suitable prerequisite for a government position.  At home he has a beloved second wife who wants desperately to have children, a prospect that Nanther views with indifference or distaste (he already has an unsatisfactory son), but knows he will have to accept if he is to save his marriage. His greatest complexities are revealed when he begins to research the life of his ancestor, the first Lord Nanther.Henry Nanther was an eminent Victorian physician, specializing in blood diseases like hemophilia.  This earned him entree into the Household of Queen Victoria and eventual ennoblement.  The first Lord Nanther was as complex as his great-grandson, as Martin discovers when he begins his research.  Martin eventually uncovers layers of mysteries in his family tree that trace back to the first Lord's researches and manipulations.  As Martin contacts hitherto unknown relatives and pieces together the puzzle, he recognizes that his great-grandfather's obsession with  blood has marked his descendants for the next century.This book is fascinating on several levels.  Genealogists will enjoy the descriptions of family research (trees are thoughtfully provided for those who get lost in the entangled branches).  Those interested in nobility and royalty will delight in the details of the life of a member of the House of Lords and the insights into the lives of some of Queen Victoria's descendants.  And of course, as always with a Vine book, you'll be engrossed in a dramatic and detailed story with a satisfying ending.By the way, other books you might find of interest after reading The Blood Doctor include Queen Victoria's Gene by D.M. and W.T.W. Potts, Prince Leopold by Charlotte Zeepvat, and Ask Sir James by Michaela Reidtisfying ending.By the way, other books you might find of interest after reading The Blood Doctor include Queen Victoria's Gene by D.M. and W.T.W.

This volume covers most of the 1920s and the early 1930s.  The USA is a proud, confident nation, now ruling most of Canada (Quebec is a semi-independent satellite republic) and parts of the Confederacy.  President Upton Sinclair has successfully introduced democratic socialism, and the stock market is booming.  Then, shortly after the inauguration of Hosea Blackford, (husband of Flora Hamburger, one of the more appealing characters) world wide economic crisis brings on the Great Depression.  The US, with its economy sinking and struggling to defend itself after a Japanese surprise attack, returns to laissez-faire capitalism and begins to rearm.In the CSA bad keeps going to worse.  The South limps through the 1920s until the Great Depression deals it a body blow.  In such times the traditional political parties have no answers, and more and more Confederates turn to the charismatic Jake Featherston, who promises to rebuild the CSA, avenge its defeats, and punish the blacks who stabbed it in the back.  The book ends with a chilling inaugural parade as Featherston is sworn in in Richmond.I'm glad to see that Turtledove has let us know more about what's going on in the rest of his world.  Britain and France have strong Fascist/Featherston style movements.  Imperial Germany and the USA dominate the world, but are beginning to eye each other uneasily.  Japan has swallowed the former French and Dutch empires and is salivating over British and American possessions.There appear to be at least two more volumes to come in this series.  Many intriguing possibilities are hinted at.  Will the USA recover fromt he Depression and meet an emerging Confederate military threat? Will Flora Hamburger Blackford restart her political career and rise to the top? What will Featherston do to the blacks he so hates?  Will there be a realignment of alliances?  The stage is set for some fascinating twists and turns.alignment of alliances?  The stage is set for some fascinating twists and turns.	2002-07-14

Gately provides plenty of fascinating information about the importance of tobacco to the Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans in Europe and in North America and does so with a witty, light touch and an ear for a good story, such as how the Hottentots became monotesticular.<br />The first sections of the book deal with tobacco's spread from the Americas to the rest of the world and its impact on different societies.  Towards the end Gately primarily concentrates on tobacco's history in the US and Britain.  Gately is British and apparently doesn't have too firm a grasp on American history, because he makes some errors and oversimplifications from time to time that will jump out at US readers, but that's only a minor distraction.  While I could have wished for more discussion of the reasons for the  increasing number of smokers in Asia  and the Third World, I did enjoy Gately's comparisons of the anti-smoking campaigns in Britain and the US during the 1960s and the 1970s.  All in all an interesting look at a plant which shaped our society for both good and ill.	2002-05-22

The epidemic affected the American Revolution because colonial soldiers who had not been previously exposed to smallpox contracted it in huge numbers, particularly in the New England and Southern colonies where inoculation had not been a widespread practice.  As a result of the disease British troops, most of whom had already been through the disease or been inoculated for it, found another advantage over the Americans in the early stages of the war.  Fenn goes into somewhat harrowing detail as she describes the sufferings of those who contracted the disease and those who went through the inoculation process, which must have been almost as awful as the disease itself.<br />Although the British had an advantage over the colonial soldiers in that most of them were already immune to smallpox, the King's forces still suffered from the epidemic due to the inroads the disease made among the slaves who flocked to join the British armies, particularly in the Southern colonies.  In the African American population the smallpox germ found another previously unexposed host, and the results were once more incredibly deadly. Fenn documents several cases where the British and later the Americans themselves practiced a primitive type of biological war by releasing contagious people into unexposed populations and by allowing items used by sufferers to be distributed to healthy people<br />In the Native American territories west of the thirteen colonies smallpox also spread like wildfire.  Fenn does a good job of tracing possible routes the disease followed as it spread from settlement to settlement along trade routes and shipping lanes, decimating the Indians, who again had no previous exposure and thus no defenses.<br />Pox Americana is valuable because it reminds us of our vulnerability to diseases which spread silently from victim to victim, and helps us realize that one of the deadliest weapons of war is not man made (though it is often deliberately helped along its way)e deadliest weapons of war is not man made (though it is often deliberately helped along its way)	2002-05-09

Brock's description of his early life and his first political interests (liberal Democratic) is a lead up to a major epiphany:  While a student at Berkeley in the early 1980s he saw Jean Kirkpatrick being shouted down by a group of left wing thugs.  Justifiably outraged, Brock began to attack political correctness and other foolishnesses in a series of articles for the campus newspaper.  Through this exposure he came to the attention of the national right wing,  which adopted him and assisted his ideological move from liberalism through conservatism into the arms of the extreme right's lunatic fringe.  Brock joined this fringe just at the time it reached its loudest and most hysterical pitch during the early Clinton years, a period when the traditional four horsemen of the Radical Right, greed, sexism, racism, and bigotry were joined by a fifth, prurience.<br />The story Brock paints of those years when the Far Right launched an unprecedented assault on the legitimately elected government is shocking, especially when he details the campaign of rumor, innuendo, and lies these self-proclaimed guardians of the nation created.  For all the weaknesses and frailties of President and Mrs. Clinton (and I make no excuses for either of them), Anita Hill, Vincent Foster, and the other victims of the Right Wing in those years, surely no human beings ever deserved such hatred and vituperation.<br />Blinded by the Right is an important book for four reasons:<br />1. It confirms (as if we needed confirmation) the existence of the \\"vast right wing conspiracy.\\" Brock gives names, dates, places of documented contacts and collusions between individuals and groups who sought to unseat the President and force their extremist agenda on the nation.<br />2. It clearly delineates the differences between today's right wing and the honorable, decent conservatism of the past.  While reading this book one is often moved to mourn the passing of the Goldwaters and Tafts and to muse over the probable reaction of Edmund Burke to today's so called conservatives:  would he not rush to scrape them off his shoes?<br />3. It reveals the hypocrisy of those right wing spokesmen and women who condemned President Clinton's moral failures while maintaining their own cozy little m&eacute;nages and other dubious liaisons.<br />4. It depicts in detail the petty meanness and nastiness of the so-called humor of the right wing, which came to dominate the airwaves during the 1990s.  Stories and jokes which would be too vulgar for a boys junior high school locker room are banded about freely amongst these self-described ladies and gentlemen.  I would use the term \\"sophomoric\\" but I teach high school sophomores and few of them would stoop to repeat some of that stuff.<br />To his credit, Brock details his own part in these savageries without excuses beyond pecuniary ones (he evidently did quite well financially out of it all).  And he points out with regret the damage that was done to our nation's political process and to the public's perception of that process.  This is indeed damage that will take a long time to mend.  I trust that eventually Brock's former associates will join him in regretting what they have done.to mourn the passing of the Goldwaters and Tafts and to muse over the probable reaction of Edmund Burke to today's so called conservatives:  would he not rush to scrape them off his shoes?<BR>3.

Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra. Like Massie's work, this biography by Coryne Hall does more than just cover the life of its subject, it successfully evokes the last sixty years or so of the Romanov Dynasty, Russia, and Europe.<br />Dowager Empress Marie Fedorovna was born into an obscure branch of the Danish Royal Family with little money and fewer prospects.  Her rise to fame and fortune began when her father was adopted as the heir to the Danish throne, making her and her siblings acceptable spouses for the royal houses of Europe.  Marie (or Dagmar, as she was originally named) had one sister who married the Prince of Wales, a brother who became King of Greece,and another who became King of Denmark.  Dagmar herself was picked to be the wife of the Tsar of Russia's heir.<br />Dagmar/Marie seems to have sincerely loved her fiancee, Tsarevich Nicholas, and she was devastated when he died a few months after their engagement.  Nevertheless she was able to accept and eventually love Nicholas's younger brother Alexander, and together they produced what seems to have been an unusually happy royal family of five children.  Marie became Empress of Russia under the horrifying circumstances of the assassination of her father-in-law, and the reign of her husband Tsar Alexander III was tense and reactionary.  Marie seems to have been utterly loyal and loving, and although Hall tries to paint her as a secret liberal, no evidence is given that she ever tried to moderate any of her husband's policies.<br />When Alexander III died in 1894 Marie's oldest son became Tsar Nicholas II.  Here we see Marie's less admirable side as her cold treatment of her daughter-in-law Alexandra cut the ground from under the new Empress almost as soon as she arrived in Russia.  Hall cannot offer an explanation for the two womens' lack of sympathy beyond saying that they were simply too different. As the book goes on, this lack of sympathy becomes even more tragic, as Alexandra came under the thrall of Rasputin and Nicholas's fatalism caused him to take less and less action as Russia weakened and collapsed.  One senses that the Tsar and Empress could have used a dollop of good Danish common sense every now and then!<br />The last part of the book is the most heroic.  Marie stuck it out in Russia, to her own considerable endangerment, until late in the Revolution and only consented to leave if her companions were also allowed to do so.  During her last few years she stubbornly maintained as much grandeur as possible (to the considerable aggravation of her relatives who paid her bills) and died in her native country in 1928.  She is buried in the Danish Royal Family's crypt.  I hope that eventually her last wish, that she be reburied beside her husband in St. Petersburg, can be realized.  It would be a fitting final tribute.es on, this lack of sympathy becomes even more tragic, as Alexandra came under the thrall of Rasputin and Nicholas's fatalism caused him to take less and less action as Russia weakened and collapsed.

Some of the pictures are very familiar to any royal aficionado, but most are fairly new and show a lot of the less prominent members of the family, like the descendants of Leopold Duke of Albany, who tend to get the short end of the stick from other royal chroniclers.  Its nice to browse through and because its arranged chronologically, the inherited family characteristics like weak chins and prominent eyes really jump out.  It must have been difficult to tell the Waleses from the Edinburghs and the Glucksburgs from the Bernadottes at times! Its also interesting to see childhood pictures of some of today's royals.  There's one picture of Prince Philip, for example, that looks just like his son Prince Edward at about the same age.  Finally, this is a nice book because it helps us realize that the European royals were and are just one big extended family with multitudinous branches.	2002-03-26

It is the story of the Zimmermann Telegram, a message sent by the German Foreign Minister to the Mexican Government in early 1917.  In essence the Telegram was an attempt to make Mexico a German ally in the event of the US entering World War I on the Allied side, with the bait being the possibility of Mexico reclaiming the states of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. When British Intelligence intercepted and decoded the Telegram they made certain that the US government and public heard about it quickly in the hopes of bringing the US into the war.<br />The book is more than just the story of the Telegram itself.  It includes a run through of the various German espionage efforts in the US before and during World War I and a good description of the unease felt by the US at the mysterious German machinations, including possibly collusion with Japan and an attempt to take control of the Panama Canal.<br />Like all of Tuchman's works, The Zimmermann Telegram is scholarly without being dull, and a real delight.	2002-03-26

This is a thorough and interesting study of how humans have changed or damaged their natural surroundings from the earliest hunter-gatherer days through the modern post-Industrial world.  It seems that any modification of the environment has unintended and unexpected consequences down the road.  Of course in the past few had the time or the vision to anticipate these consequences, and we are now living with the results of centuries of pollution, salinization, and general degradation. This is not a polemic but a well-argued study which asks us to consider whether our effect on the natural world has been more for good or ill.  It is a good precursor to ideas later developed further in Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, among others.	2002-03-19

The editors had no idea for many years of the nature of one of their best contributors, and Winchester's description of their reactions, and of the meeting between the Professor (chief editor) and the madman who became friends in collaboration, is heartwarming.

She has a strong sense of morality and justice and a great love for her characters.  The Whitechapel Conspiracy is somewhat of a departure for her in that she has chosen to rehash the Jack the Ripper legend.  Her apparent source is The Ripper and the Royals, which when published in the early 1990s claimed to have proof that the Ripper crimes were connected to the secret marriage and fatherdom of Albert Victor (Eddy), Duke of Clarence and Avondale, second in line to his grandmother Queen Victoria's throne. This is an old rumor which never seems to die out, but instead, like the Kennedy assassination theories, just keeps rolling along, adding ever more outlandish embroiderings with each new version.<br />Regardless of the reliability (or lack thereof) of her source, Perry has turned out yet another good chapter in the lives of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, whom I have followed with great delight for more than ten years now. Although I am disappointed that her subject matter is not new, I still enjoyed The Whitechapel Conspiracy, and await her next effort with pleasure.	2002-03-19

The Map That Changed the World is the story of William Smith, a self taught and brilliant geologist who created the first geological map of England and Wales.<br />This book is a delight for several reasons.  First, it successfully evokes the atmosphere of the late eighteenth century to early nineteenth century, an exciting period when scientific inquiry was beginning to challenge old certainties.  William Smith did not just develop a new way to depict the earth's surface, he was developing a new theory about the earth's history and thereby challenging religious orthodoxy.  Secondly, this book works because William Smith himself was such a pleasant, unpretentious fellow.  His singleminded devotion to geology brought him into contact with many British aristocrats, whom he seems to have treated in the same down to earth style he used for everyone.  This, along with some disastrous financial and marital decisions,led to Smith's impoverishment and imprisonment for debt and (probably worst of all to him) his blacklisting from membership in the elite Geographical Society.  It is good to know at the end of the book that Smith overcame these setbacks and by the end of his life was receiving the honor and acclaim he deserved.  The third reason to buy this book is Simon Winchester's writing itself.  As in everything he produces, Winchester sparkles and charms.  So buy the book, along with anything else by Winchester you can find.	2002-03-04

To me that meant he was a dilletante not worth my time.  Then during the trial I came to enjoy his analyses on various news programs, but I still shied away from reading his Vanity Fair articles.<br />Therefore when I picked up Justice it was mainly to review his take on the OJ mess. I was immediately taken aback by the first article, which is the story of the murder of Dunne's own daughter, the trial of her murderer, and the pain Dunne still feels years later.  Clearly, there is more to this man than I thought.  This was borne out by other sections of Justice which deal with other famous trials Dunne has observed: Von Bulow, Menendez, etc.  All of them are well written and provide a troubling vision of how American justice doesn't seem to work well much of the time.<br />I don't mean that Dunne is always deep and weighty.

His theory, which makes a lot of sense, is that these so called supernatural beings were humans from a distant and more advanced civilization who visited the Middle East and introduced new ideas and technologies to the local inhabitants.  He doesn't quite nail down where this civilization might have been located,and unfortunately goes off on a tangent to Egypt for some unnecessary speculations on the origin of the Pyramids, etc. But even so his theory holds water and deserves further consideration.	2002-02-20

It is the autobiography of Jessica Mitford Treuhaft from her birth in 1917 up to the death of her first husband in 1941.  Jessica Mitford was the next to youngest of the fabulous Mitford sisters, daughters of Lord and Lady Redesdale and surely among the most original scions of nobility to ever grace the pages of Burke's Peerage.  Jessica is hilarious as she describes her eccentric childhood with Farve and Muv and her siblings Nancy, Diana, Tom, Pam, Unity and Deborah.  The tone becomes somewhat (but only somewhat) more serious as she gets into the 1930s, when her sisters Diana and Unity became entranced with Hitler and Fascism and she herself became a committed Communist.  Despising the world of the debutantes her parents expected her to enter, Jessica ran away from home to join her cousin and future husband Esmond Romilly in the Spanish Civil War.<br />After their sensational elopement and marriage Jessica and Esmond lived for a time in the East End of London, then traveled to the US as World War II was about to break out.  There Esmond joined the Canadian Air Force and was lost in the North Sea in December, 1941.<br />Jessica Mitford had a marvelously witty pen, and there's at least one snicker on every page of Hons and Rebels.  She was not above embroidering the truth to make the story better, so if you want to get the whole story you will want to check other Mitford histories like Mary Lovell's recent family biography, The Sisters. About twenty years after publishing Hons and Rebels Jessica published a second volume of her autobiography:  A Fine Old Conflict, which describes her and second husband's troubles during the McCarthy era in the US.  I hope that it will also be republished as it is just as entertaining as Hons and Rebels.	2002-02-20

Its quite intriguing because it reveals that most of what we have traditionally considered the true history of the region, as revealed in the Old Testament, is inaccurate.  Among the revelations:  the Exodus from Egypt did not take place under Ramses II, or indeed at any other time so far as the historical record shows; the unified kingdom of David and Solomon never existed; and the monotheistic Hebrew religion developed slowly over a period of centuries.<br />Apparently, much of the Biblical history we accepted for years was written during the reign of King Josiah of Judah in an effort to unify and inspire the Hebrews as they faced overwhelming enemies.  Should this destroy anyone's religious faith?  Not according to the authors, who rightfully point out that the essential teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not depend on whether every single word in every single book of the Old Testament is absolutely accurate.  Instead, read and enjoy this book in the recognition that the Bible's greater truths are as inspirational as they ever were.	2002-02-20

Once again Fanny Logan is the narrator, but this time the action is set in Paris, where Fanny's husband has been appointed the British Ambassador.  Fanny has to deal with the problem of the preceding Ambassadress still being in residence and refusing to leave, then with the multiple problems that come with being related to the Radletts, who are made out to be the battiest aristocrats in Britain.<br />Don't Tell Alfred was written in the late 1950s while Nancy Mitford was living in Paris.  A lot of the political inside jokes will fly right over the heads of most readers today, and Mitford's attempts to depict Teddy Boys and rock and roll bands must have seemed unintentionally comic even then.<br />Even though this is not one of Mitford's best works, it does have her sharp wit and felicitous turns of phrase, and for those alone the book is well worth the reading.	2002-02-08

Mitford was the eldest daughter of Lord and Lady Redesdale, British aristocrats whose ancestry stretched to the Middle Ages and beyond and whose relatives included Winston Churchill.  Mitford began writing in the early 1930s, but her early works are, while amusing, trivial and dated.  The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate were produced in the late 1940s, after Mitford had made a loveless marriage and begun a long, frustrating love affair with a Frenchman.  These adversities sharpened her insights and her pen, so that the two novels are as pleasing today as when they were first published.<br />The Pursuit of Love introduces us to the Radlett family, the children of Lord and Lady Alconleigh (thinly disguised and exaggerated versions of Lord and Lady Redesdale). The heroine is Linda, a romantic and lovely girl who dreams of perfect love.  She marries a dull young man, leaves him for a handsome zealot who has no time for her, and finally finds love (and tragedy) with an urbane Frenchman.  This is obviously a semi-autobiographical sketch of Nancy Mitford's own early years.  The other Radletts are composites and exagerrations of Nancy's own sisters and friends.<br />Love in a Cold Climate focuses on the viccisitudes of Polly Hampton, a neighbor of the Alconleighs who has similar troubles in love.  It features a couple of obviously gay characters (which must have been pretty controversial in the 1940s)and continue's Mitford's theme of the search for love.<br />Both novels are narrated by the Radlett's cousin Fanny Logan, whose own placid life and happy marriage make nice contrasts to all the troubles she sees going on around her.  The writing is sparkling and bright but not shallow, and while both novels have somewhat sad endings (Pursuit more so than Cold Climate), you will enjoy and want to reread them many times.	2002-02-08

This book is a fascinating look at as many global events as the author could clearly identify as happening in 1688.  The most eye-opening result, for me, is the recognition that our present inter-connected world was already taking shape 300 years ago.

The seven children of the second Lord Redesdale were raised in a fairly conventional upper class British manner, with servants and governesses.  As five of the six daughters emerged into adulthood, she found quickly found fame (or notoriety).  Nancy became a gifted novelist, essayist, and biographer; Diana started as a society hostess and ended as wife of one of the most controversial men in British politics and as an undaunted Hitler apologist; Unity went even further by becoming a Hitler acolyte who shot herself when World War II broke out; Jessica (Decca)also entered politics by becoming a passionate Communist and later a gifted social critic and muckraker; Deborah (Debo) was slightly more traditional in that she became a Duchess and chatelaine of one of England's grandest country houses.  Only the second daugher Pam lived a retiring life, and the only son Tom's career was cut short by his death in World War II.<br />The Sisters is a good introduction to the Mitfords if you aren't familiar with them.  Even if you are a long time Mitford aficionado it's a valuable read because it covers all the sisters without favoring or slighting any. This balanced look at the Mitfords will stand out because so much of what has been written about them is biased towards/against one or more of the sisters.  Mary Lovell spent a lot of time untangling the real family history, which is important because so much of the sisters' stories has gotten entangled with Nancy's fictional Radletts (from \\"The Pursuit of Love\\" and \\"Love in a Cold Climate\\") and with Jessica's imaginative memoir \\"Hons and Rebels\\".<br />By the time you finish the book you will be quite fond of all of the sisters and their extended family, and thanks to Ms. Lovell's inclusion of information on their descendants, you will feel like a friend who has known the family for two or three generations.erations.	2002-02-07

Ornamentalism covers the British attitudes towards their Empire during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<br />Cannadine argues that the British took a hierarchical view of their empire, ruling it on the basis of what they supposed to be traditional English government, which devolved from the monarch to the local nobility and gentry.  In the empire colonial governments made use of local grandees, such as the numerous Indian princes, so that Britain ruled not so much over them as through them.  Thus Cannadine disagrees with prevailing historical opinion, that the Empire was based on race, by demonstrating its basis in existing class structure<br />As always, Cannadine writes clearly with few wasted words.  He continues to be a master of the short biographical/historical sketch.  A short but fascinating read.	2002-01-22

Johnson first comes off as gruff and forbidding, but as we read on we realize the charm that, along with his celebrated erudition, made him a magnet for his many friends.  As for Boswell, was there ever a man so self-destructive yet accomplished?  Unwilling to settle down to follow in his father's footsteps as a lawyer and landowner in Scotland, he tore off to London whenever possible to enjoy the high life.  In the capital he tried to shine in high society, but usually wound up on its fringes at best.  Although he apparently adored his terminally ill wife, he was unable to resist prostitutes ( I lost count of the number of VD infections he contracted ).  He tried to go into Parliament, but failed to grasp that no one would be willing to sponsor him in a seat unless he agreed to give up his independence. (And we think politics today is cynical!)<br />Despite his naivete, Boswell was accomplished enough to turn out a landmark biography of Samuel Johnson.  Its emphasis on its subject's character has influenced every biography since.<br />Boswell's Presumptuous Task is an enjoyable description both of the process of writing a classic biography and of the growth of the biographer himself.	2002-01-22

Although she has left her native Great Britain for France in this life of Marie Antoinette, the result is a work that brings France's last Queen to life as vividly as any of her earlier efforts.<br />Marie Antoinette was one of the younger children of Empress Maria Theresa, who used her off spring as bargaining chips to improve the Hapsburg Dynasty's position in Europe.  Antoine, as she was known, was unfortunate enough to be the right age to marry the heir to the French throne.  Fraser spends a lot of time discussing the cold blooded negotiations that preceded 14 year old Antoine's being shipped off to France to marry the 15 year old Dauphin.<br />Not surprisingly, this marriage of children was unfruitful for several years.  In reaction to this and to the iron clad etiquette of the court at Versailles, Marie Antoinette ( as she was now known) led a frivolous life of partying, gambling, and spending.  Fraser does a good job in pointing out that Marie's spending habits were only a drop in the bucket of France's mounting economic crisis in the 1770s and 1780s, but her extreme visibility made her an easy target for the rising public anger against the monarchy.  Fraser also does a good job of documenting the love affair Marie had with Count Axel Fersen as well as the infamous Diamond Necklace Affair, which ruined her reputation once and for all.<br />After Louis XVI matured enough to father four children on Marie, the Queen settled down to a calmer, quieter life, but the damage was done.  She had become the symbol of everything that was wrong with the Old Regime, and after 1789 she and her family slid to destruction.  Fraser does an admirable job on the last harrowing years of the Queen's life, helping us recognize the dignity and courage displayed by the Royal Family in their darkest hour.<br />Fraser concentrated primarily on Marie Antoinette's personal life.  The events of Louis XVI's reign and of the Revolution are seen only as they directly affected the Queen.  Throughout the book Fraser writes clearly and with a felicitous turn of phrase:  the fishwives who harassed the Queen at Versailles were &quot;mouthy battleaxes.&quot;  Some of Fraser's wittiest comments are in the footnotes, including a delicious speculation on Benjamin Franklin's connection to the conception of the Queen's first child!

It is another great compilation of stories about book collectors, but it goes further by describing great libraries of the past, such as  Alexandria, Pergamum, and St. Gall; and of the present, including a fascinating comparison of the new British Library in London and France's Bibliotheque National.  There are also some nice portraits of great bookstores like New York's Strand and of some of the intrepid dealers who maintain the antiquarian book trade.<br />Perhaps the most important part of Patience and Fortitude is the section dealing with the dilemma faced by many libraries:  how to adequately store their collections, identify and weed out books which are no longer of use or value, and also provide public access to high technology.  Basbanes tells the sad story of San Francisco's library, which has less shelf room than the building it replaced, and contrasts it with Boston and New York's public libraries, which despite age and crowding still maintain excellent inventories; and with Harvard, which never discards books but must periodically send part of its vast collections to storage.<br />Patience and Fortitude is a wonderful book for anyone who still loves books.

The long delay was fortuitous, because its publication in the fall of 2001 serves to remind Americans that our country has been under terrorist attack before, and we survived and excelled.<br />Theodore Roosevelt came into office in September 1901 after an anarchist assassinated President William McKinley.  The atmosphere of fear and alarm that swept the country then bears a sharp resemblance to our national mood since September 11.  Fortunately, the events of September 1901 brought into office one of our most intellectually able and energetic chief executives.  The next seven and a half years were among the most dynamic in our history.<br />Theodore Roosevelt was a primal force.  Nothing like him has held power in Washington before or since.  His energy was boundless, his enthusiasm contagious, his charisma eternal. He seized control of the national agenda and forced the United States into the twentieth century.<br />After such a stupendous job of chronicling one of the most stupendous Presidents, I wonder how Morris will manage the third volume's inevitable tale of decline.  Given his track record, I'm sure it will be well worth the wait.  (I just hope it isn't another twenty years!)	2001-12-06

How could a work of such majesty ever translate to film?  Would it not inevitably be a shallow and weak travesty?  Brian Sibley's Official Movie Guide will go a long way towards setting such fears at rest.<br />My first emotion as I read the Guide was relief that so much care had been taken by the designers and director.  Hobbiton was built a year before it was needed in order to let the paths and plants settle in for a more natural look.  Copies of the books were read to pieces as each scene was planned, and Tolkien's own words were used in many cases.<br />Secondly, I was happy to see that the actors were mostly long time Tolkien fans themselves.  These are people who love The Lord of the Rings almost as much as I do, apparently.  They care about their characters and the story.  Their pictures and interviews reassure me that this is not just another part in another film, but something which demands their best work.<br />While I will still watch the film with some concern that some of Tolkien's magic will be missing, at least this book lets me know that Peter Jackson and his cast and crew have done their utmost to catch it all.	2001-11-28

(It was originally published in the mid 1960s).  This is the memoir/biography of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, youngest daughter of Tsar Alexander III and sister of Tsar Nicholas II.  She lived through and witnessed a tumultuous era in Russian and world history, having been born in 1882 and living until 1960.  She was born to enormous wealth in a palace and died in poverty in an apartment above a barber shop.  In her final years in Canada Grand Duchess Olga became friends with the author, Ian Vorres, and agreed to allow him to publish her reminiscences.  Vorres did an excellent job of preserving the Grand Duchess's voice and opinions while grounding them in as much historical research as possible.<br />Olga Alexandrovna was not a brilliant or well educated woman.  Her voice is that of a woman caught on the wrong side of history who suffered much tragic loss.  She is understandably sympathetic to Imperial Russia and blind to its shortcomings.  Nevertheless, the reader will find little bitterness in her story.<br />Olga was an individualist who enjoyed painting and a quiet country life.  She endured nearly twenty years of a mockery of a marriage her mother forced her into, then found happiness as the wife of an ordinary Russian officer.  Her second marriage caused her to become something of an outcast among her fellow Romanovs in exile, but she willingly gave up their society for the life of a simple country wife and mother, first in Denmark and later in Canada.<br />The most valuable parts of the book today are Olga's memories of her brother Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their five children.  Her descriptions of their loving home and family and of her brother and sister-in-law's many kindnesses are a welcome contrast to the many books which depict the last Tsar and Empress as cold and heartless.  Even more important are Olga's memories of Rasputin.  She must have been among the last people to clearly remember him, and her description of him is vivid and disturbing.<br />This is an excellent book for any student of Russia and the Romanovs.learly remember him, and her description of him is vivid and disturbing.<br />This is an excellent book for any student of Russia and the Romanovs.	2001-10-26

China's navy was then the most powerful in the world, and Levathes helps us recognize this with some skillfully drawn comparisons between Zheng Ho's treasure ships (the largest wooden vessels ever built) and the puny Santa Maria.  China was unquestionably the most advanced civilization in the world during Zheng Ho's time, and had the voyages been allowed to continue, resulting in permanent Chinese influence on and control of the Indian Ocean, Africa, and possibly America and Europe, our world today would be very different indeed. Levathes does a good job of explaining why Ming China decided to stop the voyages and its international trade, and points out that while Westerners tend to see this as a failure, to the Chinese at the time it seemed a success.  This is probably the most valuable insight of the book, the illustration of a very wide gap between the psychological makeup of East and West.	2001-10-17

Royal Subjects is a description in diary form of twenty years or so of contacts with British Royals both well known (The Queen Mother, Prince Charles) and almost unknown (Colonel Sir Henry and the Lady May Abel Smith).  Aronson clearly enjoyed meeting these people and likes most of them quite a bit, but he is not blind to their character flaws and is on the whole refreshingly unidolatrous. (Not to say he isn't loyal, as he obviously has little truck with republican sentiment)<br />Royal Subjects will appeal to you even if you are not a royal aficionado because Aronson very humorously describes the day to day sillinesses he puts up, from inane phone calls and letters to being interviewed by people who have obviously not read his books.  Most appealingly of all, Aronson never takes himself or his subjects too seriously, even when he has to deal with prostate cancer.

What If? 2 is even better than its predecessor because it does not stick to military issues, but examines a wide range of cultural and biological possibilities.  For example, the most intriguing chapter is a look at what would have happened had Jesus not been crucified, but lived to an advanced age. The postulated result is a true Judeo-Christianity imposed on the world by an apparently permanent Roman Empire.  Another remarkable chapter describes the probable impact of a Ming Chinese trans-Pacific voyage of discovery in the 15th century.  Military affairs are not entirely neglected, as there are discussions of alternate endings for the Battle of Hastings, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, among others.  Finally, there is a fine examination of the role of the potato in history.  I hope there is a What If? 3, 4, etc.	2001-10-15

Erickson shows Alexandra to have been an intelligent, complex woman who enjoyed reading philosophy, who had a sometimes cruel sense of humor (she drew nasty caricatures of her husband and members of the court), and who could be decisive and determined when her husband was passive and fatalistic.  Alexandra's maternal qualities are also emphasized, including her insistence on breast feeding her children and on personally nursing them through their illnesses. Other biographers have discussed this last point, but usually only in connection with her son's hemophilia.  Now we know that the Empress also sat up all night with her daughters.  Erickson does a good job of describing Alexandra's own ailments, including several miscarriages (which have never been discussed by other biographers), a false pregnancy, and what appears to have been an extended depression.<br />I would give this book five stars, but I am troubled by some of Erickson's sources and her lack of documentation.  She seems to have relied on the memoirs of one maid for most of her information on Alexandra's early married years and ignored (or at least not cited) much of the other material used by other authors which deal with that period.  Furthermore, Erickson states that Alexis had a hernia operation in 1912, with her source apparently being the highly doubtful memoirs of Rasputin's daughter.  I'm no doctor, but I wonder how anyone would dare operate on any hemophiliac in 1912, let alone the only son of the Tsar.  I've read quite a few Romanov books and I've never heard of such an operation before.  It also bothers me that very little attention is paid to Alexandra's deep religious beliefs, which caused her to believe in Rasputin's healing powers to the very end.<br />Even though I have these concerns, I still enjoyed Alexandra: The Last Tsarina very much, especially Erickson's insights into the Empress's inner emotions and the way she misunderstood and was misunderstood by Russian society.a few Romanov books and I've never heard of such an operation before.

It is a relief to this Tolkien fan to see that the film's makers have been so careful to get just the right &quot;feel&quot; for the landscapes and the characters.

The writing is not scintillating, and there are some ridiculous errors (The Tsar-Liberator was Alexander II, not Nicholas II). The editing leaves a lot to be desired, too, as there are some sentences which don't make sense unless you figure out that there are some words missing here and there.<br />Be that as it may, the book is nevertheless well worth your time. MacDonogh takes a different attitude than most about the Kaiser's damaged arm, pointing out that he was able to cope successfully with the handicap throughout a long life and that it was not necessarily psychologically damaging. MacDonogh also takes another view of Wilhelm's parents, Kaiser Frederick III and Victoria, Princess Royal of Britain. Most of their previous biographers have made &quot;Fritz&quot; and &quot;Vicky&quot; out as heroes determined to make Germany a liberal, democratic nation. MacDonogh underscores Fritz's weaknesses and penchant for pomp and Vicky's cold and demanding nature.<br />MacDonogh also illuminates Wilhelm's role as a surprisingly progressive ruler. The Kaiser was one of the first to speak of a United States of Europe and the need to let down customs barriers, eighty years before such ideas became fashionable. At the same time Wilhelm was advocating these reforms, unfortunately, he was also pushing Germany's imperialistic and militaristic policies until they became an open challenge to Great Britain and led to World War I.<br />One of the most interesting parts of the book is the section dealing with Wilhelm's exile in Doorn, Holland. It seems the ex-Kaiser may have grown up a little once he was out of the spotlight, refusing to deal with the Nazis, for example, and reducing some of his braggadocio.<br />So, despite the shortcomings of the writing and editorial processes, this is a worthwhile addition to your library.	2001-09-13

The difference between this one and his earlier work on the Von Bulow case (for example) is that the case is one which has had a disastrous impact on us all: Bush vs Gore, in which the Supreme Court surrendered to partisanship and denied the right of the people to be heard.  By halting the recount of the Florida votes in December 2000 the Court made Mr. Bush President.  But as Dershowitz convincingly demonstrates, the five to four decision can never give the Texan credibility or legitimacy.<br />Some Bush partisans have claimed that recent recounts have shown that Bush did carry Florida after all.  The recounts show no such thing at all, and recent revelations that many invalid absentee ballots were counted in Republican leaning counties merely muddy the waters further.  But even if Mr. Bush did manage to carry the state, it still doesn't alter the fact that the Supreme Court refused to allow the voters in Florida, and by extension, all voters throughout the country, to have their voice heard.<br />I am looking forward to the retirements of the fatal five injustices, and the confirmation battles which will ensue.

I had to title my review with a paraphrase of Bismarck's well known statement on Queen Victoria because it is so apt for this new biography.  Most people probably have a mental picture of Queen Victoria as a cold, remote statue frowning down at them.  Frigid and bigoted are two words that come to mind when her name is mentioned.  Now Christopher Hibbert has done a fine job of stripping away the stereotype and showing us the true Alexandrina Victoria with all her emotions intact.  This is indeed a personal biography, so you won't find a lot of information on the great political and social issues of her reign, but there are plenty of sources available for them if you want them.  If you want to know the real person behind the nineteenth century's most powerful monarch, Hibbert is for you.	2001-08-22

Their personal lives were deep and passionate, and they displayed an independence of thought and action which must have been truly revolutionary in their own time.

While it certainly does serve as a fine coda to this Great War, it also is an intriguing beginning to waht promises to be an even more exciting alternate history of the between war period and World War II.  Turtledove has tied up some lose ends and brought a few of his far flung characters together in some surprising ways.  He has also given us hints about what is happening in the world outside of North America.  Britain has been humbled but not crushed, France and Russia are in chaos (but Russia is apparently not Bolshevik, at least not entirely), and Germany rides supreme.  In the Western Hemisphere the United States has defeated the Confederacy and holds northern Virginia, Kentucky, Sequoyah (our Oklahoma) and part of Texas.  The US also has occupied all of Canada except for a semi-independent Quebec.  Triumphant in war, the US has turned to democratic socialism by electing Upton Sinclair President in 1920.  The CSA is in economic collapse, struggling with hyperinflation and huge reparation payments.  Thus far the Confederates have preserved their governmental system, but an ominous political movement has begun, centered around a charismatic leader who claims to speak for the defeated and to be the enemy of those who stabbed the South in the back.<br />Anyone familiar with twentieth century history can tell where things are likely to go in future volumes of Turtledove's alternate history, but that should not stop them from waiting with keen anticipation for the next installments.

Short biographies of John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, Miles Coverdale, et.al. are impressive because they show the strength and determination these men had.  They were literally taking their lives in their hands when they dared to challenge the official Church's doctrinal line.  Parallel translations included in the text demonstrate how profound doctrinal differences between Catholic and Protestant could develop over the translation (or mistranslation) of a word or two.  Bobrick provides some fascinating material on the men who worked on the various translations, not only those already well known but also on the hitherto almost anonymous, such as the committee members who created the Authorized or King James Version of 1611.<br />As the struggle for an English Bible continued, the notion of challenging the Official Version of things spread from religious to governmental matters, and the push to reform the English Church led to the push to reform English government.  That, in turn, led to the American push to end English control over the colonies. That insight alone makes the book well worth the price.	2001-07-26

Whatever his subject, from Harry Truman to the Johnstown Flood, McCullough makes the story come alive.  Now he has added a worthy successor to his earlier works in this new biography of our second President.  When most people think of John Adams (if they think of him at all) they imagine a dry, humorless fellow who was a valley of Presidential failure between two mountain peaks of Presidential success (Washington and Jefferson).  Now, thanks to McCullough, we can see Adams as he really was, intelligent and scholarly, but with wit (read his reply to the French lady who asked him about the origins of sex) and verve.  Furthermore, Adams was a deeply religious man whose faith in God was fundamental to his understanding of law and government.  Adams was fortunate in that he had a wife whose intelligence and spirit was a match to his own.  (The chapter &quot;Abigail in Paris&quot; is one of the most delightful sections of the book).<br />McCullough also reassesses the Adams Administration and reveals that it was far from a failure.  Adams steered a middle course between the pro-French Republicans and the pro-British High Federalists, earning himself the enmity of both and great public unpopularity, because he realized the US was in no condition to fight a war.<br />After his defeat in the 1800 election Adams was understandably embittered with his old friend Thomas Jefferson, but in another beautiful segment McCullough describes how the friendship was rebuilt so that it endured until the day Adams and Jefferson both died, July 4, 1826.<br />This is McCullough's masterpiece (thus far!)	2001-06-22

Keys is writing for the general public, not historians, and he provides timelines and charts to help his readers make the connections and draw the conclusions his material warrants.<br />The evidence Keys presents is interesting and certainly gives the reader a lot to ponder.

I suspect that The Disastrous Mrs. Weldon was written at least in part to take advantage of the audience which enjoyed Amanda Foreman's Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire.  On the surface the two women are quite similar (besides having nearly identical names.)  Both were headstrong, passionate women who were ultimately self-destructive.  The difference is that Georgiana Spencer Cavendish at least had a smattering of social conscience, enough to get involved in politics to help her Whig friends.  Georgina Weldon, on the other hand, rarely seems able to look beyond her own immediate need for gratification.  The Disastrous Mrs. Weldon is amusing and addictive (you'll be sorry when the book ends) and does point out that not all Victorians were rigid moralists, but ultimately it can't rise above the fact that its protagonist was shallow.	2001-06-22

John Adams is exceptional in that McCullough has managed to outdo even his works on Harry Truman and Theodore Roosevelt, which takes some doing, believe me.  The typical view of John Adams is that he was a dull, humorless failure of a President sandwiched between the two great success stories of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  McCullough shows us Adams the wit, Adams the innovator, and Adamsthe truly good man.  Furthermore, McCullough also lets us see the entire Adams family, especially Abigail, John's soul mate in every possible way; and his son John Quincy, a worthy heir to his giant of a father.  As Revolutionary leader, Adams was one of the first to be determined that the colonies should be free from Britain and one of the strongest representatives the country had in France, Holland, and England. As President, Adams had the thankless job of balancing between the pro-British High Federalists and the pro-French Republicans so as to keep the USout of a war which he knew we could not afford. Neither vain nor charismatic, Adams met the all too common fate of those who merely do a good job without hogging the limelight:  he was jeered, ignored, and pushed to one side while he still had many more years he could have served.  Another fascinating aspect of Adams' life which McCullough covers brilliantly is his long friendship with Thomas Jefferson.  The two men were quite different in style and manner, but were close friends for many years until political differences divided them.  I was very happy to read McCullough's account of how the friendship was restored after both men were in retirement, and to know that they kept in contact with each other almost up to the day they both died, July 4, 1826.	2001-06-20

Edward the Caresser is a fine biography of the Prince of Wales who became King Edward VII.  The title is slightly misleading since he was only called &quot;Edward the Caresser&quot; after he became King in 1901, and while he was Prince of Wales he was known to the public as &quot;Prince Albert Edward&quot;.  But such quibbling should be put aside.  This is a wonderfully entertaining story of a boy and man who had many fine qualities which were not appreciated by his parents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who set impossibly high standards for him and were constantly and openly disappointed when he failed to meet them.  Bertie (as he was known in the family) also had to deal with being compared to his  older sister and younger brother, who were their parents' favorites. After being made to bear the burden of being (in his mother's eyes) the chief contributor to his father's death, Bertie spent the rest of Victoria's reign looking for something to do.  Since the Queen refused to allow him constructive work,  having fun in various dissipations was his main occupation.  Given such a background, the fact that Bertie turned out to be a kind, good natured man with a wide circle of friends and a loving wife and family is surprising.<br />Stanley Weintraub always produces a fine biography, and I hope he will follow up on &quot;Edward the Caresser&quot; with another volume on Edward VII's reign.

She was to be the instrument by which the divided Germany of her youth was to be unified and remade in the image of Britain, a constitutional monarchy with leanings towards liberal democracy.  Vicky did her best to accomplish this, and to a point she succeeded.  She was a great and positive influence on her husband Frederick (Fritz) and helped wean him away from the Prussian militarism in which he had been raised.  Unfortunately, Vicky was unable to overcome the influence of Otto von Bismarck on her father in law Kaiser  William I.  Bismarck united Germany, but as an absolute monarchy with only a travesty of representative government.  More tragic was Vicky's failure to influence her son and Fritz's heir, the future Kaiser William II.  When &quot;Willy&quot; came to the throne after Fritz's tragic death in 1888, he inexorably led Germany down the road to World War I.<br />Since Vicky failed, why read her story?  Because she was a brilliant, brave, charming, stubborn woman dedicated to her principles.  She loved her family and both her countries with all her heart.  Today she should be remembered as a woman who could have changed so much history for the better had she only had the chance.	2001-04-18

The truth is rather different.  Michael was a talented man who wasted his time as a playboy when he could have been providing advice and assistance to his older brother, the Tsar.  Instead of doing his duty as a Romanov and marrying a Princess ( several were willing and eager to be his bride ), he fell in love with a woman who, regardless of her beauty and elegance, must be regarded as an adventuress.  Their narcissism meant Nicholas II had to worry about his younger brother's escapades when he had enough to do worrying about his empire.  I find it reprehensible that Michael chose to marry Natasha at the very moment his nephew Alexis lay close to death.  What is even more inexcusable is Michael's refusal to take the throne in March 1917, not from any noble motives, but from fear for his own safety.  While I'm sure Nichael and Natasha were pleasant people in St. Petersburg high society, they were completely unsuitable as part of a reigning dynasty.	2001-03-29

In her first years she led a privileged and pampered existence as the beautiful daughter of the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt and, more importantly, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria.  She could have married her cousin, the future Kaiser William II, but refused him in order to marry a rather strange and enigmatic figure, the Grand Duke Serge, younger brother of the Tsar.  This marriage is the first hint of mystery in Elizabeth's (Ella's) life.  Serge was a difficult, overbearing, probably homosexual man, and it is strange that Ella loved him as much as she evidently did.  She lived an opulent life in St. Petersburg and Moscow until January 1905, when Serge was assassinated.  Ella visited his murderer in prison and forgave him, then devoted the rest of her life to charity and good works as the founder and head of an order of Orthodox nuns.  During the Revolution she was arrested and cruelly murdered at about the same time as her yonger sister Alexandra and brother-in-law Nicholas II.

His hemophilia caused his mother, a temperamental and difficult parent to all of her children, to smother him with care and starve him of true affection.  It is a tribute to Prince Leopold's innate strength of character that he grew up to be mentally sound and in many ways the most gifted of the Queen's nine children.  His frequent illnesses forced him to assume a lower profile than did his siblings, but his love of creativity assured him warm friendships with many of the leading artistic and cultural lights of the Victorian era.  His ability to cope with his illness with grace and good humor makes his early death an even greater tragedy.  If he had lived on into the reign of his niece Alexandra, Empress of Russia, for example, he might have been able to proffer her some fatherly advice on how to handle her son's hemophilia, thus preventing her from falling into Rasputin's clutches.	2001-03-28

From my experience of the United States over the same period, I suspect that some of what he says is accurate, particularly as regards the schools.<br />I do not believe that Mr. Hitchens is correct in blaming the coarsening of culture on the ascension to power of a Â³LeftÂ² sometime in the last thirty five years or so, however. All I can say about that is that if it is true, it is a remarkably inefficient Left since Britain was governed by the Tories for much of that time. His claims that the Left seeks to make future Tory victories unlikely through ridicule by satirical TV shows are odd as well, since those programs were on the air right through the period of Tory rule, and I suspect the average British voter is able to enjoy political humor without being brainwashed, as Mr. Hitchens suggests. After all, here in the US most political humor in the last decade has been right wing, but that has not stopped the election and reelection of Bill Clinton and the election of Al Gore (stolen though it was).<br />This book reminds me of Robert BorkÂ¹s Â³Slouching Through GomorrahÂ², which also chronicles the decline of culture (American this time) as seen by a conservative. Both books look back to a sunnier time period before decadence set in, and blame progressive/ liberals or socialists for the cultural collapse. Both seem to be under the impression that in Â³the good old daysÂ² there were no problems, and both seem curiously unaware that in those days a lot of problems were ignored or covered up and a lot of people were pushed to one side. Mr. Hitchens often mentions the eighteenth century as a British golden age. I donÂ¹t know what the Hitchens ancestry is, but unless his forebears were gentry or aristocracy, I doubt that they would have considered their age to be as glorious as Mr. Hitchens claims. Nor do I find my memories of the 1950s (I am five years younger than Mr. Hitchens) to be as rosy as his.<br />The bookÂ¹s best part is the comparison of the Churchill and Wales funerals of 1965 and 1997. It is true that the cultural and social changes in those 32 years are amazing, but I think we are still far too close to them in time and emotion to adequately judge whether those changes have been as far reaching and as negative as Mr. Hitchens claims.e gentry or aristocracy, I doubt that they would have considered their age to be as glorious as Mr. Hitchens claims.

Its nice to have information on which Hapsburg has married which Oldenburg and what the present state of the monarchist cause is in various countries in Eastern Europe.  Historically the book is somewhat flawed by some sloppy research and/or editing.  For example, the chapter on the Belgian Royal Family is fraught with errors.  King Albert I is referred to as Alfred at one point, and there are numerous genealogical mistakes (Albert I was nephew, not son, of Leopold II).  I don't regret buying the book for its information on present day royals, but I would not rely on it for research on their predecessors.	2001-02-19

Jeremy Paxman has written an entertaining and affectionate look at the English people.  Wisely, he goes to some lengths to explain that English and British are not synonymous, though many foreigners assume that they are.  Overall, his view of the English is kindly, but he does not hesitate to skewer a few pretensions.  For example, he points out that the boorish behavior of some English soccer fans is not an aberration, but a throwback to pre-Victorian violence and drunkenness.  Nevertheless Paxman spends much time on the inner strengths of the English,such as their capacity to pull together and survive horrendous difficulties like the Blitz.  All in all inveterate Anglophiles will find much to enjoy and much to ponder in this work.	2001-02-19

This is the official biography of the present Queen's grandmother, originally published in 1959 or 1960.  Most official biographies are dull.  Queen Mary is not.  It accomplishes that which all biographies should desire:  not just a bare record of the subject's life, but an evocation of the subject's world.  Every home of Queen Mary is elegantly described.  Her travels in Italy and elsewhere and her visits to the homes of relations in England and in Germany are exhaustively but not boringly documented.  Pope-Hennessey's prose is stately, almost eighteenth century, but always lucid and often witty.  My favorite sections of the book are those dealing with Queen Mary's life before her marriage, when she was a morganatic princess with few prospects. Her often difficult and embarrassing early life made her a suitable prospect for a bride for the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, second in line to the British throne.  The Duke, or Eddy as he was known in the family, was a difficult young man with embarrassing habits (since this is an official biography written under the auspices of Buckingham Palace, Pope-Hennessey was necessarily circumspect about these habits.  You will not find a discussion of the Cleveland Street scandal here, for instance).  When Eddy died a few weeks after his engagement was announced, his fiancee (and the British Empire) was transferred to his more suitable younger brother George, Duke of York.  Although the circumstances of her marriage and ascent into the highest levels of British royalty were a little unusual, Queen Mary was the epitome of royal dignity for the rest of her life as Duchess of York, Princess of Wales, Queen Consort, and finally Queen Dowager.  Pope-Hennessey's coverage of the Queen's personal life is a bit limited,once again due to the limits placed on an official historian.  Her relationships with her husband and children, especially the Duke of Windsor, are not dealt with in much detail, and her personal peccadillos, such as her penchant for dropping broad hints about presents she would like, are not covered at all.  But there are plenty of unofficial sources if you are looking for that sort of thing about Queen Mary and her family.  Pope-Hennessey is the best choice for those looking for a beautifully written description of life in a vanished world.of Windsor, are not dealt with in much detail, and her personal peccadillos, such as her penchant for dropping broad hints about presents she would like, are not covered at all.

Nicholas II was an interesting figure, but he was the head of a large and fascinating family, most of whom are little known today.  &quot;Romanov Autumn&quot; gives some detail to the lives of these now obscure people.  One thing rather disconcerting is Zeepvat's use of unusual titles, like &quot;Tsesarevitch&quot; or &quot;Grand Prince&quot;.  Although she explains in her introduction that these are more accurate translations of the Russian titles, most people who read about the Romanovs are so used to &quot;Tsarevitch&quot; or &quot;Grand Duke&quot; that the new forms are jarring.  Nevertheless, a Romanov fan should not be without this book.	2000-12-08

If, like many of us, you are dispirited by most present day politicians, read &quot;American Dreamer&quot; and realize that it is possible to hold on to your ideals and still achieve something in US politics.  Henry  Wallace must have been one of the most intelligent men to serve our  country.  It is sobering to think he most likely would never be confirmed  as Secretary of Agriculture today, and certainly would never be considered  an appropriate choice for Vice President.  Imagine, someone who actually  thinks for himself in high office! Of course, idealism has its drawbacks,  and certainly Henry Wallace was blind to some of the less savory aspects of  his more leftist supporters.  Thus, although I would have liked to have  known Henry Wallace,  I certainly am glad he was not the Vice President on  April 12, 1945.	2000-07-31

It's too easy to dismiss potential fuhrers and  duces and their followers as marginal, uninvolved, and uninteresting  people.  We need to be reminded, as &quot;Diana Mosley&quot; does, that  anyone from anywhere can be entranced by evil.	2000-07-31

While compelling, Nicholas and Alexandra's tale leaves out much of the story of a once powerful Imperial Family and  its fall.  In the early twentieth century most people in Russia and Europe  probably considered the Romanovs to be spoiled dilettantes unworthy of  their high positions.  The Grand Dukes and Duchesses proved by their  courage and dignity in the face of disaster that they were indeed made of  sterner stuff.	1999-09-06

In the second volume of his alternate history of World War I Harry Turtledove continues to intrigue and delight me.  As a 15th generation Southerner and descendant of 7 Confederate soldiers, I cannot help but be  a little delighted by Turtledove's alternate world with a CSA twice  victorious over the USA.  But reading these books has helped me to further  recognize the positive role the USA has played in the twentieth century of  our own world.  Turtledove's world is poorer and bloodier than our world.  Would I trade worlds and go to live in his?  Not a chance, but I'll  continue to enjoy reading about his.	1999-08-11

I am pleased, because it whets my appetite for the succeeding volumes in this alternate history.  Turtledove is not creating a utopia here, this world in which the South defeated the North in the 1860s and again in the 1880s is a much poorer and more dangerous world than our own.  Nor is this a story of good vs evil.  Both sides commit brutalities as a matter of course, and there is no high flown rhetoric about saving democracy or ending war forever.  This World War I is openly about aggression and power.  I await the succeeding volumes breathlessly.	1998-06-25

Since we know the ultimate fate of this unhappy woman the banality and monotony of the last few months of her life have an unintentional sense of tragedy.

For more than sixty years this lady, usually known as Anna Anderson, was a center of controversy.  Thanks to DNA testing, it is now known that she was not Anastasia, but the daughter of a Polish peasant.  Although some of her followers still cannot accept this verdict, there is no reason to feel that Anna Anderson is lessened by the discovery of her true identity.  She was a consummate actress who rose from humble surroundings to be the consort of royals and near-royals on two continents.  The Quest for Anastasia makes an excellent companion for Robert K. Massie's The Romanovs: The Final Chapter and Nicholas and Alexandra.	1997-10-09
