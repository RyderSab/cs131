A few of the &quot;events&quot; were a little far-fetched but it didnt seem to matter because I was too busy trying to figure out the killer's next move and Rhyme's counter.  The book kept me thinking and rethinking from start to finish and had very few slow patches.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />I almost never give 5 stars but I really enjoyed the plot, theme and pace of this book...  Not to mention the return and continuing evolution of the familiar characters.	2003-03-30

I breezed through it in a couple days and thought I'd post my initial feelings here.<br />I only recently came across Patterson's books and have only read 1st To Die (which I thought was a little far fetched, but a fast entertaining read), Pop Goes the Weasel, and Roses are Red.  I enjoy his short, fast moving chapters and sustained energy.<br />That said, I was quite eager to be the first on my block to get a sneak peek at his new thriller.  Unfortunately, this book is no blood and guts thriller.  It*s more of a murder mystery... which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it didn*t have a completely hoakie plot.  I thought this book was a poor representation of what Patterson is capable of.  It's still a fast paced read but the plot seemed to me to be completely unrealistic and loosely held together with random afterthoughts.  Most of the characters seemed to have multiple personalities, doing things way out in left field with little or no explanation.  I found myself scratching my head a lot, thinking \\"where's the logic in that?\\" or \\"what are the chances this would happen like this?\\" (no one sees a character in 5 months and then suddenly in the middle of nowhere group A stumbles across him/her and 10 minutes later in a different middle of nowhere group B finds him/her).<br />Many times when reading a good book, you remember peculiarities throughout the story and find them neatly tied together at the end.  I didn't have that feeling with this book.  As I stated earlier, it seemed to be patched together with afterthoughts.<br />If you don't care whatsoever about logic or realism, you might like this book.  It moved along well enough and wasn't boring or hard to read... but there*s no way I would recommend paying hardcover price for it.  I'm a big fan of the other Patterson books I've read but this one frustrated me.  Wait for the paperback.	2002-06-19

Boris not Clarise). I was so pumped for serial killer thrillers after RD &amp; SOTL that I did allot of research and found Messiah had high reader ratings.<br />I would probably give the story itself an above average 4 stars. Though it was somewhat predictable (or maybe I just guessed lucky), I enjoyed the plot. I liked how it took some time to figure out exactly what the \\"bad guy\\" was up to and the many plot twists were interesting and well planned.<br />I wasn't as impressed with the writing. I found it to be average; not terrible, not great. I remember struggling through several chapters of boring character development that seemed to be pointless filler. There was plenty of background info but the characters still seemed flat. Same with the settings. I guess it was like reading in black and white where some other writers (Preston/Child, Harris, Crichton) seem able to write in full color. I'm also not big on novels written entirely in the present tense (but hey this is all about opinions, right?). I would recommend this book but it wasn't anything special.	2001-08-30

With Michel Thomas) (English and Italian Edition)	Books	5	54	56	N	N	Excellent but spring for the deluxe version	I ordered the deluxe version of this program a few weeks ago and have gotten through the first 2 cds. I thought i would have alot of trouble with this because I have never been good at language studies. I must say that after the first 2 cds i have learned a great deal very quickly with good retention. Most of what is taught in the first 2 cds is understanding how to use verbs and make simple sentences (I want to buy it, are you staying home tonight?,...) While this is great stuff, I think the 2cd version will definitely leave you wanting for more. At the end of cd2 in the deluxe version, Michel says &quot;this is the end of the introductory course&quot; so im sure that the deluxe set is this package plus another 6 cds. Basically, you will learn to understand how verbs and pronouns work in this version. He leaves you to memorize nouns on your own which is fine. As he says in the recording, &quot;if you understand how verbs are used in the language, you understand the language.&quot; multo buono!	2001-08-24

The Gunslinger begins the saga of Roland, an old west style gunfighter lost somewhere in a strange parallel world. It is a classic story of good vs. evil and only begins a race to the mythical Dark Tower. This book is a short fast read that sets up the plot for the Dark Tower series. The characters are imaginative and interesting, although King leaves allot of holes in the puzzles their pasts (to be pieced together in later installments). As a stand-alone book, it's average King but it's obviously essential if you want to try on this epic multi-book quest. A decent read that will leave you scrambling for answers in Part 2.	2001-08-24

In this installment, he serves up a fresh smorgasbord of human victims.  His stories all carry the same theme.  Remote villages are being torn to threads by big cats that have taken a liking to human flesh.  He is the world-renowned hunter with nerves of steel that must come to the rescue.<br />Corbett has a particular style that just makes for good reading.  He's not as suspenseful as someone like Capstick but still keeps the pages turning at a blur. I think his secret is that he is so in tune with his surroundings and his adversary.  He is able to paint a picture of exactly what he is thinking; and better yet... what the big cats are thinking.  He gives a completely objective view of the animals' behavior and reasons for killing rather than to make them out as some kind of evil hell-spawn.  He also thoroughly explains the native people's superstitions regarding these cats and the obstacles he has to overcome just to help them in spite of themselves.<br />His books are the stuff of legends.  They are best served over a glowing campfire and a MUST for hunters and adventure readers alike.  A+	2001-08-23

In The Ice Limit, Preston and Child have come up with an original realistic adventure that takes the reader to one of the most uninhabitable places on earth.  The thing that impresses me most  about this duo is the thoroughness of their research.  Every time they write a book on a new subject or profession, it comes across like they've been doing it all their lives.  The facts, lingo, and points of view are always right on target and ICE LIMIT is no exception.<br />My initial impulse was to give this book the typical praise of all the P/C books I've read but after thinking about it I'd have to say this book moved a little slower than most.  That's not to say that it wasn't interesting.  It just didn't carry the element of suspense and thrill that books like Relic and Riptide did.  Yes, there was always the element of what exactly is this thing they are digging up and there were a few monkey wrenches thrown in by the locals but I can't really consider that thrilling or all that suspenseful.  Toward the end, the book did pick up steam and ended as a real page-turner.<br />That's not to say I didn't enjoy this book.  The detailed writing of the settings, people, and operations were top notch and interesting.  The plot was well planned and wonderfully written.  The characters were well developed.  I would say that ICE LIMIT was a better written book than Riptide; probably on par with Mount Dragon.  It had enough plot twists to keep you guessing but lacked the excitement (at least in the first Â¾ of it) of some of their other books.  Still a recommended read at 4 stars.	2001-08-23

He killed more than a dozen of the worst man-eating leopards and tigers in India in the early part of last century but never beats his chest or commits an unethical act.  He was a true hunter and outdoorsman of the highest order and his stories reflect that.<br />You won't get any fluff or exaggeration with Jim Corbett.  He was the REAL DEAL and his chess matches against these infamous man-eaters are legendary.  From the 50 mile roadmarches to the 2 day stakeouts to the high suspense tracking of wounded killers, this man was tough as nails.<br />This book is one of his best and a must for any hunting/adventure collection.	2001-08-23

I was never really into fantasy type books or movies but having been a big SK fan, I had to read it anyway.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  EOTD is a classic story of kings, sorcerers, magic, and mayhem.  It is a sort of fairy tale type story that can be enjoyed by all ages.  The plot is well-organized and rock solid and the book is stuffed with King's brilliant descriptions of the settings and characters.<br />I found this to be both a fast and satisfying read.  I think it will make a terrific computer generated animation (Toy Story or Shreck type) movie someday.  Five stars!	2001-08-22
US	51029106	RU5ZSZWDF5QJN	0451169514	380266608	It	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Epic tale of FEAR	IT is a well-crafted tale concentrating on people's greatest fears.  Long ago, a group of youngsters went through a terrible experience.  Once it was over, they all agreed to swear themselves to secrecy.  Many years later, the group is reunited to find that the evil has returned and they must face it again together once and for all.<br />This book gets out of the blocks slowly, mainly because there are so many characters to develop.  It's unique in that King writes essentially two books here; one tells the story of the original incident when the characters were children and the other guides us through their present time struggle to stop the mysterious killer as adults.  The novel switches from one time to another just about every chapter so you never really learn the outcome of either plight until the very end.<br />All-in-all this book is entertaining and original reading.  Once you learn the background of each person, it picks up nicely and keeps you guessing `til the end.  I found the ending a little strange and unsatisfying but the story was a good read regardless.	2001-08-22

Suddenly, an evil haze sweeps over the village and people start dying.  This book is a masterfully written tale of a few unlikely heroes trying to save their town from a ruthless villain.<br />Unlike many of his books, King gets out of the gate quickly with this one and keeps a good pace throughout.  The writing is excellent, showing the story evolve from the points of view of several characters.  His ability to paint a detailed picture of the dark, gloomy landscape is chilling and classic King.  More than any of his other books, 'Salem's Lot got my heart pumping and kept the pages turning.  This is his best work in my opinion.  Highly recommended.	2001-08-22

Unlike many of his novels, you don't have to wade through 200 pages of background information in this one before things get started.  This book is fast paced and full of adventure.  A young girl and her father are on the run from a government agency that has discovered the two have certain supernatural powers.  The chase consumes the entire novel and climaxes in a satisfying ending.<br />Many times, King either starts off fast and peters out at the end or drags his feet 500 pages to an exciting ending.  This story sets a good pace and continues it all the way to the end.  Highly recommended!	2001-08-21

Last Horizons is a departure from Capstick's usual storytelling of high danger hunting in Africa.  This book consists of an archive of his articles and short stories written for Peterson's Hunting and other outdoor magazines.  Though the stories are short, they are still written in Capstick's classic form and provide for excellent entertainment.<br />These articles not only provide a good read but are informative as well.  Many people criticize Capstick for his tendency to exaggerate (I can buy into that line of thinking as well) but you cant deny his thorough researching.  I found several of the articles  (ex. effectiveness of shot size) to be extremely insightful and educational.  The articles on air rifles and rat hunting were entertaining and excellent lessons in ballistics and the importance of practice.<br />This book is not typical Capstick and probably not for everyone.  True, some of the information is outdated but if you are an avid hunter you will find this collection both informative and valuable.  It reminded me of sitting there listening to an old man telling stories learned by years of experience and trial mixed in with several well spun yarns.  The pig sticking story had to have been written sitting around a campfire.  Good stuff!	2001-08-20

Capstick reprises his role as master yarn-spinner of African legend in Dark Continent.  The book is entirely devoted to Africa's \\"Big Five\\" dangerous game animals; lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, and buffalo.<br />This hi-octane collection of stories ranks second only to \\"Long Grass\\" as my PHC favorite.  It is completely FULL of experiences, legends and tales of close calls or catastrophes.  Capstick goes chapter by chapter showing us without a doubt why each animal is included among Africa's Dangerous Game.<br />The stories themselves are heart pounding.  Capstick can put you behind the sights and in the path of a charging rhino like no one else.  You'll be bathed in sweat as he drags you through the thick Mopane scrubb searching for that man-eating leopard or gut-shot lion.  Ol' Pete may be the most thrilling safari adventure writer of all time.<br />In addition to the danger, PHC also takes us back in history to the golden days of the White Hunter and relives the world record trophy hunts in each category.  You'll hear about giant tuskers with 200lbs on each side, massive 10ft lions, and rhinos big enough to derail a train.  I found this wonderful reading.  It was like going to a world record trophy museum and getting a behind-the-scenes look at each hunt.<br />This book is a MUST for anyone who enjoys safari legend, hunting, or adventure.  Highly recommended.  I guess you could say I give it a \\"Big Five.\\"	2001-08-20

Given that, I have to say that The Lost World was a huge disappointment for me.  It is clear that as a book, it makes a helluva good action film.  That's about all there is here.  He obviously wrote this book just to sell the movie rights.<br />There's plenty of thrilling action here but all of the magic storytelling of Jurassic Park is gone.  The characters are flat and the plot was alot more original when it was done 65 years ago in King Kong.<br />The book is basically a script for the movie, if you've seen it don't bother reading it.	2001-08-17

This book is absolutely GREAT!  While the idea of a monsterous villian stalking and killing helpless people is nothing new, Preston and Child have come up with a refreshing and interesting way to develop this killer and have created an extremely spooky setting.<br />From page one, you can see that this book is something special.  You are immediately thrown into the heart of the Amazon jungle in search of a tribe of legendary and much feared natives.<br />Next, the authors send you to to New York City.  The rest of the novel is set in a huge old dark museum filled with countless natural artifacts, forgotten passages, a very nasty killer, and a lot of fresh blood.<br />I hate giving anything away about plots in my reviews so hopefully that will be enough to set the stage.  This book is very well written, the character development is thorough, the scientific explanations are complex but written in such a way as not to confuse the layman.<br />I really enjoy the way P&amp;C always like to throw in a little scientific tidbit every chapter or two to keep you guessing as the story unfolds. They also hold nothing back when it comes to graphic depiction of the violence in this tale.  The book itself practically drips blood.<br />If you are into the scientific thrillers, this is as good and original as Jurassic Park.  If you easily get bogged down by all the biological explanations and computer jargon, you're probably not a Preston/Child fan anyway.  Even so, this book still carries a white knuckle plot and a heavy dose of gore to pull you through.  Maybe not for those prone to nitemares.	2001-08-17

I have read accounts of animals attacking people (having lived in Alaska I was well studied in all of the bear attack books) but I soon found out that a Capstick book is a completely different animal.  Up 'til Maneaters, my level of interest in such stories was directly related to the events themselves; i.e. &quot;shark devours swimmer as horrified beachcombers look on&quot;  would be better than &quot;man escapes close call when black bear enters tent.&quot; Capstick, on the other hand,  is seemingly able to take a news clipping and make you feel like you are the one getting stomped into a puddle by that rogue elephant.<br />Maneaters basically goes chapter by chapter through all of nature's species that have, in significant numbers, one of two qualities.  Either they have taken to the consumption of human flesh, bones, hair or other parts; or they have typically found enjoyment in tap-dancing on, poking holes in, delimbing, tenderizing, or poisoning unfortunate, unwary people.<br />Capstick goes back through history and bring to life true cases of human/animal encounters.  The entire book is case after case of attacks or close calls.  He does an excellent job of explaining the circumstances, events, and outcomes of each entry and while the book is entirely a collection of story stories, it flows nicely and is a fast read.<br />Everybody turns up the television when the news comes on and says someone was mauled by a bear or bitten by a shark.  This book is that multiplied by a hundred and there is no better newscaster than Peter Hathaway Capstick!	2001-08-16

When I saw the cover of this book, I hesitated and thought &quot;Man, I hope this isn't a 90's version of King's &quot;The Stand&quot;. After all that book was an epic tale but it took me like a year to read and I wasn't &quot;up&quot; for another run at the same thing.  I'm happy to say that the only real similarity Mount Dragon has to The Stand is &quot;the superflu&quot;, &quot;Cap'n Tripps&quot;, &quot;X-FLU&quot;, whatever you want to call it; a doomsday virus capable of wiping out the human race.<br />I'm not one to tell anyone any secrets so I'll just say this:  This was a very well written book,  It's an adventure that takes place in the New Mexico desert in a Genetic engineering lab.  Yes, the main plot is working with a doomsday virus but there is much more to this story than that! It has high tech computer hacking, industrial espionage, history and legend, cat and mouse chases, and more plot twists than you can shake a test monkey at.<br />Honestly, I was very entertained by this book.  It wasn't what I expected but that was a pleasant suprise.  I constantly found myself hitting a major crisis and saying &quot;how can this be happening?  I still have XXX amount of pages left here.&quot;  Not just once, but several times.  The book always kept my interest and every time I thought I had the whole thing figured out, the authors threw in another twist.<br />If you like adventure, you'll enjoy this book.  Solid writing and character development throughout, a good branching plot, excellent technical and scientific explanations, and the ending was well conceived and not rushed.  Thumbs up on this one, not a 5 star (which I seldom give) but a strong 4.	2001-08-13

This collection contains his most challenging hunts including The Man-Eating Leopard of Rudraprayag, The Chowgarh Tigers, and The Thak Man-eater.  Corbett personally had over a dozen real life assignments against known man-killers and these stories are the best of the best.  His targets were reportedly responsible for over 1500 human deaths and countless injuries.  Given the remote locations and the fact that deaths resulting from infection, etc. were not counted, that total can probably be doubled or even tripled.<br />Corbett, in his writings, takes you right into the jungles of 1920s India and you'll be hard pressed to find an author who knows more about his surroundings.  His success as a hunter results from his ability to get into the minds of these man-eaters and predict their next moves.  Corbett does an excellent job of explaining his thoughts as to the reasons these animals have turned to killing humans and remains very objective.  Though his job was to destroy these dangerous creatures, it is clear in his writings that he had a profound respect and admiration for them.<br />If you are a fan of hunting stories and legends, you will love this collection of tales.  Each one is an ongoing cat and mouse game between man and beast.  Corbett was the best at beating the world's most dangerous animals on their own terms and Man-eaters will be a book you can't put down.  Guaranteed!	2001-08-09

Don't get me wrong here, I'm one of the biggest Capstick fans there is but what I've seen from him is this:  He either writes a nail biting account of personal or researched adventures or he rambles on about some boring life chronology spiced up by only a few tidbits of adventure or peril.  Thats the way parts of Silent Places is and thats how this book is.  If you are a fan of John Taylor or are interested in getting a history lesson of the everyday life of someone like him, then you'll probably enjoy this book.<br />Me, I'm a fan of the man who writes about the true life (or not)near death experiences of Corbett, Patterson, and himself in exotic bush locations in a time long since forgotten.<br />I knew what I was getting into when I bought this book but, hey, it's a Capstick book and I have to read 'em all.

In reading these stories, you will find that Jim Corbett is not a man out for fame, trophies, or money.  In fact, his respect and admiration for the great cats that he hunts goes without question.  You find no hatred for these maneaters and in his first words discusses typical reasons these cats turn to human flesh.  Its refreshing to see a man in his position with such an objective point of view.<br />At any rate, these tales are the stuff of legend and should be savored by any person interested in hunting, adventure, or the true history of early 1900s India bush life.  If you fall into any of these categories, you will love this collection.  Guaranteed!	2001-08-08

I expected a similar tale of long hunting and trapping excursions, encounters with Indians, and an overall historical/fiction representation of this great outdoorsman's life.  Unfortunately, as I read on, the main emphasis was more on Crockett's political ties and town life.<br />Might have been a good history lesson for some but sure wasn't what I was looking for.  I had to put it down.  Get Boone if you can find it.  It's a much better book.	2001-08-03

I found it to be a wonderfully original story full of detailed scientific explanations and powerful plot twists. What an adventure!<br />Scientists come up with the ability to genetically engineer dinosaurs from their DNA material.  Excentric millionare John Hammond has a dream.  He wants to make an incredible new tourist attraction; a zoological park consisting entirely of dinosaurs.<br />Well, things start out smoothly but eventually problems occur.  From there things snowball and Hammond's dream begins to turn into a terrible nightmare.<br />Crichton does a great job of explaining the intricate and exciting scientific procedures, taking you right into the labratory.  His writing is exceptional, the plot is one of the most original, interesting, and captivating ones ever put to paper.  Who hasn't been to a museum and thought &quot;I wonder what it would be like if this huge pile of teeth and bones still roamed the earth.&quot;<br />There's nothing bad I can say about this book.  Great storyline, excellent conflicting character development, facinating science, and a satisfying ending.  I could say that to someone who doesn't care for all the detailed genetic and computer jargon there could be a few slow spots. But not me, I love that junk! Thumbs up!	2001-08-03

It brings together historical facts from the time of this early pioneer and adds a host of interesting fictional characters and adventures.  Nothing like a 12 month trapping and hunting excursion to make a guy homesick...well, at least for a couple days or so.<br />I was impressed with this book.  Definitely a recommended read.	2001-08-03

Wow, what a life he led!  If even half of it is true its an amazing tale in the spirit of Jeremiah Johnson.<br />What this man goes through is unbelievable and makes for a heck of a page turner.  Great historical/fiction mountain man story.	2001-08-03
US	51029106	R12Q256N65APIM	0446607177	11618814	Riptide	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Have you heard of the Oak Island &quot;Money Pit&quot; treasure?	Child and Preston have taken the real life story of Oak Island and brought to life a white knuckle treasure hunting adventure. While this book was a little too predictable in places for me to give it 5 stars, it definitely held my attention throughout. The constant slow-feed of tidbits of the treasure's history and the wrath of the dread pirate as it related to the dig really kept the story going. A step below Relic but still a great read.	2001-08-02
