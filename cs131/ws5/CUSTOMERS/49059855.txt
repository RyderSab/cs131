This has the basic knowledge need to manage your finacing ranging from simple budgeting, credit, stocks and mutual funds, Certificate of Deposit, how to read the market and the prime rate and what it all means. Also, it provides the mental mindset you need to manage and spend money properly, without resorting to short term spending splurges. There's tables for calcuating college funds, morgages, and retirements but most importantly how to avoid the many traps and scams many vendors use to make money off of you without providing any extra services. The one thing I found somewhat worrysome is the way the authors protrayed the banks and other institutions to the point of scaring the reader into being nearly paranoid of all financial instistutions. The fees these institutions charge are describe in the book with good details. A good \\"how to avoid pitfalls\\" book.	2003-07-06

I wanted to read this book ever since seeing the infomercial of Scott doing his thing on tv. I couldn't afford or justify the expense to buy the big commerical package so this book had to do. The methods are easy to follow and Mr. Flansburg does a good job expressing his mind set in how he mentally did the problems. The basic addition and multiplications methods are good but the examples were insufficient when dealing with mixed numbers of different lengths. There were also exceptions to many of the rules that weren't expressed. Finally, the last part of the book with special rules were so numerious it would take a year to effectively learn and apply them all from memory. This leads me to believe that Mr. Flansburg didn't tell everything he knows, like the quick way to determine change -- by changing say ten bucks to 9.99 and subtracting that from the amount owed; then add one cent to get the correct change. It's easier to subtract 9 since its the highest value you can have in each column. This was presented by him on a night time radio show he was a guest on. I do give him prasie for getting people young and old to stop depending on calculators and learn mental speed math.	2003-07-02

Basically, it's turning your message into a commerical since the average person can only hold their attention for 30 seconds thanks to (M)TV. It's useful in getting a message across to individuals who either don't want to talk to you or are too busy quicky. It can be seen as \\"brute honesty\\" if it's news the individual doen't like to hear, especially, regarding personal performance.Could be very useful in sales and retail. The book uses the 3 Ks (KKK). Unfortunately, it's not a good (PC) memory aid. I perfer the 3 Cs. \\"Catch Em\\", \\"Ceep Em\\", \\"Convince Em\\".

This is a very effective message in managing and communicating with people under your charge. It can be applied in any situation whether military or civilian. It's more effectve when used in a small group in my opinion. You can see the one minute manager technique in action simply by watching shows like &quot;ST: Next Generation&quot;.  Capt.

The book is divided into different levels of leadership starting with self and moving on from squad leader, platoon, all the way to executive positions where the main goal is sucess and direction of the organization and less on individuals of the organization (Visionary). The book is more for military than for civilians in that it pushes WP philosophy heavily. In fact, it seems, in some sense, written strictly for WP cadets. It shows through stories and discussions how a leader's decision can make or break a mission. Since the book is only 160 pages; it's worth a look.	2003-06-15

It's an easy read and can be applied immediately to you situation. The book brings the basics of leadership traits and principles to the reader similar to the military leadership books I've read in the USMC. So many times have I held jobs where a manager, although excellent in managing projects, through some lack of sensitity or judgement created an uproar that cause moral to fall and people to become resentful and leave. There are many stories in the press of managers and CEOs restricting \\"bathroom breaks\\", playing favorites, freezing wages and laying off employees while taking huge \\"bonuses\\" like American Airlines and ENRON. What's present here is basic but essential information for anyone in a leadership roll whether at work, church functions, or managing a family trip. This should be required reading for everyone BEFORE you find yourself in a situation as leader. The boss could be out for a whole month  tommorrow.

These books are targeted at school age teens to inspire them to follow their paths for success. The author seems to cover the life stories of Bill Gates and adds quotes where appropriate to boost the storyline. There are occasional segments on subjects related to Gates as shown in the Amazon's \\"Look in\\" review. It's an easy read with only 230 pages. If you read any of the other books such as \\"Gates\\" or \\"Hard Drive\\" you'll get the feeling of reading this book before. Since the work isn't original and seems to heavily reference other books I give it 3 stars. The only question I have is whether the author actual sat down with Bill Gates and talked to him or did she really just go to the library, the Internet, etc. to get info on the book. As a first book on Bill Gates life, it's still a good read for young adults looking to be inspired.	2003-06-08

It goes into the life of Bill Gates; his thought process, his work ethics, his childhood and how Microsoft established it's dominance. It's a good read even though it's over 500 pages. I highly recommend this book along with the book &quot;Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire&quot;. This is the way it really happened.

Books	1	62	130	N	N	Living with Rose Colored Glasses in the land of OZ	The author is a master of the english language and seems to have an answer for everything. The title question itself is flawed since it's an all or nothing question. It's a universal question that cannot be answered yes or no. A better question should be \\"Is racial profiling affecting the freedoms and quality of life of the individuals affected? If so, does this create pinned up resentment and anger to the police conducting the profiling?  What negative impact does racial profiling have on the population affected? Does this cause border line individuals to go over the edge and turn to a life of crime and disrespect towards the law because of excessive police harrassment (mental paranoia)? Does profiling create a never ending cycle rivaling the Middle East crisis? The fact she did do research does NO good if the author has ALREADY determined, beforehand, that the police are right to use questionable methods to \\"get the bad guys\\". The law-biding citizen just has to deal with it (just so long as it's not \\"me\\" as any person would say). The spin she's giving does not reflect the real world. Cops are human and being human they bring there own human preferences and bias, good and bad to their job. Some have military, bodyguard, bounty hunter, and security experience they bring to jobs. The question of racial profiling is real. It's not just \\"driving while black\\"; but \\"walking while black\\" and \\"living while black\\" as I can personnally testify to. If we're so sensitive in being fair to people in Iraq and Afghanistan - why can't we do that here in our American communities. The author doesn't acknowledge black leaders of the community. Even though they are not elected officals, and less than perfect, doesn't mean they can't bring to the table concerns of the black communities they are serving. They have news worthy media attention unlike myself. I finally finished the book after becoming angry over what I was reading. I revised my review, but my overall outcome remains unchanged. She really needs to walk in a black person's shoes before giving filtered facts and interviews to fit her arguements. Arguements  that she already made her mind up on before conducting the research. I know enough not to introduce personal bias to scientific research to get a desired result -- without even going to an ivory league school.<br />______MY ACCOUNT OF WHY I'M SO HARSH ON THIS \\"MYTH\\" AS THE AUTHOR PUTS IT: I'm middle age and have no car. I work 2 jobs and I'm a former Black Marine. I have been stopped over 30 times at various times of the day, while walking to the bus or running my miles to stay in shape. I have been stopped at gunpoint; and while cleaning the store's parking lot at my job \\"while in uniform\\"; you name it--it happened. I have been embarrassed by the stops when they pull up 2 or 3 cars with lots of people around. After searching and questioning me they let me go with little or no apologies. The reason: \\"such and such store got robbed and it was a Black/Arab/Hispanic guy\\" -PLEASE. Do they stop every white person when some white person robs a store? No, they use a description as they should be using with all incidents such as this. I had my apartment mistakenly raided at 4am in the morning and afterwards they claim they were responding to a noise complaint. I personally have NO record not even a traffic ticket. One time, I was taken downtown because the officer didn't believe the ID data in the computer laptop in the vehicle. I lived in 3 major cities in California. It's all the same. I have few friends so I'm not associating with the criminal element. I'm just a large old Marine. I've seen abuses and much disrespect. Most of the trouble I had was with the LA and San Jose PD. What usually gets me out of trouble is my Marine tattoo (gang units look for tattos) and my Military Reservist card. I still respect the police. It's just too bad  their proactive approach towards people are hostile until proven otherwise. There are countless incidents in the media of raids gone bad (New York) and innocent people being locked up on false charges (Texas). It's how they react after they're actions that really gets me. They want to go home to they're families at the end of a shift. So do I!!  No one should live here in the U.S.A. like this is the old U.S.S.R.ts in the media of raids gone bad (New York) and innocent people being locked up on false charges (Texas). It's how they react after they're actions that really gets me. They want to go home to they're families at the end of a shift. So do I!!

It's not at all clear on Network theorem and Laws with some errors. The math examples are very difficult to follow and doesn't explain the process and mostly uses symbols and not actual numbers in the examples. No explainations for how they derived Norton and Thevenin equvalent circuits for FETs and Bipolar transistors. Explaination of load lines and digital sections are good.

Books	3	16	18	N	N	Dated, long winded but useful...	After reading &quot;Unlimited Power&quot;, I was eagerly expecting this book. It wasn't what I expected. I originally read this book 2 years ago. Since then, I've read it 2 more times. The book is dated with references to OJ, Micheal Jackson, to name a few. Each have fell off the deep end. (OJ trial, Jackson's behavior) The book is also overwritten in my opinion. He's constantly asking questions every other sentence. (I got the feeling I was  being cross-examined.) The author uses a conversional language as if the book was being dictated on a recorder for later type up.  This at times leads to rambling about everything from his family members, friends, the play Les Mis&eacute;rables, his trip to Figi, his company, Mr.Smith, his visit to a morgue. It reminds me of being stuck on the phone with a friend for 3 hours straight listening to every bit of gossip and trivia. The last reason I give it 3 stars - he starts being too preachy around page 300 on; from taking up causes to eating less beef. On the plus side, there are some useful bits - from identifying the values that are important to you to making the right decisions and breaking habits. At 511 pages, the book is more like a handbook than a book that should be read outright. The finacial part of the book came near the end of the book and covers only one chapter with 5 keys to wealth. One key I disagree with partly as being outdated. Creating wealth by being more valuable to your company for example doing 3 times more work or adding value to your work is ok if you're self-employed, but as an employee I found that for you to become more wealthy you need to have fair mind employers to recognize your creative efforts and give you those raises to increase your income. I've found many employers simply pocketing the savings their employees come up with and not even acknowledge their efforts to avoid giving raises. This is mainly true in low end jobs like fast foods. Down-sizing has made this key advise mandatory just to KEEP your job. The author needs to update this book and reduce the number of stories and personal accounts in the next edition. To start out, I would recommend &quot;Unlimited Power&quot; instead and only &quot;Awaken the Giant&quot; as a supplement reference manual to &quot;Unlimitd Power&quot;.ur job.

This book should be required reading for all military. Dick Couch takes you from the time they report in to indoctrination through all the phases and what happens to them after graduation. As a former Marine, I wished I had read this book before leaving the Corps in '97 \\"after feeling sorry for myself\\" for all the stuff I put off with. One thing I never realized was how many Marines resigned or leave the Corps, joined the Navy for a \\"chance\\" to be a SEAL. The Corps part of the Dept of the Navy. THe Commandant and the Secretary of the Navy should get together to offer this opprotunity to Marines so they don't risk Professional suicide trying to be a SEAL as it stands now. One story about a Marine officer resigning to enlist in the Navy blew me away. I don't know whether I should praise him or call him a fool. Also, Class 228 feature the first black to graduate BUDS in years. The author for whatever reason did not point this milestone out and only mentioned him in passing. Book is still good. I'll read it over and over whenever I need motivation and start feeling \\"sorry\\" for myself. Add this with the video of Class 234 and I have the complete Seal experience without trying out for them. Marines should READ this book!! Don't let the fact it's a Navy book keep you away.

The book has little humor for a Complete Idiot book. It was more a study of leadership at different levels and situations then a how to for the reader to take on the task of a leadership position. It covered leadership in low level team leaders to CEO and Visionary. The information is sound but what about the beginner being thrown into a leadership position? What traits and characteristics does the person need? The book touched on leadership styles but didn't really go into it. How's the leader suppose to take his team and successfully accomplish the goals set out by the situation? This in my opinion was never answered. Conflict resolution was touched on in a chapter but wasn't really addressed to it's full extent. I got more information from Marine Corps MCI \\"Leadership\\" and other books mainly with a military slant. The book had some self tests here and there but they were mostly subjective. Being former military, I read this book to improve my leadership and management abilities in the civilian world. The book is good if your researching the subject and not doing it. A CEO is in trouble if he needs to read this book. I strongly disagree with the statement that a leader should not apologize even if they wrong somebody. I got more out of \\"One Minute Manager\\". It just wasn't for me after reading it for over a week.	2002-12-12

There's a more recent edition out by the author. There are many references to California personalities mainly in the bay area in the examples. The ten commandments at the end of the book is a handy reference sheet. Chapter 13 though interesting regarding how she meet her husband and got the book deal; it really wasn't necessary.

The diagrams are easy to read and follow. The slant of the book focuses on the communication aspects of electronics starting off with a definition of communications and explaining and surprisingly clear detail the definitions you will come across. A good refresher chapter covers Ohm's Law, transistor and FETs configurations and a real good section on couplings and their effects on the signal. Diagrams of the spectum analyzer's screen is used to explain modulation with out getting technical. All the math is basic algebra with no calculus in sight. There's a page in chapter 4 that helps you in designing common emitter amplifiers. AM, FM, sideband is covered including standing wave ratio and antenna theory. I wish I had this book when I was learning radio communications in the military. It's only 200 pages but the information provided is enough to get the beginning student up to speed quickly.

There is very little math here in favor of familarizing the reader with the many elements found in digial electronics. It starts first with a chapter on electrical safety. From there the author covered the basics of transitor (1 paragraph each). He then goes on to cover Binary, HEX, Octal, BCD, and Gray scale which was brief but informative. The next chapters goes into TTL circuits, logic gates and pin outs on the most common TTL ICs like 7400, 7404, 7432 etc. This is the most informative part of the book. It's brief - covering adders, counters, flip-flops, shift registers, memory. D/A and A/D circuits. Some effort is made to explain the process behind logic gates and flip-flops, and counters but cmae off clumsily. The diagrams are large with many taking over the whole page. The part covering microprocessors was very brief and seems to have been done in a rush. I got more info out of a magazine. The author ends the book by showing the many applications digital electronics contributes to. The last chapter gives good information on basic project constructions including soldering techniques and component identifications (resistor color codes, ic polarity etc.) In general, the book is very light and can easily be covered in a day or two. The diagrams are large bordering on becoming a picture book. With the exception of applications, the data is still good even though the book was printed in 1986. Nothing is mentioned on K-maps that would add greatly to the book. One smart thing he did was to place the application part at the end. Of all the books I read that applications was the most boring part. Other electronics books should follow this example. A good companion book if used with a text book.	2002-10-04

The first page shows they are very politically correct in their writing to ensure no gender or culture is left out. I loved the newspaper style columns that are easy to read. The ink drawings are well done with direct quotes sprinkled throughout the book. As for the actual writing, most of the ideas in the book I came across in earlier books(\\"Working Smart\\"). In a nut shell, they advise creative people to take their time, move from task to task as they feel like it. Go out and play, even though you have high priority project with a close deadline. (The Ant and the Grasshopper\\" comes to mind here.) The authors also spent a chapter knocking time management sayings such as &quot;A messy desk is a sign of a cluttered mind&quot; or &quot;Handle each piece of paper once.&quot; They took these says too literally. They referred to many people in business whom I've never heard of saying how they used various techniques on the job to better control their time like scheduling meetings close to quitting time to keep the meeting from running long. If the workers want to stay after because the issue isn't resolved; its on their time I guess. That lead to workers doing things outside of their responsibilities. Here they used Southwest Airlines as an example. (The CEO's ink drawn picture is on the back of the book.) I must say SW Air is a well run company, but what works for them can be taken to disastrous levels in other industries under penny pinching mangers. Though the family atmosphere in a company environment is appealing; it's not realistic. I had previously been employed at companies that had that philosophy. As soon as business got bad, they laid us off without warning and went back to the old way of doing business.  SW employees save the company money by having attendants clean cabins instead of a professional cleaning crew; off duty crew members helping out on flights serving passengers. It's looks admirable at first glance but when company managers start expecting this on a regular basis then that's were creativity and motivation goes down the drain. The message they deliver is confusing at best, possible due to the fact there's two authors. How to say \\"NO\\" to tasks even high priority ones could get someone fired if followed as written in the book. The book is more a discussion on Time management then a how to guide. What was once creative and innovating for individual workers is now expected. Downsizing has made this book obsolete for all but the self employed, housewife and artists. I wanted to give them 1 1/2 stars for the books layout but I had to give them whole stars. DOT-COMS used this philosophy and now they're gone. You can pass on this one.

It remainded me of a teacher in an electronic class I took who would always stray off the subject matter and talk for hours about old sea stories or the chemical compounds in food instead of the matter at hand. If the author's job is to help me plan my life; he's failed miseribly. I've NEVER came across a book that had a Preface that's 52 pages long. I read prefaces to maximize the use of the book. Yes, the author gave 5 ways to use the book but to start off with this universal study of man's place in the cosmos isn't my ideal of how to get my career planned. My advise to him is take this book and rewrite it. Shave off 50 - 60% of it and try again. If there's any useful tid bits in the book why should I waded through 700 pages to find those few pages of interst. I'm planning a career not taking a Social Studies class. I'm disappointed.	2002-09-17

The next chapter goes into troubleshooting equipment and tools which was good. Beginning with the chapter on maintenance, it tries to show the parts that need to be lubricated and cleaned. With &quot;Determining the Problem&quot; chapter, the amateur is left behind in favor of the seasoned technician, introducing acromnyms and VCR model numbers without explaination. From there on, it gets worse with full schematic diagrams guaranteed to have beginners running to the service center.

The following chapters goes in to problems with each section of the vcr ending with case studies of classic problems likely to be encoutered by techs. I a have background in digital and audio electronics but haven't work in video electronics (TV) since 1981. I thought this book with it's 180 pgs and medium text would get me up to speed on the state of the art. Unforuntately it failed for me. I gave it 2 stars since it could help seasoned service techs with better a better background on the subject then myself. I'm opting for a text book.	2002-09-05

The pages are full of information from physical training, correct ways to perform a jab, upper cut, right cross, and various kicks. How to work the ring and hold your own against an opponent. Trivia on different leagues, a weight class table, and suprisingly a page on hand wraps and types of gloves and equipment. I read it in one sitting. A real guide book for beginners.	2002-08-29

It started out ok showing basic resistors, capacitor, inductors for dc and ac circuits. It was surprisingly light on mathematics considering you need to use math to determine current, total resistance and the like. It began to unravel after the chapter on tubes. Classes of amplifiers were given a paragraph each. Power supplies were mentioned with nothing mentioned on how to design one. Horn went into basic radio amplification and antenna. Mentioning Hedrodyne in only one small paragraph!!! Everything was glossed over. A lot of this material could have been left out to focus more on the basics. He writes about antennas and wavelengths (so-so) yet never defined or mentioned wavelength in the book so the beginner can follow him. The chapter on stereos should have been dropped. CD one paragraph. The material is dated on computers and stereos.(Pre-internet boon) Microprocessors were explaned in block diagram format. Lousy questions like which method is popular. Who cares which is popular when you happen to have a rare unit that needs to be fixed with that technology. Stages of a radio receiver? Basic TV? The math it did have had errors and were jumbled up in the text. The book was easy to read though. The experiments could have been design better. What beginner is going to have a signal generator? Recommended only as light reading to see what electronics is all about or as a refresher. I'm not an expert on electronics. I read over 500 pages and really didn't feel I got anything out of it. Get a good text book.	2002-08-28

Its easy to read and follow. It explains the commands and basic programming logic so you can begin to program immediately. QuickBasic and the free version QBasic are becoming outdated but excellent for starting programming. This lays a strong foundation for programming that leads to the next stage - Visual Basic 6.0.<br />Visual Basic is based on Quick Basic.	2002-08-28

Starts with a test of present skills and moves into various reading techniques. Goes into grouping words, pacing, building comprehension through reviewing and finishes up with a self test. The book is more like a &quot;Cliff&quot; book with only 135 pages in medium type. I've read several books on speed reading from &quot;Evelyn Woods&quot; to &quot;Reading Smarts&quot; and the one thing I've found is that all of the books are formatted to make it &quot;easier to speed read&quot;(medium text, easy words, low words per line counts). After finishing the book at rates of 700 to 800 wpm I go to &quot;normal&quot; books only to be shocked by lines that are twice as long, big words, and various text sizes. Loved the idea on taking notes. I'll increase my cash return reselling my old college books to the book store. Dots are less noticeable. I avoid hand scanning in public due to the amount of attention it attracts from bystanders. I recommend this book only as a refresher book or as a companion book.	2002-08-07
US	49059855	R1W8MU5RUUZBDV	0446353566	407259795	Working Smart: How to Accomplish More in Half the Time	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Doing more in less time and more; as promised.	This book is more then a time efficiency book but a how to book on managing all aspects of the office from scheduling and pructing meetings to effective communications. This is good starting and improving your SOHO (small office / home office) operations. It starts off each chapter discussing popular beliefs. I loved the chapter on \\"work tapes\\". People have different beliefs about work from being \\"good for you\\" to \\"the harder you work the more successful you are\\". The truth regarding discipline. The difference between being efficient and effective. Doing the right job (efficacy); doing the job right<br />(effective). Handing disruptions; papers; goal planning; the right way to use a TO DO list. The only problem is the material is dated to 1979. (Before email, teleconferencing and Intenet) My copy had a printing error on page 267 the publisher missed printed the pages and started over with page 33. Missed \\"efficient Communications\\") This continued for about 40 pages before picking up with last chapter of the book. Even though dated and with this defect I enjoyed the book. It's an easy read and I highly recommended it.	2002-07-28
US	49059855	R3VIWZ57ZKUJ11	0452266041	777032055	Speed Reading: Third Edition	Books	3	17	20	N	N	Dated  material with a few sprinkles of useful information	First, this book is in British English. This may bother those into spelling (ex: realise instead of realize) Starts with reasons for bad reading skills and even provides answers to obstacles a person may encounter in their quest to increase their reading speed. Provides very short chapters of between 2 to 10 pages covering a varity of subjects related to speed reading. Provides reading material for testing speed and comprehension. Goes unnessarily into the parts of the eye. Plugs his memory book on occasion. Very much into hand scanning. This is OK for starting but you would want to loose that habit since this attracts too much attention to what you're doing. I couldn't get into the scanning exercises since they were too short. I took about 40% of the info presented to heart. I especially liked the quote at the beginning of chapter 8. The human eye in theory should be able to read a page in 1/12 of a second. Extending this- a regular book in 6-25 seconds; an encyclepedia in one hour with comprehension. At least, I know what my maximum human limitations are. This book should be used with another speed reading book and not by itself.	2002-06-07

It takes practice to speed read just like running miles. Using the hand scan technique is good for starters but you would like to get away from that ASAP since it draws TOO much attention from others curious in what you're doing. It'll get you up to 2-3 times your original reading speed in 7 days. You'll need additional material to continue advancing like &quot;Mastering the Information Age&quot; by Michael J. McCarthy. My book is in threads from continued use.	2002-05-24

This book really helped me organize how I handle paperwork, communications, and information gathering. It help me learn to read faster and improve my memory. This book is out of print but I highly recommended it. This isn't Super Learning telling stories etc. This book really is a how to book. If you're swamped in paperwork this will help greatly. The book is any easy read.	2002-04-21

This book was a required for a college course I was taking. The book covers all avenues of computing including applications (Excel, animation, etc) This is a great beginner's book with everything you need in one book. The book is littered with web links that expanses further on the subject matter that can't be covered in the book due to space. Lots of detail on glossy sheets in full color. The only problems is that there is variable text size from \\"ant size\\" to large text. Reads like a magazine with too much detail in some area (hence the 4 stars) This could be a text book of the future. This book was done in 1997 so some of the sites may no longer be supported. [URL] is their home site. I would buy it again if I had to. They have a new edition yearly.	2002-04-21

Their disbandment after the war and their re-establishment by order of President Kennedy.  I liked the chapter of the book about the Bull Frog of the Pond. The longest serving SEAL is the Bull Frog. The name of the Bull Frog featured in that chapter looked familiar until I saw an episode of &quot;Survivor&quot;.  It's RUDY before he retired from the service and played the game!!!  Oh-Rah, Rudy!!!	2001-07-08

I started to read this book hoping to take a few skills with me as I plan my return to college. I remembered this book back when I was in high school  being recommend by my teachers. The authors labeled everything with an -ology and -pedia like hypnosopedia -hypnosis an sleep. There were so many words you had to take notes.  Story after story after story of how great this system is and only one chapter (7) that \\"showed\\" anything related to learning. I needed a score card to keep track of all the people. The key is to relax and use rhytum with yoga techniques to better absorb the facts. I walk away with unverifyible stories and wild claims. Its Great! Its Amazing! WHAT IS!?!? What do I need to do exactly to learn a language in 2 weeks FLUENTLY?? OK, they wrote this in 1979 so I went to their website ...and got more of the same. If you must read this book read chapter 7 and toss the rest. The rest of the book went into ESP, dreams telpathy etc. I recommend \\"Mastering the Information Age : A Course in Working Smarter, Thinking Better, and Learning Faster\\" by Michael J. McCarthy. It teaches you everything grokking, speed reading, meditation, communication without fluff, nutrition etc. It's out of print but a library should have it. A PBS \\"Nova\\" episode featured James Randi (randi.org) who went to Russia to investigate claims of \\"Charged water\\" and paranormal stuff funded by the government there. Each one he proved a fraud or a scam.  I think this is tre in this case. I did try some of the shorter exercise in ch 7 with so-so success (really a little worst since I study with no distractions TV etc.  What convinced me that this maybe snake oil was on page 23 when Dr. Georgi Lozanov did a sleep learning experiment and pull the speaker plugs on some of the students' material as they slept. The results: high scores. They anticipated the benefits they would receive and did very well. That's how good the system is. But they must have had the knowledge already to pass. Also Dr. Lozanov was too busy to use his own course!!!(Pg 37) They plug this as a positive because the system was so popular he had to give appearances. They would have fitted in well as Art Bell's guest!!  I believe there is no limits to human potential. That's why I read the book. I just don't believe they have the right method  and KNOW IT.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!s how good the system is. But they must have had the knowledge already to pass.
