In spite of using a translation I do not prefer, Martin's commentary is very good because he seeks to use the Gospel to challenge the reader with penetrating questions. Martin's commentary, like the Gospel itself, calls us to conversion. Instead of a dry academic commentary, Martin gives us a pastoral commentary that, at the same time, is scholarly in the best sense of the term. For example, he includes valuable historical and theological background information in various text boxes throughout the book. I will quibble with him on two matters only. First, he seems, to me at least, to push the envelope a bit too much in speculating about the limitations of Jesus' knowledge inherent in his human nature (see, for example, pp. 333, 359-60). Second, I flatly disagree with his analysis of Jesus' saying that in the resurrected life \\"they neither marry nor are given in marriage\\" in the pericope at Mark 12:18-27. Martin speculates that Jesus may mean \\"that there will be no new marriages in heaven, not that existing marriages will be dissolved\\" (p. 322). In my opinion, the plain meaning of the pericope is that the earthly marriages of the widow are in fact dissolved at death--none of the seven marriages becomes part of the risen life. This meaning is certainly consistent with the Catholic view that marriages are dissolved when either party dies. There may be at work here a lurking Western cultural \\"romanticism\\" in the commentary. Other than those two quibbles, I think all would greatly gain, as I did, from reading this spiritually challenging commentary.	2005-10-04

In this small book, you get the benefits of the insights of a first-rate scholar without having to plow through his much longer works (although the longer works are indeed worth plowing through with determination). Wright emphasizes two themes that we tend to forget. The first theme is that the Lord's Prayer is about asking God to transform this earth and our earthly desires, not about pie in the sky. Secondly, the Pater Noster is about our \\"signing on\\" to the Kingdom, a Kingdom full of unpredictable transformations and exoduses. Wright reminds us that in the Our Father we put our entire selves, with all our earthly desires and concerns, in the hands of the Father. The book is more than worth the small expenditure of time it takes to read it.	2005-08-29

Books	4	17	21	N	N	A Fresh Presentation of the Gospel	Although apparently targeted to teens and young adults, this small book offers a refreshing restatement of the Gospel challenge of forging a personal relationship with Jesus that older adults will find invigorating. Welborn obviously has the main qualification for any Catholic apologist: living the faith in daily prayer. Three themes stand out: 1.) her focus on Catholicism as a personal relationship with Jesus in and through His Church; 2.)the urgency of attending to Scripture, especially the Gospels; and 3.) restating John Paul the Great's theology of the body in understandable form. Welborn's book will remind you of your calling if you are older and will open your eyes if you have yet to grapple with Jesus. The only major suggestion for improvement I would offer Ms. Welborn is to focus even more on the importance of living in the Holy Spirit as the engine for the Christian life. On a much less important note, I would suggest she drop any works by Luke Timothy Johnson as a recommended source for her readers. Mr. Johnson is an outspoken critic of John Paul the Great's theology of the body. More importantly, Mr. Johnson mischaracterizes the Resurrection of Christ in his commentary on the New Testament. In my opinion, Luke Timothy Johnson is not a reliable Catholic source. Younger readers should not be directed to him as a \\"go-to\\" name.	2005-08-08

Sister Shields gives genuine insight into making this promise real in our lives. She points out that praying in Jesus' name means praying in accord with His will, His heart, His intentions. She also points out that frequent immersion in Scripture is crucial to so uniting ourselves with the plans of Jesus. This insight is just one example of many others in this small and worthwhile book. She also discusses the sacraments, the saints, praying in tongues or wordlessly, the rosary, and fasting as an aid to intercession. The book is strewn with absorbing stories of her own experiences and those of others. You will be happy to have read this book whose central theme is God's very personal love for each one of us.

Wright exposes the absurd concocted fantasies of three writers who in 1992 published works on Jesus. The common thread in all three writers is their willingness to invent fantastical portraits of Jesus with no basis in history or Scripture. In the process of his devastating critique of these bogus writers, Wright gives us telling theological insights, especially concerning the relation of first century Jewish monotheism and the emerging Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus and concerning the proper perspective with which to approach the question of the virginal conception of Jesus. In addition, Wright provides an initial chapter that gives the general reader an historical overview of Jesus scholarship and a final chapter that ties Wright's insights together. Reading this small book is like being treated to lunch or dinner with an insightful and witty professor who is generously willing to share his best insights.	2005-08-05

What Professor Woods does is open our eyes to show that the roots of the scientific revolution, of international law, of modern economic analysis, and of much else lay in the very Catholic Middle Ages and the scholasticism that it spawned. For example, we assume, especially as Americans, that the emphasis on the natural rights of man is due to figures such as John Locke and Thomas Jefferson; but Prof. Woods shows that it was the Spanish Scholastics of the sixteenth century who rejuvenated the idea of the natural rights of all human beings. Woods documents his work with extensive endnotes and a bibliography. Personally, I find his chapters on science, international law, and economics to be the most surprising. It is surely a paradigm shift to see so much of what is of value in Western civilization as firmly rooted in the Catholic world view. For further details about the Catholic achievements relating to international law and economics, see my blog link above.	2005-07-24

He refutes in page after page of documented facts the great and repeated lie that Pope Pius XII was sympathetic to the Nazis. The truth that emerges again and again from each documented fact is that Pius XII spoke out against Nazi racism both before and after he became pope, that Pius XII instructed papal diplomats to aid persecuted Jews in the occupied nations of Europe, that he contributed money to aid desperate Jews, that he opened Catholic facilities in the Vatican and in other parts of Rome and Italy to shelter thousands of Jews from the Nazis, and that he gave direct face-to-face orders to protect Jews from the Nazis. This book is so well documented that Pius's detractors have to either put up or shut up. In fact, the detractors should apologize and formally retract their slanders. Of the many outrageous slanders against Pius XII, one in particular stands out to show the level of distortion used by the haters of this Pope. Rabbi Dalin recounts how Pius hater John Cornwell even uses a misleading cover for his book Hitler's Pope that makes it seem to the uninformed reader that Pius, who was then the papal nuncio (ambassador) to Germany, is just exiting from a meeting with the Nazis when in fact the picture is from 1927, well before Hitler took power, and in fact shows the future Pius XII, in the course of his formal diplomatic duties, emerging from a diplomatic reception for the elected President of Germany in 1927 during the democratic and pre-Nazi Weimar Republic (pp. 62-63). The book reads quickly, gets to the point, and has copious footnotes and a convenient index. Rabbi Dalin has performed a righteous deed.

Why? Wright is a thorough, first-class scholar who goes back to the sources and back to the historical context. The key to his method is that, unlike so many disappointing, so-called biblical scholars, he instead seeks to discover what the biblical writers actually thought and intended, and not retroject post-modern Western views on the biblical writers. His conclusion in this now standard study of the Resurrection of Christ is that the biblical writers believed in a bodily resurrection as Christian orthodoxy has always affirmed, not in some ethereal, non-bodily survival after death that some \\"prestigious\\" scholars seek to promote. As a historian, he concludes that no alternative belief other than the genuinely bodily resurrection of Christ explains the content and belief-system of the New Testament and the rise of Christianity after Christ's death (see Chapter 18). And he makes the historical case that such a belief could have arisen only if this event, the bodily resurrection of Christ, really occurred. Read the book, take your time, read even the footnotes, and you will get a graduate education in biblical theology for the price of this book. You will be light years ahead of many so-called theologians and biblical scholars. The book has 738 pages of text; but Wright, thankfully, has summaries scattered throughout to help you see the big picture. I would recommend beginning by reading the first chapter and chapter 18 and then reading the summaries or conclusions at the end of each of the chapters in between. Then I would go to Wright's chapter seven where he discusses the key passages on resurrection in 1 Corinthians. Then, go back to chapter 2 and start reading through the book methodically, taking your time, for as long as it takes. It will not be a waste of time. In the end, you will agree with Wright's last line, borrowing from St. Paul in 1 Cor. 15:58b, that \\"in the Lord our labour is not in vain.\\" Your faith will be decisively confirmed.t.

It is a book that any parent, any single, any grandparent, and any educator should have. And certainly pastors should read it and preach it. The book is specific and answers specifically the age-old question of how much physical contact is prudent in a Christian courtship (of course, no sex, but even restraint in kissing). Fr. Morrow advocates a two-stage process: first non-exclusive friendship dating with no kissing or even hand-holding, only nice hugs. If the two \\"friends\\" find that they have a mutual interest in exploring the possibility of marriage, they then agree to enter the courtship period where gentle and restrained kissing and hand-holding are allowed. The goal is to create and deepen personal intimacy and not short circuit the growth of genuine friendship with inappropriate physical intimacy. Certainly, many of us who are now married wish we would have had this type of book in hand years ago. It would have saved many a lot of needless confusion and trouble.

The first part of the book gives us a sense of the background and values of the new Pope based on the Pope's past writings and interviews and based on Moynihan's own repeated conversations with Benedict when he was a cardinal. The second part is a topical collection of the Pope's views on many issues ranging from various theological dogmas to matters of morality to issues in the Christian life such as suffering and loneliness. The third and last part of the book consists of a reprinting of the first messages and homily of the new Pope from that extraordinary month of April 2005. You will get a good sense about the new Pope's vision from this book.

For example, you will never think of the sacrament of Baptism in the same way again when you focus on the baptismal font as representative of the womb of Mary so that Mary is indeed our Mother as she was the Mother of Christ. You will also see the Marian character of evangelization in which we as Christians become \\"other Marys\\" as we give birth to new Christians. All of these insights come from the early Church Fathers as they prayed over the Scriptures and communicated their deep faith to their listeners. Fr. Hugo Rahner (not to be confused with his controversial brother Karl Rahner) originally published this small book in 1961, just before Vatican II. The book reflects the movement for ressourcement or a \\"return to the sources\\" that was at the heart of Vatican II. In this book, Hugo Rahner returns to the Scriptures as seen through the eyes of the early Church Fathers who were very Marian.	2005-06-26

John Paul the Great calls us instead to return to the \\"realism\\" of the tradition of Aristotle and Aquinas in which being takes center stage. As the media has noted, JPG draws a parallel between the Nazi holocaust and legal abortion later in the book. He bases his prophetic point on Aquinas' teaching that an unjust law is no law. Just as Hitler's regime was illegitimate, although freely elected, so is the abortion regime imposed today by freely elected legislatures. A good portion of the book then considers the history of Europe in general and Poland in particular and emphasizes the decisive role of the Gospel in the formation of European culture and sees this same role manifesting itself in other cultures. As a Catholic, I was struck by the late Pope's tying of the word \\"memory\\" in the title to the Eucharist: Christ gives us our identity through the \\"memory\\" enacted in the Eucharist. And so memory is the key to identity. For Catholics, the Eucharist is that key, because it shows us that Christ, as John Paul was fond of saying, is the answer to the dramatic question that each human life is and always will be. John Paul the Great has been faithful to this Christocentric message to the end with the publication of his last book.	2005-05-06

Books	5	31	40	N	Y	Cuts Through the Muddle	I have yet to be disappointed in the work of N.T. Wright, whether it is his gigantic book on the Resurrection of Christ or his joint book with Stephen Neill on the history of New Testament scholarship. Wright comes through again in this smaller book. What is most striking--because it is so simple and elegant--is that Wright's common sense adherence to the Pauline texts is what enables him to escape the absurdities of so many other Pauline scholars. Wright fortunately makes clear what many an ordinary Christian would affirm in the face of generations of scholarly confusion: we are not saved by the doctrine of \\"justification\\" but rather by Jesus Christ who died for us and rose again. Wright demolishes the great Lutheran cul-de-sac of \\"justification\\" as the way Christians are saved. Instead, Wright argues that \\"justification\\" is more about ecclesiology, that is, about the community that results after we are saved by Messiah Jesus (see pp. 122,133). Remarkably, Wright's reworking of the much abused notions of \\"justification\\" and \\"righteousness,\\" reminds me of the insightful and passionate writings of Fr. Rainero Cantalamessa, the current preacher to the papal household, even though it must be said that their approaches do differ (see p. 164). It seems to me that Luther dropped the ball on justification. We are still recovering from the effects of that grand and highly influential diversion from Paul's real focus.	2005-02-16

Barclay goes back to the original Greek word behind each of the 15 works of the flesh (from immorality to drunkenness) and behind each of the fruits of the Spirit (from agape to self-control). He looks at the way the pagan Greeks used each word, at the way the word is used in the Greek Old Testament (the Septuagint or \\"LXX\\"), and, of course, at the way the word is used in the New Testament.

The end is not merely to obey commandments but rather to obey commandments in order to be truly happy. The power to walk that path of obedience comes not from dry logic but from the gifts of the Holy Spirit that animate the virtues of a Christian. Most telling is Pinckaers' distinction between mere pleasure and joy as two radically different conceptions of happiness. Many of our life-changing moral decisions come down to the choice between transient, superficial pleasure that is illusory and ends in bitterness and even hatred, while true happiness is, in the words of Augustine, \\"joy born of the truth\\" (p. 77).

Apparently, the Kerry campaign has also corrected Kerry's prior version of how many boats fled when the famous Jim Rassmann was rescued. These changes in Kerry's accounts lend credibility to the book's other allegations.<br /><br />Third, the accusers are risking their reputations in this book by attacking Kerry's war service in the first part of the book.

He correctly states the basis of the Church's inability to ordain women and is quite persuasive in pointing out that the modern Western view that an individual has a right to ordination is utterly off-base (p. 55). He also cogently explains the basis of the Church ban on contraception by lucidly noting how those in favor of contraception labor under the assumption that there is an \\"inalienable right\\" to sexual activity (p. 113). These are only two of the many issues discussed in the book, but these two show that Fr. McCoy is intent on explaining Catholic teaching and not on revising it as so many books penned by theological liberals do.<br />The best part of the book, in my view, is McCoy's discussion of the \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" (pride, sloth, envy, avarice, gluttony, wrath, and lust). He discusses them through a masterful presentation of Christian anthropology--the Christian view of the flourishing human person. He shows how the seven deadly sins are related and how they impoverish our existence. He shows how these sins are very much alive today and do not just form an archaic list from another age.<br />Here is Catholicism truly presented in an intelligent manner. This book would truly be a valuable addition to anyone's library.	2004-07-01

The book is personally inspiring because Reagan himself had his tough times: an alcoholic father, a broken engagement early on, a terrible death threat from Hollywood Communists, losing an infant child, an unexpected divorce, a disappointing movie career, and a tough loss to Gerald Ford for the 1976 Republican nomination. And yet throughout all of this, Reagan maintained his sense of destiny rooted in trust that, by God's providence, all would in the end turn out for the better. And it did.<br />On a more political level, the book has a chapter that captures a coalition that came into its own under Reagan and may very well decide the current presidential election: the coalition of evangelical Protestants and conservative Catholics. The Republican Party of today is unimaginable without that coalition. And all of that is owed to Ronald Reagan who, as the book points out, was uniquely situated to foster this new coalition, given his background with a Catholic father and an evangelical Protestant mother.<br />The book captures what is most important about Reagan, and for that it is well worth the price.	2004-06-22

They have also ignored the New Testament evidence for the primacy of Peter as first bishop of Rome and for the priesthood of the New Covenant. Fortunately, Cardinal Ratzinger sets the record straight by showing that there is no opposition between the kingdom preached by Jesus and the Church founded by the same Jesus, by documenting the New Testament evidence for the Petrine primacy, and by pointing to the theology of the New Covenant's own priesthood present in the New Testament. All of this is done concisely, precisely, and clearly. This book should be read by any Christian interested in the Church and especially by Catholics. It is a primer on ecclesiology.	2004-06-16

In this small book, which is a collection of past homilies and addresses on the Eucharist, Ratzinger discusses the Eucharist from many perspectives. For Catholics, the Eucharist is the &quot;heart of life,&quot; as the book's subtitle states. So to deepen knowledge of the Eucharist is life-changing. For Protestants, there is no better way to see the Catholic difference, a Catholic difference shared with the Eastern Orthodox.<br />You can see the Catholic difference in this excerpt: &quot;The church is not just a space in which something sometimes happens early in the morning, while for the rest of the day it stands empty, 'unused'. There is always the 'Church' in the church building, because the Lord is always giving himself, because the eucharistic mystery remains present . . . .&quot; (p. 89). This excerpt is from the address entitled &quot;The Presence of the Lord in the Sacrament,&quot; which, in my view, is the most compelling of all the addresses in the book.	2004-06-04

He writes with a precision that is alien to the written works most Americans have been exposed to. He clarifies with sophistication the Catholic belief in the Real Presence by focusing on sacramentality, avoiding the oversimplistic fashion in which the Real Presence is often talked about. In my opinion, the most compelling chapters are 20 (&quot;Man's Share in the Eucharistic Sacrifice&quot;), 21 (&quot;The Eucharistic Liturgy&quot;), 22 (&quot;The Eucharistic Banquet&quot;), which could stand alone as independent essays. At one point, Abbot Vonier makes a compelling call to become a people of the Eucharist: &quot;If this mystery becomes the constant preoccupation of human society, its daily deed, its chief concern, its highest aspiration, then society is saved&quot; (p. 169). We would become eucharistic people constantly in a state of gratitude to our Creator.	2004-05-31

Also striking is Kreeft's analysis of the suggestion that prayer is a waste of time by pointing out that through prayer God will instead multiply our time (p. 124). As usual with Kreeft, the book is full of gems of insight that will strike readers in different personal circumstances with varying levels of significance. That is as it should be.

He assertively affirms the Catholic sexual ethic in which self-gift and service replace using others.

This book is a magnificent Magna Carta of our freedom to be authentically Catholic without first checking with the guardians of political correctness.

The end result is not the fictional &quot;folk&quot; Catholicism of Andrew Greeley in which being Catholic becomes less a religion and more an ethnic/cultural identity, but rather a realistic appraisal and description of the crisis within the Catholic Church in the United States.<br />While Greeley basis his Catholic identity on a love for warm and fuzzy Catholic &quot;stories&quot;-- without making clear how many, if any, of the stories he views as historically true--Varacalli provides a prescription for re-evangelizing American culture with unequivocal Catholic truth. Varacalli's book helps to rehabilitate a sociology of Catholicism which too often has degenerated into vapid and imprecise liberal musings.	2003-12-24

This book is well worth reading because Ratzinger obviously places proclaiming the truth above his personal popularity. In my opinion, his most striking words have to do with the proper role of the bishop: to keep challenging Christians and others, to, as Augustine said, keep them from falling asleep. Ratzinger finds repulsive the mentality of &quot;don't rock the boat&quot; that seems to permeate too many dioceses. When church historians look back to the latter part of the 20th century, they will rightly note the pivotal role of Ratzinger in preserving the deposit of faith when so many high-ranking clerics and prominent theologians were so eager to compromise that same deposit of faith.	2003-12-18

What we see in de Lubac is a great and punctilious scholar, a man of the Church, and a man of deep humility, a combination rare in the world of scholars. This book is a welcome introduction to the deeply influential theological vision of de Lubac who opens up for us a truly wide Catholic vision of revelation.	2003-09-30

It is a wonderful collection of essays, with my personal favorite being the incisive and crisp essay by the late British philosopher G.E.M. Anscombe (a woman, by the way) who cuts with brilliance through much of the muddled thinking about birth control. Another outstanding essay is by John Crosby on the philosophical personalism of John Paul II. In addition, included is a translation of the encyclical itself by Janet Smith based on the official Latin text.<br />The prophetic nature of the Church's teaching against contraception is seen in the current approval by some liberal Christians of the gay lifestyle. This outcome is not surprising because once the ban on contraception is rejected, there is no logical basis for objecting to nonprocreative homosexual acts. Even the liberal Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who favors actively gay clergy, is on record as admitting that the embrace of contraception logically and eventually leads to the approval of the gay lifestyle.<br />Thus, the defenders of Humanae Vitae have been shown to be right. The Church's ban on contraception is central to Christian sexual morality. That is why the essays collected in this book are more important today than ever before.	2003-08-31

The predominant lesson of the book is that readers of the works of New Testament scholars should be wary of the unproven assumptions and ideologies that animate much of this scholarly work, especially work emerging from the German milieu, including that of the still influential Rudolph Bultmann. Although Neill generously affirms that there is much to learn even from the work of flawed biblical criticism, he does not hesitate to point out the baseless and unproven assumptions that permeate much of the history of historical-critical biblical interpretation. Both the general reader and the specialized student will gain from the common sense advice of this genial lover of the New Testament. Especially valuable is the last chapter extensively updated by Tom Wright, who is now also an Anglican bishop in England. Wright has recently written a major work affirming the traditional Christian belief in the bodily resurrection of Christ. Both Neill and Wright bring a commitment to being true to the evidence that is unfortunately missing from a lot of what passes as critical biblical scholarship.	2003-08-29

He concludes that such ordination is contrary to Scripture and Tradition. This book was written before the Pope's declaration in 1994 that the Church had no authority to ordain women. Hauke's work provides  scholarly support for that papal declaration. The first half of the book gives extensive background on the philosophical and theological dimensions in different world religions of the masculine and the feminine. Only after setting forth this detailed background does Hauke give his detailed discussion of the Catholic view. In my opinion, his most significant insight concerns his exegesis of St. Paul's ban against women speaking in church in 1 Corinthians 14. Hauke concludes that this ban is aimed not at speaking in general during the liturgy, but at engaging in official public instruction during the liturgy. Hauke points out that Paul characterizes this ban as an authoritative &quot;command of the Lord.&quot; Hauke reasonably infers that this ban on women engaging in formal instruction in the divine liturgy necessarily points to the non-ordination of women given that this type of public liturgical instruction is precisely a major function of the ordained.<br />Even more persuasive, in my view, is Hauke's analysis of those medieval theologians who focused on the Incarnation of Christ as a male as an underpinning for the ban on women's ordination. Hauke shows that the Tradition against women priests is, ultimately, not based on assumptions of inferiority or on some sort of patriarchal oppression, but rather is based on a deeply rooted and scriptural theology of complementarity which views the feminine as fundamentally receptive and the male as fundamentally transcendent. In my opinion, no supporter of women's ordination who fails to address and respond to Hauke's detailed scholarly study can be taken seriously.ously.	2003-08-29

In this small book, he shows us the crucial role of Mary for all Christians as the one who defines what the Church is and the one who directs us to Jesus. For Christians to understand their circumstances as individuals and as Church, Mary is essential as the model of the first disciple. Balthasar captures her singular role when he quotes her words in the Gospel: &quot;'Do whatever he tells you.' Perhaps nowhere is Mary's whole cast of mind more present than in this saying&quot; (p. 63). All Christians should listen.	2003-08-16

Dr. Williamson fortunately has distilled the principles of Catholic biblical interpretation in his study of the Pontifical Biblical Commission's 1993 document \\"The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church.\\" The authoritative and approving preface is by Albert Vanhoye, S.J., Secretary of the Biblical Commission, a biblical scholar in his own right. Williamson conveniently summarizes the twenty principles for Catholic biblical interpretation that he distills from this official Church document in an appendix. He also includes a welcome glossary of terms. Thus, the book is accessible by non-specialists. And that in the end is, in my opinion, the most significant point made by the book: that the Bible belongs to the entire believing community. Contrary to what we see on the shelves of bookstores, the Scriptures are not merely the playthings of specialized scholars, some of whom disdain the very idea of divine intervention in human history. As Williamson points out in his Principle No. 7: \\"The Scriptures belong to the entire Church . . . and all of the members of the Church have a role in the interpretation of Scripture\\" (Appendix). This book will help you take up that role knowledgeably and responsibly. It will be of aid to both Catholic and non-Catholics.	2003-07-23

Likewise, Wilken's success in exploring the thought of early Christian writers is due to his being a part of the believing community of Christians. Because of his own belief, Wilken is able to zero in on the heart of what these early Christian writers are trying to communicate. A common faith creates a sympathy between scholar and ancient writer that is essential to successful interpretation. Three examples come to mind. The first is Wilken's discussion of the virtues, especially the virtue of patience (pp. 283-285). The second is his grasp of the Christian sense of the radical novelty of the Incarnation: that God became man in very particular and mundane circumstances (a view which in my opinion supports the Catholic insistence that the all-male priesthood is an essential witness to the maleness of Jesus). Finally, Wilken cites his own experience in training lectors for the worshipping community as confirming the insights he gathers from his study of Origen and Augustine (p. 182). Because of the bond of empathy between scholar and material, the reader will gain from Wilken's work.	2003-07-18

In this short book, Balthasar fields questions posed in an interview by an Italian friend. While Balthasar has bequeathed us an extensive legacy of theological writings, this interview provides the reader with an enticing look at the mindset and fundamental orientation that motivates his theological perspective. In the course of the interview, Balthasar chastizes the declining religious orders, praises the new ecclesial movements, bluntly exposes the pretense of confused Catholic theologians, and emphasizes the importance of the papacy and the avoidance of an &quot;anti-Roman attitude.&quot; Readers will not regret this introduction to the work of a great Christian and theologian.	2003-07-04

As a former philosophy student who spent a semester on Heidegger's supposed masterpiece Being and Time (Sein und Zeit), I do not share that assessment of Heidegger. Strathern rightly raises the fundamental question whether the jargon or verbiage of Heidegger is meaningful at all (p. 33). My own personal conclusion matches that of the psychologist Jung who referred to Heidegger as the \\"master of complicated banalities\\" (p. 75). Only in a nihilistic world that has lost all faith in logical and clear thinking as a way to the truth can the absurd verbiage of Heidegger be hailed as a philosophical advance.<br />Strathern also rightly raises the active and eager Nazism of Heidegger in the thirties that was indeed related to his philosophical ideas (p.62), although Strathern chivalrously tries to salvage the pure core of Heidegger's ideas from Nazi affinity. Finally, Strathern does not shrink back from recounting the failure of integrity and character seen in Heidegger's turning his back on his Jewish philosophical mentor Husserl during the Nazi era (p. 60) and from recounting the deception involved in Heidegger's lengthy adulterous relation with his much younger student Hannah Arendt (pp. 35-40).	2003-06-01

Contrary to conventional liberal thinking in the West, traditional and theologically conservative Christianity is booming in the Third World, while Islam is also growing. Jenkins points out that the assumption that Islam will overtake Christianity in the Third World is baseless. He rightly urges Westerners to drop their parochialism and recognize that one of the most powerful forces on the world stage is booming and expanding Third World Christianity. Jenkins' book is an excellent guide to a future in which religious conflict will become more important on the world stage as Third World Christians challenge Moslem persecution.

The pressures of cultural correctness did not keep him from presenting the whole truth of Catholic teaching. Unlike other writers, he did not engage in artful ambiguity about some of the teachings of the Church.<br />In the Pocket Catholic Dictionary, he manages to provide insights in a small abridged dictionary that others can't or won't communicate in much larger works. One example from my own research will illustrate the value of Fr. Hardon's pocket dictionary as a jumping off point for further research.<br />In researching the canon law issue of whether contraceptive intercourse was sufficient to consummate a marriage, I found several specialized reference sources and commentaries full of ambiguity and even one that was ideologically slanted in its presentation. For Catholics, this particular issue of canon law is important because a marriage becomes indissoluble only after consummation. One of the few sources that addressed the issue forthrightly was Fr. Hardon's Pocket Dictionary and related works, while other lengthy reference works specializing in canon law were of no help. Without mincing words, Fr. Hardon states in his definition of \\"Consummated Marriage\\" that \\"contraceptive intercourse does not consummate Christian marriage.\\"<br />Thus, on an issue of great importance to Catholics, this small pocket dictionary opened up an avenue for further research where larger and more specialized works failed to enlighten. I am sure there are other issues out there for which Fr. Hardon's Pocket Catholic Dictionary would turn out to be a good and reliable  starting point.	2003-05-21

In a world where many academics are allergic to democracy, Lewis' call for a democratic Middle East is refreshing. The book focuses, as the subtitle indicates, on the clash of Islam and modernity. Yet, on this central issue, the analysis is in my view superficial. Any analysis of Islam's reaction to modernity must ipso facto be theological. We are dealing with a theological phenomenon. A good successor to this book would consider how Christianity was able to assimilate its Jewish heritage, while Islam continues to view both Judaism and Christianity as corruptions. That theological comparison will reveal more about Islam's clash with modernity, than will an exclusively secular analysis.	2003-05-06

His historical analysis of the liturgical movement uncovers how the roots of much misguided liturgical &quot;reform&quot; lie in Enlightenment assumptions at variance with Christian and Catholic belief. In Nichols' words, the Enlightenment has bequeathed to us modern liturgists whose work is &quot;[a]nthropocentric, moralizing, voluntaristic, didactic, subjectivist&quot; in contrast to the authentic theocentric nature of the liturgy (pp. 28-29).

As I understand it, a new edition is now available from the publisher that is even easier to use that this particular edition because all readings for a particular day are printed in one place without the need to follow a cross reference to another page. In whatever edition you use, the value of this missal is that it contains all readings for all days in one volume, as opposed to multi-volume missals with one volume for Sundays and another for weekdays. Even better, the missal includes some Latin texts for each day that are sometimes clearly superior to their English translations for those who can make out the Latin. This missal is traditional and devotional in the best sense. The high quality should not be surprising since the editor is associated with Opus Dei (Midwest Theological Forum). As other reviews on this site indicate, the older 4th ed. from 1998 uses the translations of the Jerusalem Bible which do not match those used in the readings at an actual Mass, which use the New American Bible. But for home use the older edition is quite satisfactory. For those seeking an edition to match the Scriptures read at Mass, it is better to purchase the newer version that uses the Revised New American Bible translation. (Note: the newer version is not the one displayed on this site.)	2003-04-18

Brown's chapters are relatively short and thus make reading this long book pleasurable because you can make identifiable progress in your reading. Brown also has copious citations to the works of Augustine for those who wish to track down a quote. In addition, he has added an epilogue that actually corrects the flawed judgments he made in the first edition over thirty years ago (this is a humility rare in academic circles). The epilogue also has a chapter on new writings of Augustine that scholars have uncovered since the first edition of his work. My only wish would have been for more theological exploration of the theme of predestination which is presented in a superficial manner. As a Catholic, I would also have preferred more explicit exploration of Augustine's relations with the popes of his time. But, all in all, Brown has written and updated a great biography that deserves its stature as the definitive biography of Augustine. I heartily recommend it.	2003-03-20

He documents the bias that permeates a media that puts cultural correctness over truthful analysis. He has been on the inside and what he documents is a bias that is utterly unprofessional. The professional journalist should provide facts wherever they may lead even if they offend the people they socialize with and admire. Fortunately, we live in a competitive and free market economy where alternate sources of analysis, taking advantage of new technology such as cable television and the internet, are undermining the monopoly power over information of the major television networks. Goldberg's exposure is an implicit endorsement of the value of a competitive economy that provides such alternatives.	2003-03-07

In the preface, he notes with satisfaction that the Catechism has been enthusiastically adopted by the Christian public although some establishment academics hold it askance. In this book, he assists those eager to embrace the Catechism with his accessible commentary on various aspects of the Catechism. In my view, the most significant chapter deals with the &quot;biblical realism&quot; of the Catechism which treats the Jesus of the Gospels as the real Jesus, in contrast to the absurd reconstructions of idle professors who peddle their fictions as the so-called &quot;historical Jesus.&quot; He also has a chapter on the relation of Judaism and Christianity which is in welcome contrast to the recent defective and mediocre reflection on the issue by a group associated with the U.S. Bishops' conference. We are fortunate to have the quality work of a distinguished theologian like Cardinal Ratzinger when we are deluged by so much mediocrity from academia.	2003-01-06

Randolph has written a highly useful work for Catholics who regularly use the sacrament of penance and for those Catholics who are coming back to the sacrament after much neglect. He provides topical advice relevant for today's society. For example, he gives guidance on the common situation in which people realize years later that their prior lifestyle was in fact gravely sinful. His recommendation is that, in spite of their lack of knowledge, they should still bring these sins to confession. This situation in which many people can actually be ignorant of gravely sinful conduct, especially sexual conduct, is common today among younger generations because the wider society now accepts as normal what the Christian moral tradition has always viewed as seriously wrong. This particular situation is but one example of the instances where Fr. Randolph gives needed advice for today's Catholic. When so many pulpits are unfortunately silent on the need for the regular use of this sacrament, Fr. Randolph has written a guide that is sorely needed in order to renew the role of this sacrament in the Church.	2003-01-04

The good news is that from all this unnecessary suffering and cultural mediocrity a significant portion of the new generation is turning to traditional religious faith as a way of embracing an abundant and meaningful life. Colleen Carroll documents this welcome trend with statistics, interviews, and her own observations. Her work illustrates an ironic turn of events in which the aging rebels of liberalism decry the orthodoxy of the young. But in truth the aging sixties liberals were never really rebels: they were just succumbing to the age-old decadence of the privileged. The true rebels in any era are those who reject the dehumanizing use of sexuality and other forms of addictive behavior to pursue selfish gratification. The young people surveyed in this book  have suffered the consequences of these destructive choices and have had enough sense to come out of the rain. The author's dedication to documenting this immense story of courage and renewal has resulted in an inspiring parable of faith well worth reading.	2003-01-03

One example will illustrate how his approach sheds light on usually intractable and emotional issues. On the issue of priestly ordination of women, Weigel cogently points out that before getting into mutual recriminations, people should first consider the Catholic view of the ordained priesthood. It is not viewed as just another job or as just being a mere delegate of an assembly of Catholics. The priest is an icon of Christ who represents Christ the Bridegroom in his ministry to the laity. In Catholic understanding, the ordained priesthood is primarily sacramental, not functional. To fulfill that iconic and sacramental role, the Church reserves ordination to males.<br />By elucidating controversial issues in this manner, Weigel sheds light that can expose the unexamined assumptions that usually make useful discussion impossible.	2002-12-28

The matter or material used in each sacrament, whether water in Baptism or wheat bread and grape wine in the Eucharist, matters because it originates in divine choice. Lang shows how that divine choice fits into the long panorama of salvation history recorded in the Scriptures. Lang also relies on philosophical argument to show how particular matter makes a difference. This reasoning also applies to the issue of priestly ordination of women because the proper matter for the sacrament of holy orders is a male candidate. Lang's work illustrates the Catholic view that God works through particular forms of matter and so makes the choice of matter significant. Lang's arguments counteract the New Gnosticism prevalent in modern Western culture that views distinctions between different types of matter as unimportant. It is worth reading because it exposes how the desire of some to arbitrarily change the sacraments contradicts both divine revelation and human reasoning.	2002-12-23

He does so by giving us clues from philosophy, the arts, and the Bible to the meaning of suffering. As a Catholic Christian, Kreeft finds the ultimate meaning of suffering in the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. It is a book worth reading and re-reading. In my view, his most striking insight is how in literature, including the biblical story of Job, the protagonist must undergo suffering before the final triumph of good over evil. He urges us to view ourselves as protagonists in the midst of our own life stories. If good finally triumphs, as Christians believe, then the story is worthwhile, even with its inevitable suffering. Like a true philosopher, he also includes a thought-provoking chapter on why modernity can't understand suffering. This is a book that will appeal to all Christians, Catholic or non-Catholic, and to all persons searching to understand the meaning of suffering.	2002-10-07

In the past, he has even written ambiguously about the central Christian teaching concerning the bodily resurrection of Christ. His vision of a future Catholic Church includes ordination of women, a merely honorific papacy, and rejection of much of traditional Catholic devotion.

But I will pick one significant issue to make my point that the general reader should be very careful in relying on Mr. Wills' version of the Church's history.<br />In an effort to undercut the traditional Catholic view of papal origins, Mr. Wills insists that the Apostle Peter was not the first bishop of Rome. He states flatly, with what appears to be ironclad certainty, that there were no bishops of Rome until well into the second century A.D. Yet, contrary to Wills' insistence, there is indeed a reasonable and persuasive basis for viewing Peter as the founding bishop of the Church in Rome.<br />What Wills fails to mention to the general reader is that the Greek word translated as bishop, episkopos or overseer, appears several times in the New Testament itself. In the Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy 3:1,2; Titus 1:7), episkopos is prominently used to refer to local church leaders. In addition, there exists a letter written around 95 A.D. by St. Clement of Rome, on behalf of the Church at Rome to the Church at Corinth, which also refers to overseers or bishops (1 Clement XLIII.4 & XLIV.1). The Didache (or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles) is another early Christian document that many believe dates from the first century. It also refers to bishops.<br />The fact that the term \\"bishop\\" was thus in early circulation as signifying church leadership and oversight, plus the generally accepted fact that Peter was indeed active in and martyred in Rome provide a sure foundation for asserting that the Apostle Peter was considered a bishop while active in Rome. And even if, as many critical scholars speculate (though not without some challenge), the title bishop might have been applied to several church leaders simultaneously in Rome, it is reasonable to conclude that Peter as leader of the Apostles would have been considered the preeminent overseer or bishop while he was active among the Roman Christians, due to his indisputable leadership role in the New Testament and his personal connection to Jesus' earthly ministry. (In a way, modern American Catholics can relate to such a situation since many American dioceses have several bishops who assist the bishop holding ultimate authority in the diocese.) Thus, contrary to the impression given by Mr. Wills, there is a strong case to be made for viewing Peter as the founding bishop of the Church in Rome due to his preeminence while working in Rome. In fact, this view is precisely what early Church tradition holds.<br />A better, more objective historical source than Mr. Wills for those interested in early church history is the first volume of the Penguin History of the Church entitled The Early Church by Oxford and Cambridge scholar Henry Chadwick, especially chapter 2 (pp. 45-49) of the revised edition (1993). His treatment of the early emergence of bishops is consistent with the argument I set forth above.<br />The foregoing detail is necessary because Mr. Wills' presentation of his own view as an ironclad certainty is unfair to the general reader who will likely not research the question independently. So a warning to the wise: beware of tabloid history written for a special agenda.leadership role in the New Testament and his personal connection to Jesus' earthly ministry.

But the analysis in the book is uneven in quality due to instances of liberal bias. Most disturbing is the omission of relevant information that might detract from cardinals that the author chooses to view as \\"liberals\\" or \\"reformers.\\" Another problem is the apparent inclusion of some cardinals as frontrunners because they are perceived as potentially sharing the author's liberal agenda. There is also the unexplained exclusion of prominent conservative Cardinal Ratzinger from the list of top contenders. In March 2002, the author wrote that neither Ratzinger nor liberal Cardinal Martini would be elected pope because they were too divisive. Yet, in this book the author includes Martini in the list of top contenders, but excludes Ratzinger without explanation. Consistent with my analysis above are the comments of NBC Vatican affairs consultant George Weigel who found \\"fully half\\" of Allen's top contenders to be \\"utterly implausible,\\" and who also found the biographical portraits of the other cardinals to be \\"strangely awry at numerous points.\\"<br />Moreover, in a recent column, Allen admits to including a particular candidate in his list of top contenders \\"not so much because . . . he's a realistic front-runner\\" but because Allen personally admires this particular cardinal (Column, Oct. 22, 2002). So much for an objective list of realistic front-runners. The purported front-runner list appears to be more spin than fact. In addition, Allen himself has since noted that one cardinal informed him of a series of errors in the book. So, if the intent of the book is to somehow influence the deliberations of cardinals in the next conclave, the book's widely noted defects have reduced the likelihood of any such role.	2002-07-02

It is well-written and calmly sets forth the case for a contrived vocations shortage due to a feminist and gay agenda in too many seminaries. The book is believable and persuasive. Its rhetoric is restrained. As Fr. Neuhaus of First Things(June/July 2002) has said, \\"even if the situation in vocation offices and seminaries is only half as bad as he suggests, it is very bad indeed\\" (p. 78). Those who would criticize its methodology and some of its anecdotes should ask themselves why they did not put their own knowledge to good use and write this long overdue book themselves as a needed service to the Church. Such critics engage in overkill by straining at a gnat but swallowing a camel. Michael Rose deserves praise and gratitude for undertaking a thankless task that too many of us did not care to pursue. Its flaws should not overshadow its prophetic message.	2002-06-23
