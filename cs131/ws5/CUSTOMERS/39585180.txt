She seems to have the same answer for everybody. Her last appearance on Larry King Live was a flop. This was a few months ago; a caller had phoned in and asked about his troubled relationship with his mother, and Sylvia said now that Mom was on the other side, there is no hostility. The caller said \\"you mean you are telling me my mother has died?\\" and Sylvia said yes. Then the caller said \\"Well I'll get back to you after I CALL her!\\".<br />In one of her last books, \\"Visits From The Afterlife\\" she wrote a chapter on Elizabeth Short, who was known as the Black Dahlia, yet she does not solve the case for us. I feel she teases and tiptoes around the mystery, and her saying \\"take what you want and leave the rest\\" is more like saying \\"only what you want to believe is true\\".<br />Many of her public predictions that I have heard, have never come true; according to her, breast cancer should have been a \\"thing of the past\\" in 2000. On one episode of Montel a few years back, she said that John Travolta should stay away from flying planes in March. Well, that isn't really a \\"prediction\\".<br />I am giving three stars because though I doubt her credibility, her heart is in the right place when she talks about how EVERYONE is accepted to \\"the Other Side\\" (if there is one) and she continues to tell people that there is no such thing as \\"hell\\", that it is only a scare-tactic to get people to behave.	2004-07-15

That could have easily been done one-on-one, or with a professional mediator. Phone calls. -Not through a tell-all book given to Bette on Mother's Day! I read this forgettable book about ten years ago and I don't remember a word of it. It didn't stick with me or have any important impact or message like Christina Crawford's autobiography \\"Mommie Dearest\\" that actually had a point. Her's was not written out of revenge, she had a legitimate story. Will celebrity children please stop jumping on the Mommie Dearest bandwagon? Probably not. They earn a lot of money and we all want to know what *really* happened behind closed doors. But \\"My Mother's Keeper\\" falls flat.	2004-07-14

A lot of this book was devoted to personal stories of other people I don't know and I could not relate to their particular circumstances. I was hoping more for tips and exercises that I could use myself every day. It was interesting that the author boils down your &quot;insecurity&quot; or &quot;obsessiveness&quot; to how you were raised as a child and your relationship as a child with your parents.

I would recommend finding this book that way. This was a good book but probably not one you would read over and over. Not much new information here that wasn't told in Bob Thomas's book. New pictures though, and those are always nice. I appreciated how the author did not make any attempt to discredit Christina Crawford, and this book was a fair look into Joan's life. Guiles reflects on some situations from &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; that he claims are inaccurate, but I don't believe them. He writes that Christina says Joan pulled her out of Chadwick and then told people she had been expelled. But Guiles says that school wasn't even in session then. Yeah, what's new? Christina does say that school was indeed not in session when that happened, and was kept there as a punishment. So that wasn't an inaccuracy on her part.<br />This was a good book and if you are very interested in it you could probably finish it in one day.	2004-04-02

I went to pick this up at the bookstore because I was hoping to read about my astrological compatibility between some friends and co-workers. Instead of being just the sun signs, there were moon ascendants, the &quot;houses&quot; or whatever, and to use this book correctly you would need the exact day and time the other person was born. Most of us don't know that, so this book is useless. There were also many diagrams that looked so difficult and overwhelming, so I left this one on the shelf. &quot;Love Signs&quot; was much easier to understand.	2004-01-27

What an amazing story. It should still be in print, as people still talk about Frances Farmer. I liked this even better than &quot;Will There Really Be A Morning&quot; because it went deeper into her life, and more accurately, since the &quot;autobiography&quot; was in fact written by Frances's friend after her death. I had some trouble believing some of the incidents actually happened, or if they were exaggerated. &quot;Shadowlands&quot; talks about her life before and after Hollywood (as well as the Steilicomb years). However, the author writes about the &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; episode: &quot;seeing it was a truly devestating experience&quot;, and says Frances barely uttered a word and was zoned out. We must have seen different shows. I saw that episode too and she looked perfectly fine to me, and she DID speak a lot. Anyway, good book.	2004-01-02

Believeing nothing just made sense in my bones. Yet I was still looking forward to her new book and read it all in two days. Maybe it's just that I want to believe. But Sylvia seems genuine. I just cannot believe she would make up all this stuff on purpose to make money. If that were true, she'd have retired by now and go live in paradise.<br />The book was very interesting and was mostly about hauntings. Many readers wrote in about their own experiences. I secretly wondered if Sylvia wrote them all herself, but that's just paranoia on my part. I have never had any experience of my own, and don't know anyone else who has, but supposedly there are thousands out there who have.<br />I did notice that often Sylvia makes it a point to say she keeps busy with pro-bono work. She'll find missing people for free. That's great- but how come when she has those Francine sessions, where people get to ask her Spirit Guide something for an outstanding fee per question, one of the rules is &quot;no missing people in this venue&quot;?<br />Elizabeth Short, a.k.a. &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; speaks from beyond too which I was very interested in. But she doesn't say what happened. The case isn't solved once and for all. Wouldn't this be the perfect time to reveal? From her herself?<br />I don't mean to sound critical. I really liked the book and I want to believe. Whether you do or don't, it's still very entertaining.	2003-10-17

From the beginning it explains how the ruling planets are not the same as zodiac signs. I saw no difference, only the titles have been altered. The author definitely put effort into this book, but the reason I didn't like it is because I don't agree with his definition of what my sign should be.

I suppose the information would be entertaining if it was the first book I read on the subject, or if I believed it. A lot of the explanations and revelations seem VERY similar to Sylvia Browne's, who was the first to write about the subject of &quot;the holding place&quot;, &quot;dark entities&quot;, and our charts, or blueprints we make before coming into life.<br />What Sylvia says works and makes sense, and I see a lot of psychic authors jumping on the Sylvia bandwagon. If all this is true, why wasn't it all revealed 10, 20, or 60 years ago? Why now all of the sudden?<br />Anyway, this book is very comforting to read, and nice to believe in, although it just doesn't ring true to me.	2003-07-26

I have read Christina's three other books, and have enjoyed them all, mostly \\"Mommie Dearest 20th Anniversary Edition\\". I looked everywhere for information about \\"Black Widow\\" and found nothing, didn't know what it was about. So I figured I'd just order it.<br />It's about a woman named Vivian who is selfish and evil, a recent widow, who tries to rid of her son and stepdaughter. Clearly the character of Vivian is based on \\"Mommie\\", and some of the events in the story (like the son being imprisoned and Vivian leaving him in jail) are similar to \\"Mommie Dearest\\".<br />I didn't care too much for it because with this author, all I want to hear about is Mommie, Mommie, MOMMIE! I LOVE her tales, and prefer reading about real life. I can't wait for Christina's new book about the Inquisition, due out later this year. But I understand that Christina Crawford probably doesn't want to spend the rest of her life talking about the woman who made her life a living hell. Totally understandable. I'd say \\"Black Widow\\" is maybe a good one-time read, but I'd recommend \\"Survivor\\", or of course, the classic \\"Mommie Dearest\\".	2003-06-26

I learned of Lauren Chapin from an episode of the &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;. I had to know more so I got this book. It was written in the late 1980s, '89 I believe. Her abusive father lived to see this book, but I don't know if he read it (I doubt it). One thing on the TV special that is not in the book is when Lauren was by her father's side when he died. He aparantly showed no remorse or appologies for the horrific abuse he put his daughter through, and asked if there was a Hell. Lauren replied &quot;Well, you're soon gonna find out!&quot;.<br />One very important thing: This is NOT just another whining celebrity autobiography, &quot;Waaa waaa, oh, woe is me. I had it so bad&quot;. We've ALL had it bad at some point in our lives. But most of us, thankfully, not like this. The fact that Lauren kept going is a mortal miracle. However, later in the book, I didn't feel that sorry for her when she went back to one of her abusive boyfriends. I remember that saying, &quot;hit me once, shame on you. Hit me twice, shame on me&quot;. When someone hits someone they &quot;love&quot; (or anyone for that matter), there is NO excuse for it and is unforgivable.<br />I'm glad Lauren came out on top. I don't personally share her religeous beliefs, but I am happy that she was able to put her life back together, because she really did hit rock bottom. This is a MUST READ!!	2003-06-22

There is a guaranteed laugh on every page of this book. I LOVE how just when you're about to find out what Pat is, SOMETHING comes up to prevent it. The whole joke will never get old to me. I'm also a big fan of the movie about Pat. I love how Pat thinks it's attractive. Pat's so ugly! It's so hilarious, I love it! I only wish they'd make a movie called &quot;It's Chris&quot;. Personally, I think Pat is the guy and Chris is the girl. Just because I see men wear the blue shirt and slacks, never women. And Chris is real feminine, with &quot;it's&quot; clothing.

I bought this book the first day it came out and I was very into it. I have everything by this author and was always a huge fan. But recently I've been wondering about her credibility, and \\"psychics\\" in general. I've subscribed to Sylvia's newsletter for the last few years and almost NONE of her predictions come true. In fact, only after something happens does she publicly say \\"I knew it all along\\".<br />But she's so darn convincing! She seems to know very well what she's talking about which means one of three things: 1., She's for real; 2., she's schizophrenic and belives herself; or 3, (and I hope not!) she's making it all up. Most of the questions she gets on Montel are \\"What's my Spirit Guide's name?\\" and \\"When will I find true love?\\", and can easily be answered falsly by anyone. Also when she describes a departed loved one, she describes them very generically. Recently on Larry King a woman asked about her late grandmother, and Sylvia asked \\"Was she a short woman who wore her hair back?\\". WHAT OLD LADY IS TALL WITH LONG FLOWING HAIR??? Sylvia said Grandma sends birds around her. Well you're bound so see birds sooner or later!<br />She also uses attractive words, like \\"CRYSTAL green\\", and \\"sparkle\\" and \\"glisten\\" when telling her tales.<br />And has anyone ever had a personal 30-minute reading with ANY of these psychic authors? When I call their offices, they're always \\"too busy\\" on lecture tours or promoting their latest book, to do readings. Something's fishy...<br />Anyway, I would LOVE to take Sylvia's word as the absolute truth, but my own intuition is skeptical. I'll still continue to read them though, just because she's a great author, or I'm a sucker.	2003-06-18

It uses laughable language that was popular in the 1950s, like \\"licking\\", \\"hip\\", and others. It makes me mad to read that Gary's father beat him with belts and canes, but I don't feel too bad because Gary just TOOK IT! Why don't you grow a backbone and stand up for yourself to \\"the old man\\" (oh yes, that was another one that got real annoying).<br />The only thing I thought was tacky was using Christina Crawford's best seller \\"Mommie Dearest\\" on his own book cover to promote this book (the paperback). He writes something like \\"Joan Crawford was a Mary Poppins compared to Bing\\". I thought it was in bad taste. Everyone's got to do an upmanship: \\"You think so-and-so had it bad, wait until you hear MY story...\\" And for the record I think Christina had it WORSE than Gary. But this was still an enjoyable book and I'm sad that Gary's not around anymore.	2003-06-16

US	39585180	R1JZ4E0VVHTZ64	0671240331	896279140	Joan Crawford	Books	5	9	17	N	N	Best Joan biography	My favorite will always be Christina's book &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, but this book gave a much more detailed background of Joan's childhood and early years in Hollywood, as well as her last years. I am surprised that someone so famous would have nothing to do but sit in her apartment all day and answer letters. You'd think someone like that would have so many friends and always have something planned every night.<br />I don't think someone that famous- and this refers to Joan in the 1950s and 60s- had to worry about being a &quot;has-been&quot;. She already had an Oscar and everyone knew her name. She will ALWAYS be famous. A good comparison would probably be John Travolta. He has made some great classics (&quot;Grease&quot;), but his last couple of movies have been bombs. So what. He'll always be around.<br />I think Joan was a great friend to her peers, there's no doubt. Her treatment towards her children was horrific. This was no secret in Hollywood, either. Christina was no crybaby who wrote her book because she was disinherited. If someone brought it up to Joan to lighten up, they were asked to leave the house or told to mind their own business. No wonder Christopher kept running away!! And where's the logic in punishment with physcial harm because he tried to run away? That would just make him want to leave MORE.<br />I definitely recommend this, it's the best Joan biography to date.	2003-05-07

I know she has to make a living too, but if she's really here to help people she wouldn't charge exorbitant fees for a reading.<br />However, I am happy she exposes the tricks of true frauds and their techniques. She is so correct on the silliness of voodoo and curses, and how they do not exist.<br />I hope with all my heart she's the real deal. I would love for everything she says to be true, but in the back of my mind I'll never really know for sure. When I see her on TV talking to someone about there dead loved one, she'll describe them as \\"beautiful eyes, sharp features, oval shaped face, and a sweet smile\\". That could be ANYONE.

No way would a man like that get away with anything like that today. After reading into it, and as much as I detest bullies, I started to feel less and less compassion for the townspeople. Take a stand! Assulted victims would get threatened or beaten up so they dropped the charges!?

This is probably my favorite of her books. I really hope she's the real deal. Everything she says makes sense, but in the back of my mind I can't help but wonder about her credibility. For example, when she's telling someone about their deceased loved one, she'll say &quot;Did they have beautiful eyes, oval shaped face, broad features, sweet smile?&quot;. That could be anyone! EVERYONE thinks their loved one has &quot;beautiful eyes&quot;. You'll never hear a mother say about her dead son &quot;Oh no, he was very unpleasant looking&quot;.<br />  The last review is correct. Sylvia does give very good advivce and is inspirational. So I guess that makes this book worth it alone.	2003-04-29
US	39585180	RQ35Z18UL7Y9U	0061008893	286744086	Saved by the Light	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Great story	It's definately a great story, but I would have been more convinced if some of the predictions were still to come so we can validate them as well. Most of them already happened when the book came out, so it's easy to claim they're psychic predictions.<br />  I use to believe that the Other Side and N.D.E.'s were for real. But now that I'm older I don't just believe everything I'm told. Sure, I'd love for it all to be real, but I don't know. There are good arguments supporting both sides. Like, if one is dead, and the spirit floats above the room and can see everything, that cannot possibly be a hallucination. On the other hand, it may all be made up for entertainment purposes only.	2003-04-28

But logic convinces me it's only a tale to give a false sense of security. It reminds me of those ghost stories on &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, or those &quot;Haunted Lives&quot; TV specials- I believe it's all made up for entertainment purposes only. I'm not closed minded. I have read so many books on this subject, but now that I'm older I don't just believe everything I'm told.	2003-04-28

I remember seeing this in a book store a few years ago and I read through some chapters. Please. I cannot believe that anyone with half a brain takes this stuff seriously. I do believe there are some genuine mediums out there, Sylvia Browne being a good one. But anyone who runs a psychic hotline (we all know how THOSE work!!) and says dead movie stars come to HIM for revelations has GOT to be a quack. Did he (or his ghostwriter, I should say) actually think for one minute anyone would believe this nonsense? I saw NO disclaimer on this book. PLEASE don't spend your dollars here. It's not even worth checking out to see how phoney it is.	2003-04-13

I have read the 20th Anniversary Edition of \\"Mommie Dearest\\" over and over. \\"No Safe Place\\" has some more brief stories of Mommie, which I could listen to all day. Christina has definitely done her homework for this book, with extensive research and her own firsthand experience. Anyone looking for recommendations for Self Help books should surely give this book a try.<br />Stop being Jive-Turkeys and voting against my review!	2003-04-03

I would love for everything Sylvia says to be correct, but to me it seems easier and more logical to believe that there is no &quot;Other Side&quot;. I guess I don't really know. She says it best, on page 29: &quot;Naysayers say it's just another fantasy to relieve our minds and give us a false sense of security&quot;. But I guess if it makes people feel better, what does it matter?<br />  I have read all her work, but things are getting a little far fetched in this edition, with angels flying around with magic wands. But it could be true.<br />  I wonder why angels only appear to select few? I wonder if Joan Crawford (&quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;) was a dark entity? I don't even know someone who knows someone who have seen a ghost or an angel. Until I have personal assurance, I will remain an open-minded skeptic.<br />  This was a good read, as well as all her material. I didn't give the fifth star beause I just don't believe it's true. But as long as she tells me what I want to hear, I'll continue to read them.	2003-03-26

But I LOVE Christina Crawford's book and her version is more fun to believe.<br />  I liked this book, but all I was really interested in was what the author had to write about defending Joan, which wasn't detailed until the last chapter. He writes that Joan was abused by an ugrateful daughter. But how do you explain Joan not bothering to show up at Christina's high school graduation, and leaving her with only TWO dresses to wear for half a school year? What about telling everyone Chrsitina was expelled from school which was false and easily proven by Joan's own letters to Christina? I just cannot believe Christina would sit down and make up all those cruel letters Joan wrote to her growing up. I wonder if she still has them?<br /> The one part that did make me sad was when Joan was having one of her late night calls with the author and cried \\"I think Christina's going to write a book about me\\".<br /> Also sad is that Joan slept her way to the top. Hollywood is such a sleazy town. Talent has very little to do with success, it's all about how you LOOK and who you'll sleep with to get there.<br />  I would have liked to know what her other three children are doing these days. I haven't heard anything about Christopher at all for a long time.	2002-09-23

I have been looking forward to this book for a long time now, and I was very satisfied. Unlike the last book (&quot;Conversations With the Other Side&quot;) which was just a repeat of her old meterial, this was fresh and a great read.<br />  Personally, I don't know if I believe in God anymore, but that really doesn't matter to learn something from this book. This one will stay on my bookshelf.	2002-07-24

Nothing in this book would be inappropriate for a 6-year-old to see. All the pictures were in black and white and NONE of them were gory. This book is just recycled stories we've all heard about dead celebs with a portrait of them included. It should be called &quot;My First Mystery Book&quot;. Very disappointing.	2002-04-11

I only gave 4 stars because I would have liked to know more about the last few days of her life and her death (the book talks at length about her last years, but not her last days).<br />  She died alone and broke, which is surprising. Didn't they have residuals back then? How could Hollywood allow this to happen to one of it's own? But then on the other hand, she's the one who squandered away her millions of dollars.<br />  I would have also liked to hear what her children had to say. Her mother (is she still alive? She must be a thousand!!) was interviewed though.	2002-03-12

I've read all her books and this one has all the same information. As much as I don't want to believe it, I'm starting to think maybe she IS only after making money. And she didn't even write this, her \\"Spirit Guide\\" wrote it from the Other Side. I don't know-<br />  I truely don't believe she's fraudulent. She's helped so many. But I have caught her in a lie. On January 3, 2000, she appeared on Montel and when asked about celebrity couples who would stay together, she said Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman would remain married. A year later, they divorced and Sylvia was back  on Montel and said \\"I knew all along\\".<br />  And how do you justify [the money] per question just to ask her spirit guide Francine, something? I do think she's for real but it makes me sad that ordinary people like me who can't afford a $700 reading are out of luck.	2002-03-12

When so many people only rate a one star, someone may get so curious and buy the book just to see how bad it is. But honestly, don't bother. I got to the middle and lost interest, and after a few months of it on the shelf I wound up throwing it away. The author has no credibility, and I don't want to waste my time with fantasies.	2002-03-12
