The artworks that actually show Spidey in action, or even just him alone are barely there. I wondered why they titled this book Caught in the Web then. The majority of the portion is allocated to the creation and brainstorming over Dock Ock and his tentacles. I mean, c'mon guys, I like Dock Ock but please..please show him in action with Spidey. And where are those conceptual drawings that depict the cool train fight. I noticed only one pic about it is in the book. It's just unbelievable that this comes from the same author of Behind the Mask. And lastly, where's the all important script???	2004-07-08

Given the right ingredients of darkness and grim &amp; gritty tone, he would've soared through the comic market hall of fame to the likes of Batman or Daredevil.<br />Yet, here again, that cool-costumed vigilante (lose the stupid cape please) fell short of his true potential to weave an interesting domain of urban ghetto universe. Had they brought him to a more down to earth, yet serious conflicts, his coolness and danger would've shown through. If Marvel read this, just give me the Black Panther and I'll revamp the character through and through so he will be a badass king of dark, urban costumed crimefighters.	2004-07-08

Yet this book leaves out many of those elements in favor of blurred panoramic art pieces that I found rather wasteful to the content of the book.Don't get me wrong, I like this book. Most of the artworks are astounding, it's just that I found many of the splash pages should've been devoted to more breathtaking images such as the Fell Beasts attacking Minas Tirith or Sam fighting off Shelob.	2004-07-07

That's all I need to know to decide to buy the book. I used to assume that given his dynamic and action-oriented drawing style, it would be weird to see Jim Lee tackle the dark, grim and gritty portrayal of Batman's world. The story is just decent. I see that it neither has depth nor good character development. But I don't care, I bought it for the art alone and the art really delivers! I could spend hours savoring the illustration alone and not caring about the story. Sorry Jeph Loeb but if the sales of this book is great it's because of Jim Lee.	2004-07-07

Despite the rather silly premise of the movie itself, I bought this book for the art alone. I am a fan of monster designs and I have to say that the creature designs on this book (the Hellbeast and Werewolf)are worth every penny of it. The costumes, sets, and creatures' transformation are magnificent. I have only one dislike about the look of the Frankenstein monster which seems to be lifted out of the Munsters. If you're into dark creatures and monsters, you'll like this book.	2004-07-05

I was unfamiliar with the world of Hellboy prior to seeing the movie. When I did and when I ordered this book, I was blown away by the wealth of visual richness that inhabit the Hellboy universe. Being a collector of &quot;Art of...&quot; books, I realized that the strength of Hellboy lies in the visual galore. The book is fully detailed with drawings from every level of production as well as the closeness of working atmosphere between the filmakers and the creator of the original material not commonly known in Hollywood.<br />My only gripe in this book is that the structuring is kinda messed up and confusing, since the book mixes up the art section with the script.	2004-07-05

Yet it almost feels flat when compared with the fun and originality that we get from the first. The book Inside MIB II suffers the same handicap. While it provides more insight into the sequel, it falls flat on the hilarity and the mystery of the first film.

Otherwise if you are a lycanthrophile this one is the book to go. Sometimes it not only discusses werewolf but other shapeshifting beings as well, making it an interesting pastime.<br />However, since werewolf is fictitious, no matter what you think, most of what is written in this book is derived (gasp!) from movies. So don't take it too seriously.<br />We have our inner beasts to contend with, but let's face it, it's more metaphoric than literary.	2002-07-10

The story leaps out of the pages in the tradition of a Hollywood fast-cut cinematography.<br />The story leaves you hanging for more but like any good thriller, it should be best left unresolved. Domu masterfully combines element of Carrie and Silence of the Lambs in which two unlikely gifted humans are locked in a dangerous game of mind-blowing telekinetic powers. Somebody should make a movie out of it. This peredecessor of Akira has managed to stay in the realm of believable urban setting, thus making it easier to relate to.	2002-05-10

First of all, this book is basically an extended special edition coverage that we see in the paperback Behind the Mask of Spider-Man, except that this one has the shooting script in it. I believe by now almost all the people who read this review have seen the movie. Some scenes in the script had been deleted from the final theatrical cut, probably on budget constraint. Other than that the book is in the same true spirit of the paperback version. The sharp featured cover alone is worth the value. Makes an interesting read for every die-hard Spidey fans.	2002-05-10

Now that he got his hands on writing comics, I assumed that this would be the person with the caliber of Alan Moore or Frank Miller to start such a hype among comic and movie fans alike. Well, storylinewise, it seems that Smith tried to emulate the grim and gritty approach a la Miller, yet in doing so his story tends to get hackneyed with the notion of been there and done that to the readers. It is so apparent that Smith tried to dramatize the event by cramming up his story with too many shallow subplots before pulling the plug on Karen Page.<br />Everything in the book feels just so-so, or perhaps I was expecting too much from a writer whose reputation has gone far beyond comic book.	2002-02-17

The man attrction of this book is definitely the storyboards and conceptual designs done in the tradition of a comic book renderings. The combination of the shooting script and the storyboards give you a glimpse on how to sell ideas to a studio on such a hard-to-grasp-concept as The Matrix before it became a movie. It does not go to much to the behind the scenes stuff, probably because they want to advertise that this movie is propelled by their creators' love for graphic novels and visual strengths of the comic book genres. Maybe in the future it can inspire anyone with good hard-selling script to create the storyboards in order to sell tothe studios.	2002-01-14
