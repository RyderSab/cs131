I picked up this book with great anticipation based on my love for Jakes' ability to make a story come alive when he is teaching from the pulpit and in his inspirational writings. Unfortunately that ability did not transfer to the art of fiction novel writing. <br /> <br />In this tale, we meet a host of women who are connected primarily by friendship or work.  The story attempts to follow the changes in these women's lives as they encounter trials and tribulations. I did not find the characters or the storylines to be well developed.  Often when attempting to infuse faith into the characters lives, it felt that sections of sermons had been lifted and abruptly plunked down into the middle of the story. <br /> <br />It is my conclusion that Jakes gift for teaching is best left to face-to-face ministry and the writing of inspirational non-fiction.	2005-10-05

In \\"Counting Raindrops\\", author Cherlyn Michaels treats us to a delightful romance from an unpredictable viewpoint. Vanella Morris is deeply in love with her mate of six years Alton.  Yet she is happy with the status quo.  Both gainfully employed, Vanella and Alton have a satisfying, yet exciting, relationship that takes them on exciting vacations to supplement the blissful life they have created for themselves.

When he proposes that they move to the next step, all hell breaks loose.  We thus begin a journey of uncertainty and self discovery with Vanella that is wonderfully written. <br /> <br />I truly enjoyed the landscape of the journey, which included exploring Vanella's family relationships and friendships, as well as her future career goals.   <br /> <br />After such a delightful journey, I hope that Cherlyn Michaels is busy at work on another novel.	2005-09-27

She's dedicated to her new catering business and her friends and family. <br /> <br />Quintin doesn't now if he will ever find a woman he deems worthy of marrying. So he's established his life through his work of professional photography and painting and established the dream of owning his own sailboat. <br /> <br />After their very first disagreement, Quintin and Victoria have a few more encounters fueled by apparent dislike, but more by their confusion over being so fiercely attracted to each other despite the fact that neither of them is looking for a deep romantic involvement. <br /> <br />Soon, however, both of them are questioning their romantic resolve after meeting a few times and quickly become intimately involved. <br /> <br />The romance developed rather quickly and it was hard for me to discern the foundation of the deep romantic interest that Quintin proclaimed after a few days of meeting Victoria.

She has come to this position after walking away from a position as an assistant chef in a thriving, well regarded restaurant after being passed over from promotions one too many times.  Lydia has been hurt by unfulfilled love in the past and comes to the company to focus on her potential for opening her own restaurant and with no thoughts of looking for love.  This all changes on the very first day at camp when she meets her cabin neighbor and camp sports director Kennedy. <br /> <br />Kennedy has walked away from an illustrious career in sports at the height of his popularity and money-earning potential; he is owner and sports director of this camp that fulfills his dream to help those who have had fewer successful opportunities than he.  He, too, has been scarred by romances gone wrong in the past and has sworn off serious commitments with women.  Something about the gutsy, confident Lydia shakes his resolve on that point however.   <br /> <br />In this book, Alers explores the coming together of these two wounded and mature souls in an all-satisfying way that explores both their friendship and burgeoning romantic interest.  The book is a 2-in-1 bonus that also contains the previously published novel \\"Home Sweet Home\\" in which Lydia was first introduced as the younger sister of the male romantic lead Quintin Lord.  Although this second story doesn't rise to the same level of greatest as the newer one, it is a nice touch to include it in the same book.	2005-09-11

Having met briefly in the home of Kirkland's in-laws, these characters are drawn together in a powerful way when Kirkland happens upon a traffic accident in which Cassidy is trapped in a car on the verge of giving birth. Having participated in the delivery of Cassidy's daughter Courtney, Kirkland feels a strong draw to the baby and her attractive mother. <br /> <br />In this book, Ms. White offers a nice mix of romance and drama.  Both Cassidy and Kirkland have their own personal demons to face, as they try to build a relationship together. The additional dramatic elements introduced through each of their individual stories, as well as the relationship issues they are dealing with, including the fact that Cassidy is nine years older than Kirkland, add greatly to the intrigue of this tale. <br /> <br />I haven't read the first book in this series (Only in My Dreams) that focused on Kirkland's older brother Greyson, but that didn't affect my ability to follow the storyline and thoroughly enjoy the interactions between the main characters, as well as their interactions with their family members and friends. <br /> <br />I am eagerly looking forward to Chevy Ballantyne's story.

Author Kalisha Buckhanon offers a breathtaking, seldom used approach to novel writing. Through a series of letters exchanged between Natasha and Antonio, we follow the story of these ill-fated young lovers. The book opens with Antonio imprisoned for killing his father and his impassioned plea for Natasha to believe in his innocence and their burgeoning love. Only 16-years-old at the time of his incarceration, Antonio and the 15-year-old Natasha begin a valiant fight to maintain their love, and indeed their friendship which grew during their common upbringing in Harlem, through the trials of physical and emotional separation.    This novel refreshingly follows their separate and intersecting tales as they grow from teenagers blindly in love into adults facing the dire reality of attempting to maintain a relationship through prison bars.    As I reluctantly came to the end of this journey, I could only hope for more novels from Ms. Buckhanon in the near future and a thoughtful, thorough movie adaptation of this wonderful story.	2005-08-17

It follows her from her childhood through challenging years as an adolescent and young adult into her life as a celebrated musician.    The author writes well and pays great attention to detail. However, there was just too much detail in parts for me and that resulted in the story seeming too long and drawn out. The book started with a very brief introduction to Ashela's love interest Sam before going back to tell her story from the very beginning of her childhood.  Although the book visits Sam's rise from child to music executive, its almost 160 pages into the book before Ashela and Sam's stories intersect. Once they unite as adults the story picks up and moves along at a more satisfying pace.    An interesting, but often distracting, literary tool used by the author was the inclusion of many prominent celebrities in the storyline.    I certainly give much credit to author Robyn Williams for her attention to detail and a realistic portrayal of the music business, even though I wished for the plot to move along much more rapidly.	2005-08-05

Elaine Bartlett's story is at times mind-boggling. A product of an impoverished life in New York, Elaine decides to make quick money by delivering a drug package.  Caught up in a sting operation, Elaine is sent to prison for 20-years-to-life in her first offense due to the stringent Rockefeller drugs laws in NY. <br /> <br />Author Jennifer Gonnerman follows the story of Elaine from her life growing up in New York as one of a number of siblings who eventually face tremendous struggles with imprisonment and drugs to her journey of trying to reestablish her life after receiving clemency 16 years into her sentence.  Gonnerman writes in a simplistic, direct style that weaves the political and social climate with the details of Bartlett's personal journey. She gives a fair portrayal of Bartlett who is not altogether a saint nor completely an unredeemable sinner. <br /> <br />This engaging story leads one to think deeply about strict, mandatory sentencing laws and their unbalanced impact on portions of the American citizenry. It compels one to think about the failure of prison to prepare inmates, particularly mothers, for life after their release. It leads one to consider whether the American citizen truly considers rehabilitation of offenders or simply focuses on isolation. This book is a testament to the power of a good biography to move the reader to think deeply about a number of important issues.	2005-07-14

Kahlila has a host of good friends, including old friends from high school who are attending the same college and new friends including her roommates Robyn and Desiree. <br /> <br />Kahlila's life is going good as the story opens.  She's a popular, self-assured student who has a great friend in Desiree and a well-liked boyfriend Tariq. Things start to change for Kahlila once she enrolls in a Black Collective Responsibility class.  A socially aware individual, Kahlila soon has the ear of the professor as she injects well-thought comments into the class.  She also has the eye of the course's teaching assistant, the older and wiser David. <br /> <br />Though David is also involved in a relationship, he and Kahlila begin to develop a friendship as they are chosen to work together on a summer program for local high school students. <br /> <br />The novel explores their burgeoning friendship, as well as taking side journeys into the lives of Kahlila and David's friends and acquaintances. <br /> <br />The novel got off to a slow start for me and took me a couple of weeks to finish, though I usually finish a book in a couple of days or so. Although it accurately portrayed college life for many students, the raw language and great detail provided about the social lives of the students were drawn out in parts.  Ms. Skerritt uses a variety of literary tools to inject uniqueness into her story telling - these included the opening tool of switching between narrators and was followed by the use of e-mails, letters, poems, and song lyrics. While such tools can add an interesting element to stories, I think she used too many, too often in this book. <br /> <br />Although the story of Kahlila and David was interesting and well develop, too many side stories were introduced but not thoroughly investigated or concluded for my likes. <br /> <br />Overall, I thought this was an interesting, if long, tale of the lives of African-American college students geared for teenagers to young-adults.	2005-06-27

In the opening of this novel, Vashti is presenting the last will and testament of her former client to his children - son Dr. Cameron Grande and daughter Camella. Cameron has been heartbroken and devastated after the loss of his beloved parents until he meets the intriguing Vashti.  Vashti initially rebuffs any budding interest in her on the part of Cameron as she doesn't want to jeopardize her burgeoning career with her law firm by dating a client. She's also concerned that the wealthy Cameron could truly be interested in her as she comes from a working class background <br /> <br />Cameron has other problems to face, including the threat of his spoiled sister to contest the will so that she gets a bigger piece of the pie.  Cameron, however, is determined not to let personal issues or Vashti's reservations get in the way of his pursuit of this fascinating woman with which he shares so much including a common Christian faith. Thus a relentless, if old-fashioned, pursuit ensues. <br /> <br />Written in 1998, this novel draws upon romance novel formulas of old in its formulaic and unapologetically chaste handling of this boy-meet-girls tale. Many of the descriptions of the interactions between Vashti and Cameron could have easily been lifted from an old Emily Bronte or Jane Austen tale.  This is not to say that the characters lack chemistry however. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the novel the author attempt to insert drama and mystery into the tale, this however was not well developed earlier in the book and thus seemed abrupt.  It also resulted in a hasty, less than satisfying end to the story. <br /> <br />All in all, I was disappointed in this book as a contemporary African-American romance. Many elements including issues of class, family interference and ex-boyfriends were introduced but none of them added greatly to this story which just seemed to lack a core excitement.	2005-06-15

Justice and Tony meet as Justice and her traffic patrol partner are just finishing the installation of a boot on Tony's car.  Despite his annoyance at dealing with the immobilization of his car, Tony is drawn to Justice immediately and lets it be clearly known.  Justice, though flattered and physically attracted, is not interested in Tony who she perceives as a \\"playa\\".    Shortly after this first incidence, Tony and Justice meet again when Police Officer Tony pulls Justice over for a traffic violation.  Justice is still both attracted and annoyed, but after a third chance meeting can no longer fight her growing interest in Tony.    A short volume of only 192 pages, \\"A Happy Life\\" nonetheless covers a long range of time and a myriad of issues. The supporting cast consists of a host of family and friends that add nicely to the story of Justice and Tony.     One of my major complaints about the books is that the author's writing style lacks substantive transitions.  Often I'd have to reread several sentences as the author jumped from one scene/timeframe to another in mid-paragraph.  This made for a frustrating read at times. Also some of the dramatic flavor of the story was abruptly and unrealistically introduced. More background on these issues would have made for a more complete, satisfying story.    All in all however, this is a fast-paced romance that presents a well-rounded view of Justice and Tony's story.	2005-06-13

This is the collection I've been waiting years for.... <br /> <br />Simply put, this is the collection of a life time.  The collected autobiographies of Maya Angelou is a must have for the diehard fan. I've always said that the only thing I truly envy about Oprah Winfrey is her beautiful relationship with this wise, brilliant woman.  Dr. Angelou's life is an amazing story that has unfolded over decades through her series of six autobiographical books.  From the very first book, \\"I know why the caged bird sings\\", which focused on the silenced young Maya growing up part-time in Arkansas with her grandmother, through the tales of the young independent woman who struck out to pursue her own destiny in the U.S. and abroad, all the way to the celebrated writer of today, this collection takes us along for the amazing journey that is Dr. Angelou's life. <br /> <br />Having read each of her autobiographical books over the past 20 years, I truly looked forward to the opportunity to relive these fascinating accounts again through this volume. As we traverse the terrain of her life, which contains many fascinating details including her international singing career, her struggle as a single mother, her sojourn to Africa and her involvement in the civil right's movement, we are reminded of the depth of experiences and wealth of knowledge that she possesses. I stood firmly once again in wonder of this phenomenal woman. To see a woman emerge from such a journey with the beautiful confidence and poise that Dr. Angelou possesses is nothing short of amazing and completely uplifting. <br /> <br /> This collection is a dream come true for me and now one of my prized possessions. I was truly reminded that when it comes to writing and living life fully, for me no one does it better.	2005-06-06

This novel focuses on three women who meet at an open call for models in New York City and soon are on the path to friendship.    Patterson is from a small town in Georgia and has dreamed of being a model all of her life. A sheltered Southern belle who is also a strict Christian, Patterson is off to the big city to chase her dream.  Patterson has the solid faith of a child that all will work out well for her. Despite her innocence, or because of it, she is soon off on her path to fame and is being pursued by a handsome New York man.  Patterson's strict moral values and faith will be tested as she tries to adjust to life at the fast pace of NYC.    LaRue is a bit older and wiser than Patterson.  Having survived the loss of her husband and friend in a matter of months, LaRue is angry with God and moving to New York to pursue a new life including modeling. LaRue is running from God, but still feels the tugging of the Spirit in her life.    Finally, there is the spoiled rotten Macy who has been pampered all her life.  She's been in school for years jumping from major to major as her parents foot the bill for her extravagant life.  After failing to graduate once again her parents have had enough.  The prospect of having to fund her own lavish life style sends Macy off on a job search.  Macy's desperation leads her to take them in Patterson and LaRue as roommates.  Macy is facing the anger of being \\"dumped\\" by her parents and the loneliness of her life despite all the outward trappings of success and happiness.    These three women are each facing their own challenges, in addition to the challenge of their burgeoning friendship.  The first two-thirds of the novel focuses in great detail on their stuttering attempts at friendships.  As the characters are at times one dimensional - i.e. the innocent/naive Patterson, spoiled rich girl Macy and older and wiser LaRue - this novel really dragged on slowly for me. I was also highly distracted and annoyed by the phonetic attempts to capture Patterson's southern dialect.    Even the \\"climax\\" of the novel was a bit disappointing as everything quickly fell neatly into place for each of the characters.  Not my favorite novel by Ms. Thomas, \\"Saved in the City\\" was only average for me.  I did appreciate the realistic portrayals of these ladies struggles to walk in Christianity and the accountability and support they showed for each other in this regard.  That was the saving grace for this novel by Ms. Thomas.	2005-06-05
US	42566380	R3RJJ4BYMVZ2HL	0743270975	551595777	Grown Folks Business: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	It had me from the very first sentence.	This book was bound to be written since the great fervor erupted over J.L. King's nonfiction book \\"On the Down Low\\".  I'm glad that it was written by Victoria Christopher Murray, one of my favorite authors.  Ms. Murray is a wonderful story teller that seamlessly blends a Christian message into a good storyline.  Her style is classic novelist who happens to be a Christian, rather than preachy Christian who wants to write a novel.    In this story, Sheridan's world is turned upside down in the first few sentences of this book as her husband tells her that he is in love with someone else.  As she begins to ponder who the woman could be that has intruded on her lovely marriage, the situation becomes emotionally unbearable as she is informed that her husband is in fact in love with another man.    After seventeen years of an idyllic marriage, this is the last thing Sheridan was expecting to hear.  After insisting that he pack up and leave, Sheridan is left with the aftermath of this situation.  She struggles with how to help her young daughter, an unabashed daddy's girl, and her teenaged son deal with the news about their beloved daddy.  As her son rebels and she deals with the input and judgments of family members and church members alike, Sheridan has to truly call upon her faith to see her through this situation.  Like so many, Sheridan realizes that it's not so easy to turn off the emotions that have been nurtured for nearly two decades.    A story line such as this could quickly descend into clichs, comedy or worse. Yet, Ms. Murray writes a story that builds sympathy for all involved.  Rather than simply display Sheridan's husband as the villain and Sheridan as the victim, the author teases apart the psyches of all involved resulting in a compelling story of what could happen when life is turn upside down unexpectedly.  Through it all, Sheridan's Christianity and faith are strong foundations at every turn of uncertainty.    I must admit when I heard the subject matter of Ms. Murray's latest novel, I worried that the overexposure of J.L. King's book and R. Kelley's latest song series on the same topic was indicative of a topic overexposed and over dissected.  However, to my delight and surprise, Ms. Murray brought a fresh, thorough view to the subject with her characteristically good storytelling style.  Well done!	2005-06-05

Dr. Sheridan Wexler has had enough of the big city of Nashville, so she relocates to a small practice in the small town of Duck River.  Soon after starting work in her new position, her new coworkers including the practice owner Dr. Chase Larson find her a bit standoffish. <br /> <br />Sheridan has been hurt deeply in the past and is reluctant to form close bonds.  Chase, however, is intrigued by her and wants to get to know her better as both a colleague and as a woman.  They begin a quiet affair that is progressing well until Sheridan's ex-husband surfaces and throws a monkey wrench in Chase's progress. <br /> <br />As secrets start to emerge about Sheridan, the story grows immensely more interesting and unpredictable. <br /> <br />Although this book took off to a slow start, it develops into an interesting story about a woman who has to decide what's best for her - sticking with the past or opening herself to a new, unforeseeable future.	2005-06-03

She loves the traditional music of the services. Though others seem to want to move to modern praise music, Haley believes no musical changes are necessary. Having recognized the need for change and revitalization, the Pastor moves forward in the hiring of a new Musical Director who will revamp the worship service. <br /> <br />Former music star Matt Brandon has had enough of chasing fame and fortune. He has escaped to small town Oregon to enjoy a quieter life and to get back to his first true love which is simply making beautiful contemporary music. Matt has lots of ideas about what he'd like to do with the new order of the music service - until he meets a solid brick wall of resistance in Haley. <br /> <br />Seeing the sparks that are bouncing between them both in their conflicting musical views and their mutual attraction, the pastor assigns them to strike a musical balance for the church by working together on the revamped music for worship service.  Soon, both Haley and Matt are wondering if they will be able to get over their differences for the sake of the congregation. <br /> <br />Matt is also wondering if he can get Haley to act upon their obvious mutual attraction. <br /> <br />This was a nice Christian romance with quaint touches and a strong chemistry between the lead characters.	2005-06-02

Marcus Ambrose decides to take a break from his grueling schedule as a popular R&B star and participate in a musical festival in a small town in Oregon. <br /> <br />Dr. Kara Spencer, best friend to Haley Cartwright featured in a prior Mason novel \\"Sweet Accord\\", is a local psychologist with a big heart for helping the town's youth.  She, for one, is not impressed with the `great' Marcus Ambrose.  She is repelled by his secular, worldly music and cocky attitude. He is the exact opposite of the humbly, godly man that Kara seeks in a mate.  Or so it seems... <br /> <br />Marcus sets out on a mission to change Kara's mind about him.  He is a man who loves God and for years has been seeking a way to express his spirituality through inspirational music.  He wants to use his celebrity for good, but can he convince Kara that he is indeed the godly man she's been looking for?  He has a tough job ahead of him as Kara is determined not to give in to her physical attraction to him. <br /> <br />Much like \\"Sweet  Accord\\", the rural Oregon setting for the book makes you forget at times that this is a contemporary tale.  The slow-paced life and small town America values are refreshing to the underlying Christian themes, however. <br /> <br />The story of Kara and Marcus is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.	2005-06-02

Their friendship is based on many shared memories that we are exposed to through flashbacks and strong feelings of love and protection. After years of serving as each others sounding board for past relationships, triumphs and disasters, they've decided to act on the strong feelings that exist between them.  Soon after they move in together, Nina's insecurities about the job Aaron holds as a bartender at a strip club soon threaten their happy future.  Soon curiosity overwhelms her and Nina sneaks a visit to see with her own eyes the only dancer that Aaron has admitted once have considered as a prospective girlfriend, whose name is aptly Cocoa.  Nina is harboring her own demons including the tumultuous relationship she has with her vagabond father.  Nina's insecurities explode when she finds pictures of Cocoa \\"hidden\\" among many that aspiring photographer Aaron has taken in the past.  All of the issues in their relationship come to a head when this finding is uncovered. <br /> <br />Nina and Aaron's bond is well established in this book.  As a reader I was really rooting for them when they decided to pursue a relationship.  The twists and turns that are interjected due to the personal issues each of them is dealing with add nice tension to this friends-turned-lovers tale. I also like the style of the book that alternates between telling the story of each of their perspectives.	2005-05-26

Davis had a deep personal impetus to understand not only the inner workings of the KKK, but more importantly the motivations and constitutions of the men who join this organization. <br /> <br />It is clear that Davis's journey, which includes conversations with several individuals associated with this organization at many different levels and others who have been impacted by their interactions with the organization, had a deep personal impact on him and PERHAPS some of the men who he encountered whom later ended their affiliation with the KKK. <br /> <br />Though I personally have no deep-seated interest in understanding what makes one associate with such a divisive, contemptible organization and thus am clearly not the target audience for this volume, I give Davis credit for seeking answers to his own personal quandaries in such a thorough and potentially risky journey.	2005-05-23

Their mother Adeena has spoiled Donneeka, Mercedes and Princess rotten. The price they pay for all of the luxuries that come with working in the company Adeena started is that she meddles endlessly in each of their lives.  She holds the key to each of the condos they are living in and that she is paying for and doesn't hesitate to use the keys freely. After one of her vivid dreams that one of the girls will marry in December - a mere few months away - she sets about trying to set the oldest Donneeka up with Braxton. <br /> <br />Braxton is a guy from their old neighborhood, who was a nerd but has grown up into a handsome man that knows what he wants and isn't afraid to go after it.  Though it's clear that Braxton has a serious interest in Donneeka, she fights any attempts on his part or on her mother's part to push them into a relationship.  She has become fed up with her mother and won't fall for her mother choosing her future husband.  The relationship between Donneeka and her mothers and sisters is the consummate love/hate relationship.  Though the girls all clearly love their mother, her meddling is incessant.  Many of the interactions between them are downright laugh-out loud humorous at times.  At other times, they are too over the top. This is very evident in the revealing of family secrets some of them are harboring. <br /> <br />My major complaint with \\"Too Much Drama\\" is that each of the daughters is too one-dimensional.  Donneeka is the good girl that shows independence, Mercedes is the brat that can't agree with anything her Mother says and Princess is the antithesis of Mercedes and goes along with everything Mother says. <br /> <br />The part of the story that draws you in is the relationship between Donneeka and Braxton.  Though her spoiled side comes out in full force in her initial interactions with him as she pulls every childish prank in the book to ward off her growing affections for him, over time she relishes her feelings for him. Watching her fight off her feelings for Braxton so that her mother doesn't \\"win\\" once again started out fun, but dragged on a bit too long.	2005-05-22

At the start of this tale, Lacie is facing a change on her job as her boss has moved on.  Lacie literally runs into her new boss, Anthony Douglas (Tony), on the elevator.  The physical attraction between them is obvious, yet Lacie is not interested in pursuing her instant attraction with her Caucasian boss. <br /> <br />Before things begin to develop beyond the physical for Lacie and Tony, Lacie has a second encounter with a man she'd briefly met in a nightclub.  Joe, a wealthy and handsome African American male, happens also to be good friends with Tony. As Joe represents - on paper at least - all that Lacie has ever wanted in a man, she fights her physical attraction to Tony and begins to pursue a relationship with Joe.  The trouble comes when the initial attraction between Tony and Lacie won't die a quiet death.  Lacie soon begins to wonder if she'd dare cross the \\"color line\\". <br /> <br />The great majority of the book deals with Lacie fighting a battle of wills with her self.   Throughout the story, other characters are introduced with their own challenges. The side stories involving Lacie's pregnant teenaged sister and embattled mother, Lacie's best friend Dawn and finally her neighbor are not developed to any degree of satisfaction. I never came to fully understand the root of her mother's bitterness and detachment.  At the end of the book, I still wanted to know why/how Dawn ended up in the situation she did. Details of each of these characters are introduced and skimmed over, but never developed enough to satisfy me as a reader.  In this case, the sub-plots only become distractions. <br /> <br />The author spends most of the book trying to address the tension Lacie faces due to her competing interests in Tony and Joe.  However, by the time Lacie confronts her feelings for Tony (in the last 10% of the book), it just felt like it was too little too late.  The author wrapped up the most intriguing part of this story - the confrontation - in the last few pages.  All in all, I felt that all the makings of a compelling story where in place, but the intrigue and interest were not fully realized. In the end, it was a very unsatisfying culmination of a disjointed story.	2005-05-17

Valerie and John's marriage is in serious trouble.  They've grown apart due to a number of stresses including infertility. Despite the fact that they are strong Christians, their relationship is dying a fast death as the emotional and physical distance between them continues to grow. <br /> <br />As she's in the park, Valerie meets a man who is a great listener, thoughtful and a Christian. Valerie soon becomes convinced that God has sent this man into her life as a second chance at true love.  The story follows Valerie as she decides if she should leave John and start anew with the new man in her life who she begins to meet in the park weekly. <br /> <br />Valerie soon begins to feel uncomfortable and struggles to know God's true will for her life. As this is a short volume, I didn't expect to be so completely fulfilled from reading this story.  Jackie King-Scott seamlessly infused the story with bible verses, sermons/presentations from Christian conferences and discussions from a small Bible study group.  Yet, not once did I feel that she was using this as a platform simply for presenting the biblical messages.  Each instance flowed perfectly with the story, yet was uplifting and inspiring to me as a reader. <br /> <br />I simply loved that the author tackled tough issues, realistically and yet held true to a Christian message.  I'm eagerly awaiting Ms. King-Scott's next novel. This is Christian fiction done right! <br />	2005-05-15

In the first of the stories of the anthology \\"Stacy's Wedding\\", wedding planner Stacy is an ultimate professional and in high demand. During the course of overseeing one impending wedding disaster, she loses her keys.   The keys are returned to her my Max, longstanding bachelor who is attending the wedding of a friend's child.  Though they don't connect at the wedding due to Stacy's skittishness about relationships, Max follows up on his interest and they are soon building a solid friendship.  Drama is introduced into the story in a number of ways.  Firstly is the presence of Vivian, a woman who attends church with Max and has had her eyes on him for some time.  A second, more distracting, story line involves both Stacy and Max's involvement in an online reading discussion group.  Their interaction in the group is not as positive as their budding romance. I found the detailed conversations of the book club an unwelcome diversion. The story was written in 1999, but could have well been written in 1959.  The characters have chemistry but often respond to each other as you would expect young teens in love to react.  It's very quaint.  This was my least favorite of the stories in this collection.    The second story \\"The Wife Degree\\" focuses on Stacy's little sister Madison, who we were introduced to in the first story.  In this story, Maddy comes face-to-face with her neighbor and childhood nemesis.  She was teased merciless by Jordan and upon seeing him again is reminded of his unkind words.  Jordan, on the other hand, regrets teasing Maddy who has become a beautiful and mature Christian woman.  Jordan and Maddy are both secretly attracted to each other. As Jordan agrees to teach Maddy to cook, supposedly to impress a secret crush, they have to decide if they can get over their past and move forward with each other. This was a cute story of two adults navigating rocky pasts. This was a nice, heartwarming tale.    In \\"Pride and Pumpernickel\\" we move from Kansas City (the site of the first two stories) to St. Louis, where Dana (Max's little sister) is working tirelessly as the general manager for a series of \\"Mom and Pop\\" bakeries.  As competition from a larger, popular bakery threatens the success of the business, the owners bring in New York City gourmet chef Ethan to revamp their menu.  Dana loves the tradition of the bakery and doesn't think a major overhaul is in order. Though they disagree on the future direction of the bakery, they both agree that there is a definitive attraction for each other.       The final tale of the anthology \\"Whole in One\\" is the story Anthony (Dana's brother) and Evette, a golf instructor.  When Anthony decides to take golf lessons to improve his game, he doesn't anticipate developing feelings for his golf teacher and fellow church member Evette.  Having been unceremoniously dumped by her fianc several months ago, Evette is gun shy of relationships.  Her relationship with God has also suffered.  As Anthony tries to get her to attend church more regularly, Evette begins to wonder if she's only an evangelistic project or if Anthony truly has feelings for her.  Their growing friendship is greatly challenged when her old fianc Justin returns to the picture after failing to make it as a golf pro.  As old feelings resurface, Evette has to decide whether to go back to the old or explore her feelings for Anthony.  This was perhaps my favorite of the all the stories in the anthology.    All of these stories emphasis the relationship both the men and women have with God and how that impacts their budding romances. There is a nice continuity from story to story with continual updates on the lives of characters introduced in earlier sections. These stories have a 19th century feel to them in many ways, with many of the characters having a certain wide-eyed innocence about them. Other than the rough start of the first story, I found each additional story more satisfying.    In my opinion, Ms. Ford's \\"Flippin' the Script\\" is a much more enjoyable, modern day romance story.  Having read \\"Flippin\\" as my first introduction to her work, I can now see how her writing has grown. I'd recommend reading it.	2005-05-09

In \\"Where there's smoke\\" we experience the reunion of Thais and Lucien 15 years after they were married for a few hours in Las Vegas.  They married in a Las Vegas wedding after a few days of a fast and furious romance.  Thais suffered from severe \\"morning after\\" regrets and quickly had the marriage annulled. <br /> <br />Now fifteen years later, they meet again as Lucien attempts to help a little girl who has become separate from her parent in a large department store.  Even as he offers to let her use his cell phone to call her Mom, he notices her physical resemblance to his lost love and ex-wife Thais. <br /> <br />In an unlikely turn, the mother of the lost girl is indeed his lost love. The feels that Thais and Lucien shared start to simmer again when they see each other.  This time however, largely due to new responsibilities and a more recent ex-husband than Lucien, Thais takes the relationship at a much slower pace. <br /> <br />Thais and Lucien are both likeable characters and Lucien's family members, who play a large role in the novel, are likeable as well. There are points where Thais's deference to the manipulations of her 11 year old daughter and ex-husband are frustrating, not to mention predictable.  Also in spots the detail given about extraneous characters is overwhelming - e.g. in one description of a dinner party the author spends far too many words and pages describing a large number of the people in attendance.  If you've read previous novels involving the characters maybe the details will appeal to you, otherwise it is extremely distracting. <br /> <br />All in all this was a warm and fuzzy story about long lost loves reunited.  A bit unlikely in parts, but large satisfying nonetheless.	2005-05-02

These two women are dedicated to having a closer walk with Christ and serve as accountability and prayer partners, as well running buddies. Anisha has been dateless a year and a half (78 weeks to be exact).  In the meantime, she and Sherri have been preparing themselves for the man God intends for them by actively participating in their church's singles ministry and preparing a list of dating \\"commandments\\".  Shortly into the novel, a good friend of Anisha's who is also a dedicated church member seems to be turning up the heat on their friendship.  Before long, Anisha and Tyson seem well on the path to a solid relationship.  Along the way, Anisha's adherence to her \\"commandments\\" and her dedication to a closer walk with Christ will be severely tested.  Through it all Anisha and Sherri's friendship and her intimate \\"conversations\\" with the Holy Spirit are infused into her path.    While watching the advancements in Anisha's life, Sherri's facing some changes of her own. Also waiting for \\"Mr. Right\\", Sherri faces some tough choices about her standards for men.  She has to question her values for the physical vs. spiritual and is making these tough decisions in front of her roommates, who are childhood friends who have not come to know Christ in the intimate way that she and Anisha have.  Sherri will face tough choices as she first and foremost tries to make the right decisions for herself, even as she presents a close, personal witness to her friends.    Anisha and Sherri change drastically throughout the novel, but through it all their friendship never wavers.  This is a good, uplifting book for Christian singles and a good inspiring read for all.    I'm eagerly awaiting Ms. Mccollors next novel.	2005-05-02

If you love the music of Jill Scott for its beautifully personal and uplifting content, you'll simply devour these nearly 150 pages of her poems. <br /> <br />Jill has often said that she's kept written journals for years.  As many of Jill's song lyrics read like poems to me (and I dearly love them), I was not surprised to find myself deeply engrossed in Jill's accounts of life and love in this compilation. <br /> <br />Jill's writings unapologetically hold love up and examine, admire and venerate it. Her poems also touch on issues of friendship and family. <br /> <br />I've known since I heard the first song from her very first album that Jill was not just another singer, but a poet who happens to possess and beautiful voice and undeniable music talent. Now she is not only an accomplished poet, but a published one.  It speaks so highly of her talent and her very nature that the likes of Sonia Sanchez and Maya Angelou have recognized the power of her gift and her loving, intelligent spirit. <br /> <br />Never a big fan of audio books, I'm dying for the audio version of this collection!!!	2005-04-28

When she meets the twin of her best friend's husband at their wedding, she is instantly turned off by his cocky approach to flirting with her.  A self-recognized woman magnet Deshawn is shocked when Anika gives him a stinging retort and leaves him rejected.    Deshawn vows to get Anika just where he wants her.  As Deshawn tries to get with Anika and faces a roadblock at each turn, he turns up the charm.  Soon it's no longer just a game as he develops true feelings for her.  Just as Anika starts to warm up to him, she finds out that he was initially running a game on her and splits.    In addition to the secrets that Anika is hiding about her past, Deshawn's `betrayal' has left him with a steep uphill battle to showing Anika that he truly wants her in more ways than one.    The chemistry between Anika and Deshawn is undeniable and the characters ring true.  The details of Anika's past adds a bit of mystery/drama that is well described and well weaved into the story without becoming too much of a distraction.  This is a fairly long book and this is due in great part to there being a lot included about the love of Anika's best friend Chloe and her husband Devon, who is also Deshawn's twin.  Readers who read Niobia Bryant's previous novel will likely be very happy to catch up on the story of Chloe and Devon.    Having not read the first installment, the book was a bit long and drawn out in places to me, but all in all a very compelling and well rounded novel.	2005-04-27

For such a short novel it spans 20+ years starting from the time Malena lost her Dad as an 8-year old.  The book follows her as she tries to understand life and death and seeks to build a relationship with the God that was a dear friend to her father. Grant is the younger boy that she has known since he was just a pest in the Sunday School class in which she helped out. Grant is a God fearing man that proclaims Malena as his future wife at the ripe old age of 10. His role in her life is peripheral throughout most of the story, but comes center stage in the latter third. Throughout the novel, Malena stumbles along the way, but ultimately finds a path to the life that God intended for her.   <br /> <br />The style of the book draws you in at times, when it feels Malena is speaking to you as a girlfriend would over coffee or tea.  Though the God-fearing, Malena-loving Grant was an admirable character, I kept wishing I knew more about him. The chapters that interjected his voice didn't give me any greater insight into him as an individual.	2005-04-19

The column, which serves as the book title, is written by a single Christian woman who offers advice to her readers.  The premise of the anthology is that each single woman that serves as the columnist soon finds herself in the in danger of losing her maiden status and thus her job as columnist. <br /> <br />All are satisfying, if rushed, stories in which three of the ladies fine themselves actually communicating with there potential Romeo through the column.  One of the things I had to keep reminding myself was that this was a modern story (2002 publication date).  All of the stories could have well been written in thirty years ago based on the interactions between the characters and the dialogue.  This was neither good, nor bad, in my eyes - just something that kept occurring to me. <br /> <br />It will satisfy those looking for a Christian romance book that holds true to the strictest of Christian principles in regards to the romantic interactions between the characters. <br />	2005-04-18

My Fine Lady was the book I liked the least.  The book is based on Bernard Shaw's play \\"Pygmalion\\" and its adaptation \\"My Fair Lady\\" both of which I adore.  At best, Ms. Joe's adaptation is a mixed bag.  <br /> <br />My Fine Lady is based on the story of Imani, the daughter of two musicians - her deceased singer mother and her musician father who never made it big.  Her father forces her to learn piano.  When she resists, he recruits a local foster child Taz to help her learn in return for feeding the ever-hungry Taz. <br /> <br />As young adults, Taz and Imani become more than friends.  They are dating and Taz is serving as the producer of the now aspiring rapper Imani. <br /> <br />The ode to Pygmalion comes when a local professor decides to train Imani in classical jazz music to reinforce his musing that music can change one's life.  The story from there is predictable - Imani feels torn between her old life with Taz and the promise of a new life with Professor Hopson.  The story plays out much as expected. <br /> <br />The most frustrating part about this book is that it swings wildly between intended profound phrasings in the descriptions of characters and their motivations, less-than-inspired colloquial dialogue of Imani and friends and stereotypical upper-class dialogue from Professor Hopson.  These switches were not weaved together well and were abrupt and disruptive to the story.  I understand what the author intended, but wasn't overly impressed with the execution. This feeling extended to the inclusion of provocative beauty shop conversations reminiscent of those that caused such great backlash against the movie \\"Barbershop\\".  Such inclusions only added to my frustration with the novel.	2005-04-12
US	42566380	RDH2GGFN8UJ6T	0743475542	357461981	Such a Girl: A Novel	Books	3	3	3	N	N	I'm persuaded - it's a nice adaptation.	I picked up this book because of its description as being loosely based on Jane Austen's Persuasion.  I happen to like Austen originals, as well as movies and books based on her works. This was no exception. \\"Such A Girl\\" is the conduit for Kendall Stark's life story. Almost a decade ago while in college, Kendall broke up with her love Jack Sullivan because her upwardly mobile college friends saw him as someone going nowhere FAST.  Jack was a loafer, but one who was determined to enjoy life even if things like classes got in the way. After many breakup-to-makeup periods, Kendall walked out of his life and didn't look back.    Now she's living a life that passes as satisfying.  She's a 31-year hotel telephone operator who lives with one of her aforementioned college friends, now an aspiring writer who works as a waiter.  When Jack walks into her hotel one day, she's hit right in the fast with her unresolved history.  Jack is now a successful owner of a beer manufacturing company.  It seems that Jack is living the life that Kendall and her friends were struggling to attain years ago.  Though they missed the mark, Jack is sitting pretty - with a fiance to boot.  Kendall, who is involved in an affair with a married man, must face her lingering feelings for Jack as she struggles to understand what Jack is doing in \\"her\\" hotel.    It's a nice adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion with all the social commentary on the differences in classes and love lost due to superficial reasons.  I enjoyed the novel.  My only criticism is that the tales of Kendall's life as an operator and her interactions with co-workers and neighbors were often too many and too detailed for me. I was particularly distracted by her ongoing conflicts with her neighbors, which distracted from the overall flow of the novel at times.  It was annoying, but it didn't interfere greatly with my overall enjoyment of the story and its underlying romantic themes.	2005-04-08

Books	4	35	35	N	Y	Good, pure Christian fiction and good fun	This novel is based on three single friends who are trying to live their lives completely dedicated to Christ.  Two of them Michelle and Sandy are dealing with relationship issues.  Michelle is more progressed in her Christian walk, but has had a tough time finding the man intended for her.  Her most recent relationship with a man from her church hits a few bumps in the road during the book.  We see her applying the word of God to her life as she tries to walk completed in the Spirit and not in her own flesh. <br /> <br />Sandy is a relatively new convert dealing with the struggles of leaving behind her worldly ways and her old approach to relationships. She's desperately seeking a Christian mate...to the point that she makes some missteps along the way.  As we follow Sandy, we wonder if she'll be able to stop looking behind and look completely forward towards her Savior. <br /> <br />The third of the friends, Liz, is called to the ministry as an evangelist.  She is sold out to God and has little patience for the likes of Sandy, who appear to have one foot in the church and one in the world.  Liz's bigger problem is dealing with her Mom, who at 45 is living a wild and free single life. <br /> <br />As we see the friendship of these women sustain them in their Christian walk, and see them each deal with the issues in their lives - we see them living according to the Word of God, in prayer and in scripture (both of which are used freely in the text). <br /> <br />The book is composed of chapters that bounce back and forth between the lives of these women.  The ending is one that wraps everything up nicely with a big pretty bow. It is a nice story for anyone looking for Christian fiction that strictly adheres to the word of God. <br /> <br />Although a bit predictable at times, I give the book 4 stars for a valiant first effort and for being a book based strictly on Christian principles. <br />	2005-04-03

This was a fun romantic story with lots of interesting supporting characters.  At the heart of the story is Sabrina.  She is a sweet, single Christian who is looking for positive changes in her life and her walk with Christ for the fast approaching New Year.  One of those things she hopes will change is her frustrating relationship with her boss, talk-show host and diva extraordinaire Darci.  Sabrina's convinced that Darci is standing in the way of the promotion that she deserves. In addition to a few other changes like losing weight and staying far away from distracting romantic relationships, Sabrina is sure that making these changes will lead her to the more fulfilling life she wants <br /> <br />The interesting twist of this story enters when Darci mistakenly gets a hold of Sabrina's New Year's resolution list.  Having become suspicious that her ex and the show's producer Avery has a burgeoning interest in Sabrina, Darci decides to make a deal with Sabrina that will hold her to her resolutions and keep Sabrina away from Avery in the process.  The promise of getting the promotion and financial gain that she desperately wants is just too much for Sabrina to turn away from.  So she decides to participate in Darci's scheme - in front of television cameras no less as Darci decides to track the progression of Sabrina's New Year's resolution for a ratings boost on her talk show. <br /> <br />Sabrina's journey is fascinating - even as she starts to kick herself for swearing off romance - especially as Avery is looking better and better. <br /> <br />Ms. Ford's writing blends humor, drama and romance very well.  The stories that develop about Darci and others only add to the interest in the main story line surrounding Sabrina, Avery and Darci.	2005-03-31

Lincoln is a handsome and witty firefighter who is looking for new thrills in his personal and professional life.  His coworker and friend Flex has a major crush on Lincoln, who is none-the-wiser about Flex's designs on him. Flex is recovering from a heartbreaking 10-year long romance and the opportunity to be with someone as fascinating and caring as Lincoln intrigues him - even though he's not sure Lincoln swings his way. <br /> <br />When Lincoln meets Flex's sister Peyton completely independently of his acquaintance with Flex, the self-proclaimed ladies man Lincoln falls for her hook, line, and sinker. Peyton, who is gun shy of relationships due to past failures and abuses, is less sure that embarking on a journey with Lincoln is in her immediate future. <br /> <br />The interesting departure from the normal \\"boy-meets-girl\\" routine comes when Flex is invited to a family gather both by the hopeful Flex and the quickly reconsidering Peyton.  At times humorous, blatantly romantic and full of family drama thanks to Peyton and Flex's four other sisters, this book sucked me in for a thrilling ride from page 1!  It was a ride I thoroughly enjoyed.  I'm going to take a second look at some of Ms. Byrd's previous novels and hope dearly that I'll see some of the characters from this book again.	2005-03-30

In this, Alicia and Adam's story, we get to see the journey from a deep friendship into a meaningful romantic relationship.    Friends since graduate school and business partners for years, Alicia and Adam have been fighting off the romantic feelings that they harbor for each other for a decade.  As they each come to realize the true depths of their feelings for each other, we see their transformations both physically and emotionally.    Added to the delightfully rich story are more tales of the ongoing Cochran/Deveraux family saga that is a common thread in Ms. Schuster's novels.  It's wonderful because we get to catch up with old characters like Donnie and his lady love, while getting a glimpse into the present and future of the Cochran/Deveraux clan.  We also meet new characters such as Alicia's brothers who I hope will appear in future novels of Ms. Schuster.    Ms. Schuster's novels are keepers and \\"Something to talk about\\" doesn't disappoint.  Although you might enjoy it more if you've read previous novels that introduce the characters, once you read it you'll be left breathlessly awaiting Ms. Schuster's next foray into the Cochran/Deveraux family.	2005-03-27

Two, hard-working single women in their thirties, they are facing the challenges of balancing careers and personal lives with the reality of being single at their age. <br /> <br />Maya's hanging on to a man whose no good, but they've been together for so long it's hard for her to let go.

There is a lot of drama and many twists-and-turns in Maya's story! <br /> <br />Ashley on the other hand has pretty much given up on men and as she deals with being single and childless at 35 decides to look into alternative options for becoming a mother. In the midst of all of this, she goes on a mercy blind date with Kevin, a guy her mother has been pushing down her throat, just to get Mom off her back. It's a treat to follow her story as she tries to decide whether modern medicine or old-fashioned love will be the answer to her life's dream. <br /> <br />One of my few complaints about this book was that the ending was too rushed and you'll wish there was more focus on Ashley's quest for love. <br />	2005-03-26

Some are facing the everyday challenges of bad body images and bad relationships - including one with a proverbial \\"bad boy\\" and one with a married man. Others are dealing with their lack of time to take care of themselves, while taking care of everyone else. One is even questioning her sexuality. They face these challenges together thanks to having been united through the common challenge of facing their thirtieth birthdays.

In Arabesque's \\"To Mom, With Love\\" we are treated to the stories of authors Deirdre Savoy, Jacquelin Thomas, and Karen White-Owens as they explore the lives and loves of three single mothers.  The unifying theme of the anthology is based on a local radio station's Mother's Day Makeover/Spa Day/Blind Date Contest for single mothers.  In each story, the child of the single mother submits a letter to radio show host Alonzo Clark on why their mother is deserving to win the contest.      Deirdre Savoy's tale focuses on Clark himself, who has become the target of the son of a single mother working in his building.  This is an interesting tale, with a classic romance story happy-ending.      The second story of the anthology focuses on a divorced couple.  The tale of the couple and their disabled, teenage son is a potential tear jerker, but never truly takes off and fulfills its potential.  This was the weakest story in a lighthearted, fun anthology.    In the final story by Karen White-Owens, we see two scheming kids team up to get their mom, a caring schoolteacher, and dad, an overworked lawyer, together. This story was delightful.    Based on the strength of Savoy and White-Owen's stories, I would recommend this as an enjoyable Mother's Day read.	2005-03-24

This meeting is brief and after ushering Porter to safety, Lenora disappears in the crowd. <br /> <br />They meet again when Lenora, also a reporter and African American, accepts a job at the same newspaper for which Porter works.

Porter is convinced that Lenora is the one for him and tries to help alleviate her fears.  They face many uncertainties about their future based on the racism they encounter. <br /> <br />Many of the challenges they face, however, are based on their own preconceptions and misconceptions about each other. And Lenora's stubbornness and insecurities about her involvement in an interracial relationship. <br /> <br />This was a relatively interesting story, which at times was impeded by Lenora's skepticism and failure to stand up for what she wanted.  In the end though I felt it was a realistic portrayal of the ups and downs that might be faced by an interracial couple in America. <br /> <br />Ms. McLarin deserves credit from writing a well-rounded story about the challenges and joys faced by an interracial couple.	2005-03-24

As love blossoms through the mail for a radio-show host and her doting fan, we see her struggle with past disappointments as she struggles to trust that the affection shared through words is real. <br /> <br />In the final story by Watson, we see a case of mistaken identity turn to romance when a man whose purpose it is to relay that his irresponsible friend will not show up for a blind date becomes enamored with lady in waiting. The major tension arises when instead of revealing his true identity he assumes the identity of his missing-in-action friend.  When the truth comes out, will his potential lady love be able to forgive him. <br /> <br />Although a bit whimsical in places, all in all this is a story that will appeal to the true romantics at heart.  This is a great read for a lazy summer day or a rainy afternoon.  It is also one I'll revisit!	2005-03-23

In Shades and Shadows, we meet Jade who has spent the last 4 years trying to recover from an abusive marriage.  She is the principal teacher and owner of her own dance studio. She has taken a break from relationships and kept her distance from men until she meets Noel.  Noel has become a \\"player\\" after being hurt by the woman the he loved and hope would bear his children.  He's a committed bachelor until the day he arrives at Jade's school to pick up his niece. <br /> <br />Their love affair starts off hot and heavy, but slows to a fun, yet leisurely pace as Noel realizes the hurt that Jade is hiding.  Not wanting to scare her off, they begin a chemistry-laden romance as they take their time to get to know each other better.  This portion of the book is fun to experience as a reader.  Things seem to be going well until Jade's abusive ex-husband resurfaces and odd things begin to happen.  This all culminates in Noel being attacked with the entire suspicion landing on Peter. <br /> <br />This is clearly a romance with a secondary story of some mystery/intrigue.  The intrigue portion is not a major focus of the author in terms of character/storyline development.  However, Noel and Jades relationship and the interactions between the two of them and their friends and family are well-developed enough to provide a very enjoyable read.	2005-03-21

In this follow-up to \\"Ladies in Waiting\\", Hudson-Smith takes a continuing look at the drama of that comes from living lives while separated from loved ones who are imprisoned.  In this story, the author looks at the issue from the male point of view as we see one of the protagonists from her first book, Rev. Jesse Covington, forming a self-support group for men separated from their wives and girlfriends who have been incarcerated.  Inspired by the work of the women's support group that was so helpful to his wife during his incarceration for a crime of which he was falsely accused, Rev. Covington attempts to help a group of men dealing with the imprisonment of their female mates.  An interesting mix of stories and Hudson-Smith's engaging writing style, which made \\"Ladies in Waiting\\" a popular and interesting tale, carries the novel nicely in this treatment.    It's interesting to see this story told from the male-point-of-view after having seen the female side in the first novel.  This is an enjoyable tale that will be most fully enjoyed by those who read the first novel.    A true fan of Christian fiction, I thought this book nicely balanced the challenges that one faces in life, with the power one's christian beliefs has to help one face those challenges.	2005-03-21

Here we experience the story of Devin Prescott, who we first got a glimpse of in Bette Ford's \\"Unforgettable\\", and Brynne.  They fell quickly and deeply in love a few years before the setting of this story.  After a minor argument, Brynne runs away and Devin never hears from her again, leaving him extremely hurt and confused.  Devin's pride got in his way of seeking her out, while a tragic secret has kept Brynne away from anything associated with her painful past, including Devin.  After being dragged to a party by a friend, Brynne unexpectedly comes face to face with Devin and her past.  As secrets unfold, Brynne and Devine must decide if their brief but intense love affair will be rekindled.   <br /> <br />Getting a chance to catch up with character's from Ford's previous novel including Anna and Gavin Mathis and all the lovable characters in the Prescott family was a like a long overdue family reunion. Completely apart from the riches, theirs is a family many would long to have.  Only minor issues with the book kept me from giving it five stars.  This includes the author's repetitive use of some phrases - for example I thought if I read about Devin clenching his jaw as if he was grinding his teeth once more I would scream - and also the fact the book gets rather slow in parts and then climaxes to an end that felt a bit rushed.  All in all, I'm a big Bette Ford fan and am pleased with her continuation of the Prescott saga.  I look forward to her next installment and would highly recommend this story to anyone looking for a satisfying romantic read. <br /> <br />Also if you haven't read the story of Anna Prescott and Gavin Mathis in \\"Unforgettable\\" I'd recommend that as a very pleasant read as well.	2005-03-20

I was waiting for the sequel to Ms. Lee's \\"All That and a Bag of Chips\\" with some anticipation.  Unfortunately in this continuation of the Venice/Jarvis/Craig saga, we pretty much see more of the same.  Venice has gone back to the familiar with her high school sweetheart Jarvis and Craig is struggling to ever love so deeply again.  This could have been a great jumping off point for a more mature novel that explored the adult life of these characters. <br /> <br />Instead, we get pretty much more of the same drama and self-centered Venice that we saw in the first novel. This time it's not as captivating.  You'd expect to see the characters develop emotionally and explore a different set of issues perhaps...The first time the author evoked emotions of annoyance in me in regards to Venice.

Suffice it to say this is just not for me.    In this erotica-based story of three sisters - Harmony, Bryce, and Lucinda (a.k.a. Lucky) Whitfield - Zane tells of their escapades and romantic romps (in vivid, exhausting detail) and sisterly spats and interactions.  They are a fairly lively and interesting bunch, but their interactions are reduced to tales of mating and hating.  Maybe I'm a boring prude, but so much of the tale seems so far away from my reality and lacking the good cohesive drama and character-building that I adore that I just couldn't get invested in this book on any level.    With so many reading alternatives these days, I have crossed Zane off my list of good reads. I like something a bit more uplifting and a better-rounded read.    If you like hardcore erotica fiction that is most tales of sexual escapades with limited distractions from a good storyline, I'm sure you'll love it.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.	2005-03-17

Pre-reading is something that I always do as I find that some books targeted to a certain age range are not something that he parents or I would want her to read.  The story of Maizon, a young African American girl who grew up in the big city and is now away at a predominantly white boarding school, is just charming to say the least.   <br /> <br />Maizon is facing all of the normal fears of being away from home for the first time.  The story explores the issues of dealing with race and class that come with her unique situation. Ms. Woodson creates a story full of rich dialogue and descriptions that tell a \\"true-to-life\\" story of a young girl in Maizon's situation. <br /> <br />Kudos to Ms. Woodson for creating a story that one would be proud for their youngsters to read. <br /> <br />I'd recommend all of the books in the trilogy.	2005-03-17

Here we see the girls developing into teenagers and exploring the new boundaries of their friendship after major changes in the family of Margaret and Maizon's less than triumphant return from a sojourn in a private, predominantly white boarding school. The arrival of a new girl on their block also inserts challenges in their evolving friendship. <br /> <br />Ms. Woodson has done it again.

I picked up this book at an airport bookstore after reading the first few lines.  It was a lovely comedic start to a book about relationships, the drama therin, with a touch of mystery. Alex Powel,the lead character and journalist, has interesting perspectives on life.  Her friendship with Signe (still can't pronounce it!), a fun but high maintenace kind of girl adds interesting dialogue to a story billed as a mystery, but truly much more of a romance/drama with a side of suspense.  The romance enters when Alex and her journalist friend Paul Butler discover that an editor colleague Everett \\"Ev\\" Carson, described most aptly as a mostly loveable cad, is late to accept a National Black Journalist Association award because he's been murdered.  The suspense arises as Alex and Paul try to decipher which of Ev's enemies and women-done-wrong might be involved.  Once Alex and Paul start traveling together to unravel this mystery the focus of the story is much more on the romantic tension between them than the suspense around Ev's death. <br /> <br />If you like a mixture of relationship drama with a bit of mystery, you'll love Bates' story and really like the witty Alex.  If you're looking for hardcore mystery, this might not quash your appetite. <br /> <br />All in all though, I definitely say give it a try.	2005-03-16

This anthology focuses on the lives and romances of four women from the same community of Red Oaks in Georgia.  This in itself makes for a nice continuity that is not often found in anthologies.  The reappearance of favorite characters, such as Mother Maybelle, from story to story is pleasant. The first of the stories was rather good.  It moved at an enjoyable pace and had two compelling leads.  The third was just okay. The last two stories were slow-moving and not very enjoyable, or realistic, in my opinion.    All of the stories are variations of the classic \\"boy-meets-girl\\" romance.  However, in each of these stories one the characters is a member of the Red Oaks Community Church. As such there are christian influences infused throughout the anthology. Many of the relationships lead to both parties becoming involved in the church. This is not to suggest that this is a christian fiction book however.   This is where some readers, including myself to a certain degree, will meet with disappointment.  I would rather described this book as pure romance with christian and/or spiritual overtones.  The title, bookcover, and synopses of the stories seem geared to reach a christian audience.  However, the book is heavy on intimacy and it occurs both in and outside of traditional christian boundaries.  This would be fine in a christian novel if used to teach a story, but often the christian role models in the anthology are involved in such behavior and speak of it openly as acceptable.  This includes joking of such matters with bold humor with church mothers and the pastor's wife!  I'm certain that this will not sit well with many picking up the book for a good, pure chrisian fiction experience.    Summarily, this is a nice romance anthology with chistian influences, but know that you are buying a classic romance collection with all the classic romance \\"bells and whistles\\".  If you are a christian fiction purist, proceed with caution.	2005-03-16

After receiving this anthology, I realized that I'd read each of these books almost 10 years ago as single novels.  Some of the first to debut from then Pinnacle's line of Arabesque novels.  The sad part is that the way Af-Am literature (and my own self for that matter) has developed, I wasn't nearly as enthralled by these stories as I was 10 years before.    Serenade, originally a 1994 release by Sandra Kitt, tells the story of Alexandra and Parker.

Passion reignites between the two.  Although Alexandra's younger sister, a spoiled brat at the least, presents a formidable obstacle for these two to resume their relationship where it was abort 10 years ago, the story tells of their path back to each other.

I first read \\"Forever Yours\\" when it was released in 1994. One of the first in the line of Arabesque novels (then published by Pinnacle). The story of Kane and Victoria was intriguing. Victoria, a woman who has been scorned many times, refuses to be hurt by love again.  After her grandmother insists that she marry or lose her beloved business due to Victoria's inability to repay a well-timed loan from her grandmother, Victoria takes matters into her own hands and looks for a husband-for-hire.

This story of Toxy and Antoine is a solid, stand alone sequel to one of the short stories in Bacon and Daniels first effort \\"Luvalwayz\\". Here we see Roxy's character developed as she goes on a relationship journey with Antoine.  At times Roxy is a spoiled brat and wants things her way or the highway. Several times during my reading of this book I was completely annoyed with Roxy as she certainly was not as fully invested in the success of the relationship as Antoine.  The power of a character to induce such feelings in a reader speaks well for the author, or in this case authors.  Antoine's relationship with his best friend Nikki, who doesn't harbor wonderful feelings for Roxy and in fact is quite suspicious of her intentions towards Antoine, adds nice tension to the main story line at times and is distracting at others as it seeks to address Nikki's difficulties with life as a lesbian. <br /> <br />All in all the best thing I have to say about this book which was good, but not the best book I've read, is that the two authors write seamlessly as one.

I've read it twice in fact and keep it in my collections of favorites that I come back to reread when I'm between new prospects. <br /> <br />Noire and Innocent's story spoke to me in many ways. They are both black people living in America but have very different stories.  I see Noire as a \\"reluctant buppie\\" who would never admit to such in public and in fact slight despises those she views as \\"true\\" buppies.  Rather, she's a graduate student who identifies herself as an intellectual who is in touch with the cause of the common man.  <br /> <br />Innocent, an Ivy League educated, self-proclaimed buppie from the Ivory Coast wears his success as a black man in corporate America with ease and pride.  Upon meeting at a book reading, their journey together begins.  The story focuses a lot on their differences, oft times more perceived than real, due to their academic versus corporate realities.  The parts that fascinated me more were the conflicts that came about due to their cultural differences.  So often Africans and African Americans expect they'll get along simply because they look at each other and see someone who looks like them.  Quite simply, however, the cultural divide is often great and we see nicely described evidence of that in Ms. Turnipseed's debut effort. <br /> <br />When I finished the book on my first reading I was a bit disappointed because the ending was a bit unexpected.  However, after living with the story for sometime, it became clear that the story from start to finish seems very real.  With its ups and downs and even its seeming diversions into the sideline, it tells a story that could have very well been one's biography or autobiography - a lyrical one that verbally satisfies in the process. <br /> <br />I would say that I wished for more substance and less description in parts, but as a debut that tells a story of black people that goes far beyond the common \\"boy-meets-girl\\" love stories that we often read and unlike some of the current \\"urban literature\\", this tale speaks to my reality and that of many others. <br /> <br /> I was proud to read \\"A Love Noire\\" and look forward to Ms. Turnipseed's next effort.	2005-03-09

Yes there is trouble out there to impede the progress of Af-Am males, Troy however only goes so far as to recognize the trouble and whine about it for 384 pages.

Each weaves a modern tale based on a biblical story.  From \\"Baby Blues\\" based on the story of Sarah and Abraham, the biblical couple having a child in their golden years, to other stories including one based on the Good Samaritan and another on Tamar, we are treated to modern day adaptation of biblical stories of old.    Perhaps because I'm a long time fan of Ms. Murray, Ms. Haley, and Ms. Thomas, I found their stories fascinating adaptations of the biblical stories. I also enjoyed Maurice Gray's \\"Traveling Mercies\\" based on the Good Samaritan.     The other two stories by the male authors were less satisfying and are the weakest parts of the anthology.  Both \\"Lust and Lies\\" by S. James Guitard and \\"Sword of the Lord\\" by Terrance Johnson were largely unsatisfying stories to me. Both of these stories had underdeveloped story lines and characters.  At times \\"Lust and Lies\\" was very difficult to follow because of the lack of development and it was very hard to feel any connection to the characters whose actions and motivations were befuddling at best.  \\"Sword of the Lord\\" similarly suffered from the failure of the author to develop the characters to the point that you feel invested in the story and its outcome.    Summarily, many of the stories leave you wanting more and wishing the authors had a bit more time to develop the storyline and characters, but that is always a hard balance in short story format.    Even given my criticisms I must say that one of the greatest aspects of this anthology is that it provides pure Christian lessons without sugarcoating the impacts of walking outside of God's will.  You definitely get a message from each of these stories that encourage dependence upon God and walking in His will.    If you are looking for Christian Fiction that holds true to core Christian principles while providing an entertaining read, I'd recommend this anthology.	2005-03-08

Until she is rear-ended by Michael.  The love story begins and the ups and downs of a relationship, in addition to dealing with her health issues are described in great detail.  The relationship is interesting, as is her struggle with friendships and illness.  I adored the storyline, however I love stories with dialogue.  Dialogue makes a story come alive.  This story is told in journal format.  Sometimes it reads like an author's notes and reflections that should have been fleshed out with dialogue. <br /> <br />Because the storyline is good, I'd recommend it with only slight reservations.	2005-03-01
