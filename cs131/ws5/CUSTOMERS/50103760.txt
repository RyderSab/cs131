Whether the author's goal was to champion the rights of the individual and thereby weaken the power of the state, or simply to get occultists to join the NRA, is a matter open to debate. Nonetheless, it is an interesting book.<br /><br />Mr. Wasserman advocates a peculiar philosophy in \\"The Slaves Shall Serve\\", blending gun control statistics and the facts of Waco and Ruby Ridge with the teachings of Aleister Crowley and the Libertarian Party to advance the idea that the individual is at the very least sovereign, if not god. Few readers of this book would agree with the author on every point on religion and politics, but his views are logically consistent and worthy of consideration. Additionally, Mr. Wasserman offers valuable and penetrating insight into the minds of the 9/11 hijackers with his analysis of militant Islam.<br /><br />My only complaint about this book is that it is too short (nearly half the book could have been condensed to a page of URLs), but I suspect that the author did this on purpose, sneaking a printed copy of the U.S. Constitution into the \\"New Age\\" section of bookstores and libraries. Regardless of its shortcomings, any reader of \\"The Slaves Shall Serve\\" will be compelled to draw two conclusions - that the rights of the individual are under attack from enemies both foreign and domestic, and that these liberties are worth fighting for - and that is reason enough for me to recommend the book.	2005-01-06

Short review: If you actually know who Forrest Mims is, then you (and/or one of your geeky friends) will absolutely love this book.<br />Slightly longer review: This is a fun and easy-to-read book for electronics enthusiasts of all ages and skill levels, geeky or otherwise. From classic projects like the Mac-quarium and the refurbished Furby to more practical hacks like building a backup laptop power supply, you're likely to find at least one or two projects that you'll enjoy reading about... and actually doing!

This book is the spiritual heir to those ripped out and discarded pages... what makes this all the more depressing is that the author clearly had the opposite intent in mind.<br />The book is an acceptable introduction to literary themes and symbolic thinking, well-suited to budding writers and English majors; despite the publisher's claims, however, I find it neither \\"lively\\" nor \\"engaging\\" enough to gain wide appeal outside those circles. Indeed, Professor Foster seems to have written the book precisely for that audience, as he assumes a broad literary knowledge on the part of the reader, but insists on repeatedly hammering home trivial concepts (like submersion in water being symbolic of baptism) that anyone \\"well-read\\" enough to follow him should already know. This tone, and the frequent return to themes and topics already covered in great detail - oh, look, another Toni Morrison reference - make reading this book feel like an assigned task. Since there will be no quiz later, I can not recommend the book.<br />I really wanted to like this book. Professor Foster seems a charming and intelligent fellow, and I would probably enjoy taking his classes. Nonetheless, I find this dry and repetitive contribution to \\"the ur-story\\" lacking... the reader that would benefit the most from it would likely enjoy it least. The praise of the book by English professors shows that the converse is also true.	2004-04-08

I hate this book, but I regularly refer to it in need or out of boredom. I hate this book, yet somehow all the things that I detest just make me love it more.<br />In this book, Lon DuQuette (or, if you prefer, Rabbi Lamed) has produced the finest set of introductory knowledge lectures on Hermetic Qabalah in print. Only Regardie et al surpass him in scope, and only D. M. Kraig approaches him in accessibility - but the former go too far, and the latter not far enough. The metaphors may be strained, the plot devices hackneyed, and the jokes incredibly lame, but there is still no better book for confused neophytes in existence today.<br />Some have criticized this as a work of \\"Thelemic\\" Qabalah, at odds with the traditional literature on the subject. I respectfully disagree. Though the author describes himself as an apostate and a dilettante, his contributions are nonetheless valuable to students of all traditions (and his correspondences are classical, not Crowleyan). In the words of the Great Rabbi, \\"Don't worry about it!\\"<br />To sum up, any bright first-year initiate could have written this book, probably with equal clarity and better jokes. BUT NONE DID, so let us give the devil his due. 93, 418, 666 stars!	2004-04-08

Despite dealing with the four apocalyptic horsemen of the language arts - grammar, vocabulary, spelling, and punctuation - one rarely feels as if they are reading a textbook or reference manual.<br />In sum, if you are looking for a gift for a student or teacher in your life, or if you did not catch any of my somewhat deliberate errors above, then consider adding \\"Much Ado About a Lot\\" to your cart.	2004-03-25

Good salespeople are made, not born; to be successful in a sales career requires practice and training, and far more than just the video or workbook that most companies provide. To that end, there are two books that I encourage every salesperson to read - \\"Secrets of Closing the Sale\\" by Zig Ziglar and \\"The Art of Selling\\" by Tom Hopkins. With this audiobook collection, you get not only a sampling of those two master's works, but also the added benefit of hearing how they speak, when they pause, how they ask. Since selling is mostly speaking and listening, repeated observation of those skills will obviously improve your technique, don't you agree?<br />Along with Tom's urban style and Zig's southern charm, this four tape set also contains the Jewish wit of Herb Cohen and the record-setting wisdom of Joe Girard. Whether lying in bed or driving to work, anyone who earns their living by the powers of persuasion should find a time and place to learn from these four masters of the craft.	2004-03-24

In a series of short biographical vignettes, Powell looks at the lives of sixty-five historical figures that he deems heroes in this struggle, making for a fascinating and inspiring read. However, any such grouping of people is bound to spark debate, as very few of these individuals would call themselves \\"libertarian\\", nor would all libertarians be quick to claim them all as ancestors or heirs.<br />Historian Paul Johnson may sum up this book best with these words from its foreword: \\"I do not agree with all of it\\". That luminaries like Cicero and Thomas Paine belong in this canon is almost without question, but the case for Beethoven, Goya, and Robert Heinlein (among others) requires one to adopt the modern \\"big L\\" libertarian perspective in its entirety. I, for one, would prefer to see Margaret Thatcher's place in the book removed, and replaced by a section on Nelson Mandela; economic issues aside, surely most people would place the latter above the former as a champion of liberty and justice in our time.<br />Thus, the greatest weakness of this book is also its strength: it forces the reader to think, to consider what \\"liberty\\" really means. Given the state of the world today, that fact alone merits my recommendation.	2004-03-16

If instead you're searching for a deeper understanding of the philosophy of liberty, then I can suggest no better starting point.<br />The book itself is a collection of short essays from a wide range of contributors to the libertarian tradition, from political economists and philosophers (such as Locke, Mill, and Adam Smith) to some perhaps more surprising sources (like the Old Testament and the Tao Teh Ching). These essays are grouped around broad themes - &quot;individual rights&quot;, &quot;free markets&quot;, &quot;skepticism about power&quot; - certainly a boon to students, but also an aid to the casual reader. Should a particular topic or thinker pique your interest, a lengthy essay called &quot;The Literature of Liberty&quot; catalogs the sources as it closes the book.<br />Whether reading this book will convince you to join the Libertarian Party, or send money to the Cato Institute, is a matter open to debate; indeed, some critics rightly point out elements of &quot;big L&quot; Libertarianism that are at odds with &quot;small l&quot; classical liberal thought. My own hope is that reading these essays will give you not only a better understanding of the founder's intent, but also a clearer vision of a better possible future - a freer, saner world. How we get there, if we get there, remains to be seen.	2004-03-15
US	50103760	R7MI2AFWKH6XZ	0823009793	820705099	Jazz: A Crash Course	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Sound Introduction	In this short and extensively illustrated book, music reviewer Simon Adams provides an encapsulated history of a century's worth of the different music we collectively label \\"jazz\\". By definition, a crash course could only provide snippets of information on subjects worthy of whole volumes, and Adams' greatest success here is that he admits this limitation and keeps moving the story forward. Thus the reader - encouraged to become the listener - is left wanting more.<br />Another highlight of this book is its respectful but unvarnished look at the darker side of jazz: that jazz and sex have been somewhat intertwined from the beginning, and that many talented musicians destroyed their lives on booze and drugs, are facts simply presented, not sensationalized. It is clear the author would rather talk about the music, and for that we should thank him.<br />Nonetheless, the book is not perfect. For a book that claims to examine a \\"truly global musical movement\\" and \\"the shape of jazz to come\\", omitting even a passing mention of ska music is a glaring oversight. Also, the author does at times try a little too hard to be hip, with \\"club talk\\" and \\"gosh facts\\" to \\"beef up your jazz cred [at] pompous wine bars\\" and the inclusion of altogether irrelevant trivia in a timeline atop every page. Still I praise and recommend this book, and if what I see as shortcomings help sell the book to the mass market, how can I complain?	2004-03-10

In 101 concise Zen-like paragraphs, punctuated with kitschy illustrations, Marty Asher forces us to think about the hardest of all questions: namely, what makes life worth living? That the author is able to accomplish this with such brevity suggests that this book is less a novel, and more a work of art, which I highly recommend.<br />Several other reviewers have called this book depressing; I respectfully disagree. A good story is like a mirror, and what you read into it may simply be a reflection. The moral of this story, if there is one, may be to stop and smell the roses... or, in the more poignant words of the author, to learn to love in an easy, natural way. Unlike the boomer, it's not too late for you.	2004-03-06

This may say more about me than the book, of course, but if you are the sort of person who finds it difficult to think about art, let alone talk or write about it, then perhaps this will give you hope.<br />Professor Sayre starts this handbook with a simple thesis: everyone could write about art, if only they knew where to start. To prove his point, Sayre chooses pieces that most laypeople would consider indescribable (like the abstractions of Jackson Pollock) and teaches the reader, slowly but surely, how to really look at the work. With subsequent lessons on choice, composition, and color, even the most \\"non-artistic\\" thinkers will begin to see things in a different light... and then Professor Sayre will then teach you how to put those thoughts into words.<br />If you are privileged enough to attend a school where the humanities are still actively taught, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this book - your papers and grades will doubtlessly improve. But even if your chances of ever taking an art appreciation class are slim, if you have any interest in the subject at all, then I highly recommend this book.	2004-03-06

The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.&quot;<br />So begins the brilliant and controversial work of Henry Hazlitt. As it is not the purpose of this forum to debate economic theory, let me simply suggest that you obtain this book and draw your own conclusions from it. The richer understanding of trade policy, taxes and tariffs, and government regulation you will obtain from spending a lazy afternoon with this book will provide more long-term value than its price... in short, buying Economics in One Lesson is sound fiscal policy.	2003-11-07

His book focuses on direct and indirect sales techniques, the public relations strategies of celebrities from Marv Albert to Bill Clinton, and even the tactics of cult leaders (including Mary Kay).<br />While rich in both wit and scholarship, there is one thing that this book lacks: a conclusion. After spending 300 pages explaining how business, government, and the media set up their smoke and mirrors, the author offers us no alternative to sitting back and trying to enjoy the magic show, knowing full well that we are being manipulated. Some might say this was a deliberate attempt to avoid coercing the reader... my guess is that he doesn't know either.	2001-11-29

Que's &quot;Upgrading and Repairing Networks, Second Edition&quot; is written by a different author (Terry Ogletree, though it bears Scott Mueller's name in significantly larger type), and its true sequel (&quot;Upgrading and Troubleshooting Networks&quot; by Craig Zacker) is published by Osborne. One can only imagine the intrigue that gave birth to these two rival heirs, and one can only wish that such events had not taken place, as this book is far better than either of its descendents.<br />Though a few years past its prime, Craig Zacker and Paul Doyle's &quot;Upgrading and Repairing Networks&quot; remains one of the best, broadest, most authoritative and most comprehensive guides to local area networking in print. Published prior to the certification frenzy, this book was designed to teach the journeyman technician both the theory and practice needed to perform effectively in a crisis situation. Subjects covered range from \\"the stuff in every book&quot; (like the OSI model, hardware, and a plus/minus analysis of operating systems) to arcane but incredibly useful information for those new to the care and feeding of LANs (such as a chapter each on UPSes and tape drives).<br />I strongly urge beginners to the networking field to put in the extra effort necessary to get this book; its scope all but guarantees that you'll learn new and valuable information, and its tone and style make this knowledge fairly painless to obtain. Seasoned networking professionals might also consider picking this one up (especially at marketplace prices)... that is, if the copy they've relied on since 1996 has worn out.	2001-11-19

This is not a book for boot camp students or anyone cramming for an exam. This is a book for the novice - mind you, a fast-learning, computer literate novice - who has read the magazine ads that promise riches and glory for certified IT professionals and has decided to go for his or her MCSE. And it may very well be the best book ever written for that purpose.<br />In her opening words, the author writes that &quot;the first step in Microsoft certification is a good understanding of the prerequisite information. Microsoft... assumes you will acquire this information on your own&quot;. By the time you finish this book, you will have gained that understanding. Let's look inside:<br />Chapters 1-4 discuss computer hardware. They read like notes from a PC repair class, so A+ certified techs should probably skip ahead a bit.<br />Chapters 5-7 cover client operating systems, with a well-written DOS tutorial and a good overview of the Explorer.exe GUI. This is important stuff, as I've actually met an MCSE who didn't know how to FDISK.<br />Chapters 8-12 provide a good introduction to networking theory, with a brief summary of the OSI model, information on topologies and protocols, and an evaluation of the leading network operating systems.<br />Chapters 13-17 justify the &quot;MCSE&quot; on the cover, with basic details on domains, trusts, Active Directory, and resource management on NT and 2000 networks.<br />The appendices are perhaps the most valuable parts of the book for absolute beginners, with accurate answers to the review questions and comprehensive glossaries of industry terms and acronyms.<br />The bottom line: those new to the networking field NEED this book. Their instructors might also want to pick up a copy as well, because it contains excellent tables and diagrams and the physical design of the book makes it easy to scan and photocopy (just contact the publisher first). I would also highly recommend any other JumpStart books to beginners (such as ISBN 0782126448, on TCP/IP); Sybex has set a new standard with this series.ical design of the book makes it easy to scan and photocopy (just contact the publisher first).

Unlike many computer books in print, this one actually delivers.<br />The first few chapters of the book contain exactly what anyone reading this might expect to find in a book about TCP/IP: the nuclear threat history, the OSI and DOD models, the essentials of IP addressing, and so on. These lessons are written in a clear and easy to follow (if unexceptional) way, punctuated by useful illustrations done in the hackneyed style popular in computer books from the mid-to-late 1980s. (This is not meant to be harsh criticism... I've just read way too many computer books). Then, unexpectedly, somewhere around chapter seven, something magical happens.<br />Chapter 8: a discussion of subnet masks that explains the subject as effortlessly as my favorite professor. Chapter 9: a brilliant summary of name resolution. 10, 11, DNS, WINS... I'm starting to like the cartoons... OH, OK, NOW I GET IT! The book ends with an excellent chapter on IPng, which outlines the essentials of 128-bit addressing better than anything I've ever read (I only wish more was said on how proxies and NAT are effectively postponing the inevitable).<br />In summary, anyone considering a career in networking should get a copy of this book, be they a Cisco Academy student or a hardware tech that only gets to bring the sysadmin his coffee. My only complaint (and the reason for my four-star rating) is that there were a few errors in the answers to the review questions; this is an unforgivable sin for any book designed to eliminate the need for classroom instruction. (To Mr. Blank's and Sybex's credit, there is errata online at sybex.com - search for 2644). When this book gets reprinted, I'll give it six stars!	2001-11-10

Parker is a recognized expert in his field, and this book exemplifies his experience as if it were his portfolio and resume. From lessons on defining your message to practical tips on layout and the proper uses of color and type, most readers will certainly find some helpful bit of advice in this book. BUT IT ISN'T ABOUT WEB DESIGN!<br />This book contains no code, NONE, not one tag. Though there are good illustrations explaining the usefulness of tables and frames, for example, this book will not give you even the slightest hint as to how to create these elements on a page. The same can also be said of graphics. (However, the book does provide excellent insight into the subliminal impact of perforations, folds, and paper texture). And while technology marches on, this book has not - it remains a relic from the age of 28.8K modems.<br />So let us appreciate this book for what it is, a fantastic book on the fundamentals of graphic design. But readers might be better served by Parker's master work &quot;Looking Good in Print&quot; (ISBN 1566048567); its lessons apply just as well to PowerPoint and the World Wide Web. Fans of this series who actually want to make web sites might also consider &quot;Web Design for Dummies&quot;... it's about web design.	2001-11-10

It is evident that he tried to make an arcane and boring subject more lively (as all technical writers should do), and his expertise is also apparent. All the topics you would expect to see covered here have been (quite well, in fact): the ARPA and OSI models, DNS, DHCP, client configuration, security, and so forth. There's just one thing keeping me from giving this a five star review: market forces - that is, other books.<br />TCP/IP has existed for around half a century - geologic time in information technology - and quite a few excellent texts have been penned by venerable pioneers. Interest and demand have soared because of the dot-coms and Y2K, and millions of trees have given their lives to teach the world how to subnet and route. With almost limitless options available, is this really the TCP/IP book for you?<br />Engineers and admins would probably get more out of Cisco books, while programmers should stick to the classics (like Stevens' _Illustrated_). Newcomers to the industry need a book like this, but they tend to focus on certification specifics, and this book is broad and platform neutral. Fans of the Teach Yourself series with an interest in TCP/IP should certainly get this book - are you one of them?<br />Probably the best test to see if this book &quot;fits&quot; is to locate a copy (at a brick &amp; mortar or online) and read Hour 24. If you do not understand it but you laugh at the jokes, buy a copy. Otherwise, consider other options.	2001-09-17

Both the chronological and functional styles are succinctly addressed, with additional advice on preparing your resume for scanning and Internet posting. More sample resumes would have been nice, but what can you expect from a 100-page book?	2001-09-15

If you are planning to take the new A+ tests, however, and you have even the slightest bit of experience, then this book is far superior for a variety of reasons:<br />1. Better Organization. The Exam Cram is laid out in a conceptual order ideal for beginners - you start at the motherboard and gradually work outside the computer, you start at DOS and progressively upgrade to Windows 2000. But that's what the thousand page study guides are for - these books are supposed to help you CRAM for the EXAM. The Exam Notes are instead patterned directly after CompTIA's objectives, making it far easier to locate information on your weak areas when studying for the tests.<br />2. Appropriate Detail. The Exam Cram provides a scant 20 pages on networking (though it makes up 10-15% of each exam) and less on laser printers (typically, an uncomfortable area of study), but reprints almost all of the Windows 3.1 information from the first edition despite the new test objectives! In contrast, these Exam Notes contain an excellent introduction to basic networking concepts, a fully illustrated review of the EP process, and far less &quot;historical data\\".<br />3. Overall Quality. The latest version of the Exam Cram still contains an almost useless motherboard diagram, disjointed discussions of barely related technologies (see Chapter 7), and some truly unforgivable factual errors (see page 401). This book provides stark contrast with actual photos of things you should be able to visually identify, better focus on current test objectives, high accuracy, and IT EVEN COSTS LESS!<br />Coriolis produces useful study guides, but Sybex got them this time. Mr. Jones and Mr. Landes have a fine test prep product on audio cassette, but this is, in my opinion at least, the best in print.	2001-09-14

This book is an excellent fluff-free reference for MIS professionals and a fantastic learning tool for networking students. Why books twice this price (or twice this thickness) can not be this good is a question I may never answer... email Que and let me know what they say.<br />Just because it's over five years old doesn't mean it's out of date - from deconstruction of packets to lengthy expositions on protocols (TCP/IP, X.25, XNS, even AppleTalk) to a 40-step flowchart on internetwork implementation, this book is a worthy addition to any technical library. The value of the diagrams and appendices alone justifies the extra effort to get this book.<br />Mr. Miller, if you're out there, I demand a reprint!	2001-09-09

While browsing through this book, I was struck by its lack of real content. The quality and quantity of the information were essentially identical to the four page &quot;tips sheet&quot; that came with my package of resume paper. A more careful review found that the sample resumes were barely relevant to today's &quot;high-tech&quot; marketplace, and I was appalled to see duplicate cover letters used to pad the book! Two stars because of price, otherwise not recommended.	2001-09-06

The good news is that your instructor has a good head on his/her shoulders, because this is actually a very useful lab manual. It is not the best choice for self-study (as most home networks seldom have two NetWare and two NT servers), but it is a fantastic resource in a classroom environment, because THE LABS PREPARE YOU FOR THE REAL WORLD.

Thankfully, books like this one exist... you provide the coal (your education and experience), and Lewis and Corwin will fashion it into a diamond (one gem of a resume!).<br />The first 80 pages of the book are packed with excellent advice on resume and cover letter writing, interviewing, and job hunting. Some of their methods are unfashionable in the current job marketplace (they focus strictly on the chronological resume format, for example, and always include a &quot;references available&quot; statement), but it's generally a bad idea for anyone new to anything to break with tradition. The rest of the book contains 100 sample resumes, nicely categorized by market segment and job description.<br />Bottom line: if you're looking for a job in sales, marketing, or management, then you can't afford to miss this book.	2001-08-21

I only wish it was current, for the modern marketplace needs more books like it.<br />Rather than focus on a particular vendor's products or certification exam, the authors explain the big picture of client/server networking in an acronym-rich format that only a &quot;big iron&quot; programmer could love. Exhaustive coverage of database systems, groupware, and transaction processing are also presented, elaborated on by silly cartoons reminiscent of Greg Perry's early work.<br />Alas, times have changed. &quot;Cairo&quot; is obsolete now, and OS/2 did not provide the panacea to every client/server ill. I would strongly suggest that any reader of this review obtain a copy of the much newer third edition (ISBN: 0471316156). I certainly will.	2001-08-14

The author writes with uncommon clarity and the material is comprehensive (if occasionally lacking in detail), focusing not only on technology but also on the &quot;soft skills&quot; and best practices of network technicians, the sorts of things that get and keep you employed. Any novice to the field should seriously consider this book as his or her starting point.<br />That said, I don't believe that this book alone will prepare anyone without significant experience to pass the Network+ exam (especially the 2001 objectives). It is Windows-centric and core concepts such as the OSI model, IP addressing, and name resolution demand more detail. And yes, as other reviewers have said, there are a few irritating typos. Despite these irritations, the book and bundled CD were very useful during my certification preparation, and they'll probably help you, too.	2001-08-14

Unfortunately, I bought it to learn more about the server-building side of Linux, and found it lacking. Owners of any relatively current version of Mueller's book (say, 8th Ed. or later) have no real need for this edition... with that book, a few HOW-TO print-outs, scissors, and glue, they could make their own!<br />Never the less, this book is still a great guide to hardware. The non-Windows perspective makes it an excellent complement to Minasi's or Bigelow's book, and it is fairly current (with coverage of RDRAM, DVDs, and FireWire). The CD comes in handy, too. Bottom line: if it's time to upgrade your copy of Upgrading &amp; Repairing PCs, you might as well dual-boot.	2001-07-27

A day which shall live in infamy... the day when Microsoft retired the Windows NT MCSE exams, making hundreds of certification prep books obsolete.<br />But not this one.<br />The core exams may be gone, but the products they taught and tested - NT Server, NT Workstation, Windows 95 - are still omnipresent on corporate networks and technician's workbenches. If you are responsible for the care and feeding of older versions of Windows, and most Win2k MCSEs are, then you need to understand everything in this book. Additionally, much of this material has been added to CompTIA's revised A+ exam, so this book remains an excellent certification study guide (just for a different certification!).<br />Forget the title - if you need a quick reference or refresher on Windows NT networking, this is still one of the best on the shelf.<br />[Note: in the second edition of this book, the Windows 95 section has been replaced by an equivalent section on Windows 98. They are otherwise identical].	2001-07-13

O'Reilly, we thank you again.<br />The new Perl CD Bookshelf is an incredible resource for skilled and aspiring programmers. It includes Perl in a Nutshell in physical and electronic form, as well as the Camel book, the Cookbook, and two other titles on the CD. [Note to owners of the first edition: Learning on Win32 Systems is gone now. Further evidence of Tim's commitment to Open Source, I suppose.]<br />Bottom line: if you want to master Perl, and you want to own five five-star books for the price of two, then get this now.	2001-06-19

Terminology, strategic planning, branding, advertising, traffic generation, and, oh yes, technology... every topic budding e-ntrepreneurs need to consider before risking their futures is here presented with clarity and grace. One caveat: those looking for strictly the technical or strictly the business side of e-commerce will find this book lacking. To explain the whole, the author had little choice but to abbreviate some of the parts.<br />Like most titles published by Microsoft Press, this book has a decidedly pro-Redmond feel, with frequent references to bCentral, FrontPage, and other MS products and services (most notably in the section on server platforms... the author would have you believe your only choices are 2000 or NT). However, these product placements do not diminish the flow of the chapters or the value of the advice.<br />Alas, no one book can turn you into a dot-com success story overnight (unless Jeff Bezos' diary is for sale).

Regardless of the title, this is still an excellent self-study course on the TCP/IP protocol suite. Rather than focusing on passing a now non-existent exam, the author masterfully leads you through the intricacies of TCP/IP on a variety of platforms, helping you develop valuable and portable skills.<br />Unlike other books which spend chapter after chapter on networking basics, this book has you deconstructing IP packets on day three and subnetting on day six. The pace is unrelenting to the end, but it's worth the effort.	2001-04-04

I purchased this book because I hadn't worked on Apples in a while and most other books on the shelf were as dated as my knowledge. The back cover and a quick skim led me to believe this book provided comprehensive coverage of Mac to iMac migration, troubleshooting, and the new features in OS 8. It didn't. Part one contains some nice photos, and part three some good advice, but as a technical reference it is sorely lacking (and part two has little to offer anyone computer savvy enough to read this review).<br />Though I enjoyed the William Gibson and Star Trek references, and I highly recommend this book to beginners, all in all iMnot iMpressed.	2001-04-04

With most new systems shipped with Win2K or ME, some people question whether knowledge of MS-DOS is still a viable, marketable skill. It could very well be, if you're one of these people:<br />A hot-shot network admin whose first job duties are to compose login scripts and set up a NetWare server;<br />A power gamer trying to get old favorites to run on a new box;<br />A beginning programmer wondering why their code works on their machine, but won't run correctly or even install on other PCs;<br />A clueless new user who has done something horribly wrong, recoiling in terror because there's nothing but a &quot;C&quot; on the screen AND THE MOUSE DOESN'T WORK!<br />If you're one of these people - that is, if you own a PC - you will eventually have to come to terms with the DOS command line.

The book proves its worth early on by presenting a FULL A.'.A.'. curriculum, then explores deeper mysteries with Liber LXV and a brilliantly commented edition of Blavatsky's Voice of the Silence. Additionally, the book contains several beautiful color plates and a very useful illustration of the Tree of Life (with corrected attributions).

The back cover claims the book will help you &quot;master the essentials&quot; of Wall Street, and this is only a slight boast - it will introduce you to the fundamentals with brevity and clarity, then point you toward more information in print and on the web.

Kidding aside, it would make a fine supplemental text for a high school economics class - the tone is light and conversational, the advice is sound (if elementary), and all essential ideas are clearly explained.

With a wide scope and a clarity of expression, there is likely something that any reader can enjoy and understand within these pages.<br />More significant than any of this, however, is that the book has something that far too many &quot;contemporary Christian&quot; books do not have: fundamental fairness. When dealing with unorthodox or non-religious opinions (take Nietzsche for example), the editors neither preach nor abdicate their religious duties. Instead, they urge the reader to consider the author's viewpoint, relate it to their beliefs and experiences, and take away from it what they may.<br />Any book which shares the good news of God's love and encourages critical thinking is a welcome addition to any bookshelf... whether a Bible shares the shelf is completely irrelevant.	2001-03-08

It is concise, current, inexpensive (how often do these words apply to computer books?), enjoyable to read, and, above all, USEFUL. The authors mingle sound advice and dry humor with a casual writing style, keeping the reader engaged and entertained as s/he absorbs the most (by nature) boring technical details. Technicians who charge by the hour should buy this book immediately... it will pay for itself in a week or two.<br />That said, this book is NOT &quot;the only book you'll ever need&quot;. Though I agree with most of the authors' opinions, honest debate is always a good thing (for example, they write that, as of June 2000, Socket 7 is obsolete. I think now is the time to buy, as several of my clients are budget-conscious and still essentially happy with their 486s). Additionally, this book needs a chapter on modems, and more second-tier reviews would be nice, but I suppose that's what the website is for.<br />Bottom line: get yourself a big thick &quot;phone book&quot; on PC repair (Bigelow and Mueller come to mind) and this book and you'll be equipped for most any upgrade or buying decision that comes your way. But without a strong technical background or a huge reference work nearby, don't open the case.	2001-02-23

The coverage of Linux was lacking (though essentially favorable) considering its impact on modern networking, but the NetWare material seemed designed to subliminally influence the reader to sign up for a Novell to Windows 2000 Migration course.<br />Also, I do not think the book was cross-referenced enough... there was a &quot;see also&quot; here and there, but I feel that books of this kind should contain far more, leading the reader down a winding road of understanding that ultimately returns to its point of origin.<br />If you're an aspiring MCSE or you work in an all-Microsoft shop, then bump up my rating by one star and get a copy immediately. If you're looking for comprehensive coverage of ALL networking concepts, consider looking elsewhere.	2000-10-25

Rather than focusing on specific flavors or specific results, this book teaches Unix at the conceptual level, giving you the skills needed to get at least a little work done on any system (like how to read man pages, how to navigate X windows, and how to use the editor of the gods, vi). Additionally, the material on shell scripting and networking was exceptional.<br />While this book would serve well as a textbook (it is well-indexed and includes review questions), it is also a prime choice for new Linux users of the &quot;I got it installed, now what?&quot; variety. The only things holding back my fifth star are the minor but unfortunately frequent errors (but it is a first printing and, to the author's credit, errata is available online). All in all, a great book, certain to get better with time.	2000-10-25

If you have the slightest interest in Unix system administration, you NEED this book... it will either equip you for the job or make you consider a new line of work.<br />The changes in the IT industry over the last five years are reflected in the third edition of this book, as it now focuses only on Solaris, HP-UX, FreeBSD, and RedHat Linux. While this is a good cross-section of all *nixes, users of SunOS, OSF/1, or IRIX looking for platform-specific examples should probably stick with the second edition (and it comes with a CD).<br />Other significant changes to the book include expanded coverage of networking (for example, TCP/IP and Routing are now two separate chapters) and a new chapter on &quot;hosting the satanic banquet&quot; of a mixed Windows/Unix environment (which I find invaluable). Also, topics of diminishing importance (such as Usenet) no longer have their own chapters, but are still covered in appropriate detail.<br />I can not praise this book highly enough, and Linus Torvalds agrees with me.

Looking for a thought-provoking anthology of existentialist (and quasi-existentialist) authors, which flows effortlessly from one section to the next, and brings a smile (or a furrowed brow) to all who read it? Then I can think of no better book.<br />The selections in this book were chosen for their readability, not their weight, so academic philosophers may find this book lacking. But were it not for books like this, which enchant the layman and force him (or her) to examine primary sources, would there be any philosophy majors?<br />From Camus' notion of a sustaining inward rebellion, to Sartre's brilliant reevaluation of ethics (prose in &quot;Self-deception&quot;, poetry in &quot;The Wall&quot;), to the great battle over Christianity between Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, there is certainly something of vital importance to most people contained in these pages. As an individual's right is sovereign, I will not urge you to like this book, or even to read it - this, like all things, you must decide for yourself.	2000-10-20

Great results can be produced by using the book as designed (download a copy of Personal Oracle, and spend three hours a day hacking the &amp;@:=#! out of it). However, these favorable reviews can be misleading, as they lack a &quot;Who is this book for?&quot; section. Unlike many &quot;Teach Yourself&quot; titles, this is not good reading for the absolute novice. To get the most from this book, you should have:<br />1. Functional and theoretical knowledge of at least one high-level programming language.<br />2. A good understanding of database theory and terminology.<br />3.

US	50103760	R2O0XF3RK4UI65	0671520989	758599176	Make It So: Leadership Lessons from Star Trek: The Next Generation	Books	2	15	16	N	N	Unnecessary	Maybe it's just me, but I found the &quot;leadership lessons&quot; in this book painfully obvious... one does not need to be a born leader to understand, for example, that &quot;if one fails to listen to what another  is saying, one will often fail to properly respond to what has been  said&quot;.<br />Additionally, I found the Star Trek metaphor used rather  clumsily, from the continual references to &quot;the Starfleet&quot; (which  got on my Trek nerd nerves) to the ending of each entry with &quot;Make it  so&quot;. I would have preferred more insight into leadership and less  attempts to sound like Picard.<br />While this book was pleasant to read, I  simply do not find it that useful. One would be advised to look for  leadership lessons in the past (perhaps from Confucius or Sun Tzu), rather  than in a fictitious 24th century.	2000-05-19

Each chapter contains a list of symptoms, suggestions, and solutions in an accessible format, helping a technician solve even the most obscure  hardware problem quickly. Any book that keeps you from looking like a fool  in front of a customer is worth its weight in gold (and it hasn't let me  down yet).<br />This book is also good for aspiring technicians, presenting  exhaustive (but not overwhelming) coverage of topics you are sure to see on  the A+ or CST exams. The author is kind enough to include useful diagrams  and historical tidbits throughout the work, making the arcane  comprehensible and the boring bearable. How many computer books can you  think of that accomplish such a feat?<br />Mr. Bigelow, if you're reading  this, I would like to thank you for producing such a wonderful book.  Suggesting it to others is the least I can do.	2000-05-19

GET THIS BOOK. You will not find a better last minute review anywhere (think MCSE Cliff Notes). Even if you plan to certify on the Windows 2000 track, this book is still incredibly  helpful... you need to know something of NT to make the most of Win2K, and  this book has no frivilous details.<br />Aside from O'Reilly's reputation and  the quality of the content, there is one other thing that makes me regard  this book so highly: price. Most truly awful MCSE books cost twice as much!	2000-05-07

You've got to give Stream International credit for one thing - they produced a decent book on NT that weighs less than fifty pounds. Unfortunately, it's a little light on content as well. If you are a novice  looking for a nicely bound copy of the Windows NT help file, then this is  an excellent choice... savvy users and technicians would be better served  by something more comprehensive.<br />One other thing bears mentioning: my  copy of the book is HOT PINK, not the semi-tasteful purple pictured above.  Another first from the folks at Stream. ;-)	2000-05-07

I bought it because I had to - it was used as a textbook. Most of my classmates were engineers or programmers looking for an easy elective; I recall them studying the book fervently as finals approached. The network  geeks (myself included) left it at home.<br />I do not fault the book for its  lack of technical detail because that was the author's intent. What irks me  is its overly impartial (some might say misleading) discussion of different  technologies. For example, the section on AppleTalk fails to mention that  it is noisy and slow, and the page on OS/2 implies that it can run current  Windows applications (it can't). Another annoyance is that Ethernet is  barely mentioned (and not a peep on collisions!). Is it any wonder that  this book has an appendix called &quot;hiring a network  consultant&quot;?<br />To sum up, if you'd like to learn a thing or two about  networking, this is a fairly good introduction. If you already know more  than two things, you do not need this book.	2000-03-19

The writing is clear, the code is well commented, and the tone is far less patronizing than those  &quot;moron&quot; books. Not required reading, but suggested.	2000-03-09

You'll find that it's much easier to listen to Craig Landes drone on about IRQs and vector tables after a hard day's work than it is to hit the  books. ;-) These tapes are basically an abridged version of the A+ Exam  Cram, which is precisely what you should be studying a few weeks before you  take the exam. I only wish they made MCSE tapes....	2000-02-06

This has got to be the worst of the bunch... it has nothing in common with the excellent A+ Exam Cram, except for a few republished questions. The book  contains several errors (both factual and typographical), as does the  CD-ROM. Some of the practice questions have little or nothing to do with  their supposed subject matter - there's a question about printer corona  wires on the DOS/Windows exam, for example; many others are horribly  worded, ambiguous, or simply irrelevant (CompTIA does not care how many  icons are in the Control Panel - they want to make sure you know what they  do).<br />With quality practice tests available free for download, why pay  good money for four inaccurate ones? Buy the A+ Exam Cram and the Audio  Review (neither by Michael Pastore) and you'll do fine on the exam. Leave  this to rot next to &quot;Build your own 286&quot; in the Amazon warehouse.	2000-02-06
