Colt can be a brilliant stylist. But when he draws us into the family saga, it is apparent that the virtue and the weakness of this ultimately smug book result from the same truth: Colt is not an outsider looking in at Brahmin culture. Who else but someone completely enamoured with every aspect of what he views as his magical, wondrous childhood, would devote 30 tedious pages to sailing trips (around Buzzards Bay) and tennis games that occurred more than 40 years ago? Why would anyone want to read this? And is an alcoholic any less an alcoholic if he wears a bowtie and is smashed on martinis in a house with a pedigree? (This is a question for Susan Cheever, too, whose drunk-a-log in \\"Note Found in a Bottle\\" is replete with abstruse Scotch.) As well as alcoholism, the characters in this book suffer from mental illness, early death and, perhaps worst of all, smugness. It's a certain type of smugness, masquerading under modesty, like those Yale alumni who say, \\"Oh, I went to school in New Haven.\\" This book supposedly presents a nostalgic look at the fading world of the Brahmin, particularly in its summer haunts. But it seems to me that the Brahmin world is an ultimately mean-spirited one of exclusion and elitism. For a clear-eyed view of Brahmin life read \\"Black Sun,\\" Geoffrey Wolff's brilliant biography of Boston's wild child Harry Crosby. Wolff gives us a Crosby trying to escape Brahmin Boston and all the while embracing it. The truth of the matter is that in America class is a dirty concept, and the Brahmins represented Class in all its very non-politically-correct aspects.	2005-03-08

We begin, for no apparent reason, following Daisy on a farm in Wales, where she works as a land girl. Rather quickly, she marries and moves to Ireland where she has to manage a very large house with little guidance. (Where are we but the familiar territory plumbed by Daphne DuMaurier in &quot;Rebecca?&quot;) Questions about her asocial brother-in-law Mickey are never answered. (What's wrong with him? Does he really keep bats?) It's not clear why we sometimes veer from Daisy's point-of-view to enter the mind of her near-catatonic grandmother-in-law. And the atmosphere of the war years just doesn't ring quite true. (Does anyone in the entire novel smoke a cigarette?) The plot is thin and wrapped up in a perfunctory manner in the end. All in all, not Davis-Goff's best work despite a bit of really fine writing.	2002-06-12

While five of his mysteries have been translated, it is not necessary to read them in order. But anyone who begins with \\"One Step Behind\\" will surely want to double back to the previous four volumes. (Although only a real die-hard fan will enjoy \\"The White Lioness.\\")<BR>Mankell is the best mystery writer writing today. Here's why:<BR>1. The mystery itself is riveting, and the book revolves around that plot. We solve the crime with the team at the Ystad police station. There are no weird or eccentrically-contrived characters as in so many mysteries today. The writing is clean and controlled.<BR>2. Every minor character, every cameo, is a perfect little portrait. There are no \\"flat\\" characters. <BR>3. This is not the Sweden of clogs and girls with long blonde braids. This is a society in disintegration where the criminal element threatens to take over. Wallander's comments on the state of Swedish society today are right on target.<BR>4. In sum, we care about Wallander and the characters who revolve around him in the police station and elsewhere. These people are real. They are our neighbors and friends-- people we know in the U.S. or wherever we live.<BR>For a suspenseful mystery, no one is writing this well today. I am a 40-something woman. Today my friend, an 80-something man, said to me: I can never thank you enough for recommending \\"One Step Behind.\\"  I can't put it down!<BR>That says it all.	2002-02-07

Chapters weave Sacks'  life at home and at school with accounts of the Curies and Humphry Davies and the creation of the Periodic table. For my money, this fusion does not always work out as well as it might. I am no chemist, having stopped my own scientific studies with high school biology, and some of the chapters on chemistry were tough going for me. In contrast, the chapters detailing Sacks' own amazing life in England before and just after WWII are beautiful-- and I want to know more. If I have any quibble with this book, it is that it is really two books in one. But altogether it is well worth the sometimes extra concentration that it takes to read it.	2002-01-03

The first chapters are snappy and original, punctuated by amusingly cynical quotes from the dying actress Nora Mars. But for my money, the much-talked-about science isn't properly integrated into the plot. Marie the tabloid reporter goes to meet someone. In the midst of a riveting interview, she flashes back to chatting mainly about quantum mechanics with her weird friend Marco in the science library. And her conversation with Marco contains an anecdote about her estranged brother. A flashback within a flashback. Instead of intriguing the reader, somehow this manages to disrupt the flow of what plot there is. By the end of the novel the quantum mechanics and philosophy of science act like goop in a drain, practically preventing the plot from flowing at all. Nevertheless, I look forward to McPhee's next novel which I hope will prove just as strange and off-beat as this one.	2001-12-11

(My entire state-- Rhode Island-- has bought only one copy!) It is a beautifully written, intelligent and touching look back nearly 30 years to a Lutheran pastor's youth and the small town church he led. How much more profound is this account of a pastor baptizing babies who are about to die than an account of one more celebrity. Lischer's memoir also describes an America that once was. I have no idea if &quot;community&quot; still exists in Illinois as it did in the early '70s, but somehow many scenes in this book, such as the final picnic, made me weep. At the same time, Lischer is frequently laugh-out-loud funny. A truly great book by a phenomenal pastor.	2001-12-01

Set in 1850s Oxford, this novel is infused with a feeling of things coming to an end. Sadly, like a summer turning to fall. Charles Dodson/ Lewis Carroll is achingly pathetic, and wins our sympathy. Little Alice is bewitching. The novel contains researched speculation as to what happened to cause a rift between Dodson and the Liddell family, but it seems that the friendship of Dodson and Alice was doomed already-- she had to grow up. I haven't read &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; since I was a child; I'm reading it now. This beautifully-written novel is like a dream. Weird, frightening and somehow hyper-real.	2001-11-28

The book is broken into five parts narrated by four different interconnected persons. While it is interesting to view events as through a prism, this technique wears thin in page after page of rambling prose. This novel would have been much stronger if it had been edited down. Much too much verbiage! Much too much wandering over the same territory! At one point I wondered why I kept plodding on. The answer is, you get hooked on these characters due to this surplice-ripping series as a whole. Despite several melodramatic moments, nothing much happens in this novel-- it could have been condensed into a fine short story. For a budding Howatch fan, I recommend  &quot;Glittering Images&quot; or  particularly  the incredible potboiler &quot;The High Flyer&quot; over this book any day.	2001-10-01

If it were fiction, something dramatic would have to happen. But as it is, this memoir of an angst-free international affair reads like a cross between an early Susan Cheever novel like &quot;Looking for Work&quot; and a Shirley Hazzard novel set in Italy, like &quot;The Evening of the Holiday.&quot;  The book is drenched in Mediterranean food and sunlight. The narrator, Laura, is a lovely woman, a big blonde American, perhaps just a tad too concerned with her weight. (How many more conversations can we women be subjected to about diets? It's boring and it holds us back!) There's a lot of sex in this book, yet Laura is never explicit, and frankly, I'd like to know more about her lover. I nearly didn't read this book because of the author's weird decision to employ the second person voice. Why did she do this? After a couple of pages I didn't notice it, the way you don't notice subtitles on a foreign film after a moment. Despite this, the writing is crisp, the organization is simple but enviable, and I highly recommend this book to any woman looking for a charming, diverting read.	2001-08-01

Rose Macauley wrote an entire book on &quot;The Pleasure of Ruins.&quot; Think of the ruins of the Acropolis, all that white marble bleaching in the Athenian sun. But then, think of the Acropolis as it was when it was built-- its many statues covered with what we would consider gaudy paint. Which does the modern eye prefer? Somehow, the romance of ruins wins out, and it is the ruin of Heligan that seduces us rather than its restoration. Restoring the lost gardens of Heligan, in Cornwall, has been Tim Smit's enviable job for the past decade. Heligan &quot;fell asleep&quot; after WWI, when much of its gardening workforce was drafted to fight. Smit is at his best when he describes the eerie atmosphere of the overgrown gardens under their canopy of self-seeded trees. Ghosts haunted the gardens, spreading a creepy air, and Smit relates how he had to call in a vicar to exorcise them. Smit's account lags, though, in the many paragraphs devoted to the nitty gritty of dealing with camera crews, staffing the ticket booth and applying for various grants.  Unfortunately, Smit's earnest writing would have greatly benefited from collaboration with a professional  writer. While this book describes a wondrous project, Smit's writing is often tedious. Personalities don't quite emerge as clearly as certain plants do. Still, I'd recommend this book to any serious gardener. The book is nicely illustrated with many color photographs that evoke the romantic atmosphere of the ruins as well as show the beautifully-restored, productive gardens of today.	2001-07-28

A man who betrayed his closest friends and thereby destroyed their careers and changed the course of their lives. Prof. Newton Arvin, when charged with the possession of homoerotic pictures and magazines, &quot;sang like a canary,&quot; as they used to say in ganster movies. This puzzled many of his closest friends, veterans of the McCarthy era who managed NOT to name names during the Communist witchhunts of the '50s. And Arvin had many famous friends. One lover was Truman Capote, who was less than half his age. But the flaw in &quot;The Scarlet Professor&quot; might be that Newton comes across as a rat on every page. He was a whining hypochondriac; he was not attractive physically (at least in photos); he was not magnetic in conversation. So what lure did he have? Barry Werth does not address this. &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; is a wonderful book to read right now as a reminder of how poorly pre-1960 America treated homosexuals, communists and the mentally ill. It is also a good argument against those who would broaden police searches and seizures. It presents a nice snapshot of life in a women's college as it used to be lived.	2001-04-30

As suspense builds and Gabriel ventures off to solve the mystery, I no longer have as intense an interest in Gabriel's problems with his father and his lover-- except in so far as they might aid him in the mystery. Then, Gabriel actually rejects technical help from his bookkeeper, Anna, who could have taken him a long way toward some answers. But worse, far worse, Maupin ends the novel WITHOUT SOLVING THE MYSTERY. Gabriel Noone just sort of walks away from it. This is a supreme crime! Maupin tacks on an Afterword that plays games with the reader: Who is alive and who is dead? Who is real and who is not? But I'll forgive Maupin anything if he'll just wrap things up! Maupin could forge another career as a wonderful mystery writer. Why not take up the mantel of Joseph Hansen whose gay detective Dave Brandstetter solved so many crimes?	2001-04-07

I marvel at this male author's knowledge not only of  those arcane undergarments but of Gloria's state of mind as she deliberates: Does this dress require a slip? But I am too young to have known the '50s, and what awes me is Maillard's penetrating portrait of a certain type of  young woman. Gloria is privileged, beautiful and smart. She's a sensible young woman who knows what she wants of life. But she is often depressed, frightened and confused. Some scenes are so vivid-- particularly those of Gloria in solitude kicking around the big house during the heat wave-- that I wondered if Maillard spied on me during the summer that I, too, was back at home after college killing time before graduate school. The awkwardness of youth seemed to drag on, and despite the explosive changes of the '60s and '70s, many of those repressive, sexist '50s attitudes still prevail. Gloria is a character who women 20 years her junior can identify with. If this novel has a flaw, it is its length-- 635 pages. But it is well worth a read. And it's highly entertaining, too!	2000-12-01

This brilliantly written and researched book is as riveting as any thriller. You will gain a new appreciation for the countless anonymous generations that went before us and left their mark-- those beautiful, enduring stone walls. An absolutely fascinating book!	2000-11-07

It's a profound novel about a woman's quest for faith and Christianity-- yet it's also a strongly-plotted novel with ghosts, sex clubs, stalkers, Nazis-- you name it, this novel has it! A friend of mine bought 10 copies of Howatch's &quot;Glittering Images&quot; and gave them as gifts. I may do the same with &quot;The High Flyer.&quot; It is a fabulous book! It's entertaining yet profound. Absolutely a marvel!	2000-09-27

Dilys Powell's marriage to a young classical archaeologist brought her in contact with Sir Arthur himself and with the  numerous archaeologists in his milieu. The chapter on Sir Arthur's  Victorian upbringing is perhaps the most interesting of the book. But the  death of Powell's husband and World War II plucked Powell from this magical  world. After the war, however, she recreated some of the legendary exploits  of the classicists who worked for the Greek resistance. A wonderful book  for anyone interested in Greek archaeology or who has ever visited Greece.	2000-04-11

Instead of wallowing in life's troubles, I think of a madcap cast  of characters removing their tuxedoes, their high heels, and hopping into  bed. I highly  and happily recommend this cheerful novel!	2000-04-03

Holroyd's early life in England before, during and after WWII was filled with a cast of  eccentrics-- one grandmother occasionally sported a monocle, the other  shouted the odd word in French; his mother was compared in every way to  champagne; his father was &quot;a most unlikely old Etonian;&quot; and the  waning family fortune came several generations back from Rajmai Tea, a  company whose dramatic ups and downs proved &quot;better than a seat at the  opera.&quot; Holroyd cleverly explains how  this oddball cast of characters  ultimately led him into the profession of writing biography. This is a  wonderful story, told not without pathos and humor. One hopes for a sequel.	2000-03-31
