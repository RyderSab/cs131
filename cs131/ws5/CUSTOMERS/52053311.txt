This book is not filled with big worded, mumbo-jumbo as he suggests.  He may be good at reading Homer or Shakespeare. But apparently, he understands little of legal analysis, which is precisely the subject of this book.<br />That said, perhaps the book is not for the average reader.  I have a law degree, so I find the legal analysis to be easily readible.  Others may not.<br />But as a critical thinker, one certainly comes away from this book wanting better, less biased analysis.  Some of the chapters are very well written and very well argued.<br />Others, however, are downright sloppy ... not worthy of a first year law student.  One particularly poor chapter is written by none other than Ted Olsen - President Bush's Solicitor General (the person who aregues on behalf of the U.S. Government before the Supreme Court).  This is disturbing, as it demostrates that Bush appointed a Solicitor General who so clearly has an ax to grind against Clinton, that his bias blinds him to the many gaps in logic in his own analysis.<br />In fact, Olsen's chapter is so poorly reasoned, I'd go so far as to suggest it was intentionally misleading. If Olsen wins any cases before the Rehnquist court, the &quot;legal realist&quot; will have much case law to support their beliefs.<br />The same critique particularly can be lobbed against the poorly written  chapters by John Yoo and Daniel Troy, those others are also lacking.<br />But the initial chapeters in the book are both well written and well reasoned, which in some ways only makes the contrast with the mentioned chapters more stark.<br />One only hopes that after the Bush Presidency, the Cato Institute similarly puts out a book on &quot;The Rule of Law in the Wake of Bush.&quot;  For if the arguments are applied consistently and without bias, readers would come to learn that Bush is far more like Clinton than Al gore ever likely would have been!  If Bush is held to the same standard to which the Cato Institute holds Clinton, then intellectual honesty would demand that they conclude that President Bush is doing far more damage to respect for the rule of law than his predecessor.ld to the same standard to which the Cato Institute holds Clinton, then intellectual honesty would demand that they conclude that President Bush is doing far more damage to respect for the rule of law than his predecessor.	2002-04-01

Pigliucci's book gives a superb philisophical and practical discussion of the downsides to believing in theistic faiths.  He also shows quite clearly why Darwinian Evolution is not \\"just a theory\\" - but one grounded in every fact we known about our physical world.<br />Mathematics, for instance, is also \\"just a theory.\\"  The only reason we KNOW that 1+1=2 is because we use our brain: the certainty of the conclusion is based on rational thought alone.  The same is true for biology and Darwinian evolution.<br />Pigliucci shows the absurdity of adherence to religious \\"faith\\" in the face of solid scientific evidence.  If you don't believe in the utter complete lack of \\"Intelligent Design\\" in evolution, then you may as well not believe in medicine, physics, bio-chemistry, genetics and every other science.  For that matter, you may as well believe in ghosts, the tooth-fairy, leprechauns, ESP, alien abductions, and Santa Claus - they are all equally absurd!<br />Here's a suggestion: for those religious apologists who want to blindly deny Darinian evolution and all of it's firm ties to every physical science we know, next time you're sick, forget going to your doctor - just stay home and pray.  The only reason to see a doctor is because you believe he or she has some knowledge about biology. Otherwise, your priest will do.<br />If you're afraid to be intellectually challenged .... if you prefer to be blinded by faith, and not ever critically or skeptically examine life around you, then don't read this book.

This novel, her second, is deeply psychological, mostly taking  place in the mind of the main character.  Unlike her first novel, Damage,  it should not ever be made into a film.  The book is short.  I enjoyed it  immensely.	2000-06-20

But this book is entirely too dense for the lay reader.  Worst yet, Krauss seems to have lost his magical touch for keeping the reader's interest.  Unless  you're a professional (or student) of quantum physics, this book will bore  you.	2000-06-19

Peter McWilliams is a superb writer, and this book is clearly his best written, best researched and best argued book.  I have a law degree, but this book is written for the lay person.  This should be required reading  by all Americans, for it teaches is the true depths of freedom, as well as  the absurd lengths our government goes through to deny us our freedoms.	2000-06-19

Dennet argues his point with superb logic.  This is an excellent book.  But it's not for the weak minded who cling to their silly &quot;creationism&quot; fantasies like some who have reviewed it here.  That's why Darwin's idea is so dangerous to their way of (non) thinking,  and why they see it so necessary to trash Dennet's extraodinary book.  There's hardly an educated person alive today who would disagree with  Dennet's fundamental premise: that evolution teaches that life can, and in  fact did, begin without a divine creator to guide it. Careful - this book  requires you to THINK!  Imagine that!	2000-06-19

Had I not already eaten from the rotten fruit of &quot;knowledge&quot; of this book, I'd demand my money back.  But alas, having read it, I'd feel to guilty.  This book is a complete disappointment.  One would expect a book  on intuition written by an M.D./Ph.D to have some grounding in SCIENCE.  Instead, it relies on wholly unprovable and unsubstantiated conjecture,  peppered with anectdotes that do little to instruct a reader how to  increase or improves one's intuitive abilities.

With the brilliant clarity of science writing one expects in books by E.O. Wilson, the creative and rigorous science of Richard Dawkins, the rationality of Daniel Dennet (without the tedious philisophical  meanderings) and the occaisional wit of Peter McWilliams, Matt Ridley's  Genone is one of the most fascinating non-fiction books I've read to  date.<br />Ridley does what few science writers can do ... makes his subject  comprehensible to even the most novice reader of science, yet maintains the  compelling drama that one lately has only come to expect from books  unfolding the latest theories on quantum physics.<br />Ridley takes the reader  on a thrill ride through the depths of our evolutionary history, sex,  politics, threats of genetic discrimination, eugenics, and potential cures  for diseases that have plagued us for eons.  All the while he rids us of  the common misconceptions of genetics, with surgical precision.<br />If you  have any interest in learning - not just reading ... but LEARNING how and  why we are what we are, and why we can transcend our genetic programming,  then BUY THIS BOOK!	2000-04-08

Dr. Perts book is worth reading by any one interested in understanding the interrelationship between our body, mind, emotions and health.  Much better than the many dogmatic eastern books so lacking in  western-scientific  thought, Dr. Pert makes the science easily understandable by laypersons.  Those who criticize her &quot;whining&quot; against her former mentors  obviously didn't finish the book, or they would have seen her own admission  for her need to release the unhealthy emotions she harbored for being  slighted by her male colleagues who took the credit for her valuable  discovery.  It's seems her detractors are the ones who are whining too  much!  Thought her writing is perhaps shaky at first (she lacks the  eloquence of say, E.O. Wilson), she finds her stride midway through,  presenting an intriguing account of the science behind the vital two-way  communication continuously going on within us.  While her descent into  religion and spirituality was disappointing (she should have stuck with  emotions - which are enough to convey her point), the book still reflects a  solid effort.	1999-08-17
