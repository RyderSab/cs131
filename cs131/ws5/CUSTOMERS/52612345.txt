I have turned many a friend to JQ...and right now I feel egg on my face <br /> <br />YES...  I am afraid this is not her best work. <br /> <br /> I will not recap the story--there is an excellent recap above, but I would like to comment as to why I--and two of my friends--found this book lacking. (AND btw I loved When He Was Wicked....so I do not see this as a trend...) Granted, this is better than most of the fare out there..but to me..that is not good enough.  JQ has been nothing short of brilliant thusfar  in her career....and we can all forgive bits and pieces..but not such huge gaps. <br /> <br />*****AND I should add--I do recall reading on her website that with this particular book she had started it..scrapped it after maybe 100 pages/several months (thus she had not read anything as she was busy catching up...) and ultimately she  started over.   <br /> <br />She had never done this before.   <br /> <br />I am disappointed that her publisher and editor  did not extend her deadline and allow her to create a complete full bodied book--with plausable motivations and memorable characters.  We don't know if she asked for this extention..but ANY good editor or publisher whose job is to guide a shining star such as JQ... SHOULD have the wisdom to send their writer back to fix up a book that could have been fixable...because frankly this book could ruin the reputations of writer, editor AND pubisher... <br /> <br />So..in my opinion, this is more of an imperfect draft that  I am sure...if Julia had been given an extention...she would have realized some of the grave flaws I captured below-and exchanged them with some of the full bodies characters and pomp and spark that we so love in JQ books!**** <br /> <br />No more interuptions...here are my reasons: <br /> <br /> <br />1) No real chemistry. Sure,at the Smyth-Smith concert there are a few flickers..but no real sparks. And as the book progresses--NO flames.  <br /> <br />I just didn't CARE if these two ever ever got together. Period.  <br /> <br />(BTW I think Gregory should be paired up with a Smyth-Smith--it is about time! And the possibilities here are delightful!)  <br /> <br />AND what is this?? After a frank discussion with Violet, Hy wonders about some of the guys she may have turned away? No way! The ONLY guy for her is the hero..yet we wonder if even SHE isn't sure about him--that she has to hold onto this guy as she has already let too many fish get away.   <br /> <br /> <br />2) Hyacynth is not especially likable--and part of it is JQ TELLS us she is this or that but she does little to SHOW us Hy's attributes.  We are constantly reminded that she is smarter than most men and that she is very clever. Yet, when it comes down to it... she seems to have no real personality of her own. Show us how she is clever  and diabolical...please.  Hy  seems more like a character out of Mean Girls than a heroine that we could AND should relate to.  IE at the Smythe-Smith concert..it is more of a joke..vs Penelope who had gone because she FELT for these poor talentless women.  Hy seems almost smug in her knowledge that she is a Bridgerton and everyone will be beholden to her because of this..vs someone who is more of an individual....and people want to be with her because of HER.  Thus, there is not a lot about her to like. <br /> <br />I have found that there was more character developement in JQ's short stories than what was displayed in this book.  Readers need to FEEL something for the heroine and sadly, we felt zero. <br /> <br />3) I admire Julia Quinn for trying something new--and in this case, a mystery, but I never found myself waiting for the big reveal.  No suspense. No surprise.  Again, each character knows a secret that they are keeping from the other..but there is NO feeling!   VERY unsatisfactory.In fact, had this been resolved in a satisfactory fashion, I may have a TOTALLY different rating.  But the way this book ends really reveals how little the mystery really meant to the story. YET this WAS  a romantic mystery...yet there was no romance nor any mystery. Bleh.  I just hope this is Julia's last mystery.  Or, she needs to read some Agatha Christie before she attempts another. And the last page of the book reveals how little this mystery really had to do with this story.   <br /> <br />4) The first sex scene is really..shall I use the word...unnecessary?? Ok the motivations of Gareth to 'bed' her is REALLY weak..and thus it just seems that JQ put that scene in there because 2/3rds of the book went by and there had not been any sort of sex scene.  Gratitious.  :( <br /> <br />5) The Bridgerton clan is more of a guest appearance...and tired at best.  Gregory does not seem more than remotely interesting--and he is the last book.  He just seems REALLY dull. :( And Anthony! UGH! Just ruined the Viscount that Loved Me for me...  <br /> <br />What I really wonder is why Anthony is written the way he is..when he married a far more difficult woman than Hy..a woman who was not afraid to speak her mind when she had too many years on the shelf and was outspoken as all get out--without any sort of fortune or grand family name behind her.  There is no way that after living with Kate all of these years that Anthony would have handled Hy the way he did....  <br /> <br /> <br />6) Gareth's parentage.  I think that having something  similar (two brothers/like brothers)  two books in a row was not the freshest idea...and this goes back to my rushed idea.  I don't have the eww factor that others have..but more that this seems that the writer is out of any sort of fresh ideas.  <br /> <br />7) While I am at it, I am pushing for JQ to do a book on Violet's story.  Yea, we know it ends sadly,  but like Star wars Episode three, we know the outcome, we just want to know how she gothere!	2005-07-07

He is in love with his (like a brother) cousin's wife--and noone has a clue.     Dubbed the Merry Rake, Michael goes through the motions of living a carefree existance of women wine and song when in fact his heart is in turmoil over the one thing in the world he cannot have: Francesca Bridgerton.     Francesca is the rebel Bridgerton. Although she loves her family she wants to be known for herself, not for being a cutout copy of her siblings. She is happily married when tragedy strikes--she finds herself in her early twenties and widowed--and her closest confidant in the world, Michael, distancing himself emotionally and then physically by going half way around the world.     The real story takes place a few years later when Francesca realizes what she is missing from life and Michael returns to face life.     This is JQ's most emotionally powerful book. We get deep into the mind of Michael Stirling and there we find the hero that all women long for--a man that loves so deeply, so strongly that he cannot think straight to realize he could have what he wants.     Francesca is not as complex as Michael--which helps keep this book from getting too melodramatic. She is smart and accomplished and she definately has her own mind!    Don't be scared by some bad reviews--let this book tell this most Romantic story.  The reason the novel is so highly contested is that this is not your typical frivilous and fun JQ novel. This is her darkest most intense fare. Read this book with no expectations and find yourself taken to a place that few romances go.	2004-07-02

I know Jenny will go nuts at this three star review..but that is how I feel about it.  There are parts of this book that I like, and parts that annoy the hell out of me! <BR>Yes Yes Yes, there are too many characters.  And there are too many song titles coming from the jukebox.  And too many nicknames for our heroine alone!   And because of the &quot;too much&quot; of this sort of stuff, there is not a lot of opportunity to really love our main characters.  In fact, there is virtually no chemistry anywhere in this book.  I can see how this book took a lot out of Jenny.  It is work just reading it!<br />What I DO love is the main theme--Tilda and the phrase &quot;faking it&quot; and faking it as a motif.  And the couch.  I could do without the jukebox.  This device was just plain distracting.  I love the whole art theme too.  This is what kept me reading until the end.  <br />Never read Jenny before? Read her earlier works first.

When you are from Minnesota, you learn to skate hours after you make that first baby step.  And the problem I have with this book is that this is not written by someone who loves..or knows Hockey.  The writing is  good...and very fast paced--but the characters are not very believable.  It is hard to like our heroine--...--and that the players would even like her.  There is not much to like except for her relationship with her young brother.  She is brash and obnoxious and unfortunately some of the most intimate moments with the hero are told not shown...and thus there is a lack of chemistry. My guess is that the editor wanted her to write something like Rachel Gibson (why I read this in the first place) and I think she would have been better off writing about the Soap Opera world..where she came from.  (and which she refers to lovingly..) I think that would be more interesting.  BTW, I will not be reading the next book about the roommate.  This woman is even scarier.	2003-07-01
