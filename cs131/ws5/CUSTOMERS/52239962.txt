US	52239962	RLE01SH9JXPJY	1565933958	296724497	A Handbook on Stuttering	Books	3	9	11	N	Y	Many good parts, but out of date	Oliver Bloodstein's A Handbook on Stuttering for Professional Workers was<br />first published 1959. He wrote brief summaries of all of the research<br />findings in the field of stuttering. This totaled 88 pages. In 1969 he<br />expanded the booklet and shortened the title to A Handbook on Stuttering.<br />New editions were published in 1975, 1981, 1987, and 1995.<br /><br />For the 2007 edition, Bloodstein asked Nan Bernstein Ratner to bring the<br />book up to date. The result is over 500 pages covering 2800 studies!<br />However, the book needed an overhaul, not just an update.<br /><br />The book's structure reflects stuttering research circa fifty years ago.<br />Then, research was 80% about adults and 20% about children; and 90% about<br />etiology and 10% about treatment. The first eleven chapters present research<br />on adult stutterers, searching for stuttering's etiology in adult<br />stutterers' physiology, personalities, and other areas. The twelfth chapter<br />is about early childhood stuttering, and the last chapter is about<br />treatment.<br /><br />But, beginning in the 1980s, stuttering research moved to focus on children,<br />as about 80% of stutterers are children, and almost all stutterers started<br />stuttering as children. Chapter 12 starts by saying, \\"To try to glimpse<br />something of its etiology in the mass of information we have accumulated on<br />adults and school-aged children is a little like viewing it through a dense<br />screen.\\" Yes, and this is why the book should have started with early<br />childhood stuttering. One's beliefs about how stuttering starts colors how<br />one interprets data about every other area of stuttering. Too much of the<br />book is devoted to obsolete ideas about stuttering etiology that make no<br />sense in the light of what we now know about early childhood stuttering (for<br />example, most of chapter 2).<br /><br />I liked the chapter about early childhood stuttering. The chapter begins<br />with Wendell Johnson's diagnosogenic theory. The author(s) then presents<br />three studies conducted by Johnson and his associates to test different<br />aspects of the diagnosogenic theory--and the results of all three studies<br />didn't support the diagnosogenic theory! The author(s) take a clear stand<br />here: \\"the central premise of the diagnosogenic theory would not appear to<br />have been borne out by the group data.\\" (page 308) Then Johnson's \\"Iowa<br />Study\\" is compared to Yairi and Ambrose's \\"Illinois Study,\\" published in<br />2005. This is where the book shines: a clear-eyed look at the old studies,<br />side by side with recent research. However, the chapter has some flaws, for<br />example, in the middle of the section about Johnson's work is a four-page<br />digression about whether listeners can accurately count the number of<br />stuttering disfluencies in adult stutterers' speech.<br /><br />I especially liked the the six-page section about recent brain scan studies.<br />This is the best overview I've seen on the subject, leaving the reader with<br />clear ideas of what's abnormal in the brains of adult stutterers during<br />speech. However, the chapter begins with 23 pages about lateral dominance.<br />Compared to the brain scan studies, the lateral dominance studies were<br />crude--e.g., forcing left-handed children to become right-handed, or the<br />\\"Wada Test,\\" which injected sodium amytal into left and right carotid<br />arteries, at substantial risk of death. And the results of most of these<br />lateral dominance studies were \\"inconclusive.\\" I'm not sure what I learned<br />from those 23 pages, other than that neuroscience research wasn't much until<br />the 1990s.<br /><br />The section about \\"Language Ability\\" is good. It begins with studies about<br />preschool children, and then later paragraphs cover older children and<br />adults. But the section lacks subheads so I kept having to go back and look<br />whether I was reading a paragraph about what age group.<br /><br />The chapter about treatment covers the history of stuttering therapies well.<br />Then in the section about \\"Current Behavioral Therapies\\" we get Suzybelle,<br />the scary puppet that punished small children when they stuttered (1972); a<br />hospital in Australia where stutterers lived for three weeks trading tokens<br />when they stuttered or spoke fluently, and they needed the tokens for food<br />and cigarettes (1972); and some \\"innovative\\" programs using a new technology<br />called \\"delayed auditory feedback\\" (1974, 1980)!<br /><br />The description of Hollins is clear, especially on the question of whether<br />the program is effective: \\"Very little published data have emerged from the<br />Hollins program over the years\\" (page 360). I was also impressed that the<br />section on Van Riper stuttering modification therapy included the few<br />effectiveness studies, such as a 2005 study of the Successful Stuttering<br />Management Program (SSMP, a.k.a. the Breitenfeldt program), which found that<br />\\"the program did not produce statistically significant changes in fluency.\\"<br />I like that the author(s) aren't afraid to step on the toes of some of the<br />biggest names in our field.<br /><br />The section about \\"Pharmaceutical Treatments\\" starts out well, covering the<br />published studies of various drugs that either did or didn't reduce<br />stuttering. But the section doesn't mention that some medications prescribed<br />to children cause stuttering, especially Ritalin and SSRIs (e.g., Prozac).<br />No studies have been published about this, raising a question: if an<br />important topic has only anecdotal reports, should it be included?<br /><br />I didn't read some chapters, such as the chapter about personality tests. I<br />read everything in the fifth edition carefully and that chapter could be<br />summarized with \\"Stutterers have, on average, completely normal<br />personalities, except for speech-related fears and anxieties.\\"<br /><br />Smaller quibbles: The first chapter goes on for six pages trying to develop<br />a definition of stuttering, and leaves out silent blocks.<br /><br />The section about measuring stuttering (page 8) doesn't discuss<br />time-interval measures of stuttering, used by Roger Ingham and others in<br />some studies.<br /><br />The section on genetics missed Comings' 1996 study linking stuttering to the<br />genes that control dopamine levels (Comings, D., et al., \\"Polygenic<br />Inheritance of Tourette Syndrome, Stuttering, Attention Deficit<br />Hyperactivity, Conduct, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder,\\" American Journal<br />of Medical Genetics 67:264-288, 1996).<br /><br />I couldn't find anything in the book about illnesses and stuttering onset.<br />Yairi and Ambrose reported that 14% of children started stuttering after an<br />illness or extreme fatigue (Yairi, E., Ambrose, N.G. Early Childhood<br />Stuttering, 2005, ISBN 89079-985-7, page 62-63). Tourette's is linked to<br />childhood streptococcal infection that causes the child's immune system to<br />attack brain cells in the putamen area (ADVANCE For Speech-Language<br />Pathologists, July 6, 1998, page 22).<br /><br />Saving the worst for last, I come to the section about \\"Assistive Devices.\\"<br />This is my area of expertise, as owner of Casa Futura Technologies. The<br />first mistake: \\"delayed auditory feedback (DAF)...forces [stutterers] to<br />speak more slowly.\\" That myth was dispelled by Joseph Kalinowski, Andrew<br />Stuart, and colleagues, in a series of studies first published in 1993. But<br />Kalinowski and Stuart's research isn't mentioned, except in a mistaken<br />summary saying that their 1993 study investigated \\"frequency filtering,\\"<br />when it in fact compared DAF, FAF, and white noise. Rather, we get a nice<br />history of Israel Goldiamond using DAF as punishment in an operant<br />conditioning therapy in 1965, and discovering that stutterers liked this<br/>form of punishment; followed by studies of DAF use in therapy from the<br />1970s.<br /><br />The information about the Edinburgh Masker mistakenly suggests that it<br />produced white noise, when in fact it produced a sine wave matching the<br />frequency of the user's phonation.<br /><br />Next we learn, regarding frequency-altered auditory feedback (FAF), \\"Data to<br />support the effectiveness of FAF in treating stuttering while the speaker<br />wears the device is currently scanty.\\" That statement was true in the 1995<br />edition, but many studies have since been published.<br /><br />A question is raised on page 299 as to \\"Whether or not [DAF] can be<br />successfully exploited to create durable therapeutic improvements in fluency<br />in spontaneous speech outside the speech clinic is still under<br />investigation.\\" Actually, that question was answered by Ryan and Van Kirk in<br />1974, Ryan and Ryan in 1995, and Van Borsel in 2003.<br /><br />There's a wealth of information in A Handbook on Stuttering, Sixth Edition.<br />Parts are up-to-date and well-written, and much of the older material is<br />well-written and still worth reading. But there's too much obsolete<br />research, the book is missing too much research from the last decade, and<br />the organization doesn't reflect current research areas. The book belongs on<br />the bookshelf of every researcher and historian in the field, but not on the<br />bookshelf of clinicians or consumers. Bernstein Ratner did excellent work<br />updating the areas of her expertise, but the field has become too big for<br />one person to be an expert in all areas. I hope that the seventh edition<br />will invite more editors with expertise in more areas, and will restructure<br />the book, perhaps along an age progression of the disorder, with an effort<br />to provide information useful to a broader audience. Hopefully we won't have<br />to wait twelve years for the seventh edition.and others in   some studies.    The section on genetics missed Comings' 1996 study linking stuttering to the   genes that control dopamine levels (Comings, D., et al., \\"Polygenic   Inheritance of Tourette Syndrome, Stuttering, Attention Deficit   Hyperactivity, Conduct, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder,\\" American Journal   of Medical Genetics 67:264-288, 1996).

I have to admit that Alice B. Kehoe is my mom. Be that as it may, her new book, \\"The Kensington Runestone,\\" is one of the most thought-provoking books I've read in years. I also liked that the book is short - 80 pages - and readable in one evening.<br /><br />Ask anyone the question, \\"Who discovered America?\\" and you'll be told that Columbus discovered America, in 1492. Then the English settled Jamestown in 1607, followed by the Pilgrims in Massachusetts in 1620. Right? Don't bet on it.<br /><br />In 1898 a Minnesota farmer found a rock carved with Norse runes. Translated, it said that a party of 30 Swedes and Norwegians were on a trading journey. Ten men were murdered near the spot, apparently by hostile natives. Ten more of their party were waiting with their ships fourteen days away, on the sea. The inscription ended with \\"Hail Mary, deliver us from evil\\" and the year: 1362.<br /><br />The stone was dismissed as a hoax for several reasons. First, no other archeological evidence existed showing that Norse had explored west of Greenland. Second, scholars said that the runes had grammatical errors, words not seen on other runes, and letters not seen on other runes or carved differently. Third, the farmer was Norwegian, suggesting that he'd faked the stone to promote Norwegians.<br /><br />Geologists, however, found the weathering in the engraving to be hundreds of years old. And the geologists who interviewed the farmer agreed that he was an honest, intelligent, and respectable man. The farmer never sought money or publicity for his discovery.<br /><br />The Kensington Runestone passed into obscurity, for nearly 100 years. Kehoe, professor emeritus of anthropology at Marquette University and the author of textbooks on North American Indians and four-field anthropology, has brought together recent research that sheds new light on the Kensington Runestone. One of her goals was to show that using all four fields of anthropology - linguistics, archaeology, physical anthropology, and cultural anthropology - can solve problems that examining only a single field can't.<br /><br />Linguists now say that the \\"grammatical errors\\" in the Kensington Runestone are a dialect from a certain area of Sweden. The unknown runes and words have been found in previously unknown Old Swedish inscriptions.<br /><br />In the 1960s, archeologists excavated a Norse village in Newfoundland, dated to around A.D. 1000. Kehoe describes the dedicated work over twenty years leading to this discovery. She also notes that archeologists excavate villages where people lived for generations. A party of 30 or 40 men traveling through a region would likely leave little or no evidence obvious hundreds of years later.<br /><br />Kehoe also describes 14th-century Scandinavian politics. Let's see, the Black Death killed half the population, Norway and Sweden merged, along with a couple of Danish provinces, then Germans took over, a three-year-old boy became king, who later married a ten-year-old girl...OK, I can't keep it all straight. But a lot happened. The Norse lost their lucrative Russian fur trading routes. Kehoe suggests that the Norse may have remembered trading furs with the natives of \\"Vinland\\" (North America), and sent a party to explore reopening this area. She shows on a map that Minnesota is as far west of Norway as the Norse traded in Russia to the east. To men familiar with Russian rivers and forests, traveling in northeastern North America wouldn't have been difficult.<br /><br />She then shows that Kensington, Minnesota, which is a poor area to farm, was an abundant area for hunter-gatherers. The site is a junction between three ecosystems, enabling inhabitants to enjoy a wide variety of food sources year round. More importantly for fur traders, a wide variety of fur-bearing animals are found nearby.<br /><br />Kensington is also fourteen days journey from not one but two \\"seas\\": Duluth, on Lake Superior (easily reached from Newfoundland via the St. Lawrence River), and Hudson's Bay, via Winnipeg and Canadian rivers.<br /><br />Kehoe then considers what was going on in North America in the 14th century. Cahokia (now St. Louis), then one of the largest cities in the world, collapsed, changing the political geography of the Midwest. And lots of other stuff happened, too much to list here.<br /><br />All together, \\"The Kensington Runestone\\" convinced me that a party of Swedes and Norwegians traveled through Minnesota in 1362. The book also showed how narrow-minded \\"experts\\" can be when an anomaly challenges their conventional wisdom. Reading \\"The Kensington Runestone\\" is a thought-provoking way to spend an evening.land via the St. Lawrence River), and Hudson's Bay, via Winnipeg and Canadian rivers. <br /> <br />Kehoe then considers what was going on in North America in the 14th century.

What makes this book stand out is a character who is ignored for the first half of the book, because he's quiet and keeps to himself. In the middle of the book he becomes the most important character. In the penultimate chapter the plot twists around this character in what has to be most unexpected surprise I've ever seen in a novel. The character is a young engineer with Asperger's Syndrome, although the book was written thirty years before Asperger's Syndrome was discovered. Individuals with this form of autism are extremely intelligent but have poor social skills. They're ability to focus on a task can be their greatest strength or their downfall. In \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\" this is what saves the men, but then...well, I won't give away the plot! I listened to the audio download, which was very good except you really need to see what a Skytruck looks like, as the characters talk about different parts of the airplane wreckage.

From this he argues that this gives hunter-gatherer women more sexual freedom, which they enjoy by having sex with the most successful hunters, because these hunters give them more meat.  Huh? The women with the most food have sex with the men who give them the most food?<br />Barber writes (page 14) that women in agricultural societies had little economic power. This isn't true. Power in agricultural societies was held by families that owned the best land. Women in landowning families had more power than peasant men.<br />Chapter One, \\"The Sexual Brain,\\" continues the rambling style, moving from how ringdoves court to cognitive differences between men's and women's brains (e.g., men are better at visual rotation tasks), to the effects of learning to play a stringed instrument on children's brain development, and the correlation between men's testosterone and crime.  The author seems to have written the book from a set of index cards, and the cards were sometimes shuffled randomly.<br />Barber presents a long discussion of developmental hormone abnormalities, e.g., CAH, relating to adult homosexuality. But he never explains fetal testosterone, which is the basis of normal and abnormal development.  Then he wanders off to  INAH3 abnormalities in gay men, which is a minor, debatable issue.<br />Next, Barber discusses PEA (page 37).  In this context, he mistakenly describes \\"companionate\\" marriages as \\"lifelong.\\"  In reality, many companionate marriages end in divorce, and many non-companionate marriages are lifelong.  What this has to do with PEA is unclear.<br />Chapter Two is \\"Physical Attractiveness and Sex Signals.\\" On page 52, Barber writes that women can be breast-feeding and pregnant at the same time.<br />Barber writes (page 51) that in almost all species, males are brightly colored or ornamented, to attract females.  He then writes that \\"among humans, both sexes agree that women are the more physically attractive\\" sex and that this \\"fact\\" shows that \\"men are in a stronger bargaining position relative to most other male mammals and birds.\\" Barber fails to note that in other cultures, such Masai young men in Kenya, or at other times, such as aristocratic men before the French Revolution, men adorned themselves to look beautiful.<br />On page 53, Barber writes that peahens look plain compared to peacocks, therefore \\"peacocks are not drawn to the physical attractiveness of mates.\\"  But peacocks might see peahens differently than Barber sees peahens. Barber's theory is unsupported by fact. He jumps from fact (peahens look plainer than peacocks) to speculative theory (peacocks don't see one peahen as more attractive than any other peahen).<br />Chapter 3 is titled \\"Love's Labors: Dating Competition and Aggression.\\"  Barber begins by oversimplifying (page 70) that \\"testosterone causes aggression.\\"  This chapter extensively describes a 14-year-old boy who killed three girls at his Kentucky high school in 1997.  But the facts contradict Barber's theory that testosterone made the boy kill the girls. Testosterone might drive men to kill other, rival men, but not to kill women. And Barber describes the boy as five feet tall, 110 pounds, \\"far from physically impressive,\\" and psychologically childish.  This description suggests that the boy had low testosterone, not high testosterone!  Also, Barber states that between 1997 and 1999, all school shooting were perpetrated by boys.  That may be true, but in 1979 14-year-old Brenda Spencer opened fire at a San Diego elementary school (made famous by the song \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\"), killing two adults and wounding seven children.<br />On page 77, Barbur notes that testosterone increases friendliness in men -- which contradicts the previous seven pages.<br />On page 78, Barber states that alcohol reduces serotonin.  The opposite is true (David Lovinger, \\"The Role of Serotonin in Alcohol's Effects on the Brain,\\" Current Separations 18:1 (1999), page 24).<br />Barber presents an entire chapter about testosterone (pages 69-88), but no chapter about estrogen or progesterone. I.e., he writes about the male sex drive, but ignores the female sex drive.<br />Chapter 5 is titled \\"The Cheating Hearts of Birds and Humans.\\" Barber writes (page 124) \\"a single act of sexual intercourse can entirely undermine a large chunk of a man's lifetime reproductive effort.\\" Perhaps this is a misprint, and Barber intended to say that a Victorian woman's life could be ruined by one sexual experience.<br />Barber writes (page 127) that \\"prostitutes are almost always women.\\" I've heard that in some cities \\"streetwalkers\\" are almost all transvestite men.<br />On page 147, Barber writes that \\"when the economic and political power of women rises\\" the divorce rate increases. This is a wrong conclusion from two correct facts: women earn more today than 30 years ago, and a higher percentages of marriages end in divorce today, compared to 30 years ago. Barber fails to note that marriages last longer, on average, than at any time in the past. Both the increased length of marriage and the higher divorce rate are due to longer lifespans. Women's earning power has nothing to do with it.<br />On page 147, Barber writes that \\"Women's agendas are much more focused on providing a good environment in which to raise children, whereas men's agendas are more focused on maximizing the number of children produced; they strive to have sex often and with different women.\\" This is the conventional view, but women \\"agendas\\" include changing partners, especially before marriage; and men's \\"agendas\\" include being a good father, especially after marriage. Barber seems to think that married women's behavior is normal for women, and bachelor behavior is normal for men, and conversely that marriage is abnormal for men and being single is abnormal for women.<br />On page 150, Barber refers to a 1983 book purporting that the increasing divorce rate was due to a shortage of marriagable men. That was true in 1983. Barber fails to note that by 1987 the marriageable male/female ratio reversed, and we're now in a \\"women shortage\\" era. Barber instead claims (page 154) that the population sex ratio has remained unchanged over the past 30 years. This is true, but for some reason the millions of unmarried elderly women don't marry the millions of unmarried young men. Barber notes that it would be better to consider population sex ratios by age cohort instead of using the overall population sex ratio. This information can be downloaded free from the Census Bureau, but Barber didn't.<br />On page 153, Barber writes that on the American frontier of the 19th century, a shortage of women made men devoted to their wives and made marriages stable. In reality, many men went to the frontier (or emigrated to the United States) to escape marriages.<br />On page 166, Barber that \\"actors and entertainers\\" \\"again and again\\" show an \\"insecure pattern\\" of unstable marriages, due to childhood abuse. On page 185, Barber writes that \\"typical Hollywood marriages\\" last two or three years. But I've heard of many actors and actresses with long marriages.<br />On page 192, Barber writes that 1949 was during World War II. Well, he got the decade right. :-)<br />Chapter 9 is about teenage pregnancy among poor inner-city African-Americans. Barber concludes (page 229) that teenage pregnancy could be stopped by improving economic conditions, especially for young inner-city African-American men. That may have been believable in 1965, when Lyndon Johnson started the \\"Great Society\\" programs, but today it's clear that teenage pregnancy leads to poverty at least as much as the reverse.<br />Chapter 10 is about fashions, both clothing and body size and shape. This chapter contains too many errors to list. I'll just mention one (page 225), that women dislike bearded men because beards communicate that a man is sexually promiscuous. Conversely, women like clean-shaven men because they're like sexually restricted nuns. Huh?<br />I'll give Barber two stars because he sometimes gets facts right.

I found myself doing the same thing with &quot;Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns.&quot; The book has pictures on almost every page. Text subheads tell you at a glance what each section is about. It's easy to page through it, read the sections that interest you, and skip the rest.<br />The chapter on what toys to buy will save you many times the price of the book. The anatomy chapter makes it easy to understand where to do what to your partner, and what areas could be injured. The chapter about &quot;flying&quot; or mystical experience is interesting. The chapter about the types of people you'll meet at clubs is funny. The themes repeated in every chapter, on every page, are communication, respect, and safety.<br />I can't give the book 5 stars because the photo reproduction is awful. It looks like 1980s positive mechanical transfer (PMT), a cheap process made obsolete by computers. I read probably 10% of the text. I tried several times, but the writing rarely held my attention. But that's not a problem -- National Geographic readers probably read less than 10% of the articles, yet enjoy the magazine.<br />--<br />Thomas David Kehoe, author of &quot;Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships&quot;	2003-09-03

Buss. It's a college textbook but not dry or boring. The writing is clear and easy to understand. Every topic in the field is covered, including men's and women's mating strategies, parenting and kinship, cooperation, conflict, etc.<br />\\"The Evolution of Desire\\" is not as good. It seems out of date, as if the original edition 1994 edition were just updated here and there to produce new 2003 edition. A political agenda or bias is seen \\"between the lines,\\" that isn't in \\"Evolutionary Psychology.\\" And the writing is confused and haphazard.<br />In \\"The Evolution of Desire,\\" Buss presumes that men and women are fundamentally different. This view was popular in early 1990s as \\"backlash\\" against 1970s feminists saying that men and women are the same. However, current thinking (e.g., \\"Sex, Time, and Power,\\" by Leonard Shlain) takes the transpersonal view that each of us has a masculine and a feminine side, and a mature, balanced individual can use one or the other situations change.<br />Buss believes that men want to have sex with many women, and that women want men to give them economic resources. Buss uses the inaccurate Kinsey research on sexual behavior instead of the accurate University of Chicago research. The latter found that the vast majority of Americans are in monogamous, committed relationships, and that these individuals are happier than individuals with more than one sexual partner.<br />Buss's  bias is apparant in the section that attempts -- and fails -- to explain why women engage in casual sex. Buss ignores the research identifying the reason women become promiscuous: stress. E.g., teenage girls in abusive families are more likely to have sex. The evolutionary perspective is obvious: women who used casual sex to survive famine, war, or other life-threatening situations survived and became our ancestral mothers.This research came out mostly after 1994, so Buss didn't include it in the original edition. That may have been OK then, but leaving it out of the 2003 edition is misguided.<br />That women want men to give them economic resources is a central theme of \\"The Evolution of Desire.\\" But Buss ignores the fact that in hunter-gatherer societies (which comprise more than 99% of human evolution) no one owned more than he or she could carry. Buss notes that women prefer men with social status, but then says that this is because high-status men give women more economic resources. Buss fails to mention the \\"gene's eye view\\" reason explaining why women prefer high-status men. In polygynous societies (almost all human societies are, including our own \\"serial monogamous\\" society), high-status men father more children. In many societies, only the sons of leaders can become leaders. E.g., the 2000 presidential election was between the son of a president, the son of a senator, the son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals, and the son of a wealthy banker. A woman who marries a leader and produces the son who becomes the next leader will have a disproportionate number of grandchildren.<br />\\"The Evolution of Desire\\" discusses only the evolution of human behavior, and never mentions that human bodies and brains also evolved. Buss draws no connections between our bodies, brains, and behavior. E.g., his section on how women's sexual behaviors vary over their menstrual cycles never mentions that hormones (including estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone) contribute to these behavioral changes.<br />Buss never mentions that humans have a unique, difficult-to-explain anatomical feature: a huge cerebral cortex. This brain area enables us to think in abstractions, use language, and, perhaps most important for sexual strategies, to lie to each other. Buss sometimes mentions lying as a sexual strategy, and even notes the \\"evolutionary arms race\\" of men and women deceiving each other, and catching each others' deception. But he never connects the dots that sexual lying (and catching sexual lies) may have driven our ancestors to evolve huge brains.<br />Buss notes in passing that love is the number one quality women desire in a partner. But his view that love consists of solely of commitment, kindness, and sincerity is inadequate.<br />Buss erroneously states that similarity attracts. He correctly notes that most studies finding similarity between couples looked at factors that facilitate meeting, e.g., living in the same neighborhood. But he supports his view by quoting studies finding 25-50% correlation in values, personality types, etc., between couples. But 25-50% is poor correlation, in other words, couples are more dissimilar than similar on these measures. If couples were more similar than dissimilar, the correlations would be 50-100%.<br />The chapter about couples staying together as they age opens with a fine quotation from Marjorie Shostak about how love changes from the fiery passion of youth to the warm and dependable love of middle age. But this chapter is about jealousy, emotional manipulation, and \\"keeping competitors at bay.\\" Buss doesn't acknowledge the existence of love, so he can't write about how love changes through the stages of life.<br />My last criticism of \\"The Evolution of Desire\\" is that Buss never discusses differences between monogamous and polygamous societies. This becomes apparent in the section about the \\"feminist viewpoint\\" that men \\"tend to control resources worldwide\\" and \\"oppress women\\" and try to \\"control women's sexuality and reproduction.\\" But most societies aren't patriarchal, as Buss believes, rather are instead kyriarchical: a few men control everybody else (\\"kyri\\" is the Greek word for overlord). Such societies are polygynous, and the median woman is better off than the median man. Such societies are mostly run by the Grand Pooh-bah's senior wives. And these hierarchical societies were created by women selecting to mate with certain men and not others.<br />Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of \\"Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships\\"nd catching each others' deception.

Many, if not most, have published 10, 20, or 30 bestsellers in the past 10, 20, or 30 years. Over and over the writers say that 30 years ago they did this or they had this bit of luck, which started their career. The Internet, self-publishing, print-on-demand, e-books, etc. are mentioned maybe once in passing, or not at all. What's repeatedly discussed is enduring reams of rejection letters from agents and publishers. I don't know any aspiring writers who worry about that. We're too busy finding ways to sell directly to readers to worry about agents and publishers. This book will give you great insights into what it took to \\"make it big\\" in publishing 30 years ago.

Get the abridged version instead.<br />This book has one good point: consumers don't like the way many companies talk -- \\"mission statements,\\" fluffy advertising pitches, \\"your call is valuable to us\\" while they put you on hold for 30 minutes.  In contrast, consumers respect companies that let you talk to a real person with the knowledge and power to solve your problem.<br />The book rightly says that the Internet can help companies to do the latter, instead of the former.  That's everything worth reading in this book.  Feel free to mail me the $... I've saved you. :-)<br />The authors take this one good point and repeat it endlessly.  They don't give examples of how companies have implemented this good idea.  They don't talk about possible pitfalls of taking this good idea too far.  All they do is say how smart they are to have this one idea, and how stupid everyone else is.  I suspect that the authors are consultants.<br />Strangely, this book doesn't talk about the Internet, post 1992.  The authors rave about how great the Internet was in the 1980s.  Newsgroups were populated by Ph.D.s and bright college students, passionate about their fields.  This is true.  When I got on the 'net in 1983, the people were wonderful.  I met two girlfriends online.<br />But the Internet today is different.  Better in many ways, but the chatter of most newsgroups and e-mail lists isn't worth reading.  Spending time on-line with customers in my field is a waste of time.  Many newsgroups started with smart people, but as stupid people (esp. stupid people with lots of time on their hands) joined and the signal/noise deteroriated, the smart people left to do more useful things, dropping the signal/noise ratio to zero.  No mention of this problem in the \\"Cluetrain Manifesto\\".<br />The \\"Cluetrain Manifesto\\" doesn't explain how to design a website to improve feedback from customers.  They don't talk about (to give three examples of bad design) websites that have no way to contact the company; \\"contact us\\" forms where you have to choose from their list of what they want you to say; and websites that make it easy to join, but have no way to quit (e.g., Audible.com, AllExperts.com).

My mother says that I demanded that she read it to me every night. It's about a kitten who doesn't fit in with the other kittens, so he goes around the farm seeing if he'd be a better duck, chicken, etc. But he nearly drowns when the ducks go swimming (the ducks save him), and so on. In the end he comes home and is happy to be a kitten with his family. Looking back now that I'm 41, Pitschi's adventures symbolize much of my life. It's surprising to think that when I was 3 I must have had some idea of the future \\"story of my life.\\"<br />--<br />Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of \\"Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships\\"	2001-02-24

The books are the same, with some new material.  Much of the new book is word-for-word identical to the old book, page after page.  Nowhere does the publisher say this - not on the front cover, on the back cover, or in the introduction. Instead, the publisher seems to have tried to trick readers who bought the first book into buying the second book. An honest publisher would have called the new book \\"2nd edition\\" or \\"Revised edition\\".  I encourage authors to revise and improve their old books, but not to trick readers into thinking they've written an entirely new book.<br />--<br />Review by Thomas David Kehoe, author of \\"Hearts and Minds: How Our Brains Are Hardwired for Relationships\\"	2000-12-22

Steele explains what's going on in the heads of young women. He has a masters degree in counseling psychology, although he doesn't write like those \\"sensitive New Age\\" psychologists.  It's clear that's he's writing from real-world experience. This is a practical book that will improve your relationships with younger women.<br />I'm giving the book only three stars because the book lacks \\"depth.\\" Almost everything in the book is right, but I wanted to know \\"why\\" young women do what they do, not what they do or what I should do.

The best pick-up line is to tell a woman how her clothes communicate aspects of her personality. Women love to talk about what the colors, patterns, and styles of their clothes mean. \\"The Language of Clothes\\" is all you need to do this -- although I also recommend \\"Big Hair: A Journey into the Transformation of Self,\\" by Grant McCracken, to discuss what women's hair means. \\"The Language of Clothes\\" consists of chapters about how clothes express youth or age, a time or era, certain places, social status, etc. The best chapters are about how clothes communicate gender and sexual messages. This book is also one of the best birthday presents to give to a woman. (I shouldn't be sexist -- the book also discusses men's clothes.) The book has *lots* of clothes, and lots of photos.  It's long and carefully researched.  It  makes you think.  Women happily spend hours paging through it.<br />--<br />Review by Thomas David Kehoe...	2000-07-09

Books	1	7	56	N	Y	This author doesn't "get it"	This book says that women like men to do romantic things, e.g., wash their cars.  Reality is that the first thing women say in couples counseling is, \\"He never does anything romantic with me.\\"  The husband then says, \\"That's not true.  Last weekend I washed her  car.\\"  The wife then says, \\"You see -- he doesn't get it!\\"  and bursts into tears.  The author of this book doesn't get it.<br />The  author repeatedly asserts that men and women want the same things. He doesn't \\"get\\" that men and women have different hormones and different hardwiring. He's unaware of the fundamental rule that sex makes men want an intimate, connected relationship; and that an intimate, connected relationship makes women want sex.<br />The author mentions in passing consent issues, and sexually transmitted diseases. Then he says nothing further about these essential issues -- suggesting that he knows nothing.<br />The writing style is weird.  The author (a man) doesn't write  \\"I\\" but instead uses the phrase \\"we here at Goofy Foot Press.\\"  He makes it sound like he has a huge staff that has group sex and then writes books about it. The author's \\"voice\\" comes across as a loser with a big ego.<br />--<br />Review by Thomas David Kehoe, ...	1999-11-12
