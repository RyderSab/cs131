Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life	Books	4	13	16	N	N	Enjoyable Read	I enjoyed the format of this book.  Nicholi sets up a number of big issues (God, ethics: objective or subjective?, sex, love, etc...) and lays out the views of Freud and Lewis, respectively.  Freud is the ultimate materialist, reductionist, etc.. and Lewis is a theist and so it is an interesting contrast.  The author sides with Lewis and this is evident at certain points in the text.  So, it's not completely balanced but I felt like Freud got a fair hearing (and I am an atheist).  <br />I think that there is truth in both positions and that there can be a naturalistic, non theistic, synthesis.  Lewis might actually win this debate, as far as I am concerned, but that doesn't make me a theist since I think that the non theis position can get a better representation than by Freud.<br />Anyways, the stuff on sex, love, the existence of God, and the background information on each of these intersting figures life was a fun read.  It's not especially deep or comprehensive but it's a good starting point for some big issues.<BR>                      <BR>                      Greg Feirman (...)	2004-03-24

It started out very promising.  Longino points out the social nature of science.  Scientists read each other's work, work together in labs, etc..  There is a tremendous amount of interaction and critical dialogue that goes into the creation of data and the establishment of theories and ideas.  She criticizes sociologists of science and philosophers alike for what she calls the rational-social dichotomy: the idea that rationality and sociality are mutually exclusive.  The chapter on the sociologists of science (ch 2) was very interesting to me.<br />But then Longino gets to her positive theory.  She wants to claim that knowledge is &quot;irreducibly&quot; social and that knowledge is pluralistic.  I'm more sympathetic to the latter but the former is ... uhhh... not well taken.  She has a complicated argument about theory underdetermination and how we need a properly structured community to select justified assumptions to properly bridge the gap between data and theory.  But I see no reason to think that a community adds justification to assumptions or bridging principles that are not somehow reducible to what individuals do.  She also claims that observation and reasoning are social processes, at least in the sciences.  But, if we take a good analogy, is production and social cooperation through the division of labor &quot;irreducibly&quot; social?  Are the material goods, like cars and computers, or the processes through which we produce them in factories or offices irreducibly social?  Or are they simply the product of the combined actions of individuals?  The latter seems the default position and Longino doesn't present any arguments for her position besides for underdetermination.<br />I didn't read the stuff on pluralism which, like I said, I'm more sympathetic to.<br />There is some interesting stuff in this book but alot of it is complex, incomprehensible, philosophical arguments.  The arguments she makes are pretty technical alot of times and, most importantly, her theory didn't really add anything to my understanding of science.

The influence of science today, and its prestite, is pervasive.  So this is an interesting topic.  But Shapin's book is only an introduction.  You'll get some names (Boyle, Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, Newton) and some interesting quotes and summaries of their thought.  The issues of experiment, measurement and mathematization are treated.  But none of it is in much depth.  You won't learn any of the specifics of Copernicus, Galileo or Newton.  If this is your first intro to the subject, it's fine.  But for someone like me who already has somewhat of a background, most of this was stuff I already knew.  It's well written, easy to read and has somewhat of a critical perspective, which is nice.

It addresses both justice of war and justice in war.  Most importantly, it is philosophical and deep while at the same time always clear and well illustrated with concrete examples and historical cases.  It really could not be better written.  Every chapter is concise, fascinating and provides an excellent overview/introduction to its respected subject.  <br />The main framework for Justice of War is the legalist paradigm/domestic analogy.  In society, one is allowed to defend oneself if attacked.  Analagously, a country can fight a war in self defense.  Similarly, if evidence is uncovered that someone is plotting a murder or robbery, domestic authorities don't have to wait until he actually commits the crime to intervene.  When the evidence accumulates to a certain level, beyond reasonable doubt say, they can intervene and pre-empt him.  Same thing applies on the international scale: pre-emption is legitimate.  Walzer illustrates this with the Six Day War of 1967, a preemptive war initiated by Israel.  Of course, the current War on Iraq is supposed to be preemptive as well.  But, as Walzer shows, it is in fact preventive.  Prevention is when you intervene against a known bad person or country without specific evidence of an imminent attack because one believes that this person or country would harm one if it could and it can't be allowed to gain more power, because then it will attack, even though it won't now.  Or roughly that ;)  Walzer claims that preventive wars sometimes lead to unnecesary wars, to wars against countries that never would have attacked.  Therefore, they are unjustified; we should wait until we have sufficient evidence for plans of a definite attack at some point in the near future.  I find if persausive.<br />The stuff on justice in war is just as good.  Non-combatants should be immune since they pose no threat.  But, of course, who counts as a non-combatant?  What about workers in a munitions factory?  What about factories pumping out clothes and supplies that the military depends on?  Other rules of conduct in war such as unnecessary suffering, double effect, proportionality and torture are discussed.  So is the issue of who is responsible for war: just the political leaders?  Citizens, too?  Very interesting stuff.<br />I don't completely agree with Walzer, on things like Humanitarian Intervention and some other things, but this is nevertheless a great book.  Read this and &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia&quot; and you'll have a great foundation for a well reasoned political philosophy.<br />                Greg Feirman (gfire77@yahoo.com)	2004-03-21

There are excerpts from all of the major philosophers from that period: Hegel, Schopenhauer, Marx, Kierkegaard, Mill, James and Nietzsche.  Plus, for each philosopher there is a brief biography and summary of each of the excerpts useful for placing the excerpts in context and for understanding them.<br />Personally, I hadn't read much of any of these besides from Marx and Mill.  But I sure enjoyed discovering these guys.  Hegel is barely intelligible as far as I am concerned.  But Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and James are impassioned.  19th Century philosophy is often understood as the Romantic Reaction against the overly sterile, mechanical, hyper rational philosophy of the Enlightenment.  And I agree.  It's worth reading these guys for their critique of rational man, faith in science and progress, and inattention to will, passion, emotion and life as it is really lived by existing, actual human beings.  Up until quite recently, I've been pretty much an unquestioning believer in the value of reason, material progress, etc..

I was assigned it for a graduate seminar in Political Philosophy as a &quot;refutation of Nozick&quot;.  So I was curious to see how he went about refuting Nozick.  I think that his arguments are interesting and it is a good excercise to understand them, and what is wrong with them since I don't think they ultimately work.<br />He criticizes the claim that voluntary transaction are just and preserve justice.  He says that ignorance, unforeseeable consequences and accidents show that voluntary transactions can lead from just to unjust distributions.  But the former criticism is unworkable since ignorance and unforeseeable consequences are inherent to all human action and any political scheme.  Accidents are also inherent to human life and not the subject of justice: justice simply concerns relations between men.  He also claims that market transactions are not truly voluntary because of constraints imposed by the market i.e. wages for labor of your kind are set beyond your control, prices of goods, opportunities for work or entrepenuership, etc..  But voluntary, in this context, simply means the absence of coercion.  It does not mean the absence of all constraints.  The latter is in fact impossible: constraints are set because we live in a world that works in a certain way, whose entities have a certain nature and behave accordingly.<br />He also has many criticisms of the Lockean/Nozickean rule of original acquisition.  He claims that it assumes that things in their natural state are unowned and that the proviso (doesn't worsen the situation of others compared to the objects remaining in its natural state) should take into account alternative uses of the object besides for capitalist appropriation and its remaining in its natural state.<br />Chapter 10 criticizes the idea of self ownership claiming that it is appealing because of its association with autonomy and true freedom but that it in fact is an obstacle to their realization.<br />His conclusion, &quot;Future of a Disillusion&quot;, reflects on the demise of Socialism in Russia and the future of Socialism.  He positively presents Market Socialism as a worthy goal in the short term.<br />The book is clearly written and I enjoyed reading it as an opportunity to see what a well respected critic had to say about Libertarianism.

One of its great virtues is its accessibility to the intelligent layman.  This books is alot easier to read than, say, Ronald Dworkin's &quot;Sovereign Virtue&quot; and easier to read than Rawls's &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;.  In addition, it is much more focused and tighter than those two books (about 200 pages less than each of them).  Nozick stays pretty focused on his main arguments and doesn't stray too far into tangenital side issues, whereas Dworkin and Rawls do much more.<br />The heart of the book are Chapters 3 and 7.  In chapter 3, Nozick lays out his foundations for libertarianism: the idea that individuals are ends in themselves.  He claims that libertarian rights follow from treating people as ends and never only as means.  The core of Libertarian rights is the idea that in order to deal with people you must have their consent.  This treats them as ends because you will only be able to gain their consent if they think that transacting with you or cooperating with you (or whatever) is in their own best interests.  Hence, they'll only do so when doing so serves their own ends; requiring consent treats people as ends and not only as means.<br />In chapter 7, Nozick uses his famous Wilt Chamberlain example to show that egalitarian theories of distributive justice require continual interference with liberty.  That is because voluntary transactions lead to inequalities that violate the preferred pattern of distributive justice.  <br />The second part of chapter 7 is a pretty thorough critique of Rawls.  Rawls ignores the claims of the most talented and well off and he treats people's abilities as common assets.  And more.<br />So, this is a very good book on Libertarianism.  Many have pointed out that Nozick doesn't firmly establish foundations for Libertarian rights.  That is true and he admits as much in the Preface.  At the same time, the idea of treating individuals as ends in themselves, allied with the ideaof self ownership, even if it is just assumed, is still intuitively appealing and seemingly right.<br />I haven't read the first part on the dispute between anarchists and proponents of the minimal state but I've heard it is quite good as well.<br />                   Greg Feirman (gfire77@yahoo.com)	2004-03-21

I thought I was buying an account of the 1800 election but the coverage is much broader.  Repeat: this book is not just about the election but is a political history of the US from the Constitution (1787) through the election of 1800, with a chapter devoted to Jefferson's suceeding first term (1801-1804).  Discussion of the actual campaigning and election of 1800 don't start being discussed until part V, pg 227.  That is because this election was so hot and so important because of the seeds of political conflict and discord that had been sown in the previous 15 or so years, from the signing of the Constitution in 1787, through the administrations of George Washington and John Adams.  <br />This is the story of the emergence of competing political parties, Federalists and Republicans, with competing ideas about how to interpret the Constitution and how to govern the young nation.  Essentially, Federalists like Hamilton and Washington believed in a strong central government, possibly with a standing army and navy, a central bank, national debt to obtain a class of creditors interested in the well being of the US government, etc...  Republicans, like Jefferson and Madision, believed in a weaker central government.  Jefferson said it best in his March 4, 1801 inaugural address, \\"... a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits.... and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.  This is the sum of good government\\" (pg 283).  So, when elected, Jefferson slashed the army and navy, cut back on embassies in less significant countries and tried to pay down the national debt (pgs 287-88).  The election of Jefferson in 1800 marked a turning point, a transition of power from Federalists to Republicans.  Jefferson was then re-elected, followed by two terms for fellow Republican Madison and two for fellow republican James Monroe after that: \\"Among them, Jefferson and his two chief Virginia lieutenants (Madison and Monroe) held the presidency for almost the whole first quarter of the nineteenth century\\" (pg 308).  To me, this was the GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA.  <br />This book has great coverage: the debates of the Constitutional Convention, the war between Britain and France that America was inevitably drawn into through it's trade with the two countries, Citizen Genet, the Jay Treaty with Britain, the Alien and Sedition Acts, etc...  I found this book very worthwhile, informative, and easy reading...	2003-05-19

Many people think that America is a democracy but it is actually a constitutional democracy.  The Constitution of the United States sets limits to the powers of government in Article 1, Section 8 (pgs 23-5).  Outside of these enumerated powers the government has no authority to do anything else.<br /><br />  It really is a beautiful system of government.  All law-making powers are vested in the Senate and House of Representatives.  However, a president can check their power by vetoing any laws they pass, which they can then override by a 2/3 majority in both houses.  The president's function is to \\"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution\\" and to the the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.  The Supreme Court and other courts oversee the laws passed by the legislature and, I suppose, the actions of the president to make sure that they fall within the bounds set by the Constitution.  Congress has the ability to add to the Constitution by passing amendments.  And the Bill of Rights lays out a few rights of the people and states that are absolutely not to be infringed upon, though the enumerated powers already limits the power granted to the federal government.<br />  Roger Pilon's brief Preface is about as much bang for the word as one could ask for.

Quadrant II are those activities that are important but not necesarily urgent.  They argue that most people spend most of their time in Quadrant I (urgent and important) and Quadrant III (urgent, not important) but that it is more effective to spend more time in Quadrant II.  Quadrant II is where we plan, think about the best way to do something, prioritize, reflect, etc... and thus provide the best structure for carrying out our plan.  A previous reviewer put it well when he said that this is \\"quality\\" time.  The second part of the book, which is its heart, explains exactly how to use Quadrant II organizing.  Its about translating your mission, roles and goals into your plans for the upcoming week and then reviewing that week in order to learn from it.<br />     I found section two very helpful from a technical standpoint but the most interesting part of the book is chapter 3, \\"To Live, to Love, to Learn, to Leave a Legacy\\".  It is here that Covey and company give us their conception of human nature and the good life.  To live refers to our physical needs which are for health and wealth; to love refers to our social needs which are to be in healthy relationships; to learn refers to our mental needs to learn, develop our capacities and grow; and to leave a legacy refers to our need to be a part of something bigger than ourselves and to make a contribution.  In my opinion, this is a pretty good outline of the basic categories of human need.  They then list the four human endowments (self awareness, conscience, independent will, creative imagination) which we need to use in order to satisfy our needs.  <br />     But I do have some reservations about this book.  First, there is just not enough material here for the approximately 350 pages they spend.  I only read about 225 pages, skipping around, because I didn't feel like anything new or interesting was being said.  Second, I agree with the review of Peter Hupalo about all the copyrighted drawings....<br />     I am glad I read this book because it is a useful meditation on what it means to put first things first, what those first things are and how to implement this.  But I couldn't read the whole thing and all the copyrights and \\"generation four\\" talk is annoying.  I do recommend this book. <br />              ---- Greg Feirman gfire77@yahoo.com	2002-12-06

This book, \\"GRE Exam Verbal Workbook, Second Edition\\" just gives alot more practice on the Verbal section question types and then devotes a huge chunk of the book, 161 pages, to vocabulary.  <br />     The core of the book is really the four chapters devoted to the four different Verbal section question types.  There is a quick 3-4 page review of Kaplan's method, which is no different than their methods in the general book, and then 5 practice tests.  So, basically this is what they call it: a workbook.  There are alot of problems to practice, practice, practice.  And that is really the most important part in mastering the GRE.<br />     However, there are limits to how far practice can take you on certain Verbal section question types.  I think that practice is the whole deal for Reading Comprehension and Sentence Completions, once you have a basic technique for approaching those question types.  The reason for this is that all of the information that you need to answer these questions is provided for you.  For sentence completions, there are \\"roadsigns\\" that signal what the word in the blank has to be.  And the reading comprehension questions all have to be found in the passage you are given.  Thus, getting good at these just requires that you hammer away.  <br />     However, with antonymns and analogies, practice is helpful but can only take you so far.  Because if you don't know the word in an antonymn or one or both of the words in an analogy, working backwards will only get you so far.  The only way to nail antonymns and analogies is to gear up on vocab and memorize a couple hundred words and learn word groups (groups of words that have similar meanings).  This is why Kaplan devotes so much space, 45% of the book, to vocabulary compared with the 5 or so pages in their general preparation book.<br />     In the end, this book has all the vocabulary and practice you need to be as ready as you'll ever be to take the Verbal section of the GRE.<br />                        Greg Feirman<BR>	2002-11-04

I read through the book and did the problems in a couple of days and this provided an essential framework for approaching each question type.  <BR>   <BR>     The Verbal section has Antonymn, Analogy, Sentence Completion and Reading Comprehension questions and it is really important to know how to approach each of these questions, what steps to follow in coming to the right answer.  While vocabulary is very important for Antonymns and Analogies and simply require memorization, the technique of coming up with your own opposite and looking for a close word in the answer choices (Antonymns)) and making a bridge and looking for that same relationship in the answer choices (Analogies) are necessary to tools for handling these question types well.  I found their method for Reading Comprehension and Sentence Completion similary helpful.<br />     The Math section has Quantitative Comparison and Problem Solving questions.  In the book, they go through a bunch of topics in Algebra and Geometry, such as the formulas for the areas of triangles and circles, circumference of a circle, etc... that I had forgotten but need to know for the test.  So I found this section a useful and concise refresher course for the kinds of thing one needs to know for the Math section of the GRE.<br />     Now, after getting this framework for approaching each question type, the heart of any preparation program is applying these techniques on questions; in other words: practice, practice, practice.  And that is what the CD is for.  The CD has 6 practice sections for both Math and Verbal (Analytical, too, but that is not on the GRE anymore, as of October 1, 2002) and 3 full length practice GREs.  These sections are very helpful but there are a couple of annoying things.  First, as the reviewer from 8/2/02 points out, some of the questions on the practice sections, such as Reading Comprehension passages in 2 or 3or 4 cases, were already used in the book.  Second, some of the questions are unanswerable, at least on the math, because I wasn't able to read the letters, such as x, y, z or a on my computer screen or, in one case, a necessary piece of information was left out (then, the explanation proceeded using that piece of information!).  The answer explanations are essential because you have to learn why you missed a question and they are generally very helpful but some of them have mistakes which is frustrating (I can't back this up right now with specifics but I did make a note of it).<br />     All in all, this book and CD provides alot of bang for the buck and I have found it essential in my prepations.  I just wish they wouldn't use the same Reading Comp passages on the CD as they do in the book and that they would make sure you could read the question on some of the geometry math questions because this is really annoying when you are trying to take a test and make everything as test like as possible and these kinds of things pop up.<br />                         Greg Feirman<BR>                         gfire77@yahoo.com	2002-10-29

It is workmanlike, basic and easy to read.  It is not spectacular but it is very solid.<br /> I did enjoy reading it, however. The first two chapters give alot of background information on von Mises's life and work and I found that interesting because it is always nice to know a bit about an author as a person rather than just his work. And the bottom line about von Mises is that he was a couragous, honest and brilliant man and the proof is in the tremendous admiration earned by worthy friends and supporters.<br /> The Third chapter takes up von Mises's ideas on methodology, his a priorism and his commitment to value free economics. The two page section \\"The Intellectually Revolutionary Character of Economics\\" is really good. Section 5 of the chapter, \\"Mises' Methodological Defense\\" didn't really help me understand Mises's case for a priorism as opposed to empiricism, but I already know that from \\"Human Action\\" (huan events are complex and variables can't be held constant so it is always possible to come up with different plausible explanations for happenings; you can never isolate specific causes and their effects because it is not clear what is causing what). Section 6 \\"Mises and the A Priori: The Extremist?\\" explains what Hayek thought was a critique of Mises and Kirzner shows how it wasn't but I couldn't follow him. The one page section \\"Mises and the A Priori: Not So Extreme!\\" was appreciated because it gives alot more plausibility to Mises's claims about economics having to proceed a priori; I like the idea of economic logic but I think empirical studies and just common sense observation have got to play a role in economics, though I need to think about this more.<br /> Chapter Four was pretty familiar but \\"The Entreprenurial Character of the Misesian Market Process\\" was welcome because it just emphasized for me how central the entreprenuer is to Mises's conception of how the marketworks. <br /> I skipped Chapter Five on monetary theory, the business cycle and interest rates but it looks pretty good.<br /> Chapter Six tries to address how Mises reconciled his idea of value free economics with his passionate arguments for capitalism and against socialism and interventionism. Socialism can't work and interventionism produces consequences the intervenionists didn't want and eventually leads to socialism (which doesn't work ;) I accept the arguments by Ayn Rand on the foundations and standard of ethics and so I can argue rationally for capitalism but I don't know that von Mises can.<br /> In the end, I think that one has to read von Mises himself to get an appreciation of just how deep and comprehensive his grasp of human action and economics is. But this book does provide a little context and a useful overview. Maybe I was expecting too much; after all, how are you going to do justice to one of the greatest thinkers of all time in 200, double spaced pages? Can't be done.<BR> <BR>	2002-10-13

While this is without question the wealthiest country to have ever existed in human history, that does not mean that everybody has an easy time making ends meet. The unskilled jobs like waitressing, house cleaning or working in retail are physically demanding, generally unstimulating intellectually, lacking perhaps in upward mobility and poorly paying. Ehrenreich takes us to the bottom of working American society and shows that it is sometimes ugly and often brutally difficult. As far as her descriptions of her jobs, her co-workers, and all of that, this book is 5 stars.<br /> The problem is that Ehrenreich lacks a solid understanding of economic principles. She concludes that rents are too high and wages are too low and blames the latter on the greediness of employers, saying that the reason wages aren't rising is \\"employers resist wage increases with every trick they can think of and every ounce of strength they can summon\\" (pg 203). Her solution is the typical, thoughtless modern liberal solution: government intervention to raise wages and create more affordable housing. What she fails to realize is prices (such as wages and rents) are determined by the natural laws of reality, in this case usually by the law of supply and demand. Thus, if you raise wages, you cause unemployment because more labor is demanded at lower wages, less at higher. As costs get higher, marginal costs can exceed marginal benefits for employers and they are therefore not interested in hiring more workers. The same applies to housing: if you impose rent controls, this makes it unprofitable for certain landlords to operate their buildings and thus they will take their buildings off the market, decreasing supply and putting some people out on the streets. Raising wages will raise wages for some but cause unemployment for others; rent control will lower rents for some but cause others to be without housing. I think that anyone wanting to seriously and honestly deal with the problems of poverty has to at least recognize these laws of economics.<br /> Because of her modern liberal beliefs, Ehrenreich overlooks factors beyond the greed of capitalists and employers that are partially responsible for poverty. One obvious, and overlooked, cause of poverty is taxes. Low wage workers in California pay almost 30% of their gross income in taxes (15% in federal, 6.2% social security, %1.45 medicare, .9% disability insurance, and I am not sure what CA state taxes are but I believe around 5%). This kind of huge expense makes the difference between being able to meet the rent and not being able to. <br /> Another overlooked area is all the government regulations that increase the costs of doing business and thus increase the prices that business must charge in order to meet costs and make a profit. I am not an expert but I would bet that one of the reasons that housing is so expensive is the mass of government regulations boosting the cost of contstruction and operation of affordable homes and apartments.  For instance, I often see articles in newspapers about home and condo builders being sued for construction defects and juries awarding huge damages to plaintiffs.  This kind of high liability environment increases costs for builders and thus increases prices for homes and apartments.<br /> I don't believe that the free market is a panacea that will create a capitalist utopia but modern liberal solutions are tired and ignorant and they don't help anyone. In fact, alot of Ehrenreich's fellow employees in her low wage jobs didn't appreciate her tirades about low wages and employer exploitation because they were happy to have the jobs they did, or at least would rather have the jobs than not, and her tirades threatened their well being.<br /> In sum, Ehrenreich has written a clear, entertaining and sobering book and I enjoyed reading it very much. But her solutions are tired and ignorant and they don't take intellectual responsibility for dealing with the problem she cares so much about.<br /> Greg Feirman...	2002-09-25

Richard Dawkins's \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" is a fire works show of a book. Sound thinking and deep insight jump out from nearly every page. I want to say a little something about the subject matter and then about Dawkins's style.<BR> <BR> I have very little background in Biology or Natural Science and I consider this book to be a superb introduction to Evolutionary Theory. Dawkins lays out the problem beautifully in Chapter 1, writing \\"Complicated things, everywhere, deserve a very special kind of explanation. We want to know how they came into existence and why they are so complicated\\" (pg 1). He goes on to define the way in which living things are complicated as \\"improbable and... specifiable in advance\\" (pg 8). It takes a little unpacking to get at what that means but he does a marvelous job. He then goes on to talk about the kind of explanation this book is about: \\"how the complicated things came into existence in the first place\\" (pg 13). The end of the chapter describes the structure and function of the eye and chapter 2 is about the structure and function of echolation in bats. These are examples of complicated things, organs in this case, that deserve a special kind of explanation because they are improbable and have a certain function. Chapter 3 introduces us to the idea of Cumulative Selection. Chapter 4 is on the plausibility of a fine grade of functional intermediates in the evolution of complex organs and then about some cases of convergent evolution. Chapter 5 is on genetics. The final chapter, Chapter 11, addresses alternative theories such as Lamarkism, Neutralism, Mutationism and Creationism. <br /> The thing that really stands out for me about this book is the thoroughness and perspective that Dawkins brings to his subject. This is not just a compilation of facts but a series of arguments, with supporting evidence, and alot of consideration of alternative viewpoints.  The book is very broad in its coverage of Biology and also of the Philosophy that is related to this subject matter. I don't think this book could have been written any better. The reasoning is rigorous, the book is comprehensive, it addresses all kinds of criticisms, and it is written in a tone of immense curiosity, wonder, appreciation and passion for understanding that is engaging and exciting. Too good!<br /> ...	2002-08-26
US	51759818	R1MRLGVDUWME11	0553280414	586746552	A Separate Peace	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Complicated, Beautiful and Compelling	I am having a very unusual response to \\"A Separate Peace\\" (1959) by John Knowles.  There are alot of different aspects of the novel to which I am responding in different ways.  Overall, I am glad I read it though I'd like to understand it a bit better.<br /><br />  The best thing about the novel, without doubt, is the character of Phineas.  I realized at the end that Phineas is the moral exemplar for Knowles.  This novel is set against the backdrop of World War II and Knowles has ideas about the causes of wars of this kind.  It is caused by human nature or by certain choices that humans make or certain kinds of character traits.  But if we were all like Phineas, there would be no wars.  Towards the end, Gene, the novel is from his perspective, says to Phineas, \\"Phineas, you wouldn't be any good in the war, even if nothing had happened to your leg..... there'd be a lull in the fighting, and the next thing anyone knew you'd be over with the Germans or the Japs, asking if they'd like to field a baseball team against our side...... You'd get things so scrambled up nobody would know who to fight anymore\\" (pg 182).  In this context, one begins to understand Phineas's love of sports.  This is the kind of competition that a spirit of his kind finds its true expression in.  Phineas has no hatred, no desire to destroy and hurt other people, no envy.  He is simply free and serenely happy founded on \\"an extra vigor, a heightened confidence in himself, a serene capacity for affection which saved him\\" (pgs 194-5).  In sum, Phineas is a beautiful and moral character and the kind of man who could in no way play a part in starting a war.<br /><br />  A crucially interesting question is why Gene pushed Phineas off the tree.  He tells Phineas, \\"It was just some ignorance insde me, some crazy thing inside me, something blind, that's all it was\\" (pg 183).  It is this thing within men that causes wars, as I interpret Knowles.  And he writes, \\"Because it seemed clear that wars were not made by generations and their special stupidities, but that wars were made instead by something ignorant in the human heart\\" (pg 193).  So there is something \\"ignorant\\" and \\"blind\\" in Gene, in man, that causes these kinds of destructive acts; but none of that was in Phineas.<br /><br />  One thing that I truly loved is that by the end Gene has learned from Phineas.  He has out grown that blind ignorance, that hatred within him, and become \\"Phineas-filled\\" (pg 196)(an interesting choice of terms no doubt).  As for Gene, \\"in fact I could feel now the gathering, glowing sense of sureness in the face of it.  I was ready for the war, now that I no longer had any hatred to contribute to it.... Phineas had absorbed it and taken it with him, and I was rid of it forever\\" (pg 195).  And then, \\"Because my war ended before I ever put on a uniform; I was on active duty all my time at school; I killed my enemy there\\" (pg 196).  The enemy was not Phineas, as it felt to Gene at the beginning, but something in him, envy perhaps, jealousy, insecurity, that responded with hatred and a desire for destruction towards Phineas.  But that is all gone by the end of the novel; Gene has grown and I personally love novels of inner, personal growth.<br /><br />  The things I have conflicting responses to in this novel are twofold.  First, it is a tragedy in what happens to Phineas.  Phineas is the highest kind of man and yet he is destroyed.  That is always hard to deal with.  But at the same time, this is illustrative of the nature of war, what war causes, and what this ignorant, blind aspect of human nature can lead to.  What I am saying is that by what happens to Phineas this point is really made forcefully and I really wanted to find out what caused it so as to avoid it at all costs (because I love Finny!).<br /><br />  The second thing is that the interpretation and messages are not entirely straightforward.  Knowles writes sentences to give you his perspective but they are not always easy to interpret.  For instance, the very last sentence of the novel, \\"All of them, all except Phineas, constructed at infinite cost to themselves these Maginot Lines against this enemy they thought they saw across the frontier, this enemy who never attacked that way - if he ever attacked at all; if he was indeed the enemy\\" (pg 196).  So, people construct these defenses, these personas to defend against an enemy.  They think this enemy is out there, \\"across the frontier\\", but he isn't, he \\"never attacked that way\\".  And then \\"if he ever attacked at all; if he was indeed the enemy\\".  What is this thing that we think is the enemy but that doesn't attack that way, or maybe doesn't attack or maybe isn't even the enemy?  Is this that blind, ignorant part of human nature, somehow connected with hatred and jealousy?  I think it is but I am not sure and the text is not defnitive, I don't think.	2002-08-09

Solomon's \\"Introducing Philosophy\\" is a superb introduction to philosophy.  I have the 6th edition published in 1997 but this (the 5th edition) is the only one I could find on Amazon.  This book is so good because it takes a Topical approach but integrates excerpts from the great philosophers.  Historical introductions don't give you the intelletual excitement of great thinkers across time addressing the great problems which is why I like a topical approach (another good topical approach is Tom Morris's \\"Philosophy for Dummies\\").  But the great thing about this book is that it integrates selections from philosophers throughout history, in manageable chunks, so that one gets to read some Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Stuart Mill, Bertrand Russell and more.<br />     The chapters are also very well organized and build on each other.  The introduction introduces us to Socrates and the philosophic tradition and some logic.  Then we deal with Reality, Knowledge, Truth, Necessary Truth (mathematics, logic), Religion, Personal Identity, Mind and Body, Freedom, Ethics, Political Philosophy and Aesthetics.  So everything is covered and there are excerpts from all the relevant thinkers on these topics.  This book is a fantastic way to get a really good feel for the issues of philosophy and some of the great writings in philosophy.  Highly recommended.<BR>              Greg Feirman (...)	2002-07-28

We can answer that question by giving a cause, a reason (which might also be a cause) or something that makes an action intelligible, according to Scruton.  Science gives causes of the first kind while philosophy, in the way the world currently is, \\"attempts to justify the other kinds of 'Why?' - the 'Why?' which looks for a reason, and the 'Why?' which looks for a meaning\\" (pg 25).  This plays into a constant theme of Scruton's, \\"If this book has a message, it is that scientific truth has human illusion as its regular by-product, and that philosophy is our surest weapon in the attempt to rescue truth from this predicament\\" (pg 8).<br />     The next three chapters \\"Truth\\", \\"The Demon\\" and \\"Subject and Object\\" deal with truth, language and skepticism about the external world (and maybe some other subjects as well).  This addresses Descartes's evil demon and the skepticism about the external world that has plagued modern philosophy since Descartes's \\"Meditations on First Philosophy\\" (1630).<br />     After dealing with these metaphysical/epistemological subjects, Scruton turns to questions of human nature and ethics in chapters 5 through 10.  He has some very interesting things to say about what distinguishes humans from animals (language is important) and about the crucial need that religion has addressed for human beings.  I can't resist: \\".... the rational being lives in a condition of metaphysical loneliness\\" (pg 89).  \\"The 'first person plural' of the religious rite overcomes this isolation and creates, for a brief but necessary moment, the sense that we stand together outside nature, sharing the subjective viewpoint which otherwise we know only as 'mine'\\" (pg 90).  The chapter on morality has interesting things to say but I'm not sure it is philosophically sound.  There is a chapter on \\"Sex\\" where he brings to bear the subject/object distinction that he has used since the beginning and which is very interesting.<br />     All in all, this book has, in my opinion, alot of wisdom and truth in it, alot of material in a small amount of space, but it is also difficult to follow at times (i.e. the chapters on \\"Time\\", \\"Morality\\" and \\"Music\\").  In the end, I couldn't put the book down because Scruton gets so much right, is surely brilliant and has clearly studied these subjects long and hard.  And I also sympathize with his general aim (quoted above).<br />            ------ Greg Feirman	2002-07-22

The book is very concise, about 195 pages including the Preface and Introduction, but it is absolutely brimming with insights into what it takes to achieve big goals and, more generally, fulfillment in life as a whole.<br />     The book is structured around 7 conditions that Morris sees as helpful to the achievement of any goal one might set for himself.  These 7 conditions are a Clear Conception, Confidence, Concentrated Effort, Consistency, Commitment, Character and the Capacity to Enjoy the process.  Each part of the book fleshes out exactly what each of these conditions entails.  Here are some of my favorite quotes.  From the section on a Clear Conception, \\"Our choices are always broader than our past.  The best adventures in life need to be chosen, not from a predetermined menu based on what we've done already, but rather out of our deepest sense of who we are and how we can contribute to the world\\" (pg 31).  On Confidence, a quote from La Rochefoucauld, \\"There is a form of eminence that does not depend on fate; it is an air that sets us apart and seems to portend great things; it is the value that we unconsciously attach to ourselves; it is the quality that wins us the deference of others; more than birth, position, or ability, it gives us ascendance\\" (pg 41).  On Character, \\"Aristotle stressed that human beings are always in a state of becoming.  What we are becoming is determined largely by what we are doing day after day\\" (pg 152).  And a few pages later, from Iris Murdoch, \\"But if we consider what the work of attention is like, how continously it goes on, and how imperceptibly it builds up structures of value round about us, we shall not be surprised that at crucial moments of choice most of the business of choosing is already past...... The moral life, on this view, is something that goes on continually....\\" (pg 154).  On the Capacity to Enjoy theprocess, \\"Love is always connected to learning.  All of us can look back on the times in our lives where we have had the most intense enjoyment and see that they were times of great learning - learning a new sport, a new job, learning about a new person, or learning new things about a person already clsoe to us.  Love and learning go together\\"  (pg 166).  <br />     This is a truly profound meditation on how the world works and what it takes to achieve true sucess in any endeavor.  It's the kind of book I will come back to when I have questions about what I need to do to achieve a goal I have set for myself.  ...  Read this book!...	2002-06-10

This book is autobiography or memoir (I really don't know the difference) and is a quick read at 243 pages because Jamie Weisman herself is only 36 or 37 years old. <br />     What is compelling about this book is Weisman's honest look at her congenital immune deficiency, the way she has dealt with and the way it has affected the significant people in her lives (her parents, her husband).  A big part of the way that she has chosen to deal with this disease is by going to medical school and becoming a doctor.  One of the most powerful passages in the book is when she writes, \\"...... I start medical school.  I come to know far more about immune deficiencies than my father does.  I find my own doctors and Emory University and begin making my own decisions about my health care...... I have relieved  my father of the double burden of not only loving me while I am sick but also having to be my doctor\\" (pg 194).  This passage is powerful for me because, to my mind, she has taken responsibility for her life, gained as much knowledge as possible about her condition, and is relying on herself to manage it.<br />     I also really liked the fourth chapter, \\"All Too Human\\", where she talks about the inevitability of errors in medecine.  Doctors are people, too; hospitals are worked in by people.  Too many people just treat doctors like omniscient gods but they are not; they are limited and fallible people, like everyone else.<br />     The third chapter, \\"Beautiful Failure\\", is mainly about a surgeon who removed a hideous lump from her face and gave her back her appearance.  There is a twist and it is really a powerful and beautiful chapter.  <br />     The book lost a little steam for me in Chapters 5 and 6 though it picked up a bit after that.  Weisman is now a mother and the final chapter \\"Begetting\\", is mainly about her struggles to become pregnant and her fears of complications due to her condition.  <br />     All in all, a courageous struggle, an interesting look at the practice of medecine and an honest look inside one person, and her family's, life.  <br />              ...	2002-05-28

That is followed by a section on Internal Factors, dealing with self talk, labels, tapes, fixed beliefs and life scripts.  These are basically the things going on in your mind right now that pretty much determine what results you are going to achieve in your life.

It talks about dealing with fear, being compassionate in your \\"self talk\\", and the power of beliefs and self concept.

It did give me a bare bones understanding of the history of the firm up until the 1990s, especially about the times of Sidney Weinberg, Gus Levy, and John Weinberg and John Whitehead.  But, on the negative side, what this really is is a HISTORY OF GOLDMAN SACHS IN THE 1990S.  155 of 274 pages are devoted entirely to the 1990s and only 88 pages cover 1869-1990 (29 are about the discussion about going public in 1986; and the book starts on page 3).  If there is a theme to the book it is Goldman Sach's existing as a partnership and the increasingly intense consideration of going public from 1986 until it finally did in May 1999.  There are interesting anectdotes about IPOs (such as Ford) and more about huge trading gains and losses made by the firm.  But it didn't read like a book to me but more like a series of articles.  She just kind of recaps the highlights from various times, focusing mainly on the 1990s.<br />     It was not a bad book but I have read many business books that I consider to me much better such as \\"Barbarians at the Gate\\" and \\"Monkey Business\\".  This one is more comparable to solid but less outstanding efforts such as \\"Liar's Poker\\" and \\"Eboys\\", in my opinion.<br />....	2002-02-12

This is a great piece of historical fiction by Gore Vidal, covering Lincoln's presidency, from the time he arrived in Washington on Feb 23, 1861 to his assasination by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865.  This book gives you a knew perspective on history because instead of being an omniscient narration, we see the action from the perspective of Secretary of State, William Seward, Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase.  We are introduced to the abolitionist politicians such as William Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens.  And we see Lincoln emerge from all the doubts that people had about his capability to be president to become one of the towering figues in American history.  In the final chapter, John Hay, one of Lincoln's former secretaries, says of Lincoln, after his death, \\"He was very sure of himself.  From the beginning, he knew that he was the first man in the country, and that he was bound to get his way, if he lived\\" (pg 654).  Hay is clearly a favorite of Vidal's and here is a reflection of Hay's as he stares at \\"The Ancient\\", as he thought of Lincoln, dead on the night of his assasination, \\"But then Hay realized that never again would the Ancient be reminded of a story.  He had become what others would be reminded of\\" (pg 651).  Gore is capable of writing beautifully, like in the two quotes above.  And then there are Lincoln's own speeches such as the Gettysburg Address and the Second Inaugural.  There is also the beautiful and young Kate Chase, daughter of Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, and the object of much desire among the young men of Washington, D.C. at the time.  \\"A grand entertainment\\", as Harold Bloom wrote in his review of the novel for \\"The New York Review of Books\\".<BR>                    Greg Feirman...	2002-02-01

She attributes a beautiful mind to John Forbes Nash but her prose is flowing and smooth.  Nasar is capable of writing beautifully about human experiences such as pain, friendship, isolation, love, etc...  She seems to have a fairly solid background in Economics and Mathematics though one will not learn anything except for the barest bones about Nash's economic and mathematical ideas.  The book is very well structured into five parts which seem to correspond quite well to five different parts of Nash's life and the narrative is concise, about 390 pages.  Another happy feature is that she gives alot of background about the kind of stuff that was going on in the 1950s, when Nash was doing his most important work, such as work at the RAND Institute where they applied mathematical ideas to Cold War strategy.<BR>     While Nasar has read a bit in the psychology of Schizophrenia, I regretted that she didn't really attempt to make any interpretations as to causation of Nash's disease or about the factors responsible for his remission.  She has read Gottesman and seems to agree that Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, which is probably right in my opinion.  But why did it happen when it happened, right after he'd gotten married, had a good position at MIT, was well respected in his field?  Things seemed to be looking up for Nash; why then? <BR>     Another detraction for me is the fact that I am not entirely persuaded of the great explanatory value of Game Theory in economics or social science.  I don't know that much about it but from what I do it doesn't seem to be terribly helpful in understanding important aspects of the way the world works.<BR>     All in all, this is a well written and interesting story, with a smattering of interesting background information on Mathematics and Economics in the 1950s, the psychology of Schizophrenia, and the struggles of Nash, Alicia and other people to deal with mental illness and cope with life.	2002-01-29

This is a 502 page book that is so good that I read it in four days, having to work all day on three of those days.  In fact, I had a hard time putting it down and going to bed last night because I was so anxious to find out what was going to happen.<BR>     The book has many virtues.  One is the fact that the main character, the lead attorney for the Plaintiffs, Jan Schlichtmann is a strong, powerful, compelling and exciting character.  The guy has friggin' presence!  He is a force to be reckoned with.  And he is driven to win, motivated by good, and smart as hell.  Another virtue is that this book helps someone unfamiliar with the legal world to understand how the law works.  We get taken through depositions, through expert witnesses, their examination of the grounds of the supposed contamination site, as well as through motions and all kinds of legal maneuverings.  A third virtue is that it is quite interesting to follow all the expert testimony, the facts revealed in the deposition, and to try and think through the truth, what really happened, for oneself.  A fourth virtue would be that the author goes beyond the case and takes us into the personal lives and personalities of the characters themselves.  We learn about Schlichtmann's background, about his 5 year romance during the case with Teresa Padro, about the extreme financial difficulties of Schlictman, Conway and Crowley as the case progressed.  This adds the human side to the case.<BR>     I can't write enough good things about this book.  I learned about the law, I enjoyed following the facts of the case myself, Schlictmann was a likeable character for me, and I badly wanted to find out how things were going to turn out.  I don't think this book could have been written any better.<BR>   ...	2002-01-17

The opportunity cost is high with a book this size and it just did provide the returns that I would have hoped for.  That said there were plenty of virtues to the book.  The writing style is very easy reading, alot of thought and research clearly went into the book, and the protagonist, Dominick Birdsey is a very likeable character.  Lamb clearly read alot about twins and schizophrenia which is nice.  I just feel like it was 900 plus pages of entertainment, interesting scenes, but that there was a lack of wisdom for a book titled \\"I Know This Much is True\\".  I was pretty un-impressed with the truths Dominick tells us that he come to know on the last page of the book (forgiveness, mongrels and a higher power).  Another criticism is that there is too much sickness in this book.  Thomas cuts off his hand, Joy (Dominick's girlfriend for most of the story) is a sicko who ate this man's skin and fingernail clippings, lets this same man watch Dominick and her make love and ends up getting AIDS and dying.  I like Dominick's search for understanding, for that crucial understanding; his digging into his past, his reading his grandfather's manuscript.  So I give it three stars.<BR>                  Greg Feirman	2002-01-17

In this great book, Stephen Ambrose writes history that reads like fiction.  The book is detailed, structured superbly, has psychological insights into Lewis, Clark and others; in short, everything you'd want from a good novel.  I have read so many history books that are such dry, monotonous chronicles of fact but not here.  Ambrose makes history come alive and I believe that an argument could be made that this is the way history should always be written: with passion, excitement and life, as well as detailed historical information backed by tremendous research.<br />  Adding to the enjoyment of this book is Ambrose's deep knowledge of the American context at the time.  He delves into Jefferson, into Washington politics and has various insights into the America of the time.  We have a portrait of St. Louis at the end of the book, when Lewis was governor of the Louisiana territory.  Also, the quotes from Lewis about the various indian tribes, mountains and rivers is superb.<br />  A superb effort that could only be written by someone with a truly authentic interest and love for his subject.<br />  Greg Feirman (gfire77@yahoo.com)	2001-11-29

This book is about the power of one's own thoughts, the thoughts that we truly hold about what is possible, who we are, at the deepest level of our beings, to make themselves come true.<br />  The book is divided into seven chapters, \\"Thought and Character\\", \\"The Effect of Thought on Circumstances\\", \\"The Effect of Thought on Healthy and the Body\\", \\"Thought and Purpose\\", \\"Thought as a Factor in Achievement\\", \\"Visions and Ideals\\" and \\"Serenity\\".  In chapter 1, Allen writes, \\"(you) contain within yourself that transforming and regenerative agency by which you may make yourself what you will\\" (pg 25).  One shapes one's own character by the controlled application of thought, will and action.  In chapter 2, \\"...the outer conditions of your life will always be found to be harmoniously related to your inner state\\" (pg 32).  People who love themselves, attract love from others; people who believe they can be sucessful end up causing their belief to come true and being sucessful.  Skipping ahead to chapter 7, he writes that serenity is the effect of \\"see(ing) more and more clearly the internal relations of things by the action of cause and effect, we cease to fuss and fume and worry and grieve, and remain poised, steadfast, serene\\" (pg 85).  When we come to realize that everything we want or fear has certain causes and that to a great extent we have control over those causes, we ceased to be frazzled by external circumstances because we sense a tremendous locus of power within our ownselves to shape our lives, to be the cause of those effects we desire and to stop being the cause of those effects that cause us suffering.<br />  A great book that probably requires some unpacking by the reader given that it is so concise.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-31

There is a discussion of how standardized tests and various degrees are used as markers of talent and merit. Gardner puts forth the controversial opinion, which I agree with, that too many people in our country go to college because they feel like it is the only path that is truly respected and valued in our culture (he wrote this in 1984 so I think this applies even more so to today). The idea is that college is only one kind of education, an academic one. But some people are more suited to technical or vocational education or simply to learn by working, rather than manipulating abstract symbols, composing essays, etc... Life and society require all kinds of different skills and math, science, literature, and other intellectual skills are just one dimension.<br />     Third, there is a discussion of the many forms of excellence (related to the many kinds of education discussed previously). In our society, we value scientists and Phds and CEOs but there are excellent plumbers, excellent gardeners, excellent teachers, excellent volunteers, excellent parents, others who are excellent and contribute in big ways but are not given the same prestige in our society. He talks about continueing to learn through one's life; and not just academic, book learning, but learning about oneself, about relationships, about managing one's life, taking care of the ordinary business of life, developing character.<br />     Lastly, there is a discussion of excellence and leadership in the context of the big organizations (government, large corporations, small companies) that most of us find ourselves working in day to day. He talks about expecting alot from people, holding them up to high standards and making them feel like they can make a difference. <br />     Overall, this is a book about HIGH STANDARDS. It is about maintaining high standards in the activities we choose to pursue and thus contacting what is deepest and best in human beings: our desire to grow, develop, and be the best we can possibly be, as individuals and together as a society.

It is purposefully written alot like a novel.  For one thing, the book shifts frequently between different times and places.  For instance, the prologue details the board meeting where CEO Ross Johnson proposes a Leveraged Buy Out (LBO) for the first time.  The start of chapter 7, page 184, then picks up from there chronologically, \\"Johnson rose early the next morning, the memory of Wednesday night's board meeting still fresh in his mind\\" (pg 184).  Also like a novel, the authors give a tremendous amount of background and personal history on the people and companies involved in the deal.  There is history about Ross Johnson's personal history, about his time at Standard Brands and Nabisco before the merger with RJR, and then about RJR the company, dating back to the 1800s.  There is also a chapter that goes into some detail about KKR and Henry Kravis.  All of the information was interesting and well written, though I felt at times like I just wanted to get back to the main plot and away from some of these tangenital details.  It was a choice the authors made between making the book more journalistic and conise or more like a novel, and I guess I ended up liking their choice.<BR>     The heart of the book is the bidding battle for RJR between KKR and the Shearson Lehman Group (which had Johnson on their side); First Boston also makes a bid but I don't think their bid was ever seriously, seriously considered.  The authors describe an LBO as follows, \\"A firm such as Kohlberg Kravis, working with a company's management, buys the company using money raised from BANKS and the PUBLIC SALE OF SECURITIES; the DEBT IS PAID DOWN WITH CASH FROM THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS and, often, by SELLING PIECES OF THE BUSINESS\\" (pg 101).  So that is how KKR and the LBOs work.  The book takes you through the day by day strategy sessions of the different groups, their attempts to raise financing (equity from private investors, junk bonds issued by the investment banks, and commercial bank loans), their responses to moves from the other side, the meetings of the Special Comittee which would decide which bid to accept, etc....  There are alot of late nights, alot of re-crunching the numbers, alot of personality clashes, lawyers, investment bankers, and more.  The writing was so good that it made me feel like I was there, following the deal step by step, and gaining an understanding of what the various parties do and what goes on in an LBO.  It was like reading a story and learning about LBOs and how big deals get made at the same time.  Very rewarding.  I usually don't like books to be this long (515 pgs) but in this case I think almost every pages was worth it.<BR>                          Greg Feirman	2001-09-06

(Life as a Junior I-Banker)	I started reading \\"Monkey Business\\" last night and I just couldn't put it down. I work in consulting so I don't have firsthand knowledge, but as far as I can tell this book presents a pretty good account of what Investment Banking is and what Junior Investment Bankers do.<br />  The book talks about preparing pitch books that are used in selling firms on acquiring other companies, selling a part or all of their company, or issueing stocks or bonds to raise capital for the firm. It talks about valuation, which is at the heart of investment banking (you have to value the other company in an acquisition or the company itself in a stock offering), giving a brief account of the Comparable Transaction and Discounted Cash Flow methods. It talks about the endless revisions that more senior I-Bankers make to every document that a client is going to see.  This part is hilarious when they relate tales of more senior bankers changing the color on charts and then changing it back or wanting to change the phrasing of a sentence, all of which Rolfe and Troob have to do.  It talks about the copy center, where multipe (14 or so) copies of the pitchbooks are made. It talks about drafting the prospectus for an offering with the lawyers and the company's CFO and accountants, and the Printer where the prospectus gets printed on some really fancy paper. Rolfe gives an account of due diligence in the chapter called \\"Travel\\". He travels to so many different countries in such a short period of time that he is too exhausted to stay awake during company's presentations and further, he doesn't know anything about the product so is in no position to judge if the business is sound or not.<br />  All along, however, the emphasis is on the EXTREME HOURS and the ENDLESS WORK. These guys are just working all the time: at night, on the weekends.  They are not sleeping. They are jacking off at work because it's the only time they get a chance.  They frequent strip clubs because that way they know they'll at least get some play whereas trying to start a real relationship carries inherent risk and they just don't have the time to mess around with flirting.<br />  In the end, they decide that investment banking just IS NOT FOR THEM. Other reviews mention how some people really enjoy investment banking and these guys can see that some of the Senior Bankers might be enjoying themselves, but it is just not for them. Rolfe stayed about a year and a half as a full time (plus his summer) and Troob about a year.  For that first year each of them made over $200,000. But still, it was not worth it for them.<br />  I've been working full time in consulting for 14 months now, and while the hours are nothing like what they describe, I certainly understand the TENSION BETWEEN WORK AND LEISURE, MONEY AND TIME, which is the CENTRAL THEME of the book.  How do you balance work and leisure? How do you balance your desire to make good money and enjoy your work with other aspects of your life? If you are one of those people who loves to work, loves working 11-12 hours/day, 6 days/week, then I-Banking, Consulting, whatever is gong to be a good fit. But if you have other interests, if the work wears you down and takes its toll, then maybe these jobs are not for you. Rolfe and Troob have second thoughts about their decision, \\"Sometimes we wonder if we should have continued swinging.... it's tough not to secondguess your decision at times..... Rolfe and I think about what we may have left behind. We wonder, are we missing out on something?\\" (pg 275) Had they stayed the path, they would have become VPs in another 3 years, Senior VPs another 2-3 after that, and maybe even MDs. Their salaries would have incrased from $200,000 per year to $500,000 as VPs, to $700,000-$800-000 as Senior VPs, and into seven figures as MDs, had they made it. Additionally, they would have taken on more responsibility in advisory and capital raising work, interacting with CEOs of companies and having a huge impacton important business in the American Business landscape. It's always a tough choice: the Money, the Power, the Interesting Work, versus more Balance, more Time.<br />  Greg Feirman ....	2001-09-03

The first part is fairly abstract, Millman calls it \\"Understanding the Larger Game\\". The first chapter is about natural laws that Millman sees as being helpful to understand; the next has to do with bringing awareness to our activities as a way to see what we are doing wrong, what we are doing right, and then learning from our mistakes; last chapter of part 1 is about preparation, about slow and steady progress. Personally, having read alot of self help and mind body I didn't really find this first part very helpful. The second part and the first chapter of the third part are, to me, the meat and bones of the book, where the concrete content is. He has chapters on Mental, Emotional, and Physical talent and how to cultivate all three. He talks about the self concept, fear of failure, about breathing, and then about strength, suppleness, stamina, and sensitivity. Then there is a chapter with specific advice for working on skills, like hitting a golf ball or diving or gymnastics. The third part of the book criticizes the focus on results and urges more focus on focus, concentration and personal growth and the last chapter is about new sports, less competitive, that Millman sees developing in the future. Again, this part is more abstract and it is very normative, criticizing competition, though he does recognize that it can bring out the best in people, and then naming some new sports he sees as good developments. He also suggests requiring athletes in asymettrical sports such as golf, tennis, bowling and baseball to \\"use both arms equally\\" (pg 143). I found that a little annoying and I also didn't really see it as having a place in this book. Overall, there are a bunch of good points in here, it is clear that Millman understands how to pursue excellence and growth, but I felt the book was a bit unfocused and there was nothing really new for someone who has done some reading in this area.

He argues that Reagan was in fact a tremendous leader and accomplished much good.  A few of the early chapters deal with Reagan's growing up, his acting career, and then his Governorship of California, followed by his touring the country as a Motivational Speaker for GM.  But it is really all leading up to Reagan's Presidency. <br />Like the previous reviewer says, D'Souza, a conservative/classical liberal, is highly concerned with the development of Reagan's ideas.  He portrays Reagan as highly skeptical of government's ability to solve problems and believing in individuals ability to achieve their ends by giving them the freedom to act on their own judgement and receive the consequences, material and otherwise, of their actions. On this note, D'Souza quotes alot of scholars prior to the fall of the Soviet Union on how well it was doing economically, how good its system was, etc... and shows how they were wrong and Reagan's, by contrast, understanding of the economic weakness of Russia. D'Souza concedes that Reagan was not a brilliant thinker but argues that he had the right ideas, and the character to stick to them and put them through in the face of opposition, criticism, attack.  He had a vision and what others thought and said about him did not deter him. <br />I agree with some of the earlier reviews, as well as the guy from \\"Reason Magazine\\" that D'Souza paints in too broad of strokes and doesn't really portray the weaknesses of Reagan as a man as much as would probably have been accurate. There are passages in the book that make me think that D'Souza's perception of Reagan is slightly overestimating of him, but only slightly. <br />Pleasantly, the book is a good way to pick up on interesting historical happenings of the time period, suchas the Iran Contra affair, the Cold War, of course, as well as some of the economic arguments between supply siders and their critics. D'Souza's knowledge of classical liberal political and economic thinking is honed and so it is a pleasure to get these side treats. The book is also fabulously well written, very clear, no waste, to the point, with just enough flesh on the bones to make it a great read.

The book is divided into TWO PARTS, the first dealing with 12 behavior patterns that are destructive to one's career and the second dealing with the four underlying psychological dynamics that are the root causes of these behaviors.  I find this organization to be very satisfactory from a writing perspective as well as from the standpoint of human psychology, that the roots of our behaviors are in our minds, in what we are mentally.  I read the authors &quot;Discover Your Career in Business&quot; (1997) in October 1999 and it really helped me to understand my own interests and the kinds of positions in business which were a good fit for a person with those interests.  The authors combine a deep knowledge of human psychology with an understanding of how business works, a rare combination.  Ultimately, this is a book about knowing oneself, mastering one's character flaws, and becoming the kind of person one is capable of becoming; it is about self actualization and fulfilling one's potential, specifically in a business career.

Hirsch argues that American education practice has been dominated by the theories of Rouseau and Dewey, focusing less on content, the learning of facts about Western and American history, the sciences, humanities, etc... and more on skills like critical thinking and problem solving.  In Chapter 2, however, Hirsch marshalls psychological evidence that a great amount of background information, knowing these facts, is crucial in being a good readerr, thinker, problem solver; hence, the attack is at a technical level, that one can't become a good reader or thinker without alot of background information, that that is just how it works.  To quote him from the second to last page of the book, &quot;By stressing the essential role of content in reading, this book should have punctured the myth that reading and writing are like bike riding or map reading, skills that require only a narrow range of specific information plus some practice... The skills model of education is illusory, because it overlooks the fact that reading and thinking skills alike depend upon a wide range of specific, quickly available information.  Every citizen needs to have immediately at hand a critical mass of specific information in order to posess that skills of skills which is literacy&quot; (pg 144).      The above is the main thrust of the book, however Hirsh does not believe that education is solely about the accumulation of facts.  He distinguishes between an extensive curriculum, which gives exposure to a wide array of facts, and an intensive curriculum, which specializes on learning a particular subject matter, giving alot of time to one thing.  Hence, the criticism of the reviewer from April 27, 2000 is not totally justified.  He misses the fact that Hirsch feels the need to focus on facts because they are being neglected but does not deny the importance of concentrating in depth and learning to think critically about a given subject.  He does not reject the development of thinking skills but argues that at this point in time a focus on more facts is going to be most profitable for education, &quot;The intensive curriculum, though different, is equally essential.  Intensive study encourages a fully developed understanding of a subject, making one's knowledge of it integrated and coherent&quot; (pg 128).  Or again, &quot;The idea of cultural literacy does not embrace the whole of education.  This book focuses sharply on the background knowledge necessary for functional literacy and effective national communication.  THIS LIMITED EDUCATIONAL GOAL, WHILE NOT THE WHOLE STORY, IS ONE THAT NEEDS SPECIAL EMPHASIS TODAY&quot; (pg xi, Preface).      All that said in explicating and defending Hirsch, I have some reservations about the book.  As long as this is to be only a partial though necessary end of education, fine, but I agree that this kind of superficial acquaintance with facts is not enough to be truly educated, which I think requires the kind of focus and expertise that allows one to think intelligently about an issue for oneself.  Brand Blanshard in &quot;The Uses of a Liberal Education&quot; thinks the existence of shared knowledge among members of a community an important common bond but sees the real aim of education as training minds to be able to think clearly and critically about issues, to become practiced in the use of reason.  Perhaps Hirsch is aiming at a broader audience while Blanshard's message is for a more elite group; or perhaps Hirsch sees the achievement of this ideal by the mass of people as unrealistic.        And I think that begins to touch on my main dissapointment with this book.  While I agree with its main thesis, though the 145 pages book could have been reduced to about 80 pages, it didn't affect me powerfully as an individual, while the two other books on education which I have read, &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot; by Alan Bloom and &quot;The Uses of a Liberal Education&quot; by Brand Blanshard did.  The reason is that Hirsch is concerned with raising the literacy level of the nation as a whole, with stopping the slip in education among Americans, seen as a whole.  While these are important concerns of the other two books, I was able to take away things of a personal value from them.  Bloom's book made me more aware of the intrusion of relativism about values and truth that has intruded into our universities, as well as the historical genesis of that intrusion by tracing our present day situation to the German philosophical tradition.  There were also many tangenital and true insights about contemporary culture and human nature.  Blanshard's book touched me so deeply that I am really not prepared to write about it here.        Summing up, I agree with Hirsch's fundamental point, I think it is well taken, but it definitely could have been said more concisely, as he frequently repeats himself even in a 145 page book, and the personal value to an already educated person who takes his education seriously is rather limited.  Hirsch accomplishes his task, shows his point, though I suppose I'm just not terribly excited about that point.	2000-10-21
US	51759818	R24Y85RU62OFE4	0764551531	543620360	Philosophy For Dummies	Books	4	8	11	N	N	A Very Good Introduction to Major Philosophical Problems	Tom Morris does a very good job of clearly explaining important  philosophical issues and why they are relevant to everybody's lives.   Philosophy is often seen as something completely impractical as well as  totally obscure but Morris writes very clearly and makes a convincing case  that these philosophical issues are important for everybody's quality of  life.        I particularly enjoyed the parts on skepticism, free will,  mind-body and the existence of god.  The last chapter of the part on the  meaning of life is very practical, about what is required for sucess in any  endeavor.  I mention this because there is a good mix of philosophy and a  kind of self help or applied philosophy, information about living (what  Morris calls &quot;wisdom&quot;).  So, the book is clear and easy to  understand but what I like best about it, once again, is the constant focus  on WHY THESE THINGS MATTER FOR REAL LIFE, the tie to real life, the  convincing case that philosophy can help one live better.        The reason  I only gave it four stars is that I got a little tired of his Theistic  position, which gets alot of space, and I didn't think that he alwasy gives  atheism and naturalism a fair rendering.  I think he gives an overly bleak  conception of what atheism entails, implying that either you believe in God  or life is just miserable and bleak.  This is the only part of the book  where I felt his objectivity slipping a bit.        A nice bonus is that  Tom Morris himself is a very happy, very sucessful, guy which seems to  suggest that he has been able to effectively apply his studies and wisdom  to making his own life work.  This comes across loud and clear in reading  this and his other book,  &quot;If Aristotle Ran General Motors&quot;.         All in all, a really good read.	2000-09-18

He is in that top echelon (from what I've read) right up there with Aristotle, David Hume, and Ayn Rand. There is alot to learn from reading his writing, both in terms of content, and most importantly, method.  His approach is to see all sides, be open to new evidence, and honestly search after truth. <br />In this concise 205 page autobiography, Mill gives us a mainly intellectual autobiography of his intellectual development and his writings, as well as the tremendous influence of his father, James Mill, and his wife and most intimate friend, Harriet Taylor. What I got it from it was a picture of a man constantly growing, constantly open to learning, honest, searching, willing to be fallible, and desiring to know the truth.  I don't agree with some of Mill's conclusions concerning socialism and probably some others, but I have the utmost respect for the his reasoning ability and intellectual honesty. This book touched me far deeper than did Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography because while Franklin just seems to relate his own life and events, there seems to be more relection and insight in Mill. As someone who has only read \\"On Liberty\\" and \\"Utilitarianism\\", this is also a great introduction to Mill's thought because he discusess all his writings and he gives alot of background in terms of what was going on his life, in the times, etc...  Brand Blanshard wrote a book entitled \\"Four Reasonable Men\\" and John Stuart Mill was one of them; I couldn't agree more.<br />                 Greg Feirman...	2000-08-21
US	51759818	RH69OZL9WIEKJ	1568494459	614611577	The Ides of March	Books	5	58	61	N	N	Great Drama!!	I really liked Thornton Wilder's &quot;The Ides of March&quot; because of  it's drama and it's philosophical content.   The first thing to note is the  great structure of the book which makes it very dramatic.  The book is  structured into four separate parts and each parts leads up to a scene that  is anticipated throughout the part.  For part I, it is the dinner at Clodia  and Clodius Pulcher's; for part II, it is the reception at Cleopatra's; for  part III, it is the profanation of the mysteries of the goddess by clodia  pulcher and her brother; and for part IV, it is Caesar's assasination.   From the very start of each part, Wilder whets your appetite for how the  climactic event is going to go and I was so anxious to find out what  happened, which kept me turning the pages.   The second thing I want to  mention is the great amount of thought provoking philosophical content in  this concise, 246 page novel.  There is alot of reflection in Caesar's  journal about the rational grounds for religion (a belief in God or the  Gods), there is a passage on living one's life with the knowledge that one  will die one day, and stuff about love and relationships.  Also, there is  alot of character analysis, analyzing Caesar's character, contrasting it to  Cicero's and Junius Brutus's and others.  The fact that Caesar and these  others are these famous historical figures from ancient rome tinges it all  with that feeling that one is gaining an education about the roots of  Western Civilization, in touch with the classics.   My favorite parts are  probably the letters of Caesar to his friend Lucius Mamillius Turrinus  because of the great philosophical content and also the letters at the end  of each section where some other character will describe in a long letter  what happened at the climactic event.   I heartily recommend this book  because of the great drama and philosophical content.  I've read other  books set in the ancient past, such as Mary Renault's &quot;The Lastof the  Wine&quot;, set in ancient Greece during the Peloponessian War, but I like  this one better because there is more drama, more excitement, as well as  more philosophical content, more real wisdom about life.  And it does all  this in 246 pages compared to around 430 for Renault's book.   Any fans of  this book who have recommendations for me please e-mail me!   Greg Feirman	2000-08-12
