US	52676838	RVFOTMDCOTCZC	0553571923	536473441	Breakheart Hill	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A dark and disturbing story	This is the 3rd book that I have read by Thomas Cook and it is a well told story.  However, there are some problems with it.  First there are some loose ends that are annoying and take away from the overall story.  I was also disappointed in the ending and the acutual events of the day in question.  Cook builds up a story around an assumed outcome and then totally changes pace at the end.<br />This worked for his first two books the I read, but fall short here.  The characters in the story are not really developed and I did not feel close to any of them.  I like good characters!  The characters also seemed to have overreacted to certain things in the plot that did not make sense with the actual ending.<br />I still think that Cook spun a good story and it is worth the read, but it lacks the qualities of &quot;Evidence of Blood&quot; and &quot;The Chatam School Affair&quot;.  I still like his lyrical style and do recommend the book.	2002-06-29

I find that the text gives a good view of what catholic have had to face here in the US.  It begins in Colonial times and goes into the 20th century (the book was written in 1981).<br />However, alot of topics are given a brief look with some names and dates mentioned, but no real detail.  This makes the book boring at times and it would really be bad if my instructer didn't explain things more in class.  This is a real good glance at the Church and I would recommend it along with a book that gives much more detail.  The American Catholic Experience by jay Nolan would be a good bet.	2002-03-15

This is the first book by Kurland that I have read and it was indeed a good story that kept me interested for the most part.  The romance between Thomas McKinnon and Iolanthe MacLeod is a good old fashioned love story with a twist--Iolanthe is a 600 hundred year old ghost!<br />The story begins quick and alot of characters (some ghosts)are introduced in the opening chapters and add substance to the story.  Thomas has the ability to see spirits that other people cannot and he strikes up friendships with many of them.  The setting is England/Scotland and after reading this tale I have a strange desire to learn Gaelic!<br />However, there are some bad points in the tale.  For one stories that were being developed in the beginning were left hanging in the end and many questions went unanswered (I hate loose ends!).  The story also seems to speed up near the end and some good ideas were never fully developed.  Since this is part of a larger story by Kurland, I am thinking that maybe these questions were answered in previous books or will be answered in future ones.  I do highly recommend this novel and I will probably read more Kurland in the future.	2002-03-15

The story takes place in 1895 Toronto and is fast paced with alot of twists.  William Murdoch is the detective leading an investigation in the mysterious death of a young housemaid.  During his search for the truth he travels everywhere from the slums to the homes of the rich until he gets his answer.<br />The setting is good, the mystery is intricate and the characters are pretty well developed.  However, some characters are given very little print and there are too many of them to keep track of.  The main drawback though is a very key plot is never explained and there are other loose ends in the story.<br />Being that this is the first in a series leaves me to believe that in future novels some of these things will be dealt with in more detail.  This is a very good debut, but it could have been even better.  I am still going to read the next entry in the series because Jennings has a good thing going here.  I recommend this book.	2002-03-12

I just finished a Nora Roberts book and really enjoyed it.  I had high hopes for this novel.  I have heard alot about what a great writer Deveraux is and how her books sell millions, so I picked up this one.  I could not believe how boring this book was and how bland the characters were throughout the story.<br />This novel was written in 1980 and maybe her talent was not there yet (I never read Deveraux before) when she wrote this particular story.  I didn't even finish this book, it moved to slow and had nothing to offer as far a plot is concerned.<br />So why not just one star.  The history part of the story was accurate and gave a sense of the 1300-1400's and I like history.  I have not given up on Deveraux, but I hope the next book I pick in better than this one.	2002-02-13

I think that is has everything in that goes on to make a great mystery.  There is a complex plot, lots of suspects and a surprise ending.  The main character is  Charlotte Willet, a young widow living in a small New England town in 1763.  She finds herself in the middle of a perfect riddle and manages to come out of it with grace.<br />The supporting characters include her neighbor Rich Longfellow, an aspiring scientist with a Holmes quality to him; his sister Diana, a Boston, pampered lady who is smarter than people think and Lem, a young boy who works for Charlotte and wants to go to Harvard one day.  The whole cast is wonderful and they add color to the overall story.<br />The mystery: a man who just flashed some gold in a local tavern seems to burst into flames and disappear!  This is spotted by a local who begins to weave a strange story.  This whole novel had a old-time flavor to it and is one of the best modern mysteries that I have read.  Oh, by the way, the history is accurate and really places the story in time and place.  I highly recommend this to anyone.	2002-02-13

This is the second book in the series dealing with the return of the powerful Archwizards.  This novel does not pick right up where the first left off and some things were unclear to me.  The plot revoles around Galaeron, the elf mage, Vala, the fighter from Vassa, the city of Shade and the Chosen of Mystra. Shade is trying to reclaim the old land of Netheril, but this is having an affect on the rest of Faerun.<br />I thought that this was a good read with alot of great battle scenes throught the novel.  The main characters were developed more and favorite characters were brought in (the Chosen).  Some of the fights, however, were a little far fetched and the story was choppy in some parts making it hard to follow.  The book was interesting and hard to put down and I would recommend it to anyone.	2002-01-24

The story and the characters were outstanding and the pace was pretty good.  The plot revolves around a mystery that happened in the 1920's (book takes place in the 90's) that is still having an affect on some people.  In 1926 two teachers at Chatham were involved in a forbidden romance which lead to some very disturbing incidents in May of 1927.<br />The writing was dark and depressing at times and the novel did slow down in the middle a bit.  However, the characters were wonderful and I felt myself rooting for the various players at one point or another.  When I can to the end of the book, I was left speechless and stunned.  This indeed is one of the best book out there.  I highly recommend this novel!!	2002-01-24

The story revolves around the Conways, a family with a dark past filled with Voodoo and evil.  They moved into an old Victorian mansion that was left to them by an estranged aunt.  After awhile strange things begin occuring including nightmares and a feeling of a Presence in the house.  Jared, their oldest son, begins changing so that his identical twin cannot even connect with him anymore.<br />The town is also against the family living there because of the strange occurences that have taken place whenever a Conway lived in the house.  The pitch builds throughout the book and climaxes into a good ending.  The problems I had were with lack of character development and some loose ends that were never explained in the end.  But, overall, this is a very interesting book and it was hard to put down.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a good read.	2002-01-11

I am a guy and I heard great things about her writings.  I also seen alot of women reading her books so I was curious to seen what all the fuss is about.  I thought this was a great story with characters that really come to life.<br />The story revolves around Cameron Quinn and Anna Spinelli.  Quinn comes home from Europe after hearing of his foster father's illness.  His dad dies and Quinn is left to care for a 10-year old boy with his brothers.  Anna is the social worker assigned to the case.  Her and Cameron fall in love over the course of the novel.<br />The plot was detailed, the characters strong and (thank God!) it wasn't too mushy with the love scenes.  Robert's writing style is one where she switches back and forth between the characters, looking at things from their perspective.  I was pulling for the two main characters all through the book.  This may have been my first romance novel that I have completed, but I do not think it will be my last.  I have heard of some good things about some author named Deveraux....	2001-12-12

I was not too disappointed, but it could have been better.  This story revolves around Talbot Uskevren, Chaney and Rusk.  Talbot is a good werewolf, Chaney is his shady companion and Rusk is an evil werewolf who infected Talbot in the first place.  They do battle with a weird vampire, his swordmaster brother and a sap named Darrow.  I felt that too much of the plot revolved around Darrow who was just introduced then it did around Talbot.<br />I thought that I would get to know Talbot better by the end of this book, but that was not the case.  Another bad point is that alot of pages went into Rusk and his animal pack out in the woods than the main character.  However, there were some good fight scenes and the faiths of Malar and Selune were made more present to the reader.  I just wish Talbot was discussed more.  The other supporting characters got too much space.  This is still a good read, especially for FR fans.<br />One more thing, alot of the characters in this book are based on The Wolfman (a 1941 Universal horror film).  We have Talbot, Chaney and Maleva. All these had a part in that film which I also recommend.	2001-12-09

The story revolved around the city of Elversult and the interlocking plots of the Cult of the Dragon and the Purple Masks (thieves guild of the city).  Both of these groups are looking to gain a foothold in Elversult by overthrowing the ruler of the city.  The motives and actions of each group were really put on display and helped to form a great backdrop to the characters.<br />The main characters were a half-elf named Lhasha, a fighter named Corin and a Gnome Fendel.  Each one of these characters were fleshed out some with Corin being dealt with the most.  The story of how Lhasha helps Corin regain his dignity is wonderful and the interplay between her and Fendel was fantastic.<br />The actions scenes were realistic and the author had a good grasp of how to describe a battle, whether with swords or magic. I really felt for Corin and was pulling for him from the beginning. The theme of redemption was strong and the ending was perfect for the story.  I would recommend this book to anyone whether they like Fantasy or not.  A great read!!	2001-11-17

I was sorely disappointed with the whole effort.  The story was boring and the characters did not grab my attention at all.  The story revolves around the Tracker family and a curse from the Civil War days.  Trackers are connected by blood and need to feed on other Trackers.  Franklin Tracker goes on a rampage and turns most of the family into vampires throughtout the course of the book.<br />The word &quot;blood&quot; had to be used in almost every other sentence and I got sick of reading it.  The writing was high, no make that grade school level and plastic cutouts would have more life than the characters.  There was a feeble attempt at a romance, between Brianna and Jacob (two main characters), but that failed completely.  <br />The climax was even over too quickly after being built up from the middle of the novel.  This book was simply bad and I would say do not waste your money.	2001-11-17

The plot revolves around a missing housewife and  distraight husband who is trying to find her.  The trail weaves among many different people and ends in a surprise.<br />     This novel was written in 1964 and might seem a little bit outdated to some readers and the two main detectives are not developed yet.  However, the story moves along well and keeps one interested til the end.  A good start to a great series.	2001-11-03

Farber kept me interested and did offer many worthwhile tips to help me.  His &quot;Multiple track&quot; system is wonderful.<br />     The only problem I had was that the book seems outdated being written in the early 1990's.  There was no mention of the Internet and any on the new language tools on the market.  I wish Mr Farber would write a 2nd edition of this book.  I still highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in languages.	2001-11-03

Since this is the first mystery that I have read from Sayers, I had nothing to compare it to and started reading with my eyes wide open, so to speak.<br />The plot is intelligent and sometimes amusing, but Lord Peter could have been better developed as a person.  The supporting cast is good and I look for greater things from Bunter and the bunch in the next novel I read. This novel is written along the lines of a Sherlock Holmes story with great deductions being made with very little to go on as far as evidence.<br />Overall, I found this a great introduction to Sayers and her friend Lord Peter and I look forward to the next novel.	2001-09-18

Artek The Knife is the thief's name and being boring is his game. Artek is half-orc on his father's side and this is the only interesting thing about him. The other characters fall short in most respects, except for Muragh the talking skull and Guss the Gargoyle. Muragh provides comic relief in the story and Guss shows great bravery. The noble and Beckla the mage are not that fascinating.<br />I believe if the characters were more developed this would have been a better read, but they were not and this is not.	2001-09-18

I found the book well paced with interesting characters and a entertaining plot.  However, I thought the book would delve into the psychological mind of the killer and detail why this person kills, but the story only touched on that aspect in some areas. The setting is great and it really gives you a sense of London just after the Great War.  The motive of the killer is generic, but is presented in a unique way.  Overall, a fine read well worth your time.	2001-04-23

This book deals with the return of the greatest spellcasters on Toril, the mighty archwizards of Netheril!  I have high hopes for this series and cannot wait for the other novels to come out.  TSR tried to bring Netheril alive with its Netheril boxed set some while back and a series of novels, but then Netheril just diappeared again without further word.  Now it is being brought back and I cannot wait.  After hearing Netheril mentioned in tons of FR novels, we are finally going to have a series dealing with it entirely.<br />The only fault I had with the story was lack of character development.  I just was not made to feel for the characters as I usually am and I was disappointed.  Mr Denning is a great writer and I wish he would have added more details.  The book, however, is wonderful and promises to start a great line of novels- pick it up!!	2001-04-23

The story revolves around Jack Ravenwild, a &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot;, who manages to get himself in all kind of trouble within the city of Raven's Bluff.<br />The story was presented in the First Person throughtout the entire novel which did not leave much room for other persepectives from the other main characters.  Fanasy novels usually present stories from many different viewpoints which helps draw the reader into the story and give insight as to how the characters play off one another.  This novel does not and it takes away from the story.  I began to lose interest after the first 100 pages.<br />I gave this book 3 stars because it is still a good story that helps deepen the Forgotten Realms Campaign setting (my favorite).  I just wish it was written better.	2001-01-01

One of my favorite characters from that book was Erevis Cale and I could not wait to read this full-length novel that deals with him.  However, I was slightly disappointed when I finally did read this story.<br />The story opens on a strong note with Cale's interaction with the Uskevren Family and then turns into almost a dungeon crawl through a Thieves' Guild.  Cale and his Hafling friend Jak Fleet go to the guild in order to stop a great evil from harming and killing more people.  Most of the book takes place in the guild and it starts to get boring after awhile.  The story then ends on a high note with Cale and his nemesis Riven confronting one another.<br />There are also some loose threads that are not dealt with, for example- Does Cale return to his old job?  What happens to Tazi? and How do the Harpers deal with this?  To sum up, the story started strong, became weak and ended strong.  This is still a wonderful addition to the FR line and Cale is a charater to be watched in the future.	2001-01-01

The central mystery involves the death of a Playwright on a Scottish estate and the cast of suspects that were involved.  The story moves from the estate to various other locations which keeps the reader interested.<br />There were some problems that I had with the story. There were too many characters and sub-plots involved that took away from the main mystery- including the romantic turmoil of Lynley and some past crimes. There was also a conspiracy plot thrown which only took away from the main mystery.<br />I did like the character development and I did feel for Lynley and Havers at various times during the novel.  This is still a good mystery to add to your collection and I will continue to follow this series.	2000-10-29

The story revolves around the fate of some missing paintings that were looted by the Nazis during the war and around the murder of a Boston pawnshop dealer.  Ben Revere is a former curator who travels around the world in order to solve the mysteries. The story flowed well and was an easy read, but the main character, Ben, was hardly developed- I just did not feel a connection with the character.<br />The secondary character, Alex, was better developed in some areas then Ben was and so was one of his buyers, Count Stetten.  The mystery also got complicated in some areas and glossed over in others.  There were also some loose ends left at the end and I hate loose ends in a mystery novel!  Overall, this is not a bad book, but it is no Agatha Christie.	2000-10-29

The only sore point was that a lot of detail was given to Angeligue's time in Martinique with her father, but then as the story progressed the detail  became a summary of the Dark Shadow's series and how Barnabas became a  vampire.  I wish that more detail could have been presented.<br />Parker did a  good job in bringing the series to life and I remembered how good it was-  even the 1991 series was good.

How these six women were  connected is a mystery that is not solved by the end of the book.  The  flashbacks were good but did not reveal many answers as to why these  particular women were picked.  This ruined the novel for me, I don't like  unanswered questions.<br />Another things that confused me was the exact  nature of the witches- they became creatures who returned every 100 years  (1799, 1899, 1999) to exact their toll on humanity, but what were they?   This was not answered either by the end of the book, I did not even know if  the original witches and the creatures were one and the same-  confusing.<br />This is not a badly written novel, it just needed more  development.	2000-05-10

DOD goes in to more detail on the various domains and offers a nice selection  of player classes and races.  The drawbaks that I have include the interior  art and the repeating of some material from other sources.  The interior  art of earlier Ravenloft products is a bit more in tune with the Gothic  setting than the art in DOD.  I wish the would have included a nice map  with the book.
