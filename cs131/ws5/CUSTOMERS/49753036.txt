If you read Ann Coulter's column, then you have already read this book.  This material is old in another aspect as well.  Ms. Coulter has a bad habit of repeatedly attacking straw men; straw men created by herself.  Things are rarely as simple as partisans like Coulter make them out to be.  I don't think the \\"liberals\\" that she writes about even exist in significant numbers, so why waste so much hand-wringing over them?  I mean, who really takes Ted Kennedy seriously anymore?  It doesn't take a sharp wit to call him a drunk.  Most career politicians end up as parodies of themselves toward the end of their careers.  Insular members of the commentator crowd, like Coulter, make the mistake of assuming that these characters represent the average members of society.	2005-08-29

David Henry knows more about red foxes than any other human.  And if you have an almost religious fascination with foxes, Henry is your prophet.  He is obviously charmed by these creatures and is willing to pursue every facet of their behavior to discover the reason for it.  This wonderful book is the product of many years of research, from both his own personal field experience and the borrowed experience of other biologists.  Fortunately for the reader, Henry is also a gifted storyteller.  If his goal was to make red foxes relatable and relevant to our own lives, then he succeeded. <br /> <br />In this revised edition of the book, there are eight pages of color photographs of red foxes.  Further, the scientific evidence gathered by the author suggests that red foxes migrated into North America long before Europeans settled it.  For more fox facts, read this book.	2005-08-25

All organized religions are given the same critical consideration in this book.  While his accounts of the literal Islamic lifestyle are troubling, the documentation of literal Christianity within our own country is just as scary.  Harris lays out the contradictions of literal religious interpretation so well that no reasonable person could walk away from it the same.   <br /> <br />His argument that religious moderation can be just as dangerous as religous extremism is introduced and explored thoroughly.  Although I'm not sure that I agree with his theory entirely, it does have some strong points to consider.  No doubt, this is part of why so many religious conservatives invite him onto TV and radio programs for a shouting match.  But Sam Harris doesn't bite.  His ability to remain calm and respond with perfect reason in these situations is astounding.  That is the small hopeful light I saw at the end of this book.  Common sense and a rational mind will always trump fairy tales.	2005-07-31

I knew it was based on a \\"major motion picture\\" even before the cover told me so, but I didn't know the plot and hadn't heard any reviews of the book or the movie (which is how I prefer to start a novel).  Going into the book knowing nothing about it, I thought at first that the character might be well created, but that I would find nothing in common with him.    Then the book surprised me.  It switched first-person narratives to a young woman, also someone with whom I didn't think I would identify.    This is the magic that Dubus creates, though:  somewhere towards the beginning of the book, I was so wrapped up in each of the characters that I could not put the book down.      I won't spoil any of the plot here, but I will say that a book with what I thought to be a boring -- but poetic! -- name turned out to be aptly named.  The idea for the plot is both realistic and frightening, yet so natural.    I would recommend this book to just about any adult.  I think next I'll see how they transferred this book to the silver screen.    This book definitely makes me want to read another book by Andre Dubus III.    [...]	2005-05-15

We purchased it in preparation for our move to Missouri.  Since then, we have depended on it dozens of times when the state highway maps just weren't detailed enough.  There are hundreds of winding dirt roads and trails in rural Missouri, and this atlas identifies almost all of them.  I also appreciate the index of campgrounds, state parks, and fishing locations.  The only criticism I can muster is the odd proportion of some of the town place names.  There are some tiny towns with huge fonts printed on more than a few of the pages.	2005-04-06

With the possible exception of wilderness protection, he didn't subscribe to the \\"hands-off\\" approach of environmentalism that is often advocated today.  He used to say any experience that reminded us of our \\"dependency on the soil-plant-animal-man food chain\\" was a valuable one. <br /> <br />Through his journal entries, the reader will follow Aldo on hunting and fishing trips.  His entries here are more direct and less philosophical than his Almanac entries.  They are the sharp and admiring field observations of a man taking part in all that the land has to offer.  It is campfire talk with the most influential conservationist of our time.	2005-03-14

In fact, I would say the storyline focuses more along the quickly-developing relationship between a butler and a cop than it revolves around a murder mystery.  But...it worked okay in this book. <br /> <br />Second, the idea of this book and others similar to it -- people with way too much money being murdered and other super-people fighting crime (six-figure butler bodyguards, for instance).  HOWEVER, the characters in this book were down-to-earth.  And the super-rich didn't become the focal point of the story.  In summary, I was sucked into the storyline despite the money issue. <br /> <br />Finally, I thought the plot twists were great, and the developing relationship was great, too, even though I'm not a big romance reader in general.   <br /> <br />I do have a few problems with the book, though:  the whole idea of the strong woman is great but of course she has to become the typical submissive woman in the end (that's my interpretation, but yours might differ); some of the sex was pretty unrealistic (but maybe this made it more fun to read...so maybe this isn't really a flaw per se); and one sexual scene in particular really bothered me (the \\"I-will-force-you-to-make-up-with-me\\" scene)...that was disturbing and made me shudder. <br /> <br />Other than those remarks, I think this book was pretty enjoyable, and I am eager to find out if her other books are as good.	2005-02-20

Since this is the first book I'd read by Carlene Thompson (a present from my mother-in-law), I wondered until near the end if this book was going to be one with supernatural elements.  The characters were interseting enough to keep me reading, but when I'd finally given up and decided, yep, this was going to be one of THOSE books, which was greatly disappointing. <br /> <br />But I kept reading.  And hopefully you will too.  The ending was a great surprise (and not one of THOSE books after all!), and everything came together very neatly.     <br /> <br />What I liked most about this book was Thompson's theme, Black for Remembrance, which was well placed throughout the book.  It was a great hook.  The characters were pretty well rounded, too.  In addition, the surprise ending was perfect: I was convinced I knew who-done-it and was WRONG. <br /> <br />I found very few flaws in the mystery plot of this book, in fact.  I liked it so much, that I will hurry out and find another book by Thompson, hoping it's even half as good!	2005-02-20

The writing style is very likeable, giving this mystery-ish novel a light but slightly heart-stirring feel.  The characters are well done, in a comical style, and the realistic touches add a little weight to the story. <br /> <br />My only criticism of this book is that I thought it would be laugh-out-loud funny.  It IS humorous in the makes-you-smile-on-occasion sort of way, but I don't think I once laughed out loud.  There are plenty of things about this book that are unplausible, as well, but you'll be fine with that as long as you dive in knowing that. <br /> <br />An entertaining first novel.  Would probably read the second one if I happened upon it, but would not go out of my way to look for it.	2005-01-30

So, let me say, that I felt this book lived up to what I expected of it--it was like reading an episode of Law & Order.  Now, to the typical mystery reader, this may not be a good thing. <br /> <br />If you are not familiar with the series, you should know before reading this book that the mystery does not follow a neat and clear path (and I'm not giving anything away by saying this...I'm just generalizing the series, honest).  And, only part of the book is the mystery of whodunnit; the rest is the cops and lawyers putting together their case.  So, if you're not an L&O watcher, be prepared for more details than the ordinary off-the-shelf murder mystery. <br /> <br />Now, if you ARE a fan of the series, you will be pleased to know that the characters we know and love are drawn out, I felt, exactly as they are in the show.  I could practically hear Lennie Briscoe's punchy remarks and Ed Green's computer know-how in the dialogue (Green even \\"Googles\\" something or other).  Serena Southerlyn, Arthur Branch, Anita Van Buren, Emil Skoda, and--my favorite--Jack McCoy are perfectly portrayed as well.  In fact, this is the best part of the novel, watching these characters interact.  Because there is actually even MORE there than in the TV show.  You get a few side glimpses into the characters, like McCoy's womanizing behavior when it comes to his assistant DAs, and you hear Southerlyn's thoughts as a suspect eyes her legs.  This is more than what you get on the show, when the dialogue is all you have to go on. <br /> <br />For this reason, I know Law & Order viewers will enjoy this book.  But I don't think you need to like the show to like the book.  The storyline is solid.  It's not world-class literature.  But I didn't expect it to be so. <br /> <br />I hope I come across more Law & Order books.  This one was gripping.  I can't say that about many other books based on TV.	2005-01-23

I read the first page and decided if the rest of the book came close, it would have to be fantastic. <br /> <br />And it was.  I liked the way Millington spliced the three areas of Pel Dalton's life together:  his crazy-and-always-getting-crazier office; lunch dates with his friends Tracey and Roo; and the arguments he has with his girlfriend Ursula. <br /> <br />This book may not be for everybody.  I tried to get my husband to read it, but he found the arguments tedious.  He said if he wanted to hear meaningless babble, he could argue with me.  (Ha ha.) <br /> <br />Anyway, this book carried me through a 22-hour bus ride back home, and kept other passengers at safe distances by my constant out-loud chuckling. <br /> <br />Even non-bus riders would enjoy this book, I should think.  It is fun and engaging.  You'll either identify with the main character and laugh and laugh...or you'll be thankful you're nobody like the main character and laugh and laugh.	2005-01-17

For a quarter, I felt like I'd give it a shot. <br /> <br />Well, this book was pretty darn entertaining.  Even though Sheila Levine's life was in shambles a generation before me, her story seemed timely.  Lo and behold, my Mom had even heard of this book. <br /> <br />I have never read a suicide note that made me laugh out loud before.  Come to think of it, I believe this is the only suicide note I've ever read.   <br /> <br />I must add that this book got funnier as it went along, with the climax of the book artfully written. <br /> <br />Note that this book has some racier scenes.  Not for the little ones, this book!  But great for reading while traveling, as I did. <br /> <br />Try reading this in contrast to The Bell Jar (maybe afterward...it will pick you right up from Plath's downward spiral). <br /> <br />Another great book in the funny death genre is Final Arrangements by Miles Keaton Andrew.  Completely different, but contemporary and hilarious.  Have fun!	2005-01-17

The story-telling method is very much Judy Blume, but this time it is geared toward adults. <br /> <br />The main character, Sandy, has lived her life according to other peoples' rules and expectations; primarily those of her mother and her husband.  She played it safe and predictable, but now is haunted by regret.  Her husband, Norman, is such a dolt that you wonder how she could have stayed with him this long.  His obsession with appearances at the country club are laughable, and his skills as a lover are nonexistent.  It is not until the final chapters, after Sandy has broken from her cage, that she (and the reader) begins to see there is something valuable in reliable old Norman.  And there is a fun little mystery to solve throughout the book: who is the man on the motorcycle? <br /> <br />Reading Wifey is very enjoyable.  It is touching and humorous, and married readers may find themselves comparing their relationships to those in the book.	2004-12-30

I must confess that we picked it without knowing anything about the book, other than what the back cover said.  We didn't even know that there was an Oscar-award winning movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on the book.<br /><br />This haunting, gothic novel kept us on the edges of our seats.  There were two points of the novel that took us completely by surprise...but looking back, it all adds up.  This book was masterfully written; it is the type you might wish to read again and again.<br /><br />Comments from our book club:<br /><br />Mom:  Didn't fall asleep once (a feat!).  Thought there were a couple of parts that didn't make sense, but after discussion thought it was a good ending (great book to discuss in a book club for that reason).<br /><br />Dad:  Thought Du Maurier's greateset talent was in character development; thoroughly enjoyed watching the heroine of the story as the plot developed.<br /><br />Me:  Definitely one of the best books I have ever read.  The plot twists were great.  Imagery fantastic.  The kind of book that I can't stop thinking about it.  Immense fun.<br /><br />We will definitely get the movie to see what Hitchcock has done with this book.	2004-12-18

This was the first Willa Cather book read by anyone in our Family Book Club, and I speak for all of us when I say we really enjoyed this book.  Cather has a way of pulling you right into the story from the first words, and she brilliantly wove anecdotes and mini-stories into the tale of two young people growing up.  The version of the book we read contained two introductions:  the original introduction which had been placed at the end of the book and an introduction Cather wrote later.  Our Book Club was divided; personally, I liked the re-write of the introduction better.  But it was intriguing to see them both in such a way. <br /> <br />Read My Antonia, and the next time you are driving through the country, past the red grass and into the rattlesnake plains, you, too, will remember Mr. Shimerda at the crossroads.  And maybe also you will recall the thrasher story, the wedding couple and the wolves, and Mrs. Shimerda's secret cow.   <br /> <br />My Antonia is the sort of story that you feel sad to put down, as if the characters you've known are real people and you are forced to say good-bye to people you care about.	2004-10-30

While Deception Point was an interesting read -- I learned a lot and went on a whirlwind ride with Rachel Sexton and company -- it was missing something that the other Brown books have.<br /><br />That something was the code.  The mystery.  That final zinger that usually wows me in the end.<br /><br />Similar to the other Brown books I've read, Deception Point contained engrossing characters, lots of interesting and unknown-to-me facts, and unbelievable coincidences -- almost James Bond-style.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any thriller lover, but beware if you've read other Brown books:  I don't think this was his best.	2004-10-20

Andrews\\" novels after the Melody Logan series, which just didn't grab me like the novels that Andrews REALLY wrote.  But, after so many years, I missed the careful web she constructed in Flowers in the Attic, My Sweet Audrina, and Heaven.  So I picked up the Gemini series.  And I felt that there was something there, a true homage to the original author. <br /> <br />It's true that \\"Black Cat\\" pales in comparison to Andrews' original pen -- she had a style that, no matter how simple or even, dare I say, cheesy, was addictive through and through.  But this book contains a flicker of that original flame, enough to keep you turning the pages. <br /> <br />Overall, I found the storyline of Black Cat to be a little disappointing, and became even more dismayed when I read the excerpt from the next novel in the series, \\"Child of Darkness\\" (or something like that).  And yet, there is still something there, something that made me spin through the entire book in under two days.  Something that will make me pick up the next book in the series as soon as it hits the shelves. <br /> <br />Celeste, forced to take on her brother Noble's identity and act as big brother to her own secret daughter, is a captivating character.  If nothing else, the storyline is unique. <br /> <br />One bothersome point at the end (without giving anything away):  it says that at that point Celeste is 17 and Baby Celeste is 6.  This can't be right.  We were all there when Baby Celeste was born.  Was Celeste really 11 at that time?   <br /> <br />Well, anyway, if you liked Celeste, you will probably like Black Cat, too.  I just wish they would stop talking about the spirits so much.  I could \\"believe\\" in the rest of the story so much more if they didn't focus on their ancestors from beyond the grave. <br /> <br />And I am hopeful that moreancient secrets will be divulged in the books to come.  What will become of Celeste, Baby Celeste, and Panther?  What about the true first Celeste?  This book contains more questions than answers -- but then, the ghost writer got that part right, for that is the trademark of the second book in an Andrews' series.	2004-10-05

I didn't expect to read the greatest book I'd ever read; what I'd expected was a story gripping enough to make me turn away from the computer and just want to read.  That's what I got out of \\"After All These Years,\\" which I think to be a terrible title for what is, really, quite a fun read. <br /> <br />\\"After All These Years\\" is based around solving the crime that middle-aged English teacher (but extremely wealthy by marriage) Rosie Meyers stands accused.  I love a good murder mystery, and this one held my interest, despite the fact that stories surrounded by disgusting amounts of wealth ordinarily make me cringe.  However, Rosie was a down-to-earth yet fallible woman, who mostly held true to the character Ms. Isaacs had created for her (a small flaw being that Rosie was a little too sexually promiscuous to me, considering how she acted in all other situations). <br /> <br />I figured out who had done it about three-quarters of the way through the story...and I'm not the world's best sleuth.  So mystery fans may be disappointed by the easy answer.  However, there were lots of twists and turns in this story that kept me turning pages right up until the end. <br /> <br />In comparing \\"After All These Years\\" to the other Susan Isaacs story I have read -- \\"Lily White\\" -- I liked \\"After All These Years\\" better.  \\"Lily White\\" was an intriguing book, but based less on mystery and more a character study.  Also, \\"Lily White\\" danced between first- and third-person narratives, which became confusing at most and took a lot of my concentration to follow at least.  \\"After All These Years,\\" on the other hand, was told completely from Rosie's point-of-view and in chronological order. <br /> <br />Plus...who wouldn't want to be in (or out) of Rosie's shoes as she, a middle-aged English teacher, scampers about New York on the run from the law, evading the cops and manipulating the enemy into handing over information.  She'll clear her own name and lament overher jerk of an ex-husband, then play footsies with men half her age, all in the same day.  For me, this was quite an escape into a world I am not (or hope not to be) a part. <br /> <br />And once in a while, Rosie will make you smile, if she doesn't make you laugh out loud.  Recommended \\"beach\\" reading.	2004-10-02

After diving into it over a weekend, it became apparent to me that a great deal of effort went into the design and content of this faux-textbook.  The most amusing aspects of the book may be the minute footnotes and sidebars that the hastiest of readers may overlook the first time through.  Perhaps the most caustic section is Chapter 7, which bites into the evolution of mass media and what it has now become.  It sends a clear message to the commercial news outlets: We're laughing at you, not with you.   <br /> <br />Everyone is satirized at some point in the book; even some of the readers, I suppose.  Whomever the target, it is important to remember that satire only works when the portrayal is based in reality.  This book is very effective in that regard, and it should give the targets cause to reflect (if they would only listen).  Given the hours of hearty chuckles it provides, America (The Book) is a hardcover bargain.	2004-09-27

I thought this book might be comparable to Ed McBain. <br /> <br />This book, however, was more character study than murder mystery, in my opinion.  The mystery was still there -- with lots of great twists and turns -- some guessable and some not. <br /> <br />But the thing about Lily White, the book and the person, that made me give the novel 4 stars is that I identified with Lee (AKA Lily White).  Sure, Lee is an ambitious attorney.  Her family (at first I felt I knew too much about them, but this only made the end that much more heartfelt) is nothing like my own (thankfully loving family).  The differences are night and day.  And yet, there is something there, some part of Lee, that I would bet is in all of us.  By the end of the book, I was cursing those who had wronged and conned Lee White, cheering her new beginning at the end and every struggle she had won.  <br /> <br />As this book drew toward the end, I could not put it down!  And then, when it ended, I wanted to know what was next for Lee White.  I could have read another 500 pages.  She had become a real person to me, someone I thought of as a friend. <br /> <br />And that, to me, is the mark of a good book.	2004-09-23

My copy came from a small general store in Minnesota, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it signed by the author.    This is an interesting collection of short stories taken from the author's many years of field work.  These true tales range from humorous to a bit frightening; they are well suited to fireside or bedtime reading for all ages.    My only criticism is a minor one.  The book is not edited very well.  Some of the sentences are punctuated or structured poorly.  This may not be a problem for most readers, but it bothered me.

An avid hunter and student of the land, he believed that the key to any successful conservation movement depended on the cooperation of the small landowner. <br /> <br />His \\"land ethic\\" philosophy branched out to many other relevant topics; such as his argument that wilderness was a valuable cultural resource, as well as being vital to scientific study.  At one point, he asks, \\"Of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map?\\" <br /> <br />The most striking thing about Aldo Leopold to me is that his words only become more relevant and more pressing as time goes on.  This man has some important things to say.  Please listen.	2004-08-31

Sprinkled with humor, Yoshimoto has created unforgettable three-dimensional characters, full of inhibitions and quirks -- just like the rest of us.   <br />  <br />The novellas are a quick read, and my favorite was the first one, \\"Kitchen.\\"  After I had finished this story, I wanted to read more.  What happened next for Mikage? <br />  <br />One thing to note before you start reading is that these stories were first written in Japanese.  The translator has done a fine job with them, but you will notice some metaphors that could not be translated; they just don't work.  The language does not flow in the same manner of a typical English writer, but if you know this going in, you might find as I did that the writing is that much more beautiful. <br />  <br />If you want a book full of suspense and horror, this is NOT the book for you.  However, if you are looking to read something that will make you laugh -- and maybe make you cry -- and certainly feel like life is precious -- pick up Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto.	2004-08-28

Does this sound boring?  On the contrary, it could not be LESS boring! <br /> <br />This is the second novel I have picked up by Dan Brown.  The first was Angels & Demons, which I highly recommend.  In comparison, Angels & Demons had a more satisfying ending and was packed with more suspense.  However, the characters in Digital Fortress were more interesting, in my opinion, and once again, I have learned a lot of little bizarre truths from this book. <br /> <br />Once you've read Digital Fortress, check out Dan Brown's website.  He has some maps of the National Security Agency (had you heard of it?), bizarre true facts from the novel, and other tidbits.  A thriller based in truth is always the scariest to me, and the fact that there are no clear-cut answers in the end will make you ponder privacy issues. <br /> <br />In addition, you will find yourself trying to break the unbreakable code(s) throughout the book.  And then when you get to the last page...watch out.  I still haven't figured it out. <br /> <br />This is a great novel, filled with intrigue, suspense, and revelation.  I recommend it...without wax.	2004-08-23

As far as I can tell, Aldo Leopold's essays fall into two broad categories: those fit for scientific journals or public policy statements, and those that celebrate the philosophical or aesthetic appreciation of nature.  This book contains a healthy dose of both types.  It is full of rich, lyrical essays on the variety and inherent enjoyment of being surrounded by wildland and wildlife.  This is not to say the essays are impractical.  As was often the case, these words were written for the common man; the common landowner.  But Aldo Leopold was a brilliant wordsmith.  He didn't see why a lesson in practical land management couldn't also be poetic.  As such, his words were often profound and prophetic, but also gleaned from what should be common sense.  The final essay in this book (The Land-Health Concept and Conservation)is perhaps the most important and most relevant argument for land sustainability that you will ever read.	2004-08-22

Browse the brief chronologic summary of his life and then skip the lengthy introduction (for now), and you will get to the meat of this book.  It starts with an essay written by Aldo Leopold as a high school student.  From there, the path of essays winds its way like a river through his life, with many stops along the way.  The reader can see how Mr. Leopold's outlook matured and changed over time; from such things as a letter to a newspaper editor, to my favorite: an introductory lecture from the first college course he taught.  What I would give to go back in time and be a student in that classroom!   <br /> <br />Aldo Leopold may be gone, but his body of work remains.  His written work has proven to be prophetic.  We still face many of the same conservation problems that we faced in the early 1900s; some of these problems have worsened.  As a society, we have to realize that we cannot go on repeating our past mistakes.  There are solutions to these problems.  And the words of Aldo Leopold hold some of the answers.	2004-08-21

To be honest, ordinarily, I wouldn't pick up a book like this, as I prefer books with settings in the United States, and am not much of a sci-fi fan (of which, this loosely fits the genre, I think).  I am also not a big fan of books about religion (this book isn't preachy at all, though). <br /> <br />That said, this book was terrific!  The mixture of science and religion is perfect, the plot terribly reasonable and well-researched, and the best part, for me, was the ambigrams. <br /> <br />The illustrated ambigrams in Angels & Demons were created by an artist that shares his name with the story's main character.  It is incredible to look at them, then turn them over to read the same word upside down.  They were key to the plot. <br /> <br />Angels & Demons is a \\"smart\\" book.  You will become smarter while reading it (but...it is written at a level that did not go over my head.  Little things, like how our currency came to be, are fact-based and intriguing.  The plot is based on the possibility of an antimatter explosion that will be like a bomb.  This, too, and the research facility mentioned in the book (CERN) are real.  So is all of the artwork and clues to the mystery described in the novel.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.  Once you begin, you will be immersed in Brown's world of What If.  A true page-turner. <br /> <br />After you read this book, check out Dan Brown's website.  As of the date of this review, the website includes photographs of the artwork used in the book, more ambigrams, and more information on CERN, antimatter, Illuminati, and other fun and interesting things from the book. <br /> <br />If I had two more hands, I'd give Angels & Demons four thumbs up.  I'll definitely be reading another Brown novel.	2004-08-20

My family book club read Sister Carrie immediately after finishing a book about another Carrie -- Carol Kennicott of Main Street.  What a great pair of books to read together. <br /> <br />I found Sister Carrie to be even more readable than Main Street.  To me, this book read much like a soap opera.  The girl who \\"works\\" her way from rags to riches, the tormented (or tormenting?) men she leaves behind. <br /> <br />This is a GREAT book for discussion, because we found that what we thought about these characters changed with each chapter.  We also spent some time trying to figure out what the chapter titles.  The \\"tinder box\\" theme was especially delicious. <br /> <br />Sister Carrie was the type of book that you have a hard time putting down.  What will happen next?  Our group predicted and changed our minds a hundred times.   <br /> <br />I think this novel about a young woman's venture from country life into the city and all of the people she affects is definitely one most anyone would enjoy.  I especially recommend reading it in comparison to Main Street, in which the opposite happens - a girl moves from Minneapolis to rural Minnesota. <br /> <br />Also like Main Street, Dreiser uses personal experiences in Sister Carrie.  In fact, the introduction by Richard Lingeman in the Signet edition was especially interesting to me.  I recommend reading it after you've read Sister Carrie.  Enjoy!	2004-08-15

I picked up this book from the library. <br /> <br />The story of a young widow being stalked in small-town North Carolina was engrossing enough.  The characters were interesting.  Some of them were pretty one-dimensional, including most of her friends.  Sparks tries to give them some personality, but they seem bland and uninteresting.  Mike and Richard, the main character's love interests in the story, were the only characters I really enjoyed reading about.  <br /> <br />The problem with the story is the writing.  A lot of the dialogue seems flat and forced.  Some of it is even comical.  But the storyline is good if simplistic, and I thought Sparks did a good job of introducing new major characters more than halfway through the book -- something very hard to do well. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a good beach read type of novel.  Not something that would make me run out and read another Sparks' novel, but it did keep me entertained.  Thanks, Jennifer, for recommending it to me.	2004-08-07

As noted, this is the story of the developing relationship between a bibliophile in New York and a book dealer in London. I picked up this book at a used bookstore, never having heard of it before, and was instantly hooked.        The best part of this book is that Helene Hanff -- who is also the writer of the letters -- includes letters from people other than the book dealer, who also have an appropriate place in the story. There are her friends who go to London and visit the bookstore; there is the book dealer's wife; and there is the old woman who lives near the book dealer, too. Over twenty years' time, you get a peek into the lives of these people and how they affected each other. The epilogue (one final letter giving permission for Helene Hanff to Frank Doel's letters) was an especially nice touch, as it gives the book closure and ties things together with a sad but sweet ribbon.        My final question is: how did she go about getting the mail she sent out? Was it returned to her, or did she mimeograph it? I noticed there are some letters missing -- alluded to in other letters but not in the book. But how did she get letters she sent to people who moved to Australia and were never heard from again, etc.? A little curiosity there, as I have never made a copy of a letter I'm sending out...        If you want a quick but memorable book, please give Ms. Hanff's a read.	2004-08-01

I would share it with my own, but each parent should read this book for him/herself first to make that decision, before sharing it with the little ones.<br />Even if you think the topic is a little too sensitive for your kids at this time, I recommend holding onto it until your little ones are ready -- or just buying a copy for yoursef.  Because this book is excellent in all regards.  It is well written, the plot is clear and funny, and the illustrations are...well, absolutely stunning.  I picked this book up for myself.  Once in a while, I will sit down, and literally put my fingers on the pictures.  They are works of art.  I like to read sections aloud, because the rhyming structure is so pleasing to the tongue.  <br />There are very few children's books that still hold my attention.

Add to it, Hammet's return...and a little love for our hero Arly, and you've got another great tale of mystery and tomfoolery in our favorite Ozark town.<br />Will Dahlia ever see her granny again (and will Kevin Buchanon be sleeping on the sofa forever)?  Will Hammet convince Arly to take him home for good?  Will Harve ever get to watch his poetry in skin-tight clothing?  Will Mrs. Jim Bob drink wine...in her own house?

Andrews -- specifically the Flowers in the Attic series and the Heaven series.  Andrews could spin a story with mystery, secrets, love, incest -- and all of it would work together so beautifully.  Honestly, there are no authors I have found that are comparable in style to V.C. Andrews.<br />Consequently, I was disappointed with the books that were written &quot;in her honor&quot; after she had passed away.  At first they were all right, as if she had outlined them to begin with.  Gradually, they didn't hold my interest anymore.  They were lacking...something...<br />Celeste brought back the old feelings that so well reminded me of the author of the spellbinding My Sweet Audrina.  As if someone had studied Andrews well enough to truly mimic that style that entrances you to turn page after page.<br />The storyline promised much -- and made the book a quick read.<br />What was missing in this book, however, was that ray of light.  One bad thing after another befalls Celeste Atwell.  I thought by the end that there would be some glimmer of hope for Celeste.  I walked away feeling dismal about the entire experience.  Will I read Black Cat, the upcoming sequel?  Probably.  But I wish there had been some small happiness for Celeste in this book - like Heaven's Logan or Cathy's brother Chris.  <br />Anyway, I found this book better than the past few novels in V.C. Andrews' name.  The storyline carried the book for me.  If you liked Flowers in the Attic, give this one a chance.	2004-04-12

The reason for my reluctance was the subject matter - churches and organists.  Sounded boring.  I know very little about either of those things and couldn't imagine wanting to learn more.<br />Well, once I started reading, I couldn't put this book down!  I loved the characters (Rosie, Alan, Pip, Charlie, Harold Oates, Barbara Inch, even Debbie Buffington), and I was completely taken by surprise at the end -- yet it all added up so perfectly.<br />In addition, I must mention once again that the illustrations really add to the book, especially with the look of the organs and the architecture.  Because they are created by the author, they give a great insight into her perception as she is writing, yet she never reveals so much that your own imagination of the happenings is affected.<br />Kudos to another fine mystery by Jane Langton!  I will be returning to the library for another Homer Kelly mystery ASAP.	2004-04-02

Langton has really done her research here, with all of the details and maps of Nantucket, the Biblical and Moby Dick references, and the details of sea ecology and tides.  <br />Some of this information was a little too complex for the non-seafarer, especially regarding the sea ecology and tides.  I admit that I skimmed some of it, and I believe I came away from the story with the same understanding of the murder mystery.<br />In general, I recommend this book.  If you are perplexed by the jargon as I was, skim over those parts and enjoy Kitty Clark, Homer Kelly, and the menagerie of characters presented in this well-told tale.<br />This is the second book I have read in the Homer Kelly series.  I loved The Escher Twist, and I will probably read another of Langton's books in the future.  Even if it is full of over-my-head jargon.	2004-03-14

I picked this book up from the New Mysteries section of my local library, based entirely on its intriguing cover (yes, I judged the book based on its cover).<br />Having never read Jane Langton before, I knew only what the back of the book stated.  After reading it, I am ready to rush out and find more of her books.<br />I give this book five stars because it grabbed me.  And it grabbed me right away.  The characters were fascinating from the get-go, especially the way they were introduced.  I have never been to Cambridge, but I felt that Langton painted the town with vibrant yet surreal colors.<br />In addition, this book contained a lot of math concepts that I did not know about before, but were presented in such a way as to not seem confusing or above my head.  In fact, I had to make my own Moebius Strip just to see for myself how wonderful they are.  The theme was well carried in this book.  Big thumbs up!  A mystery like no other I have read.  Cannot wait to read another one.	2004-02-25

At first glance, this paperback book appears to be a lightweight study guide.  Upon reading it, however, you will find it to contain a mountain of technical information.  Every page offers so many relevant details that you will need to read it twice, just to absorb them all.  Fortunately, it is not written in a dry, jargonistic manner.  As the title implies, the scientific principles involved are simplified for easier digestion and application.  This makes the information all the more useful.  And although it is not a full-fledged textbook, a prospective reader will still benefit from having a basic knowledge of chemistry before opening this book, because it is not a kids' book either.  Take some notes as you read, and you will find it be a real learning experience.	2004-02-25

She said she could not empathize with the main character, and didn't care what happened to her.<br />Dad enjoyed the imagery, and said he would like to read some of her poetry.  He also enjoyed her observations, which were at times witty and clever.  But he felt the book was lacking.<br />Then there's me.  I really enjoyed The Bell Jar, finding it to be a real page-turner, even if not the greatest book I have ever read.  After reading the biography in the back of the book, I have to think that Esther Greenwood and Sylvia Plath are one and the same.  <br />One interesting point of The Bell Jar is that it can be interpreted in many ways, but one doesn't have to TRY to interpret it in order to understand and enjoy the story.  That is, it can be read on many levels.<br />The content of this book is at times shocking, so I would steer the very faint of heart and children away.  It's a good, easy read, and it paints a picture similar to Girl, Interrupted or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  If you like a good, psychological study, you might want to read The Bell Jar.  I also suggest The Bell Jar to a book discussion group, as there is plenty to talk about as the story moves along.	2004-02-20

Great for all ages.  And these puzzles are great for improving your logic skills.<br />2.  Language independent.  Anybody from anywhere around the world can complete these puzzles.<br />3.  They turn into a picture.  This is a big factor.  Unlike a crossword, where you feel satisfied for having solved it but done is done, each Paint by Numbers puzzle turns into a picture.  It could be an animal, a person, or an entire scene.  This book contains a little of everything, in fact.<br />This book of puzzles is great because there are many puzzles to keep you satisfied.  A person who has never done a Paint by Numbers puzzle before can look at the diagrams to see how it's done (or read the instructions and tips provided in the book) and start immediately with an easy puzzle.  The best part is, as the puzzles get bigger and more challenging, the pictures get better and better.  There are some incredible pictures to be completed, and to me, they are art when they are done.<br />I recommend this book to anyone of any age.  If you buy this book as a gift, a great present to accompany the book would be a mechanical pencil with a good, soft lead and a nice eraser.<br />Before you buy this book, you can take a look at this type of puzzle.  One great website is that of Conceptis Puzzles at [...]  Conceptis creates many of the picture-forming logic puzzles contained in Games Magazine, and at their website, you can download a few free weekly puzzles or play them online.  (They are called Pic-a-Pix puzzles at the Conceptis website.) <br />After you've visited this website, I'm sure you'll be as addicted as I am.  I have owned this particular book of Paint by Numbers for about three years now, and have shown it to quite a few people.  They in turn are now as addicted as I am!  Really, this is a great collection of puzzles, and I suggest you give them atry.  Have fun!	2004-02-15

A dedicated individual could no doubt garner symbolism, themes, and the basic plot on his or her own.  But the story is so complex, I think you get a lot more out of it in a group, where the ideas can be shared and brainstormed.<br />Whatever the case, I recommend reading this book.  Faulkner's look at the people and their environment of the South is amazing, and it is one of those books that you will find is often alluded to in other works.  Spectacular book.	2004-02-12

Charlotte Temple is more complex than at first meets the idea, and yet the reader breezes through the reading.  It is a great book for a discussion group, as there are many aspects of this book that can be discussed just as deeply as Hemingway or Steinbeck.  I recommend giving Susanna Rowson a try.	2004-02-06

We've all been there at some point, and this book is outstanding.  I also feel like it's a great way for kids outside of the Jewish faith to get that small perspective of what it is like for a Jewish child at Christmastime.  It's one of those books that I remember fondly and remember well, even though I haven't read it in twenty years.	2004-02-06

As you have no doubt read the description supplied by the publisher, I won't rewrite it here.  I will just say that while other humorous mystery writers use the same storylines over and over, Hess comes up with fantastic new ideas each time.  I loved this story about the Green Party, and I love the recurring characters in Claire Malloy's life -- in this case, Miss Parchester.<br />Even if I had guessed the ending of Out on a Limb before the last page of the book, I enjoy the style of Hess' writing so greatly that I cannot wait to see what Claire will do next.<br />If you like the Maggody books or have read the other Claire Malloy books, I recommend this one.  It's a light, easy read that will at times make you Laugh Out Loud Caron Malloy-style.	2004-02-06

Literally.  A coworker of mine set the hard cover version of this book on my desk because she had lost my Harry Potter book.  In all honesty, I did not consider it a fair trade because I don't like hunting and I don't like fishing and Harry Potter.  C'mon!  Doesn't compete!  AND what was this book about, anyway?<br />Well, without any bias and VERY low expectations, I loved this book, and read it in two days' time.  I loved it so much that after I returned it to my coworker (who miraculously recovered my Harry Potter, thank goodness), I went out and bought another copy and sent it to my best friend in Florida.<br />Hopefully, my Florida friend kept the chain going.  This is a great book, and if the stories make you think that Jane has a low self-esteem, well, she does.  I think that is more realistic than Smug Marrieds might realize (or not, as I am one of Those).  But I suggest giving this book a chance.  It's a good one, even with its misleading title.	2004-02-06

The witty writing, light but intelligent style, and intriguing mystery combine to make a great, fast read.<br />Hess' humor is so enjoyable, and I love the fact that Claire Malloy is a bookstore owner and that the series has nothing to do with cooking.  Hess is definitely a unique voice in the mystery world.	2004-02-06
US	49753036	R3GXW9IW9T4F6G	0671685635	207023183	Ghost Story	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Spooky	After I read this book, I was recommended Dean Koontz's &quot;Door to December.&quot;  In comparing the two, Door to December was not scary to me, nor was the ending (in my opinion) surprising or innovative.  Typically, I don't like stories that deal with the supernatural.  But Ghost Story is different.  It is a book that draws you in right away, and the entire story is chilling, from beginning to end.<br />My favorite part of this book is how the ending ties to the beginning.  All through the book I tried to figure out how the first part fit in with the rest of the book, and I thought how it ended up was terrific.  A great read!	2004-02-06

I will just point out two things that I think the person who reads this book should know (especially if the reader is anything like me):<br />1.  The book starts out sort of slow.  I read the beginning and wondered what I had gotten myself into.  In fact, it started out so slow that I would have put it down had it not been required reading.  I urge you to keep reading!  The book is a classic for a reason, and it is good.  Eventually, it turns into a real page-turner, and you want to find out what happens next to the Joad family.  Later, you will want to check out what other people have said about this book.  I never would have gotten all of the Biblical allusions or other symbolism without reading and discussing this book with others.<br />2.  The ending will surprise you.  It shocked me.  I definitely won't spoil it, but the ending of this book left me, quite literally, jaw wide open.  WHAT? I thought.  Oh my gosh!  I was glad I had someone to talk about it with, because even in today's world, I'm sure most people would find it shocking.  And it is nothing like the movie.<br />That's my two cents.  This book is a great addition to your literary knowledge, and if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it, from both the literary angle and the historical perspective.	2004-02-05

We picked it based on its Amazon reviews.  <br />In general, I found that this book lived up to what the reviewers said about it.  It was funny, poignant, and very different from anything else I had ever read.  It was a good, light choice for our book club, as it brought up numerous subjects for discussion.  Thanks to Final Arrangements, we have all decided we would rather not die.  Especially in the 1970s.<br />Seriously, if you have a weak stomach, some of the contents of this book will no doubt be disturbing.  But this book is a fine page-turner, and when it is over, you will find yourself better off for having read it.  The characters, for the most part, are dynamic and interesting, and the subject is more fascinating than I would have imagined.  <br />As a side note, this book takes place in a fictional town by St. Petersburg, Florida.  Many local places are mentioned.  For those who have ever visited or lived by the Tampa Bay area, these details give the story an extra spark.	2004-01-31
US	49753036	RDLNZUZHBHILB	1586420755	680088296	Howard Dean: A Citizen's Guide to the Man Who Would Be President	Books	4	23	24	N	Y	Topical Outline of Dean	There are several books out there on the shelves about, or authored by, Howard Dean.  I chose this one because it was written by independent observers; people who are not connected to the Dean Campaign for President.  I wanted an objective account of the his background and his political record.  That is exactly what I got.<br />The first few chapters that detail his adolescent years are kind of dry, but informative.  This book changes speed and gets interesting as soon as it tackles his public service career.  His political record is one of a fiscal conservative, and a proponent of states' rights.  If it wasn't for his passion for universal health care and land conservation, you might think he is Republican.  He balanced the budget in Vermont, and when almost every other state had a budget crisis, his state was financially comfortable.  At the same time, he was able to attract new business to the state, expand health care coverage, and protect wild lands from development.  This book has a separate chapter for many separate issues, which enables the reader to study specific items of interest, and pass over those of little concern. <br />The mass media has painted Howard Dean as a left-wing liberal.  Part of this stems from the Dean Campaign's attempt to unite the Democratic base.  But the other factor in this misrepresentation is the Vermont civil unions law.  Howard Dean did not write this law, but he did sign it.  His postion being that he supports equal protection under the law.  As the book explains, Dean is not a social radical, but simply felt giving equal legal rights to same-sex couples was the right thing to do.<br />The final chapters of this book attempt to explain the \\"Dean phenomenon,\\" including his use of the Internet as a major campaign tool.  And since the book was finished and rushed to publishers in the fall of 2003, the material is topical and will still be useful throughout the election year.	2004-01-07

This book does a very good job of covering them all.  Any one of the chapters could be expanded into a book in itself.  This thoroughly researched and written book is for the person who wants all of their information in one place.  It is a textbook for the technically minded arborist, tree surgeon, tree farmer, or hobbyist.  Don't look for this book to be entertaining or philosophical.  Instead, buy this book for the knowledge held within.  There is a lot to be learned from it.  Every single page is filled with facts, figures, methods, and recommendations.  You will find yourself reading every page a second or third time in order to catch it all.  I refer back to this book on a regular basis, because there is no way I can remember it all.  If you have any questions about the management of trees or shrubs, you will likely find it in this book.	2003-06-24

However, for some reason, I never read The Yearling until I was in my 20s.  I am sorry that I waited so long.  This book enveloped me to the point where I almost became part of the story.  Maybe that is because I grew up rural, and found my happiness and contentment among nature, like Jody and his father do.  Jody's father is a very admirable character.  He struggled through terrible adversity while growing up, yet is a very caring and soft-spoken father to his only child.  He wants to give Jody an enjoyable childhood because he never had one.  That is the basic premise of this book.  A young boy making the bumpy transition between childhood and adulthood.  He wants both, but in the end, must choose.  Even before reading the book, you know that the boy will have a pet deer, but that doesn't enter the story until at least halfway through the book.  And I feel that is only a small part of the main plot.  There is much more to reflect upon than just the boy-deer friendship.  One final note:  Another fun part of this book is locating on a map all of the landmarks in Central Florida mentioned in the story.  That makes the story seem even more real.  The Florida in this book is much different than the Florida of today though.	2003-01-26

Haunt Fox is my favorite, mainly because I am so interested in red foxes.  If you are familiar with Mr. Kjelgaard's work, this book will be about what you expect it to be- a solid, interesting story about a boy and his fascination with a legendary fox.  If you aren't familiar with Mr. Kjelgaard's work, this book will be an excellent introduction to his classic series.  What I like more than anything else about this book, and all of his books, is that the writing comes from the viewpoint of the wild animal involved.  I am quite a student of nature myself, and I can tell that Mr. Kjelgaard was too.	2002-12-19
