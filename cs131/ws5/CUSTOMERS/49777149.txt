I never was a big reader....Playstation 2, Cable TV, listening to cds & the internet was where I spent my downtime. Then I read my first Gemmell novel, \\"White Wolf\\", one year ago. My next book was this one, \\"Legend\\".  Since then I have read every book of his I could get my hands on until I had read them all.  This book (and the every book of \\"Drenai Tales Series\\") is/was major science fiction/fantasy triumph. I could go on & on about how great Gemmell is, how great the characters are, etc, etc and it would all be true. But the main reason I love his books is that he puts you there, right there in the story. He takes you away from the sick kids, the fight you had with your wife, the bad day at the office, whatever your \\"ill\\" of the moment is and transports you into a world of heroic fantasy that seems all too real. It might be the fact he Gemmell touches on so many relevant human traits such as honor, loyalty, honesty, courage, friendship, respect that seem to be lacking in today's fast paced, \\"me first\\" society. Reading Gemmell puts me in a world I want to be part of and experience first hand. A world I wish could spill over into our modern one. <br />Anyway, enough rambling. If you are a Gemmell fan, purchasing this  book is pretty much a no brainer and you shouldn't even be reading this. If you are a person who has never read any of Gemmell's work, purchase this book along with every book of the series and save yourself some cash on shipping.  Even check out zSHops for some great prices on used copies.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.	2005-07-04

This book is a must have for any fan of UFO or Michael Schenker.  \\"Shoot Out The Lights\\" covers the bands entire career from the semi-dreadful spacerock of  UFO \\"1\\" to the present.  Every album gets it's own spin here with direct quotes from the band members themsleves.  The insightful quotes, stories & reviews are too numerous to mention, but will provide more than one epiphany for any \\"true\\" UFO fan.   The book's delvings into the psyche of  the \\"enigma\\", \\"The Mad Axeman\\", aka Michael Schenker are worth the purchase price alone.  If you've have read Martin's book on Blue Oyster Cult, this one is written in a similar style; and is just a good.   If you haven't read Martin's book on BOC, buy it now along with \\"Shoot Out\\" and save on shipping.  Better yet, head over to MP's website and get yourself personalized, autographed copies from the Lester Bangs of the new millenium himself!  BONUS!!	2005-06-23

Of course I use the term \\"non-fiction\\" very, very loosely.  Any RAW fan may know why!  This book may be Wilson's most accessible to the uninitiated reader (although it must be approached with an open mind, oblique sense  of humor & a few grains of salt).  Cosmic Trigger may be  the type of book that can  alter your perception of the world and force you into a new sense of reality.   Those two factors alone  may be enough to read it.  Plus, throw in RAW's sense of magick, mysticism, & dark humor as an extra bonus!

Martin Popoff finally sheds a floods worth of light on one of thee best rock bands, Blue Oyster Cult (i.e. before Albert departed).    I totally agree with all the other reviewers.  This book is a must have, a \\"must must\\" have for any BOC fan.  From  \\"Transmaniacon MC\\" to \\"Good To Feel Hungry\\", all the songs are here.  Each album & song are broken down & disected by the humans that matter, the members of the band themselves (as well as cowriters, producers, managers et alia).  For someone who bought the first album back in '72 and has listened for to BOC for 3 decades plus, Popoff's book has been an epiphany for me. The chapter on the Imaginos album alone makes this book worth it.  Go to Popoffs website & get yourself an autographed copy (don't report this)!  Buy this book!!  I swear on my vinyl copy of \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" you will not be disappointed.	2005-02-12

I can't say many positive things about this book that have not already been posted.  But from my personal view, \\"Killer Angels\\" is one of the best novels I have ever read. <br />Most of what I knew of Gettysburg was from high school history and a few documentaries here and there.  This book brings history to  life by drawing the reader into the personalities of the participants.  The most profound thing I came away with upon completion of the novel is how one man's decision or indecision at a specific moment in time can influence history.  I strongly recommend this book to everyone, even readers not interested in war novels per se.  This is novel about people & humanity, the battle of Gettysburg serves as a back drop.  10 stars if I could.	2005-01-14

The first thing that came to my mind when writing this review is the term \\"dark comedy\\"...well this book by Glen Cook can be considered \\"dark fantasy\\".  Cook's book is  not about fairies, trolls & princesses.  There's a lot of \\"R\\" rated issues like murder, killing & rape here so this is not really a book for younger readers.   The characters as dark and somber and the book really delves into their internal struggles and personalities.  Cook's writing does a great job of bringing such character issues to light.  A bit more of a meticulous read than most fantasy books;  there's really not many wasted words here.  I found myself having to read more carefully art the beginning  to comprehend the story.   But once you adjust to Cook's writing style the book flow much better after about 50 pages or so.   If you enjoy books by authors like David Gemmell you'll really enjoy this book & series.	2004-08-20

Weak conspiracy theories aside, this second book in the \\"Chronicles\\" trilogy  is a much better read.  The pace is faster, the writing more concise and the characters much more developed (and interesting).  In the first book, I had to read several passages twice just to get a clear picture of what was happening.  Donaldson's desription of the landscapes are much more vivid and come to life off the pages; again, no so in book number one.  Lastly, as a reader, I actually cared about  several characters in this book and what fate might befall them.  I highly recommend any fantasy reader to plow through \\"Lord Foul's Bane\\", to get to this book. Yes, there are many Tolkien \\"rip-offs\\" here, but who cares. Imitation is the highest form of flattery.  Heck,  Keith has been ripping off Chuck Berry riffs for years.   Anyway, after you finish this, you'll want to move on to book three  ASAP. I just finished book three and it's the best one of the entire trilogy!	2004-08-15

First, forget the overblown, wordy, and tedious \\"Left Behind\\" series.  If you want inspiration in print, look no further than this book (or any by Myers for that matter).  The character development is excellent. By the end of the books, you feel like you know the characters personally.  The messages presented here are clear and not preachy like the \\"Left Behind\\" books. Very inspirational and wonderful at putting old religious ideas in a modern context.   A must read.	2004-08-13

This book started out a very, very slow read...\\"ennui\\" as my high school English teacher would say.  I often found myself reading the same passages twice to understand the plot. I almost gave up to reread a David Gemmell novel.  I stuck with Donaldson; and the book does gather steam about half way through.   Donaldson's writing kept improving with each turned page.  Whether or not this was intentional, I do not know. Plus, after reading and seeing the Lord Of The Rings, you can't help but see how many ideas from Tolkien's work are lifted for this story.  The main problem with this book is there is really no character to \\"root\\" & \\"cheer\\" for.  The \\"anti-hero\\", Thomas Covenant is portrayed as a whiney, uncompassionate @ss who actually rapes a girl in the first 100 pages...some \\"hero\\".   There were times during this book I wished Covenant would just jump off the cliff or just get blown  away. Anyway, I just finished the second book of the chronicle and it is much better than this one.  I am starting the third and so far it is even better!  Unfortunately you need to plow through this one to  appreciate the follow-up book, \\"The Illearth War\\".  Haven't reviewed it yet, but it's worthy of at least  four stars. <br />Too bad there's no \\"Cliff Notes\\" for this one.	2004-08-09

The story lines are well written and despite the 900 plus pages, it is a very enjoyable fast paced read.  The short chapters focusing on an individual character at a time keep the book flowing and moving forward quickly.  And, like TV soaps, the plotting, scheming and backstabbing (literally in this case) are first rate!  However, if you enjoy reading  books (a trilogy in this case) that come to a conclusion, ending or finale, best look elsewhere.  After 3 books and almost 2500 pages, you would think the &quot;R.R.&quot; could have finished what he started, not.  The book ends with more unanswered questions than answered ones.  Most of the storylines woven throughout the book are left hanging with no closure.  I guess the reader will have to wait for the next installment of the series to find out &quot;who shot J.R.&quot;.  Personally, I am looking forward to the next book; but,  I still can't decide if Martin's choice of the initials &quot;R.R.&quot; is blasphemy.	2004-03-20

Yes the story idea is very good, but the character degvelopment left much to be desired.  Dozens of pages go on & on with the sole purpose of showing the writer's knowledge of 1860's history &  Civil War facts.  Nothing was added to the story by this; and it was very boring (I could care less how a grain mill worked in 1865).  I will not give away the ending, but anyone with even a little imagination could see it coming 2/3 of the way thru the book.

Don't ask me why, but when I was about half way thru this book I started skimming page after page. Similar story lines rehashed over and over, yet written from a slightly different character perspective to appear a little different.  Lots of wordy paragraphs with no real action.  It reminded me of reading the long drawn out \\"Left Behind\\" series.   In defense of Lumley, he most likely felt compelled to explain the same past events over and over in every book of the series.  With this being the 8th book, most of it ends up being a rerun for the faithful readers.  Also trying to combine horror, science fiction, romance  and  spiritual themes in one book was just too much.  Too many loose ends.  I was bummed when finishing the first five books of the original Necroscope series, because I was left wanting more.   With this trilogy I glad I done and am going to take a break from Lumley for awhile.  Obvously you can't read the first two books and not this one.

He's supposed to be an extremely knowledgable, brilliant &quot;terrorism&quot; expert, but by the end of the book he's portrayed as an old fool.  Maybe I missed some elusive underlying point, but I was very disappointed.  Thomas's writing reminded me of  the John Grisham novels I have read.  Great, fast paced reads with highly identifiable characters, but alas....quick spurt endings with very little thought.	2003-03-02

This book is so wordy and full of redundant adjectives, you can read the first sentence of every paragraph and be done in about an hour. The publisher obviously pays by the word.  The story? We're in trouble, call Chang. Rivers of blood. Another curse. Car wrecks....jeesh!  This almost reads like a comic book.  Check the book out for two weeks and feel good about yourself when it's back in the book return within 48 hours.  Very, very weak.	2003-02-09

However the story is entertaining and the book is a fast pace easy read.  Kinda like People Magazine.  Grisham's book &quot;The Firm&quot; is my favorite, so if a beginner to his work, I'd start there.	2003-02-09

Looks like Zukav is a Cuba Gooding Jr. fan,   because from now on it's \\"Show me the money\\" for him.  I suspected that when I wrote my review of \\"Soul Stories\\" the \\"soul\\" topic was just a money maker and not something the author really believed in.   Zukav went 20 years between his first and second book.  Now he's pumping out books  faster than Aerosmith puts out \\"Greatest Hits\\" cds.    I am convinced he is milking the \\"soul\\" for all its worth....Zukav must be hanging out with  Tim LaHaye &  Jerry B. Jenkins of \\"Left Behind\\" fame. If you want religious inspiration read Bill Myers' \\"Eli\\" or \\"Fire Of Heaven Trilogy\\".	2002-08-11

It seems to go on endlessly with the author's personal experiences. Almost like she's trying to convince herself as well as the reader that this disorder really exists.   My wife purchased this book on sight at a local book store. She read the cover flaps and hoped we might gain some insight on how to help our son. You can't judge a book by the cover. There is very little material here (except for a few very basic and vague techniques) one can apply to actually helping someone who has or is suspected of having APD.  There's almost 200 pages gone before anything even remotely practical on treatment is written.  Actually, most places in this book where the term \\"APD\\" is written,  you could substitute \\"PDD\\", \\"ADD\\", \\"ADHD\\" or whatever the fad diagnosis of the month is.  It would still read about the same.  If you have a child with learning disabilities I suggest William Shaw's book  \\"Biological Treatments for Autism and PDD\\".  Shaw's book demonstrates concrete ways on how to help you child.   This book left us with more questions than answers.  ...	2002-08-11

I always sit thru the entire movie, listen to the entire album and finish every book I ever start. With one exception. I did what \\"I wilt\\" and returned this to the library after 50 pages. The book starts out very slowly and stays at a \\"snail's pace\\" page after page. Very little is revealed about the occult & magick aspects of Crowley's life.   If you really need to know about Crowley's life this book is really the only one available, so I quess you could consider it a must read for that reason alone.     .	2002-08-09

Then I got to the part when Marcinko starts bragging about his Viet Nam days. He goes out on patrol at night, swims in the dark and kills 4 or 5 Viet Kong. Big [...] deal! A few dead bodies here, a few there... How in the [...] did that make one bit of difference in a war that was a mistake to begin with! This book is a \\"me...me...me\\" story; I guess if you can get by this Marcinko's ego it is not a \\"bad\\" read.  But there are so many other great books out there, I'd recommend a pass on this one.	2002-08-09

These books are concise, to the point and there is not a wasted word to be found.  The character development is excellent.  By the end of the books, you feel like you know the characters personally.  I kept picturing Nicole Kidman and Sarah and the actor from the TV series &quot;Smallville&quot; as Brandon.....anyway I digress.  I read thru all three books in about a week and a half.  The messages are clear and not preachy like the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books.  Very inspirational and wonderful at putting old religious ideas in a modern context.  Check out his book &quot;Eli&quot;...also excellent.<BR>A must read.	2002-02-01

Moves along quickly with excellent character developement. Grisham could  have spent a little more time developing a less disappointing ending, but was most likely in a hurry to pick up his paycheck.	2001-03-10

But there was this nagging feeling that I had been scammed.  I could'nt help but wonder if Zukav really believes what he is writing about or whether he has hit a goldmine with this topic due to his association with Oprah? We'll  see by how long he milks it.  Zukaz went 20 years or so between his first  and second books. If his output starts to rival Marvel Comics I quess we  know who really has &quot;soul&quot;. My vote is for James Brown.	2000-04-30
