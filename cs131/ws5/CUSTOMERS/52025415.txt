This is a good example of her writing, perhaps not as good as &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; or &quot;Lorin Jones&quot;, but well worth reading.<br />Like most of Ms. Lurie's novels, this one has a great sense of place (New England), characters you can care about and periodic flashes of humour. It's not exactly set in academia (cf. &quot;The War Between the Tates&quot;), but a New England university is at the centre of the novel. The almost mystical relationship betweeen Convers College and its graduates / staff is beautifully evoked, as are some of the petty bitching between its academics. By the end of the novel, I felt I'd been there.	2001-05-20

No-one with any love for literature should fail to read &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot;, &quot;The Collector&quot; and especially &quot;The Magus&quot;. Unfortunately he ran out of inspiration after &quot;Daniel Martin&quot; and this effort is simply unreadable. I made several attempts at reading it, but I couldn't get past page 60. Other Fowles enthusiasts I know share this view.	2001-01-09

Books	1	17	67	N	N	Dull, depressing, formulaic and not even funny	I paid Â£1 for this in a sale. I was grossly overcharged. I read less than half of it before giving up.<br />O'Rourke can be amusing for a short time in the same way as a saloon bar loudmouth, but is equally tedious after any prolonged exposure. His formulaic writing style and ill-informed ranting are tiresome in the extreme. I can only assume that his popularity is down to a significant number of people who have similarly small minds and like to read someone who shares their prejudices and never challenges them. <br />Judging from this book, I'd be surprised if Mr O'Rourke ever gains any pleasure from travel. I would guess that he only does it to give himself something to write about - it's his job, after all.	2000-11-05

After reading the excellent &quot;House of Sleep&quot; and &quot;What a Carve Up&quot;, this came as a big disappointment, although with  a few mitigating good features. The basic problem of this book is that its central characters are uninteresting and the plot (such as it is) unabsorbing.  The &quot;short stories within a book&quot; at its core are an interesting idea but somehow never quite work properly.  At some points it threatens to really take off, with some good secondary characters and scenes (particularly between academics and lawyers)and there are some memorable flashes of humour, but overall it is very unsatisying	2000-11-05

Careful plotting and mostly credible characters kept my  interest throughout.<br />It is a deeply Catholic novel, which did't put me  off but, as an atheist, didn't convert me either. The major implausiblility  in the book, for me, was the conversion of a militant athiest by what I  imagine Catholics would call &quot;the divine spirit&quot; or similar.  Sorry, I found this bit laughable. The only other blemish in the book is a  faint whiff of anti-semitism. But still well worth a read.	2000-08-27

To start with, having examples in both Java and C++ makes understanding difficult if you only know one of these langauages. Secondly, as other  reviewers have commented, day 6 is very hard to understand (whereas some  other days, e.g. 1, 5 and 7) are really easy reads.)<br />There are still many  good things about this book. IDL is very well covered, and the format of  each &quot;day&quot; (intro/ text body / summmary / Q &amp; A /  exccercises) is excellent for self-teaching.	2000-05-28

As one who finds the vast majority of travel books uninteresting, I'm pleased to say this is a real exception. Mr Dalrymple writes with style, knowledge and above all passion about the history and plight of the many  Christian communities of the Levant,  but without a hint of religious  bigotry, although he appears to be a practising Catholic. <br />He writes  lucidly, and shows a lot knowledge about history and religion, but never  appears to be showing off his command of language and history (Patrick  Leigh Fermour, please note!). Unlike, say, Paul Theroux, he always comes  accross as the sort of guy you'd like to be travalling with, someone who  has a genuine interest in the people he meets. He has a sense of humour,  too.<br />I have spent some time (although not enough) in several of the  countries he writes of, and can verify some of what he says, but his  knowledge and insight is vastly greater than mine is. If you are travelling  to the Levant, take this book with you, it'll help you understand so much.  <br />If you're not travelling to the Levant, read it anyway, whether you are  religious or not. This should be mandatory reading for religious leaders  and politicians everywhere	2000-05-19

There's a lot of good information in here, but it really isn't all it should be. The quality of the writing is a tad erratic, chapters are padded out with long lists of methods etc which would be better consigned to an  appendix. <br /> It has feel of a book which has been thrown together in a  hurry. Some of the sample programs are poorly documented and difficult to  understand. I'm not sure the writers really knew who their target audience  were; some of the Java text, for example, is very basic but other parts of  it are difficult, but there's not a logical step-by-step progression. The  book is really a bit of a rag-bag.   That said, there's a lot of good stuff  in here, but it's hard work finding it sometimes.	2000-04-12

It is vastly more readible than the competion (e.g. Fowler). and lends itself well to  teaching yourself OO/UML. The exercises and answers at the end of each  chapter are particularly useful in this respect.<br />Be warned - it gets  tougher as it goes along, but that's because the stuff he's putting across  IS tough.<br />All in all, highly recommended.	2000-03-18

There are better alternatives	If you are new to OO and want to learn, this isn't a bad place to start. It is an exceptionally well laid-out book, very useful for reference, and covers the basics of OO in clear language. It is a very useful aid to  demystifying OO jargon. But it does make it all sound too easy and ignores  or understates the practical difficulties of OO development. <br />A major  theme of this book is that OO, used correctly, will create adaptable  systems. (Interestingly, Dr Taylor admits that OO hasn't fulfilled its  early promises of more rapid system development.)  Some superficial  analogies of Objects with cellular organisms are made to this point, but Dr  Taylor offers no hard real-world evidence for his claims.  This is a major  fault with the book as a whole. I  was surprised by someone with a PhD  would make so many assertions with so little hard evidence.<br />One such  assertion is &quot;legacy integration is easy&quot;, proposing the solution  of   &quot;wrapping&quot; to deal with legacy systems. Anyone with  practical experience will know this is hopelessly simplistic. If you have   a million lines of ancient COBOL and you need to change the internal logic  of the newly wrapped &quot;object&quot;, you've still got the same problem  as before. <br />The section on Object Databases is another case in point.  Again, the basics were well communicated but the with little consideration  of their downside, or how successful RDMS's (and more recently hybrid DBs)  have been in recent years.  IT departments will be very reluctant to scrap  RDMS's and replace them with object DBs after spending years getting RDMSs  to work well, and give users query tools they can use effectively. I'd need  a lot of convincing, with hard, objective evidence, before using an Object  DB rather than tried and tested RDMS on an industrial-strength project.  (The author was employed by Gemstone - is his view completely objective?)  <br />The problems, limits and costs of OO development are barelytouched  upon. For a balanced view, I  would strongly recommend reading Alistair  Cockburn's excellent  &quot;Surviving Object-Oriented Projects&quot; as an  antidote to the more fanciful claims made in this book.  Or as an  alternative introduction to OO, plus a lot more, I would recommend Mielir  Page-Jones's &quot;Fundamentals of OO Design Using UML&quot; ahead of Dr.  Taylor's book.	2000-03-18

Unlike most other OO authors I've encountered, Alistair Cockburn is not  interested in selling OO as the answer to all our prayers, but uses a  wealth of case studies to show us the limits,  pitfalls and negative side  of OO development, as well as the benefits. Perhaps because of this, he  doesn't ignore the management aspects of development, most of which are  common to OO and non-OO projects.  The book is also well presented and well  written, and even has a sprinkling of humour. I particularly like his term  &quot;PolyBloodyHardReuse&quot;, the meaning of which will be obvious to  anyone who's ever seen attempts to introduce software reuse into an  organisation.	2000-03-09

It is one of my all-time favourites, repaying multiple readings.<br />It works on several  levels - as a straight thriller (is the narrator really paranoid? is Quinn  insane? what's the truth about Prentice Snr, a mute inmate in a mental  hospital), as a wonderfully vivid decriptive novel (Wimbledon, the London  underground &amp; Eastern France are all brought to life magnificently), a  terrific gallery of characters, a study on family relations, guilt and  expectations ...

The main ideas of  the book (evolutionary delivery, defining ojectives as either  &quot;functional&quot; or &quot;attributes&quot;  ) may not seem  revolutionary, but apply it and it could revolutionise your project and  maybe career. No IT book I've ever has ever affected my own work so  profoundly.<br />It's also well written and exceptionally well laid out. More  please, Tom!	1999-09-19

It contains a lot of good information in an easily digestible fashion.<br />It's a good book to learn about a range of contemporary (ish) issues in IT - software  processes, CASE tools, QA, metrics reuse etc etc. Short chapters and  Yourdon's chatty style help greatly. The chapter on recommended reading has  some great pointers too.<br />The negatives are that it's pretty superficial  at times and reads very much like a consultant / salesman selling his wares  rather than someone who actually runs projects for a living. In particular,  the chapter on software methodologies seemed very simplistic to me (and I  have had experience of many, believe me!)<br />Still, all in all I'd recommend  this to any IT profesional who feels he/she is only exposed to  a narrow  range of software tools &amp; methods and wants to know more about what  else is out there.	1999-08-16

It's often very funny, especially about some of the poe-faced extremes of feminism, and I suspect deliberately a bit ambiguous - was Lorin Jones a great talent  overlooked by the world or just another wannabee artist of no special  talent? Or is such a judgement entirely subjective? Alison Lurie is  sometimes described as a &quot;feminist author&quot;;  if there is a  message for women in this book, it seems to be something along the lines  of: don't let men run your life, but don't let dogma run it either.	1999-07-13

The psychology of the husband, Brian Tate, is thoroughly and sympathetically  examined - he looks like a success, but his own self-view is very  different. This, and the great feeling of the palce and period (1969) are  the strengths of this novel.<br />Its weaknesses are that it gets less  convincing towards the end, and the author's rather simplistic femanism  gets the better of her, particularly when pontificating on male  relationships. <br />Overall, not one of her best, but still a good read.	1999-07-13
