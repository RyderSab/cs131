As an African-American I found this episode of the Miss Julia adventures offensive. The African-American housekeeper Lillian and her neighbors were portrayed as too ignorant to believe. If I had not received this book free of charge, I would have asked for my money back. Never again will I read a Miss Julia book.	2003-04-29

I felt that the author made the female characters in the novel nothing but ...air heads. She made no effort to prove that a woman does not need a man to complete her as a person. I am just very disappointed that a sistah feels so lowly of her own kind.	2002-04-06

Also that he would leave a good black woman the moment a white woman gives him  glance. After reading this novel, I know that I would never read or purchase anything else by this author. I am very disappointed in this book as well as for this person being of African-American origin.	2002-04-06
