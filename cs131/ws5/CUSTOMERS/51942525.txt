Hissy Fit is the book that has convinced me to strike Andrews from my reading list.<br /><br />Briefly, it's the story of interior designer Keeley Murdock, who throws a 'hissy fit' when she finds her fiancee and her maid of honor doing the deed at the country club rehearsal dinner.<br /><br />This seems to be a book that tries to capitalize on the current interest in decorating and shopping that fuels HGTV.  It's page after page of descriptions of furniture, rooms, shoes, clothes, food....I love all that....but this is more than even a dedicated shopper, gourmet, home decorator can take.<br /><br />My suggestion?  Find yourself a chocolate cupcake and a glass of milk, and just go on and turn on HGTV.	2005-06-12

The six historical novels are set in sixteenth century Scotland and Europe and tell the story of Francis Crawford, Master of Lymond, a Scot who is caught up in the battle for control of Scotland.<br /><br />The Game of Kings, the first in the series, is set in 1547 Scotland:  The English have successfully invaded Scotland, five-year-old Mary sits on a precarious throne, and Francis Crawford stands accused of treason.<br /><br />At this point I no longer am sure what to say about Dunnett's book.  I, personally, loved it and have ordered the remaining five books in the series.  However, getting through the first hundred or so pages was an act of faith.  I've spent the past few years reading a lot of easy, read-while-watching-TV books.  This is not one of those.  Dunnett's style demands complete concentration and attention.<br /><br />Francis Crawford is a wonderful, charasmatic character.  He's been compared to Byron, Lawrence of Arabia, James Bond, and Lord Peter Wimsey. The historical accuracy, wit, suspense, invention, and sheer excitement in Dunnett's books are undisputable.<br /><br />Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles are the yardstick by which other historical novels are measured.  They are a great treasure, but they are not for the faint of heart.	2005-06-05

Olly grieves, coping with the warmth and awkwardness of family ties and tries to re-establish her own life.<br /><br />Olly comes to realize that her own risks are just as daring as Sam's - he risked his life and she is willing to risk her heart -and she again finds herself and love - but in a surprising place.<br /><br />This is a flawed book.  It falls into two uneven parts that I had a great deal of difficulty with.  On the other hand, it was refreshingly different and the characters were interesting.

The first half of the book recounts Natalie's comic attempts to visit the inn, her real but limited success, and the interesting people she encounters along the way.<br /><br />The second half of the book concerns the twenty-five-year-old Natalie's re-introduction to the inn and her romance with the innkeepers' son.<br /><br />As always, Lipman's characters are quirky, yet true to life.

Anya Seton's Katherine is a historical novel based on the real life fourteenth century love story of John of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford.<br /><br />John was at times the most powerful man in England:  Duke of Lancaster through his marriage to Blanche, its duchess; fourth son of the King Henry; King of Castile through a later marriage to its queen; and later uncle to King Richard. He was the father of King Henry IV of England.<br /><br />Katherine was a commoner, the wife of one of John's knights, and with John became the ancestor of the English Tudor line.<br /><br />They met when Katherine was a young woman, had a torrid love affair, and remained in love throughout their lives.  This was extraorindary for the time in which they lived.<br /><br />This is a long dense book [500 pages in tiny print]that gives an excellent picture of the period.  Seton wrote during the 1950's and the book reflects that - you'll find no passionate love scenes here, yet the passion of John and Katherine's affair is the motivating force of the book.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in the medieval period.	2005-03-17

Marsha Moyer's The Second Coming of Lucy Hatch is a 'keeper.'<br /><br />Lucy is unexpectedly a widow.  Her rancher husband Mitchell walks out into a field one morning and never comes back.  And with his death Lucy comes to realize that during her fourteen-year-marriage to Mitchell she herself was slowly dying.  So a rather numb Lucy moves home to Mooney, Texas, and the care of her born-again mother, her free-thinking Aunt Dove, and her over-protective brother and sister-in-law.  Add to this mix the local handyman, Ash Farrell - guitar-playing, sex symbol, unconventional, and strongly attracted to Lucy.<br /><br />This is a wonderful multi-level book.  It's both a romance - Lucy and Ash are HOT - and a coming of age book.  Lucy is forced to look to her past in order to create a future.  I loved every page - from the low down Texas dive where Ash sings and is beaten up by a former girl friend to Mitchell's lonely tombstone engraved with only his name and dates.<br /><br />The Second Coming of Luch Hatch gets an A from me.	2005-03-17

For Kate Hamilton, the trouble with Valentine's Day is that she's thirty-three and single and just been dumped by her boyfriend.  Her confidence is at an all-time low, so she decides to hit on a hunk in a bar.  Not a smart move.<br /><br />This is a funny romantic comedy set in Gospel, Idaho, the setting of one of Rachel Gibson's earlier books.  A few of the earlier characters make an appearance, but it's basically the story of Kate, who has returned to Gospel to help her widowed grandfather with his small grocery store.  Kate has had one 'run-in' with former hockey player Rob Sutter [who, as you have guessed, shot her down on Valentine's].  Turns out Rob owns the sporting goods store across the square from her grandfather's store.  Plus her grandfather and his mother begin dating.<br /><br />I found this to be a fun story, and it certainly has its steamy side.  I have read a few negative comments about Rob - he's imperfect.  He hasn't always handled his life well.  He's made Mistakes.  And he's hirsute.<br /><br />All I can say is that I had a great visit to Gospel, Idaho.	2005-03-17

Yet I know that Barbara Samuel has written much better books.<br /><br />It's one of those multiple character books that one feels is aimed at multiple markets - not a good feeling.<br /><br />The major character is Trudy, who at 46 discovers that her husband Rick is having an affair.  Trudy takes a tire iron and breaks the windows in his truck [way to go, girl], kicks him out, then realizes that she does really love him.  For Trudy most of the novel's action involves looking back on the choices that she didn't make and try to decide where she should go from here.  I did find Trudy and Rick's story to be riveting - he done her wrong, they both know it, but now what?<br /><br />There's Jade, a beautiful bi-racial social worker whose ex-husband is doing time, and who has come to Kitchen Avenue to care for her recently widowed grandmother.  Jade's ambition is to be a boxer. [yep, she wants to be r-e-a-l-l-y strong]<br /><br />Jade's grandmother, Roberta, has just lost her greatly loved husband of sixty-two years.  She's faced with the decision of just how hard she's willing to fight to go on with her life.<br /><br />For me the least interesting character was Shannelle [her mom thought she was naming her after the perfume.]  Shannelle is an aspiring writer. She's from a rather trashy background, married to a dependable blue collar hispanic guy, and requires constant encouragement to 'follow her dream.'<br /><br />I liked Trudy, Rick, and their kids enough to read this one again.

I'm not sure what makes it 'chick lit,' but I am sure that it's a fine fine book.  It's also the sequel to Moyer's first novel, The Second Coming of Lucy Hatch, and I strongly suggest reading that one first.<br /><br />Lucy Hatch is a strong, sexy, earthy novel about two people finding each other despite, or, perhaps, because of their pasts.<br /><br />Honkey-tonk Angel is the story of what happens when Lucy wakes up one morning with sexy Ash and realizes that life must go on.<br /><br />Moyer introduces Denny, Ash's fourteen-year-old daughter, who comes to spend the summer with Ash and Lucy.  And Denny becomes a strong voice in the novel.  This is not a romance.  It is a novel about relationships, and the ties of family and the past, and love, and growing up [whether you're fourteen or thirty-three], and accepting responsibility....<br /><br />Once again Moyer's characters are full, well-rounded, quirky, wonderful; East Texas has never been more interesting, and the tension between love and sex never more successfully explored.<br /><br />Can I give this one a 6 out 5?	2004-03-10

The reviews that I read at Amazon pretty much said that it's okay but not as good as Savannah.  And that pretty much hits it.<br /><br />Lies is the story of Mary Bliss McGowan, an Atlanta yuppie who doesn't realise that her marriage is in trouble until the night she finds a note from her husband telling her that he's gone - with all their joint assets. Mary Bliss responds by telling one 'little bitty lie' - that he's just out of town.  The one little lie escalates until she and her best friend end up faking his death to collect the insurance.<br /><br />Andrews [who is really Atlanta author Kathy Trocheck] does a great job catching the Atlanta/Southern ambience, but it's hard to see Mary Bliss as a sympathetic character when she lies to her daughter and mother-in-law about her husband's death and when her major concern with the end of her marriage is financial.<br /><br />I'm giving this one a C and hope that Ms Andrews will slow down and do better preparation before she writes her next one.	2004-02-23

Shall I mention that it's probably the best romance novel that I've read in the past year?  possibly ever?  It is.  But I doubt that it would appeal to everyone.<br /><br />The plot [in 25 words or less]:  Sylvie, a lady with a checkered past, is hired by an enemy of Robert Dovenby to uncover his well-guarded past.  She does this by posing as his male secretary. [granted, that was 28 words]<br /><br />This is possibly the most erotic, sensual book that I have ever read.  It is set in the eighteenth century and the characters remain consistent with their time period.  They are jaded, cynical, secretive and fascinating as layer by layer we learn who they are.  Dove and Sylvie are strongly attracted to each other from first sight and the first two hundred pages of the book becomes an elaborate exercise in foreplay.  Every aspect of their lives takes on a sensual aspect.  Remember those first weeks of falling in love? The mixture of lust and sensuality?  Ross captures that.  Everything from the clothes that touch their bodies and to the foods they eat carries a sensual note.<br /><br />It is also a well-written, sometimes lyric, story with a strong plot and interesting supporting characters.	2004-02-11

This is a mistake, since Emma is then forced to resort to a con to get her compensation, and the chase is on.<br />Emma and Stuart have a delightful chemistry; at times kinky and at times thoughtful, they are forced to deal with immediate physical attraction and a more slowly developing love.  Neither is a conventional stock romantic lead: Emma is a woman with a past and Stuart deals daily with a stutter.  Ivory very ably catches the nuances of an adult stutter who copes successfully with his problem, hiding it in shifts in rhythm and phrasing.  Neither character completely trusts the other nor wants to open themselves to love.<br />Watchting Emma and Stuart together is just plain fun.  And I will never view chairs in quite the same light.<br />This book not only makes my keeper shelf [used bookstore eat your heart out], I have made it my #1 book in my Top 10 List.  What more can I say?	2002-11-12

This a beauty and the beast story without much plot or action and absolutely no characterization.  On the other hand, once the sex scenes start, they're lusty and frequent, but unforunately not very original.<br />Probably the most irritating aspect of the book is Feehan's use of italicized Italian words.  signora, famiglia, palazzo, aristocratizla, cara....If we are to assume that the characters are speaking Italian, why then would some of their words be in Italian and most in English?  Endearments would be one thing, but if I have to read the words 'mio fratelleo' one more time I am going to growl.<br />I gave it one star because I had to force myself to finish it.  And had it been a library book, I would have just taken it back.<br />I enjoy fantasy plots, but the requisite word here is PLOT, something LAIR OF THE LION lacks.<br />I used to look forward to Christine Feehan's books.  But this is my last one.	2002-09-09

Friends who  have read the original smaller version liked it; no one I've talked to has liked this version.<br />The characters are typical Evanovich and delightful; the plot seems to be going along nicely, and then the padding begins.  Plot is going in all directions and the charm of the Evanovich books is no where in sight.<br />I bought this book after reading the first four or so chapters; they were a delight.  Then the book got boring; I started skipping paragraphs, then pages, then raced on to the improbable ending.<br />My advice: save your money for the new Plum.  Don't go here.	2002-09-03

I found it entertaining and enjoyable; I liked both the major characters and had no trouble following the plot line.  That said, the characters are static and the plot is superficial.  HOWEVER, the dialogue and tension between the major characters is delightful - reminiscent of Hepburn and Tracy.  So whether or not you like it, will depend on what you're looking for.  It's a light, entertaining read - but not well crafted.	2002-08-11

I suppose my major reservation about STONEBROOK COTTAGE is that it's best read after the others in this New England-Texas series; it would stand as a good story on its own, but as usual there are all these characters hanging around from earlier books.<br />I enjoyed the characters - the children rang true, and it's always fun to 'catch up' on characters from earlier books.  The secondary love story between the new governor and a local farmer has a nice, different twist.  The hero was very much the alpha male of women's popular fiction intent on getting his own way, but since Neggers counters this with an equally strong heroine equally intent on getting her own way, it works.<br />It's light summer reading; not the best book I've read this summer, but far from the worst.

I usually like Anne Stuart's books, but there are a few major inconsistencies in STILL LAKE that strongly detract from the conclusion.  The story line hinges on one of the characters behaving in a way that is highly unlikely and to put is plainly -stupid.  There is also doubt that the villain would be able to behave in the manner described.  I won't go into further detail for fear of spoiling the book for others.  Despite all this, there is nothing special about STILL LAKE.  There is little that is original or remarkable.  As far as suspense, I had no trouble whatever putting it down and was never caught up in the suspense.<br />Anne Stuart has done much better in the past.	2002-07-31

It was offputting to hear early nineteenth century characters using modern slang.  And the plot is improbable to the point of unbelievability.  Plus, the major characters aren't even likeable.  That said, Hingston shows promise; her writing style is in many ways excellent for a romantic author, she just needs to put more work into her books and TO BE BETTER EDITED!	2002-07-21

The three major protagonists are likeable and although wealthier than the average reader will be, easy to identify with.  That said, the solutions to their problems are all too superficial.  For example,we have one more over-weight woman losing weight and turning her life around. But my major disappointments are two: there are far too many pages that are just plain dull and unnecessary to plot or character development [filler?] that I just skipped after a while.  And the major change in Kip's life seems contrived [I won't say more to avoid ruining the book for someone else].

I too felt that I had aged while reading the book, but hopefully not that much.

Yes, I've read all the other Cynster books and if this had been the first one that I'd read, it would be the only one.  Basically, the plot comes down to Amanda setting out to \\"capture\\" a male similar to her Cynster cousins; once he's interested, then to keep the story going, he must yield and tell her that he loves her.  There's also a minor mystery element that is all too easily solved.  Laurens keeps the book going through Amanda's trysts with the AlphaMale.  Sounds good in theory, but in fact, the \\"sex\\" scenes are boring.  While reading the first, big, \\"she looses her viginity\\" scene, I found myself wondering what to put on my grocery list. not good.  I'll admit that I will peak into Amelia's story, but it will be while standing up in the bookstore.  I've asked myself why this story doesn't work and all I can think of is the heroine is NOT engaging, there is little chemistry between the major characters, and I got tired of reading about them having sex in public - repetition takes away the edge.	2002-04-07

Most authors would kill to write a book this good.	2001-10-17

She could have done so much more with this.<br />That said, it's worth reading.	2001-10-13

That happens here.  Great characters, good plot, then - we keep getting sermons and history lessons.  I agree with the author's views on the Irish situation, but I was looking for entertainment, not a seminar.	2001-10-11

This is not a &quot;get away from reality&quot; book.  Themes include sexual harrassment, gang rape, Alzeheimer's, child molestation, Jewish-Gentile lovers caught in World War II.  This is perhaps too much to carry in one book.  Add to that at least one tragic romance and one that the reader expected to be resolved and was not.  If Brockmann wants to write a really good novel and not a romance, she needs to change forums and go with it.  This attempt to combine forms just doesn't work.  The Sam-Alyssa romance has become a soap.	2001-09-07

One has an appealing hero and heroine with an intriguing &quot;problem.&quot;  At the same time, we had page upon page of turgid prose describing the political situation in Khasmir and lots of pages that must have been written from someone's notes.  I liked the major characters; I skipped the many boring parts.  Now I'm taking my copy of the book to a second hand bookstore. It's not a keeper.	2001-09-07

Did you ever get the feeling that an author was killing time?  Howard does in Open Season.  I agree with the reviewers who said that this should have been a paperback.  I want to like Linda Howard's books, but I will never again buy one of her hardbound books without looking it over very carefully first.	2001-08-14

Which is fine, if you're in the mood for repetetive sex, but not fine if you're in the mood for plot? Kleypas can and has done better.  There is little character development and the plot goes nowhere.	2001-06-17

I agree that the subplot with Lys and Sam is interesting and it's a relief to see romantic fiction finally reflect life with a bi-racial couple.  I especially liked the World War II love affair that mirrored the main plot. It was an enjoyable read and I too await the next installment.	2001-03-09

While it may not be perfect (sometimes the historical perspective just doesn't ring true), this is a fun read and proves that Robards is at the top of her form.

A WOMAN OF VIRTUE is one of the best romance novels that I've read in the last year, and Carlyle's other novels rank among those best. Unlike many romance writers, Carlyle has a mature writing style as well as well as well-developed characters and plots.  All the necessary romance elements - chemical attraction between two well-drawn protagonists, a simple, but fast-moving plot, and a story line connected to previous novels - are here.  Her major characters are likeable; her sex scenes are sensual.  Hey, I'd give her six stars if I could!	2001-03-05

This one is not up to her usual standard [yes, it's far better than many romance novels, but not as good as I've come to expect from her.]  There's a lack of passion between the protagonists and the plot is too predictable.  Neither of the main characters came alive for me.  This said, I'll still buy her next book!	2001-02-10

Linda Howard has advanced from the pure romance category to the mystery-suspense category with great sex thrown in.  I'm not complaining.  We have a great alpha type hero AND a heroine who can take care of herself.  She's resourceful, competent, logical, and she manages to take of him.  Ms. Howard must have great fantasies and thanks to her, I am too.	1999-08-03
