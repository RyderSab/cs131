US	40368789	RO3XMZWFL3MJP	0312333382	899659165	Fantastic: The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Interesting subject, fairly assessed	Mr. Leamer had a tremendously difficult task, writing a biography about a subject who reached the pinnacle in three different functional areas whose personal life has been on display for 30+ years.<br /><br />Mr. Leamer is able to provide considerable perspective in each discipline with the exception of Arnold's business dealings.  Having a brother who is a nationally recognized economist appeared to really help bring a fair and compelling perspective of Arnold's politics that is rarely found in the newspapers that cover CA politics.  Leamer is also able to get Arnold's closest associates on the record, making this body of work argubly the definitive biography of Arnold that mayever be written for the period of his life that is covered.<br /><br />Besides being unbiased, I was also impressed with Leamer's writing skills, the book is highly readable without sinking to innuendo and massive amounts of anonymous quotes a la' Kitty Kelly.<br /><br />While Arnold is quite the character, making it easy in terms of having lots entertaining content to cover, the fact he is visible makes for a challenge to divulge fresh unknown material.  I believe Leamer best excels in presenting the nature of Arnold's personality, in fact he does an excellent job of helping us to understand how a gregarious guy like Arnold that loves people could also be so crude and demeaning to not just his foes, but those around him.<br /><br />Because Arnold is such a likable personality and has excelled in five areas (sports, business, acting, and politics); Leamer's Arnold is presented in a mostly positive light - I would assume that Arnold and his family would be happy with this product.  I do think however that the book is fair and when it presents stories that elevate or detract from his reputation; I believe Leamer presents these stories in the proper context.<br /><br />I also recommend this book to anyone who is ambitous; Arnold's life is a classic case study on how to succeed, he's earned his station in life, and Leamer explains how.  What's fun for us is it appears that Arnold's climb to success was a \\"fantastically\\" joyous ride.s earned his station in life, and Leamer explains how.

If you listened to Arnold S.'s speech at the 2004 Republican Convention you would have heard Arnold stating classic republican values held by Jefferson, Madison, Lincoln, and Eisenhower; you would have then wondered how you could vote for GOP nominees in 2004 since they were directly oppossed to these values, having been driven by far right influences in the party to a promotion of conservative majoritarian democractic policies - the antithesis of the values our founding Republicans desired when they created our democratic republic and in direct violation of the 9th, 10th, 14th amendments and Article IV of the main body of the Constitution.<br /><br />Ms. Whitman is the epitomy of a politican sharing the values stated by Arnold's speech.  Whitman promotes laissez faire in not just economic matters, but also social matters.  Yet one would be hard pressed to find a true Republican on the national stage today with federal responsibilities.  Thus, Ms. Whitman takes a stand for the party to return not just to its roots, but to uphold republican ideals that are also our founding ideals.<br /><br />While Whitman does a near excellent job of showing how far the GOP has mutated away from Republican and American values, her book needs a second half, what to do about it and how to present itself to the public in terms of solutions to real problems.<br /><br />The book reads like a toe dipping into the water of a possible run for the presidency in 2008; it even promotes a website, (...).  Comparing her book to Newt Ginrich's book, another presidential hopeful writing a book to potentially bolster his ambitions, Whitman's book is shown to be sorely lacking in solutions relative to Gingrich's book, which is full of proposals.<br /><br />Gingrich, a dangerous political opportunist willing to sell out American ideals in his quest for power, at least is willing to put a stake in the ground on what Republicans should do.  Whitman on the other hand provides one short chapter summing up that since conservative republicans are so bad, we should vote for moderate republicans, without really making a case on what priorities and policy positions moederates should focus on.<br /><br />Thus, while I love Whitman's record and her accomplishments in NJ, and love her critique of the far right in this book, I find the book lacking in policy solutions.<br /><br />As an aside, Whitman implies Gingrich is a moderate, this was the only serious lapse in judgement I found in this book, but what a whopper!!!<br /><br />After reading this book, especially if you are a moderate yearning for an amendment to let Arnold run, one could easily see Whitman being up to the task as a President Arnold clone - not a bad position in my humble opinion.republicans are so bad, we should vote for moderate republicans, without really making a case on what priorities and policy positions moederates should focus on.

His short analyses though are spot-on.<br /><br />Mr. Church's book presents, in their own words, essays and letters from:  Patrick Henry (an enemy of religious freedom and some of our founding ideals), Sam Adams, George Mason, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and others.  It also includes the Treaty of Tripoli initiated by Washington's administration but ratified by Adams after being unanimously ratified by the 5th Congress which expressly defines the U.S. as \\"not being in any sense founded on the Christian religion\\".  The preponderance of evidence collected in this book strongly favors the fact that our framers (not neccesarily our founders like Henry), were enlightened gentleman suspicious of organized religion, but respectful of humanaity's need for faith, and that a relationship between religion and government led to corruption of religion and the derprivation of freedom to citizens and thus the need to separate the two institutions as much as possible.<br /><br />Being an avid student on this topic, I can state unequivocably that Mr. Church's assessment is accurate relative to the framers' historic desire to secularize government.  Mr. Church even presents Madison's post-Presidential memorandum on his admitted hypocrisy regarding his re-establishing national days of prayer during the build-up to the War of 1812 and the fear that elicited.<br /><br />The book is light in available source material regarding the majority of our leading framer's express desire to seperate church and state in hopes that religion would evolve to a faith in line with scientific fact that believed in a God of universal grace rather than the God described by fundamentalist Christians (then called Trinitarians) and that disestablishing religion was considered necessary in order that Citizens had the \\"freedom of conscience\\" to evolve to a more unitarian, if not deistic, faith already shared by our enlightened founders.  It is surprising Mr. Church doesn't explore this more fully given that he is a long-time Unitarian Minister with a Ph.D. in Early Church history and editor of \\"Thomas Jefferson's Bible\\", suggesting he's completely up to the task.<br /><br />This is an excellent book to own and I highly recommend it because of its wealth of source data, all in a tiny book, 157 pages in a small footprint.  It however is assuredly NOT the definitive book on the relationship between church and state due to its limited scope and incompleteness of source material (.e.g, it's missing Madison vetoing faith-based charities as President along with the failed efforts to extend constitutional power to the gov't through a particular sect's version of God v. gov't deriving power directly from \\"We the People\\"), however since I haven't found that perfect book on this subject, one can't be too critical of Mr. Church.<br /><br />For those of you that have been duped into believing the Dobson/Moore/Robertson propaganda that our government was divinely established to Christianize the world based on fundamentlist beliefs, I would recommend this book as well.  The framers quoted here belong to all of us, possessing their words, with very little editorializing by Mr. Church makes this book a very un-controversial book that will hopefully enlighten you and motivate you to further research the veracity of today's religious right propagandists v. what legitimate scholars and historians publish.<br /><br />While reading this book I suggest thinking about the electability of some of America's greatest generation of statesmen:  the words of Madison, Jefferson, Adams, and Washington would make them certainly UNELECTABLE in today's world  where politicans are forced to kneel down to the dogma of belief in a theistic, vengeful God as defined by a primitive sect of Christians to even have a chance of getting past the primaries.  While a deistic Jefferson and Madison or unitarian Adams could be elected then and were able to establish our precious American ideals, these men wouldn't stand a chance today, our loss in my humble opinion.he dogma of belief in a theistic, vengeful God as defined by a primitive sect of Christians to even have a chance of getting past the primaries.

My quibble is how thin this volume is, quite frankly I was hoping for more perspective.

On the contrary, I would propose that Chief Justice Rehnquist is a wonderful writer who provides a short masterpiece on the history of the Court.<br /><br />Two perspectives on the history of the Court create the primary structure of the book:<br /><br />1)  Rehnquist reviews specific cases in chronological order that have created the most imporant body of law used by the Supreme Court and required to be followed by the lower courts as they conduct their appellate work.  He weaves in the personalities of the Court and sometimes of the Presidents who impact the Court, along with the historical perspective driving these issues by using a narrative structure.  We are told stories rather than being forced to review lists of dates and people.  This portion of the book also describes how the Court accepts cases through the eyes of a young  court clerk, William Rehnquist himself.<br /><br />2)  There are a couple of chapters in the back of the book that explains how the court conducts its work, such as oral argument and how the court decides cases and delegates the writing of rulings and opinions.  While interesting to read Rehnquist's perspecive, Bob Woodward's \\"The Brethern:  Inside the Supreme Court\\" provides a more complete picture of the inner-workings of the Court.<br /><br />Justice Rehnquist surprised me with the lack of ideology contained in this book.  As opposed to Mr. Gingrich's new book that is basically a propaganda tract rife with deceptions, Rehnquist provides a mostly honest and fair assessment of not only the perspective of conservatives like him, but also the liberal side.  Rehnquist, like Kenneth Starr's \\"First Among Equals\\", can be counted on to provide an accurate protrayal of the issues worked out by previous courts.<br /><br />Mr. Rehnquist also surprised me with his writing talent, while his opinions have always been first rate reading, they are those of an advocate for a certain position which filter-out competing positions.  This book is truly a well-written, honest look at the history of the court; Rehnquist provides respectful commentary of  competing positions.

Tocqueville's essays on the dangers of a pure democracy and how Americans relate to their government is as relevant today as it was in the 1800s. Tocqueveille brings forward a broad range of themes, his essays on these themes provide evidence he was an uncanny journalist and poltical analyst, a rare trait in one person.  Its amazing that one person could learn so much in one 9 month trip!<br /><br />The reader not only gets an unmatched history lesson on the effects our founding had on America circa-Jacksonian times, his his genius analysis of that history provides perspective on the strengths of having a democratic republic where liberty reigns rather a pure democracy mutating into tyranny that are just as true today.<br /><br />As for editions, I much prefer the Folio Society publication because its easier to quickly find releveant subject matter and the quality of binding materials meets the standard of excellence of the author.

US	40368789	R3PEPGV676R4CH	0143034758	686377339	Alexander Hamilton	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Why we are a Democratic REPUBLIC and not just a Democracy	Several reasons why all students of our founding should read this book:<br /><br />1) Hamilton is probably the most influential American who didn't become President, with the only possible exception being Chief Justice John Marshall.  In fact, very few Presidents had more influence on the future of our country.  By the age of 40 when Hamilton leaves Philadelphia after vacating the post of Secretary of the Treasury, Hamilton almost single-handedly had according to Chernow in page 481 and I paraphrase, \\"created a finance system moving America from bankruptcy to solvency and credit equal to any European nation, laid the groundwork for liberal democracy and capitalism, transformed the President from passive administrator to active policy maker, and helped the Federalists to weld the states into one nation.\\"<br /><br />2) While Chernow tells his tale chronologically, each chapter focuses on a major theme, like Hamilton's role as writer and editor of The Federalist, while several other major themes run through a string of chapters, such as the ideological battle between the progressive Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson's position (before becoming President); where Jefferson pushed for limited federal powers and a passive federal bureaucracy.  Chernow's skill as a writer allows the interested reader to establish a high retention rate on notable events involving Hamiliton relative to pedestrian biographies.  More biographers should follow this lead in structuring their work.<br /><br />3)  Hamilton wasn't just a major influence on American politics and our founding in one or two realms, but was such an energetic civil servant, he had major impacts on more areas than any other founding father:  active participant in drafting our Constitution, intellectual resource to assure ratification of the Constitution, chief architect of the resulting framework of government to execute government under our constitution, founder of American capitalism, founder of our financial framework, major influence on New York City becoming a major financial capital, among others.<br /><br />4) To influence what we want out of public servants.  While Chernow clearly shows how weak Hamilton's political skills were, his functional genius in so many areas, coupled with his energy and focus, provide evidence of what we could achieve if we elected, and expected political appointees, to perform at extremely high levels of competency (examples of modern-day Hamilton's: Alan Greenspan, Bob Rubin as Treasury Secretary for Clinton) rather than politicians who are clearly incapable of serving (e.g., John Ashcroft and Janet Reno).  Hamilton would have difficulty today getting elected or appointed by Congress given his \\"weaknesses\\" like bluntness, stridency, and personal failures (adultery).<br /><br />My only fault with this book is its indexing.  These sorts of books should also index by subject matter, e.g., index his views on government financing, separation of powers, taxation, family life, etc.  Ketcham's \\"James Madison\\" is an excellent example of how to index a biography.<br /><br />To gauge Chernow's accomplishment, I believe the vast majority of people who read this book will only remember many of the topics wrote bout, but also be extremely confident that Chernow was able to allow us to really know the man Alexander Hamilton.  Compare this to a biographer who had unprecedented access to a serving President, Edmund Morris as Ronald Reagan's biographer.  Morris who was so unsuccessful at describing RR while writing his drafts, that he invents a fictional character and installs him into the story, causing one to not only get no closer to learning who RR really was, but actually increasing the reader's confusion in terms of rentention and understanding.  While Chernow's subject lived 200+ years ago, little doubt remains that the Hamilton of history is accurately reflected in Chernow's biography - BRAVO to Mr. Chernow.k City becoming a major financial capital, among others.      4) To influence what we want out of public servants.

Though those principles weren't perfectly executed at our founding, just like \\"privileges and immunities\\" rights weren't protected beyond propertied white men upon ratification of the Constitution either; we aspire to the principle; execution in an environment of prejudice is always challenging. I read the book because I wanted to understand how well Mr. Whitten communicated with the religious right so intent on revising history and pushing to mutate our government into a form of theocratic fascism and whether he provided an adequate argument to cause those that really care for our country to reconsider their attempts to extend the government power and reduce our religious freedom.<br /><br />First off, while the title of the book is provocative, it will most likely immediately alienate his target audience.  I doubt most evangelicals and fundamentalists define \\"myth\\" the way a historian or scholar would, instead believing it to mean \\"lie\\".  Since most people seek out books to re-affirm their beliefs rather than challenge those beliefs, the title alone will significantly reduce the number of people who will buy and read Whitten's book that are a member of Whitten's target audience.<br /><br />The book is structured into 9 distinct essays, some of which I will expound on:<br /><br />Religious Liberty for Thee, But Not for Me?<br />Whitten make the case that religious liberty can only be assured if the government is unable to endorse a particular religion.  A short well-written argument that is self-evident to any rational person; Whitten also expounds the point that it is irrelevant to the leaders of today's religious right since its not religious freedom they want, they already have that, it is the desire to use the power of the government to transform their dogma into law depriving Americans of some of their freedoms.<br /><br />The Facts of Church-State Separation<br />While Whitten provides some evidence that our founders' objective was to create a wall, he depends too much on subsequent Supreme Court rulings rather than source material from our founders themselves.  I would have added the text within the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli since it was formal U.S. policy signed by President Adams and unanimously ratified by Congress, which stated:  \\"As the government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen [Muslims] ... it is declared ... that no pretext arising from religious opinion shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries....<br />  \\"The United States is not a Christian nation any more than it is a Jewish or a Mohammedan nation.\\"<br /><br />I would have also added numerous policy decisions by early Presidents reinforcing our secular government, along with providing information regarding the enemies of the framing of our Constitution, like Patrick Henry mentioned in a previous reader's review.<br /><br />I believe this chapter also needed a discussion on the difference between the framers' verbal comments regarding their support of religion in Americans' lives and why their policy decisions (like the Tripoli Treaty or Madison's veto of government funding of faith-based charities) came down squarely on reinforcing an institutional separation between church and state.  Recently Justice Scalia dissented in a 10C case (McLeary v. KY) where Scalia ignored founding policy and used verbal rhetoric providing evidence that our framers had faith; as if that somehow equated to their intent to institutionalize their faith by extending government power to endorse a particular sect.<br /><br />The chapter where Mr. Whitten really shines is in the chapter commenting on the relationship between the two 1st amendment religion clauses and whether the original intent was to have equilibrium or whether one clause should be interpreted more broadly than the other term.  I learned quite a bit from Mr. Whitten's analysis and believe this was the best commentary on this subject I've ever read.  Mr. Whitten appears not to favor either of the three arguments, instead providing a fair analysis of all three and thus pushing me into a new area of interest.  This would be an excellent topic for a new book by Mr. Whitten.<br /><br />In the year 2005, the propagandists have been provided an even larger forum to distort our true legacy without rebuke; books like these are needed more now than ever before.  I'd love to see Mr. Whitten republish this book, only with a new title and more evidence of the radical tact our framers took in creating a government of \\"We the People\\" with a government unable to govern our spiritual life or create 2nd class citizens of those that don't subscribe to the majoritarian sect or faction.<br /><br />Regarding a below review by Mr. Tooley; his review states, \\"America was not founded by religionist but by Christians. It was not founded upon religions but upon the gospel of Jesus Christ\\" Patrick Henry\\"<br /><br />While Patrick Henry helped America greatly to revolt against King George III, Henry did NOT advocate ratification of our Constitution partially based on its inherent secularism.  Not only did Henry decide not to attend the Philadelphia Convention though he was invited, additionally he actively lobbied his state of Virginia NOT to ratify the Constitution.  Previous efforts by Henry to establish the Christian religion in Virginia also failed, James Madison led an effort (culminiating in Madison's \\"Memorial and Remonstrance\\" essay) where Virginia's General Assy overwhelmingly defeated Henry's bill to establish Christianity as the State Religion and one year later, 1786, guaranteed Virginia's citizens religious freedom by a vote of 67 to 20.<br /><br />So while Mr. Tooley's quote may be correct, I didn't verify it, it is certainly true that Mr. Tooley is quoting someone who is assurdely NOT a framer of the Constitution, the highest law of the land and the document which dictates the structure of our secular government whereby Americans claim certain rights and deprives the government of certain powers - like establishment of religion.information regarding the enemies of the framing of our Constitution, like Patrick Henry mentioned in a previous reader's review.

Given what we know and do not know regarding our universe and our natural history, how are we to know God and respond when encountering a truer understanding of God?  Spong also asks,and answers, the question, \\"Can Jesus help us to know the nature of the actual Creator?\\"<br /><br />Spong's response is to work at knowing God on His terms, not filtered through oft-times inaccurate dogma from 2000 years ago.  Spong suggests we study the words of Jesus that were common to other wise men that  are consistent with a God capable of creating such a wonderful, but unyielding world.  To know God isn't to merely shuffle the routine of reading bible verses, God is everywhere and inspires us from all different perspectives, including much of what Jesus said.<br /><br />His chapter on knowing Christ as a way to better know God correlate with Jesus' statements regarding our place in the  Kingdom of God in the here and now.  This perspective provides a much different perspective on how to act now, rather than how to act for a Kingdom yet to come.  In the context of a Kingdom here and now, the words of Jesus shine through while some canonical writings defining a God of wrath and jealousy dwindle to nothing.  Universal grace and love attain primary focus, and intolerance and bigotry are exposed to the light of day in all their ugliness.<br /><br />Spong uses higher criticism to shed light on a God that tells us to honor the least among us, to turn the other cheek, to care for our widows and children - a God of amazing grace, who recommends we too live grace-filled lives; not a God used by evil-doers like Joshua to justify mass murder against the \\"other\\".<br /><br />Spong's description of God demands a response from us filled with grace and love, and thus a rejection of the religious right proseltyzing for political power to perpetuate hatred and bigotry towards today's versions of the \\"other\\".<br /><br />Spong's book is courageous because by portraying a God of universal grace and love, and not a humanistic God often portrayed by some authors in the Bible, Spong rejects literal interpretive, \\"pick and choose\\" theoglogy built to perpetuate political power and subservience to authoritarian institutions like the church.  Spong instead recommends a truly personal relationship with the true nature of God, using the teachings of Jesus to guide us to the Creator.  I'm not surprised by the number of death threats Bishop Spong gets, prophets continue to be misunderstood by the masses looking for re-affirmation of belief rather than the more the difficult journey towards a better understanding of reality.cause by portraying a God of universal grace and love, and not a humanistic God often portrayed by some authors in the Bible, Spong rejects literal interpretive, \\"pick and choose\\" theoglogy built to perpetuate political power and subservience to authoritarian institutions like the church.

I know of no other book that could make this claim.  Quite simply, no one has crafted what Mr. Brown has crafted in regards to communicating the effects the opening had on Indians, including their perspective on how this effected them personally, spiritually, and culturally.  The lessons these people teach us have stayed with me for years; I try and emulate their dignity, their love for their country, and their love for each other, and easily admit their bar is set too high for me.<br /><br />This book is also a great lesson that reading history only by the  victors insures you really don't understand history at all.  A great re-affirming lesson to me.<br /><br />Besides its incredible impact on American history, its also an easy forthright read, if you don't mind crying about 20 times.  Thus, I believe it should be a reading requirement for all high schoolers, especially in this day and age when many of our churches and politicians preach and condone bigotry and hatred of the \\"other\\".	2005-04-24

More recently drilling for oil in the The Pigeon also caused some of the most notorious environmental battles that ever took place between a state, the oil industry, and environmentalists.  Three different court cases made it to the Michigan Supreme Court and those rulings had a large impact on environmental law related to drilling in wild natural areas.<br /><br />The book is also a trail guide, providing tables of fauna and flora that exist here.  The Pigeon is the only woods east of the Mississippi that contains wild elk, which are pretty easy to track if you go in with a local or get some advice from the State's Dept. of Natural Resources officers who are stationed in the forest.<br /><br />The Pigeon also contains three world-class trout fishing rivers, two of which are also navigable by more experienced canoeists.  There is a major hiking / mtn. biking trail that runs through it as well, providing day and overnight wilderness experiences.<br /><br />I've traveled all over the world, lived in CA twice and FL once, but I knew the Pigeon would draw me home to commune with the elk, coyotes, bears, the white pine and cedars, the Beech and Maple trees, and the bald eagle.  The Pigeon is still a fairly wild place with many contiguous sections with neither roads or trails, allowing for a North Woods experience guaranteed to be people-free.<br /><br />Franz' passion for the Pigeon rings through truly.  Sometimes the book gets a little long-winded about the beauty of rain drops on a leaf, but if you read this on the trail, you'd never consider entering this tract of land without this wonderful guide as your friend to a  better understanding the Pigeon River Country.	2005-04-24

Most likely because you tend to accept the Bible almost as if it was written in an instant from the hand of God Himself rather than by humans over the course of many centuries.<br /><br />Miles' book was extremely helpful to me in terms of reading the Bible from the point of the view of the biblical authors and the authors' perspective of God and the role he plays in human history. By focusing on the author of a particular book, one is able to separate an author's perspective of God from God Himself, with the result that God begins to shine through the inadequacies of the author's attempts to define God through a human lens.<br /><br />The net effect for me was to conclude that much of the descriptions in the Bible of the nature of a humanistic, and sometimes not very omniscient God, were obviously mere reflections of the authors' sense of reality or the desires of the author in terms of what he wished in terms of actions from God.  By stripping these human filters away, a God of true omniscience shines through.<br /><br />I have the utmost respect for Jack Miles in writing this book because he is essentially helping God clear up all these humanistic qualities that often are used to describe Him.  If you want a better understanding of a God capable of creating such a wonderful universe and are tired of trying to justify to yourself a God who is described as capricious, jealous, regretful, and vengeful, than I highly recommend this book.	2005-04-24

No biographer was afforded so much time, and access to officials, meetings, and documents.  In return, prior to publication Morris concludes Reagan is an opaque enigma, and decides to insert himself into the story as a fictional character that is supposed to help us better understand Reagan by this character having an on-going dialogue with Reagan.<br /><br />I have never in my life experienced such ego as this author.  The book is a mess because the reader is constantly having to concentrate on whether a conversation or event really happened or whether it didn't.  To those who stated one can easily disseminate the fictional Morris character from the non-fictional aspects of the book, I would concur, however, rather than focusing on how Reagan's history is impacting you personally like one normally would, one has to constantly and consciously focus on dissiminating what is, and isn't, real.  I gave up by the time Reagan hit his union years.<br /><br />We had the opportunity to understand a President who will go down as one of our best, instead all the energy that Reagan and his staff put into creation of this historical record will only be helpful to scholars who have the time and energy for exegsis; which is why I give it two stars rather than one.<br /><br />I recommend the Lou Cannon trilogy instead of this book.	2005-04-24

On TV he often appeared awkard, ill at ease, and unable to communicate effectively.<br /><br />And yet one is drawn to him because of his heroics in WWII, his years of public service, from Congress to foreign service, to the CIA, to being a VP.  If only all of our Presidents could have his experience before stepping in the chair!!!<br /><br />This book presents the authentic President, a wonderful, insightful, wise and often funny man who truly loves his country and his countrymen.  If only the far left and especially the far right would emulate him instead of Newt Gingrich and Ted Kennedy.<br /><br />This was a President more like our founding fathers than any other modern President, and this comes across vividly in his letters.  His understanding of our country and its role in the world allowed him to make incredibly difficult, politically unpopular decisions, that were so mis-reported in the Press.<br /><br />Here one gets the sense of the challenges and the rationale for the actions taken.  Who else could have pulled the coalition Bush did for the Persian Gulf War so quickly?  I would argue no one, he was the right man at the exact time we needed him.<br /><br />This is also a great book to keep around and re-read over and over again since the collection of letters, many in story form, can be read in small snippets without needing the stage set.<br /><br />One of the most under-appreciated Presidents, without trying, stakes a position as one of the greats of the 21st century.	2005-04-22

My previous dispassion for the continued separation for church and state turned into enflamed passion to maintain that separation based on events during the 9/11 attack and our eventual response.<br /><br />Armstrong's book is prophetic in describing 9/11 prior to 9/11.  For the terrorists, lack of political power combined with fundamentalist beliefs cause them to justify radical measures against humanity. American Christian fundamenalists, who enjoy political power, will also justify tearing the country apart, only in a non-violent manner from within on behalf of their religious beliefs since those beliefs are more important to them than our secular Constitution and form of government (though they propagandize that they are on the side of the Constitution and our framers).  Armstrong makes strong arguments on the consistencies of all fundamentalist responses to modern, secular, free countries, with the actions taken predicated by the degree of political power possessed, not differences in ideology.<br /><br />Armstrong predicts actions like 9/11 and the rise of the radical Christian right so accurately because her insightful analysis of fundamentalism in general shows that fundamentalists have no choice but radical actions if they are to remain faithful to their ancient dogma which has little value for human rights, liberty, and tolerance for people on matters of faith.<br /><br />This book is well-written, well organized, and helpful in understanding how different fundamentalists have a common sensibility that essentially forces them into radical actions, counter to notions of grace also inherent in each major religion, because fundamentalists by definition base actions on a literal reading of ancient rule-based dogma where \\"we are right\\", \\"God is on our side\\", \\"those that oppose us are going to Hell\\" and \\"Evil is the motivator of those that oppose us\\".  Armstrong reports what these intolerant dogmas are in each of the major religions and how they cause a common objective by fundamentalists of all three major faiths; and the rationale for why the responses differ.<br /><br />I knocked the book down a star because of its length.  I think it would have packed a bigger punch and received more sales if it was a shorter thesis.  The points are all valid, but an editor willing to knock a few examples out of each chapter would have made for an easier read without risk of her readers missing the point.h of the major religions and how they cause a common objective by fundamentalists of all three major faiths; and the rationale for why the responses differ. <br /> <br />I knocked the book down a star because of its length.

I approached this book as a moderate GOP much in love with Reagan and Bush 41.  I never voted for Clinton, but was intrigued by him for several reasons:<br /><br />1)  He was executing wonderfully in '97 (see Morris' \\"Behind the Oval Office\\" for this period), even though the GOP-dominated house had elevated partisan politics to the art form it is today.<br /><br />2)  The Press was crucifying him over Whitewater and I did not understand why, it all seemed so trivial.<br /><br />My conclusions:<br /><br />There is a case to be that Hillary Clinton may have evaded taxes and obstructed justice - while criminal and deserving of  law enforcement investigation, no reason for an investigation against the President instigated by the DoJ.<br /><br />Stewart confirms that the investigation of Whitewater was pure politics of personal destruction.  Bill Clinton did nothing wrong, certainly nothing that demanded any sort of investigation and obstructed his ability to preside over our nation.<br /><br />There were trivial matters that make President Clinton less than perfect, but you can find dirt on any ambituous person.  The question is, did his actions have a negative impact on our country?  This book presents no evidence of that, the only negativity emanating out of this was the ammunition it provided to the GOP and the media to divert our attention from matters of State.<br /><br />One somewhat comic note was the number of idiots that were part of the Clinton circle.  While Clinton was a master at bringing together extremely bright and powerful moderates and attempting to pull the Dems out of the socialistic FDR era, the people he associated with more regularly are a hoot!	2005-04-22

Over the past several years there has been a plethora of books published that have tried to distort that relationship for current political gain.  Consider this a partial \\"corrective action\\" to what is essentially propaganda from some authors with no scholarly credentials.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed reading this book however, there are several concerns that I have regarding this book that doesn't make this the \\"end-all\\" regarding the debate about the role our founding fathers had in mind regarding religion.  First, the authors leadoff with a chapter that sets the stage for \\"why this book at this time\\".  Unfortunately this is not a good start for these authors writing this particular book.  The authors are near perfect in their ability to provide a true picture of our actual history in the middle chapters, but as analysts, the authors get into taking sides politically prior to making their case.  I would have preferred saving the analysis for the end, besides, the history is the most fascinating aspect of the book.<br /><br />In addition many people who need to receive this message, i.e., the religious right who have been fed propaganda by religious leaders like Dobson, Kennedy, and Robertson, could be put off by what they may sense is doctrine opposite, and thus negatively provocative, of what they believe is our true heritage.  It would be a shame for these people to dismiss the book after the first chapter when this book would be more helpful to them than any other category of reader.<br /><br />What I did like about the book was the discussion about where the idea for a secular government came from, Locke, Williams, Paine, and how the framers developed those philosophies into our current Constitution.  While riveting, this discussion is not complete.  Another aspect I enjoyed was rather than just going into what our framers' intentions were regarding the creation of a secular government, the authors also discussed the documentation and verbal debates of the framers' opponents that promoted a non-secular government.  This makes it self-evident that there were sides to this debate back then and who was on which side and those on the side of secularism were clearly the framers, contrary to what some current day propagandists would have you believe.<br /><br />The authors did an especially fine job of portraying the motivation for many devout Christians to create a secular government.  The book features Roger Williams, an extremely devout Christian, who supported a secular government to \\"free churches from the designs of political men\\".  In fact, there is a nice trail that leads from Williams in the 17th Century, to ratification of the Constitution, to the success of Baptists in building a base of members by forcing religion to gain members based on the \\"marketplace if ideas\\" rather than government support - exactly what Jefferson and Madison intended.  The authors provide sufficient history to show how the \\"evangelicals\\"  and Catholics of that day were for the most part strong secularists because they didn't have any political power, but now that these two groups currently compose a significant minority are pushing for the opposite - government power that endorses their belief system, an irony not lost on the authors.<br /><br />Another fine feature is the authors did not depend on quotes by design, which are often used by ideologues on both sides to distort the true history of our founding, instead they discuss political battles and who sided with whom.  Particularly interesting was President Madison vetoing \\"faith based charities\\" for his denomination of Episcopalians, the most potent political group among Christians of that time.  Another great analogy was the fight to stop the movement of mail on Sunday during a time when the Postal Service was much more important to greasing the skids of the market than it is today.  And still more evidence, the fight to change the Constitution's preamble so \\"We the People\\" didn't sanction and empower our government, but rather that our government derive its power from God and Jesus Christ ,with Their attributes defined by the government, much like the European theocracies that caused so much suffering through the Dark and Middle Ages.<br /><br />What I would have hoped for from the authors was that they footnoted.  While they do provide a great bibliography at the end and also discuss their reasons for not footnoting, I don't think one little book is going to dissuade zealots from clinging to lies, footnotes in today's world are imperative.  While I absolutely trust the integrity of the authors, we have an abundance of people publishing distorted tracts that makes it imperative we require all authors to footnote (see Dobson, Robertson, and Kennedy for three examples).<br /><br />I also would have preferred a more robust defense of our religious history.  The authors are great writers, entertaining, engaging, and yet even-handed.  At 177 pages, there was plenty of room to go into more detail regarding Madison, Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton source material; thus providing additional evidence along with their opponents for a more full-fledged portrayal that these men did in fact purposefully set out, and in fact succeeded, to create a secular government and a society where religion could blossom, or whither, based on merit rather than government power.ice was much more important to greasing the skids of the market than it is today.

A primary thesis from \\"The Closing of the Western Mind\\" that has stayed with me is:<br /><br />Prior to Christianity becoming institutionalized by the State in the early centuries C.E., scholars in training received a classical education: mathematics, philosophy, law, humanities, history, some science, and theology.  The great religious thinkers of this time leveraged this educational base to research religious ideas that are still debated today. The process of first getting a broad educational base and then specializing was thwarted when the State incorporated Christianity which in turn took over education on behalf of the State and the Church.<br /><br />By the 4th Century C.E. budding scholars were provided no broad liberal arts base, instead they were indoctrinated with religious dogma; this trend only worsened over time as the Church became more entrenched in the State.  The other disciplines were wanting not for talent, but individuals able to develop their talents since they now started with no solid educational base.<br /><br />After presenting this evidence, Freeman then makes a strong case for the importance of secular governments to defend educating students rather than indocrination of a worldview that requires the rejection of reason and search for empirical truth - regrettably this conflict has once again gained new momentum recently here in the States.<br /><br />The length of the book that some have complained of is justified if all you want are the answers to the questions, for those people I recommend reading the reader reviews.  However, I found the case made by Freeman and the stories that make his case fascinating.  I also came to appreciate some of the Dark Ages Christian thinkers more than I did previously now that I understand the severe limitations of their education based on a dysfunctional religious and political system.	2005-04-05

I loved the format of the book!  Scalia presents his judicial interpretative process, and honestly admits hypocrisy when he occasionally votes ideology rather than using his system.  Then, rather than providing a half-hearted attack on his ideological opponents, he invites them to respond to his thesis, each with their own chapter!<br /><br />You may not agree with Scalia, but you can't doubt his moral courage based on his invitation for criticism in his own book.<br /><br />I also appreciated the chapter on the structure of Germany's Constitution to help us understand why principle, rather than statue, plays such a big role in American judicial interpretative processes.<br /><br />Everyone that cares about the Supreme Court should read this book.  I have yet to find a better book to learn the motivations and processes utilized by each ideological camp.  After reading this book, my ability to understand the logic of the court, for both rulings and the opinions, has been greatly enhanced.<br /><br />While unintended, Scalia also helped cement my personal belief that a blend of original meaning (aka textualism) and abstract principalism, and not Scalia's textualist approach alone, is by far the optimal method for judicial interpretation based on our Constitution.	2005-03-28

Bush Presidency	This may be Buchanan's best book ever, which is saying a lot given his incredibly insightful take on America's future in \\"The Death of the West\\".  Because Bush won the 2000 election running as a Conservative, especially foreign policy, Buchanan holds him to conservative standards and shows how Bush has since rejected conservative policies.<br /><br />The case Buchanan makes is devastating. It's obvious to anyone really wathcing that Bush has pretty much walked away from conservative approaches and replaced them with a mish-mash of ideologies supporting special interests or playing a neo-FDR which Buchanan lays out in a concise, organized manner.<br /><br />In the 2000 debates Gore presented a liberal foreign policy agenda, one where America played an activist role in acting as police and liberator.  Bush responded in those debates with a conservative agenda that played well among conservatives and moderates.  However, once elected, Bush ignored the terror threat to instead support missle defense constituents. 9/11 occured, and then rather following 9/11 with a conservative-like reaction like going to war against terrorism, Bush instead basically ignores our borders, plays police in Afghanistan, and plays Gore by liberating Iraq while spending an inordinate amount of money and resources on Iraq rather than on our borders and against theocratic Sunni Muslims like al Qaeda (see Scheuer's \\"Imperial Hubris\\" for a classic conservative approach to 9/11).<br /><br />Since Bush's election in 2000, America has seen its total wealth go down by several trillion dollars and that the vast majority of Americans are poorer under Bush than they were previously (median net income).  While the conservative media spun their way out of this to protect Bush for the 2004 election, Buchanan goes after Bush for again, implementing liberal economic policies, like being the biggest discretionary spender ever.  Buchanan provides a forthright tax and trade policy that easily surpasses the Bush doctrine as a pro-growth, private investment vehicle.<br /><br />Its obvious that Clinton's policies were extremely successful, not optimal, but successful none the less.  I also happen to believe the conservative economic policies that Buchanan posits in this book would work even better than Clinton's in this decade given that educational progress alone won't support employment objectives when China, India, and Eastern Europe are now able to develop Engineering and Managerial talent and not just cheap labor.  But as Buchanan points out, Bush's schizophrenic approach, cutting the wrong taxes, spending like a drunken pirate, subsidising the wrong industries, and poor trade policy is begging for failure - predictions by Buchanan that are proving even more accuate as time goes on.<br /><br />My only problem with this book is while Buchanan's sense of 20th century history and economics, and his policy positions based on our history is extremely compelling and well-thought out, Buchanan abandons historical accuracy and his usual penchant for honesty when talking about the culture wars.  Buchanan can't admit our founding fathers and their ideals were pro-secular.  While our founding fathers preached laissez-faire on economic and social issues, Buchanan ignores the social side of their ideology and claims a heritage he's undeserving to assume.  While espousing a government that limits its powers in economic matters, Buchanan acts like a Socialist trying to leverage government power to control individuals and strengthen the government's power over the electorate, a very un-American ideal, which is the reason I drop the book from 5 to 4 stars.h, private investment vehicle.

Graham's book shows that bureaucratic silos focused on the departments themselves, rather than objectives like national security, allowed 9/11 to happen.  The case for cross-functional organizations that focus on intelligence and security objectives is well-made by Graham in this book.<br /><br />I also appreciated his perspective as Committee Chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee.  Graham provides great insight into the workings of the Senate, especially also monitoring specific executive bureaucracies.<br /><br />While I agree with him that a better Reagan/Bush/Clinton/Bush focus on terrorism would have prevented 9/11, and that Bush's executive branch had many opportunities to stop 9/11, I don't agree with Graham's final thesis that Bush alone could have stopped 9/11.  I would suggest however that most of what Graham recommends happening in the executive branch IS happening, just not as quickly as potentially necessary since we spent and are spending in inordinate amount of men, money, and material on Iraq rather than fighting terrorism and securing our country from terrorism.	2005-03-28

This book shows RR understood and respected the gray, but after coming up with a policy solution, kept it black and white to ensure his message was understood and show a clear path to meeting the objective at hand.  This book is also a great collection of writings in his own hand that provide irrefutable proof that RR's positions were his, and that he was no mere actor or talking head.<br /><br />While RR does a great job laying out his positions mostly in the collections of speeches he wrote; I do have a few problems with this book and the man himself.  First, we get it, the editor didn't need to include so many speeches that redundantly pound home RR's positions on a couple of topics, especially foreign policy.  Once  or twice is fine, seven, eight, nine times is overkill.  Second, RR's reputation is one of unbridled positivism and optimism, and while he was a true optimist, its untrue, as this book clearly shows, that RR was an atypical politician that didn't go negative.  The RR in this book would take an issue Carter was working and sometimes create a mountain out of a molehill, and like a typical politician, when Carter deserved some credit (admittedly a rare occurrence), RR stayed typically silent, and thus showing evidence that RR wasn't the quite Jesus-like politico some of his supporters make him out to be.<br /><br />The only other criticism I have is that on paper and in his speeches, RR came across as a classic Conservative, which is one of two reasons he is so revered by the right, what isn't provided is material that shows that while RR's voting constituency was mainly the right, RR was a President of the people that actually governed mainly from the middle.  For evidence of his actual actions in office relative to this rhetoric, I recommend David Gergen's \\"Eyewitness to Power\\".	2005-03-28

Hirshson makes the case for the greatness of Patton not just because of the leadership skills so often turned into almost mythical proportions, but mostly because he happened to be the most knowledgeable cavalry officer in the Army. Hirshson's Patton is a great general and a great leader because he knew more than his reports or his peers about the nature of war and the method of success based on the technology of the day.  Success came from more than leadership and willingness to act, it also came from sheer knowledge and preparedness to make use of that knowledge on the battlefield.<br /><br />Hirshson's Patton is more than a blow-hard, he was a student, a technologist, a practioner, and most of all, a warrior that made use of the other aspects of himself he honed before the battle.<br /><br />For anyone interested in Patton or interested in learning from great leaders, this is the book for you.  For senior managers who strive to hire great functional managers but have difficulty controlling their independence, this book will also provide sustenance that contrarian experts are worth it, even though the cost of some obstinacy can cause the occasional stomach twitch or two.	2005-03-28

Ketcham is a true historian, unconcerned with revisionists trying to re-invent our founding fathers.  Ketcham emphasizes the issues that Madison himself focused most of his attention on rather than spending an inordinate amount of time as an apologist for Madison trying to dissuade current religious propagandists who misuse Madison for their indoctrinal purposes.<br /><br />Madison is a unique founding father because unlike Washington, a General and mentor to many of the other founders, Madison was one of the primary architects that coalesced various philosophical points of view into a cohesive, unique, set of American ideals.  In other words, Madison took the dreams of the founding fathers and crafted them into a reality through his development of the constitution and his documentary defense of that document through his publication of many of The Federalist papers.<br /><br />Ketcham perfectly captures this development from historical philosophy to political maneuvering to the actual ratification of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  Ketcham's Madison also provides a steady hand of guidance as President and after retirement to the secularists of his day trying to protect the integrity of the federal constitution from their ideological enemies.<br /><br />Another great attribute of the book is the ease of research regarding subject matter.  The book is well end-noted, it also has an excellent index and also indexes by subject matter as well.  For example, if you want Madison's views on \\"philosophy and views\\", Ketcham provides a subject header and references you to corresponding pages.	2005-03-28

He also promotes the position that Bush's policies have been a weak, police-like approach to dealing with the enemy rather than dealing with al Qaeda in a classic military operation.  He does a great job of laying out our policies that supposedly motivated al Qaeda to attack us and laying out how we are increasing our risk rather than negating it with Bush's somewhat pacifist approach to fighting terrorism.<br /><br />I learned more about al Qaeda in this book than anywhere else.  I also reconciled my unease at our focusing on Iraq rather than fighting a war on terror against Sunni Muslims of the Salafel sect, i.e., that we may be playing into bin Laden's hands by getting rid of his competitor, Hussein, and providing a sort of power vacuum bin laden may be able to assume.<br /><br />Scheuer's perspective as ex-head of the CIA Analysts responsible for collecting information on al Qaeda provide us with an unparalleled American viewpoint.  His grounding in history and his being an intellectual provide the reader with an extremely well-reasoned \\"how we got here\\" and \\"how we get to optimal\\" perspective.  What is concerning reading this book is that one senses that even though Scheuer was probably our top Analyst regarding bin Laden, his perspective, unlike the Jack Ryan of Tom Clancy fame, goes unheard at the Bush/Cheney level.<br /><br />Also, as a point of interest: it just recently became public that Scheuer happened to be the CIA agent responsible for the creation of our current rendition program that has led to so many successes in regards to getting information that has helped destroy terrorist operations against us and also helped us capture additional terrorists.  While the rendition program is not popular with the liberal media, Scheuer has recently confirmed that from a national security perspective, his rendition program has saved American lives.troy terrorist operations against us and also helped us capture additional terrorists.

I'm sure his friends, family, and neighbors are extremely proud of the Speaker and rightly so.  He is a good man, the salt of the earth, but he is also a lightweight that has allowed politics over principal to prevail in the House he runs.<br /><br />We have a divided nation; Rep. Hastert claims to have attempted to work with the opposition but consistently gets the cold shoulder.  While I believe his examples are real, there is no real in-depth analysis that presents both sides' arguments fairly; instead we get a shallow apology from the right and what appears to be a highly spun-media release on the perspective of the left.  See Bob Rubins' book as Sec. of the Treasury for a great example of a public servant defending his positions while respecting and enlightening us on his position relative to a respectful analysis of his opponents.<br /><br />Rep. Hastert does not go into any substantial detail on WHY Gingrich was outsted as Speaker, even though his perspective would be invaluable.<br /><br />Hastert also provides no real insight on his policy positions or what the driving factors were in the House regarding the policies debated beyond mere vote whipping.

However, Buchanan is one of my favorite authors for several reasons evident in this book.  First, Pat sees the forest from the trees.  What other ideologue, either left or right, writes a thesis at the level Pat writes at?  He doesn't care so much about a particular law or judicial ruling as he does what major sociological trends will cause America pain and thus should be dealt with now.  In this book that is that immigration policy and declining birth rates will cause America to have a future identity crisis.  How can anyone dispute that, we are in the middle of a culture war now!<br /><br />Pat is at his best on foreign and economic policy and the major social factors that drive our policy approach. He probably knows 20th century foreign policy history, and conservative evolution in reaction to that history better than anyone.  This provides Pat with great insight into future policies regarding taxation and trade.  However, he is at his worst in terms of his ignorance regarding the founding ideals of our country and the revolution that took place in the 1960s, thus his response to certain events can be and often are based on misperceptions of our past.  While he's right that immigration trends and birth rates are driving an unprecedented change in how Americans will interface with their government, I humbly believe he is too quick to condemn immigration as a whole when controlled immigration can in fact be our savior relative to our declining birth rates.<br /><br />Another great reason to read Buchanan is unlike nearly all other conservative writers, Buchanan is honest.  He doesn't spin, he doesn't conveniently leave-out critical information to make his case sound better, he doesn't toe the party line even when it opposes current GOP policy. Politicians come and go, but the conservative viewpoint will be with us for a long time, when Bush 43 the quasi-liberal/conservative leaves, it'll be Pat providing continued insight into the real conservative mind.  Pat is ALWAYS consistent.<br /><br />You don't have to agree with his thesis to love this book ,which I don't; the fact he's gotten me thinking more clearly about these issues is reason enough to embrace this book.l conservative mind.

We possess this mythical impression of Washington as almost being a God and not a mere mortal; yet his accomplishments in so many areas make it hard to refute his greatness.<br /><br />I also recommend this book in order to help people understand and promote politicians that exemplify Washington's personal attributes rather than promotion of the opposite.  Our closest modern-day approximation of Washington would be Reagan, with President G.W. Bush being the anti-Washington.  Washington was a great self-made man, with varied interests, experiences, and accomplishments that provide us with an example and a timeless definition of  \\"emotional intelligence\\". Randall does an excellent job of defining the true greatness of Washington.<br /><br />My criticism of this book is similiar to others, especially that more emphasis on Washington as President is warranted.  This book will not make you an expert on Washington, it will help you appreciate the greatness of the man and his role in freeing us from tyranny.	2005-03-28

By serving Presidents from both parties, Gergen forces Republican and Democratic readers to set aside their party loyalty to confront the reality that both parties have had recent Presidential successes and failures.<br /><br />For example, I was a proud Reagan youth who didn't vote for Clinton in 1992 However, by 1996 I had to admit that Clinton was doing an excellent job of leading the country in spite of my party's obstructionist activities that only hurt the country.  Gergen explains how Clinton was able to overcome and succeed in spite of opponents intent on political destruction rather than serving their country.<br /><br />Gergen also provides excellent examples of what many of us realized by 1984 about Reagan, that while his rhetoric mainly appealed to the conservative right, Reagan was truly a President to all Americans and governed from the middle.<br /><br />If are you interested in presidential politics and care more about the country than you do about your party, this is a great case study.  If you are a senior manager responsible for large numbers of people, this book is also an excellent manual on managerial success using your own style and approach.  If you are looking for ammunition to do battle against ideological opponents, this is not the book for you.	2005-03-28

Kenneth Starr's [[ASIN:0446527564 First Among Equals: The Supreme Court in American Life]], Randy Barnett's [[ASIN:0691123764 Restoring the Lost Constitution: The Presumption of Liberty]] and Antonin Scalia's [[ASIN:0691004005 A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law (The University Center for Human Values Series)]] are three excellent starters.<br /><br />The issue at hand is judicial activism and tyranny.  Rather than a respectful analysis of original intent, original meaning, and abstract principalism (the three major interpretative methods) as debated in Antonin Scalia's \\"Matter of Interpretation\\", this book defends \\"originalism\\" vs. a court hijacked by \\"the extreme left\\". Problem is, while some liberal rulings have been activist, so have many conservative rulings.<br /><br />This author is actually advocating extreme activism, without telling you, by moving towards an \\"originalist' method (really original intent), without revealing this to the un-learned reader. Original intent is a method that actually promotes judicidal activism because it provides opportunity for a judge to ignore the actual principle(s) and as Scalia argues, original meaning in the Constitution.  Original intent is just as insidious as those promoting a \\"living constitution\\".<br /><br />For example, most Americans would agree our right to freely communicate is explicitly protected by the 1st Amendment and paramount to maintaining the strength of our democratic republic.  This is obvious by reading the 1st Amendment itself based on the liberal method of reviewing the principal explained in the text, using Scalia's original meaning approach (which all liberals on the court also do), while also discovering we never explicitly delegated any powers to government in the Constitution to broadly regulate or prohibit our right to communicate - the latter being the more important aspect.  However, it can be argued that the \\"original intent\\" (the Levin preference for interpretation) of that clause of the 1st Amendment was merely to protect Congressional speech from possible tyranny by the executive branch like British Parliament's protection against tyranny from its king (which is where the text comes from).  This was certainly the intent of many members (Federalists) of the 1st Congress who passed the Bill of Rights, and can be validated when subsequent Federalist members of the 5th Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts which prohibited some speech by those not in Congress.<br /><br />So using the author's own flawed logic, normal, everyday Americans don't have constitutionally protected free speech rights because a so-called strict constructionist judge discovering original intent can find that some members of Congress never intended for all Americans to have free speech rights when they passed the Bill of Rights.<br /><br />Of course to an abstract principalist like Ginsberg or a textualist like Scalia that is absurd.  Free speech as a principal is clearly indicated and is the \\"plain meaning\\" of the text when coupled to the lack of government power which was not explicitly delegated by \\"the people\\" to government (the constitution grants no powers to broadly regulate/prohibit communications).  Levin's brand of jurisprudence is fatally flawed because it seeks to find rights in the text of the Constitution and the notes of the framers when instead the Constitution is to be read where the obligation resides on government to prove it has been delegated powers to regulate or prohibit our activities beyond defending the superior rights of others.<br /><br />Scalia's book makes the case for textualism, which is closely related to original meaning, and opposed to Levin's \\"original intent\\" given its susceptibility to judges ruling on their politics by seeking past arguments (intent) that support their preconceived positions.  Scalia also provides guest writers a chapter to rebut his thesis.  Scalia also provides a chapter that compares the structure of our constitution, where many of our clauses are structured as principals, relative to modern Germany's statute-centric constitution.  This provides a reader a broad perspective of how the three major camps interpret a constitution with an inconsistent structure.  And these prospectives come not from a talking head propagandist like Levin, but instead from serious constitutional scholars.<br /><br />Starr, Solicitor General for both Reagan and Bush I, and yes, the guy that investigated Clinton, wrote a great book on the cases that define the issues most Americans pay attention to regarding the Supreme Court.  Starr's extensive experience arguing before the Court and his respectful presentation of the liberal viewpoint provides readers with a chance to learn the court's and his opponent's perspective.  Thus Starr's readers are provided the conservative, liberal, and Court's perspective; Levin provides only raw meat for the angry.<br /><br />Reading the Starr and Scalia book will provide the Conservative reader with the cases that define the current court and the interpretative methods used by all Appeals Courts.  The Levin book is for those that would prefer to bully their ideological opponents, rather than actually learn why we are where are today.  Would you rather have the perspective of Sean Hannity (Levin), or the perspective of conservatives on the court itself or who have  spent a career aruging before the bench (Scalia & Starr)?<br /><br />Lastly Levin doesn't seem to undertand that courts have a duty to protect Americans from their government, he continuously misinterprets courts striking down legislation as \\"making laws\\" when in fact they are striking down clearly unconstitutional laws designed to deprive us of our freedoms and extend power to the Government, power we never explicitly delegated to government.  Protecting our rights was a primary motivation for creating a judicial branch, not a power the judicial branch usurped by way of Marbury v.

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	4	27	41	N	N	Irrational emigration to the GOP	Franks does a great job of nailing and then explaining my dilemma, being a moderate Republican who embraces limited government and supports the principals inherent in our Constitution experience his party swing towards the start of a theocratic fascism led by Cons in the GOP.<br /><br />Franks has added to the argument that has me leaning towards changing party affiliation to being a Democrat, not because I learned anything new or inspiring about the Democratic party, but because Franks piles on even more evidence about how anti-American Con ideals are and how harmful they are to our country. In fact, the very platform changes the Dems have made since '96 is the positive motivator for me to consider changing and these are policies Franks despises. Thus, Franks makes a great case for rejecting conservatism, but doesn't make a great case for why the Democrats shouldn't continue down a path of moderacy rather than reverting towards an old-fashioned populist/socialistic agenda Franks prefers.<br /><br />I appreciate Franks' point that the numbers are in a Conservative leaning GOP's favor if the Dems continue down the path Clinton put them on relative to economic and foreign policy.  But I believe that advantage is only short-term if the new GOP's policies are really that flawed as Franks argues they are.  I believe that if the GOP does continue to act on Cons policy positions, enough moderate republicans will be turned-off sufficiently to move to the Dem side IF the Dems become a viable alternative not by embracing the old socialist leaning left, but the vision President Clinton very successfully used of a party where government leads, but doesn't institutionalize, national objectives..<br /><br />I do take exception to a couple of items in his book:<br /><br />1)  Franks explicitly states, and sometimes implies that our Constitution supports the Cons regarding their fight on cultural matters.  In fact, though the media lets the Cons constantly get away with saying they are on the side of the Constitution, the facts are clear that Cons reject major aspects of the Constitution, especially the republican structure of our government, religious tests, super-majorities in the Senate, judicial review and protection of individual rights guaranteed to all people.<br /><br />Franks' case would be even stronger if he understood that today it is the Democratic party that protects our republican form of government, especially in the Senate and in the Judiciary, and as a result, our constitutional protections.  Historically it was the Republicans that protected Americans from their government, that is regrettably no longer true.<br /><br />2)  Franks' desire is that the Democratic party revert back to a form of welfare-state, union-centric economics that can't possibly work in a global economy.  I would have preferred that Franks get on the band-wagon that our best economic strategy is to vote-in a federal government that leads us towards increased intellectual capital and an energy-independent paradigm by way of increased college and high school graduation rates where the curricula is as rigorous or superior to \\"best in class\\" countries like Hong Kong or Finland along with leadership by Washington on quickly developing an alternative energy supply.<br /><br />Long-term, our ability to compete will be based on America differentiating itself from other countries by its ability to develop new markets and having a work force capable of supporting these new emerging markets, especially the Energy Industry.  This disconnect makes him an easy target of Cons, by definition the most close- and narrow-minded people in existence, that his method would put the working class in even worse straits than it already is a valid criticism, and thus the audience that really needs to understand his overall message has a way to discredit and ignore the portions of his message where he is right.<br /><br />3)  Franks, while briefly commenting on the WWJD movement (\\"What would Jesus Do?\\"), appears to imply that the Cons policy approaches are in line with the principles of Jesus more than the Democratic party.  This is absolutely false.  The Democratic party's platform and approach to government is much more in line with the principles of Jesus than the Cons on all policies with the exception of abortion.  Franks had a chance to gut a Cons major premise and fails to go for it.  He gives them \\"moral values\\" when I believe its clear the Democrats, in behavior of their elected officials, their position and voting records,  and their approach to government, are much more \\"moral\\".<br /><br />4)  Franks states creationism / intelligent design is a theory.  It is NOT a theory, evolution is an accepted theory, intelligent design is a hypothesis, and one in which no credible cross-functional group of scientists have even attempted to move from an hypothesis to a theory, let alone a peer-reviewed or accepted theory.  Franks, like most in the media, appears to not understand the difference between hypothesis, discredited hypothesis, theory,  peer-reviewed theory, and accepted theory.  Intelligent Design currently deserves as much attention in our public schools as the hypothesis that humans got here via a space ship captained by Scooby Doo.<br /><br />5)  Franks states the lie that Bush's performance on economic matters has continued to enrich the nation while hurting the working class.  In fact, our country has lost several trillion dollars in assets since 2001. Energy and Telecom are the only micro-economies to see increased market capitalization during Bush's tenure, add to that our increased current accounts deficit and sales of national resources at business liquidation prices and America's balance sheet has dropped by $4 - $6 trillion dollars under Bush's stewardship.<br /><br />The only industries getting wealthy from Bush's management is Energy, polluters, companies who can successfully lobby to write their own legislation (e.g., big food), and subcontractors to an increased federal bureaucracy, especially security.  Franks appears to make this point in hopes of re-starting a class war when instead he should be arguing that we should sweep the current GOP out of office because of their mismanagement to the detriment of nearly all Americans.<br /><br />However, these criticisms are minor to Franks' enlightening us on how the GOP has successfully recruited voters who historically voted for the liberal left in spite of the fact the policies of those they now support in the GOP directly and negatively impact their supporters and hurt the country overall.policy approaches are in line with the principles of Jesus more than the Democratic party.
