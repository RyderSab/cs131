The action was minimal, but the reason is because J.K. is setting up the whole Franchise for the Grand Finale. The Half Blood Prince, is a good edition because we learn alot about The evil around Harry and who they were in the past. We learn how Voldermort stayed alive all these Years.

With every summer I know a Preston/Child novel is not far away and this year we have Dance of Death. A good novel about 2 brothers, one evil the other good, both equally matched with cunning whit and genius in a battle to destroy each other.  <br />The novel is well thought out and very entertaining.

Crowd Rips me apart I just want to tell you that this is my 4th Irving Novel. I have read GARP (AWESOME), CIDER HOUSE RULES (GREAT), A WIDOW FOR ONE YEAR (GREAT) and they rank amongst the best novels I have ever read. But Circus just didn't have the taste of the others. Circus was just too long, Disjoined, rambling, wordy and at times tedious. I was having a hard time feeling for any of the characters in the story line. I will admit I did enjoy Miller's character  the surreal missionary with Identity problems, but it just wasn't enough to save \\"Son\\".   Now don't Get me wrong folks, I LOVE thats \\"LOVE!\\" John Irving, however we are all entitled to a clunker. Son was that Clunker thus far. Now we did have the signature Irving Situations:  Death, Sexual oddities, Freaks, Homosexuals, Drugs, Animals and quirky characters with weird issues, but the story line, the venue and the entire genre just didn't work. I hate to say it, but this novel did ramble and it needed to be tightened.    I would love for him to write a Raymond Chandler type novel from Start to finish. Good effort but beware this novel had to many small parts and tangents that it caused the story to sputter, choke, stutter, and bore.	2005-07-01
US	41509517	R2ZLCD0ULACEC6	0553584502	303170656	The Taking	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Not my favorite.	I have read about 20 novels by Koontz and I can't lie about it, this is one of my least favorites. I just wasn't sure where the novel was going early on and that is what ruined it from the onset. Koontz didn't make me love the characters to wanna cheer for them at all. I felt it was thrown together too easily and it was a tad clichd. I remember I was at page 200 and I had to stop and say; what the heck? Nothing is happening here, the action was minimal and the characters were wooden...(to me) The ending was a bit of a let down as well. <br /> I have to say wow, Koontz has written like 5 books in 2 years, this is too much. The stories are not as sharp and tight as they used to be. Dean slow down and write a tight good novel like Whispers. We will wait patiently for them. I will definitely continue reading Koontz, I am and will always be a great fan of his. <br />	2005-06-08
US	41509517	RQVCKB1WTGOYQ	0802130208	161411385	A Confederacy of Dunces	Books	5	4	7	N	N	BRAVO!	In a sentence, this novel BLEW me away! I thought that a Prize winning novel would be stogy and intellectually stimulating or code for a (snooze fest). I love Ignatius and his quirky character. Think of this novel as a George Castanza meets Frankenstein. The characters are quirky and Hilarious. J.KT creates long passages of dialogue between Ignatius (the pigheaded fool) and his neighbors, mother, bosses, co-workers, strippers, police and girlfriend, all with hilarious outcome.  <br />Ignatius just has to open his mouth even when you know he should keep quite. He is Fat, Lazy, cheap, arrogant  and a genius with Diction. I had to use a dictionary in some instances just to follow his words. But this is a novel where his miserable behavior doesn't go unpunished. For the life of me I can't understand why this was never made into a movie, play and even a musical. The Misadventures of Ignatius Reilly. This is one of my favorite novels I have ever READ PERIOD!!! <br />	2005-06-03
US	41509517	R2OXDW2QEW5ALO	0553584499	471304969	Odd Thomas	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Interesting departure for Koontz	I just want to say up front, that I know I gave this book 3 stars but this is only in comparison to other Koontz books. Odd Thomas as a novel is a good one, so don't get me wrong. However, this is a different flavored novel than I am used to from Dean Koontz.  <br />I will say that ODD THOMAS read like a Stephen King novel. Odd, Odd's Parents, the eccentric writer all resonated with the Stephen King quirkiness I remember from his novels. But in a way Koontz does a better job than King, in that he doesn't have his characters ramble on and on so much. Koontz, was always able to write a much tighter story than King and here he proves it again.  <br />Odd, being different from other Koontz works surprised me. I wasn't sure if I would like the novel at all, but I soon started liking the Odd character, he is a nice, logical, peaceful individual that had lousy parents and friends. So he was actually the good one here.  <br />Anyway ODD is able to see the dead and has some ability to sense if evil is coming. Typical of Koontz, he doesn't tell you what it is till the end and that was what kept me glued. I thought the ending was a good one and it really made you fall in love with Odd. I did like the novel for that.  <br />However, I think that the novel lacked from his others in that it moved a lot slower than his other works, but I can see that after 40 years of writing novels, Koontz is able to reinvent himself by throwing caution into the wind and giving us a strange character that is just plain odd. I understand that Koontz has a sequel coming out in November call FOREVER ODD. I am curious to see where that novel will take our friend ODD. <br />	2005-05-27

No lag time in this novel, we are moving and a shaking.   In D.F. we are dealing with a Voodoo vendetta against a Mafia Drug family, by a Haitian drug dealer who wants revenge for the death of his brother. How he kills his victims is very interesting, sending out an army of goblin like creatures with large claws that are virtually indestructable.   The police officer assigned to the case gets involved and the Voodoo army turns thier sights on to his family. With that being said, the chase is on. The last 3rd of the novel is pure chase and breakneck speed, and it is fun to follow along.	2005-05-23
US	41509517	R1VJJJWC0DMOCK	0312995423	201960968	Digital Fortress	Books	3	1	3	N	N	A Good First Effort	I read every Dan Brown book and Digital Fortress is the last one so far. I did like it better than Deception Point, but it pales in comparison to the Langdon novels.  <br />In Digital Fortress we are presented a dilemma by a hacker that has hacked into National Securities (NSA) most powerful computer. If the Hacker gets his way electronic destruction will occurr unless the heros can locate the special code that can unlock it and end it's countdown. Problem is the Code is in Spain and there are sabateurs out there doing thier best to make sure the code falls into the wrong hands. <br /> The pace of DF was well maintained, the clues were fair, I didn't care for the hoaky dialogue, as well has the 2 dimensional chacters. But over all it was a decent read, just to fluffy for my tastes.	2005-05-18

I found the main charactors likable and interesting. Again Koontz added a touch of his famous chase sequences.<br />In this novel Marty the main charactor is confronted by a guy who looks just like him and has a willingness to steal his family for himsalf. Fights and chase pursues, shots fired and cars smashed. Alot of fun and a great Villin, all around. enjoy!	2005-05-12

I did enjoy THE MASK alot, this was a good eerie novel dealing with reincarnation, it seemed obvious in the beginning, but like any Koontz novel the obvious lies within the unobvious, and when we are finally allowed to look outside the box, we are shown a bigger picture than originally thought. I did enjoy the supernatural element, but The Mask did have a few flaws that kept it from greatness: One being, that Koontz, never really explains the supernatural element that was tipping off the main charactors; were the spirits good or bad? Also, the book ended too abruptly,It was wrapped up in 10 pages. We never know the fate of the charactors, did they live happily ever after? But over all I'll try to stay positive and The Mask is a good early novel for Koontz.	2005-05-03
US	41509517	R2JC5V8BSYRT3F	0425099334	756586674	Shattered	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Great for a Flight	Shattered, was probably Koontz's shortest and fastest novel in terms of material I have read. I thought that he was able to keep the story going with little or no lagging. I thought the villian was good, yet there could have been more detail about his angst. I did find the protagonist Alex a decent fellow, who has a cowardly demeanor, who has to pull together to resolve the situation. But this novel will be a great movie, if done right.	2005-04-27

I just finished this novel, and thought Koontz did a great job of using a Vietnamese-American protagonist as the lead for a change. In this novel Tommy Phan is being chased by a small Voodoo type rag doll. Along the way he meets a quirky girl Del and together they must rely on thier skills and whit to out manuever this evil doll. The chase is on and we deal with car chases, boat chases and explosions. I thought that Koontz added a nice amount of comic situations...especially at the fateful ending. This is a departure for the normal Koontz novel and I welcome it. Alot of fun for the beach or where ever.	2005-04-25

I will say that this was a cold, sinister novel dealing with  subliminal suggestion. The concept is great, but there was a lack of love for any of the characters I feel.   I really didn't have that cheering them on attitude toward anyone. Also what was missing was the mystery element that Koontz is known for. From the get go...you knew the bad guy, and the reason for doing it. I realize that he was a new author in 1977 and he was still honing his skill.I would be prefer to be left guessing all the way through, but Koontz is intitled to shake it up a bit. Now don't get me wrong this was a good novel, albeit not his best I still recommend it.	2005-04-19

Here we have Junky: a novel written by one of the most twisted yet interesting writers of his day. Burroughs tells a story of what it was like to be a heroine addict in the 1920's and 30's. How he had to find crooked pharmacists and had to watch out for the cops. I thought it was interesting that he mentions how the use of heroine has strengthened him to living a long life. But who knows he did die at 89. So maybe he was right or lucky. He goes into quite a lot of detail regarding the ups and downs of heroine addiction. Never a dull moment.	2005-04-19

A mystery, killings, repressed memories and a good twisted ending. I enjoyed the Vision, but I didn't feel it was his best effort. I kind of figured out who the killer was, and thier behavior was just way out there. Along with Whispers this has got to be one of the sickest villians Koontz has put together.  <br />In this outting a woman sees visions of a killinig and tries to lend her hand to the police. When a set of killings start to get too close to home our hero must use all her powers to solve the crimes. But careful who you look for, they just might be someone close to you or not. Fun story.	2005-04-14

We are presented a mystery and many pieces to a puzzle along with adventure thoughout until the ending finally reveals the big picture. Well I have to say Koontz is a great closer to his books and that is a important aspect to readin a novel...to me. In this novel a serial killer is after a psychic who is able to see his crimes. Our hero is at work on a late night with a blizzard raging outside 40 floors in a scyscraper with his girlfriend while our killer in after him. Great story telling up until the ending...and just when you have it all locked up Koontz twists a little harder and learn even more. Good read.	2005-04-11

This little gem was written in the early 80's when Kootnz was still fresh with ideas. I admit the beginning was slow as we start to learn more and more about the main charater and what she finds out.   In this novel Sarah Thorton has woke from her 3 week coma.  She is tended to by many nurses and a caring doctor, all seems well until the evil visions start to haunt her. Are they live or are they memorex? I can't tell you but I will say this novel's ending was nothing as I expected it would be and it totally blew me away. I had to read and read to find out what is going on here????!!!! Great read, thats the way to end a book and make me sit back afterwards saying WOW that was good.	2005-04-11

I see that after Whispers, Koontz then started putting his name on more of his works. After Whispers all his other novel's written under different names started to be republished with the Koontz label. Whispers has a great story, and one that keeps you guessing. I was always asking myself what and who is this killer that he is able to return from the dead. The villian is one of the most sinister and evil one I have come across in a long time. It seem like there are people out there with his thoughts. (Shivers going down my spine.) I loved the buildup to the end where we learn the secrets of Bruno the Killer. Read this X-file type novel.	2005-04-11

This a a story concerning 2 teanage boys. Colin the quiet nerd and Roy the popular funguy who just so happens to be a maniac. In this novel we are shown how an impressionable misfit can be pressured into being something he isn't (a Killer). From then on Roy proceeds to make Colin look crazy, dangerous and downright bad in the eyes of his parents and locals.   Colin being pressured then decides to match witts with Roy and that makes for one good night of reading. Alot of fun and  realistically eerie at the same time. Kudos Mr. Koontz.	2005-04-11

I think Polanski should have turned this novel into his rendering of the Polish Jewish Ghetto. I admit I am not Jewish, but Uris's novel are so detailed and in your face. I thought he did a masterful job or slowly building the tension up as we aare presented facts that actually occurred, yet we had a front row seat. When you hear about how Poland was invaded or how people were imprisioned on the news it is hard to grasp. With Mila 18 you are in the middle of the action, and you can hear, see, smell and feel the pain that went on there. I strongly urged to have people who love war novels that deal with extraordinary men under extraordinary circumstances read this post haste. Think about it, people who were going to die in the camps, now fighting the Nazi's with nothing to lose. Many of the Nazi soldiers knew this and didn't want to die,many were terrified of the Jewish rebels for over a month. A MONTH! Great Dramatic read. My only contention was that I could never really warm up to any of the main charactors on a buddy buddy level.  <br />Good read.	2005-04-08

Nightfall brings back John Corey, his crude, tough but lovable anti-hero. I think that Demilles dialogue is whacky and just plain fun.  <br />Here we are presented a story that deals with the disaster concern Flight 800 over Long Island. I admit that the subject matter was thin but Demille does manage to stretch he story telling prose to almost 500 fun pages. Sure this novel is not Plum Island or Up Country, but I will say Demille's worse is better than lesser known authors' best. Cheers	2005-04-08

One thing I love about these guys is that no matter how they tell a story, some good, some bad, but they are good over all compared to the rest of the junk that's out there. This is Brimstone a story of murder, mystery, intrigue and great settings. In this novel we have the teaming up of Agent Prendergrast and Vincent D'Agusta after a strange mystery of bodies that have seemingly spontaneously combusted. How, these things happen always are the thing that appeal to me in their novels. I strongly recommend Brimstone, though it is not the best they have written it is up there.	2004-10-04

As you read you are never sure who is telling the truth and who is not...It really makes you bite your nails and question what you think is going on....that is a good story to me. <br />I  feel they should re-release this novel because it is very indicative of our times now.

This book albeit heavy but with a light touch has so much going on, yet it is told with ease. Here were are introduced to Sam Clay a Jewish boy in Brooklyn and Joe Kavalier, Sam's cousin, just in from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia and a Jew who escaped. <BR>In America Joe and Sam share the same fascination of Comic books and decide to create their own character called the Escapist. A crime fighter who gets out of difficult situations and saves the less fortunate, but the symbol of this character is so significant in that the escapist is a alter ego of Joe, who is throughout the novel trying to find and get his family trapped behind enemy lines out to America. <BR>We are taken through the years of these two cousins, starting a Americana institution, we are shown, how they got there comic off the ground, mingle  with celebrities, crooked publishers, Nazi terrorist and eventually expand into going off to war. <BR>The scene where Joe is in Antarctica is a great story and is very exciting, I like that part the best. <BR>Kavalier and Clay is a wonderful book, and has a lot to offer, it is long and the print is tiny, but it is a good story if you can just be patient.	2004-04-23

I will not go into the story because many have done that already below me, but I can say that if you read this book, there will be one character that you can relate to.

In this novel, Demille takes us literally up country to locate a old NVA soldier who witnessed a murder from the war days of 2 American officers. The trouble is it is in Vietnam, and in the north of the country no less. The journey begins and Demille gets to work. <BR>First realize that with Demille your gonna get your monies worth, he writes very literally and explains everything from soup to nuts. If you can be patient your gonna be happy. Again we meet Paul Brenner from The Gerneral's Daughter: funny witty but tough as nails. I love how Demille makes his humor roll and roll, I love funny things and Demille and I share the same sense of humor. Also ironically Demille mentions Sen. John Kerry in the book and how he was a fellow Vietnam veteran, and now he is in the news poised to be the next president. I recommend it but be patient and open minded.	2004-03-12

This book for me was one of them. Dan Brown's writing style is fantastic, his story and intrigue are so well laid out that it had me guessing till the very end. <BR>The premise alone was interesting, to solve the riddle of the Illuminati, an ancient order founded to destroy the catholic Church. Our heroes must find a ticking time bomb somewhere under the Vatican, as well as four kidnapped Cardinals slated to be elected Pope before they are killed. I loved how at any given moment there was a mystery or a puzzle that needed to be solved; always building up the tension and making you want to read on to see what will happen next. THIS IS GOOD WRITING. (Unlike my writing, LOL.) I don't know how many times I can repeat it, it was great!!!.

I thought it looked really interesting, so I gave it a try.<br />This was a very good story. King really turns up the tensions and makes you feel that the main charactor is either lossing his mind or is just a victim of a sick individual. King never clearly explains and we are never quite sure until the end, when it is revealed. It had me on my toes and I was dying to see how it ended.

You ask; because their stories are both fast paced and exciting. I have read many writers who give you an adventure tale that are so far fetched it is not even fun anymore. I like fiction, but not science fiction. This Story deals with a Girl who's father (an archeologist of Native American Studies,) turns up missing and it is up to her and a rogue team of scientists to find him and solve the mystery of a lost city in the desert. That is just the start, I haven't gotten to the fun part yet, here were are faced with diseases, mad scientists, witchdoctors, flash floods and great romance. I strongly recommend it. This is a good book for the road or air. I will not steer you wrong.	2004-01-21

I thought it dragged a bit, and the facing of the monsters wasn't really well played out. I will say I did enjoy them bringing back all the charters from the 1st novel and they had some great dialogue, and also thought the conspiracy plot and the method of release was pretty good too, but it just lacked the fun of the first novel I think.	2004-01-21

This book is quick but very powerful, the images are very simple and basic, but that is not to say they are not profound and provocative.

Unlike other Philip Roth novels, this one was very user friendly, the story was a straight forward account of Nathan Zuckerman, the alter ego of Roth. In this story Nathan has published his PORTNOY like novel, and how he deals with the success of such a novel. We are shown how his life is affected and how it affects others. Whether it be groupies, kidnappers, ex-lovers, angry fans and adoring celebrities. I thought the story was fun, light and a great joy to get through. Check it out.	2003-12-04

It took me a while to finish STRANGERS, but that is not to say it was boring, it was actually a huge Robert Altman esq. sized thriller. Dean Koontz, has really got talent, to be able to write so many complex novels at the pace that he does, is  really impressive. Strangers, is a large intricately written novel about the lives of several people who for what ever reason have a bond together. Strangers basically shows how all the characters come together and it is amazing, the relationships between the people is really told well and the ending is a bit rushed, but the build up is amazing. I will warn those out there it can get a little tedious and I think there were a few too many characters to follow, but if you can stick it out it will be a worthy entry in the Koontz line up. I really don't feel I need to go into the particulars, but I will say it isn't his easiest novel to read. But if curious, give it a try.	2003-12-01

I expected to read a novel about the assassination of a Greek leftist and the mystery of finding the perpetrators through an investigation. Well what I got was a terrible take on the above mentioned, the thugs who carried out the assassination read like they were doing a 3 stooges skit. The plan was awful and sloppy; mind you it was a true story, but the author left nothing to our surprise, it would have been better if he were to tell the story where we do not know the killers and the reporter finds it out as we move along. That way he can still carry out the history and social economic conditions that plagued post World War II Greece while telling a good story. I'm sorry If I offend any fans of the book, but this was not what I expected, I still want to see the film version to see how it translated, but the author here told a factual story while at the same time going off on tangents about the mindsets of the people. Put simply it was boring.	2003-10-20

I just finished C.H.R and I will say that it is a heavier read,and more complex than GARP, But that is not to say it wasn't grand. I have yet to find a writer who can spread words like warm butter, his sentences roll off the tongue with ease. <BR>I haven't seen the movie yet and I will look for it now and to compare notes. I loved this novel, the characters are so vivid and real, the settings, even down to the smells are so clear in this book. It reads like a thousand page novel, but in only 600 pages. There is so much vivid and important detail that it is simple amazing. Irving is one great writer. His story's are so rich. I hope he will write more and more.	2003-10-03
US	41509517	R1L9FP39HTTTYS	0679748989	655716976	The Ghost Writer	Books	4	2	4	N	N	DIFFICULT BUT REWARDING.	Ghost Writer, is a small on length, but big on story. Philip Roth, is a writers' writer, in my opinion. The novel is told in four parts. The first part  revolves around the character of Nathan Zuckerman, an aspiring writer who has the opportunity to meet and chat with E.I. Lonoff an older well established writer, (I feel Roth is referencing Saul Bellow) whom Zuckerman has a extreme fondness for. We see how Nathan tries to impress the famous writer by telling Mr. Lonoff what he wants to hear (or thinks he wants to hear) and by trying to appear intelligent, so is essence Zuckerman is creating his own brand of fiction to keep the attention of Mr. Lonoff.<br />The second part, we are shown how Nathan Zuckerman deals with his family and friends, concerning a few short stories he is about to have published in New York Magazine. These stories poke certain fun at Nathan's immediate family, and his Mother and Father are concerned about the implications that might arise from this happening. (I feel this is how Roth was treated by his family from the publication of his book Goodbye, Columbus.) Zuckman's mother pleads with him to change the stories so not to make his Jewish relatives appear so neurotic, but Zuckerman, doesn't see it that way and believes that the truth is the truth. We are all human, regardless of religion, and people will do stupid things from time to time. This is what Zuckman is trying to relay to his parents and with that said the stories will remain as is. <br />The third part, and by far the most interesting part, is where we meet and learn of the character of  Amy, a Dutch Jew, who after the war arrived in New York and ended up being befriended with Mr. Lonoff. A little too friendly I'm afraid which then causes friction between Mrs. Lonoff and her husband. But here is were the meat of the novel lies. In a nut shell, Roth proposes the question; if only for a moment, what if Anne frank wasn't killed in Europe? what if she is living in New York and doesn'tlead on that she is indeed Anne Frank. I was lost for a moment, but managed to see the truth ring out. This is great writing and a marvelous idea. <br />And finally the forth part, deals with Mr. Lonoff and his Wife which is somewhat comical and not altogether as interesting as the others. I must say for a novel that is only 180 pages, I got so much out of Ghost Writer. Philip Roth is not an easy author to read, and I would recommend him to the faint of heart or those not serious about reading. I will say that the material is heavy and short which makes it a perfect book to devour in a few days time. I will need to read this book every ten years to appreciate its simple complexities.	2003-09-12

Prey unlike Airframe or Disclosure deals with alot of scientific facts concerning the new area of nano-technology (little mini-machines) It this novel our hero, Jack Foreman is a computer programmer turned house husband who is out of work do in part to the internet bubble burst. Jack is assigned a job to figure out why a large quantity of nano particles are unable to be controlled, what then happens is these nana-particles start to terrorize the lab and it's techs. It is a quick enjoyable read, but there are a few flaws in the story line that I had trouble with, like why would a programmer go out and risk his life to stop this swarm of nano particles? I also think the subject matter is pretty complicated for those who aren't too technical.<BR>Yet, this is not O'Henry, there is no truth to be seen here, it is a fun fast read and very interesting at the same time. I thought the ending was very suspenseful and nicely done. <BR>Just an aside, I can see how Michael Crichton's ugly divorce made it's way into this novel, by painting jack's wife as a heartless, power loving B!$@H, I think he was trying to send a message to her.	2003-09-05

Reading Michener is like a glacier flowing, it may be slow...but you can't stop it and it will make to where is has to go. The Drifters is something like that, the book is very well written and powerful but it can be slow at times. I will say that Michener has a great gift to tell a story and his characters are about as 3 dimensional as the guy next to you. This novel is very rewarding if you can just stick it out, and read to the end. I won't get into the characters, because the 40 reviews before me have done that. <BR>Michener writes deliberately and all his words are unwasted, he is able to take many characters and have them move around the world with ease, I enjoyed The Drifters and it will make you want to visit some of the places they visited. The only flaw I saw was that he makes an Israeli/American Jew visit his friends in Morocco in 1971 ...that's just crazy.	2003-08-27

When you want to read a no hassle guaranteed good book, M.C.'S airframe is a book that can certainly share that tile along with many of his other novels. Airframe is as slick moving and as aerodynamic as one of planes described in his novel.<br />The story involves a plane that has an in air accident, people are hurt and questions need to be answered or heads will roll. Critchen takes a technical subject and makes it easy to follow. You will learn alot about the airplane  industry, deregulation drawbacks, corrupt business men, union troubles and immoral reporters. Critchen pulls no punches on touchy subjects and makes it really entertaining. The last 100 pages read like a roller coaster ride, loops and all.<br />In a nutshell, an accident in the air causes many to be hurt. Now the question is cast: Is the plane unsafe? What caused the accident? Will this accident prevent a potentially large contract from being obtained? Who or what will prevent it? Critchen's heroin Casey, must put her reputation on the line as the airplane quality assurance rep, and dig through the mass of technical facts, bureaucracy and overzealous reporters.

I must admit that K.V.Jr is a very intelligent man, and behind his somewhat unremarkable dialogue there is a very large message here. This book has the typical anti-establishment theme Vonnegut is known for. I'm sad to say I wasn't a good audience for his words. The concept of the \\"ice-nine theory was great, but I didn't care for the story three forths of the way through. It ended silly and not what I expected. I didn't cheer for any of the characters, in fact I had no respect for any of them. I will not say it is a bad novel, but it is a bad novel for me at this point in my life. It is a hard novel to grasp, but easy to read.	2003-08-05

I had no idea this wasn't a novel in the conventional sense with chapters and multiple dialogues. <BR>It turned out to be the tribes and tribulations of Alexander Portnoy. A thirtysomething academic sprawled out on his Shrink's couch ranting about his reason for his excessive kinky sexual exploits and inclinations. We are also shown his growing up (in a Jewish Household,) with an overly doting mother and a stern insecure father; and how they were responsible for his neurosis. His parents are similar to the parents of Seinfeld if you ever watched that show. <BR>It doesn't matter if you're Jewish to read this novel, because if you have ever heard your grandfathers or fathers talk about the \\"old days\\" you will relate one way of another. <BR>Philip Roth was very candid in his sexual adventures, throwing just about every taboo out there into the mix. I do admit he speaks harshly about his girlfriends or sex friends being more like it. Also I found it amusing, since growing up in New Jersey, to read about places in Jersey City and Newark that I go to all the time.<BR>Just an aside, the best way to read this book is to imagine you are Portnoy and you are ranting to a Psychiatrist (who never speaks, amusingly until the end) <BR>The Book is the mental ramblings of our main character and after a while the book does have a rough structure and it reads like a comedic Show, I enjoyed it, but it is not an easy read because of it's unorthodox structure, it's somewhat sexist treatment of people and it's harsh opinions of religion. One thing is for certain, no one is safe from the comedic whit of Philip Roth.	2003-07-30

Absolutely amazing, I was skeptical in the beginning to read this book. I saw The World According to Garp: The Movie, and thought it was an awful concoction, of strange sexual behavior and weird characters I felt nothing for. <BR>Just recently a co-worker of mine urged me to read a John Irving novel (THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP) and the thoughts of the film came back to haunt me. I told him that I hated the movie Garp, and wasn't sure I wanted to read any thing he had written. I have been reading for 20 years and have seen every novel since Cider House Rules come out in hardcover only to glance at it with prejudice, thinking to myself \\"there is that guy who wrote that Garp book, which became that awful movie.\\" So naturally, I was hesitant, when my co-worker recommended it. <BR>So one day I walked into  the local Borders and started to check out the Irving Novels; When this younger guy was peering over my shoulder, and asked me if I had ever read any of Irving's novels? I said No! Never; and he told me if I do read any of them,  I have to read GARP first. I began to get nervous. Is this a conspiracy against me to read John Irving? Later that week I saw an old tattered copy of The World According to Garp, for a Dollar on a used book table on Broadway; I thought this must be an omen. So, I purchased the book, and started to read....<BR>Absolutely amazing, absorbing and one of the best novels I have ever read. Irving's words flow to me like a hot knife through butter. I felt apprehension while reading, because I would read the story and wonder how the story was going to continue without sounding too campy or silly. Irving never let me down, he would manage to keep the story going no matter what mud was thrown into the mix. Reading the book was like easing into a warm bad, easy to get started and I was quick to lose track of time. <BR>Reading, The World According to Garp was like watching a Truman Show esq, story, Garp is an individual we watch from all angles, from thepoints of view of his mother, wife, children and trusted friends and enemies and Garp himself. We are show his infidelities, his insecurities, his neurotic episodes of dealing with his mother, wife, children, sexual exploits, his problems as a writer, etc. The story, is quirky and unpredictable with just the right amount of sincerity, you can't go wrong with. I fell in love with Garp and for the first time in my life I became misty at some moments in the book, especially the ending. To make me misty, is good writing. As I read on, I started to frequent used book shops to see if I can find other copies of Irving's novels. Let me say that there are not too many in circulation, which leads me to believe that people are hard pressed to give away their Irving novels because they are something you want to hold on to. I will say that if you want a Grisham, Nora Roberts, or a James Patterson novel there are plenty to find at the used book stores. If you should find a Irving novel in a used book shop and you haven't read it, buy it or it will be gone when you return in the future. I loved THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP, and will read more Irving novels in the future.  6 stars******	2003-07-28

Just to start off, I have been with Preston and Child since the beginning. I was one who read The Relic before the <BR>Film came out and before Mount Dragon was released. Since then I have been the biggest fan of their work, and have read all eight collaborative novels thus far. I always look forward to the month of July every year because that is when  thier new book is released and this year was no different. I loved Riptide and The Ice Limit and will tell anyone interested that those books will never let them down. <BR>Still Life with Crows, albeit a good novel in comparison to other writers in the same league as Preston and child,  is not thier best effort I'm sad to admit. Now don't get me wrong. I thought Crows, was well thought out and the antagonists were much better developed than those of Cabinet of Curiosities. They introduced a lot of creepy characters that you thought most likely to be the ones behind it all; only to see the trail lead to a dead end. <br />In this novel we are again dealing with Agent Prendergrast, the slick, well dressed, quietly rich, (doesn't work for the money) FBI agent, obsessed with the occult, who always seems to find is way to the most juicy and controversial cases around. This is a great character and Preston and Child should have no lack of stories to use him more in the future. I find him reminiscent of F. Paul Wilson's Repairman Jack character, but with much more class and savy.  To quickly describe Agent P, he is the type of guy who could work on a car's engine but never get is hands dirty. Need I say more; But back to the story line there is a killer on the loose killing various town folk in Medicine Creek, Kansas. He leaves the bodies in various stages of mutilation and the clues are limited, but what you think is not what it appears. The killings might not be that organized or are they? I can't say any more because it would spoil it, but I assure you it was well written and  suspenseful. My only problem was that the book's villain and local town folk started to upstage Agent P ¾  of the way through the novel and I wasn't too happy about that. I also thought that Preston and Child didn't put as much time into the Mysteries of the 45s, the 100 year old tail that was supposed to shed light on the modern killings. To me it was quick and not very relevant. I also thought the Killer and why he killed was a bit campy, something out of a B horror movie, and again for that I was disappointed. <BR>Despite those flaws, there is one thing the these two guys do that no other authors can match, and that is the mood and the atmosphere established in there novels. <BR>I love to visit old flea markets or explore old buildings and while doing so I tend notice those old musty smells, the creaky wood flooring and the gray washed out look of poor lighting, I develop thoughts of how the halls of these old buildings were once bustling with employees in a time long since pasted. Preston and Child are able to create those feeling inside of my mind, the old smells of buildings, the dark musty feeling of a cave or house, they are great at doing that, they can write about rust better than anyone I know, and I mean that sincerely. The final 100 pages of this novel incorporated those attributes into a great adventure through the labyrinths of a cave system that lies under the town of Medicine Creek. Oh, just an aside,  that was another flaw I found in the novel. :-(  During the final scenes, while in the tunnels many of the characters discovered rare artifacts and new passage ways that the town folk in Medicine Creek never discovered or mentioned in over 100 years. But they just happened upon them with in just a few short hours and in the dark no less; but hey this is fiction and you have to suspend disbelief sometimes. <BR>Remember these guys have written some of the best action/techno thrillers around, and with that body of work under their belts, I can certainly overlook  a few flaws in this novel. It wasa great adventure, not as complex as The Cabinet of Curiosities or Thunderhead, but definitely up there, read this book for the fun of it. Michael Critchen lookout!<BR>Another great job Gentleman. See you next July!      <WAVING>.	2003-07-17

After reading The Goblet of Fire, I was a little disenchanted with the Harry Potter series, however after reading, Order of the Phoenix, I realize that I'm back on Harry's side. I thought the 5th installment was a worthy entry into the Harry Potter series. Though it wasn't as fast paced or as adventurous as her earlier works. The Order of the Phoenix and its mammoth 870 pages did have a seriousness that made it a worthwhile read over all. <br />Harry is now 16 yrs old, puberty is taking its toll and Harry is no longer the kid we remember him as. J.K. Rawlings is now taking her characters to new levels of maturity; Harry now faces new adventures in his life, which can't be solved with a wand. We are shown many life lessons and I will admit that I loved that aspect of the book a lot. <BR>As we read along we are seeing Harry Mature and realize that even wizards don't have it easy and that life is not a picnic, as we would like it to be. Hence, Rawlings sheds a wave of reality to her younger readers as well as older ones. I believe she is showing us, that once the bookends we shouldn't think wizards (or ourselves for that matter) don't have it any easier, but we will get what we desire through hard work and trial and error.<BR>But finally the last 100 pages of this book flew by and had me glued for 2 solid hours till it ended, but I think this is a bit large for a children's book but it did flow well and I can't complain. I look forward to volume 6 whenever that will come, Lord only knows	2003-07-08

I'm glad I was reading one of his most acclaimed novels when it did happen, so finishing it made it that much more special. I will admit I did try to read this novel about 15 years ago and couldn't  due to its heavy subject matter, but I'm glad I took another crack at it.<br />I must say that Trinity is a wondrous and expansive novel. Uris weaves many, stories and tales over the years with seamless ease.<br /><br />We are presented with 3 families of different backgrounds, the Larkens (Catholics), the Hubbles (protestants) and the Weeds (Presbyterians). All have an agenda of their own, whether it be respect, money or carrying on a lineage; we are shown each side and how they play on each other. Uris paints a vast portrait of the Irish lifestyles both rich and poor. Friends made and friends lost abound.<br />What confused me before reading this novel were the other reviews, some went on to say that Trinity drew two dimensional characters and lacked depth, and I can say that that  is furthest from the truth. These characters, such as the hero Conor, or his the love interest Shelly, or the power hungry Weed family, each has their side of their story told, and told well. We are carried from the characters' childhood till there mid thirties, and I felt as though I knew each one in and out. This is Leon Uris's most accomplished work, though not my favorite, Armageddon still holds that title, this is without a doubt a great, fulfilling and richly detailed novel about a period and piece of the Irish struggle and how a few people deal with it.<br />We did lose a great story teller, R.I.P Leon uris, you will be sorely missed.	2003-06-30
US	41509517	R1PZYKQ9XPCYI7	0553248642	709366674	The Haj	Books	5	27	29	N	N	WELL CRAFTED AND INTERESTING	Before I began this novel I had to remember two things: one, it is a fictionalized account of a Palestinian family in the 1940's, and two, it was written by someone of Jewish heritage and could be biased. So, should I be lead to believe that this was objectively written? My answer to that question is a resounding yes! I loved The Haj so much, it really opened my eyes to the inner workings of the Palestinian life style. I can honestly see how the Palestinians anger is brought about, but it is not solely derived from the Israeli side that many think. Some will say Leon Uris is not objective in this novel and he paints the Jews as the \\"good guys\\", but this is not the truth. He is only showing behavior in the region and tries to show how this behavior can impact the process of peace. <BR>I also don't think a person like Uris, with such a good reputation would risk his credibility and write something that is filled with one-sided observations. He was brave to tackle such a controversial subject and make it entertaining, exciting, historical and educational. I can really admit that after I read the novel I knew a lot more than before about Palestine, and I won't watch reports on the Middle East the same way again.<BR> I recommend this novel to anyone who wants to learn more about the Arab/Israeli conflict. I love Uris's writing style it is quick paced; yet heavy enough not to rot your brain with aimless junk. My only objection to The Haj was the last 10 pages, it was summed up to quickly and a little bit of a cop out, but the book as a whole is great, and I would love to see it continued from 1955 to the present. So come on Leon, continue this one, from where it left off and bring it to the present.	2003-06-23

This was quite a long biography, but how can a person like Adolf Hitler be written in a short and sweet version. This is without a doubt, one of the best biographies I have ever read, this book deals with Hitler from before birth until after his demise. We are not just shown the war time Hitler, we are shown Hitler the Artist, Poet, Architect, the homeless man (yes he was broke living on the streets at one point folks) and Hitler the demigod. There are no sides taken in this novel it plays out to you like a whirlwind of information getting stories from various people within his inner circle. <BR>   This book is very easy to read, and not too heavy with names nor does it dwell on just one topic of his life. I thought it was a very good depiction of the dictator. I especially liked how Jon Toland would describe Hitlers demeanor when he would receive news of victory or defeat. <BR>   After reading this book I can see parallels between Hitler and Saddam Hussain. These men have been in power so long that they come to believe that they are Gods to there people and that only they can lead them to glory, despite the obvious doom and destruction that will eventually occur.<BR>  After reading the book, I have to say, the early Hitler had some good points, had he only stayed in Germany and made it a great nation he would have gone down in history as one of the greatest leaders. However what he later did can never be forgiven. Well, the guy never got a college degree, what can you expect. He died a madman no doubt about it.	2003-05-13

I thought he was intense, uninhibited and added a comical element to the industry. Rent one of his movies and compare him to the other male actors around the same time period and see how boring they were compared to this guy. I will say this is no boring read and it is alot of fun to hear about all the people he worked with. Myself, like alot of other people out in the world have fantasized about what it would be like to work in the porn business, and this book is about as close as you can get without actually doing it. It is insightful to the ways of the porno industry, who is a skunk and who is not. He is very candid about sex and the risk of AIDS in the business and he is right to say those things. <BR>However, the feel of the book is that he has an obvious chip on his shoulder and wants to get back at some in the industry with his somewhat vicious commentary. But if it is true, it is true, and if he did it just to sell books that is good too. Either way Paul (aka. Jerry Butler) if you read this review, I liked your book, and I've asked others to buy it and read it. You'll be surprised how fun they think it is.	2003-05-06

Brenner was funny and whitty, but he wasn't laugh out loud funny. But I will admit I thought the mystery was well thought out and exucuted just as well. Demille was able to turn a death of a woman and peal away many layers of curroption to reveal the dirt within the high brass of the Army. I did enjoy the descriptions of a military base and the way brenner would say \\"UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE,\\" which for me being a former Marine brought back memories of an over zealous 1st. Lt who would always lay that line on me and my mates. Drove us Crazy. Anyway I did like The General's Daughter the novel and the movie how ever the book is better as is usually the case. I recommend it.	2003-02-06

I understand it won the Pulitzer, and has been raved about from here to Timbucktu. However I just didn't find &quot;THE HOURS&quot; that entertaining. As a novel it was slow and laboring reading. However like all reviews I try to find the silver lining and here is this novels saving grace(TO ME). M.C. the author was able to show the inner feelings of depression, the internal silent screams so to speak,that we each feel each day. He instilles in he characters those thoughts of shear bleakness of which we call life. Yet many of these characters like the rest of us face our demons day in and day out, till we are withered with age. It is at this point that we reflect on our years and wonder was it all worth it? Thats what the Hours relized for me.<BR>Now, &quot;The Hours&quot; is not a clear cut novel, it doesn't answer all of it's questions cut and dry, it is actually left up to the reader's interpretation on how they should deal with them. Kind of like life, where we don't know why other people behave the way they do, as well as ourselves for that matter. Enough of that topic.<BR>Don't let my thoughts on this novel ruin your wanting to pick it up to read, I think that this novel has alot to say, but I guess I wasn't the right audience for it's words	2003-01-03

I was recommended this little gem of a novel, by my friend, and I must say that it is short, bitter/sweet and thought provoking. Here we are introduced to Michael Berg a young impressionable boy, who like most young male men, yearns for the sex of a woman. Michael then meets up with Hanna an older mysterious character that is both loving and distant, yet who seems to be hiding a secret so disturbing that it consumes her life. <BR>The author, spends little time on embellishments and metaphorically strips his characters to the bare bones. Again short and bitter/sweet story telling up until the controversial ending; which I though appropriate. Give it a try.	2002-12-18

After Plum Island I ran out and read The Lion's game, and again I'm very impressed with Demille's writing style.  This book is BIG, but not heavy at all, and I love that. In this book John is facing international terrorist, who has a vendetta against the USA.. Sound familiar? I found it ironic, that he kept mentioning the WTC, and how the terrorist tried so hard to topple them, only to really have it happen the following year. <BR>This is essentially a cat and mouse game, where John matches wits with \\"The Lion\\" a Middle Eastern terrorist hell bent on revenge. The story, moves along at rocket speed, never getting boring and never losing it's pace, however the ending was a bit weak, but I think it was done for a reason. I will not ruin the ending, but I highly recommend it. Mr. Demille I am a new fan of your work, and please, please don't retire John Corey.	2002-12-13

For some reason with JP I will read the book if compelled to read it from a friend, but I would never pick one up just to read it. However, this is no advertisment to say don't read it, I think all will like it. Please read it if you feel bored and want a quick interesting, twisted mystery.

I don't know how to make it more clear, I loved Plum Island, especially the lead character John Corey he made me laugh out loud (haha) funny dialogue.<br />This is my first Demille novel and I loved his writing style. Demille is very good all around, his characters are well developed, his mystery is well structured, the action is great, and his rap up is fun fun fun.<br />I quickly ran out and purchased \\"The Lion's Game\\" just because John Corey is featured in it.

I knew that Stephen king, after his accident, would have and interesting tale to tell, and my suspicions were correct. The last SK novel I read was Bag of Bones, which I wasn't too happy with, but Dreamcatcher is a whole new ball game. This book had everything in it except the kitchen sink, we have: monsters, evil government members, parapsychology, flashbacks, action sequences, space creatures, space ships, as usual bad language, Blood and guts, very human characters and some funky space fungus.<BR>This story, starts off well, their is a lot to tell about each member of the group of 5 lead members, as usual SK is able to describe each person down to what color socks they wear. This is good, but can be much at times. I did think Dreamcatcher was very involved, and had many twists and turns in it's story line. SK definitely gives you your money's worth with so much material. Many people think that this novel has to many repeats of his past novels, like Tommyknockers, Lonesome death of Jody Veral from Creepshow, Children having powers since there youth like IT. Well despite it all I don't care what other people think I liked this novel and thought it was a nice surprise. The only 2 things wrong with Dreamcatcher were the parts were the alien was inside Joey's mind and were Joey had created a warehouse in his thoughts...ummm...kind of silly. And 2nd was the length of the novel, at almost 900 pages,it could have been shortened by about 2 hundred pages. I also see that there is a holocaust element involved with this book and that was the scariest part of all. I look forward to the movie.	2002-10-09

So I decided to give Connelly's novels a try, so I chose &quot;THE POET&quot; which I found to be very well written and filled with many twists and turns. Connelly sprinkled many details and clues throughout the novel that all came to a head in the end.<br />His a dialogue is realistic, and the main charactor was not this superman that didn't have hang ups or demons in his closet, which also added to the good mix.<br />The only aspect of this novel that disturbed me was the main villian, who is a murder/child molester to the extreme, I didn't like the constant talk of that, but despite it all I did enjoy the novel, how ever the ending was a bit abrupt, and the reason behind why the villian did it was not very clearly explained.<br />It did read like a movie script at times, and maybe that is what connelly is hoping for, if this is the case I think Jason Lee from &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; could play the lead very well. But a good, solid, intelligent, crime mystery thiller.<br />I plan on reading some of Connelly's Harry Bosch series in the future.	2002-09-09

This is the case in Dragon Tears, but the story, lacks the optimistic and satisfying quality that his other novels had. This novel couldn't get me to jump on the wagon to solve the mystery behind the events, in a nut-shell I didn't really care, what happened. I will say that Koontz(as always)keeps the story going and this was an entertaining read, but it just had a dark cheerless spirit behind it.	2002-08-26

By the time Victor Hugo completed Les Miserables he was 60 years old, back in France from a lengthy exile and considered a national \\"Hero\\". And from what I read he was also a nasty ... who never let his novels get edited, and there lies the problem.<br />I believe it was because of his fame that V.H. got away with publishing this mountain of a book.<br />But just an aside, I never saw the Broadway show, I never saw the movies, so I went into this novel untainted and expecting nothing. But what I got was just plain annoyed. This book is about 1,500 pages, of that about 1000 pages are not really needed to tell the tale of Les Miserables, these other 1000 pages are a history lesson or V.H. spin on the air of France at this turbulent time in history; that would be wonderful if you were a history buff or liked to know about France's political atmosphere, but for me, as I'm sure like many others, we were just interested in the story of the people and their plight, it didn't matter if this book took place in France, these people could have lived in Turkey or China. People and their emotions don't change with geography.<br />Actually, I believe that V.H. sat and pontificated with his pen about the superiority of the French people and all the bells and whistles that are associated with their history. That is perfectly fine, but I was more interested in Jean, Cossette, and Javert. I now realize why there was an abridged version to this book, and had I known then when I know now I would have picked that version up instead.<br />If this was V.H. first novel and he was not well known and just came in off the street, those editors would have tore his manuscript to pieces. I like continuity of a story, and this novel went off on too many tangents to where I felt cheated >:-(<br />My opinion as to why many people loved this book was because they were so enamored with the play and the story  that they already had a positive bias toward this book.<br /> Not one of my favorite classics...sorry to offend. The story was great, but the fat in between has to go.	2002-08-05

This story we are reintroduced to Pendergrast and Nora Kelly as well as Smithback the reporter, and they all have good chemistry. <BR>That, I loved about this book, however the plot was not that believable and I figured out who the killer was halfway through. But did I not like this book? I loved it, these guys should be the primer for how an action book should be written, they don't dottle on with too much dialogue or unnecessary information.  The descriptions of the past were top notch and the build up to the end was very well planned out. As always these guys never really leave any lose ends.

I guess it looked lonely on the shelf and I wanted to see what it was all about, and to my surprise this was actually an entertaining, yet semi-tough book to endure till around page 350. <BR>Early on W.S.M sets up Philip's life: where he started, and the underlying motivations and convictions that caused him to make the tragic decisions he ultimately does. In a nutshell, Philip is this orphan who is raised by his uncle and aunt a Vicar 60 miles from London. Philip is very unhappy, yet very impressionable at the same time. As Philips grows older we see how he will react to Religion, Management, Friends, the arts and his loves. It is not till Philip meets Mildred and begins to date her, that Maugham gives Philip free reign of the novel. It is from this point that Maugham makes Philip a pathetic predicable fool for love. I personally know many people, both male and female who went through exactly what Philip endured during the beginning of his relationship. Maughams dialogue was so raw that I was cringing when they argued. <BR>It is in my opinion that many people who wrote prior reviews, had a hard time with this book because either they were on the receiving or giving end of this very neurotic love affair themselves and it instilled in them the same feelings of anguish. <BR>But ultimately what I got from this novel, was that life is not perfect. There are alot of directions we could take life, and sometimes we have to do what we want to do, even if our piers are dead set against it. Yet we must throw caution into the wind and see if our decisions are the right choice. We must learn from our mistakes, we must get lost before we can find ourselves.	2002-06-17

However I just finished #4 and I must be honest. I found this book subpar with the others, the story meandered and was a tad slow. I thought that J.K.R was having trouble coming up with a story and decided to spew forth an edition that could have been shortened by about 200 pages. Now I love to read fluff books as much as the next guy however, I was finding this book too long for all intents and purposes. I mean can you watch a 3 hour movie of the Power puff girls before you say, \\"jeez this is a tad long.\\" Remember, J.K. think of the little kids who are reading this book.

I loved his writing style: quick, witty and easy to follow. The action just kept on coming, and never let up. The story moved along at a brisk pace, yet had time to address sensitive emotional issues, which you would not expect from a horror novel. This book is full of characters from all walks of life and amazingly they were all pretty well developed, even the ones that made the smallest contributions. I highly recommend this book for the beach. Just don't expect a deep read, this is not Byron but I think you know that already. I look forward to reading Swan Song in the future.	2002-05-24

I was impressed with his style of writing and the way he set up the mystery and characters. Yes! This book dealt with gay themes, but that was not it was all about. The author gave 3 dimensions to all the characters, both big and small. The dialogue was a bit hokey, but hey he's young and he'll get better. However after awhile it became tedious, with the violence and the dysfunctional family scenarios going over the top. In the end the book took on this great soap opera feel. It was at this point where I was a little disappointed. But again a good start to a blossoming career. <br />P.S.

A novel that won some kind of Award if I'm not mistaken. So I had high hopes but...to my chagrin it was a bit slow for my tastes. The action going on was just about NIL. If a little action was going on I would get so excited; I felt like a starving man receiving a crumb of stale bread. Also when the action did happen it ended so quickly and with out much to explain for it. What's up with that? Klein had a hard time coming to point with his characters.<BR>Also the Love story didn't pan out, and the characters just died off with so little drama or fanfare. Here Klein builds up their personalities with long passages and through anecdotes, then he up and kills them off with the same enthusiasm as some one turning a door knob. There were also too many unimportant details that were added, which I personally thought should have been excluded. <BR>Sad to say, as the book was nearing the last 10 pages there was a quick rap up, a forgetful ending, with nothing there to leave me with that felling of WOW. However I thought the novel's descriptions were top notch, but style still losses to content. <BR>T.E.D Klein I will say is one of the best descriptive writers around, I though his method for building up a character and or situation are painstakingly detailed and deliberate. He would start explaining a situation that we would have no idea where it is going, only to see it come to a convincing conclusion. That is all well and good, but I also need some plot to keep me going.<BR><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><<BR>Too many loose ends in this book T.E.D	2002-04-25

There was nothing redeeming about his Life. <BR>Cahill, the author did a wonderful job making his life story seem so real feeling as I read. <BR>I will say the first chapter was so gross, what with the describing the little red worms in the soil in the crawl space.

I won't explain the book, but it involves a poor unsuspecting soul, who doesn't know the whole story, but we soon see he will learn it one way or another as the group is slowingly dying. You'll see what I mean Wonderful, and fast paced.<BR>Thse authors are just great. But I think I mentioned that before.	2002-03-11

CRY TO HEAVEN is probably one of Anne Rice's best novels and one of the best novels I have ever read. Period! <br />I must admit, I didn't care for INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, it was slow and dragged a bit. But that was her first novel, I can see she's improved a lot since that time. <br />This novel was so beautifully written, the settings of 18th century Italy are magnificent. I could honestly imagine being there witnessing the sounds, colors and smells of the period. Her characters are so richly drawn, that I felt like I knew them personally. But above all, the plot is wonderful, a story of adventure, revenge and the struggle of personal identity. Not the mention a wonderful ending that had me glued. <br />Sadly, I've noticed that this book is always obscured by her Vampire and Witch novels. Personally I feel this book is better than those. So forget Vampires and Witches for once and try this not so well known gem. Ironically this novel has been out for 20 years and no one I ask has read it and some never even heard of it. A lot of my friends would say that they always see the book on the shelf but never had a desire to read it. So I guess the real reason I read it was because no one else has and I was curious to find out what was it all about. I'm glad I did, now it will be my little secret.	2002-03-06

I have read, and I must say he is one hell of a writer. The courage it takes to write about a paralyzed main character, and to make it believable in the process takes some imagination.<br />The plot of this book was very well laid out, there was no fat to add to the mix, just good solid fun. The murders by the killer were original. And the tight story line had me biting my nails to see who the next victim would be, and how they would ultimately display the next clue. I highly recommend this book.<br />Just an aside, the movie was good even with its weaker ending but nothing like the novel.	2002-03-01

As the victims start dying with the same symptoms, the CDC is called in to isolate and determine where the virus is originating from. A great mystery is laid out for us, and the man hunt was on with break neck speed. <BR> But, this is a scary book, for the fact that if you've never been to the NYC Subway system, you would have no idea how crowded it gets and how vulnerable we all are. Some would say, don't work or live in NYC if you are scared, but remember a terrorist will find an easier target where the world isn't watching...like your home town for instance. <BR>But I say hogwash, because if you believe that then the bad guys have won. But regardless this is a Good novel.	2002-03-01

This is without a doubt one of the best stories I have ever read. It is not a deep \\"make you think novel,\\" but Brain candy to the Nth degree. I loved the mystery and the adventure of the island setting, here we have booby traps, scuba diving, and treasure hunting. <BR>In a nutshell, a vast treasure was buried over 3 hundred years ago by a famous rogue pirate, but because of an ingenious architect, the ability to dig for the treasure was virtually impossible.<BR>Until we come to the 1990's. A modern treasure hunter, and his crew are after the treasure, and this time they are determined to get it at any cost, even if lives are at stake. Thats all I'll tell, but I promise you will not be disappointed. <BR>These two guys are some of the best writers around, keep the books coming.	2002-03-01

In fact I was downright bored. I'm not saying I won't read another one of his novels, but I'll ask around for a good one first, because if his other books are like this one, then DAMN. <BR>Now I read quiet a bit, and I love a good scary story from time to time. .... It starts off well, scary house in the woods...that hasn't been lived in for years. Yada Yada...you know the formula. Anyway half way through the book it takes a turn for the worst. No clear plot, or conclusion. Boring desriptions and characters you could care less for. <BR>I promise you, in a few years there will about 100 copies of this book on the used bookstore shelf in your town, because no one will want to hold onto it.

Which in the end helped me get to the end of this 700 page novel.   I was given this novel by my friend who just so happens to be a psychologist, but he never read it. So I was happy to accept a free hardback written by a well known author.   Well to my dismay,  I was kind of disappointed. For one thing this 700+ page novel only took place in 4 days, that is alot of pages for a short time frame. Also the actions were kind of boring and by the end Koontz was using the Matrix movie to add to his story. If you read the book you'll know what I mean, but the dialogue was witty,and this was what got me to the end. Sadly I thought Koontz had lost his touch after reading this book.   I later came across a news article with Koontz featured, in it he stated that while writing False Memory he had a severe writers block. You can easily see this is the case after you read this book. I think his editor needed to tighten up the story. If you what to see what this man is capable of then read WHISPERS or DARKFALL.	2002-03-01

I was total consumed by the gritty descriptions of the bombed out city of Stalingrad and the suffering of the Russian and German soldiers. David Robbins does a wonderful job of creating the smells and misery surrounding this horrible period in history. Basically the story pits two snipers, one Russian, the other German against each other. But what I liked most, was the character development that D.R. sets up for us. <BR>Both Snipers are total different in there outlook at life, they have a different style of hunting and there reasons for fighting are total different. But there bond is strong for they are good at one thing. I was up till all hours of the night waiting to see how it would turn out which was a tad quick. My only regret was that the book continued for additional 40 pages, which was more of a history lesson rather than a suspense novel. But worth the time if you like war novels.	2002-02-27

I was hoping for a cross between \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" and \\"The Great Escape.\\" Well I was kind of right on both counts. <BR>King Rat is an authentic novel written from Clavell's past experiences in a Japanese prison camp during the war. <BR>In a nutshell, we have an American, called The King who, back in America was as plain as dirt and who came from humble beginnings. Well ironically, while in Prison, his rough upbringing was just the thing that made him a survivor/local hero among the other enlisted men, yet among the educated British officers he was a trouble maker who wouldn't conform to the rules of the prison. To the Rat prison was the best thing that ever happened to him.<BR>Clavell, spent very little time on the Japanese. This novel dealt mainly with the interactions of the prisoners. <BR>Rather that a prison/war novel I felt this was more or less a character study of class systems. King Rat illustrates to us that a down and out loser from America who couldn't get arrested before the war, can become the most important and cunning survivor during the war. Because, when it is the comes down to it, this is the rule of the jungle, dog eat dog . Just like the actual rat, we loathe them, we try to kill as many as we can, yet we can never seem to kill them all, because a rat is a survivor and can adapt to its surroundings. So in short, the Rat was King in this jungle. <BR>Fine novel, I recommend it.	2002-02-26

I have read everything these guys have ever written and I think this is one of the best to date. I loved the adventure, mixed with the technical explainations. These guys, have a formula that works and are smart not to ruin a good thing by staying on the mark. These guys always have a story where you have to read on to see what the hell the mystery is, then how will they solve it. Listen people this book is great, what more can I tell you. Unless you find traveling down to the tip of South America, digging up a meteor weighing as much as 5 Efial Towers, that harnesses a power that can't be explained, while being chased down by a rouge sea captain armed with a destroyer, against the back drop of the Antartic Ocean's black icy waters BORING.

And what I discovered was a novel of \\"grotesque beauty.\\" Mr. Grass Paints a portrait of Danzig Germany before and after the Third Reich, and he does it with tremendous skill. I have never read a book where the details of the grotesque made me shiver. I'm talking about the \\"horse's head scene.\\" Anyway, here we have Oscar, a boy who never grows in size, but his brain and intellect excells. I like to think Of Oscar as the fly on the wall. Grass uses a child someone who is the center of attention yet no one notices. I won't go into detail about the novel, I think enough reviews before me did that, but I hope that if you do read it you will look for those same nuances that I noticed. It is really a facinating work of fiction, very ahead of it's time. Just a warning...if you should rent the film, it will only go as far as the end of the War.	2002-02-22

While in the elevator traveling down to the lobby a man was standing in front of me. Turns out this was Peter Straub. He was plugging his new book Hell Fire Club, He turned out to be a very nice guy. So I feel a personal bond while I read his bookS if you can believe that. <BR>I first read this book in 1986, I thought it was a little confusing, but being as young as I was (14) I finished it. I figured it must be my immaturity, that I didn't follow the story well. So jump ahead to 2000, I just happen to come across my dusty Hard cover that I had and decided to give it a retry. Now I am almost 30 and I feel I have some comprehention of things so I read it over. Well I was right, the premis of the book is great, it's just that Straub was having a hard time putting it into words. The book was too long and wordy with too many unimportant charactors we didn't need to hear about. I found the main charactors very 3 dimensional, as well as the description of the town, but the story runs along at a bumpy pace. It's not a lite read at all. You'll need to put your thinking caps on for this one. But Straub is not a King or Koontz more like Henry James. Now on a positive note; mind you Floating Dragon is not a great book, but Straub is a great author. <BR>Straub to me is a literary Horror writer, he doesn't write fast books with happy endings. His books make you think and contemplate. He is in a genre of his own.	2002-02-22

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Barker on two separate occasions, and I found him to be quite charming; considering the type of stories he writes, (blood and gore,)you would never have expected him to be that way. <BR>This happens to be my 3rd Barker book and I found it to be the best, however it wasn't very good. I think Mr. Barker has good intentions, but I feel his antagonists to be gruesomely silly. I feel as though the story, meanders a bit then he will throw in a bit of gore so you won't get board. <BR>Now don't get me wrong there were moments where I couldn't wait to see what happened next, then when something finally does happen; I then couldn't wait to get it over with. He is ok, but I still like Stephen King, Peter Straub, Anne Rice &amp; Dean Koontz better. <BR>Now I will still read his books, because I like the plots on the jackets, and I respect him for being a regular guy in person and not a stuck up celebrity.	2002-02-19

I find his writing tedious and decriptive to a fault. I have no problem with description, but it ended up being a history lesson rather than a adventure story. I wanted the story to move along, but it kept getting bogged down with politics of various subjects. Now I'm sure there are a few out there who think that EVL is too deep for most, but I disagree, in the course of the book there were numerous [personal]scenes which  are so graphic.<BR>I guess EVL was told by his editor to add them in order to sell a few more copies. Don't waist your time folks. In Lustbader's defense, I must admit the story is very well thought out and complex, but I think EVL should of told it to a person who could have put it down on paper better. Clancy and Ludlum don't need [intercourse] scenes to sell books. It would be ok to describe one in detail then mention; they went to bed and then woke up, but not go into such detail for every encounter beacuse we get the point. EVL had about 5 of them,to add his creativity to. I have no problem with [personal] scenes. But I can read [other publishings]for that, here I just want a good story...	2002-02-19

I was hoping there was (not to sound shallow) a little more \\"action.\\" But it turned, out to be more of a humanistic and political look at the underpinnings of Israeli's fight for independence. And I must admit, I did enjoy the story and learned alot about the Israeli people in the process. I am neither pro-Arab nor pro-Israeli, but I do have a new found sympathy and respect for the Israeli people after reading this novel. Yes, I know the history of Israel, but I feel as though I now have names and faces to put to that history. I'm can honestly say I'm proud of the Jews who fought their hearts out, while the non-Jewish world quietly hoped they failed. It is sad to say that it took 3 wars, just to get some respect from the Americans.

Uris tells the tale of how the 2 winning sides of the war will divy up the country of Germany. The beginning is pretty straight forward, but Uris quickly shows how the Soviets are trying to play mind games with the Americans. We are shown how the two opposing sides deal with their territories won in battle. We see how the Americans fix the pipes and sewage systems and are shown how the eastern Germans are treated like dogs from the Russians. While all is going on we are shown how the Cold War takes shape. Great story telling, and great charactors add to the mix. At some points he had me cheering, when the USA was pitted against the USSR. The section where the huge airlift operation took place was terrific story telling. <BR> The complex nature of the book's charators, goes to show that Uris, is among the elite writers of his day.

In this book, Michener describes the landscape and the people who make up Afghanistan during the 1940's. Read this book If you would like to learn about the landscape of Kabul, and what the country was like in appearance.<BR> What I found interesting was that Michener, wrote of the Afgan people. He considered them as brutal, crude and indifferent to change. Yet one of the main Afgan characters keeps explaining that his country will be modernized and come to it's own someday...providing that there be enough well educated Afgans to establish law an order. <br /> Unfortunately, since the Rule of the Teliban Afganistan has sadly reversed itself from 1944, but 1844, in both its laws and tolerance to change. No TV, Radio...Even CHESS OR CHECKERS are not permitted. Amazingly, the way Michener wrote of Afghanistan then, is the way it is again. So to read this book and to see the News reels on TV create an understanding I feel a personal bond with. Michener, must of had a crystal ball, because he predicted the Communists coming to rule. But it is on page 212 of the paperback edition, where Michener wrote.<br />\\"Our major cities have been destroyed so many Do you know what<BR> I expect...Seriously? When a thousand men like me have rebuilt Kabul and made it as great as The City once was, either the Russians or the Americans will come with there airplanes and bomb it to rubble.\\" <br />WOW!	2001-11-08
