The premise of this book ultimately throws me.  <br /> <br />Is \\"Like a Rolling Stone'' supposed to be the seminal song of rock and roll? Of Dylan's career? Of the 60s? To me, it's none of the above. Why not something on the Dead's \\"Dire Wolf?'' At least Robert Hunter acknowledged that he and Garcia didn't know that the prehistoric animal they chornicled was more like a medium-sized dog than \\"400 pounds of sin.'' Dylan acknolwedges nothing here. <br /> <br />I've always been a fan of Dylan but this didn't floor me when it came out. I noted it was long for a single, but so what? Everything was changing in those days. In fact, if I had to rank Dylan stuff from that era, it probably wouldn't be in my top 10. I found \\"Positively Fourth Street'' more interesting. And \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues'' may have had more impact _ it was an early example of what's turned into rap and hip-hop; the Weathermen took their name from it, and it's certainly influenced other songwriters, most recently Rodney Crowell. <br /> <br />Yes, there are interesting anecdotes here and Marcus' rundown of the top 10 over a period of weeks in 1965 illustrates how stale radio is these days _ the variety of styles and genres that were played then would be remarkable today. <br /> <br />But the book ultimately is just another example of the kind of criticism that drives me nuts and, I suspect, would make Dylan laugh. Rock critics, without access to the mind of the performer, viewed songs through their own prism, sometimes honed by college professors who just KNEW what writers from Hemingway to Joyce were thinking. So the critics KNEW what Dylan was thinking. In the end, I'm not even sure Bob knew. A sidelight: read Levon Helm's autobiography to note the different interpretations even within The Band of what \\"The Weight'' was about  _ Robbie Robertson pretentiously suggests that it's symbolic stuff gleaned from Rimbaud and other offbeat poets in vogue in those days. Levon says \\"Rode into Nazareth'' isnothing more than a recollection of a drive to Nazareth, Pa., where the Martin guitar factory is located. And \\"Annie'' is a childhood friend of Helm's. <br /> <br />That's a different song and a different Band, linked, of course, to Dylan. Come to think of it, I like that song much better too. Maybe \\"Rolling Stone'' was an epiphany to Marcus; to me it's just a song. <br /> <br />As Mick Jagger said after the Stones performed it, \\"Thank you Bob.'' (Yes, it could have been a tribute to Mick and the lads) <br /> <br />For this book, no thanks.  <br /> <br />	2005-07-14

Now I'm here and I found out: the ghost writer quit. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'll finish, although I know evil will be vanquished even though I'm not sure good will be served. Everyone else has said it: this is preachy, stagnant and filled with mistakes from the major to the mundane. It doesn't take two hours to get from Manhattan to Rockland Coung. More like 45 minutes. And Mount Vernon is not a wealthy suburb of New York but a very middle-class, integrated and, in some sections, downright poor. But there's worse to go with the cardboard characters and about a half book of past history and the psyche of the Karp/Ciampi famil.

Maybe I should blame Peter Gethers, who's listed as the editor.<br />Things that drove me nuts:<br />1. Purple Heart. Two characters win purple hearts, which Diehl seems to equate with a silver star. Doesn't anyone there know anything about the military? You get a purple heart if you sprain an ankle falling out of a jeep in a war zone. Once, I can take the heroic reference to purple hearts, but they keep recurring. <br />2. Anachronisms. <BR>   -LP records in 1941. Forget it.<BR>   - A \\"pants suit'' on a woman in the same year. That term didn't come into vogue until at least the 60s and women just didn't wear them then. Slacks, yes. Suits no.<BR>   _ Someone gets news from AP and UPI. In 1941, it was AP, UP and International News Service. UP and INS merged in the 50s to make UPI.<BR>   _ A storm coming up at sea in late May in Southern California. It happens maybe once a century. There's an old song \\"It Never Rains in Southern California'' that's not quite true. But the rainy season is late October to late April. Not late May. (Although I once remember a few drops in August in the San Francisco Bay Area.)<br />Overall, this is a good read and it's well plotted, although a few things aren't hard to spot ahead of time. But the mistakes (and there are others) started driving me nuts. One blurb on the back compares Diehl to Hammett and Ellroy. Forget it. He should have read them to get the mood right.	2003-05-25

I'm not a huge FBI fan, but the way Child has it violate Reacher's rights is beyond anything it would (or could) do. And give us a break: let the guy take a shower and a nap and change his clothes while traveling without sleep from East Coast to West and back again about four times in a week.<br /> Finally, the book also contains the kind of minor mistakes that add up to strained credibility. You do not take the Palisades Parkway to the Garden state. They run parallel. And Fort Dix is not a Marine base. It's Army, unless it's changed since I served there in the '60s.

The same can be said of the other characters in this readable and satisfying book that, among other things, suggests that you can't tell a person by his politics.<br /> Example: Inspector Burgess, the mean and sometimes mean-spirited visitor from London suspects reds under every bed, left-wing conspiracies behind everything and yet ... likes Billie Holiday. Osmond, who seems a knee-jerk left-winger, talks about the way all anti-nuclear people  are presumed to be on the same page on every subject. They're not, he notes, pointing to the anti-abortion position of some left-wing Catholics.<br />All of this humanizes an interesting detective story.

I understand the awakening the woman from Virginia had after hearing one version of the Civil War all her life. But that is counterbalanced by two major problems and a lot of minor ones:<br /> 1. Is Winik's thesis correct? Was America &quot;saved'' by April, 1965? A lot of historians argue that Lincoln's assassination let Congress unleash its wrath on the South rather than reconstruct gently, an error that we're still trying to rectify. OK, school segregation is no longer legal, although it exists, and African-Americans can vote, get elected to office and use the same bathrooms and drinking fountains as whites. But 136 years later, we're still having debates over the display of the Confederate flag. And the problem is national, not southern. Maybe we wouldn't have been better off had Lincoln lived. But maybe we would have.<br />2. Nobody (actually too many people) edited this book. Others have pointed out typos and two Longstreets. My problem is digression. The background on Lee and others has been covered by McPherson (seemingly Winik's mentor), Foote, Catton and dozens of others, most of them more accurately. Michael Shaara captured Lee better and more movingly in a novel, &quot;The Killer Angels,'' than Winik does here.<br />  Some of the anectodal digressions are revealing but others are pedantic or patronizing. There's one about the Confederate armies marching on foot, which, Winik tells us, is something we 20-21st century types might not understand. Modern armies, you see, use tanks, trucks, helicopters and planes. Except, of course, for the Bataan death march.<br />Never would have known that.<br /> There are plenty of fascinating nuggets in the anecdotes. But is this a defining Civil War book? Hardly. It reads more like something that sprang from a discussion at a dinner party inside the Beltway. It's an interesting theory. Nothing more.	2001-05-11

He takes a premise, makes it his title, then tries to link it together through five administrations and their different problems. Of course, the special prosecutor is a result of  Watergate, but each of the special prosecutors were different, each case  was different and it took Ken Starr's abuse of power to demonstrate that  Antonin Scalia (of all people) was right in his dissent in the decision  that upheld the law.<br />But back to Woodward. He revels in inside stuff, in  reporting EVERYTHING that everybody said to everybody else. Some of it is  ego _ if he and his helpers interview 1,000 people, then everything they  say is in the book. If someone prominent doesn't want to be interviewed,  like George Bush, then Woodward runs his &quot;Dear Bob'' letter telling  why. This country and journalism owe a debt to Woodward for Watergate. But  what he's written since is stuff that can't find the forest for the trees.  He substitutes anecdotes for summary judgement, which is where he fails  most. When Bush writes to Woodward that he's tired of the personal  dirt-digging, he's identifying the biggest problem in politics in the last  two decades. I don't agree with Bush's politics, but I agree with him on  what politics has become. Woodward's book is an example _ Watergate and  Iran-Contra are public policy gone amuck. Monica is personal standards gone  amuck. There's a big difference and Woodward knows it. But instead of  telling us, he uses anecdote and gossip about all of it.<br />It's a shame.  This could have been a book summarazing American politics in the last  quarter-century. Instead, it's an overreported mishmash.	1999-07-06

My father, a Communist sympathizer (who knew  Horowitz' parents) ended up the same way when he became aware in 1955 of  Stalin's brutalities and when he saw people (like Horowitz' parents) shun  those who strayed from the party line. What Horowitz needs is perspective.  He didn't get it from his parents and he didn't have it in the 60s.	1999-06-10

But this was so muddled and incredible that it was a diversion trying to read it. Push-button characters. leaden words and a ridiculous &quot;plot.''

(I've done with Grisham, too, so I suppose that augurs well for O'Reilly. The basic problem  is that he can't write. And yeah, the TV business is cutthroat, but we  already know that. So ... wooden characters, wooden writing, a wooden  (paperback) book.	1999-05-02
US	52993242	R3QNTZSUFQNDXM	034542624X	763358805	Hart's War	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	What a popular novel should be	Looking at the raves, you'd think this is War and Peace. It's not. But it's a great read and it poses enough moral dilemmas to make those people who just like a breezy plot (like Grisham) to use their minds a little.  Yes, there are a few carboard chartacters _ the good German Fritz  and the  evil Nazi; the British barrister and the hockey-playing Canadian cop. But  this isn't a perfect book, just a good one with a lot of nice points, like  the fact that war heroes aren't sometimes a bit unwavory when they have no  sanctioned war to fight. Katzenbach has always been uneven _ some quite  good novels and some quite bad ones.  Maybe we should credit this turn to  his father (read the afterword). I gather that Katzenbach has wanted to  make his own name rather than bask in his father's, who was attorney  general under Johnson  (Tommy Hart seems to come out pretty close to that).  But it's clear he is awed by his dad's wartime experience.. One addendum:  Is Denzel Washington too old to star with Tom Cruise in the movie? I'd  rather see Andre Braugher.  But Denzel sells tickets	1999-04-26

This indeed is Poor Boy Makes Bad.  I've  read this a half-dozen times and I can't find many flaws other than  the occasionally murky prose and my prediliction for visualizing the  protagonists as  Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters and  even Raymond Burr in his cameo as the prosecutor. A wonderful book.	1999-03-30

He's not. The model works for an outfit very much like IMG, known in the  business as &quot;I Am Greedy.'' Yes, Rosenhaus is a shark, who cares  little for his clients.

Now that he's becoming un-tortured (even without a wife),  Harry seems a more balanced and focused character.  Unlike some other  critics, I don't mind the  racial themes. Rodney King did happen and   relations between cops and minorities aren't exactly wonderful, in LA, in  New York and most other major cities. I even liked Connolly's little  self-promotions, like the ad for a movie called &quot;Bloodworks'' with  Clint Eastwood. I'm not up on inside Hollywood stuff, but I guess something  like that is on the horizon.	1999-03-09

But I had to suspend my credibility every page. As one reviewer pointed out, there's no such thing as &quot;shoot to kill'' and &quot;shoot to wound.'' There's also no  way anyone, even the military, would engage in such obvious deception  without someone blowing the whistle. The surprise twist at the end? It was  telegraphed pretty early. Oh well, it's still a good book for a plane ride.	1999-02-23

Hunter's far too good to fall into that trap, but he does. There's far too  much technobabble, too many boring discussions of calibers and gun sights,  and most of all, too much stalking through the jungles and the  mountains.<br />Too bad, because the plotline is good and the insight into the  hangover from Vietnam is right on. But developing the plot, which hangs  together from 1971 to 1997 would be far better than spending half the book  on snipers stalking others and themselves.<br />Maybe Hunter has ended the  Swagger saga and has something new in mind. If so, I'll be there. But  please, in English not in calibers.	1998-08-23

Yes, Nissans and Toyotas are Japanese, but Hyundais aren't and Hunter annoyed me each time the mistake was repeated. Maybe even his gun stuff is off, although I wouldn't know _ I'm not an NRA member.<br />Nonetheless, Hunter has one talent that most thriller writers don't _ he can write. This is the second I've read (I'm reading his trilogy backwards). I'm not generally a reader of macho adventure stuff, but this is above the genre. Hunter beautifully develops character, like Pewtie's ambivalence about his marriage and his family, and he even develops a bit of sympathy for the sociopathological bad guys _ at least two of them (Lamar is a bit too much).<br />But please, just a little better on facts. Like Hunter, I'm a journalist, and the first rule that's drilled into us is getting them right.	1998-07-06

It wasn't bad but it was pedestrian, an illustration that Jeff Shaara clearly wasn't his father. The Last Full Measure changes my mind.<br />No, it's not Michael Shaara's &quot;The Killer Angels'' _ very few books are_ but it's hardly pedestrian.     And its central theme is far darker _ that war is about killing. Sherman (&quot;War is Hell'') got it right and was instantly misunderstood. Sherman's total war was an effort to win quickly by destroying everything around him,anticipating all too well the next century's horrors.<br />What Jeff Shaara captures here is the same sentiment in Lincoln and Grant, who realized by 1864 that the more men killed on both sides, the more quickly the North would win because of its manpower advantage. It's rarely presented that way,  perhaps because history has so mythologized Lincoln that to state it might tarnish his image. Shaara doesn't overstate the philosophy, instead simply puts it in Grant's thoughts.      Finally, Shaara captures the personal links his father used so well. In fact, he may do it better _ one of the few weak spots in &quot;The Killer Angels'' is the oversentimental Armistead-Hancock relationship. In this case, it's there in the prewar friendship between Grant and Longstreet, the reminisences between Grant and Hancock and the thoughts of Lee on the abilities of George Thomas and of Grant and Lee on John Bell Hood.     There are weak spots. Except in the scene before Petersburg in which he's used to demonstrate the ineptness of Meade's chain of comman, he has little use. He's there, I suspect, because he was the central character in The Killer Angels. If Shaara's trying to balance the professional soldiers (Grant and Lee) against the volunteer, it doesn't quite come off. <br />But this is a solid, solid effort, far better than Gods and Generals and not too far from Michael Shaara's masterpiece, which is probably the best piece of fiction written on any war.	1998-06-29

I didn't like the Alienist and this is far worse _ 747 pages in paperback. OK, give Carr a star for knowing about turn of the century New York (although who knows if that's accurate _ i wasn't there.)<br />But the characters are cardboard (1990s politically correct as one of your reviewers noted). Good African-Americans, feminists, street urchins and horses, plus a drunken newspaperman with a heart of gold and a screwy shrink. Fine, but they're cardboard cutouts with little depth. Carr even adheres (in both books) to the myth of Teddy Roosevelt, not the reality. (If they had TV spots for politicians in his day, Carr could have gotten a job writing them.<br />But I'm getting almost as long as Carr. There are a lot better in the mystery genre _ from Alan Furst to James Ellroy and Katherine Kijewski. Try them and leave Carr in 1897.	1998-06-23

Overall, it's an interesting read if you don't take the characters too seriously. One example: a Jewish doctor in 14th century Spain suffers all sorts of indignities for his faith, yet gives it up with little remorse for the love of a fair English maid. At least give him a little Jewish guilt ...<br />If you want to read about a plague, try Stephen King's &quot;The Stand.'' King's 1,300 pages are effortless; Benson's 650 are tortured and should be no more than 400.	1998-06-18

Instead it was simply an interesting angle in a decent whodunit in which the who was a little too evident.<br />On second thought, why not male on male fantasies.

This would be an easy 10 if someone else wrote it _ there are no bad Irving books, only good and better. But this one lacks the unity of &quot;A Prayer for Owen Meany'' or the Garp-like farce of &quot;A Son of the Circus.''<br />Still, only Irving can pull off this kind of novel _ a tragedy leavened by dozens of comic moments. Nor can anyone else draw characters like Irving _ You can see the 16-year-old Eddie O'Hare in the 53-year-old who closes the book living in a house where he's awakened four times a night by the Long Island Railroad. The flaws? I'm not a fan of books within books and Hannah's a bit of a cliche. Overall _ for someone else, this is a 10. For Irving, just an 8.	1998-05-12
