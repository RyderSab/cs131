Athos to visit the many monasteries there and they come upon a Father Makarios. They muse on the ego, separation from God, etc., and when it is time to go, the good Father says, [\\"Good luck. God be with you.\\" And a moment later, mockingly: \\"Regards to the world.\\" \\"Regards to heaven,\\" I retorted. \\"And tell God it's not our fault but his-because He made the world so beautiful.\\"] (p 225)<br /><br />On a trip to Jerusalem they meet a young man who [\\"...was passionately condemning  the dishonesty and injustice of present-day economic and social life. The masses went hungry while the great and powerful piled up fortunes. Women sold themselves, priest did not believe, both heaven and the infernal pit were here on earth. The afterlife did not exist; here was where we had to find justice and happiness.... Cries rang out: \\"Yes, yes, you're right!\\" \\"Fire and axe!\\" Only one person attempted to object.\\" ...\\"It was frightening. The purpose of trip was to worship the sweet, familiar face of God-so gentle, so tortured, so filled with hopes for life everlasting.\\" ...\\"...we were carrying as a terrifying gift  the seed of a new, dangerous, and as yet unformed cosmogony.\\"] (p 245)<br /><br />Later and on the road to the Dead Sea, \\"I had found it necessary to purge my bowels and expel the demons inside me-wolves, monkeys, women; minor virtues, minor joys, successes-so that I could remain simply an upright flame directed toward heaven. Now that I was a man, what was I doing but enacting what I had so ardently desired as a child in the courtyard of our family home! A person is only born once; I would never have another chance!\\" (p 252)<br /><br />*Kazantzakis begins to summarize his spiritual journey with, \\"Our journey to the fatal intellectual Golgotha thus becomes more loaded with responsibility because now, looking at the Cretans, we know that if we fail to become human, the fault is ours, ours alone. For this lofty species-man-exists, he made his appearance on earth, and there is no longer any justification whatever for our deterioration and cowardice.\\" (p 441)*<br /><br />At the end is, \\"Just then-as fate was in a mood to play games-I made the acquaintance of an elderly mineworker named Alexis Zorba.\\" (Zorba the Greek). This leads Kazantzakis to an introductory chapter on Zorba wherein he states, \\"My life's greatest benefactors have been journeys and dreams. Very few people, living or dead, have aided my struggle. If, however, I wished to designate which people left their traces imbedded most deeply in my soul, I would perhaps designate Homer, Buddha, Nietzsche, Bergson, and Zorba.\\"<br /><br />(p 445)<br /><br />Kazantzakis was a prolific writer with incredible insight and wisdom and some of his best known works are: \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" and \\"Zorba the Greek\\". Start in on any book, though, and one will most likely feel compelled to read them all!<br />*Kazantzakis begins to summarize his spiritual journey with, \\"Our journey to the fatal intellectual Golgotha thus becomes more loaded with responsibility because now, looking at the Cretans, we know that if we fail to become human, the fault is ours, ours alone.

Will we put this knowledge to use in time?<br /><br />So what exactly is \\"Future Shock\\"? Toffler explains: \\"We may define future shock as the distress, both physical and psychological, that arises from an overload of the human organism's physical adaptive systems and it's decision-making processes. Put more simply, future shock is the human response to over-stimulation\\". Overload= breakdown! The socio-political, economic and environmental bills are coming due and they WILL be paid, shocking or not!<br /><br />Toffler sees that our time consuming, stressed-out, hyper-industrial, compulsive consuming society is leaving parents no time for proper child rearing- as if they were qualified for the task in the first place. Un-guided, un-taught, un-disciplined children set themselves and society up for another of the many aspects of future shock with their aberrant behavior expanding as they get older.<br /><br />\\"We don't let just anyone perform brain surgery or for that matter, sell stocks and bonds. Even the lowest ranking civil servant is required to pass tests proving competence. Yet we allow virtually anyone, almost without regard for mental or moral qualifications to try his or her hand at raising young human beings, so long as these humans are biological off-spring. Despite the increasing complexity of the task, parenthood remains the *greatest single preserve of the amateur*.\\"<br /><br />Toffler suggests that society should \\"professionalize\\" child rearing and parents should be educated by mandate of society. That along with every other level of society for a literate, more successful society. Guidelines for instituting \\"appropriate technology\\" vs. irresponsible, runaway  technology are covered. \\"Utopian\\" models for society should always be considered as guidelines for future adjustments and upgrades to consider- and think-tanks for that very purpose should be established. This along with \\"sanctuaries for social imagination\\"- sounds like ancient Greece, eh?<br /><br />Ten years after this book was published, Marilyn Ferguson came out with her block-buster book, \\"The Aquarian Conspiracy\\". She somewhat took-up where Toffler left off and created a blueprint of where we are and where we should be heading to stave-off the trauma of future shock. She expertly delineates the \\"Paradigm Shift\\" or changes needed in our collective thinking and proffers an abundance of guidelines and resources for that objective.<br /><br />The following year (1981), Duane Elgin comes out with his \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\", more guidelines for transitioning to a more harmonious existence. Elgin follows this with another similar book to \\"Future Shock\\" and \\"The Aquarian Conspiracy\\" with \\"Awakening Earth\\" (1993), then followed by \\"Promise Ahead\\"- a continuation of the paradigm shift of collective consciousness needed for survival into the future.<br /><br />To all of these fine books, one should add Theodore Roszak's \\"The Voice of the Earth\\" and we then have a small, but potent collection of some of the most instructive and helpfulbooks ever published for the immediate betterment of our existence on Earth. Excellent \\"How-to\\" manuals on global change in human perception of reality.ce on Earth. Excellent \\"How-to\\" manuals on global change in human perception of reality.	2005-05-15

As can be seen by a few negative reviews amongst the mostly glowing ones, the title is misleading and there is no \\"conspiracy\\" within the pages of this most uplifting and informing book.<br /><br />For those folks preoccupied with discovering where the devil lurks instead of seeking knowledge of God and truth, you will be disappointed because the devil ain't here. You would be well informed to ignore the title and dive in to the content.<br /><br />If your concern for life is such that you seek answers to some of the most confounding problems facing humanity, however, you will be delighted. No offense to Ms Ferguson or her publisher, but the title was poorly chosen and does not fit the beautiful content, but that's water under the bridge now. The assessment of the human condition along with the positive answers for unification of the human family with the rest of life is inspiring!<br /><br />That said, this beautiful book exploded on the scene in 1980 and described where humanity was at in it's perception of reality, social structure, economics, politics and environment. It also clearly delineated where we should be headed for a more inclusive, rewarding and healthy future and almost every chapter concludes with a comparison list to show where a \\"Paradigm Shift\\" or change, is needed in our collective perception of reality on a broad range of topics.<br /><br />The information and resources are as relevant today as when the book was first published- only more urgent because a good number of the changes needed then have not occurred and time marches on waiting for no one. Written as a \\"Why\\" and \\"How-to\\" guide for personal and societal transformation, it has an appendix full of network groups that offer guidance for change- all that list needs now is e-mail and website updates not available in 1980.<br /><br />To point out the relevancy of this work in today's world, we can take a look at a subject heading: \\"The Way Of Avoidance\\" (p 74). Consider all of the big ticket issues that are intentionally being swept aside and ignored by society and government alike such as global warming, population pressure, pollution, disparity of  wealth, etc.,  and we have:<br /><br />\\"At the level of ordinary consciousness, we deny pain and paradox. We doctor them with Valium, dull them with alcohol, or distract them with television. Denial is a way of life. More accurately, it is a way of diminishing life, of making it seem more manageable. Denial is the alternative to transformation.\\"<br /><br />\\"Personal denial, mutual denial, collective denial. Denial of facts and feelings. Denial of experience, a deliberate forgetting what we see and hear. Denial of our capacities. Politicians deny problems, parents deny their vulnerability, teachers deny their biases, children deny their intentions. Most of all, we deny what we know in our bones.\\"<br /><br />\\"We are caught between two different evolutionary mechanisms: denial and transformation.\\" And this is the essence of this fine book: to point out the current states of denial and to offer realistic, immediate alternatives for a positive transformation  to an existence that we would rather have and can obtain with a little effort.<br /><br />This book is a predecessor and now a fine companion to Duane Elgin's books, \\"Awakening Earth\\" \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\" and \\"Promise Ahead\\" where the need for \\"Paradigm Shifts\\" in thinking and relating to our world are expertly and thoroughly expounded upon.

This no-holds barred expose' demonstrates that the American fast food industry is no less than predatory and much of that aggressiveness was first brought out by Ray Croc, a ruthless businessman who had no problems in trying to ruin anyone who got in his way including the original founders of  McDonald's, Richard and Maurice \\"Mac\\" McDonald from whom Croc ultimately rested control of the company.<br /><br />All through the book are explanations of the selfish, ruthless, and abusive business techniques that big fast food chains torment their franchise owners with and on down the pecking order to the lowest employee level.<br /><br />The huge volume of sales from the combined number of fast food business' requires a huge amount of raw resources, most importantly to this basically carnivore industry, is the mass assembly-line production of meat products. The conditions for raising meat on the level of vast consumer consumption, reminds one of the deplorable conditions depicted in Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\", only with the modern addition of dangerous chemicals injected into cattle such as antibiotics and growth hormones that pass from the meat right into the consumer.<br /><br />Wonder now why American's are bloating-up and antibiotics are becoming useless against disease?<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone concerned with labor rights, health issues, and environmental damage done by this monster of a resource devouring industry.er of a resource devouring industry.	2005-05-13

The book we've been waiting for these many years! The Uncle Tom's Cabin of wage slavery! Comrade Sinclair's book, The Jungle! And what Uncle Tom's Cabin did for black slaves, The Jungle has a large chance to do for the white slaves...\\" and, \\"It is alive and warm. it is brutal with life. It is written of sweat and blood, and groans and tears. It depicts, not what man ought to be, but what man is compelled to be in this, our world, in the Twentieth Century...\\". (From Sinclair's 1946 republication Intro). A fitting summation from a fellow humanist.<br /><br />Upton Sinclair (1878-1968) was a tireless agitator for the rights of the working class and immigrants of America and a good part of his literary talents were dedicated to exposing the deplorable working conditions and labor abuse rampant in the early 20th century. \\"The Jungle\\" had one of the most profound effects on society of any novel ever written in it's time. With it's stomach turning expose' of the filthy conditions of the Chicago meat processing industry, it put a serious dent in the sale of meat for decades after and it also lead to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.<br /><br />Sinclair helped establish the League for Industrial Democracy and started the California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.<br /><br />To get a feel for the background in \\"The Jungle\\", Sinclair immersed himself in the Chicago industrial areas and living quarters and interviewed a broad spectrum of immigrants, stock-yard workers, slaughter-house workers, meat packing business owners, political figures, etc., so when his scathing expose' was published, he had done his homework and all of his facts were irrefutable- a good thing, for it caused an unprecedented uproar and protestations from the meat industry.<br /><br />The story follows a typical immigrant, \\"Jurgis Rudkus\\", from his entrance to the U.S. and his eventual migration towards the meat industry in Chicago. His trials and tribulations are detailed in an agonizing, but gripping tale of survival in his new country. Overtones of the deplorable working conditions for immigrants in New York City exposed by the famous women's advocate and nurse, Margaret Sanger, are very apparent.<br /><br />Although \\"The Jungle\\" has been a favorite of school teachers and their students for  a century now, this is a book that should be on a nationally required reading list for all graduate courses.<br /><br />The current \\"Jungle\\" type expose' is Eric Schlosser's \\"Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal\\" (2002), another scathing indictment of not only the American fast food industry and it`s assembly-line meat production activities, but it's predatory business history as one of America's most ruthless industries.

His first intro to wild foods was due to his family's poverty when they lived in New Mexico. At 12 years old, Gibbons went out in the surrounding country-side to forage for edibles to help feed his family and a life-long love of wild food got off to a pragmatic start. One of his first discoveries was wild asparagus, hence the book title namesake.<br /><br />This book is lyrical, yet practical and covers a sizeable array of wild foods- location, preparation, uses, etc. Recipes are given all through the book as well as some medicinal use info. One of Gibbons' favorite plants was the Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). He relates how the Dandelion has been one of humanities longest known and useful wild foods and medicines and laments the assault by lawn care chemical manufacturers in trying to demonize this beautiful, helpful gift from Nature.<br /><br />Gibbons traveled the world lecturing on the benefits of wild foods and was often seen on popular talk shows along with becoming a pitch-man for Post Grape Nut Cereal commercials where he treated America to hilarious daily line: \\"...taste like wild hickory nuts!\\".  Gibbon's came across like a modern-day cross between Mark Twain, Will Rogers and Henry David Thoreau.<br /><br />Those familiar with Thoreau's recently published last manuscript, \\"Wild Fruits\\" will see the close resemblance to \\"Stalking the Wild Asparagus\\"- both now classics and useful guides to Nature's cornucopia of wild edible gifts.	2005-05-12

Richard Feynman (1918-1988) had a very full and adventurous life as can be gleaned from this great book. The first half is mostly autobiographical and anecdotal and in the typical Feynman way, he leaves nothing to the imagination. He spent the latter part of his life as a Professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, Ca.<br /><br />For hobbies he loved bongos and drums and occasionally performed with a drumming group at Caltech, but was content to spend hours drumming with close friends such as Ralph Leighton at his home. Feynman also enjoyed drawing and painting and some of his artwork is depicted in this book. The artwork was exacting and professional. There are several photos covering Feynman's life and concluding with space shuttle photos and diagrams.<br /><br />The second half of the book, and some would say the most potent part, is dedicated to Feynman's participation in the investigation of the 1986 space shuttle \\"Challenger\\" accident. Feynman demonstrated the ultimate in dogged pursuit of the cause and was not to be intimidated or put-off by NASA and military officials who would have been happy not disclose the damning facts that they were thoroughly warned about safety issues before the launch, yet chose to ignore these warnings in deference to then  Pres. Reagan's desire for a political feather in his cap by launching the shuttle on his schedule.<br /><br />Who knows what, if anything, was explained to Reagan that the weather was too cold to launch (the shuttle was not suppose to be launched in less than 53 degree weather and the temperature at launch time was 29 degrees!). What is known is that the NASA management chose to ignore the warnings and heeded the beck and call of the President to launch. Later, and like typical management weasels, they tried to hush-up the fact that they were warned and then tried to blame the \\"O\\"-ring failure on the manufacturer, Thiokol.<br /><br />During the inquiry, Feyman took the opportunity to demonstrate a simple, common-sense experiment in front of his fellow investigative teammates and news cameras that when the \\"O\\"-rings are chilled (he dropped a piece of one held by pliers in a glass of ice-water) they shrink and cannot seal properly, and especially when the violent vibration of the launch process is added for an ultimately disastrous mix.<br /><br />If not for Feynman's persistence, this simple, but profound demonstration could have been swept under the rug and fingers unfairly pointed at Thiokol. Management refused to take any responsibility for the disaster, yet when in fact, their incompetent dismissal of the freeze conditions were what led to the disaster. Thank God for Richard Feynman! This is not only a fascinating look into Feynman's life, it is a national treasure, for here is where we see the bungling, politically motivated decisions of a great country being jerked around by bureaucrats leading, ultimately, to disaster.ple, common-sense experiment in front of his fellow investigative teammates and news cameras that when the \\"O\\"-rings are chilled (he dropped a piece of one held by pliers in a glass of ice-water) they shrink and cannot seal properly, and especially when the violent vibration of the launch process is added for an ultimately disastrous mix.

Garrett Hardin (1915-2003) was one of the world's greatest population, environmental resource scholars best known for his work, \\"The Tragedy of the Commons\\". This book is an educational population resource guide to a large cross-section of the world's greatest thinkers. A \\"who's who\\" in the human population forum.<br /><br />It is a beautiful compilation or \\"collage\\", if you will, of thoughts and essays, and papers from Malthus, Benjamin Franklin, Martin Luther, Raymond F. Dassman (\\"Environmental Conservation\\"), Paul Ehrlich (\\"Population, Resources\\"), Aristotle, Tennyson, Darwin, Thomas Huxley, Margaret Sanger, Robert Frost, and many, many more.<br /><br />A choice sample of what we find inside is a paper written by Alan Gregg in 1955, \\"A Medical Aspect of the Population Problem\\": \\"The destruction of forests, the annihilation or near extinction of various animals, and the soil erosion consequent to overgrazing illustrate the *cancerlike* effect that man-in mounting numbers and heedless arrogance-has had on other forms of life on what we call `our' planet\\". \\"Metastasis is the word used to describe another phenomenon of malignant growth...\\"<br /><br />This is a timeless tribute to Garrett Hardin and is one of the most helpful works for population study references.	2005-05-10

O. Wilson's thoughts outlined in his engaging book, \\"The Future of Life\\", where humanity is passing through the \\"bottleneck\\" of converging circumstances- a long history of environmental destruction, out-of-control population numbers which are depleting the Earth's resources faster than can be regenerated. In both books, education and adherence to vastly more sustainable lifestyles will be the determining factor as to whether we make it past the 21st century and into the future or we will not heed the call to reform and end up going the way of the dinosaurs.<br /><br />\\"We have met the enemy and he is us\\"- Pogo. Now that we know, will we change our destructive ways?<br /><br />We have arrived at what Elgin calls \\"Hitting the Evolutionary Wall\\" (beginning of chapter 2, p.15) and \\"Are We Are On A Collision Course With Nature?\\", so it was fitting that this chapter begins with two good quotes:<br /><br />\\"What is difficult is to imagine how to get out of the situation we're in right now in a time frame that is in line with the rate of deterioration that we're seeing.\\"- Paul Hawken [\\"Natural Capitalism\\"]. And:<br /><br />\\"If we do not change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed.\\" Indeed!<br /><br />Ancient Chinese Proverb.<br /><br />Chapter 3 begins with the mechanisms for change needed for our survival and that is: \\"A New Perceptual Paradigm: We Live In A Living Universe\\", we are interconnected to all life and need to realize that we do not live in a human-only world.

This is the stage in our evolution that we'll either continue on our destructive, insane, parasitic and unconscious collective death-wish to oblivion, or we'll heed the loud call heard here to become aware of our life-sustaining, interconnectedness to all life and start to heal our riff not only amongst ourselves, but more importantly, with Earth. To give this outstanding book a 5-star rating is not enough- it deserves 10-stars!<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with *Ecopsychology*, there is a good description and comparison of it to human-only psychology in the Epilog of this monumental work:<br /><br />\\"Just as it has been the goal of previous therapies to recover the contents of the unconscious, so the goal of ecopsychology is to awaken the inherent sense of environmental reciprocity that lies within the ecological unconscious. Other therapies seek to heal the alienation between person to person, person and family, person and society. Ecopsychology seeks to heal the more fundamental alienation between the person and the natural environment.\\" (p 320)<br /><br />The current state of affairs in the human relationship with the earth is not only ambivalent and dismissive, it is destructive, parasitic and cancerous, and yet, Planet Earth is our only life-support system- our very reason for existence. One might then be inclined to see our current relationship with our home as outright insanity. And indeed, it is!  \\"If we could assume the viewpoint of nonhuman nature, what passes for sane behavior in our social affairs might seem madness.\\" (Preface, p 13) And, of course, our \\"social affairs\\", disregarding our relationship to Earth, is riff with pathology and psychosis.<br /><br />Earth's voice is simply stated in: \\"The Earth's cry for rescue from the punishing weight of the industrial system we have created is our own cry for a scale and quality of life that will free each of us to become the complete person we were born to be.\\" (p 14)<br /><br />From the philosopher Mary Midgley in her book, \\"Beast and Man...\\": \\"[she]...finds the doctrinaire dismissal of the physical and biological worlds to be `the really monstrous thing about Existentialism.'\\" and, \\"...as if the world contained only dead matter (things) on the one hand and fully rational, educated, adult human beings on the other-as if there were no other life-forms. ...I am sure, not to the removal of God, but to this contemptuous dismissal of the biosphere-plants, animals, and children. Life shrinks to a few urban rooms; no wonder it becomes absurd.\\"  (p 66) Indeed.<br /><br />With science leading us to an awareness of the dynamics of life and Earth's self-regulating life-support systems, we have: \\"If human conduct were governed by reason alone, what science has taught us about the great ecological patterns and cycles of the planet might be enough to reform our bad environmental habits.\\" (p 95)<br /><br />This, then leads us to the very fascinating chapter 5: \\"Anima Mundi: The Search For Gaia- The Many Faces of Mother Earth\\". In the Anima Mundi, earlier human civilizations felt the wonder and presence of Earth's majestic powers, so when did humanity start to loose it's sense of awe and respect for Earth? Perhaps the advent of citification, social class structures, and certainly, industrialization might have been that point. We became fixated on blinding human concocted regimes apart from the workings and acknowledgement of  Nature.<br /><br />In Part Three- \\"Ecology\\" (p 213), there is: \\"The New Cosmology and our deepening study of ordered complexity provide the raw intellectual material for a new understanding of human connectedness with nature. In time, with enough help from artists and visionary philosophers, this body of fact and theory may mature into an ecologically grounded form of animism. We will find ourselves once again on speaking terms withnature. Within this greater environmental context, sanity and madness take on new meanings.\\"<br /><br />We will hopefully begin to understand that: \\"Industrialism, with it's rapacious use of the environment as either raw material or dumping ground, has further entrenched the city's alienation from nature.\\" (p 220)<br /><br />Therefore, \\"...the environmental movement is trying to teach us that both economics and ethics must be contained within an ecological context.\\" (p 248) This then, leads to a sane, life-enhancing, and rewarding human existence.<br /><br />One could go on and on relating the plethora of thought provoking lines found all through this masterpiece of a call to education, realization, and return to sanity in our relation-ship with Earth, but that would be burdensome for a review and this is possibly too long as it is. I highly recommend this book to everyone on the planet, especially to industry, government, and all religious orders.d madness take on new meanings.\\"    We will hopefully begin to understand that: \\"Industrialism, with it's rapacious use of the environment as either raw material or dumping ground, has further entrenched the city's alienation from nature.\\" (p 220)    Therefore, \\"...the environmental movement is trying to teach us that both economics and ethics must be contained within an ecological context.\\" (p 248) This then, leads to a sane, life-enhancing, and rewarding human existence.

Vernadsky (1863-1945) who also originated the concept of the biosphere- the \\"life zone\\" where all biological life exists between the crust of the earth to the lower atmosphere or the \\"life envelope\\" surrounding our planet.<br /><br />The \\"noosphere\\" or \\"thinking layer\\", according to Chardin, comes about at that point in time when humans evolve to the realization of a global human consciousness and is totally aware of itself and then headed for the ultimate destination- the \\"Omega Point\\" or \\"Kingdom of God\\". At this point, the earth is enveloped by a collective human consciousness.<br /><br />Chardin uses both science and theology to support this theory and his dissertation on this is fascinating and thought provoking. Unlike most of his religious peers, he was  a proponent of directional evolution and that Darwin had hit upon the proof of God's intent, that final destination of the human conscious evolution where the Creator is realized. Darwin, of  course, preferred to distance himself from theological assumptions of species evolution, especially so with us humans and his religious wife.<br /><br />Chardin distinguishes humans from all other life-forms because of our abilities to contemplate our existence, hence, the uniqueness of or the \\"phenomenon of man\\". Hopefully, he concludes, that the human family will evolve to be totally conscience, intelligent and loving, cooperative, and rising far above our current chaotic existence. Amen to that lofty, but desirable goal!<br /><br />The evolutionary path of the noosphere is laid out in Chardin's earth evolution and stated as: \\"We have been following the successive stages of the same grand progression from the fluid contours of the early earth. Beneath the pulsations of geo-chemistry, of geo-tectonic and of geo-biology, we have detected one and the same fundamental process, always recognizable-the one which was given material form in the first cells and was continued in the construction of nervous systems. We saw geogenesis promoted to biogenesis, which turned out in the end to be nothing less psychogenesis.\\" (p 181). And leading therefore, to \\"noosgenesis\\" or global consciousness. Finally, and due to the interconnectedness and seemingly intentional direction of life on earth, Chardin gives Earth a soul: Gaia thinking- Earth \\"intentionally\\" supports life.<br /><br />No wonder then that Chardin is referenced and quoted in a mountain of science and religious works. His theories have influenced such great thinkers as: Lewis Thomas<br />(\\"The Lives of a Cell\\"), Buckminster Fuller (\\"The Dymaxion Map\\"), the Gaia Theory- Earth as a conscious, intentional, self-regulating life-support system and expounded upon by Guy Murchie (\\"The Seven Mysteries of Life\\") and later by James Lovelock (Gaia: The Practical Science of Planetary Medicine\\"), Thomas Berry (\\"The Dream of the Earth\\") and many, many more.<br /><br />Chardin traveled the world on his scientific investigations and he was present at the discovery of the Peking Man in China. Some historians have intimated that much of Chardin's travels were at the behest of the Catholic Church for they were not thrilled with his attempts to blend science and religion and the farther away from Rome he was, the better.<br /><br />The church cautioned him not to publish any of his works and faithful to that edict, he left them to a friend in the U.S. to publish  posthumously to avoid further conflict and retaliation from the Church- bad memories of the history of the Catholic Church's terrible treatment of scientist and thinkers whose musings drifted from repressive, suffocating  church dogma, i.e., Galileo Galilei, et al.<br /><br />No matter where one's leanings are on religion or science, this is a potent dissertation on bringing science and religion together for awe and respect of life and eventual peace on Earth through global consciousness.ce on Earth through global consciousness.	2005-05-08

Remember the Brown Pelican and  Bald Eagle almost being killed-off from DDT poisoning? Carson's work eventually led to the banning of that harmful chemical, but as Ms Steingraber so expertly points out, there is a plethora of other dangerous chemicals on the market that tests have shown should not be.<br /><br />Sandra Steingraber wrote her book over 35 years after \\"Silent Spring\\" and having the benefit of a huge amount of accumulated evidence of chemical side-effects and personal experience with the serious health problems caused by chemical contamination of our environment, she has put together a powerful indictment of the irresponsibility of industry and government alike in their continuing agenda of down-playing the dangers of chemicals and this constitutes one of the most irresponsible and insidious snake-oil scams ever perpetrated against life.<br /><br />Huge corporate profits from the sale of deadly, often-time untested or inadequately tested chemicals purchase lackadaisical government over-sight and slick advertising on the \\"benefits\\" of chemicals.<br /><br />This book is well researched and concise, yet will give simple explanations of such topics as \\"biomagnification\\"- the accumulation of chemicals the higher up the food chain we go. Most importantly, is the topic of \\"risk as recklessness\\" in taking dangerous chemicals to market without proper safety testing, but especially allowing known carcinogens to remain on the market long after they have proven to be harmful, hence, government complicity.<br /><br />And the governments stand on this? They publish guidelines for changing one's \\"lifestyle\\" to help reduce chemical exposure! In other words, they attempt to shift responsibility for health on to the public who has no control over or proper warnings of where these chemicals are and most ludicrous of this is the fact that the spread of chemicals cannot be controlled once released into the environment, so they're everywhere and unavoidable. A good summation of this irresponsible nonsense is quoted from the anthropologist, Martha Balshem: [In the end, Balshem came to believe the lesson she was transmitting-\\"accept authority and accept blame\\"-was the wrong one].

This is a statement of hope and demonstration that capitalism can find a conscience and become aware of the benefits of an environmental and humanitarian understanding of life on Earth and the subsequent benefits in doing the enviro-friendly, humanitarian right thing in all it's affairs.<br /><br />As demonstrated by the many companies that have opened-up to sustainable, regenerative, and fair business practices- many of them examined here in detail, the monetary and social benefits of good planetary conduct is heartwarming. I will be more than happy to revisit my historical indictment of the selfish \\"Capitalist Pigs\\" as I see more positive change and this book is proof that this can and is being accomplished.<br /><br />I am an entrenched skeptic of current capitalist endeavors do to the basic definition of capitalism which is a private, self-interest affair and by that basic operating agenda, it is hard to see any positive changes in the current predatory, polluting business climate. However, \\"Natural Capitalism\\" has paved the way for private enterprise to be guided into a more democratic benefit to society.<br /><br />Indeed, the very sound of \\"private enterprise\\" harkens of self-interest, elitist, go-it-alone and nefarious doings outside of the Public's benefit, it's needs or interest. And overtones of immature, competitive \\"us vs. them\\" mentality that despises any fair-trade or environmental regulation indicts this whole affair as untenable in a civilized world.<br /><br />On pages 10-11, the basic premises of natural capitalism are delineated in \\"...four central strategies...\\"  \\"...that are a means to enable countries, companies and communities to operate by behaving as if all forms of capital were valued.\\" These are guidelines for: 1)<br /><br />\\"Radical Resource Productivity.\\" i.e., proper resource accountability and waste disposal converted to recycling and reuse. 2) \\"Biomimicry- ...eliminating the very idea of waste-...\\". Nature sustains life by recycling and reuse of  all resources. 13) \\"Service and Flow Economy.\\" \\"Closed-loop\\" relationship between producer, consumer and ecosystems. And, 4) \\"Investing In Natural Capital.\\" Investment in natural capital for a sustaining, regenerating flow of natural resources.<br /><br />\\"All four changes are interrelated and interdependent; all four generate numerous benefits and opportunities in markets, finance, materials, distribution, and employment. Together they can reduce environmental harm, create economic growth, and increase meaningful employment.\\".<br /><br />\\"What would our economy look like if it fully valued ALL forms of  capital, including human and natural capital?\\" (p 9). Indeed, knowing one's interconnectivity to all life is a good starting point and should dictate our every transaction with life. On the same page is a bulleted list of  concepts to consider under \\"Capitalism As If Living Systems Mattered\\" starting with \\"The environment is not a minor factor of production but rather is an envelope containing, provisioning, and sustaining the entire economy.\\"- Daly 1977.<br /><br />All of the bad habits of contemporary business practices are well delineated, but more importantly, the focus is centered on models for change and this isn't just business, the \\"Natural Capitalism\\" covers our personal habits and the larger society  with demonstrations of existing waste mitigation and recycling for substantial environmental and monetary savings.<br /><br />An unfortunate, but intentionally over-looked aspect of contemporary predatory business practices is to not take into account the un-paid for natural and  irreplaceable resources  (natural capital) along with the pollution left behind from industrial manufacturing processes and as biologist Peter Raven is quoted as saying on page 156, [... ecosystem services are not merely \\"a series of factors lying on the side of industrial processes, which added up could cause trouble, but rather an expression of the  functioning of a healthy Earth... [W]e're disrupting that functioning to an incredible degree\\".<br /><br />In his book \\"The Great Work \\", Thomas Berry, also the author of the beautiful \\"The Dream of the Earth\\",  chastises corporate society for it's selfish/ruthless/ parasitic/predatory/polluting business practices, yet lays out a plan for redemption for which \\"Natural Capitalism\\" spells it out in much greater detail. A call for an international code of business conduct is suggested and outlined and hopefully , this book will serve as a compelling argument for all business to learn the benefits of clean business practices.<br /><br />Otherwise, as the ancient Chinese Proverb states: \\"If we do not change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed\\".- From Duane Elgin's book \\"Promise Ahead\\".<br /><br />Shark frenzies have no winners and the \\"dog eat dog\\" world of contemporary business best be served by realizing that what goes around, comes around- Karma, 101.<br /><br />Indeed, corporate society will profit by this book if it embraces the ideas presented here and we can then take the \\"pig\\" out capitalist.<br /><br />For those who think my far-less-than enthusiastic appraisal of capitalism is too harsh, might want to see what the well researched \\"The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\\" by Joel Bakan has to say. Here, capitalism is laid wide-open for all to see it in it's narrowly focused agenda of self aggrandizement and lack of social and environmental ethics and responsibility.<br /><br />Chapter 3 starts with a fairly compact, no-nonsense over-view of current corporate structure and it`s deleterious side-effects. \\"As a psychopathic creature, the corporation can neither recognize nor act upon moral reasons to refrain from harming others. Nothing in it's legal makeup limits what it can do to others in pursuit of it's selfish ends, and it is compelled to cause harm when the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. Only pragmatic concern for it's own interests and the laws of the land constrain the corporation's predatory instincts, and often that is not enough to stop it from destroying lives, damaging communities and endangering the planet as a whole.\\"<br /><br />As with the Lovins and Hawken, Bakan believes there is redemptive hope for the corporate structure's current parasitic, predatory mindset and that is: a top to bottom overhaul of the corporate operating structure. Personally, I would love to see the results of an overhaul more closely mimic non-profit corporate structure which is based  on \\"public benefit\\" (\\"public\\" defined as an all inclusive human AND environmental, interconnected coexistence) and there is no reason why private enterprise should not be required to be a demonstrable, democratic benefit to the public. Otherwise, it is just a private, selfish,  entity- oink.<br /><br />Corporations have been predatory and non-democratic from their inception, and for another eye-opening demonstration of that, au Americana, one might take in Prof. Noam Chomsky's book \\"Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest For [corporate] Global Dominance\\". Here is history of corporate structure defectiveness and documented collusion of  government/corporate predatory, nefarious schemes.<br /><br />Before reading this book, however, pseudo-patriotic flag wavers with weak stomachs for honestly looking in the mirror of corporate America are forewarned that corporate America has some nasty skeletons in it's closet and Chomsky bars no holds in exposing that and that freedom of expression is what makes America free and the envy of all other nations. Critical appraisal is what makes it all work.<br /><br />These fine books underscore the need for re-structure of all corporate operating formats to a more humane and civilized existence for the benefit of all life on Earth, anything less is cancerous and ultimately, unsustainable, which ironically, flies in the face of existing corporate structure in that it is required to operatein a fashion that does everything possible to guarantee a continuous flow of income for their shareholders, hence, it would behoove them to take a closer interest in their corporate stock meal-tickets. And one should know that as \\"Natural Capitalism\\" conclusively proves, profit need not require an amoral, ruthless operating format.<br /><br />This is truly, the beginnings of a more wholistic relationship between society and business- an \\"operating manual\\" for doing business on planet Earth. (p 313-14).<br /><br /> My thanks to the Lovins and Hawken for this monumentally important work!Only pragmatic concern for it's own interests and the laws of the land constrain the corporation's predatory instincts, and often that is not enough to stop it from destroying lives, damaging communities and endangering the planet as a whole.\\" <br /> <br />As with the Lovins and Hawken, Bakan believes there is redemptive hope for the corporate structure's current parasitic, predatory mindset and that is: a top to bottom overhaul of the corporate operating structure.

Here is history of corporate structure defectiveness and documented collusion of  government/corporate predatory, nefarious schemes.  <br /> <br />Before reading this book, however, pseudo-patriotic flag wavers with weak stomachs for honestly looking in the mirror of corporate America are forewarned that corporate America has some nasty skeletons in it's closet and Chomsky bars no holds in exposing that and that freedom of expression is what makes America free and the envy of all other nations. Critical appraisal is what makes it all work.   <br /> <br />These fine books underscore the need for re-structure of all corporate operating formats to a more humane and civilized existence for the benefit of all life on Earth, anything less is cancerous and ultimately, unsustainable, which ironically, flies in the face of existing corporate structure in that it is required to operate in a fashion that does everything possible to guarantee a continuous flow of income for their shareholders, hence, it would behoove them to take a closer interest in their corporate stock meal-tickets. And one should know that as \\"Natural Capitalism\\" conclusively proves, profit need not require an amoral, ruthless operating format.  <br /> <br />This is truly, the beginnings of a more wholistic relationship between society and business- an \\"operating manual\\" for doing business on planet Earth. (p 313-14). <br /> My thanks to the Lovins and Hawken for this monumentally important work!  <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-05-05

Chet Raymo, a physics and astronomy professor at Stonehill College, poetically and  lyrically takes us on a \\"stroll\\" with him while he walks from his home in North Easton, Massachusetts to the college campus. He has walked this path for 37 years and by careful observation of the forested landscape, he has garnered an eternities worth of insights. One is immediately reminded or the keen observations and musings of Henry David Thoreau and John Muir, et al. \\"The Path\\" is written in an uncomplicated, approachable style for all audiences, and yet deep with wisdom and knowledge producing a broad spectrum view of the workings of the world.<br /><br />And from Raymo's musings, we see the history of the Stonehill region come to life and how it has shaped the lives of generations of people, the flora/fauna and the \\"natural\\" landscape with special attention to the early entrepreneurs who most influenced the region, their motivations of nation building, personal wealth and the current display of their legacies.<br /><br />We get an over-view of geologic transformations, biological processes, and the building blocks of all physical manifestations through the coding of DNA strands. The interconnectedness of all life and our tinkering with nature resulting in such side-effects and backlashes as global warming and broken down natural resource distribution cycles.<br /><br />From the wintertime stroll, we get observations of: \\"The tiny six-pointed snowflake is, on a deeper level, a buzzing hive of molecular vibrations. And so, too, the lush diversity of life in the water meadow, examined more closely, resolves itself into a fandango of dancing molecules. The seen is a mask for the unseen. Our eyes open at birth to a flood of photons, but we must learn to see.\\" (p. 146)<br /><br />The careful observations of nature in action through all four seasons from a stroll on this path creates a summation of our evolving human relation to life on the planet in such thoughts as: \\"Knowledge once gained cannot be unlearned, and knowledge is power. For better or worse, the future of the planet has been handed to us, not by a deity but by fate. Stewardship of other creature is in our hands.\\"  \\"...an understanding of the ecological wholeness of the Earth suggest that our altruism should extend to other creatures, too: plants, animals, even microbes.\\" And, \\"Environmental conservation-clean water and air, a steady climate- is in the interest of our species.\\" (p. 171)<br /><br />This is a beautiful melding of the thoughts and observations of such greats as the sociobiologist, E. O. Wilson, \\"The Future of Life\\", Thomas Berry, \\"The Dream of the Earth\\", et al. who are all in unison with the profound need for humanity to seriously embrace an ethic of life stewardship for the survival of our beautiful blue planet Earth.

Further, Aldus Huxley, author of \\"Brave New World\\", was so impressed with the ideas presented in \\"Walden Two\\", that he incorporated and expanded on them in his last novel, \\"Island\\". And many people feel this was his best work. I concur.<br /><br />The book is not a monument to fine novel writing and was not intended to be, yet it is  fascinating and eye-opening as a fictional dissertation on utopian social structure can be. Huxley's \\"Island\\", on the other hand was beautifully written and requires no awareness of the psychology of social construction going on at the same time- neither book does, really. They are both interesting and thought provoking.<br /><br />Skinner's basic premise was that with gentle behavioral modifications using positive re-enforcement and academics, coupled with leveling the social playing field with no class structure our hyper-competitive, private enterprise, we could then concentrate all of our energies on education and entertainment, thereby removing most all of the ills and stress that conventional society suffers from- sounds enticing, on paper anyway.<br /><br />B.F. Skinner was a famous research psychologist who had a life-time of noted insights into the human psyche and his constant experimentation with behavioral studies led him to map-out, in a fictional utopian setting, a demonstration of what the supposed benefits of behavioral modification would do for a large group of people. He was not trying to be a novelist, rather he was submitting to a broader audience than his peers, a theoretic utopian society that the general public could assess on their own and no doubt, Skinner was probably keen to see how the public would respond- further studies of human response to mechanisms- his favorite occupation.<br /><br />His very clinical approach to human behavioral studies was often criticized, but he was always quick to point out that he had no interest in debate on his methods. The following two paragraphs are borrowed from Skinner's bio seen at the Muskingum College, New Concord, Ohio website Skinner pages. Material was compiled by Christa Swenson, 1999.<br /><br />\\"Skinner was never highly influenced by critical reactions, he is not interested in the right or wrong because they are either effective or ineffective, and arguments of no avail. For that reason he is not interested in psychological theories, rational equations, or other verbal systems that are required to be proven right.\\"- whoa.  And:<br /><br />[Following the principles of Bacon, Skinner rejects verbal authority, stating, \\"I have studied nature not books asking questions of the organism rather than those who have studied the organism.\\"... \\"Observation overemphasizes stimuli; experimentation includes the rest of the contingencies which generate repertoires\\" (Dews, 1970, p18).]<br /><br />It is interesting to note about his life that he is mainly remembered  for such famous/infamous experiments as his \\"Skinner Box\\"- a replica of the famous Russian psychologist, Ivan Pavlov and his \\"Pavlov's Dog\\" positive response contraption. To say the least, he was highly impressed with Pavlov's work, but instead of dogs, he preferred rats and humans for study subjects and behavior reaction, not dog saliva studies (however interesting that might be).<br /><br />So I would imagine that if Skinner were alive today, he would get a kick out of the reviews here that are somewhat unflattering and he would have no problem brushing them off as he would also see fit to do with the flattering ones.<br /><br />His Walden Two book was influenced by the writing of Henry David Thoreau's \\"Walden\\" (Note the borrowed title) and many other similar writers. No wonder then, that he was keen to let that influencemellow his somewhat starchy, clinical outlook when he wrote it. And we are thankful for that- it made for a much more human and pleasing read.<br /><br />Understandably, it does not please many that his story characters had embraced such social quirks as seeing no benefit in saying \\"thank you\\" and many other social graces- this is Skinner's personality coming through: social graces are a waste time. Level-headed, nothing-to-hide, and non-competitive people supposedly don`t need that nonsense.<br /><br />Did Skinner miss something in the demonstrated efficacy of social courtesy? No matter, he lets many of his characters have their conventional, \\"good\\" social habits- he has to, to show contrast.<br /><br />The communal setting the book describes is egalitarian, fair and desires no material gain other than  normal sustenance. Labor needs are divvied-up at the start of each day and earn the communards \\"work credits\\" to ensure that they work a minimal amount for their keep. Over-work is discouraged and considered counter-productive, education and entertainment are much more important and with a large labor pool, daily chores can be completed quickly.<br /><br />New incoming members must agree to the communities social dictates: \\"The Walden Code\\" , a set of easy rules of conduct for harmony in the communal setting. Administrative members called \\"Planners\\" have a bit more leeway and can over-ride the rules when dealing with the outside world. All social positions are on a rotating basis including work, to facilitate an even distribution of duties so everyone can gain experience of the total spectrum of communal life.<br /><br />So what became of the communities that formed on Skinner's ideas? Many of them are still going and the most renown one modeled completely around Walden Two, \\"Twin Oaks Community\\", is still at it. Kathleen \\"Kat\\" Kinkade, one of the founding members, wrote a book about the \\"real\\" experimental commune, \\"A Walden Two Experiment\\"- Foreword by Skinner himself.<br /><br />This assessment of the project was written about two years into the project and then followed by another report, \\"Is It Utopia Yet?: An Insider's View of Twin Oaks Community In Its 26th Year\\". Kat Kinkade is now the longest standing member and although she left the community for some time and then returned, she has a substantial history and intimate view of the project.

Wilson has produced a map of recovery from the devastation we have wrought on Earth and it's life-support systems in this monumental book. As he so expertly points out,  humanity is at the \\"bottleneck \\" stage of existence right now: that worrisome convergence point where all of our past environmental mistakes have caught up with us and met our current unsustainable resource use that  huge population and unrealistic life style demands create.<br /><br />Add to that, Earth's life-cycle mechanics being thrown out of whack by global warming and dwindling green cover resources that help regulate it, water scarcity, pollution, and we have a dire pan of worms on our hands. Wilson maintains, however, that our vast accumulated reservoir of technology and abundant earth resource-cycle knowledge can help us through the bottleneck and on to a more rational, thoughtful, and harmonious future with Earth's regulation processes influencing all of our ethical and moral guidelines in our activities on Earth.<br /><br />On the front cover is a beautiful art rendering of what, at first appears to be an expertly produced flower arrangement. But taking a closer look at it reveals a collage of plants and animals that are extinct or on the verge of extinction and then on pages viii to x is a diagram and list of the cover species and listed by common and taxonomic names.<br /><br />Next, is the Prologue which is a letter to Henry David Thoreau. It is actually a dialogue of Wilson having a posthumous conversation with Thoreau at Walden's Pond where in part, he explains to H.D.T what state of environmental affairs we are now in- very moving!<br /><br />Wilson's writing style is very gentle, sometimes poetic, and an easy flowing discourse packed with compelling punch lines for thoughtful consideration of  the subject matter at hand: hopeful survival of all Earth's flora/fauna. And he posits this can be accomplished in dialogue such as:<br /><br /> \\"In order to pass through the bottleneck, a global land ethic is urgently needed.\\" and, \\"Surely the rest of life matters. Surely our stewardship is our only hope. We will be wise to listen to the heart, then act with rational intention and all the tools we can gather and bring to bear.\\" And, \\"The great dilemma of environmental reasoning stems from this conflict between short-term and long-term values.\\"<br /><br />For those that are familiar with the works of Thomas Berry- \\"The Dream of the Earth\\" and \\"The Great Work\\",  Chet Raymo- \\"The Path\\", et al., Hawkin and Lovins- \\"Natural Capitalism\\" and many more such fine thinkers and doers, will no doubt be impressed with the ground that Wilson covers with his very realistic, but guarded pronouncement that we humans will get through the bottleneck if we immediately start listening to the voices of reason and start embracing what life-style changes we need in order enhance our survival possibilities. To be sure, it is a crap shoot in our survival odds, but Wilson helps bump-up those odds with his guarded enthusiasm based on a life-time of biology and environmental study. There is an abundance of resources and organizations mentioned all through this great work. Thank you, Prof. E. O.

Kinsey	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	Kinsey's Life & Work Expertly and Thoroughly Summarized	This book is so professionally researched, well documented and written with flowing, easy to follow prose, that it almost over-shadows the subject matter which is, of course,  the fascinating life and work of Alfred C. Kinsey, and culminating with his most absorbing research work of all: the sexual habits of primarily, the American public.<br /><br />But don't worry, the study of sex prevails as the intriguing winner of our primary attention for it is spelled out clearly, sometimes more than one is ready for but can't turn away from and do not honestly want to. And a word of warning to the sexually squeamish- this IS sex, all about sex and sexual habits, many of which, one might not have ever thought of, but necessary for an exacting, broad-spectrum all inclusive study of the human animal.<br /><br />J. Gathorne-Hardy is British and that shows up in his grammar, so don't think the book is full of typos, that's the way they spell on the other side of the Pond and it lends some flavor to the American subject matter. As can be seen in his detailed research, he is a well qualified researcher, and this work is now considered by many as the de facto authority on all things Kinsey. And fortunately so because there are a tremendous amount of books about Kinsey in print, but rest assured and good as many may be, none can hold a candle to this work.<br /><br />Kinsey's research was as clinically studied as any highly disciplined research should be, but it is no secret that Kinsey and his fellow researchers did a tremendous amount of, ahem, shall we say, \\"hands-on\\", direct involvement work which raised scholarly eyebrows, but as Gathorne-Hardy points out, it was done with the most scientific detachment possible. Yes, well, it certainly made for some scandalous reactions for which Kinsey was acutely trying to avoid, but had an uncanny ability to dismiss and side-step.<br /><br />For those who have been interested in Kinsey's life and work, but were put-off by the voluminous  original works, will certainly appreciate this study, because it not only summarizes Kinsey's work in great detail, it also edits down the laborious writing style of Kinsey, without  loosing any important details and most importantly, it includes Kinsey's personal life from early childhood and on to his later research work- something that is missing and/or not accurately portrayed  in too many other studies. It also covers many of the people who worked with Kinsey and who graciously lent their personal observations to the author for much of the critical data found here-in.<br /><br />This book is truly, an outstanding accomplishment and honors the deeply important work of  Kinsey and his research team, notorious as many saw it, but whose dogged dedication to the subject of sex  studies opened-up a more mature approach for the average citizen's awareness of what most now conclude, is step \\"A\\" in knowing oneself and the biological world we live in. I highly commend Jonathon Gathorne-Hardy for this monument to that awareness.uminous  original works, will certainly appreciate this study, because it not only summarizes Kinsey's work in great detail, it also edits down the laborious writing style of Kinsey, without  loosing any important details and most importantly, it includes Kinsey's personal life from early childhood and on to his later research work- something that is missing and/or not accurately portrayed  in too many other studies.

These three stories are amongst London's best fictional works- some say they *are* the best, especially, \\"The Call of the Wild\\" and \\"White Fang\\", it all depends on one's taste, of course, but rest assured, these stories are gripping and the intrigue of their moving plots keeps one glued to the book.<br /><br />As a freind once said of \\"Call...\\" and \\"...Fang\\": \\"These are just about the two doggone best [canine] stories I have ever had the pleasure to read!\\". Indeed.<br /><br />All three stories are set in Alaska during the gold rush days of the late 1800's and London spent time there to absorb the feeling of this beautiful, but unforgiving land. He is so descriptive of the landscape, one feels like they are there themselves. This is the magic of London's writing- he so expertly drops the reader right into the scenery and the characters. Indeed, we see and feel what they see and feel- even the animals- especially, the animals, for they have personalities that engage and create both sympathy and admiration  for their trials, tribulations and triumphs. London is one of those that the measure of literary genius is judged by and taking in just about any of his works will demonstrate why.<br /><br />The basic storyline of the \\"The Call of the Wild\\" has a dog named \\"Buck\\" who is living in a comfortable setting in California, suddenly yanked away by black-market dog thieves who are selling them to the ravenous needs of the gold prospector's supply market where they are then pressed into the tortuous dogsled industry. Buck eventually gets free and joins his native soul-brothers, the wolves. From the human world back to his ancestral roots, hence, the calling of the wild instinct.<br /><br />\\"White Fang\\" is the antithesis of  Buck`s situation: a wolf pup raised partly by Indians, wolves, and eventually being absorbed all the way into the human world... you guessed it, in California where he settles into the same basic comfortable world that Buck was torn from. The tale of how that turn-of-events happens is as engaging as Buck's story.<br /><br />\\"To Build A Fire\\" is a very short read and describes a man and the unforgiving, harsh winter of the Alaskan outback. He finds himself trapped by an intense snow storm and soon realizes that this normally easy trek is turning dangerous. What will happen? London skillfully gives us the psychological drama of harsh realities setting in.<br /><br />For those that have not yet taken in any of London's work, this book is a good place to start. One might then want to take in more, including London's non-fictional work.as engaging as Buck's story.    \\"To Build A Fire\\" is a very short read and describes a man and the unforgiving, harsh winter of the Alaskan outback.

We all perceive reality at what ever level or experience we have been absorbed in, the trick is to get beyond any constraints that might blind us to the bigger view that encompasses all existence. Yes, a tall order indeed, but doable as Storm demonstrates through his song of the medicine shields.<br /><br />Walking with Storm on this beautiful trail called \\"Seven Arrows\\", will open up grand vistas of a larger reality. All points of the reality compass are here to be seen, felt and absorbed.<br /><br />Storm so eloquently shows us how quietly listening and observing reality from as many points of view and directions as possible will deliver a vast array of those tiny puzzle pieces that when combined, make up the whole picture. Freeing oneself from dogmatic, less-than-clear strictures whether they be caused by one's religious, socio-economic, political, or family upbringing, will allow a clear view even from a new, never experienced vantage point. Walk in your brother or sister's shoes for a mile before judging their reality; see the world through the wide view of the eagle- the macro; see the world from the view of a little mouse who only sees fine details- the micro world- it is all right here to see the many points of reality for a more inclusive view of the world around us.<br /><br />Hyemeyohsts Storm has put together in this one beautiful book what a thousand other worldly wise people have attempted and that is a way or path to seeing, feeling and embracing other realities that are all part of the one, singular  reality that demonstrates the interconnectedness of all life.<br /><br />Tales of  the chaos caused by the intrusion of the Euros and their land/resource grabbing ways makes for some sad commentary on culture clash, especially when one comes to see here what beautiful lifestyles The People had and their willingness to share their wisdom.<br /><br />This is somewhat in contrast to the other interspersed through the book, lyrical journeys through the eyes of various animals that demonstrate the many levels of perception, but it all blends into a complete whole.<br /><br />The prose of this book travel between poetic, lyrical, song-like.

This is what you give back to the earth. The idea of waste, of something unusable, reveals an incomplete understanding of how things work.<br /><br />Nature admits no waste. Nothing is left over; everything is joined in the spiral of life. Perhaps other cultures know this better than we, for they have no concept of, no word for, waste\\". And under that thought provoking consideration of resource cycles, there is:<br /><br />\\"A sound man is good at salvage, at seeing nothing is lost\\"- Lao Tze, 500 B.C.<br /><br />The intro is by Wendell Berry, farmer, novelist, poet. He posits that \\"modern\\" effluent mitigation is as insane as drinking right from an un-flushed toilet: \\"It is not inconceivable that some psychiatrist would ask me knowingly why I wanted to mess up my drinking water in the first place\\". Indeed.<br /><br />After the fascinating human waste history lessons, we are given a short crash-course on the biology of waste, then it's on to the fruit of the book: dry composting toilet designs and their efficacy. This is in good detail and makes for a complete handbook on waterless toilet design.<br /><br />Finally, there is the Epilogue and I would be amiss in my review if I did not reveal a little taste of it: [Any technology divorced from the whole of nature tends to produce a condition that poet Robert Graves calls \\"mechanarchy\\": the perfection of technological means to produce a chaotic sterile environment. The current technology of \\"waste disposal\\" (the term reveals the syndrome) is still fighting a war against nature, built on fragments of 19th century science not yet integrated into an understanding of life processes as a unified, but cyclical, whole.\\"] True enough!<br /><br />An excellent companion book to \\"Toilet Papers\\" is Joseph Jenkins' \\"The Humanure Handbook\\"- all one needs to know about how to safely compost one's excrement back to a nutrient rich plant food for a full-circle life cycle.nature tends to produce a condition that poet Robert Graves calls \\"mechanarchy\\": the perfection of technological means to produce a chaotic sterile environment.

Should be read and reread.\\" (Saturday Review of Literature)<br /><br />To emphasize the various personalities, the main characters are either protracted, conniving greedy bums or thinking, sensitive intellects; the rest are on the fence and waiting to see which way the wind blows and when presented with contrasting, colliding circumstances, which emotions will pull them in which ultimate, life altering direction?<br /><br />I have read this book a few times now and it is always thought provoking and engaging. Huxley's prose are flowing and captivating, leaving one with a sense of longing for an undisturbed version of  Huxley's Island to move to with it's beautiful, conscious inhabitants and their intriguing, life enhancing, experimental social structure lived in a harmonious, loving and literate by choice social setting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are under siege by forces beyond their control- we think, for had Huxley lived, he might have followed this book with a sequel that ultimately had the \\"Islanders\\" triumph over their greedy, evil opposites. As it stands, we're left with an apparent sense of impending doom for the island paradise- an attempt to \\"civilize\\" it with a new, materialistic society based on competition and greed. Gee, sounds like the real world!<br /><br />Those who love a well crafted, moving story line will appreciate Island just for the intrigue and flow of  a good novel, regardless of the socio-psychological ramifications involved.<br /><br />A note of interest on alternative, experimental communities is that B.F. Skinner's block-buster book, \\"Walden II\\" was possibly, as many people believe, the inspiration for Huxley`s Island and there are many parallels in their respective story lines. Dialogue in Island mentions alternative communities such as Oneida. The famous \\"Twin Oaks Community\\" was designed around Skinner's fictional Walden II utopian farm.tions involved.

I stumbled across this book in a library book store and being familiar with the essence of what Ms Hill was trying to accomplish along with my penchant for admiring those who question authority and are willing to stand-up for what they believe in, I sat down and started reading it. Intrigued, I brought it home and read it all the way through- it was a captivating, inspiring journey!<br /><br />Ms Hill relates the story of her upbringing and how she was taught \\"to question authority\\" and as her father told her, \\"Never take what someone else says as absolute truth\\". In other words, question all authority, but with grace. Her life background story reads like a script for a future activist with care and dedication so the tree-sit came somewhat as a natural for her. This did not make the effort any easier, however.<br /><br />Although many questioned Ms Hill's dogged and dangerous dedication to Luna, a 200ft. tall ancient redwood tree that she bravely stayed up in for 2 years, none can deny the immense courage and perseverance she conjured-up to withstand ferocious wind, rain, snow and constant harassment from the lumber company who like any dedicated, hungry termite, was frustrated in being denied it's meal and tried every trick in the book to force her down from her beautiful perch in the sky with a grand view of the Headwaters Forest region.<br /><br />I am confidant that such luminaries and heroes of the environmental movement that now reside in the heavens high above the trees, such as: John Muir, Aldo Leopold (\\"A Sand County Almanac\\"), Rachel Carson (\\"Silent Spring\\")  that old enviro rascal, \\"Cactus\\" Edward Abbey (\\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\"), and certainly, Henry David Thoreau (\\"Walden\\" and \\"Civil Disobedience\\"), were smiling down on Ms Hill and friends, lending their spirit of support.<br /><br />Ms Hill even got admiration and support from such curious and unexpected avenues as \\"Good Housekeeping Magazine\\"!??  Oh, I get it, Good 'Tree-housekeeping'.<br /><br />One of the most prestigious nods for Ms Hill that I have seen came from the famous sociobiologist, Prof. E. O. Wilson in his beautiful book, \\"The Future of Life\\", where he gives a compelling call for an internationally binding environmental ethics doctrine for appropriate and sustainable resource use. The nod starts on page 188 (hb edition) with, \\"The protest groups are the early warning system for the natural economy. They are the living world's immunological response. They ask us to listen. Julia (Butterfly) Hill, the young lady who lived 180 feet up in a California redwood tree for two years...\\". \\"...Bless them all.\\" (the environmental protestors). From such a distinguished scientist as Wilson, that is quite an affirmation of the tree-sit!<br /><br />This tree-sit accomplished a plethora of good in that it opened-up direct talks with the Pacific Lumber Co., who, along with other such companies, are normally antagonistic and not interested in debate and prefer to stick to an  adversarial posture. Very importantly, there was a huge amount of international attention drawn to the nefarious and questionable ways the U.S. Government handles logging permits without proper environmental review and resource damage assessments.<br /><br />Great acts of courage often-time create dangerous circumstances both for the protestors and their counterparts. Time and time again, there were injuries and scary close-calls, and tragically, one of Ms Hill's friends, David \\"Gypsy\\" Chain, was killed by a falling cut tree at Grizzly Creek. He gave his life for a very worthy cause and in honor of his memory,  Ms Hill and her support team reinvigorated their efforts.<br /><br />This tree-sit could not have happened without a huge base of support from Ms Hill's ground crew who had to run the gauntlet of security guards and angry loggers that tried to starve  Julia out of the tree by blocking access to her supplies. Also, there were a number celebrities, some of which,  climbed up into Luna to visit with her and lend their support.<br /><br />So all things considered Ms Hill, I believe that it was a beautiful, productive 2 years of you and your friend's lives that you gave to Luna and the forests yet to be saved. Thank you all!<br /><br />In memory of David \\"Gypsy\\" Chain, you are with the giants now.d Ms Hill, I believe that it was a beautiful, productive 2 years of you and your friend's lives that you gave to Luna and the forests yet to be saved. Thank you all!    In memory of David \\"Gypsy\\" Chain, you are with the giants now.	2005-04-27
US	39685710	RAN0TZFZYW867	0716741660	631517617	The Mammal in the Mirror	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Further Explorations of the "The Naked Ape"	The Barash team has done an outstanding job of expanding on the basic theme put forth by Desmond Morris in his book, \\"The Naked Ape\\" which is a serious anatomical, biological, anthropological and sociological, yet humorous examination of us quirky human beings.<br /><br />With a sizeable quantity of shared insight, humor and wit, the Barash team has gone way beyond the traditional norms of the study of biology. This book is part biology, ecology, health and nutrition, and sociobiology and yet is an easy, flowing read.<br /><br />The book format was intentionally crafted for general audience appeal and does not overwhelm with too much technical jargon and yet, does not skimp on important details of biological importance. Indeed, the Barash's have met their desire to help the reader become \\"bioliterate\\" and it starts with advice on human biology education with such lines as: \\"...if you want to see a perfectly good mammal, look in the mirror\\" and, \\"Like Immanuel Kant, we can all dare to know\\". Hence, the title of this educational and entertaining book: \\"Mammal in the Mirror\\". So look in this \\"mirror\\" and know thyself!<br /><br />Previous reviews have done a fine job of covering the contents chapter by chapter, so I will just point out some of the many gems I found in this fine book:<br /><br />The Barash's proffer for our consideration, the importance of knowing something about our biology in: \\"Anyone inclined to look further, into evolutionary biology--or indeed any area of biology--cannot help being overwhelmed by the truth and beauty of the human interconnectedness to the rest of life\\". (p 280)<br /><br />On our continuing human dilemma of creating problems for ourselves, yet showing how unique we are as a species in our abilities to expand our awareness of  biology and life itself by finding causation and answers to problems--such as the discovery of and vaccine for the smallpox disease, there is: \\"In an age of misery--much of it human-caused--the triumph over smallpox is a matter for rejoicing.\\" (p 47).<br /><br />[\\"Descartes is also the author of what is probably the most famous sentence in Western thought--\\"Cognito ergo sum\\": \\"I think, therefore I am\\"--which he proposed as the cornerstone of a philosophy to be founded on incontrovertible truth. (Ambrose Bierce modified this to \\"Cognito cognito ergo cognito sum\\": \\"I think I think, therefore I think I am\\"--adding that this was as close to certainty as philosophy seems likely to get.)]. (p 141-2).<br /><br />On human sexuality: \\"Fortunately, abstinence is not the only way of preventing reproduction. We have already discussed abortion, albeit briefly. Most people--whether pro-life or pro-choice--agree that recourse to abortion is, in a sense, an indication of failure. Far better to prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place.\\" (p 187-8) Indeed!<br /><br />On matters of ecology,  I found this to be a good one: [\\"If you are a poet,\\" writes Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, \\"you will see that there is a cloud in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper.\\"...] and [If you too, can see the cloud in this sheet of paper, then maybe you are also a poet, a Zen master--or an ecologist. The cornerstone ecological concept is easy to grasp although often difficult to act upon. It is also remarkably similar to the fundamental insight of Eastern mysticism: the interconnectedness of all things.\\"]<br />(p 239)<br /><br />The last chapter, \\"Evolution: The Road Stretches Out\\", was the most intriguing to me in that it hits upon such matters such as biological and/or evolutionary ethics. References to such luminaries of biology as E. O. Wilson, who has expanded on and promoted sociobiology as a guideline for human relationships with all other life forms, is well covered. Indeed, ethics derived from the biological processes of life itself, seems to be a logical basis on which to found human conduct codes. In consideration of how we humans are environmentally and therefore, biologically, trashing the life-sustaining attributes of our shared ecology, a call for biologically based ethics seems to be in order.<br /><br />I thank and commend the Barash father/daughter team for this outstanding book!ogically, trashing the life-sustaining attributes of our shared ecology, a call for biologically based ethics seems to be in order.

Good Luck!	\\"The Corporation\\" is one of my dream books come true. It is a well researched bare knuckles expose of the structure and structural defects of the for-profit corporate entity. Prof. Bakan has expertly exposed why corporations are so often seen as parasitic and predatory- like maladjusted children or glitch-ridden robotic programs, set loose like the proverbial bull-in-a-china-shop, trashing anything that gets in the way of their blind, rabid, selfish lust for profit at all costs.<br /><br />One should know, however, that Bakan is not an anti-capitalist zealot. Rather, he only takes issue here with what he sees as the central corporate problem and that is a defective operating blueprint in dire need of a serious, rapid overhaul- top to bottom. He sees the corporate entity as easily brought into conformity with a new civilized operating structure- a structure based on public benefit, responsibility and concern for sustainable resource use, environmental sensitivity and most importantly, a humane and fair distribution of corporate profits.<br /><br />Sounds like a pipe-dream? While I am more skeptical than most about the success probabilities of trying to potty-train irresponsible parasites like the infamous \\"capitalist-corporate pigs\\", Bakan certainly appears to understand the fundamental need of  corporations and that is: the obsessive, pathological desire to stay in business and keep making money at all costs- even if that means being hemmed into civility for their very survival. And shareholders are well-advised to take note of this, continued stock value depends on sustainable, lawful conduct.<br /><br />With a carrot of continued profits dangling in their sights, and convinced by the success of other corporations that have seen the light and profit in applying sustainable/regenerative practices, it is still a crap-shoot, but Bakan seems to have an abundance of guarded faith that a corporate structural overhaul will save the day.<br /><br />This same guarded optimism is seen in the writings of one of the most famous government and corporate critics of them all, Prof. Noam Chomsky, who also holds no punches when pointing-out the nefarious schemes and skullduggery of corporations and government alike and this can be seen in his book, \\"Hegemony or survival...\\", et al.<br /><br />In their book, \\"Natural Capitalism\\", authors Lovins and Hawken are very enthusiastic also about the success of those corporations who have made a remarkable turn-around in their refined, socially responsible operating methods and profits are soaring for them. All they needed was a little, OK, a lot of guidance to get on the right track, but their current growth-rate demonstrates that, a) It can be done, and, b) success is the reward for doing the right thing.<br /><br />In his book \\"The Great Work\\", Thomas Berry is also onboard with Bakan and Chomsky in pointing out from top to bottom, the defects of current corporate structure along with the environmentally, unsustainable, resource depleting life styles of the general public and does not mince words in chastising this foolhardy, un-Godly dead-end existence, but with an abundance of positive guidance to a more sane relationship with all life.<br /><br />Can corporations change for the good? They must! Their survival, let alone common decency and civility demand it, so here is a simple, but profound ancient Chinese Proverb they can chew on for motivation: \\"If we do not change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed.\\" ...and in this case, that is the chaos of a corporate shark frenzy- and there are no winners there. (Proverb borrowed from Duane Elgin's book, \\"Promise Ahead\\").<br /><br />Corporations are  well advised to take seriously Joel Bakan's message and the `profit' in doing so will undoubtedly be rewarding.

If one needs a guideline to what constitutes American freedom of the press, it's demonstrated here by the no-holds barred display of the history and current status of American Foreign Policy and it's nefarious collusion of  the corporate predatory agenda in the guise of \\"official\\" American global policy and behind the backs of the American public.<br /><br />Prof. Chomsky's strict adherence to well documented, but not so publicly displayed records of corporate/government global shenanigans is an eye-opening indictment of what's wrong with Corporate America- and thats it in a nutshell: \\"Corporate America\\" v. \\"America of the People, by the People, and for the people\\"- what part about that declaration do corporations and their political pimps not understand?<br /><br />Flag wavers with weak stomachs for America `exposed' need to be warned that Chomsky sets the parameters of what constitutes freedom of speech and therefore, what makes America the envy of all other nations. The right to critically analyze and question one's own government is the hallmark of American freedoms and Chomsksy does it with fortitude and courage like few others.<br /><br />On the back cover of this fine book is adulation from the New York Times: \\"Judged in terms of the power, range, novelty, and influence of his thought, Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive.\\" Of course, there are many such heroes in print but certainly, Prof. Chomsky is at the top of the integrity pyramid with his profound sense of duty to truth and call for restructuring of American corporate  business/government relationships. Indeed, who is the government suppose to serve, the citizens or the corporations-who have distanced themselves from over-sight and regulation and operate on a selfish anti-democratic basis?<br /><br />For a good example of Chomsky's expose on American foreign policy and as dictated by corporate influence,  there is: [Contempt for international law and institutions was particularly flagrant in the Reagan-Bush years-the first reign of Washington's current incumbents-and their successors continued to make it clear that the U.S. reserved the right to act \\"unilaterally when necessary,\\" including the \\"unilateral use of military power\\" to defend such vital interests as \\"ensuring access to key markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources.\\" But the posture was not exactly new.] (p 15)<br /><br />And one wonders why both in the U.S. and internationally,  legions of people are calling foul on the predatory \\"Capitalist Pigs\\" and the U.S. Government's unlawful and unethical enforcement of the nefarious, selfish, predatory American corporate  agenda?<br /><br />While the good Prof. Chomsky rails on corporate influence, etc., he offers solutions and hope for this dismal history of American corporate chicanery. This can be seen all through his work and by-the-way, this is the purpose of his work, as I see it, to help America become what it purports to be, and every decent citizen wants it to be- a monument to honesty, integrity, and the democratic way. Indeed, Chomsky is not a<br />of profit doom, rather an avatar of change for the good of all- globally all- not just America.<br /><br />On page 235 is a good example of  hope in this book: \\"It would be a great error to conclude that the prospects are uniformly bleak. Far from it. One very promising development is the slow evolution of a human rights culture among the general population...that accelerated in the 1960s...heightened concern for civil and human rights, including rights of minorities, women, and future generations...environmental movement...\\", etc.<br /><br />What comes across here, above all, is the important need to revamp U.S. Foreign Policy and corporate influence. Is the government the exclusive benefactor of business or the people? We have separation of church and state (although one would never know it with the current administration)- we also need separation of state and the corporate agenda!<br /><br />Is capitalism inherently rotten and incompatible with a civilized society? In it's current structure and influence on government, absolutely, but as with Chomsky, and many others, they believe a redefining of priorities can straighten-out this pan of worms. In the book \\"Natural Capitalism\\" by Lovins and Hawken, is a fine demonstration of reprioritizing current corporate structure and bringing a sense of global responsibility and compatibility with civilized, interconnected consciousnesses at the helm and many examples of corporations that have seen the \\"light\\" of interconnectivity with the rest of the world, are profiting by the guidelines delineated here.<br /><br />Also, there is the blast-furnace expose of current corporate structure and it's deleterious side-effects on all life in the book, \\"The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power\\" by Joel Bakan. A serious indictment of current corporate structure, but again, with guidelines and ideas for an equable resolution with hope for a better world.<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least is Thomas Berry's, \\"The Great Work\\". This is another chastisement of current corporate structure, along with society's in general misguided and cancerous direction.  However, a format for redemption is the focus of this fine book.<br /><br />Finally, there is the profound admonition found in the ancient Chinese Proverb: \\"If we do not change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed.\\"  and that is: global chaos- my assessment.<br /><br />\\"What is difficult is to imagine how to get out of the situation we're in right now in a time frame that is in line with the rate of deterioration that we're seeing.\\"- Paul Hawken.<br /><br />Proverb and quote from Hawken taken from Duane Elgin's book, \\"Promise Ahead\\".ith a civilized society?

When one comes to understand the dynamics of water, it should not be considered a stretch to then see water as life itself and hence, the \\"Noblest Element\\".<br /><br />Masaru Emoto has studied water for years using an intriguing method of analyzing various samples of water from the crystals formed when frozen. Pure water forms beautiful prism-like ice-matrices, while polluted water forms distorted, or no ice-matrices at all.<br /><br />Perhaps the most amazing discovery of Masaru's research is that water demonstrates that it  has sentient qualities by reacting with  healthy or sick responses to various stimuli such as good, loving thoughts or bad, negative thoughts. These same studies were performed on plants with the same results and related in the book, \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\" by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird. Both books conclude that ALL life is sentient and dynamic.<br /><br />Skeptical or not, one should  find this study of water and ice-crystals to be fascinating and  with the many beautiful photographs of  crystals included, that makes the book worth the time all on it's own. Indeed, there are few other forms of art so profoundly beautiful, whether from Nature or humans, that can compare with the awesome matrices formed by ice-crystals, especially those from pure, un-polluted water.<br /><br />In her book, \\"Taking The Waters: Spirit, Art, Sensuality\\", Alev Croutier also relates the need for respect of water and humble feelings of gratitude for all that it does for us. This is a perspective and over-view of the history of how humans have been \\"taking the waters\\" from drinking, to baths, to health spas and more, and all over the world. Towards the end of this beautiful, colorful book, there is a prophecy of the water story from the Cogui Indians who live in the Columbian Mountains and have decided to break their traditional isolation from the outside world by giving humanity a strong warning about the abuse of water and environment.<br /><br />In the Cogui language, the word for water and spirit is the same.

Much of the history came from the Indians themselves, but interestingly, a significant, accurate and comprehensive library of data is documented in the U.S. Government Indian Affairs Archives and the U.S. Congressional Record Archives from which McNickle gleaned an abundance of fascinating and enlightening \\"behind the scenes\\" records of how the U.S. dealt with Indians.<br /><br />Clearly, there was both empathy and distrust mixed with a sense of \\"Manifest Destiny\\" which played out in a clumsy and too often, tragedy of errors and poor judgment. We are now in the times of reconciliation and due process for a more balanced and equitable association with our Indian hosts.<br /><br />McNickle researched these resources extensively in his academic career and the benefits of his scholarly dedication to detail is evident in his writings. There is no other treatment of the Indian story that I know of that is as complete, scholarly and educational as this work.<br /><br />This book was not intended to be an indictment of the U.S. Government's treatment of Indians, although it is clear that the U.S. has a grossly checkered past in it's dealings with them and by it's own admission. Rather, this book is a beautiful historical documentation of a justifiably proud people who were as diverse in their cultural habits as the number of different tribes that existed before the Europeans came on the scene.<br /><br />While varied in appearance cultural habits, all of the tribes shared a profound sense of respect for the environment and a keen knowledge of stewardship for the sustainability of the natural resources they depended on. Contrast that with the lustful, greedy, exploitation of land and resources by the European's perverse habit of taking all they could grab for themselves and we see a sad story of culture clash that almost wiped-out the Indians and the habitability of the land they once occupied along with such beautiful animals as the bison, which  freely roamed the plains of an open country with a plethora of  resources for all.<br /><br />This monumental book should be read by all students of Indian and U.S. history, and it has a flowing, readable style that is both interesting and educational for anyone.While varied in appearance cultural habits, all of the tribes shared a profound sense of respect for the environment and a keen knowledge of stewardship for the sustainability of the natural resources they depended on.

The legacy of Rachel Carson's famous work is living on today and is still the nemesis of the chemical industry. It appears that a few chemical snake-oil pushers and/or their apologists have been leaving  bad reviews amongst the mostly  glowing reviews, confirming the success and timeless message of Carson's work long after her passing in 1964.<br /><br />Indeed, *Silent Spring* is still one of the most referenced works when it comes to environment and chemical contamination of the environment. One will understand why after reading this monumental achievement.<br /><br />Ms Carson's work put environment and ecology squarely into our collective consciousness and part of that success is owed, inadvertently,  to the chemical manufacturers who ruthlessly attacked her as a person and the integrity of her work. She was called before congress to testify about the dangers of pesticide/herbicide use and to prove her work while simultaneously being challenged by scientists and chemical manufacturer representatives.<br /><br />The outcome was that chemicals such as DDT, which were wiping-out non-targeted life forms such as the Bald Eagle, were eventually banned from use in the U.S.<br /><br />The controversy over pesticide use stirred-up another important  issue and that was the chemical manufacturers insidious influence of  university-level research. Manufacturers have always funded  university research with rich grants for which they expect data to support their products success in the market-place. Researchers are often coerced by threat of loosing funding or their credibility challenged if their findings are not favorable to industry. Unfortunately, a few of those researchers are gladly willing to take part in this nefarious pseudo-science and seem not to loose any sleep over it.<br /><br />After the backlash of government and public outcry caused by Ms Carson`s efforts, chemical manufacturers to this day think twice before attempting to publicly defame decent/honest chemical detractors, indeed, the possibility of being exposed by the dreaded \\"Silent Spring Syndrome\\" haunts them in a poetic gesture to the memory and work of Rachel Carson.<br /><br />After Ms Carson's exhaustive studies and field work, where the damage of pesticides and herbicides showed their insidious bad habits of spreading beyond target areas, polluting and disrupting biomes, her clear message to the public was simply stated:<br /><br />\\"Now at last, as it has become apparent that the heedless and unrestrained use of chemicals is a greater menace to ourselves than to the targets (bugs), the river which is the science of biotic control flows again, fed by new streams of thought.\\"  (p 279) Indeed!<br /><br />Carson's legacy is enhanced by a host of dedicated people who keep her work not only referenced, but updated and disseminated  through such beautiful books as: Sandra Steingraber's \\"Living Downstream: An Ecologist Looks at Cancer and the Environment\\" and for empathy and understanding of the insect world, there is Joanne E. Lauck's \\"The Voice of the Infinite in the Small: Re-visioning the Insect-Human Connection\\".<br /><br />In 1964, and after Ms Carson died, Robert L. Rudd, a zoologist and expert on the dangers pesticides, published his<br />study: \\"Pesticides and the Living Landscape\\". This work underscored and corraberated the importance Ms Carson's work and showed that many scientists could not be bought or intimidated by the chemical companies.<br /><br />The sad irony of the chemical manufacturer's dangerous assault on insects is that all bugs have a purpose, but then so do the chemical companies: to make a ton of money selling insanity to an unwitting and uneducated public.

This is worth the read and re-read in itself.<br /><br />From Fox himself, there is the \\"Rat Race and Treadmill\\" which underscores our too busy to care dilemma. \\"Similar in many ways to a `busy' man is a zoo animal in it's cage pacing endlessly to and fro, neurotically driven to continue. He might also be compared to a runner driving a treadmill-the activity perpetuates itself, the driver is driven, and he can't get off. The urge to be constantly `doing' is a neurotic compulsion, motivated by its own momentum, by habit, by social competition, greed, and by the fear of failure or loss of status.\\"...and much more. (p 30-). Reminds me of the dog chasing it's own tail, blinding it to all other concerns at the moment. Of course, in the dog's case, it's no harm/no foul; just a silly waste of time.<br /><br />From the Findhorn Garden there is: \\"Though he has dominion over nature, he cannot destroy it without destroying himself. The key to his expression of dominion is first to gain sovereignty of his own nature.\\" (p 46)<br /><br />From Barry Commoner there is: \\"Ecological survival does not mean the abandonment of technology. Rather it requires that technology be derived from a scientific analysis that is appropriate to the natural world on which technology intrudes.\\" (p 37)<br /><br />From Dane Rudhyar: We have reached a state of total crisis of civilization, not only in the West but all over the globe.

This book is a one-stop-shop for all aspects of global warming and is approachable by a general audience.<br /><br />I just knew this would be a good read by his quote from William Shakespeare, The Tempest: \\"HOW CAM'ST THOU IN THIS PICKLE?\\" (page before the index).<br /><br />Indeed! How did we find ourselves in the 21st century- the supposedly enlightened times of vast scientific knowledge about the effects and dynamics of just about everything, sweating-out the rapidly increasing global temperature and it's deleterious effects on all life? Currently, the problem is not science, for as we see in this comprehensive study of global warming, the issue has been on the table for centuries and that part is fascinating!<br />Christianson has done a remarkable job of assembling a wide range of historical data on the effects of global warming from early Europeans to the American Indians and more.<br /><br />The on-set of the industrial revolution kicks the study into high gear and biologist, anthropologist, meteorologist, historians, et al., will no-doubt appreciate the wide perspective.<br /><br />The current debate about whether the daily activities of now billions of humans can alter the climate, let alone environmental processes, has become a ludicrous statement about our collective penchant for denial as the operative factor in approaching (or resisting approaching) this critical stage in our evolution.<br /><br />Of course we can and do effect the climate- 6+ billion of any sizable mammal  can do that and while doing nothing more than breathing, eating and defecating! Of course, we humans do a heck-of-a-lot more. Virtually everything we do creates heat and the worst forms of it are those that contribute to the greenhouse effect by sending heat trapping carbon dioxide into the air.<br /><br />And who is willing to stand-up in the face of a preponderance of historical and current data on human caused global warming, anymore? Looking at those whose activities earn lots of money from producing greenhouse gases certainly have a financial stake in denial, but how about those anthropocentrics who think we humans are infallible and can do no wrong? Sheesh!<br /><br />Whatever camp one is in, this book will demonstrate the science of global warming in all aspects and hopefully, with this knowledge, we begin to do something historically different- alter our ways! Like an ancient Chinese Proverb states, \\"If we do not change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed.\\" And in this case, it's toast!

Thomas Berry does this with eloquence and wisdom here and this is truly, a \\"Great Work\\"! Thank you, Mr. Berry!<br /><br />In his earlier book, \\"The Dream of the Earth\\", Thomas Berry so eloquently stated the need for humanity to realize what a beautiful foundational life-support gift we have in planet Earth and the need to treat it with the profound sense of respect and good stewardship it deserves and needs in to order to provide a healthy life-sustaining platform.<br /><br />An understanding of  the dynamics of Earth's resource cycles and regulatory systems can teach us how to live sustainably and regeneratively- most importantly, carrying that understanding into the formation and dissemination of religion, politics and economy.<br /><br />We see God's handy-work, i.e., the blue prints and operating system for Earth through the dynamics of Nature's regenerative, life providing bounty and  we then see what is required to maintain this perfect system.  Indeed, we are entering the \\"Eco-zoic\\" faze of our existence- the realization and implementation of an ecologically sustainable reality.<br /><br />So how could Berry top that beautiful piece of work? Almost ten years after \\"The Dream\\", he comes out with \\"The Great Work\\", a powerful and compelling continuation of the earlier theme of a beautiful Earth with attentive humans at the helm and with proper stewardship, only now with an exacting historical dialogue of how the Earth formed, settled and eventually became a biological life-support system and where we, as humans have lost our original awe and respect of God's creation through the many distractions of living in a human only, \\"civilized\\" and complex material world, forgetting our interconnectedness to all life.<br /><br />This separation has culminated in an insane, parasitic and cancerous existence  not only for us humans, but for all life on this planet. Isn't it curious that cancer of our bodies is one of our biggest worries and nemesis? Mass over-population, pollution, unsustainable resource use and habitat destruction have left us in a burn-out, dire mess. Our sense of economy is no \\"economy\\" at all, rather a predatory take all shark frenzy fully supported by governments through corporate purchase and manipulation and misguided `human only' pseudo-religious zealotry.<br /><br />An un-Godly, reckless \\"Manifest Destiny\\" attitude of anthropocentric endeavors has been prevailing since the industrialization of our societies exploded on the human scene, blinding us with delusions of superiority, yet to the detriment of our shared and threatened environment.<br /><br />Exactly in the middle of this fine book, is a chapter called<br />\\"Ethics and Ecology\\". Here, Berry relates our combined human sense of making like nothing is wrong on spaceship Earth (a closed-loop eco-system) with a parallel to the tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. A course was set and could not be deviated from, regardless of the warnings of known dangerous icebergs ahead. An attitude that the Titanic was a perfect, fool-proof and unsinkable human manifestation prevailed.<br /><br />The Titanic parallel underscores our misguided human notions that we can control Nature and that we are on a safe course in our activities on Earth. We see our creation of the Titanic (the micro), but not the big picture (the macro), i.e., Nature along with it's icebergs, etc., but especially, the need for our attention to it's requirements for a safe, healthy existence.<br /><br />As Berry states, our  \\"extractive\\" (exploitive, parasitic) economies have become \\"terminal\\" economies (dead-end) and need to be reformulated to sustainable/regenerative economies for the continuation and enjoyment of life- only in a more sane and quality existence.<br /><br />For those that don't think it can be done, it would be educational to look at the turn-around of attitudes and subsequent successes of corporations that have been able to wake-up to what sustainable/regenerative/eco-friendly formats offer in terms of long lasting, profitable returns, let alone peace of mind. A good outline of that can be seen in the book, \\"Natural Capitalism\\" by Hawken and Lovins.<br /><br />Further, religions need to continue with their return to the inclusion of all Creation and away from the current deviation of anthropomorphism. Understanding the dynamics and importance of interconnectedness with all of God's Creation is a matter of survival now and should not be interpreted as \\"Nature Love\\" vs. \\"Biblical Dogma\\". It's all one reality. Berry gently opens our eyes to this!<br /><br />The consideration of an all-inclusive creation- man and nature in harmony instead of man vs. nature- both created by God to coexist, is also touched upon in the 'great work' of Chet Raymo's books \\"Skeptics and True Believers\\", sequealed by his \\"Climbing Brandon\\"- in a sermon by Saint Columbanus, there is in part: [Those who wish to know God, he says, \\"must first review the natural world.\\"].

This is an excellent treatment on the life and science of Leon Focault, the self-taught man who changed the mind of the Catholic Church rather than be persecuted like so many other scientist were for exposing scientific evidence that ran afoul of  the repressive dogma of church doctrine and in that alone, it was a monumental achievement.<br /><br />Using his pendulum, Foucault conclusively proved that the earth rotated on it's axis and around the sun- NOT the Catholic Church. In October of 1992, Pope John Paul II made a public apology to Galileo and  in this, [the apology] \\"...owes everything to the work of Leon Focault almost a century and a half earlier.\\"- p 239.<br /><br />Of course, the apology should have been given directly to Galileo, but hey, better late than never and another feather in the cap of the recently passed John Paul II.<br /><br />Aczel writes with a flowing narrative- \\"like a novelist\\", as one reviewer states, and invites people from all backgrounds to understand the life and accomplishments of Focault and to give due recognition and honor to such a dedicated scientist. Well researched with easy to understand science, including illustrations, photos and drawings, one will come to know the man and his genius.<br /><br />Chief amongst Foucault's many discoveries were the modern electric compass, an electric microscope, photographic technology, insights into color theory, heat waves, and the speed of light. And there was so much more!<br /><br />Before the Preface is a quote from Focault that wisely sums up the import of his pendulum and it's proof of the earth's rotation:<br /><br />\\"The phenomenon develops calmly, but it is invisible, unstoppable. One feels, one sees it born and grow steadily; and it is not in one's power to either hasten or slow it down. Any person, brought into the presence of this fact, stops for a few moments and remains pensive and silent; and then generally leaves, carrying with him forever a sharper, keener sense of our incessant motion through space.\\"- Leon Foucault, 1851.t, 1851.	2005-04-14

Good illustrations help clarify text descriptions. To emphasize the *importance of the compass to navigation*, there is a quote from an English Augustinian monk, Alexander Neckam (1157-1217) from his book, `De Naturis Rerun':<br /><br />\\"The sailors, moreover, as they sail over the sea, when in cloudy weather they can no longer profit by the light of the sun, or when the world is wrapped in the darkness of the shades of night, and they are ignorant to what point of the compass their ship's course is directed, they touch the magnet with a needle. This then whirls round in a circle until, when its motion ceases, its point looks direct to the north.\\" (p 30-31)<br /><br />Aczel opens the story of the \\"Riddle\\" by first relating his childhood memories of growing up on a passenger ship in the Mediterranean where learned how to navigate from his father, the ship's captain. \\"As the years went by, I developed a feel for the compass and the wheel\\" (p 2)<br /><br />This gives him a unique perspective in tracing the origins of the compass and the discovery of magnetism and it's application to the navigational compass. So years later, when he set sail on the journey  to find the origins of the compass, he was first directed to Amalfi, Italy where the first European invention of the compass was supposedly credited to a man named Flavio Gioia in 1302. Although the city of Amalfi boasts of  the discovery of the compass with statues and the like, it doesn't take long to find serious flaws in this legend and the unfolding of that story makes for a fascinating tale in itself.<br /><br />The true history of magnetism and the compass is presented in a fascinating overview that also includes the historical use of the stars, reading of ocean currents, weather and migrating birds that helped early mariners in navigation over the centuries.<br /><br />The Chinese are credited by most historians as being the discoverors of magnetism and this possibly as far back as 1000 BC. They found that magnetic lodestone had an effect on metal and when a piece of spoon-shaped metal was magnetised by it and then placed in water, it always pointed South. Initially, this  discovery was used for divination and land coordinates, but eventually  was adapted to sailing for navigation.<br /><br />From the ancient Chinese, Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Europeans to the modern times, the story of the compass and so much more is thoroughly covered. This is an excellent read!<br /><br />As a companion to Aczel's fine book and for more compass info,  I also recommend \\"The Compass\\" by Paula Z. Hogan, 1980. Although written for children, it is informative and suitable for all ages and backgrounds and in 60 pages, packs more compass facts than any other book I have seen.being the discoverors of magnetism and this possibly as far back as 1000 BC.

I learned about Freddie from a reference in Joanne Elizabeth Lauck's  book, \\"The Voice of the Infinite in the Small\\"- another beautiful treatment of finding empathy for life in all it's marvelous creations- especially bugs.<br /><br />If I hadn't had many of the same incredible experience's with critters that Boone writes about, I could easily have dismissed this stuff as interesting, but hard to believe.

Many books and articles have probed the factual aspects of this amazing land, but no writing to my knowledge conveys so much of the spirit of earth and sky, of plants and people, of storm and the desolation of majestic wastes, of tender, intimate beauty, as does The Land of Little Rain.\\" (Re: \\"A Note on the Land and on the Photographs\\", from \\"The Land of Little Rain\\"- Houghton-Mifflin Co. 1950).<br /><br />Indeed, M.H.A. displayed an uncanny sensitivity and understanding of the desert lands in the Owens Valley, California. Death Valley is, indeed, harsh and unforgiving, but to the astute observer who has learned how to live within the limits of sparse resources, it is an unequaled Paradise. She writes so eloquently and poetically of how the desert people and flora/fauna survive. The interaction of desert botany, biology, hydrology, geography, meteorology, and ecology come across vividly and often humorously with such lines as:<br /><br /> \\"Once at Red Rock, in a year of green pasture (a wet year), which is a bad time for the scavengers, we saw two buzzards, five ravens, and a coyote feeding on the same carrion, and only the coyote seemed ashamed of the company\\". (chapter 3- \\"The Scavengers\\")<br /><br />M.H.A. studied the land, the flora/fauna, the weather (her \\"2\\" basic desert seasons- summer and winter) and she learned from her neighbors the Shoshone and Paiute Indians (she preferred to call the American Indians \\"Amerinds\\") , the Mexicans, the white settlers, and many colorful desert loners such as the \\"Pocket Hunter\\" (for seeker of pockets of gold)- her name for an old  prospector friend. She learned much wisdom and practical knowledge from her Indian friends like \\"The Basket Maker\\", Seyavi, whose life story is so eloquently told. The Indians shared with her their survival knowledge of how to find water from signs displayed by plants, how to read the activities of  animals for food, how to \\"know\\" which plants are medicinal and/or edible and which plants to stay away from:<br /><br />\\"Live long enough with an Indian, and he or the wild things will show you a use for everything that grows in these borders\\". (Chapter- \\"Shoshone Land\\")<br /><br />This beautiful little book finishes with: \\"Come away, you who are obsessed with your own importance in the scheme of things, and have got nothing you did not sweat for, come away by the brown valleys and full-bosomed hills to the even-breathing days, to the kindliness, earthliness, ease of Pueblo de Las Uvas.\\"<br /><br />According to Ansel Adam's notes, Las Uvas is Grape Canyon or Creek and is part of the Tejon area south of Bakersfield, Ca.<br /><br />After reading this fine book, one will come to understand why so many people have referred to M.H.A. as the \\"Henry David Thoreau<br />of the American West\\". Thoreau is the author of the renown classic, \\"Walden\\".<br /><br />There are many different publications of  The Land of Little Rain and many have variations from the original format, ie., different introductions, preface, illustrations, etc. The text is all that really matters, of course, but I have checked-out a few of the different copies from regional libraries so I could copy  the intros by such notables as \\"Cactus Ed\\" (Edward Abbey- \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\", et al.). Abbey's Forward is in the 1988 Penguin Books edition. My copy is a reproduction of the original 1903 edition complete with line drawings by E. Boyd Smith who knew M.H.A. and the regions she wrote about.<br /><br />Ansel Adams teamed-up with Houghton-Mifflin Co. in 1950 to give tribute to this outstanding classic by publishing a version her book with 48 of his photos taken in the Owens Valley, California region where the book was written and M.H.A. lived for sometime.<br /><br />In describing the various areas and geographical locations in her  book, M.H.A. cloaked many of the  popular modern regional names with original Indian or old nicknames known only to a few to protect the privacy of those she wrote about. Adams and the editors used several resources to decipher the pseudonyms so he could match them to his photographs with the current regional names for accurate descriptions. They published an interesting glossary of all the names that could be deciphered in this 1950 edition.<br /><br />More information including photographs of M.H.A. and her life can be seen at the Owens Valley Historical Society website:<br />[...]popular modern regional names with original Indian or old nicknames known only to a few to protect the privacy of those she wrote about.

We are treated to a fascinating, revealing, serious study of human ecology interlaced with humor and insight that only a first rate, dedicated zoologist could provide. Chapters cover our human peculiarities of origin, sex, anatomy, child rearing, exploration/innovation, fighting, feeding, comfort; relations to all other animals and environment; population management or rather, our serious lack of it; and amazingly, even that special peculiarity of humans- language, religion, politics and economics along with insights into the serious lack of efficacy in our endeavors.<br /><br />This is a true, bare to the bones, scientifically detached observation of the human animal and makes no apologies for \\"exposing\\" us in our varied and peculiar habits. An excellent eye-opening read, truly educational and enlightening!<br /><br />For those who are interested in biology, sociobiology, ecology, etc., will no doubt enjoy what can be seen as a large expansion on Morris' theme in the book: \\"Mammal in the Mirror\\" by the daughter and father science team of David and Ilona Barrash.

The focus of this book is spas, health retreats, baths and drinking water- and that's great, but there is so much more!<br /><br />The many posters, photos, renown paintings and drawings are well chosen and beautiful and makes this book a beautiful table top addition.<br /><br />Ms Croutier states that \\"...I was born under the sign of Aquarius-the Water Bearer-in a house facing the sea... and now living in a house facing another sea\\". No wonder she shows such remarkable sensitivity to the subject.<br /><br />All through the book are quotes, lines and poetry from notables throughout history regarding their observations on the value and dynamics of water. In the Preface for instance, there is: [\\"As Benjamin Franklin's `Poor Richard's Almanac' observes: \\"When the well's dry, we know the worth of water\\".] and in Ms Croutier's own words: \\"Water has it's own language. I believe that by observing the ways that people have danced with it throughout history, we can gain a deeper awareness of this most precious element. A responsible appreciation of water is fundamental to our ecological, environmental, and spiritual values.\\" Well put and what a \\"dance\\" she portrays!<br /><br />From Hegel: \\"Water is the element of selfless contrast, it passively exists for others... water's existence is thus an existing-for-others... Its fate is to be something not yet<br /><br />specialized... and therefore it soon came to be called `the mother of all that is special'.\\" (p 13)<br /><br />On page 14 in \\"Myths of Creation\\" is: \\"Among ancient civilizations, water was sanctified as the source of life, the seminal fluid, the juice of the earth's womb. It formed a common thread in their creation myths. The act of creation was perceived by the primitives as the catharsis of a dance that the great deities performed. These deities were the elements, inseparable and interdependent systems orchestrating the cycles of nature, the seasons, and the sustenance of all beings. Water could not exist without earth, fire, or air.\\"<br /><br />From the Kogi Indians (spelled Cogui in this book), who live in the Columbian mountains, comes an admonition to the world about the abuse of water and environmental degradation: [\\"What is water?\\" Water is life itself.]  To the Kogi, the word for water and spirit are the same.

From early indigenous peoples to Socrates and beyond, Abrams takes us on a journey in time to find where the disconnect from Nature begins and spells it out not only in terms of the first \\"civilized\\" humans, but also how  language began to sophisticate, yet distance itself and us from that part of Nature reality or \\"life-world\\" when we knew where our sustenance and life support came from and we had a more direct and reverent sensibility of it.<br /><br />Realizing the dynamics of the disconnection leads us back to the reconnection and is seen in many passages throughout this book such as: \\"SO THE RECUPERATION OF THE INCARNATE, SENSORIAL DIMENSION of experience brings with it a recuperation of the living landscape in which we are corporeally embedded. As we return to our senses, we gradually discover our sensory perceptions to be simply our part of a vast, interpenetrating webwork of perceptions and sensations borne by countless other bodies- supported that is, not just by ourselves, but by icy streams tumbling down granitic slopes, by owl wings and lichens, and by the unseen, imperturbable wind.\\" (p 65)<br /><br />\\"The earthly terrain in which we find ourselves, and upon which we depend for all our nourishment, is shot through with suggestive scrawls and traces, from the sinuous calligraphy of rivers winding across the land, inscribing arroyos and canyons into the parched earth of the desert, to the black slash burned by lightning into the trunk of an old elm.\\" (p 95)<br /><br />\\"THE SENSE OF BEING IMMERSED IN A SENTIENT WORLD IS preserved in the oral stories and songs of indigenous peoples- in the belief that sensible phenomena are all alive and aware, in the assumption that all things have the capacity of speech. Language, for oral peoples, is not a human invention but a gift from the land itself.\\" (p 262-3)<br /><br />This beautiful book is full of such passages  and I keep it handy for continuous reference and enjoyment- it is one of the most marked-up and highlighted books in my possession.

This book looks something like a cross between a collegiate textbook and a beautiful coffee table art book. The art work in the many illustrations is superb and along with fine photos and graphs depicting Earth's many life cycle systems, easily and clearly describes what a self-regulating life support system is and looks like.<br /><br />The text is comprehensive and complete, yet does not overwhelm. After reading this book, if one still does not believe that Earth is a self regulating life support system, one will at least admire this very compelling dissertation. One need keep in mind that at the very basics of self regulation is the fact that the Earth has maintained it's life supporting oxygen level of about 21% for over a billion years. More oxygen and we're toast; not enough and we suffocate.<br /><br />Earth formed, cooled and then microscopic life developed in the oceans. Ranging on or near the surface of the ocean, tiny one-celled phytoplankton, through the process of photosynthesis,  produce oxygen and also trap a significant amount of carbon dioxide which has been identified as a significant contributor to global warming.<br /><br />With the land forests of the world being cut down at an alarming rate, phytoplankton are, once again, becoming a primary supplier of oxygen. The delicate balance between land and ocean environs is needed to regulate not only the carbon/oxygen balance, but also, to help regulate the weather and Lovelock, et al., give a compelling argument for implementing corrective measures to help restore that balance.<br /><br />When we understand life cycle processes and understand what we as humans are doing to upset and alter them, we then have a sense of which direction to go in order to alter our life styles and bad environmental habits. So this book covers the entire spectrum from a discourse in Earth life support cycles to avenues of approach to Healing Gaia. My hats off to Lovelock and his staff for creating this masterpiece.<br /><br />I have only seen one other book that approaches this caliber of discourse on Gaia and that is: \\"The Seven Mysteries of Life\\" by Guy Murchie. The title is somewhat misleading because the gist of the book is very similar to Healing Gaia- and no mystery, really, just a good dissertation on Earth`s life cycles. As with Lovelock, Murchie (a meteorologist) was also inspired to write his book  about a self-regulating life support system and the interconnectivity of all life while contemplating  the beautiful view of Earth from space.reating this masterpiece.

Very appropriately, other reviews have started with a heart felt admiration and thanks to Bradley Dean and all of his associates for this monumental accomplishment of editing and bringing this \\"Last Manuscript\\" to fruition.  No easy task, either. Included in this book are photo copies of  original handwritten pages from the manuscript.  Think  of  the proverbial Doctor's scribbling and you get the picture. The research required to make sense of it all and get it to book form was monumental. Also included is an overview of  how this project was handled with significant editor's notes and further research info and a chronology of Thoreau's life. For more info on Thoreau's life and work, there is a note to readers that invites all to check out the Walden Project or the Thoreau Society website ([...]<br /><br />This book mostly reads like a botanist's field guide to wild edible plants with very exacting seasonal attributes: uses- edible, medicinal, etc.; locating/identifying/gathering/processing. Fine plant illustrations by Abigail Rorer compliment the plant descriptions.<br /><br />Added to this and sprinkled throughout the book are Thoreau's thoughts and keen insight to the workings of nature and the need of the public to be educated on the virtues of native flora/fauna. Thoreau posits on the need for large tracks of land (like nature islands) to be set aside in their pristine/untouched/native condition for the protection and health of plant and animal life.<br /><br />This book is not a sequel to  Thoreau`s \\"Walden\\", rather, it stands on it's own as a great illustration of his profound knowledge of flora/fauna and for his admiration and love of Nature for all that it provides- \\"To watch for, describe, all the divine features which I detect in Nature. My profession is to be always on the alert to find God in nature-to know his lurking places\\". Thoreau certainly lived up to that aspiration and more! I highly recommend this book.	2005-04-03

By the time this book was published in 1990, the population had increased to 5.3 billion. The current population is well over 6 billion. Because of the now virtually straight-up growth curve, we are breeding ourselves off the planet. Match this curve with the increasing consumption of fossil fuel and resulting carbon dumping, ozone depletion, rain forest destruction, sewage pollution in the land and oceans- all contributing to global warming; toxic chemicals seeping into ground water supplies; accelerated depletion of fish stocks; widespread famine, etc., and we now have a real environmental pan of worms on our hands. What commentary is it on major governments (esp. the supposedly civilized U.S.) and religious groups to resist human population management and education? Is this their idea of love, compassion and wisdom?<br /><br />The extreme  conditions of poverty, pollution, crime and poor health, all resulting in global human/flora/fauna suffering and misery, one would think, should motivate  global efforts to inform on and correct this mess. Or are we humans just not intelligent enough to heed the loud and compelling warnings of  the Ehrlich's and others that we need to take seriously our \\"Population Bomb\\"? The data and message in this fine book is as timely now as when it was first published- just more urgent!<br /><br />In 1970 the Ehrlich's published one of the finest textbooks on human ecology: \\"Population, Resources, Environment\\". It is still relevant and informative today- just add more people and pollution to the mix and you've brought it up to speed.<br /><br />As many others have observed, by not taking any constructive action we are letting nature  take it's course. Is this our legacy? Will the cockroaches and fleas, who have managed to flourish in our human mess and who will probably be here long after we're gone, write our epitaph: Those stupid humans sure were fun while they were here.

Although brought up in Catholicism, Raymo was later schooled in science (physics and astronomy) and has been attempting to rectify the rifts between religion and science ever since. This he does just about as good or better than anyone.  In \\"Skeptics and True Believers\\", one will find  close parallels to the writing of environmentalist Thomas Berry,  biologist E.O. Wilson, et al.<br /><br />Raymo's writing style is lyrical, poetic, anecdotal, scholarly and very insightful- most of all, compelling. One will find this book full of great citations with his own thoughts thrown in, such as: [\\"Put on your jumping shoes,\\" cried the fourteenth-century mystic Meister Eckhart, \\"which are intellect and love.\\" Religion without science is idolatrous. Science without religion might be even more dangerous: amoral power without constraint, without wisdom, without love.] Indeed! And Raymo's take on reductionism: \\"No theory conceived by the human mind will ever be final. The universe is vast, marvelous, and deep beyond our knowing; its horizons will always recede before our advance. All dreams of finality are (probably) futile.\\"<br /><br />Although skeptical of the efficacy of some of  Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's conclusions in the \\"Phenomenon of Man\\", he concurs with him with: [He insisted that the surest way  to know God is through his creation, and the truest knowledge of creation is that provided by contemporary science. \\"Less and less do I see any difference now between research and adoration.\\"]. And with that, keep in mind that Teilhard was a French Benedictine Monk and  paleontologist /geologist who often ran afoul of the church for his thoughts, so he left his works to a friend in the U.S. to be published posthumously.<br /><br />Although I read this great work of Raymo's almost 2 years ago, I was inspired to write this review after reading his latest book, \\"Climbing Brandon\\" which is a continuation of his efforts to balance religion and science and he wrote that book while residing at his second home on Ireland's Dingle Peninsula near the foot of Mt.

Duane Elgin has compiled a fairly complete and comprehensive outline of the  evolution of human consciousness and the direction we are headed and therefore, the drastic and immediate changes humans need to make to insure survival of life on our beautiful, but vulnerable planet Earth. I'll borrow  a simple, but profound Ancient Chinese Proverb Elgin included in his book: \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\" to emphasize the need for humans to realize the slippery slope to disaster we are on and the need to alter course:<br /><br />\\"If we don't change our direction, we are likely to end up where we are headed\\"- Indeed!<br /><br />Elgin doesn't just dwell on the negative without proffering ideas, means and ways to clean up our collective human act, rather, most all of his energy is poured into answers and ideas for human lifestyle changes that are sustainable and healthy. All of his publications are guidelines to sane, harmonious living. And this can be seen in another fine, eloquent book of his: \\"Promise Ahead\\".<br /><br />\\"Awakening Earth\\" outlines the on-going poll seen at his website about what stage of maturation and consciousness is humanity at: \\"What Life Stage of the Human Family\\". There are four choices: Toddler, Teenager, Adult or Elder. The poll has maintained it's choice percentages for several years at about 74% for Teenager and about 21% for Toddler- not much left for the Adult or Elder category. After reading Elgin's books, one might be inclined to see him as one of the Elders.<br /><br />The  importance in Human Maturation was the focus of a very simple, eloquent, but potent book published in 1947 by H.A. Overstreet: \\"The Mature Mind\\" which became an international bestseller and I found it is as profound and timely as Elgin's important work.<br /><br />Also paralleling Elgin's theme here is Thomas Berry's book \\"The Great Work', a profound message of the dire need for a human alteration of it's accepted norm for compatibility in a more humane and civilized world that acknowledges God's gift of Nature as the basis and guiding force in all of our transactions with life.basis and guiding force in all of our transactions with life.	2005-03-31

As in his book: \\"Skeptics and True Believers\\",  his continuing search for harmony between religion and science leading to universal admiration and awe of God's creation, he writes a compelling argument for removing the detritus of dogma and the sterility of science-  not that easy for a person who was brought up on Catholicism and schooled in science (physics, astronomy) where he started to articulate his personal misgivings about strict dogma and contradictions.<br /><br />Climbing Brandon was written at his part time home in Ireland on the Dingle Peninsula  near the foot Mt Brandon where pilgrims/tourist come from all parts of the world to walk the paths and visit the contemplation centers of long passed saints and monks, i.e., St Patrick, Brendan, et al.<br /><br />With  geographical  descriptions, especially those garnered from  various view points  in the surrounding mountains where past contemplatives meditated/prayed, poetical/prayerful/anecdotal/scholarly treatments of Irish/Celtic religious history, including numerous citations, this beautiful book comes off as part: Travel Guide (and watch out- after reading this book, one might be compelled to drop everything and go tour the region!), a crash course in Irish/Celtic cultural history (Paganism, Pantheism, Christianity, etc.), Religio/Science dissertation, etc.<br /><br />The premise that God is in all and not the exclusive property of humans (anthropomorphism)  is cited in an early Irish poem attributed to one of the \\"Milesian\\" princes, Amergin: \\"Song of Amergin\\" or \\"The Mystery\\".

Same notion as in the sermon of St Columbanus which ends with: [Those who wish to know God, he says,] \\"must first review the natural world\\".

River Needs All the Help It Can Get	This book is done in a table top format and should be within reach at all times- at least for all Angelinos and natural flowing river advocates. It is not a scholarly treatment and not meant to be, rather, it is an anecdotal effort to bring awareness of the *existence* of the river  and bring people up to speed via a quick overview of the history and current affairs of the river. This is accomplished with good text and photos by Patt Morrison (Los Angeles Times columnist, extraordinaire) and Mark Lamonica (a great photographer).<br /><br />It is ironic that the first Europeans settled and founded Los Angeles *because* of the river, never mind the Indians that were here first and had revered the river for centuries for it's life providing qualities, yet in so many years and due to huge population growth, demands for ever increasing water volume caused people to start looking elsewhere, ie., wells, lake diversions, catch-basins, etc. The river became a nuisance from it's pesky habit of changing it's course through periodic floods and then ran dry for much of the year. Eventually, the river was channeled and turned into a huge concrete drainage ditch- not a pretty site. Access to the river was fenced-off, so it pretty much became ignored. Well, not quite.<br /><br />Very dedicated people (including Patt Morrison) have been drawing attention to the river and calling for it's revitalization as a river complete with native flora/fauna. \\"Friends of the L.A. River\\" is one such group and there are many more. There are significant stretches of the river that have been rehabilitated to a more natural and original condition and many would love to see this happen over the entire 51 mile run it makes from the headwaters in the San Fernando Valley all the way to Long Beach where it meets the Pacific Ocean- and this is doable! The river just needs more attention drawn to it and that is the essence of this book.<br /><br />If anyone wants a more scientific (hydrology, meterology, etc.), scholarly and historically fact filled book about the river, check out what most people refer to as the definitive science and history of the river: \\"The Los Angeles River: It's Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth\\" by Blake Gumprecht (Patt Morrison references it in her book).

My hint stated which 'haystack' that 'needle' is in, but nothing specific- my apologies, anyway! That said, I'll explain the 'deja vu' in my review title.<br /><br />In the late summer of 1970, I was on a journey that passed through the region where many of the featured houses are located and was blessed with the aquaintance of many people who owned and/or built these homes. My intention was to travel to Washington State as quickly as possible, but I was so blown away by the beautifully hand crafted houses and the nice people who owned them, that I stayed in the area for a few months partaking of the generous hospitality they offered. I have helped build houses, designed and built furniture, but I was awed by the craftsmanship and love poured into these homes. The title of the book is \\"Handmade Houses\\" and let me emphasize that title by saying that many of these structures were put together with material hand hewn (no power tools) from the immediate area and in some cases, homes were built without one nail pounded- wood joints only.<br /><br />Other featured houses were artfully assembled from materials salvaged from torn down buildings. I helped out in procuring some of the materials and was amazed by the careful procedures to safley dismantle the structures and process them for inclusion on \\"new\\" buildings. Mismatched windows, doors, etc., made for some neat eclectic blendings. Tree branches, metal sculptings, plumbing/lighting, etc., were also artfully blended in.<br /><br />OK, NOW here comes the 'deja vu'. In 1977, I was perusing a book shop and saw this book upside-down. On the backcover is photo of a beautifully crafted outhouse and I immediately recognized it. \\"Man, I've been here before!\\" It's on one of the many properties I visited and stayed at. The front window/door looks out over a beautiful valley with a river running through it- what a view! Page after page has photos of many of the houses I was lucky enough to visit and many more, so this book has been a beautiful reminder of that experience- thanks to Art Boericke and Barry Shapiro for putting this beautiful photojourney together- I've been enjoying it for years!<br /><br />The color photos are first rate and give both inside and outside views. This is not a how-to book and has no floor plans- that would detract somewhat from the artsy, eclectic format, anyway.<br /><br />The book forward is by the famous eco-architect, Sim Van der Ryn of Sausalito, California- a heck of craftsman/architect/ecologist himself and the author of such books as \\"The Toilet Papers: Recycling Waste and Conserving Water\\"- a great over-view of the history and current methods of waste mitigation and water conservation.  Included in this book are methods of ecologically sound waste disposal for homes that want to do on-sight waste biodegration.

In the concrete covered human world that has distanced itself from Nature and realitiy, we are daily subjected to the perverse messages delivered through commercials by profit greedy pesticide companies about the nasty, stinging, dirty, disease carryings bugs. By now, though, we should all be able to see through that snake-oil facade, but how about the \\"bad bug\\" disinformation passed along by good intentioned, but uninformed teachers, parents, et al?<br /><br />Lauck's \\"Voice of the Infinite\\" covers all the bases of the intentional to the inadvertant adverse propaganda campaigns against insects and goes much further by introducing us to their beautiful world- bug by bug. Reading this book will let you \\"walk\\" with bugs and hear their song. Unless one's heart is stone cold, one will come to know exactly what empathy and admiration for insects is all about.<br /><br />What is the purpose of a bug as annoying as a flee or mosquito? Read this book! You still might not want to hang out with them, but you will most likely see them in a different and less antagonistic light. Those who have embraced the wisdom and insight of Rachel Carson's book, \\"Silent Spring\\", will certainly enjoy Joanne Elizabeth Lauck's book.<br /><br />And another beautiful tale of finding admiration and empathy for critters is mentioned in Lauck's book and that is: J. Allen Boone's \\"Kinship With All Life\\", the true story about \\"Freddie\\" the fly. This book is the story of Boone finding mental connections to Freddie and all other animals. Thanks to Ms Lauck for referencing that book!	2005-03-25

While written in 1947, this potent book is timeless and wise beyond measure; a book that would do well as important reading in all schools and in all nations, perhaps a universal class called: \\"Maturity 101\\".<br /><br />At the time of publication, this book was a national and international best seller. After reading it, one will see why. It stayed in the #1 slot until the publication of the \\"Kinsey Report\\" one year later- Prof. Alfred Kinsey's, et al., block-buster science report on human sexual habits.<br /><br />Overstreet gives us such gems as: [\\"All children, Diderot once observed, are essentially criminal. It is merely our good luck that their physical powers are still too limited to permit them to carry out their destructiveness.\\" Had he lived today, Diderot might have expanded his remark. He might have said that all childish minds are dangerous, but particularly when those minds are housed in adult bodies; for then they have the power to put their immaturities fully and disastrously into effect.\\"]- i.e., war mongering, wanton destruction of our shared environment, destructive relationships, selfishness in politics and business, etc. Here, begins the message of the critical need for children to be taught socialization (including sex education), care and awe of nature, love of self, family, community, etc.<br /><br />\\"The Mature Mind\\" brings up many of the more contemporary ideas of universal maturing of consciousness put forth in Duane Elgin's books: \\"Awakening Earth\\", \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\", et al.<br /><br />I rate \\"The Mature Mind\\" as one of the most important books in history and in these times of contentious unrest, environmental destruction, socio-economic-religious-political predation, the message about the importance of human maturation cannot be overstated.	2005-03-14

Some researchers have used polygraph instruments connected to leaf surfaces to observe responses through electro-magnetic activity  to various stimuli such as: raucous, loud music compared with mellow, harmonious music. The results are always the same: plants react favorably to mellow music while continuous raucous sounds can actually kill them. Even more amazingly,  perhaps, is that plants accurately react to good or bad thoughts directed at them or other biological life forms and even at great distances.<br /><br />Perhaps the most profound discovery of all of this plant research, however, is that plants are truly sentient beings capable of a multitude and range of feelings. Many skeptics have been astonished to discover this fact, but since this phenomena can be demonstrated using relatively simple tests, it is there for anyone to prove it on their own.<br /><br />Masaru Emoto, a researcher in Japan, has come to the conclusion that sentient life is found in just about all life forms including water, which is the focus of his research. In his book, \\"The Hidden Message in Water\\", Emoto tells of using some of the same studies to demonstrate that ice crystals formed from various frozen water samples, show a sentient response to the same stimuli that the plants have been subjected to and  with the same results.<br /><br />This book references a broad spectrum of researchers such as Rachel Carson, author of the famous  \\"Silent Spring\\"-1962. This book was a powerful indictment of chemical pesticides, herbicides, etc. and  which was considered to be the biggest boost to environmental awareness that continues on to this day. She  wrote about the alarming side effects of  chemical contamination and the ludicrous, unnecessary vicious cycle of ever expanding need for more chemicals while plants and insects, unlike most other life-forms,  so expertly alter their composition to resist this assault. Of course, the chemical manufacturers (aka: merchants of poison and death) are laughing all the way to the bank with this dangerous and insidious snake-oil scam.<br /><br />After reading this book, one might feel a sense of rage about the assault of  the thoughtless and needless use of toxic chemicals used on plant and insects, overflowing into all other life forms, wreaking havoc on non-targeted ecosystems. But,  what goes around, comes around (Karma, and in this case, bad).<br /><br />The book finishes with the founding story of the Findhorn Community in Scotland, an ecologically conscious horticultural group who started their project with the full awareness that plants are sentient and in this harsh land, would need more than just good organic farming techniques- they would also need continuous positive mental feed-back from their human caretakers. Findhorn has been a resounding success and is now a highly regarded learning center.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, \\"this book should be read by every human on the planet\\" and hopefully, all will come to appreciate the multitude of life-providing services that plants bestow on humanity.nmental awareness that continues on to this day.

This is a note of thanks to the late, great Guy Murchie<br />for \\"Seven Mysteries\\". It impressed me as one of the most sensitive, insightful and profound journeys into what constitutes life from the micro to the macro and it left with me a much deeper appreciation for the awesome dynamics of life. It is science: microbiology to astronomy, mythology, philosophy and so much more. Murchie was a dynamic, wide-ranging thinker and \\"Mysteries\\" is his masterpiece of  an abundance of accumulated knowledge.<br /><br />His prose range from easy, flowing science to lyrical, poetic musings on the dynamics of life. He does not overwhelm, yet runs deep into thoughtful observation and meditation producing wise assessments on matters at hand before moving on, indeed,  he is building to a complete, unification theory of life and he takes his time- it's necessary for the eventual summation.<br /><br />All through the book are beautiful, intricate line drawings artfully rendered by Murchie. He included illustrations of everything from microscopic life-forms (diatoms, etc.) to renderings of  representative  life-forms in the evolutionary tree, etc., and then on to the macro astronomical vistas and all with amazing detail.<br /><br />Although \\"Mysteries\\" predates James Lovelock's \\"Healing Gaia\\", it was constructed from the same inspiration garnered from the beautiful view of our \\"Blue Planet Earth\\" from space.<br /><br />As with Lovelock and many others, Murchie viewed the Earth as a living, self regulating, life support system and  his science to support that notion is as good as it gets.<br /><br />After Murchie's exacting description of physical/biological life as we know it, he then goes on to examine one of his favorite subjects: music- harmonious sounds created by the movement and vibration of physical objects. This, by the way, is the subject of another earlier book of his, \\"The Music of the Spheres\\".<br /><br />The book finishes with a poetic summary of  the *seven mysteries*: Abstraction, Interrelation, Omnipresence, Polarity, Transcendence, Germination, and Divinity.<br /><br />All through the book, Murchie is preparing us for a compelling sense of intentionality in the dynamics and purpose of life and he does this as good or better than just about anyone. If  I had to give up all my books but one, \\"Seven Mysteries\\" would be the one- the keeper!Transcendence, Germination, and Divinity.

Hogan writes mostly for children- this book is rated for the 9-12 age group although people from all age groups and educational backgounds will no doubt admire the ground Hogan covers. The info is short, to the point and well researched. There are fun and simple experiments to illustrate magnetic field phenomena and good illustrations depicting the long history of the compass.<br />I rated this book as a 5 star because it goes way beyond what one would expect from a book for children. The history of the compass is well presented and very complete with fascinating tidbits of information from ancient China to present day use.<br />Over 2,000 years ago the Chinese discovered the magnetic qualities of lodestone, which they referred to as \\"tzu shih\\" or loving stones and they learned that metal magnetized by loadstone and balanced on a peg or floated in water, always pointed to the south. Land bearings could be established with this object. But it was possibly the Phoenecians who first used this discovery as an aid to ship navigation and using the north heading.<br />Eventually and over many centuries, the compass reached Greece,Italy and then England and it was here that the compass was not only perfected, but also, the phenomenon of magnetism and why it works was discovered. I admire Hogan for packing so much relevant info into a compact format!	2003-09-27
