Six brothers have been turned into swans by their wicked stepmother. Only their sister, Sorcha, can save these sons of an Irish chieftain by weaving magical shirts that will turn them back into human beings. As she begins her task in the forest, she is raped and forced to flee . . . and then her adventure begins.&#34;<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />I'm not familiar with the &#34;famous&#34; fairytale this is based off of and it is my first book from the author but not the last. My wife and I read it together and we both couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The writing is engaging and creates a wonderful mood.<br /><br />The characters draw you into their lives and you are moved through emotions as you read about family, sacrifice, love, honor, friendship and loyalty.<br /><br />The author knows how to build good suspense and though you can guess what is going to happen I appreciated the author not rushing things but timing it all very well.<br /><br />This first book in the trilogy could be read independent of the series and resolves 98% of all conflicts within the story. Thus you aren't left feeling forced to get book two right away (but you'll want to).<br /><br />I personally am tired of female protagonists that are super gorgeous and can also wield a shot-gun in one hand while sewing mittens with the other. I was pleasantly surprised that this is not one of those types of protagonists. She has her failings (she's only 12 - 13 yrs of age) and her exceptional strengths (specialized training due to her unique upbringing).<br /><br />OVERALL: Get the book whether you like Celtic fairytales or just a fantasy lover this was a very enjoyable and engaging read for both my wife and I (she kept crying through parts) and we are definitely returning to the works of this author.	2005-08-22

She states her points, gives an example then tells you what page the template is on so you can fill in your own. Efficient and not a waste of my time<br /><br />3) Like any novel writing program, if you stick with it you'll get it done. So if you go this route, do it from beginning to end and supplment the sections that you feel need extra help. For instance, in handling the character sub-plots I would combine her section with the Marshall Plan of Novel Writing's discussion and format for sub-plots<br /><br />A very good book. Another plan that makes it look doable if one simply commits to writing.	2005-07-20

Otherwise I had no major complaints<br /><br />4) Some unanswered questions but none too major that I hated the ending<br /><br />Overall I really liked the book for the less mentally challenged reading that can just be enjoyed for the adventure.

MY STORY: National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) 2004 started on Nov 1st of that year. It was Nov. 2nd when I remembered the event had started, so I grabbed a pre-existing novel idea/outline and jumped into the unknown. Nine days later and my discovery writing method produced only 7,000 new words. I was done. I had failed. I felt like an idiot for having started late; plus thinking I could write 50,000 words with only an idea in my pocket and some excitement for this new challenge.<br /><br />I chatted with a couple of people who said they spent two weeks prior doing story outlines and character drafts and that helped them finish, which only made me feel worse about my &#34;unpreparedness&#34;. I quickly justified my own failure with a ton of lame excuses and within an hour or two of quitting I treated myself to some chocolate-chip cookies, almost guilt-free.<br /><br />Before the 2005 NaNoWriMo I got my hands on this book. Chris Baty totally made me feel like I could have and should have stuck with it in 2004, regardless of how far behind I was by day nine. This book made me laugh, made me cry, and made me feel inspired to take this challenge every month between November 2004 and November 2005. I got motivated! I read the book in a day -- which is fast for me -- and I left with more things to think about than things forgotten.<br /><br />Too often books on writing talk about starting with note cards, then story boarding, then move into characters, etc. (still a lot of value in that by the way!) But, as I read this book, I was reading about a crazy approach of simply writing your story, then &#34;fixing&#34; and figuring out all that other stuff after the fact.<br /><br />At the time, it was is mind-blowing and backwards to all the other writing advice books out there. BUT the more you examine the process (and see the thousands who have completed the challenge) belief takes root that it is possible for everyone to write a novel. . .if they want to. This book helped me realize I may not write a &#34;good&#34; novel in 30-days, but write 50,000 words of a first draft in 30-days was totally within my ability to do.<br /><br />The book contains great advice for surviving the four weeks and there are many tips that I don't want to share any spoilers. You simply need to read the book for yourself and then take the challenge.<br /><br />I know now that I'm more prepared, due to a bit of direction found in this easy to read and entertaining book.<br /><br />**Updated NOTES**<br />I still refer to this book each year. Since first reading this book I have succeed in completing this monthly challenge in 2005 through 2009, then again 2011 through 2015.<br /><br />Like 2015, I'm approaching 2016 with trepidation because, I'm yet again, a returning college student and my courses are no joke. . .plus. . .I'm the sole provider for our family and a dozen other commitments. What makes NaNoWriMo less daunting is having a plan (before November) and using the tips found in this book (during November). Thus, I know, based on previous year success, that it is still very doable!<br /><br />For me, the biggest tip the book gives -- that I still use year after year -- is Chris' suggestion of how to punch out 6K words in one session.<br /><br />Please realize, NaNoWriMo is not about putting down discovery writers or outline writers. Both can succeed with this challenge.<br />But for me personally, I find myself able to punch out 50K words a lot faster and easier when I have a scene-by-scene outline. It took a while for me to let my discovery writing days go by the wayside, but once I saw the results in sheer number of new words on paper due to outlining, I haven't looked back.<br /><br />Also,  I've taken the essence of this book and when November 1st comes around I've written to my outline; not letting the internal editor stop me. This is the CORE of the book...not so much being a discovery writer vs. outliner, but a writer who doesn't stop to edit for the duration of the challenge.<br /><br />Good luck to all those getting ready of 2016 NaNoWriMo.<br /><br />Get the book. It's worth it!!or the duration of the challenge.<br /><br />Good luck to all those getting ready of 2016 NaNoWriMo.<br /><br />Get the book. It's worth it!!	2005-06-17

As Ezzaria's only remaining Warden, he carries the entire burden of the worsening demon war on his shoulders, and some Ezzarian elders have set a watch on him to make sure he has not brought some subtle corruption back from his years in slavery. Then a demon encounter unlike any in Ezzarian memory leads Seyonne to question everything he has ever believed. And his search for a demon-possessed child becomes the search for his own soul and the soul of his people.&#34;<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) First 150 pages and last 100 pages were just as great as the first book in the series<br /><br />2) This book suffers from the syndrome of many middle books of trilogies. . .the 250 pages in the middle lagged. In order to keep the story fuller, the middle is stretched out in my opinion more for marketing purposes than needing to reveal any more to us the nature of Seyonne or the plot in general. Don't get me wrong: The middle is still well written but the story definitely seems to slow dramatically. The good news is the middle doesn't lag as bad as some of the books in Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series (Bk5 was awful)<br /><br />3) We learn more about characters introduced in Bk1 and have some new likeable characters introduced here. The interaction is believable and you root for some and wish fireballs from the sky to land on others<br /><br />4) I'm still middle-of-the-fence on the author's description of the demon world and its society. Not sure if I like it, can believe it or what<br /><br />5) Again I appreciate how the sex and profanity are handled professionally without getting unnecessarily graphic. Things are hinted to but nothing is ever shown, which leaves more for the story to progress.<br /><br />OVERALL: A better than good book, but because it suffers from 2nd book syndrome it wasn't a great book.<br />Even with the 2nd book troubles this is one of my top 10 favorite fantasy series to date.

No elves or dwarves or other \\"cooki-cutter\\" elements.<br /><br />Second praise is due to what the author calles Charter Magic. A form of rune magic, the author creates a form of magic that is powerful but also has its limitations.<br /><br />Third praise is the world he creates is vivid and imaginable. The conflict between the living and the dead is nicely handled.<br /><br />Fourth praise is because the characters were interesting. Sabriel the protagonist I was envisioning as a 12-14 year old but towards the end she says she is 18 years old. Either 12 or 18, she is mature for her age but I understood this to be because of her unique background and raising.<br /><br />Final praise is due to content. Not overly violent or gory and little if no sex. Marketed in several book stores as a young adult fantasy, this was appropriate for teens. I'd rather a teen read this than the content found in the ever popular Drangonlance or Forgotten Realms books.<br /><br />Overall, it was a refreshing read in the midst of the 20+ mediocre books I read last year. This book really hit a note with me and I'd recommended it to any fantasy lover...and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.	2005-02-15

I liked how the book has a nice summary of the previous six books. Though his stories are deep and involved to the point where a summary cannot do them justice, it was still nice to get some reminders of &#34;what has come before&#34; (as the chapter is so titled)<br /><br />2. Linden as the main protagonist is believable and as expected with Donaldson's characters, not always likable though we feel for her at the same time.<br /><br />3. The rest of the cast is complex and interesting as usual. What shines is how he depicts how the Land has changed and how the races who live there have changed over the hundreds of years that have passed since Linden was last in the Land.<br /><br />4. What I felt dragged the story terribly is that every second we have to jump into Linden's thoughts instead of move the story along. Especially in the first 100 pages I just kept SCREAMING, because after the umpteenth time of jumping into her thoughts, I already get it that she is deeply and emotionally involved with Thomas Covenant and those feelings drive the rest of her. The constant STOPPAGE to the story to PAUSE for Linden's thoughts did not end even to last several pages. Darn!<br /><br />5. For me the story didn't take off till page 325. We finally get the bigger picture of what tasks/quests lie ahead for her and her companions and they start to do something about it. Thus, you need to stick with the book past this to let the story finally move along at a more regular pace.<br /><br />OVERALL: Donaldson is a gifted writer and his imagery is fantastic. If he would have pulled back and not spent so much of the book sharing every single thought of Linden's I would have rated it higher. Nice intro to what is to come as far at the series plot, but I just hope he picks up the pace in the upcoming books.tastic.

All characters (even Woofer, a dog who plays an important role) are fully voiced<br /><br />CHARACTERS &iexcl;V Protagonists are the grey type of characters that leave you liking them but also not liking them at the same time. Some of the &iexcl;§minor&iexcl;¨ protagonists are much more likeable as we feel for their helpless plight. Bad guy is evil and it makes sense why he does the things he does. I really liked the bad guy concept, sort of a melding of genres (can&iexcl;¦t say too much more without giving it away). But there were some scenes with the bad guy that I didn&iexcl;¦t feel was showing me anything new so why have the extra pages?!<br /><br />SETTING &iexcl;V Southern California, where else would Koontz place one of his novels. º Setting works as usual<br /><br />PLOT &iexcl;V I felt the beginning dragged. I kept asking myself, where is this headed and why is the author taking the scenic route vs. the direct route? After about the first 35% the story took off for me and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />OVERALL &iexcl;V Well done, I enjoyed it and wouldn&iexcl;¦t mind listening to the audio book again in about a year.	2004-11-26

This made for us hating the bad guy more, but it was a bit too much information<br /><br />CHARACTERS - Pages are given to the backgrounds of characters in an attempt to provide depth, but came across as an information dump at times. Good guy is likeable, bad guy is detestable, and those in-between play their necessary roles. It all works and in the end we do want to see more of Cal, which is a good thing<br /><br />SETTING - Modern day, making use of recent historical facts, the setting plays its part. The bad guy's hold-out was a bit unbelievable, but the explanations leave it semi-satisfactorily acceptable<br /><br />PLOT - At first I couldn't figure out where the story was headed and how events and characters were connected. Yet, through a complicated but well described process all parties come together to play their part. Nice ending too boot.<br /><br />OVERALL - Good story, which is a good thing since this is my first experience with Mr. Forsyth's writing. If it wasn't for the overly graphic violence and the character information dumps, I would have rated this higher. Still worth a read/listen	2004-11-26

It felt like 80% of the book is comprised of the thoughts of the main character and only the main character's. Would have been nice to get into the heads of other characters and give us some variety not to mention NOT get into the character's head so much and give us a story where something actually happens<br /><br />3) I have to ask myself, \\"Why did I stick with the story till the end?\\" One reason is I listened to the unabridged audio book version and thus while I commuted it was a descent distraction. Secondly, I was waiting every minute for the story to take a turn for the better. For me this didn't happen till the end.<br /><br />4) The ending for me was the best part, more so than the beginning as others have pointed out. His ending is similar to two short-stories I have written. The concept is neither popular nor common so I appreciated the effort of exploring the \\"religious\\" explanation for the events<br /><br />5) There are a lot of unanswered questions. Though this is not appreciated by many readers it makes sense and fits logically in this story and from the perspective of the characters in the story.<br /><br />OVERALL: Not a great story. If I was reading the book vs. listening to the audio version I would have put it down by the first 100 pages I'm sure. I'm about 30% through By the Light of the Moon by Koontz and I'm enjoying that story much, much better	2004-10-17

I read a lot of different things which sometimes contains unwanted content. No problem. I simply keep reading and ignore that portion of the book.<br /><br />However, there were three to four specific instances in this book where I really had a hard time because the author seems like he really doesn't know what he is talking about.<br />- For instance the main protagonist is remembering a situation in his Harvard class where a student says that in Christianity man's image of God is that of an old man with a beard sitting in white robes sitting on a thrown. To which the protagonist responds of course and didn't you notice it is rooted in the pagan mythology of the image we have of the Greek god, Zeus? I personally can't remember anywhere where it states in the Bible or propagated throughout mainstream Christianity that God is an old man with a beard, white robes and sitting on a throne.<br /><br />2) With blatant goofs like that out of the way and the skimming through the author's preaching of his anti-religion/anti-God beliefs...I have to say I was thoroughly pulled into this story.<br /><br />3) Great mystery and wonderful handling of the writing by the author to keep the suspense going through high tension scenes<br /><br />4) Great use of foreshadowing that gets you to want to find out what did the author mean by that clue<br /><br />5) A LOT of character internal conflicts of emotions and thoughts. I swear it felt like 30% of the book was getting into the minds of the characters. In many other books with such a high percentage of the writing is dedicated to this aspect of the story they unfortunately aren't handled very well. But here the author keeps the pace going and the thoughts are believable and make you connect with the characters better<br /><br />6) The end seemed drawn out.<br /><br />7) Kudos to the author for writing a story that deals very clearly with controversial issues. . .even if he misrepresents both sides of the argument<br /><br />8) The setting was phenomenal!

I swear it felt like 30% of the book was getting into the minds of the characters. In many other books with such a high percentage of the writing is dedicated to this aspect of the story they unfortunately aren't handled very well. But here the author keeps the pace going and the thoughts are believable and make you connect with the characters better<br /><br />6) The end seemed drawn out.<br /><br />7) Kudos to the author for writing a story that deals very clearly with controversial issues. . .even if he misrepresents both sides of the argument<br /><br />8) The setting was phenomenal!

It didn't have the same level of mystic elements as the first book nor the rising action of the 2nd, but it resolved all the necessary characters and sub-plots well<br /><br />2) I agree some of the other reviews that the author had an opportunity to exploit some battle scenes but decided in skirting the issue. The author decided to quickly resolve the battles instead of taking the reader through the mayhem and chaos of such events. A missed opportunity in my opinion<br /><br />3) The emotional bonds between the characters are believable and connecting with the reader<br /><br />4) I've read a lot of fantasy and whenever \\"prophecy\\" is introduced into the story it MAY add to the mystic elements or detract from the story by giving things away too early. I believe this happened here in that some opportunities to increase the suspense of a scene was lost due to me as the reader already knowing that Takeo should win based on the prophecy<br /><br />OVERALL: It still flows with the same feel as the previous two books. It was a must read to know how the story ends and made me feel like so much has happened since the first book that I'll soon need to go back and start the trilogy all over again.	2004-09-14

When things start going amiss with the water supply his investigations throw him in the middle of a disaster not just from nature but also from men who would stop him from knowing the truth about the water supply.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) CHARACTERS - First I needed to realize that I was listening to the abridged audio version. Even with that I enjoyed the main protagonist but I also found the rest of the cast to be backdrop. But I also realize the book is called Pompeii and the story is really about that part of the world more than the people in the midst of this historic disaster.<br /><br />2) SETTING - I definitely felt like I was in the Bay of Naples at this time in history. Enough detail is given to develop the right picture in one's mind but not too much that I just wanted the author to get on to other things. It appears he did his homework and delivered the right words for the overall setting.<br /><br />3) PLOT - How does one tell a natural disaster story? Not an easy question to answer and the fact that Harris chooses to take the story from the perspective of the aqueduct maintenance man shows ingenuity, creativeness and originality. At no point did it occur to me that something wasn't plausible or believable. I enjoyed the quest the protagonist had in his effort to wade through corrupt officials and the challenges of nature. Even though I didn't care for the characters that much, the story propelled me along at an even pace giving me enough suspense at the impending doom to want to know what happens next.<br /><br />OVERALL: It is a solidly good story. Not great, but worth reading.ense at the impending doom to want to know what happens next.<br /><br />OVERALL: It is a solidly good story. Not great, but worth reading.	2004-08-04

The infamous German spy, De Needle, attempts to stay one step ahead of the MI6 agents on his tail. It quickly becomes a race to stop the German spy from revealing the truth about the upcoming Allied invasion.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) CHARACTERS &iexcl;V nice backgrounds and motivations given and the players in the story stay true to character. Characters are believable because we&iexcl;¦ve all known people like them&iexcl;Kwell maybe not like De Needle. º  You cheer for the good guys and hate it when the bad guy succeeds, which is exactly what an author wants to accomplish in his writing. I appreciated that the &iexcl;§good guys&iexcl;¨ were not made out to be complete idiots and actually had some great intuition in trying to capture the bad guy.<br />2) SETTING &iexcl;V I&iexcl;¦ve never been to England but I&iexcl;¦ve seen plenty of movies that take place there. I think the author uses these preconceived ideas and already established visuals to help the reader know where the character is. Otherwise, when you look at it closely, I felt that he didn&iexcl;¦t spend a lot of time giving us environmental descriptions&iexcl;Ksome readers will find this a pleasing aspect while others may want more.<br />3) STORY &iexcl;V For the longest time I couldn&iexcl;¦t figure out what the purpose of the &iexcl;§sub-plot&iexcl;¨ of Lucy and David was all about and how it tied into the main storyline. But it was brought around nicely. Nice suspense and the last 50 pages are great wrap up.<br />4) MISC &iexcl;V There is one love scene that is VERY descriptive and may be offensive to some readers...but luckily it is only one and doesn&iexcl;¦t carry on for too long.

Rating System:<br />1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten<br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br />4 star = very good; what writing should be<br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br /><br />STORY: As one reviewer nicely put it: Rhapsody is a woman, a Singer of some talent, who is swept up into events of world-shattering import. On the run from an old romantic interest who won't take no for an answer, Rhapsody literally bumps into a couple of shady characters: half-breeds who come to her rescue in the nick of time. Only the rescue turns into an abduction, and Rhapsody soon finds herself dragged along on an epic voyage, one that spans centuries and ranges across a wonder-filled fantasy world.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) SETTING - the world in which Haydon throws her characters is easily imaginable and full of wonderful details and surprises. She takes some &#34;common&#34; fantasy races and either renames them or creates half-breeds that provide interesting changes from the typical full-blood elves, dwarves and barbarians of standard D&D or Tolkien influenced stories.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS - As mentioned the characters are interesting partly because of their uniqueness of being mixed bloods. The motivations for the three main protagonists is revealed enough that you want to help the good guys along. The interaction between the three is consistent throughout. The only complaint I had, which I also saw in other reviews, is how Rhapsody can be the &#34;most beautiful woman in the world&#34; and not realize it and take advantage of it...especially considering her prior profession before she was hijacked by Achmed and Gunthor.<br /><br />3) PLOT - Up to page 270 I couldn't wait to turn to the next page. Then for the next 100+ pages we get this huge information dump on the history of the world over the past fourteen centuries. Though creative and well though out, this was too much for me and I had to labor through it in hopes that the story would pickup with the same pace and wonder as the first 270 pages. Well it didn't fully. The pace does pickup and the story progresses a bit more but there is still a lot of history and background given in the rest of the book.<br />Eventually you realize...there is no main &#34;antagonist&#34; for everyone (yet), which was ok with me and made it so I couldn't predict exactly what was going to happen.<br /><br />This is a story of how these three characters find themselves in a new world and how they cope. It does lay the ground work for an &#34;ultimate&#34; evil that needs to be conquered but that isn't in this book.<br /><br />OVERALL: I really liked the book and it kept my interest plenty as I'm one who doesn't HAVE to finish a book like some people feel obligated finish after a couple hundred pages or so. I'm inclined to read the rest of the original trilogy (I think a 4th book is out now) as I do want to continue the journey with the characters.h for me and I had to labor through it in hopes that the story would pickup with the same pace and wonder as the first 270 pages.

You can zip through his book in no time<br />2) Warning: Adult content. Explicit sex, profanity and alternate lifestyles within these pages. Some reader may find this offensive.<br />3) Biggest complaint I had was how immature I felt the author handled the sex. It was almost like a dirty old man sharing his personal fantasies vs. an author deftly crafting a steamy scene.<br />4) Stone is a strong, fun character to follow and he is clich&eacute; in all the ways that readers like and keep coming back for more.<br />OVERALL: I think the average person will find this a good read, even though I personally didn't care for the ending much. Its not that I felt the author jipped me or tied things up too nicely, I personally didn't care for the central content of why things happened. I've been told that this is his only book done this way and if I liked his writing then try his other Barrington books. I will do this.	2004-04-26

Not many quick meals here.<br />3) In general, nice pictures of the meals. Some aren't very flattering to the dish and thus doesn't make me want to make it<br />4) Interspersed are pictures of the ingredients used...I thought this was very helpful especially for some &quot;unfamiliar&quot; ingredients (i.e. special soy products, etc)<br />5) Recipes are nicley written out and easy to follow<br />OVERALL: It is a good book that I found sparked ideas that could be prepared quicker and just as loaded with protein, carbs and low fat.

Anyone monitoring the email over there?<br /><br />5) Would have appreciated more details on how to prepare at home for the program vs. if I have a gym membership.<br />For example I'm finding I really needed to take stock of my home weights. But after doing this program a time or two I was able to figure out what size weights I needed to buy and add to my collection in order to get through the entire 12 weeks. This is a little tip I would have liked up front because if it was in the book I didn't see it.<br /><br />6) Get the journal! It helps! I studied the core book then took it back to the library, but I definitely believe in owning the journal. I'm glad I got it since it is making my preparation for the program so much easier. I'm giving the journal a 4 star and leaving this at a 3.<br /><br />7) The before and after pictures are awesome!<br /><br />8) I had some friends attempt this plan about two years ago. Several gained a lot of &#34;fat&#34;/bulk but it really seemed because they were eating 6 times a day and not watching their portion sizes. Beware.<br /><br />9) Two years ago I dared myself to do a triatholon and I didn't even know how to swim.

Millions will die unless humankind changes its ways immediately.&quot;<br />On the run from the world government and other forces, Randolph battles to regain all that he has lost and save the world at the same time.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) At first I was groaning at the thought of some extremist \\"tree-hugging\\" storyline. Yet Bova handles the subject matter VERY well without getting overly preachy.<br />2) Some nice plot twists and believable opposition established<br />3) A complaint (not the only one) is that the end seemed to get wrapped up a little too swift and nicely. It ignored some issues that normally would carry on a lot longer considering the \\"history\\" Bova built between characters and the world they live in.<br />4) The character of Dan Randolph was enjoyable to read and the people who help him at various turns are a nice mix to watch<br />5) The audio book reader does a good job and even had different voices for different characters, which I always prefer.<br />OVERALL: It was interesting and entertaining.

I couldn't keep them straight, probably because I was listening to an audio tape and didn't have the visual reinforcement<br /><br />5) Mark Rolston does a good but not great job.<br />For an audio dramatization it is hard to compare someone like Mark who reads all the characters in his own voice as compared to someone like BD Wong or Roddy McDowell who takes on different voice for different characters. I did like Mark in Aliens though. Go Drake!<br /><br />OVERALL: Worth the effort if you commit to reading the following books.

It was all just too fantastic to think that \\"grown adults\\" could believe and propagate those beliefs in others for centuries.<br />2) At several points I got lost. With the truck load of historical facts presented, there was some jumping around.

He only writes the forward, so Roddy fans shouldn't expect more from him.<br />MY FEEDBACK: I really enjoyed this book. A couple of chapters I felt were slightly clich&eacute; and/or close to stretching scripture out of context in order to get a point across, but that was all very minimal and easy to forgive.<br />Overall, the Lord used this to really speak to me and confirm the direction I've been headed with writing and/or to kick me in the rear about a few things I needed to get better at. I really like the chapter on whether I'm driving myself of my own strength or being led by the Spirit.<br />Each chapter has a quick example or two so it doesn't get bogged down like many Christian books by being 90% examples and only 10% content. This book I felt was more like 85% content and only 15% examples which made it very enjoyable and able to get right to the point of the chapter.<br />If you are a writer who is a Christian, whether you write Christian pieces or secular, get this bible study as it is a nice temperature gauge of where you are at with God and what he has called you to really do with your writing.<br />If you are a Christian thinking about writing as a hobby or ministry get this book as it will set some good foundations for you.<br />I personally see myself going through this book at least once a year in order to remind myself of a few things I need to keep in mind and stay on track in as I work at the writing God has called me to do.t this book as it will set some good foundations for you.<br />I personally see myself going through this book at least once a year in order to remind myself of a few things I need to keep in mind and stay on track in as I work at the writing God has called me to do.	2004-02-11

It is a very fast paced book full of clich&eacute;s but delivered so well that it becomes a spoof on the pirate genre.<br />OVERALL: Very fun story that I couldn't guess the end to. Engaging at every level.	2004-02-06

Meanwhile, Shirakawa Kaede must try to unify the domain she has inherited, while fighting off would-be suitors and hoping that Takeo will return to her.\\"<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) You don't really need to read the first book to understand this story because the author does enough reflection and backstory to get a reader up to speed. BUT...it is so much better if you do read Across the Nightingale Floor first.<br />2) The characters of Takeo and Kaede are explored more and we as readers continue our bond and love for them. Kaede plays a much larger role in this book than the first.<br />3) This second/middle book doesn't seem to suffer from middle-book syndrome but continues with the same strength as the first. The first book resolved enough without having to read this book, but this book definitely sets the stage for interesting events to happen in the 3rd book.<br />Very little is resolved in this book. This book was truly the rising action of the series making you feel that the climax is just around the corner and me as a reader anxious to get there.<br />4) The same actors come back to this book to do the voices in this unabridged representation of the book. The acting is very well done and enjoyable throughout.<br />OVERALL: Fantastic continuation. I can't wait till the end of the trilogy!	2004-02-03

Again Snow is confronted with a mystery and crimes of the local military base as he tracks down the kidnapped five-year-old son of his former sweetheart.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) I so liked Christopher Snow, his dog Orson, his \\"dream\\" girlfriend Sasha, and his funny buddy Bobby that I had to come back for seconds. Each of the characters has a sense of humor and enjoyable qualities that make the reader connect and care for them.<br />2) The first-person told story works pretty well and kept my attention more than if this were told in the third person. I had an immediate bond with the protagonist and this allowed Koontz to keep the reader in the dark as much as he keeps Christopher Snow in the dark on a lot of issues. It added to the mysteriousness of the mystery, if you know what I mean.<br />3) Problem with this story is that Koontz goes on and on with every bit of setting description and tangents through the thoughts of the character. Though some of the thoughts are funny and entertaining, the story extends a typical 5 page scene into a 25+ page scene.<br />At some points I was screaming, \\"Get to the point\\". While at other points the drawing out of the scene added to an extended sense of suspense that became intense and like eating raw lemons there is a part that says in your mind, \\"Why am I doing this to myself\\", and another part that thoroughly enjoys it no matter how much it makes your face pucker.<br />4) Keith Szarabajka did a great job of acting out this book, which probably added to some of the moments of suspense and well delivery of humor. Great job, Keith.<br />5) I think I like the story better in this second book than the first.

Built in the 1890's, the Asylum has stood vacant for decades. But now, the wrecker's ball is about to strike, smashing into stone-and unleashing a terrible evil, an unholy fear long locked with the walls. Soon, strange gifts will begin to appear on the doorsteps of Blackstone's finest citizens.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />Overall, whenever I read or listen to a John Saul book it is entertaining but not great. There is always some unknown ingredient missing to take the story to the next stage. But with Lee Meriwether portraying the voices in this story, I got the creeps. This was truly a tale of evil and not Saul's normal fixation with only children.<br /><br />I'm still trying to figure out if I like the ending or not, because I felt some things were left unexplained. Maybe this was purposely done by the author. Regardless, overall it was an engaging story that left me feeling disturbed at the potential reality of such evil.<br /><br />I liked it!	2004-01-07

Writers will discover step-by-step guidelines for structuring plots and creating realistic characters.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />First and foremost, this book delivered on what it said it would. The basic structure of a story along with essential and optional cast is presented here.<br />I really appreciated that Mr. Vogler kept things brief and to the point. Every section was only a paragraph or two and got to the meat of things. He didn't waste space with fifteen fillers as examples to support each and every point.<br />One of my writing groups recommended this as a great resource to keep handy and refer to at the beginning, middle and end of your story writing to ensure you have the essential ingredients in all marketable stories.<br />For those of you who hate any kind of structure that makes writing look like a formula, you need to open your mind. My two cents worth: If I'm going to spend the next several years or longer working on a novel (some of you know what I'm talking about) then I want to get some return for my effort. Mimicing some overall structure can only increase my chances of positive monetary return vs. a story that sits unpublished for my great great-grandchildren to read one day after I'm dead and gone. Hopefully you get my meaning. Get the book. It is a keeper.	2003-12-31

EMERGENCE is the story of her turbulent odyssey across a scarred America seeking others of her kind and a new future for the people of Earth.&#34;<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) SETTING: Palmer does a great job of describing a post-holocaust Earth that is destroyed mostly by biological weapons. This creates an eerie and adventurous setting for our protagonist to travel through.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: Even though main protagonist is a strong-willed teenager she has many endearing qualities that get you to care for the character and root for her. The supporting cast is well chosen and not thrown in haphazardly but helps to bring out more of Candy as the primary protagonist. The characters mostly being &#34;geniuses&#34; communicate and make decisions very, very logically. This is a logic lover's book!<br /><br />3) WRITING & DIALOGUE: This is probably the most unique thing about this book. Approximately 85% or more is written as the journal entries of Candy in a short-hand version. Before you groan and decide this isn't for you, realize that this keeps the dialogue funny, crisp, clean and the action moving. At first I thought I'd get tired of the writing but once I fell into the flow of things I appreciated the writing style and that it allowed the author not to waste space but get to the point.<br /><br />4) PLOT: Great story that had adventure, mystery and even saving the world type events. Nuff said.<br /><br />OVERALL: Very engaging book. Different than most stories. Amazing this is out of print considering it is also a Hugo Award winner.

Now begins the story of mans first contact with alien intelligence.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />+ This is a story of discovery, not character development or a bad guy to vanquish. This is an adventure that takes you through a wonderful and strange world. If you can go into it with that mindset you'll love this book.<br /><br />+ Like many &#34;classic&#34; sci-fi books this left me thinking about it afterwards. It is hard to say much about this book without giving anything away. Suffice it to say, this is about a team of brave individuals who dare the unknown.<br /><br />+ The book is very easy to read and I finished it in a day and a half.<br /><br />&#62; I've heard that it isn't worth going on to the other books in the series, but to read only this one and enjoy it for what it is. I have to say, that the book is good to the very last line.<br /><br />+ Very satisfying ending, in my opinion.<br /><br />Give me a few years and I'll probably pick this up again and relive it for the new things I missed the first time and the nostalgia of the things I remember.

STORY: Colonel Jack O'Neil is sent back to Abydos as a liaison with a private corporation to harvest the rare crystal that gave the now dead Ra his technology. Little do they know but the newly freed people of Abydos aren't about to tolerate another dictatorship. Nor is Ra's vicious successor, Hathor, going to let someone else move in on her rightful territory as a god ruler.<br />MY FEEDBACK: To be able to compress a full novel to two cassette tapes shows that there is very little meat or character development here.<br />Plot lines were telegraphed and thus provided zero surprises. Characters were cardboard and had little or no depth. You are better watching a rerun episode of the Sci-Fi channel series or watching the movie again than wasting your time on this one.<br />The one redeeming factor that let me give this a 2 star instead of a 1 star rating: is the entire end battle goes on for a good portion of the story and thus kept me listening through the last audio tape. Yet, even this was anticlimactic as it set things up for the next book in the series. It is all more of a marketing ploy than a desire to write a good book. Highly disappointing and I'm not going to involve myself in the next book, Stargate: Retaliation.	2003-12-24

Warriors, assassins and scheming clan lords fill this story of honor, friendship, love, loyalty and mystery. I can't compare this to Shogun (which may be a bit of a different kind of story) but as compared to the very enjoyable Cloud of Sparrows by Takashi Matsuoka, I enjoyed this one even more.<br /><br />This story builds up to a single climatic event and doesn't crap out through the process. This story is told from the first person, which allows you to really get into the inner person of Takeo. Takeo is a character you enjoy, sympathize with, empathize with, and you can't wait for him to explode upon the forces of evil. You walk in his footsteps and feel what he feels each step of the way.<br /><br />I can't better give any helpful details other than to say that even if this isn't your typical genre you will probably like this. I can't imagine this not appealing to all readers. Get it!	2003-12-12

In the shadow of the Great Ice, the sinister Mylio makes the boy his apprentice. Thus starts the journey for Alv (later named Elof) who discovers the ability within himself to smith items of power beyond what he or others imagine. His journeys take him to the deepest mountains of the duerger and to the lands of the children of the forest then to the battlements of the Southerners where he alone may have the ability to turn the tides of the coming Ice.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />Several series I read in High School Ive hated later as an adult (i.e. Dragonlance). But this series still kept me turning page after page in anticipation of what will happen next. I have no complaints about the setting, characters, plot, sense of originality or overall writing.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that it seemed at a couple of points that a female duerger (dwarf in my mind and based on authors descriptions) spoke in the exact same matter as a Southern Lord. This got a bit irritating for me, but the rest of the story allowed me to overlook this.<br /><br />This is one of those well crafted stories that build up to a single climatic event vs. the current trend in media where every 15 minutes a climatic event occurs. But nowhere along the lines of building up to the event did I find the story slow, cliche, or boring. This is definitely up there in my top 5 series of all time. Get your hands on a copy ASAP. You won?t be disappointed.<br /><br />***Update 11/26/2012***<br />Since I finally tracked down all six books in the related series (all out of print and last 3 nearly impossible to get in the States), today I reread book 1 The Anvil of Ice, while sitting and waiting for jury duty.<br /><br />I can't think of any other book where the main character grows/learns to become a magesmith (can imbue power into items he crafts). I think this makes the story fresh and unique. I especially appreciate there are no cliche prophecies of the chosen one who will come one day to fight off the dark ones. That ruins so many stories for me, but lucky not present here.<br /><br />Again I'm left very satisfied with this read, which solves a major plot, but also ends like a cliffhanger.<br />You could choose to stop with book 1 or keep reading.

But now the malevolent creatures that normally skulk in the shadows of the park grow bolder, and old secrets hint at a violent explosion. The brewing conflict draws John Ross to Hopewell. A Knight of the Word, Ross is plagued by nightmares that tell him someone evil is coming to unleash an ancient horror upon the world. Caught between them is fourteen-year-old Nest Freemark, who senses that something is terribly wrong but has not yet learned to wield the budding power that sets her apart from her friends.&#34;<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />I unknowingly listened to book 3 of the series first then I got my hands on this one (book1). I don't feel like I totally missed out because both books are contained stories which made the &#34;out of orderness&#34; (such a thing?) bearable.<br /><br />I like the story since it leaves the typical fantasy and sci-fi genres and deals with magic and demons in the current world. There are enough mysteries to keep you in the story with a desire to want to know what happens next. He handles suspense situations fine and has enough subplot going on to add some depth and reality to characters and setting.<br /><br />All I can say about the end of the story without giving anything away is that I personally found the ending very anti-climatic. If it was handled differently I would have given this a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />OVERALL: Enjoyable story, characters and setting. It was a bit better than good because of the &#34;uniqueness&#34; of the story setting but not great because of the ending demise of the opposition.

But more importantly how one man (slave) can change the face of a nation.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) SETTING: There is always something magical about ancient Egypt and Smith crafts a story utilizing the full effect of this setting. Got to love it.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: Heroism and valor generate instant liking to a couple of the characters. Clever solutions to impossible tasks make us totally love the character of Taita.<br /><br />3) PLOT: This was really two shorter stories in one. The first is a novelette on how Tanus falls in love with Lady Lostris and with Taita's help they cleverly overcome many obstacles. Much of this story was telegraphed and not surprising. But Smith takes the story on a whole different direction as we go (very quickly) through the fall of Egypt to the Hyksos. This was full of unexpected twists and was a nice storyline.<br /><br />4) CONTENT: Unlike his sequel, The Seventh Scroll, this was a &#34;clean&#34; story. There wasn't a need for overt sex in this story and I think it paid off that the author chose to leave things to the imagination instead. Some gruesome violence but otherwise a PG-13 rated story.<br /><br />5) READER: The reader of the audio-book did a fine job of voices and acting. Some of the voices made me feel like I was watching the movie The Prince of Egypt. A fine job.<br /><br />OVERALL: I enjoyed this story and thought it was more than just &#34;good&#34;. It was a story that leaves something to be desired at first but then pulls it all together later on. I gave it a 3.5 rating because it was just a bit above good, but not great.	2003-11-24

In the midst of political pressures and physical dangers, they dare to fall in love with each other while trying to avoid their destiny.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />I picked this up because so many other books in this series have won the Hugo and/or Nebula. This book definitely sets the stage for what is to come: high political intrigue and assassinations; dangers that require bravery and courage; and events to challenge friendships and loyalty; and of course some romance. This book has all these in one sense or another.<br />The friendship and loyalty of characters really stands out and makes you really love the character of Aral Vorkosaigan. This is also an intelligent story, where solutions are not only resolved by chance or brute force but clever use of what resources are at hand. It gave me the grand and subtle pleasantness I had when reading Asimov's Foundation series. It had just enough science in the fiction to be appreciated and it had just the right touch of romance so as not to turn some of us testosterone males off to the story. I really enjoyed this story and found it a very easy read.	2003-11-24

Combine that with locations that are unseen by normal man and you have a nice formula for adventure.<br />2) CHARACTERS: Likeable good guys and despicable bad guys. No gray characters, which is fine by me and didn't seem necessary for the story. The characters are a little more than just clothes on a skeleton, because the author does flesh them out a bit and give them some clear distinctions.<br />3) PLOT: I like the plot. The mystery that the characters have to figure out combined with the challenges in reaching their goal kind of felt like an Indy story. Yes, some of it was predictable and telegraphed a mile away. But this kind of story focuses on the magic of discovery and even though the discovery of the character decisions wasn't a strong point, the discovery of the treasure was nicely handled.<br />4) Audio Book Reader - the reader did an above average reading. Some voice / accent variations for different characters and good acting made it an enjoyable listen.<br />5) Content - This is what really brought the book down for me. I'm going along at a nice even pace when suddenly we take a detour into a short but explicit sex scene. I wasn't expecting it. I yelled of the words, \\"marketing ploy\\" as this combined with some other aspects really turned the story into a \\"trashy\\" romance to some extent. It was like a movie throwing in a gratuitous sex scene just so it could get an R rating and attract more patrons. I was disappointed in this unnecessary component.<br />OVERALL: I liked the book, especially how the author refers to his previous book within this book as if he is also a fictional character in the world of Royan and Nicholas. From what I've read it sounds like I'll like the first book even more (didnt' know at the time there was a first book). I'm not disappointed I spent the time I did going through this one. It is a bit better than good but not what I would consider a very good book.so it could get an R rating and attract more patrons.

From what I've read it sounds like I'll like the first book even more (didnt' know at the time there was a first book). I'm not disappointed I spent the time I did going through this one. It is a bit better than good but not what I would consider a very good book.	2003-11-12

Before Pitt climbs out of the hole he runs afoul of the Solpemachace, a group of three brothers who steal and sell Indian artifacts. Pitt finds a rope sculpture, a quipu, that points the way to a huge Inca treasure. Meanwhile, the Solpemachace steal the Golden Body Suit of Tiapollo, which leads them to the same treasure inside a mountain in Baja, Mexico.&quot; The race for the treasure and the saving of lives are in Pitt's hands.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />If I was comparing this to &quot;real&quot; literature this book would get rated very low. But thankfully this isn't my first endeavor into a Cussler book so I knew to suspend disbelief and enjoy it for what it is.<br />As with his other stories, the main character is never really in any danger because he is James Bond, Indiana Jones and The Terminator rolled into one. There is never any doubt that Dirk Pitt will pull off the impossible, which is what makes these stories fun. There is no time to intellecutalize events or think if they are possible or not, they are just there and the reader is along for the ride.<br />This is my third Cussler book and the reason why I had to knock it down a star is because I just happen to have the luck that the opening few scenes seem to mimic almost event-after-event what happens in another one of his books. The only difference were the characters and locations.  That was disappointing, but I quickly got over it and enjoyed the ride.<br />I cannot comment in detail on Characterization or Plot line because the story is more like a fantasy than something that takes place in real life. In other words, if you've read Cussler before and enjoyed it you are sure to like this story. If this is your first attempt at Cussler, just go into it with the right attitude and you should have fun.<br />As compared to the other two books from Cussler that I've worked through, this one was the better of the three (Serpent and the other I can't remember the name).<br />Also, I didn't give it a higher rating because I listened to the audio book version and the reader seemed to not have a lot of life and emotion in his reading. He had great voices for characters, especially Pitt, but when there is an action scene his reading should have been more intense and faster paced in order to draw the listener into the scene more.<br />Otherwise, it was an enjoyable story.through, this one was the better of the three (Serpent and the other I can't remember the name).<br />Also, I didn't give it a higher rating because I listened to the audio book version and the reader seemed to not have a lot of life and emotion in his reading.

Not knowing what else to do with his life he finds himself getting sucked into a world under our own, unknown to most of mankind, where the gods of old are preparing to wage war against the gods of new.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK<br />This was an amazing story. I was just caught up into the magic and expertise of the world created by Gaiman. This truly felt like one of the most original stories I've read in a long time. My only complaint is that I felt like this was a long book which is why I didn't give it a full 5 stars. Luckily, just when I was getting tired of a scene/situation, things would change and something new and unexpected would occur.<br />A nice mystery mixed with magic, myth and folklore. From the books that I've read that have won either the Hugo, Nebula or both awards, I have to say this is one that I feel really did deserve the awards won. Like his Sandman storyline, this is one that will keep you wondering what new surprises will happen next.<br /><br />Get it!!	2003-10-19
US	51979649	R8NCPVPIMHE1X	0671047345	141415139	Separation of Power (Mitch Rapp Novels)	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Review of audi book version. Rating of 4.5 stars	STORY: Mitch Rapp, Anna Riley and Irene Kennedy are back. This time forces are at work to stop Irene Kennedy from being confirmed to the position of Director of the CIA and Mitch is torn between his work and settling down with the love of his life, Anna Riley. Not to mention someone has to find if Saddam Hussein has access to weapons of mass destruction and if he does, then someone has to stop him.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING: Again we are in a current day world where spies, assassins and government conspiracies prevail. The world created is believable and functional but nothing super great or memorable.<br />2) CHARACTERS: I'm glad that Mr. Flynn is sticking with a working formula and brining the continuing adventures of characters we have grown to love. Thus if you have read the other books prior to this one there are no real surprises. The characters stay true to form though by now there is very little new to reveal about them. They work and they are still fun to read about.<br />3) PLOT: No major surprises, suspense or red herrings, but Mr. Flynn still develops a solid story that keeps you wanting to know what happens next. You know the good guys are going to win, but there is enough mystery to not know exactly how they will prevail above the opposition. Some may consider this formularic but it works and is still an enjoyable read.<br />4) READER: Armand Schultz is the reader of the audio book version and he does a good job. He has different accents and reflections for different characters, but not nearly the same \\"impersonation\\" ability as Roddy McDowell or some other readers. This was most noticeable when the female characters would speak. His very masculine voice was a bit distracting at such times. But he has a great Mitch Rapp voice.<br />OVERALL: If you enjoyed any of his previous Mitch Rapp stories you'll enjoy this one. I almost didn't bother since it was such a long duration between reading the previous book and getting my hands on this one. But I'm glad I continued with the storyline and characters.'m glad I continued with the storyline and characters.	2003-10-18

Pornographic writing is contained within this story and may be offensive to some readers.<br /><br />STORY: Meredith, the Elven American Princess of the fairy kingdom has been in hiding for the last three years. Now her cover is blown while investigating a case as a private detective. Everyone is after her to either return and claim her birthright to the throne of fairies or to be killed so she doesn't.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING: As with her Anita Blake series, the author creates an alternate Earth where supernatural beings coexist with humans. The fairy folk and other beings are accepted and given rights, though there are paparazzi that follow the fairy royals around trying to capture the latest scandal or secret. The environment is interesting and adds to the magic of the story.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: The story is filled with the expected characters necessary to make this a fantasy-romance. Chiseled manly bodies, woman of beauty and intelligence and characters willing to do whatever for sex. Meredith is another strong female character as is her vampire hunter Anita Blake. But unlike Anita, Meredith, is very insecure in her abilities, mostly because she doesn't believe she has any. We see her grown in confidence and power as the story goes which keeps a integral part of the story interesting.<br /><br />3) STORY: My main complaint is that the book starts off as a good mystery but ends up anti-climatically. It is as if the author didn't know how to end the story so she just leaves off at a so-so part in the lives of these characters. The author at least spends several pages in summarizing where everyone is, what the &#34;final&#34; outcome is to each character, and leaves it so that she can write a sequel. I felt a bit cheated. Otherwise, the setting and characters carried the story more for me than the plot...whereas her Anita Blake book, Guilty Pleasures, had a nice mystery that was deftly handled. I wish she could have done something like that here.<br /><br />4) CONTENT: As mentioned this book contains rated-X sex scenes. There is some but very little profanity. The violence gets pretty gory and may be tough on some readers.<br /><br />5) AUDIOBOOK READER - this unabridged book is read by Laural Merlington. The reader does a fine job of different voice for different characters, which is needed with this book. The reader's voice is entertaining, clear and well acted. Nice job!<br /><br />OVERALL: I like this author, though this isn't a great example of her writing in my opinion (then again I've only read two of her books). If it wasn't for the overt sex (not found in Guilty Pleasures book, regardless of what the title brings to mind) and the somewhat weak storyline I would have rated this higher.<br /><br />In other words, you can take this book or leave it depending on your opinion on the explicit content you'll definitely find.e mystery that was deftly handled.

There are even laws that give vampires certain rights in this new world. Our brief glimpse of the world created is teasing in its possibilities and enjoyable.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: Anita Blake is our main protagonist. She is a female version of a smart-mouthed detective from some stereotypical gumshoe story. She is a character who proudly displays her stereotypes but also enjoyable has a couple of traits that add something memorable. I liked the character enough that she is more the reason why I would want to read the next book than because the plot was maybe fabulous.<br /><br />3) PLOT: Speaking of plot, it was a nice little mystery. I didn't feel that there were enough clues to who the 'bad' guy was but the story had enough unexpected events that I kept reading. Story was overall handled well though I would have liked to see more 'action' scenes vs. scenes that were potentially eruptive in action, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />4) CONTENT: This book would be rated R for gore and violence. The sensual scenes were handled very professionally, were brief and were NOT graphic sexually,which I appreciated. I wanted a vampire, action, mystery and that is what I got.<br /><br />OVERALL: I liked this book and if someone likes to read vampire books and have a mystery I'd recommend this in a heartbeat. Just because the covers of this series and the titles of the books may imply this is erotic horror, this book wasn't. If the rest of the series is, I don't know. But this was a fun little read that I really enjoyed.	2003-10-03
US	51979649	R106F2CFUTMXS6	0441005667	204362253	Forever Peace	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Not my cup of tea, but well written...	STORY: As some editorial reviews put it: Veteran sf writer Haldeman views this novel NOT as a continuation of but as a follow-up to the problems raised in his highly acclaimed 1975 novel, Forever War. Julian Class is a full-time professor and part-time combat veteran who spends a third of each month virtually wired to a robotic \\"soldierboy.\\" The soldierboys, along with flyboys and other advanced constructs, allow the U.S. to wage a remotely controlled war against constant uprisings in the Third World. The conflicts are largely driven by the so-called First World countries' access to nanoforges--devices that can almost instantly manufacture any product imaginable, given the proper raw materials--and the Third World countries' lack of access to these devices. But even as Julian learns that the consensual reality shared by soldierboy operators can lead to universal peace, the nanoforges create a way for humanity to utterly destroy itself, and it will be a race against time to see which will happen first.\\"<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING - the story takes place in 2043 a.d. on Earth. There are references to space travel, but the entire drama and story take place on an Earth where political forces are at war in every country. Thus a world at war with itself is believable. Also, Haldeman employs scientific advances that are reminiscent of cyberpunk stories like Neuromancer and the like.<br />2) CHARACTERS - Julian Class and Dr. Amelia Harding are the two protagonists. Characters are likeable and flawed. Julian is mostly flawed due to the society he has grown up in, the job he has been recruited to and the challenges of changing it all. But he moves forward amidst his flaws which makes him likeable. The overall cast is interesting, but don't get involved much. The story is very isolated to only the two protagonists.<br />3) STORY - This is not a heavily action book. This is a political story (not my favorite, which is why I didn't give it a higher rating). The plot does progress at an even pace that kept me reading the entire 350 or so pages, but because of the political machine at work I turned the pages out of interest not eager anticipation. The few \\"fight\\"/war scenes are brief but like the rest of the book are nicely handled. He is a good writer, what can I say. It is cool how he uses his advance technology not only to bring about the macro conflict but to also bring about the solution.<br />4) CONTENT - Very little if any profanity. Violence is rated \\"R\\" for some graphic content. Sexuality is rated \\"NC-17\\" or could be considered soft-core porn due to some intimate details. But the sex scenes were few and brief and didn't go on for pages and pages.<br />OVERALL: Even though it isn't my kind of book, I can see how a lot of people may really enjoy this and thus it received the Hugo and Nebula it did. Depending on your tastes it may be well worth checking out.progress at an even pace that kept me reading the entire 350 or so pages, but because of the political machine at work I turned the pages out of interest not eager anticipation.

After showing his true and terrifying colors, Dracula boards a ship for England in search of new, fresh blood. Unexplained disasters begin to occur in the streets of London before the mystery and the evil doer are finally put to rest.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) SETTING: The eerie Transylvania with fogs and local superstitions that keep people indoors on many nights. England with its many alleyways and secluded estates allow for characters to find themselves in predicaments where they are far from help. The settings work very well for this story.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: The cast of characters are all believable and interesting. Van Helsing involvement in the story is original and enjoyable. Everyone of the close-minded British of the time stay true to character and add a level of conflict and frustration on the reader because it is hard to imagine people being so stupid, yet you know in your heart they were (are) like that.<br /><br />3) STORY: I knocked this down a star because a large majority of the story is in the form of reading journals. These endless reports almost feel like droning exposition and leave the reader yawning from sleepiness and boredom. I'm glad I listened to the Big Radio Players version of this as the audio format allowed for wonderful eerie music, great special effect sounds, and a cast of different characters and voices that matched well with the casting of the story.<br />Even though this is my first time reading/listening to this story, it has been overdone in media so much that as each scene was revealed I knew what was going to happen. Thus, this over exposure to the story I believe detracted from the enjoyment I would have had if I was totally new to the content and unfamiliar with the legend of Dracula. Thus I had to knock it down a star because the story was predictable, but no fault of its own.<br />I had to raise it up another star because Stoker does capture some wonderful scenes of suspense, especially in the beginning of the story. His choice of description demonstrates a wonderful ability to say exactly what he means.<br /><br />4) CONTENT: There is some innuendo to sensual things when the succubus show up, other than that even the violence is not too graphic. I'd say this is PG by today's standards.<br /><br />OVERALL: I'm glad I finally got my hands on this &#34;classic&#34;. I don't feel like I could read or listen to it again, but I did enjoy this one time journey through it.other star because Stoker does capture some wonderful scenes of suspense, especially in the beginning of the story.

When he shows mercy to one of his &#34;clients&#34; he is sent into a world he had never seen other than from the walls of the Citadel. Now begins the adventures of a young man in a world of love, magic and science.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING: A nice, complex fantasy world is created here with a melding of science and magic. Wolfe's descriptions are bordering on poetic as he clearly creates vivid images of places, people and governmental hierarchies.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: Severian is a very likeable character...for a torturer. You realize he is the way he his because he knows no other life. He knows not how to lie and deceive but delivers the truth with as much brutal, calm honesty as he does his executions and other torturer's tasks.  After page 100, the story begins to fill with a greater cast of characters. By the end of the book the main &#34;band&#34; of adventurers remain as individual mysteries even though they are believable and likeable.<br /><br />3) STORY: This is where I have some issues.<br />a) First of all, I struggled with much of the language used in this book. I had to look up a lot of words in my dictionary, due to the use of terms not common in the everyday writing or reading.<br />b) Secondly, what should have been in the front of the book, turned out to be in an Appendix at the back. In his Appendix he briefly describes that he made up many words. The words seemed like &#34;real&#34; words, but it wasn't till I got to the end did I realize that I was unnecessarily getting frustrated at my new dictionary for not containing these unfamiliar terms. I was unhappy to find out after-the-fact that no dictionary would have contained the terms I was searching for.<br />c) The story is written like an autobiography with brief interludes to the present. This worked well and gave hints of what is to become of this youth many years later.<br />d) Many of the events seemed to go off into nowhere tangents. I realize that it was in part because our protagonist had never been outside the Citadel walls (more or less) so he was enamored with everything he saw. Pages are giving to descriptions of walls, building and things that really have no bearing on the story line...the setting, maybe...but our character is trying to leave the city in the later half of the book so his observations seem like wasted space.<br />e) You must read the next book to continue the story. By the end of this book, so much is left unresolved that you can't just read this and stop (unless you are hating the book and can't bear to continue...but I doubt that will happen). This book really felt like a 260 page introduction necessary to set the stage for a greater story.<br /><br />4) CONTENT: This is an adult book. It is equivalent to a rated R movie due to sexual situations and nudity. It is not overly descriptive but leaves most to the imagination, if one so wishes to continue to entertain such thoughts. So if you are opposed to this type of stuff, then know it's in here.<br /><br />OVERALL: Engrossing fantasy read that refreshingly departs from the typical: boy meets wizard and discovers he is a conduit of powerful magic that is needed to save the world from invasion by the evil hordes. That doesn't happen in this book and thus you feel compelled to keep reading into the next book...which I'll get my hands on shortly. You won't waste your time here.here tangents.

US	51979649	R13BDIYUO7FCGM	0812530756	818511748	Liege-Killer (The Paratwa Saga, Book 1)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A very good read	STORY: As one editorial review so nicely summariezed: &quot;Two hundred years after Earth is devastated by nuclear war and genetically engineered Paratwa assassins, the humans of orbiting Earth colonies are at peace, until a series of murders reveal the reemergence of the Paratwa.&quot;<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING - Prior to the destruction of all life on Earth, humans left for the stars. One group took off into spaceships headed for another solar system. The other group onto the colony capsule that orbits Earth. The later is where the story takes place. The colony capsule is 76 miles long, which is big enough to sustain different regions and groups. I had just come across a real-life group called the Lifeboat Foundation. Thus the setting seemed very plausible and real. It worked well for this story.<br />2) CHARACTERS - Our group of protagonists are likeable and plausible. Nick is my favorite character, but there is something to admire in each of them. The antagonists as gathered from the story description are a group of genetically created assassins. The Paratwa are very cool and deadly. The characters work well together in this story.<br />3) STORY - The only reason I gave this story a 4 star (very good read) vs. a 5 star (great read) is because of some of what I felt were long sections of exposition needed in order to explain man's history and how he go to this point in the future. Other than that, the story had plenty of intrigue, action and suspense. The author does give things away by page 122-125 out of 460+ page book. This worked for the most part because as characters came on stage there were two you kept looking for hints at to see which one was the &quot;real&quot; bad guy.<br />OVERALL: Fun read within a great sci-fi setting. It is not necessary to read the next book as this story resolved 95% of all plotlines. I've read that it the next two books are a bit of a let down anyhow. Nevertheless, get your hands on this book.	2003-08-24

It lets you roll your base stats as many times as you want to sit there. Thus you don't have to settle for that character with a 3 str if you don't want to, but then again some of us are up for the challenge.<br />The library of books is the right collection of all the necessary core books that an adventureres would need.<br />The map generator is ok. I wanted something more but this functions for most new adventures. The tool(s) are better for creating wilderness adventures and take a lot more patience when trying to create a town or city. I actually used it to help me run a Palladium:Rifts adventure...a town or wilderness is a town or wilderness. The map is a functional tool.<br />For those that don't want to bother with 3rd edition and get back to some using 2nd edition, this CD-ROM has all the necessary materials. It is especially useful if you have a laptop because you can bring the laptop to the gaming session vs. have to lug 12+ books with you. Much lighter. :)<br />I would check on ebay for the best deals on this software. But it is worth getting if just to have.	2003-08-24

Sound Effects were clear, loud and you could feel the room rumble when the earthquake hits = strong point. Voices kept fading into the background or were too low to hear what is being said = weak point. If this part wasn't so bad I would have given this production another star but even with the volume set at max it was hard to hear key scenes of dialogue.<br /><br />2) Acting - actors were great! Nuff said.<br /><br />3) Story - It was good. Because of the quality of the sound and voices I'm not sure how the story ends since it was so hard to hear some of these final key moments. But I liked the overall concept.<br /><br />OVERALL: I hear the CD version is pretty good so I'd opt for that if you can and avoid the audiotape version.

Enter Jack Forman, a recently unemployed writer of predator/prey software, whose nearly absentee wife, Julia, is a bigwig at a tech firm called Xymos. When a car accident hospitalizes Julia, Xymos hires Jack to deal with problems at their desert nanotechnology plant. The techies at this plant have developed nanomachines, smaller than dust specks, which are programmed with Jack's predator/prey software. Not only is a swarm of those nanomachines loose and multiplying, but they appear to be carnivorous.\\"<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING - Silicon Valley is where things originate. Believable and functional for this story. Nevada is another local and it too is necessary and logical. The setting is something most of us can envision and/or relate to.<br />2) CHARACTERS - Our main protagonist is the image of many men in America today = unemployed by the high-tech field, finding dead ends to job leads and trying to help out in the household between job searches. This character and the rest are easily believable and give us enough sympathy for thier plight that there is a connection. Actions are logical and in character.<br />3) PLOT - This is where the story lags in my opinion...The reason I don't read Tom Clancy is due to the pages and pages of technical explaination that go into his writing. This book suffers from the same plague of too much exposition. The \\"conflict\\"/antagonist isn't very easily explained like in the Jurassic Park books so more pages are needed in order to give the reader a surface understanding of what is going on with the out of control technology. Based on other reviews it appears this is the biggest turn-off for most readers, myself included.<br />The rest of the story is ok regardless of any formularic plotting involved. The level of suspense is not near that of T-Rex or Raptor for me even though the reality of nano-virus should be more fearsome. IT is almost analogous to give me a live terrorist or show me a facility that manufactures bio-weaponry. The \\"physical\\" threat seems more urgent in such cases in my opinion, regardless of how naive or misguided that might be.<br />4) AUDIOBOOK READING - the reader of the book does a fair job. Descent acting throughout. He does not make use of acting in different voices in order to dramatize the reading more, but it wasn't necessary.<br />OVERALL - Go and read Timeline by Critchon...it is a much better book. You don't have to waste your time, but any true fan of this author will still probably want to read it just to say they've read everything by him. Good luck.reality of nano-virus should be more fearsome. IT is almost analogous to give me a live terrorist or show me a facility that manufactures bio-weaponry.

But of course that wouldn't do for the publisher and the need to meet a page quota.<br />2) I felt he used more stories than he did scripture to support his points. This left me wanting more meat and less milk...if you know what I mean.<br />3) I got the point already by the third or fourth example...oh, wait...I hit that point already in #1 of this part. *wink*<br />4) He doesn't pull any punches but to me most of the chapters were plain common sense (i.e. spend quality and quantity time with kids). Thus even if he doesn't pull any punches there isn't a lot of power behind them to begin with.<br /><br />I have a few other books on my shelf from authors like Dobson who I hope will raise the bar on the content. I could see how this may be useful for someone who have walked away from the Lord or don't know the Lord. It wasn't nearly as challenging as the Man In The Mirror book, and I cannot see how this can effectively be used as a bible study curriculum.<br />Just my two humble cents worth.	2003-08-19

This book is ok.<br />It talks from a top-down viewpoint instead of getting into the nitty-gritty of plotting.<br />A very large portion of the book is in Tobias sharing pieces of literature as examples to support his ideas/story analysis. This was good and bad. Good because it seemed to give credibility to what he was saying but Bad because if you remove the examples he could have presented all his points on two or three pages.<br />He touches briefly (even with an appendix in the back) on the 36 different plot types. Interesting thing is fours years later he writes a more detailed book entitled, 20 Master Plots. What happened to the other 16? His second book is better in my opinion when it comes to planning what type of story you want to write from a theme/strategy point of view.<br />I would recommend the Marshall Plan of Novel Writing or The Weekend Novelist if you want a very structured, detailed approach to plotting. Use the Tobias books for overall concept but don't think you can use it to help you create a major plot piece. This is a great book for beginners, but I'd check your local library before dishing out the bucks for this hardback.	2003-07-30

STORY: Stanley Yelants IV is wrongly accused of a petty crime and sent to Camp Green Lake juvenial facility to work out his term. At this camp, that is neither green nor has a lake, he finds friendship, self-confidence, and dreams.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK<br />1) SETTING - unique setting the allowed for easy conflict and a great backdrop for characters to build relationships with each other. Very nicely done.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS - I felt a little let down here. After reading all the other reviews my expectations were really high. And once I read the book I only felt a liking for Stanley and Zero but not really the other cast of characters. The biggest reason why I liked Stanley and Zero is for the friendship elements that reminded me of the movie Stand By Me.<br />BUT Stanley as the main protagonist doesn't seem to go through a very large amount of change as a person...thus I'm confused why people think it is more than a good read and should be treated like a great read.<br /><br />3) STORY - There are actually two story lines that in the last few pages of the book merge together into present time. One story line has to do with how the area of Camp Green Lake came to be and the history and mystery of the characters and events around that. The second story line is as mentioned...the story of Stanley in his juvenial prison. It was nice that things came together and linked together towards the end but I didn't feel it had the same emotional rush as when I read The Giver by Lois Lowry.<br /><br />OVERALL - A good read but not so great that I have to rush out and see the movie. Very easy read, because I finished this in like two or three hours. The book is good enough that you won't waste your time if you pick this one up.	2003-07-25
US	51979649	R198RWGTHSWUYI	0812524802	688034485	Moving Mars: A Novel	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not my kind of story but very well written!	STORY: As one editorial review nicely put: &#34;a revolution is transforming the formerly passive Earth-colony of Mars. While opposing political factions on Mars battle for the support of colonists, scientists make a staggering scientific breakthrough that at once fuels the conflict and creates a united Mars front, as the technically superior Earth tries to take credit for it. Backed against a wall, colonial leaders are forced to make a monumental decision that changes the future of Mars forever&#34;<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />**I have to make note here of some things commented on by other reviewers. Yes, the &#34;action&#34; doesn't get going till much later in the book (around pg300. Ack!!). But if you hold on till then, then you'll find a very awe inspiring concept that develops. If I hadn't read the other reviews before reading the book, I would have abandoned the story very early on.<br /><br />Here is a quick rundown of what you'll find:<br />pages 1-50 = introduction of major characters (typical)<br />pages 50-115 = the romance between the two major characters<br />pages 115-260 = Casseia Majumadar's rise to political power (a lot of politics covered here...great if you like that kind of thing)<br />pages 260-290 = lessons in theories of physics for you brainiacks that like that kind of stuff<br />pages 290 to the end = a marvelous turn of events for Mars and those that call it home<br /><br />Yes, several times during the earlier stages of the book I was wondering, &#34;Where is this story going?!?&#34;. Many scenes seemed unnecessary and just fillers that the author needed to add in order to meet some sort of page quota.<br /><br />This is not my cup of tea. But it is so well written (even the political science portions, and I hate political science) that I had to give it a good rating.	2003-07-25

STORY: As one of the editorial reviews so nicely put: &#34;In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his Utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of Brave New World, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price.&#34;<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK<br />1) SETTING - The story takes place in a made-up utopian community that seems to exist in Earth's future at some point. The setting really is a huge part in understanding how this community has isolated itself through choices, in order to have the &#34;utopian&#34; society they have. It was very interesting and could be imagined thanks the the author's descriptions.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS - The character's play the parts they are assigned like the people in the community take the job they are assigned by the community leaders. There are no questions or variance from these roles because that is all the character knows. The character of Jonas is the one that breaks this mold and is the focus of the story. As he learns what his society is missing he grows as a character to be liked even though he isn't following the standards of practice that his peers are. His character becomes increasingly gripping especially in the last twenty or so pages of the book when he starts to act on his new found knowledge in response to the contradictions he has been brought up with all twelve years of his life.<br /><br />3) STORY - At first I was reading this as the authors viewpoint of what a Utopian society &#34;should&#34; be: Euthanasia, abortion, clothing is a bother, be in touch with your personal self, pills to control sexual desires, controlled and numbered births and marriages each year, etc. Then I came to realize that the society the author creates is not necessary her viewpoint but simply the concept created by the architects of that particular community. Each community is a bit different depending on who configured them. But all in all, in order to live in a place without poverty, starvation and crime there are some major things each and every community gives up. This is the crux of the story and what really drives the climax and conclusion.<br /><br />OVERALL - I picked this book up because I heard that a famous scriptwriter was contracted to do the screenplay for this book. It is an easy read and less than 200 pages. The story leaves you thinking about it hours later. I could not read the last ten pages fast enough!! The story just built up to this phenomenal climax and conclusion that had me ripping through the book to the next page because I had to find out what happens. I got this book at the library and now I have to own it so I can read it at least five more times.a, abortion, clothing is a bother, be in touch with your personal self, pills to control sexual desires, controlled and numbered births and marriages each year, etc. Then I came to realize that the society the author creates is not necessary her viewpoint but simply the concept created by the architects of that particular community.

STORY: Dr. Ransom is kidnapped by two other scientists and wisked away to the world of Malacandra. His wouldbe kidnappers think they are brining him to be a sacrafice to the beings of that planet. What happens is an adventure of discovery and facing the truth about human nature, which forever changes Ransom.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING - C.S. Lewis just shines in his descriptions of new, exotic places and the beings that live there. His vivid details allow the reader to create a wonderful mental image of a world totally different from our own. Very, very nicely done.<br />2) CHARACTERS - The cast of characters consists of Dr. Ransom, Dr. Weston, Dr. Devine and the various beings found on Malacandra (sorns, hross, pfifltrigg and Oyarsa). Every character has a purpose and is allogoric of something greater, which is sometimes clearly demonstrated and at other times left to the reader to interpret. At no point was I bored or upset at stereotypes when reading about these characters. Even if you don't see the allogories they represent they are still intriguing and unpredictable.<br />3) STORY - I read somewhere that this story is a retelling of the Christ story from the Bible. I didn't see that. Yes, there were some similarities such as the Bent One could be Satan and his fall from heaven. Otherwise, just reading the first book I didn't feel like I was bring preached out or given a Bible Study of any type. It was an intriguing sci-fi story of discovery.<br />Also, like many secular sci-fi books written prior to 1950, this book makes clear commentary on human society. In other words if someone puts this book down because of the social commentary then that reader is unfamiliar with such literary trends as mentioned. I did prefer this author's handling of social commentary more than other authors of the time that I've read.<br />Lastly, the book is written very well. Many times I felt like I was reading poetry instead of a sci-fi novel. C.S. Lewis' professional handling of the written prose is very, very enjoyable and appreciated.<br />OVERALL - I can't think of anything wrong with this story. It had action, a mystery, suspense, discovery, aliens, space-flight, characters true to their nature, social commentary, allogory AND all this squeezed into less than 160 pages. In many ways this books ends with most of the story resolved so there doesn't seem to be an immediate need to read the rest of the trilogy. BUT...if you like this first book like I did then you'll find very little reason not to rush out and continue reading right away.

Each chapter/section builds on the one before it with exercises to reinforce what was just presented.<br />2) Content - Looking back at what the dust cover publicizes, I'd say it is 99% accurate and no bull. The best part of the book for me was how logical the content was presented which made it easy to grasp and follow for an analytical mind like mine. The book is all about focusing on the components of a story = Conflict (want + obstacle) + Action + Resolution. He gets indepth on these but no so much that you get lost or bogged down with details.<br />3) Usefulness - First of all, this is the first book I've read that explains how you can easily turn a short story into a novel by simply adding more characters. More characters = more conflict = more scenes = longer story. Secondly, I feel one of my weaknesses is ending a darn piece of writing (lacking a solid resolution). After reading this I feel I can now identify how to correct this problem. Thirdly, this book helped me identify feedback I was receiving from writing groups on how my stories weren't having enough &quot;umph&quot; to them. This book helped me better understand how I can identify if I have all the correct components in my scene or story to create proper dramatic movement. Fourthly, great advice on how to tackle those rewrites and edit phases of one's work. It seems so easy now and less cumbersome. Lastly, he really gets down to the nitty gritting of writer's block and how to overcome this. Great chapter!!<br />OVERALL: Great book. Even though I got this at the library and have already read it, I want to buy it and read it over and over again.

STORY: Fourteen-year-old orphan Jack Morgan,is on the run and finds himself hiding out on an unoccupied planet, his only companion an artificial intelligence programmed with the personality of his con man uncle Virge. Jack unexpectedly meets Draycos, a dragon-like K'da, sole survivor of an advance team of K'da and due to circumstance the two must form a symbiotic relationship in order to survive and find out how to clear Jack's name and get the police off his back.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING - The title of the book brought expectations of a fantasy novel to mind so I was nicely surprised to see it was a sci-fi story. We get little peeks into an alien planet (it doesn't feel too alien though), space station/community, and a luxury space yacht (made me think of Fifth Element). The world is given very little detail but what is given is functional and entertaining. I look forward to the rest of the series fleshing the universe out a lot more.<br />2) CHARACTERS - I like our three protagonists a lot. Each one has thier separate voice and brings along individual strengths to the story. What is the appeal of the book is the growing friendship between Jack and Draycos. Nicely done.<br />My only complaint is that Draycos seems overly powerful to the point that it becomes almost too much to believe...even for an alien race.<br />3) PLOT - Here is where I knock things down from a 5 star to a 4 star. First of all, the story read fast and easy and before you know it you are done with all 250 pages. That is good. What is bad is that it feels like one big prologue (which it kind of is) to a much larger story, thus it leaves very little (almost nothing) resolved. How much longer do we have to wait till the next book comes out to hopefully resolve some of the story??? I hope not too long.<br />Also, Jack at one point goes on a &quot;mission&quot; on a space yacht...he and Draycos seem to do the &quot;impossible&quot; way too easy.<br />I did like the descent plot twists and turns. It was enough to keep me turning the pages.<br />OVERALL: This is my first Timothy Zahn book. It was a fun fast read, just perfect for summer when it is too hot to go outside. The story makes you want more but who knows how long you'll have to wait.

STORY: Richard, son of a trader and a simple woodsman, finds himself as part of a prophecy to save the world from the evils of Rahl. With the help of Kahlan (a woman he can't have) and Zedd (his old mentor) these three become the force that must strive to turn the tide of evil washing over the entire world.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING - A nice imaginative world separated by the Boundaries and filled with all kinds of dangers. Great monster creations, though some of the escapes the characters make are a little too easy. The ruling class of a queen/princess was nothing new, but the roles of Confessor and Seeker were a nice change of pace and added to the strangness and mystery of the world.<br />One complaint was the Mud People - his pseudo American Indian culture was pretty hokie and I was about to skip forward a bit when the author probably realized the same thing and changed the pace of the story. Whew.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: It just seemed a bit too coincidental that Richard is the last of the Seekers and Kahlan is the last of the Confessors and Zedd is the last of the wizards. Also, Zedd was way too cliche (just think of Ben Kenobi's relationship to Luke)<br />Reasons why Richard and Kahlan can't experience their love was a nice and intriguing major conflict in the story.<br />The only character that &#34;grows&#34; in the story is Richard, but there are reasons for that. The entire span of the story  covers less than a year so there aren't major changes to be expected by characters like Kahlan and Zedd who are use to more strange experiences than Richard.<br />A complaint is that the dragon gets corny at the end...especially the way it talks to Richard and has this sudden bond with him. It didn't do it for me.<br /><br />NOTE: When you get to the part where Richard is being tortured you may have the same reaction I did and cringe and want it to end but find it lasts for many pages...there is a reason for it,which is explained and it makes for more foreshadowing of how Richard is going to become something more in future books.<br /><br />3) STORY: I was hooked right off the bat and was surprised when I had read 400 pages and didn't know where the time had gone. The story moves at just the right pace and just when you might get tired of a scene/location/character the author introduces some new interesting magic, monster or situation. I tried reading Dragonbone Chair from Tadd Williams and both times felt like was was sloshing my way through the swamp of names while the mud of details kept trying to pull me down and drowned me. I didn't feel that way with this story. The reading was very easy and so where the names...though Richard hardly seems an appropriate fantasy protagonist name.<br /><br />Yes, the story has some VERY telegraphed plot elements (I totally figured out who Richard's traitor is very, very early on). But I realize this is the first book in a long series and it is necessary to get introductions done, setup the world a bit and have our protagonist grow a bit.<br /><br />OVERALL: There are some sex and torture/violence scenes that I would not recommend for kids or teenagers. It was a nice summer read when you are relaxing by the pool, beach or garden with a cold drink in your hand. When I look at some of the reviews where people slam the book, I have to agree with some of their points and in turn would rate this a 3.5 stars. But, like many, I enjoyed this fast read and I really got caught up in some of the scenes and relationships, which is why at times I rate this a 4.5.foreshadowing of how Richard is going to become something more in future books.<br /><br />3) STORY: I was hooked right off the bat and was surprised when I had read 400 pages and didn't know where the time had gone.

Racial prejudices abound as this slave is used as a pawn in the prince's schemes to manipulate and offend everyone around him.<br />It is the abnormal acceptance of ambassadors of a rival empire that begin the adventure and friendship between the prince and his slave. As things progress, the realization of Seeyone's true power as one of the last magic users of his race, the Ezzarians, begins to come to fruitrition as consipiracies and plots within plots unfold in an attempt to take control of the throne away from Aleksander.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) SETTING: This is a fantasy world like many others where there is a king, prince and all those that wish to take control of the throne. Magic is discouraged by the &quot;church&quot; and prejudices are common depending on the race of the person. Functional setting that didn't use the typical elf, dwarf, orcs, and goblin races. This new setting is nothing really special, but it wasn't meant to be more than that. It worked.<br />2) CHARACTERS: This is where the story truely shines. From the first few pages you are gripped by the characters of Seeyone and Aleksander. They are complex characters who pull out some surprises here and there. Their growing friendship is believable and necessary for the story. Well constructed and enjoyable to read.<br />3) STORY: Some turn of events were expected and predictable as other events unfolded, but overall it was a refreshing story of friendship, loyalties and happy endings. Some fair twists and turns and close calls helped to make things more interesting. It isn't necessary to read the next two books because everything resolves itself by the end of this one.<br />OVERALL: I loved this book for the characterization and its compelling story of friendship. You won't waste your time if you get this one.	2003-06-17

Magiere is tired of such a life and without Leesil's knowledge buys a tavern on the coast announcing to him that she is retiring and he is coming with here. Little do either know, that the little coastal village where they are headed is a nest of vampires. Through the story Magiere finds out she is specially equiped to fight vampires for real and not pretend. Aided by Leesil, their &quot;special&quot; hound Chap and some townsfolk they fight for thier lives and future dreams.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) Setting - Could have used a map of the world. Each time a place is described I wanted to start drawing so I can get in my head where every city, town, or region is in relation to the others. This fantasy setting only has humans, quick reference to elves and of course vampires...no other races or monsters referred to. With that said, I didnt feel at any point that the story needed these things, YET. There is so much room for the authors to take and create a more vivid world. What they've created here is a functional envioronment that is very small in scope and works for this first story installment.<br />2) Characters -<br />  a) Protagonists - I really liked the three main protagonists: Magiere, Leesil, and their hound Chap. Each had their strenghts, weaknesses, and secrets. It was a nice twist that all three have travelled several years together, yet there is so much they don't know about each other or themselves. Nice character growth and relationships through the story.<br />  b) Antagonist - The best thing about the vampires is that each one comes into his/her mental abilities differently. The authors played up on such strengths which helped define the individual vampires from the rest. Overall, the authors kept to most classic forms of killing vampires (garlic, stakes, etc) which was totally acceptable.<br />3) Story - Great Action! Believable dialogue and decisions made by characters. The story is written to be the first book in a series. The nice thing is 98% of all story conflicts are resolved in the end so even if they never get around to writting more in the series this book is a self-contained story. No real major plot twists and turns or comments on society and life...it was simply a straight forward action story, which was ok with me.<br />OVERALL: If you like what I said above, then you won't be disappointed by getting your hands on this book. I'm keeping this book in my collection and recommending it to friends. Fun story that I read in two-day's time. I'll be looking for any future installments of the Dhampire series.le dialogue and decisions made by characters. The story is written to be the first book in a series.

US	51979649	R2Q271RN7UW2SP	0553262505	826884658	A Wizard of Earthsea (The Earthsea Cycle, Book 1)	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A very different type of book	THE STORY: is about a reckless, awkward boy named Sparrowhawk who becomes a wizard's apprentice after the wizard reveals Sparrowhawk's true name. The boy comes to realize that his fate may be far more important than he ever dreamed possible. Readers will witness Sparrowhawk's moving rite of passage--when he discovers his true name and becomes a young man. Great challenges await Sparrowhawk, including an almost deadly battle with a sinister creature, a monster that may be his own shadow.<br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) This book isn't for everyone. The majority of the book is complete narration and very, very little dialogue. Some might find this borning and be tempted to skip to the next piece of dialogue. If you do, you'll miss 90% of the story.<br />2) I had no expectations going into this book except that it is highlye praised by the majority. Even with the long narrations it somehow captured my attention and held it there. Seeing the transformation of the teenager Ged through the story was the core of the book. Teenagers may relate and thus enjoy the story further.<br />3) Ged against a bunch of dragons. Way cool! Need I say anymore.<br />4) I agree with other reviews that Ged is really the only character we get to love and care about (Vetch is also likeable). Ged is the only character the author spends time on getting into the persona and motivations of. The postivie note is Ged as a single character does carry the story well.<br />5) I like how the world is made up of hundreds of little island townships vs. a large continent here or there. This added some nice man vs. nature conflict, as the battle with the wind and sea are a constant thing in this world.<br />OVERALL: Very quick and enjoyable read. You will not waste your time getting your hands on this because you'll know real quick if the narration style of writing is boring for you or not. I enjoyed it so well, that I'm excited to read the next book in the series.	2003-05-29

I have to rate both book 1&2 at once because they are one story and you can't seperate them.<br />Without rehashing the storyline like other reviewers, here are my two cents worth:<br />1) Con - Donaldson again has some looser characters that you find hard to like because they wallow (sp?) in their issues more than trying to work with thier \\"good\\" qualities<br />2) Pro - Donaldson does a superb job of realistically having every character play their part and appear to make their own decisions all the while being used as pawns in a grand game of chess. The decisions they make seem believable.<br />3) Pro - First book sets up the players and you can almost figure out who is conspiring with who by simply seeing the clues for yourself.<br />4) Pro - Book 2 is a VERY satisfying end to a grand story.<br />5) Con - This story I would not recommend for childeren. There is some explicit sexual material several times between the books.<br />6) Pro - the looser characters aren't such loosers in the end<br />7) Pro - Nice balance between the political intrigue and action fight scenes and magic<br />8) Pro - I found it to be a page turner of a story<br />9) Con - I found it to be a page turner of a story...didn't get my chores and responsibilities taken care of. hehe.<br />I would highly recommend this. I liked the story better than I remember liking the Thomas Covenant series...	2003-05-25
US	51979649	R1YGB5V5L6PZJ7	0553582909	199284738	Icebound	Books	3	0	0	N	N	One of my least favorite Koontz books	) John Glover reads the audiobook version of this story and like previous readings I've heard from him he does a good job. I always appreciate when an actor goes the &#34;extra mile&#34; to give different accents or speech patterns to different characters so that the audiobook come across more like a play vs. simply a reading.<br /><br />2) This is not the typical Koontz supernatural story. This is a man vs. nature story that would better play off the submarine movie crowd and/or natural disaster crowd instead of the normal Koontz crowd. This story seemed like a scaled up version of a screenplay or TV made movie and probably would have done better as a movie than a novel.<br /><br />3) Basically some scientist get stranded on an iceberg and need to get rescued. They have an unidentifiable bad guy in their midst in order to complicate things. A Russian sub is trying to rescue them but gets thwarted at each attempt. Story was fairly predictable and lacked a lot of suspense.<br /><br />4) On the flip side, Koontz has a couple of strong characters that help keep the story afloat and as the iceberg drifts to its conclusion so the reader in turn will drift along with the story. At points you'll want to dump this book but then you'll realize that you've invested time and need to finish things out.<br /><br />5) There were a couple of characters totally forgotten and given little if no attention for some reason. And the climax was formularic and in turn anti-climatical.<br /><br />It wasn't a terrible story, but it wasn't fantastic either. I'm glad I picked this up at the library and didn't pay money for it. Too bad because Koontz has some great books out there; Watchers being one of my favorite books to read and Tick-Tock being in my all time top three audiobooks to listen to.	2003-05-14
US	51979649	R1I91L4I3B2GS2	0441068804	887280747	The Blue Sword	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Loved it!	The story felt like the following but in a fantasy world:<br />--A British lady finds herself stationed with her foster parents and brother out in a far off African desert post. The lady finds herself swept away with the desert tribes by a brave, handsome, powerful desert king. She finds that legends and magic of old are calling to her as she rises to more than simply a hostage within the desert king's court. She finds herself a leader in a war against the invading horde of Northern armies that threaten not only the desert people but that of the British as well.--<br /><br />Kind of a female, fantasy version of Lawrence of Arabia.<br /><br />The story had a wonderful magical feel to it.<br /><br />The story progressed very well, leaving no part feeling short-handed nor the writing long-winded.<br /><br />Enjoyable characters with a sense of honor and loyalty<br /><br />Wonderful setting with just the right touch of details and description.<br /><br />My only complaint is similar to Hero & the Crown (story which takes place before this one in the world of Damar) in that the &#34;love&#34; story is forced and not built up throughout the book. Kind of like the author threw it in at the end just so the publisher could market the book as having action, adventure AND romance.<br /><br />OVERALL: I felt this book flowed better and was better written than the Hero & the Crown. If you can't read both books, it is totally worth reading this as a standalone novel. You won't be disappointed.	2003-05-12

I quickly found out why they had recommended this story. . .<br /><br />+ I totally felt swept away in the universe Vinge creates here. The sense of wonder and magic followed me with each page turn.<br /><br />+ The characters were complex, believable, and many likeable. Some reviewers criticize the book because Sparks isn't really a likable guy for a &#34;protagonist&#34;. I found Sparks' decisions and changes believable and explained in full by the author (&#34;the water of life creates madness in some they say...&#34;)<br /><br />+ It is NOT necessary to read the sequel, Summer Queen. I can't think of one relationship or conflict not resolved by the end of this book. I will pick up and read Summer Queen, because I want to know what happens next to our characters.<br /><br />+ I don't remember too much the story from 2003, but I remember ending the book with a great sense of satisfaction and awe. Thus I recently went to the used book store and bought it so I can read it again. I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />OVERALL: Get it! You won't be disappointed.	2003-05-02

This was enjoyable.<br />3) Yes, there is some romance in this story for those of you wanting not just a serial killer/cop book.<br />4) My only negative comment is that once you find out the motivations of the primary female detective you can figure out some of the story early on.<br />5) Great villian/serial killer. Also, nice pace in dropping the clues that help the reader try in figure out the mystery.<br />6) Great use of &#34;action&#34; scenes (medical emergencies) in where the the doctors respond to the emergency and SHOW characterization vs. the author telling us.<br /><br />OVERALL: Book is worth investing time in to read. It was enjoyable!	2003-04-29

Since so many other reviews tell you the story I won't bother with that here:<br />1) The reader of the audiobook did a fine job, very good acting. She did some voice changes for different characters but not all, which is ok because it wasnt needed.<br />2) Characters are believable and their actions consistent.<br />3) Plot was well put together with enough red herrings and other dislikable characters that you couldn't quite guess the real end to very late in the story. I figured out most of it about 2/3rds of the way through or at least had my suspicions...but that only encouraged me to keep reading to see if I was right or not. Nice pace to everything...at no point was an action-freak like myself bored and wanting more, even though there is very little \\"action\\".<br />4) The protagonist is a character one would want to read in another story. Strong female detective type with a sharp sense of humor and insight. Enjoyable and a character with flaws (not perfect physically and personality-wise)...what more could you ask for.<br />OVERALL: Worth getting into. Makes me want to check out more from this author.	2003-04-20

Robin McKinley does a fine job getting all the necessary components into this small space.<br />Pro - Enjoyable characters, interesting plot twists and a great world has been created<br />Con - Felt the \\"villian\\" was snuck in there as an after thought. Kind of felt robbed by this and didn't have a sense of real danger for our heroine.<br />Pro - Different outlook on dragons and how they pose a threat. Believable idea and entertaining.<br />Con - The romance story seemed forced and anti-climatic. Aeirn-sol doesn't seem to notice Tor at all because she is so distracted by her experiments, but at the end she suddenly \\"loves\\" him?!? Made for a forced happy ending.<br />Pro - Interesting and entertaining concepts of magic, who has it and how it comes to fruitrition.<br />OVERALL - good story, worth reading.

Felt the final conflict was a bit anti-climatic.<br />Con = the battle between the armies seemed poorly handled. There was no real stategy, flanking of forces, etc. It was one big crashing of two forces and seeing who wins. Kind of like a brawl vs. a technical boxing match.

Order vs. Chaos and how those two &#34;powers&#34; exist with one another<br /><br />Con - every now and again the author switches tenses with certain characters which throws off the flow of the story. Like feeling a spider crawling on you and you brush it away because it is irritating, but you still have some chills and goosebumps afterwards.

The main character doesn't have a &#34;real&#34; clue as to what he is to do next, neither did I as the reader. This was handled well, kept the suspense and kept me guessing<br /><br />Con - Like others have mentioned the emulating of sounds got old.

At the most, all I need to do are minor revisions on the template to meet my specific business need. This book is exactly like that. This is a template, a formula, that lays out one (1) suggestion on how to put a novel together.<br /><br />2) This is not a book about how to write great dialogue or develope charasmatic characters(even though there are tips on how to get some of this accomplished). That is what all the other books on the market are for. This book is a blueprint, the scene by scene layout of your novel's plot structure. He gets as detailed as stating the order in which the first 15 scenes (he calls them sections) need to occur and what characters need to appear in those scenes and what in general terms need to happen.<br /><br />3) This is the first book I've read so far that talks about multiple subplots and how to handle them. Thank you Mr. Marshall!<br /><br />4) Normally when I take notes on a book, I find that only 10% of the book is the core of what the author is trying to teach. The other 90% are examples to support the 10%. Examples to win you over to the author's viewpoint/opinion or examples to help the reader understand the point and see a demonstration of that example. This book is just the opposite. Mr. Marshall is  90% core material and very little examples. He explains his points clear enough that if you've ever read other books on the craft of writing, then your mind grasps the concept and has already filled in the example.<br /><br />Yes, when you get to this level of granularity it both shows that novel writing isn't glamours and full of spontaneous creativity. On the other hand, the formula breaks such a project up that it becomes doable, like eating an elephant one bite at a time.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />A couple of co-workers and I used this \\"plan\\" to outline our novels for NaNoWriMo 2011. If it wasn't for even the basic outline of what section should come next in a 3-POV story, I would have been stuck. It's now 11/30/2011 and I'm about to write my last 3,000 words for the challenge.

There were one or two scenes where the actor missed the correct voice and if it wasn't for the \\"Lito said\\" or \\"Gurney said\\" you kind of loose the pace during those scenes. Otherwise, the reader did a fine job!<br />b) The story was gripping! I normally can't stand unabridged readings but this one kept me enthralled from the beginning of tape 1 to the end of tape 10. Now more about the story...<br />2) Some will love it, while others will hate the transformation of some of our favorite characters from Dune. I personally felt the transformations were a love/hate relationship I had with the book. I too like to see my favorite protagonist succeed in the end, so the end result on a couple of characters was saddening. The redeeming factor is that there are new characters who come to life and step in, with all their glory and likeableness (is that a word?), to take the spotlight and continue the story.<br />3) I honestly don't remember getting any true sense of wonder from Dune Messiah. Children of Dune I definitely had that sense of wonder. The sense of wonder did at times borderline on huge disbelief but Herbert's explainations helped me through it...so I was able to forgive the author when all was said and done.<br />Because of feedback from others, after reading Dune I abandoned the rest of the series. Years later I picked up Dune Messiah on the off chance that it would be great and it was ok reading when you have nothing else that is seriously waiting to be read. That was like 7 years ago. With the upcoming Sci-Fi channel made movie called Children of Dune I had to pickup this story. I'm very glad I did and I'm very interested in reading the next book in the series now.	2003-02-18

The database is HUGE!! I can't believe the amount of work that went into creating this book. More choices for character tweaking than you can shake a stick at. This book gives you options!<br /><br />4) It is a reference book on my desk next to Timetables of History and Elements of Style.<br /><br />Last note...As a self-published author in 2013, I've since converted the Access database to Excel and have an easy, digital reference I can use to spark ideas for building my characters. Even if some of the items in this book are &#34;old school&#34; or archaic references, they do spark ideas!	2003-01-21

It isn't meant to be read from front cover to back but for you to jump around and use the sections you need.<br />2) I'm sure this book could be the size of six volumes but the areas the author chooses to focus on are well selected and very helpful<br />3) I'm finding that to keep some of my character true I can reference different aspects that make up a person and cut &amp; past them into something that makes sense, people can relate to and has some consistency.<br />4) Better understanding what drives an Obsessive personality or an Adventurer is opening up more plot options during my brainstorming session. This is a nice &quot;research&quot; book on people and what makes us tick.	2003-01-21

The reader did little distinction of voices, but you still always knew what character was talking.

The authors paces the clues and reveals the full story at just the right pace that it keeps you to the end.<br /><br />3) Very thought provoking which I enjoyed. Main character is so despairing that it isn't a &#34;happy/fun&#34; book but its not meant to be and that is ok. You have to be in the mood from something serious when you read this one.<br /><br />4) I felt the author could have done better with the &#34;science&#34; of the book and the alien races discovered.<br /><br />Overall opinion = worth reading or listening to.	2003-01-09

This book is the telling of how in the future in order to prepare for the alien threat combat schools employee doctrination and training in kids as young as 5yrs old. The kids are trained to eventually be the fighting force and the commanding officers down the road when the second wave of attacks come. This story is a rehash of Ender's Game but from the perspective of Bean. Here are my two cents worth:<br />1) First off, everthings I've read from Orson Scott Card I've thoroughly enjoyed. His prose and flow are very enjoyable and this book is no different. The fact that the author braves retelling the same story but from another character's perspective I tip my hat to him for bravery.<br />2) BUT...I really felt this book was too long at times. I felt the internal conversations Bean has just go on, and on, and on resulting in this being the biggest failing of this book.<br />3) No matter how much Card tells us Bean is super intelligent I really felt that the mental converstations Bean has are too mature. Intelligence does not beget maturity.<br />4) Reading the same story but from a different character's perspective wasn't as enjoyable as other reviewers make it out to be. It was nice to get Bean's background and see how he gets himself into battle school. But once he is there it isn't as intriguing and suspensful as Ender's Game. It would be better just to re-read Ender's Game over again for the battle school experience.<br />5) I do look forward to Shadow of the Hegimon (sp?) as this will be a fresh story with the same likeable characters.<br />OVERALL: I would have enjoyed this book so much more if I had read this one first then Ender's Game second. If you have a choice I think you will get a lot more out of Ender's Game and enjoy this book more than I did.	2002-12-16

Not as lively and entertaining as BD Wongs reading of Tick-Tock by Koontz or Roddy McDowell's readings of anything by L.

Even the audio book had it long portions<br />3) Interesting science and theories on controlling the aging process.<br />4) The epilogue was a fair wrap up of summarizing some answers to questions left needing answering. The ending is to me enjoyable and adds to the paranoid facination of the book.<br />5) Overall this audiobook was a fair book but if you have the option on reading or listening to something else then you won't miss out on anything if you bypass this one.	2002-12-16

This is a review of the abridge audiobook version:<br />1) The reader of the book did a very good job of having different voices and attitudes for the differen cast of characters. The acting was very well done!<br />2) The story starts of very fun and exciting...but then as one other reviewer put it,&quot;The long passages with Hiro and the Librarian are not only unnecessary, but incredibly tedious. Totally snooze-inspiring.&quot; I too could have done without all this and I was dealing with the abridge version...hate to see what people had to deal with when reading the unabridged version.<br />3) The future world created is fun, imaginative and interesting.<br />4) I love the lines in the book, &quot;Hiro Protagonist. What a stupid name,&quot; says Y.T.  &quot;Yeah, but you'll never forget it,&quot; replies Hiro. So true!<br />5)Overall the story made you want to find out what happens in the end and the end is statifying.	2002-12-07

Decent voice impersonations and emotional inflections. He did seem to lack a bit energy in the reading but then again his handling of the long Italian names left me impressed. ;)<br />2) This story of the Catholic Church kept me confused because I thought I was reading an Italian Mafia story instead. Maybe that was the author's intentions but it just didn't connect well with me.<br />3) I agree with the other reviews that Thomas Kind is the most interesting character in the book. Definitely someone to fear. Good bad guy creation.<br />4) The whole casual sex reporter woman, then not seeing her again for a long part of the story...then her being a key person in the resolution of the story was a bit too far fetched for me.<br />5) Overall if you want to read Allan Folsom definitely read The Day After Tomorrow...this story can be skipped unless you have nothing else to do with your time.	2002-12-03

This is the opening to a cat&mouse chase that leads all over Europe where our protagonist is sometimes the chaser and sometimes the chased as secrets are revealed.<br />NOTE: DO NOT BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO READS THE END OF THE BOOK THEN RESTARTS THE WHOLE STORY NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. You will hate yourself if you do so!! This story is intentionally meant to be read till the very, very last line!!<br />1) The book is read by Edward Herrmann. Mr. Herrmann does a very enjoyable reading, interspersing various charcter accents with appropriate voice inflections (fear, anger, etc) to help liven the reading.<br />2) Kind of annoying was the musical \\"interludes\\" that were meant to help increase the intensity of a scene. I personally found them distracting<br />3) I didn't get close to putting the clues together and figuring out 90% of what was really going on until very close to the end. In other words it was an engaging plot with a wonderful round of twists and turns.<br />4) Characters seemed 3D to me. They weren't all necessarily good or bad but function believably within the realm of how the author defines the character. Some of the actions were surprising that anyone would do this or that, but the author built up the characters background enough that it was believable for that character when you thought about it. This made it even more enjoyable as you didn't really know what someone might or might not do when put into a situation.<br />OVERALL: I had the paperback in my garage for many years after a recommendation from a friend that is was one of his all time favorite stories. I eventually \\"cleaned house\\" and this was one of the books to go. When I saw the audio version at the library I said, \\"Why not\\". I now wish I would have read the book version instead...I recommend it. I have picked up the paperback version of this since. :)his since. :)	2002-11-15

Ron Hubbard works. Different voices and more \\"acting\\" on the voice inflections of the characters (fearful, excited, nearvous, etc) would have made this a more enjoyable story.<br />2) A \\"popular\\" story that includes Ninjas? Yeah, right! Well, this is the case here...this is a very popular work but it is more of a crime-drama with a heavy emphasis on romance/pornography. Thought I'd mention this in case you have different expectations of what the story is about.<br />3) The ninja portion heightened the action and suspense as these \\"unstoppable\\" forces of good and evil work towards a face off. Anyone experienced (really experienced) in martial arts will get an appreciation of the power of the ninja characters and their art.<br />4) Can anyone say, \\"SEX!!\\" Wow! There was a lot here even in the abridged audio book version. Obviously not for everyone regardless if it is \\"more realistic\\" or not or however else it can be justified.<br />5) Some interesting characters...more is spent on the psyche of the \\"bad guys\\" and thus you can't wait to see what they do next.	2002-11-11

His voice inflections appropriately matching the fear, excitement, etc. of the character is so well done. Not to mention his voice overs for different characters makes it easier to keep track of who is who.<br /><br />2) Very interesting and gripping story. Something of a supernatural flavor with demons and spirits...or so it implies. The story leaves you guessing until the end what is actually going on. The story is definitely one of the spookiest stories I've read (heard) in a long time.<br /><br />3) By chance my local library has 75% of their sci-fi/fantasy audio books all from this author. I've never been a L. Ron Hubbard fan but the more I hear his books the more I'm enjoying his fictional writings.<br /><br />This was more supernatural than sci-fi but in all the author's works the characters are interesting and engaging in this story.	2002-11-11

This is based on the abridged audio book version:<br />1) Definitely a high-magic type story...meaning magic is everywhere and some characters are very powerful. This may be a turn off to some folks.<br />2) No elves, dwarves, trolls, orcs or goblins in this fantasy story. This was a nice change actually. What you do find is kobolds, fairies and unicorns (of course).<br />3) Main character Ben Holiday is a likeable human in a magical world.<br />4) Meeks the \\"evil\\" wizard seemed too much a stereotypical bad guy. He was a bit boring in my opinion.<br />5) The rest of the cast (defunked wizard, \\"dog\\" man, and the offspring of fairies and wood nymphs) was an interesting change to the standard fighter, caster, theif combo.	2002-11-07

A professional actor/reader would have made this so much more interesting than King's droning voice. The Insomnia auidobook was much more interesting to listen to.<br />2) I quite midstream as the story just was confusing at times with little or no information on the world created. Some parts mirror our world and others don't.<br />3) The one thing I did like is that there was a real sense of dread around each bend. You didn't know what traps the Man in Black had laid for the Gunslinger and this is what kept me going at least to the mid-point.<br />I had become disenchanted with King's work about 7 years ago and this is the first thing I came back to since then. I felt disappointed to the point that unless I have three really good friends whoes' opinions I trust tell me to read a particular King book...only then will I give King another chance.	2002-09-20

CON - It seemed like not a single chapter had a complete list or summary but each chapter was a different piece to the puzzle leaving you wondering what you can or cannot eat. If she hadn't put the reference section in the back I would have be totally lost<br /><br />CON - Didn't need pictures of her friends and family...more before and after shots would have been more encouraging and useful<br /><br />CON - There are more taboo areas out there than just fat. For instance she doesn't address salt at all<br /><br />PRO - Easy to read and presented in layman's terms<br /><br />PRO - Takes the mystery out of why we gain or loose weight. I no longer laugh at people who order a hamburger and a diet coke, now that I understand how it's the sugars which impacts the body so drastically<br /><br />OVERALL - IT WORKS!! It literally is amazing...and without exercising.<br />First time I did this, I had already lost 10lbs in two months with counting calories and exercising 5 days a week. I stopped exercising and followed this plan and in two weeks I lost an additional 15lbs.<br />Second time I did this (a year later)...I've been training for a triathalon exercising probably 10hrs a week and bummed because I wasn't loosing any weight. Reduced exercise down to 3 hrs a week and started Somersizing...finally I'm loosing weight again.<br />Don't get me wrong...you need to exercise for your own overall health, but it really goes to show that weight loss/gain is tied to diet more than exercise and burning calories.<br /><br />Book I give 2 star due to poor presentation and organization. BUT because it works I'll give it another 2 star.	2002-09-19

But, he sounded like what I imagine John Corey sounding like which was great...especially durning the funny lines.<br />2) Yes, I did laugh out loud a few times...I enjoyed the humor very much.<br />3) The four hours of tape kept me interested because I had no preconceptions of what to expect. I didn't expect a thriller with lots of chases but simply a NY Cop uncovers a government cover-up. This wasn't the case and the simplistic plot allowed me to enjoy the characters more.<br />4) Complaint #1 - Geez, didn't know sex with strangers was that easy nowadays.<br />5) Complaint #2 - What is up with bad guys telling their plans first then shooting later? Then again how many stories have I read with the hot tempered warrior type or the serial killer who was abused as a child?!?<br />6) Enjoyable story...at one point I wished I had not listened to the audio version but had read the book instead.	2002-09-14

All I could think of are all the Late Night B Movies that so make VR an unattractive subject.<br />I got the audio version from the library on the simple fact that Ben Bova is an established fiction author. Suprisingly I enjoyed this quit a bit. The audio version had me anticipating what would happen next more from the story than from the reading of the story.<br />If the reading was done a bit more like acting things out I probably would have gave this a five stars. At least they had some different sounding voices for some of the characters but the reader's ability to switch between character voices had some flaws.<br />This story based on VR technology really did get my thoughts going on the dangers of other pieces of technology. Interesting and entertaining story.	2002-09-11

It really put a lot of things into perspective for me when it comes to making kids perform above their peers and what kind of skills they will need in order to continue to excel vs. survive...both of which are hard to seperate most of the time.<br />2) Fabulously engrossing story and characters<br />3) Non-stop tension and suspense from the first through the last chapters.<br />I didn't even try and figure out what was going to happen in the coming chapters and how things were going to work out because each page keeps you glued to the point that you loose yourself in what is occuring in the \\"now\\".<br />4) A book that entertains but REALLY makes you think when you stop long enougth to figure out what was just communicated. A book with a lot of depth.<br />5) Definitely in my all time top five novels!! I'm re-reading this again...probably sooner than later. :-)<br />I'm told to skip the rest of the series and head to Ender's Shadow...I did and that one isn't nearly as good as this one. This is still the best. A true classic.	2002-08-26

The main character is not a good guy and thus does things that most &quot;protaganists&quot; won't do.<br />2) I got hooked on Kane from the Wagner book Dark Crusade. Kane as a character does carry the entire story because he is so good at everything...and believably so.<br />3) I like how this book reveals a little about Kane whereas Dark Crusade didn't say much of anything. Kane's mystery still stands even after this read making you want more in order to truely understand who he  is and where he comes from.<br />Fun read. Wagner is great with action scenes and creates a wonderfully likeable &quot;bad guy&quot; type character here.	2002-08-14

I got bored with Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and I got equally tired of the humor here.<br />2) The language is like old King James with thee's and thou's...which made the reading a bit cumbersome.<br />3) I did like the idea of the demon being the main protagonist and how he deals with each strange situation is entertaining and did keep me reading through the story.<br />4) Good commentary on humanity and society.<br />5) It is a short, quick read even considering the language used  was slowing me down.<br />6) Not a bad read but definitely not what I was hoping for as my first book by De Camp.	2002-07-30

Unlike many books I read they are about 50% fully of examples. Examples and stories that prove the point are many times necessary and usefull but I really liked that he simply stated his point and moved on. Thus I read this book in about an hour and a half.<br />2) He hits on the major things we as Christian men should be doing. I believe if we are fulling our responsibilities then everything else will fall into place.<br />3) Don't mistake this book being short as not having value. Even though I read it in less than two hours I have about 2 months of planning of how to incorporate the ideas shared into my life or how I need to work at some new habits (or old habits that have been forgotten) in order to set the example for my kids.<br />4) Many times I'll read a book and not agree with certain parts of it...which is ok, since the key is that we learn and grow from some portion of what we read. In this book, every chapter presented I had no argument against and thus was left with a sense of responsibility that I could no longer avoid in certain areas of my life.	2002-07-29

This is very true of this author and in this grouping of stories. She creates this awesome warrior race but I can remember only three instances between all three books that had any chasing, figthing, etc. Really only one of those scenes made use of the awesome warrior race and that scene lasted only about one page.<br />4) A lot of potential to make this a five stars, but the author wimped out a bit.	2002-07-29

I enjoyed the different short stories that represented different times in the future. On one of the short stories I was really wanting that to be an entire novel instead of just a short story (Retrief was awesome!).<br />Similar to my review on Theives' World the stories are great but there are very thin threads tying it all together and no real following of a select group of characters.<br /><br />A good read and I hear that the rest of the books in the series are the same and just as enjoyable as the first.	2002-07-12

As a person who is 30-something years old I was looking for a change of pace from the \\"mature adult\\" sci-fi and fantasy books I normally read.<br />I found this little treasure in the young adult section of one of my used books stores and am sold that Christopher Pike is definitely worth a few more tries.<br />Great book! On section was truely suspensful and very little could be guessed as I read through the book. This left the end as a nice suprise. A great sense of building tension and mystery in what appears to be a totally innocent event but turns into something so much more.<br />SPOILER...Pike doesn't ever really tell you about the \\"bad guys\\" and what their origins are yet the story seemed totally believable in the midst of so many questions that needed answering. Great job Pike!	2002-07-12

The stories feel different enough and in different tones that this almost isn't connected by completely different from each other. Thus it felt like a bunch of fantasy stories...the connection was kind of weak for me (less one star).<br /><br />In my opinion if there were reoccurring characters (if there were I don't remember seeing them) then that would have been more enjoyable to me.<br /><br />This is a classic series worth checking out.	2002-07-02

Not everything is just &#34;assumed&#34; to be . . . the author actually does a little hypothisizing here and there.<br /><br />Yay! More Heechee technology. 'nuff said!<br /><br />I grew to like the character of Robin Broadhead even more than in the first book.<br /><br />Great imagination and a very easy read.	2002-06-24

I got overwhelmed and started loosing interest because there were just too many clues to keep track of.

The decisions they make seem believable.<br /><br />3) Pro - First book sets up the players and you can almost figure out who is conspiring with who without being told by the author in every case but by simply seeing the clues for yourself.<br /><br />4) Pro - Book 2 is a very satisfying end to a grand story.<br /><br />5) Con - This story I would not recommend for children. There is some explicit sexual material several times between the books.<br /><br />6) Pro - the loser characters aren't such losers in the end. . . some redeeming factors happen<br /><br />7) Pro - Nice balance between the political intrigue and action fight scenes and magic<br /><br />8) Pro - I found it to be a page turner of a story, though my wife struggled the first 150 pages of Book 1. After that she too was hooked.<br /><br />9) Con - I found it to be a page turner of a story...didn't get my chores and responsibilities taken care of. hehe.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this.

I've now found out that the story continues and I'll probably track these books down too.<br />NOTE: Though it is not much there is some VERY adult content in this book.

Other than this, the book had very enjoyable characters, kept you guessing when the good guys would finally catch on, and had some side-splitting humor. The only other irritation I had was the feeling that it this book was one big marketing ploy: 1) about a half-dozen references to other books(with the hopes to get you interested in the others); and 2) already mentioned the end feeling that resolution never happened. If these two things don't bug you too, then the book is a must read	2002-02-09

REPOST of an earlier review I did accidentally under my wife's name/account...she didn't enjoy it as much as I did because it was TOO suspenseful for her (can't cover your eyes like when watching a movie). :-)<br />Now that there is about 250 reviews already with an average rating of 5 stars I hesitate to even leave a review because so much has already been said. Plain and simple...one of the best, most exciting, page-turning books I've ever read. The suspense at times was too much to bear and I had to put it down, relax, then come back too it. One of my all time favorite books!!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I recently re-read this short review and got excited. so I went back and re-read the book.<br />I didn't like it as much for the relational interaction between the male and female protagonists, but the suspense still held it's own years later. It was a good read but no longer my favorite Koontz book, so I knocked it down from 5-star to 4-star.<br />Still worth a read though!!	2002-02-09

Lots of action but it lacked the balance of thinking things through or a true build up of suspsense.<br />Every character (and it felt like \\"every\\" one of them)had a level of pride to the point of everyone was wanting to fight whenever they felt slightly insulted. Each scene seemed a repeat of the previous one, where one would get offended the it would require a comrade having to hold them back...this got tiring after a while.<br />If the authors were really trying to portray such prideful characters realistically then the story would not logically have progressed because of so many egos at work and no decisions being made.<br />Good thing for us the authors take some obvious sterotypes and just keep them moving whether we believe they would or not.<br />There was some good comic relief and the story had all the other facets of a D&D adventure:<br />1) several races and the prejudices built up between races<br />2) lots of different locals to visit<br />3) high adventure, magic and dragons<br />So if you want something that doesn't stop to take a breath and let you ask yourself \\"Is this plausible\\" then this book is for you.<br />Don't get me wrong I'm more action oriented myself so I enjoyed the book enough that I'm going to read the next one.<br />I just feel that if you want a truely sweeping saga of a story then try the Riftwar saga by Raymond E. Fiest which starts off in the first book, \\"Magician: Apprentice\\"; or Barbara Hambly's Darwarth series starting off in, \\"The Time of the Dark\\".	2002-01-28

What I liked about this story is Rohan creates a concept that has so many possibilities that he could write and endless series of books off it(here he has written 4 so far). I didn't know what to expect next in the story because it was totally different then any other fantasy I've ever read.

At the same time how we can let the &quot;System&quot; bog things down and how much politics can be a hinderance vs a help in the face of tragic situations. Some very enjoyable characters and some great scenes of suspense. I didn't like this book as well as his first book, Term Limits, because I felt there weren't as many suprises...I was able to figure out what should happen next. Then again the story is based on the bad guys making an invasion plan based on knowing what reactions they could expect from the American politicians.

I was recommended this book by a friend and enjoyed it enough that I want to read some other works by Jack. Fantastic plot and believable characters. By the middle of the book it became a page turner. (Now here comes the spoiler)The problem with the book is: 1) left you wanting a lot, lot more. Talk about a major tease; 2) The climax to a building political and violent situation is a resolution that is totally cheezy and makes you feel ripped off. If it wasn't for these two things I would have given the book a 5 stars<br /><br />*UPDATE 2016**<br />I tried reading this again.<br />I thought the &#34;action&#34; happened much sooner, but I got 2/3rds through and it was still a lot of nothing happening. What? How is this such a different book than the first read through?<br /><br />Thus, you need to stick with it before they get inside the artifact and then things get very interesting.<br /><br />The ending still leaves me feeling the author had to rush it and threw something together for the publisher in order to meet a deadline.<br />If you want a discovery of an artifact book, read [[ASIN:0553287893 Rendezvous with Rama]] instead.	2002-01-14
