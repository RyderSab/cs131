Ann is the current president of NGS and a very experienced genealogist.  Her book addresses a lot of  a new genealogist's concerns: how to interview relatives, how to fill out genealogy forms, etc.  If  you are a new researcher, you will benefit from all her advice on basic topics as well as the sections on organization.  It is so much better to be organized from the beginning!  But for those of us how began research before the Internet was invented (Yes!  There was such a time), there are lots of good things to learn as well.  Do you have a personal business card to hand to people at libraries and conferences?  This is much better than trying to exchange addresses and phone numbers in a hurried manner.  You can even print some of your main surnames on the back so the recipient will remember why they have your card in the first place.  She also gives great ideas on creating a list of the research materials in your home library so you know what you have and won't buy a book twice.  The chapter \\"Objects of My Affection\\" has lots of great guidelines for handing family photographs and ephemera.  The book also includes a CD of the forms and worksheets, saving us the trouble of creating them ourselves.  We can use that time for organizing!	2004-09-07

He is a master at gleaning facts from newspapers, family tales, and other sources to illustrate his family stories, and this story of trying to find the truth behind a family tragedy taught me so much about putting together a readable family book.  I never even thought to look at weather reports to see what was going on the day someone was born, married, or died.  In his book, Dr. Colletta weaves everyday details such as the weather in with his narrative that give it a richness and immediacy.  Any genealogist who want to create a family history with more than names, dates, or places, should read this book.	2004-04-28

I had quickly learned that I was becoming involved in something more than looking at a census or filling out a chart.  Learning from others with more experience helped me develop my research skills and saved me from a lot of trial and error learning.  As genealogy has become one of the most popular pursuits, the need for guidance has grown, too.  The number of those \\"how-to\\" books has increased, but some offer more than others, especially since technology has come to play such a large role in our research.  This book fills a real need.<br />  From beginning with home resources to making use of all the technology available, George gives his readers 472 pages of first class advice and information.  The book is intensely readable, and the examples are clear and to the point.  Both the beginner and the advanced researcher will benefit from chapters on using the Internet, locating advanced records, and following alternate paths to find the records you need.<br />  One of the best features of the book is the chapter \\"Plan A Very Successful Genealogical Research Trip\\".  When spending the time, effort, and cash  to get to a research locality, we want to be as successful as possible.  Planning is the key.  George gives step-by-step directions to get prepared and uses practical examples to illustrate just how to do this.  I know I will be more successful on my next trip because of things I learned here.	2004-04-21

It is subtitled \\"A comprehensive list of local, state, and federal agencies and institutions and ethnic and genealogical organizations\\".

Most researchers working on American families depend on the federal census as a basic tool in constructing their family groups.  Knowing where to find the records, what information they can give you, and how to use them to your best advantage are all covered in this wonderful book.<br />Each federal census had its unique points.  Different questions were asked in different years.  Native Americans were listed  in various ways.  Some censuses asked for information on military service.  It is also valuable to know why censuses were conducted and how our ancestors viewed them. Did you know that, in 1790, anyone who refused to answer the census questions was fined $20.00?  That was hefty sum then.  The money collected was divided between the census enumerator and government!  This book has lots of facts like that which help us understand how the census and our families interacted.<br />As is true of all books published by Betterway Books, the volume is full of clear illustrations of documents.  There are also many examples and case studies that illustrate facets of the census and also give some humorous examples taken from actual records.<br />Everyone doing American genealogy will find this book invaluable.	2004-01-28

We have just added this 10th edition to the Genealogy Collection at our library, and I know it will be a patron favorite.  The 9th edition was 386 pages;  the new 10th is 880.  There are chapters on the United States, each individual state, and 19 foreign countries. The maps included are clear, gorgeous and in color. The individual chapters contain excellent lists of sources including published material and repositories.  Information is given on dates of county formation, parent counties, and record holdings.  Both mailing addresses and URLS are given.  The only drawback I found is that no listings are given for U.S. affiliates such as the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and U.S. Territories like Guam.  In the past, I have always steered patrons to ANCESTRY'S RED BOOK;  now I will be referring them to the 10th edition of THE HANDYBOOK FOR GENEALOGISTS.<br />Linda Pazics Kleback, Genealogy Specialist, Bay County Public Library, Panama City, FL	2002-12-03

YOUR GUIDE TO CEMETERY RESEARCH is a must read for all of us who take great pleasure in hanging out in cemeteries, clipboard and camera in hand.  This book shares information on locating death and cemetery records that was new to me and may be new to you as well.<br /> Beginning with \\"Records of Death\\", Sharon outlines a variety of sources for death information. Autopsy records, Family Bibles (and lots of ways to find these!), Bodies in Transit records, Burial Permits, and Coroner's Records are only a few of the topics included.  In discussing death certificates, a contribution by Katherine Scott Sturdevant proves that our belief that death certificates are primary proof of the cause of death may often be wrong!  (See pages 22-23.)  I also learned in this chapter that rural dwellers without access to a stone carver could order a tombstone from a mail-order catalog, Sears-Roebuck being one example!<br /> Since summer is one of our favorite cemetery visiting times, the chapter on \\"Searching A Cemetery\\" is very timely.  From the necessity to take along bug repellant to ways to analyze headstones, this chapter will help you get the most from your cemetery visit.  Sharon also gives safe methods for making tombstone rubbings and casts.<br /> Very helpful chapters are included on ethnic and religious burial customs which are critical in understanding the burials you encounter.  American burial customs are also covered.  Appendices offer great information on gravestone art, epidemics, and medical terms.<br /> The book is also very entertaining.  Betterway Books are always well put together with lots of tips, reminders, quotations, and \\"this happened to me\\" stories.  The photographs and illustrations are excellent, presenting a variety of tombstone styles and examples of records.  Throughout the book, you can hear Sharon's voice, and the voices of contributors, sharing the joys and tribulations of genealogists on the hunt. This is a first class book and well worth owning.	2002-05-21

She, her father, and I attended the described meetings, sent the mentioned flowers of support, contributed to CHOICE, and watched in horror as the ludicrous events accurately herein described came to pass.  We could not believe that an area we had moved to for employment and beautiful weather could have such ugly events happening.  Now after twenty plus years in Bay County, we know it wasn't a fluke but also know that other towns and counties face similar problems.  Encouragement of excellence, of careful and critical thought, and of the sheer joy of books was attacked here in Bay County, and anyone who cares about these issues in our schools should read this book.  It will both scare and inspire you.  My daughter went on to college honors, a master's degree, and is now head librarian at a girls' school where she is developing a superb collection including something new there -- a YA collection to be read for plesure.

Author Maureen Taylor offers detailed information on using clues in  photographs themselves to identify their subjects.  One example on pages 42-43 shows a street scene in Providence, Rhode Island.  Since the photo contains telephone lines, research can place the image after 1881, the year telephone service was introduced there.
