Chomsky's letters not only sketch how the USA government manufactured domestic consent for its foreign policies during the early 1990s, it also (perhaps intentionally?) adumbrates by demonstration the salient aspects of the \\"propaganda model\\" Chomsky and Edward Herman explored in considerable depth in their work *Manufacturing Consent*.<br /><br />As for the content of the work, I recommend that readers consult the excellent reviews by Chris Green (always, always read his reviews), Egalitarian, and \\"Reader\\" (10.10.99) on this page.  I couldn't possibly improve on them.<br /><br />One last observation: Chomsky resides in Lexington, but I can't help but wonder if the title selection plays on the historical significance Lexington has as the location for the beginning of the American Revolution.  Perhaps I am poeticizing the title.  Nevertheless, I am quite certain that this work will make the canon of literary political dissent as so many of Chomsky's works have already done.	2005-08-10

Consider the review by the \\"liberal\\" Alan M. Dershowitz printed in the right-wing reactionary FrontPageMag.com.  Why does Dershowitz find Shetterly's exercise in free speech so offensive?  Apparently because Shetterly, appropriately, lists among the heroes Noam Chomsky and Amy Goodman.<br /><br />I suspect that Dershowitz opposes Chomsky's inclusion because he still can't comprehend the possibility of an intellectual Jew unwilling to sacrifice his moral and intellectual integrity for the sake of the real estate aims of the nation of Israel.  And he might oppose Goodman's inclusion because her program (Democracy Now) occasioned Norman Finkelstein deconstructing Deshowitz's \\"The Case for Israel\\" on the 9.24.03 broadcast before Deshowitz's helpless eyes.<br /><br />Dershowitz opposes the book because \\"some of [the] hard-left radicals\\" the book includes \\"provided justifications for precisely the kind of violence that occurred on 9/11.\\"  This claim is laughably preposterous and Dershowitz knows it.  He knows perfectly well that \\"reasons\\" is not the same as \\"justification\\" logically, a distinction that the USA policy makers ignore at our own peril.<br /><br />Many will continue to write negative reviews of this book.

(\\"Delawares\\" was the name given by European colonists to the Lenape people.)  After reading many other books on the Lenape, Weslager's work remains the best book on the subject I've read.<br /><br />As striking as the exemplary research demonstrated in the book is its accessible style.  Cleary Weslager took great pains to make the story of the relatively unknown Lenape people available to as wide an audience as possible.  The book is a complete history of the Lenape, and its source material is oral traditions carried down by the Lenape, colonial records and writings, and 20th century records and personal narratives as well.<br /><br />Weslager also describes Lenape customs, ceremonies and beliefs.  His description of the Lenape Big House Ceremony is fascinating.  Weslager's accounts of the successive betrayals, deceptions and crimes of the European colonists and their American descendants track the disastrous trail of the Lenape from their original homeland to present day Oklahoma.  Readers can easily sense that Weslager's sympathies for the Lenape people border on advocacy.  Unsurprisingly, Weslager ends the book by describing the Lenape's attempt to receive compensation owed to them by the USA government for over 100 years.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and others by Weslager as well.	2005-02-26

(Arguably the civil war began in the 1940s.  The 1960s represent the date the rebel forces FARC emerged.)  Leech provides objective descriptions of the history of the conflict, the social forces and striking class divisions generating it, how the USA's imperialist interests and interventions aggravate it, the civil war's principal players and fighting forces, the widespread human rights abuses that debase the conflict, the criminal activities employed to finance it, and the many failed military and peace approaches to resolve it.<br /><br />I particularly appreciated Leech's analysis of the rise and role of the right-wing paramilitaries in Colombia, the staggering degree of homelessness and poverty created by the USA's \\"fumigation\\" program, and the USA's use of (what should be frankly coined) corporate mercenaries in the war.  Although FARC is the largest fighting rebel force in Colombia, I wish Leech would have provided more information about the ELN.  But, in this respect, Killing Peace is like most works on the Colombian civil war.<br /><br />My chief issue with the book, and others like it, is that it tends to analyze the prospects for resolving the conflict in terms of some equitable and just accommodation among the principal players (except for the paramilitaries).  But that's precisely the problem with this civil war: given the nature and extent of their human rights violations (including assassination, mass murder, terror, kidnapping, extortion, drug trafficking, etc.), it is doubtful the principal players are capable of fashioning and maintaining an equitable and just settlement.<br /><br />The book doesn't satisfactorily look at other options.  For example, the prospects for a resolution coming from the various social movements within Colombia as well as how other Latin American regional powers and interests could be brought to bear on the conflict.  Perhaps that hope is too thin for Leech, but it could very well be the only one available.could very well be the only one available.	2005-02-25

Although many readers know that the mafia-owned casinos and hotels in pre-revolutionary Havana became the \\"playground\\" for USA movie stars, politicians and other elites, few know the important and consciously understood (if not acknowledged) role the mafia played in preserving USA hegemony over Cuba.  Cirules does an excellent job in providing this information.  He identifies 12 roles the Mafia played in protecting the USA's and its own interests (pp. 96-97):<br /><br />1. Making Havana a major tourist destination controlled by the mafia.<br /><br />2. Making Cuba a major hub in the Americas for the distribution and use of illegal drugs (heroine and cocaine mostly).<br /><br />3. Making Cuba a center for \\"gaming industries\\": casino and racetrack gambling.<br /><br />4. Making Havana a center for trade in precious gems.<br /><br />5. Making Havana a center of prostitution.<br /><br />6. Making Havana a center of trade in illegal contraband.<br /><br />7. Creating a variety of wealth-generating \\"legitimate\\" business, everything from sugar mills to banks.<br /><br />8. Turning Havana into a financial hub to \\"legalize\\" huge illicit fortunes.<br /><br />9. Controlling the organs of mass communication in Cuba.<br /><br />10. Helping to administer Cuba's relationship with the USA.<br /><br />11. Helping to administer the Cuban governments intelligence branches.<br /><br />12. Making Havana into an operations center for the USA mafia.<br /><br />Cirules is careful to point out that the USA government's and mafia's interests in Cuba didn't always coincide.  But he does demonstrate that their interests often did (as should be evident form the above list), so much so that the reason the USA government employed the mafia to perform various criminal activities in Cuba after the revolution becomes apparent.  The USA and the mafia had been virtual partners in Cuba.<br /><br />Cirules also argues that various pre-revolution Cuban governments were so much under the dominance of USA and mafia hegemony that they never exemplified any meaningful interests of their own.  He even goes so far as to argue that in the last few months (weeks really) of the Batista regime, after the USA had cut off all aid and ostensive support for his government, Batista resisted the USA government's recommendation that he resign the presidency and allow a new (but decidedly non-revolutionary) government take power because this strategy did not accord with the interests of the mafia (pp. 142-143).  Although there can be little doubt that Batista was mostly a shill for the interests of others, I found Cirules' evidence unconvincing that Batista wasn't acting in his own interests by trying to maintain power.<br /><br />I want to end this review with a quotation by Cirules explaining why imperial powers never allow dependencies to become economically independent (p. 103):<br /><br />Imperialism would never have consented (and it never did consent) to [Cuba's] conversion into an economic power, not even one dominated by USA capital, because this would have created an internal market which, in its turn, would have fortified a national middle class, besides creating a powerful working class.  The policy of the Untied States in Cuba, from its origins, was directed toward impeding any resistance to the economic, political and social order; toward making the Cuban pseudo-bourgeoisie increasingly weaker, ever more subservient, ever more incapable and corrupt.<br /><br />It's the caliber of insights like that one which makes Cirules' book a must read..

He demonstrates that the high water mark politically occurred for leftists during the Eugene Debs' presidential campaigns.  As a candidate for the Socialist Party, Debs' campaigns not only garnered a substantial number of votes, but they also catapulted Socialist Party candidates into office from various local, statewide and congressional races.<br /><br />Not content to build on these victories, many leftists turned to founding, joining or endorsing various reformist-capitalist parties based mostly on the Labor Party movements in Europe.  The hopes and ambitions motivating their shift are quite familiar:<br /><br />·  The fear that leftist party politics would steal the margin of victory from more progressive candidates and, thereby, give the elections to more traditional or elite constituent candidates.<br /><br />·  The hope that successful USA labor-based politics would create the political and cultural environment in which leftist parties and their candidates could succeed.<br /><br />·  The desire by some leftists to trade their endorsement of labor-based candidates for a share of political power should the labor-based candidates succeed.<br /><br />Chester demonstrates persuasively that labor-based politics didn't succeed and leftist politics suffered from its compromises and stratagems.  Chester's prediction that future leftist politics in the USA can expect similar results when it makes similar compromises proves prescient.  The Green Party's 2004 \\"safe-states\\" presidential campaign weakened it politically and did not give John Kerry the margin of victory.  (Chester might not agree with this analogy since he rightly considers the Green Party to be a reformist-capitalist party.)<br /><br />Yet Chester doesn't adequately address another specter haunting the prospects for political power for leftist parties: viz., the legacy of successful slander of leftist political values made culture-wide by the red-scare and cold war propaganda campaigns.  Of course, this concern doesn't fall within the purview of his historical subject matter, but it is a rather large variable that simply cannot be overlooked in assessing the merit of leftists participating in the two-party system or in reformist-capitalist third parties.<br /><br />Although I have this reservation about Chester's analysis, I am giving his work a five-star rating because Chester has written a one of the most well-written, thought-provoking political works I've read and, my reservation notwithstanding, Chester could easily be correct.iz., the legacy of successful slander of leftist political values made culture-wide by the red-scare and cold war propaganda campaigns.

The history of Colombia's 40-year civil war (which, in fact, should be dated starting with the 1940s).<br /><br />2. The various government, rebel and paramilitary forces involved in the civil war.<br /><br />3. The intersection of the illegal drug trade with the widespread acts of crime and terrorism in the country.<br /><br />4. The policies that have allowed Colombian elites to appropriate the most productive agricultural lands and have driven peasant farmers into remote regions of Colombia suitable mostly for cultivating drug crops.<br /><br />5. The Colombian government's policy (at the USA's insistence and underwriting) of fumigating drug crop areas, forcing literally millions of peasant Colombians into homelessness and exile.<br /><br />6. The Colombian government's widespread repression (often murder by the paramilitaries) of dissidents.<br /><br />7. Colombia's natural resources and strategic importance in Latin America, which accounts for the USA's interest in the nation.<br /><br />Chomsky points out that USA tobacco production accounts for more death worldwide than Colombia's (or all other nations') coca and marijuana production.  He then asks: would we think another nation has a \\"right\\" to fumigate our tobacco lands, causing widespread homelessness and exile, because our tobacco products cause people to die in that nation?  Rather, wouldn't we think that nation should deal with its tobacco demand issues and not cause our people harm?  Of course we would, but it is not a logic the USA applies in the case of Colombia.<br /><br />This CD is quite good.

He begins by discussing the definition of terrorism, a task more difficult than it might seem.  He indicates that terrorism is often a matter of perspective since one person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. There are also questions about what counts as an act of terrorism.  Do intentions and goals make some acts terrorist?  Can a line be drawn at the kind of victims selected for a terrorist act?  Townshend looks at some laws that define terrorism, USA and British law (as I recall).  Even here we encounter problems because these laws could be applied to the actions of nations themselves.  In my view, state terrorism is inadequately addressed in this book; I suspect because Townshend lacks a useable sense of what it might be.  Yet I think that state terrorism is the easiest category of terrorism to define as well as the most pervasive form of terrorism in the world.<br /><br />Townshend provides many historical examples of terrorism.  They are all well chosen.  He discusses the origins of terrorism in history: viz., the first terrorist groups, the philosophical patrimony of \\"propaganda by deed,\\" assassination as terrorism and the terrorism during the French Revolution.  He also explores different types of terrorism: revolutionary, nationalistic and religious.  He ends by discussing counterterrorism as a strategy and correctly mentions the dangers inherent in such an approach.  Townshend apparently believes that democracies will always be hampered in their responses to terrorism because of their high regard for human rights.  Yet Townshend doesn't often discuss the many ways the \\"great democracies\\" have employed terrorism, either directly or through proxy forces, sometimes resulting in massive casualties, particularly in the third world nations.  Although the western democracies might have a public relations problem in using terrorism, they certainly don't lack the aptitude.<br /><br />If you want to read a short introduction to the topic of terrorism, then this will do...at times quite well.titude. <br /> <br />If you want to read a short introduction to the topic of terrorism, then this will do...at times quite well.   <br />	2005-01-14

(Working Classics)	Books	5	16	16	N	Y	Anarchism as Commonsense	Emma Goldman records in her autobiography that Berkman found *What is Anarchism* a difficult book to write.  He wanted to write a book that would explain anarchism to the average American.  Given that the average American misunderstood anarchism to be about throwing bombs, Berkman had to begin on a basic introductory level.<br /><br />He pulled it off masterfully.  Berkman takes a commonsense and conversational tone throughout the book, and he covers considerable ground.  He explains to readers how the capitalism is basically a system of wage slavery and he discusses the other great social harms it produces.  He differentiates left anarchism from western European socialism (a system of reformist capitalism) and from Marxist socialism.  In fact, Berkman often discusses the Bolsheviks in the USSR, who imposed an oppressive system of, effectively, state-capitalism that he witnessed first hand.  Other topics include trade unions, war, religion, violence, revolution and others.  Berkman is particularly effective in discussing how an anarchist revolution would not be one given to wanton destruction, that it would try to preserve as much life and infrastructure as possible.  And he sketches how an anarchist society would operate.<br /><br />Those who are completely unfamiliar with anarchism will find this book worthwhile.  Anarchists will also find this book helpful because Berkman shows how to explain anarchism on an intuitive level.	2005-01-13

Although we find such actions despicable,  the sad truth is swindlers and hucksters often exploit tragedy for personal gain.  Imagine, though, if our ire wasn't turned against those who are exploiting the tsunami victims but instead was directed at the reporter who exposed them.  We would  think that basic morality had been turned upside down.  We would say the idea is to be angry at the criminals, not those who expose them.  These thoughts made me think of Finkelstein and *The Holocaust Industry: Reflection on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering*.<br /><br />Any objective reader of this book will find the controversy surrounding it bewildering.  Finkelstein doesn't deny the reality of the holocaust; indeed, his parents were victims of it.  He simply argues that some individuals and organizations who claim to represent holocaust victims have exploited the tragedy for personal and political gain, particularly in the area of victim reparations.  If Finkelstein is correct, then hasn't he done us a service?  One would think so, but this book has created a whirlwind of controversy.  And most of Finkelstein's detractors don't disagree with him on the level of facts or conclusions.  Rather, they despise Finkelstein himself and most of their \\"replies\\" take the unmistakable tone of invective and ad hominem attack.<br /><br />Yet, as far as I can tell, Finkelstein makes no bald assertions in the book and he justifies his claims through painstaking research, considerable citation of  original material and detailed factual analysis.  If Finkelstein is wrong, it is on the level the details and their significance.  That is where this debate should be held.	2005-01-09

The plan involved the following elements:<br /><br />1. Extensive sabotage and terrorist campaigns including blowing up transportation and electrical facilities and burning down big clothing stores.<br /><br />2. Assassinating the leaders of various revolutionary organizations so that it would be blamed on the new government in Cuba.<br /><br />3. The Catholic Church in Cuba disseminating a phony law, supposedly proposed by the Cuban government, called Patria Potestad law.  The law would give the government of Cuba exclusive power over children, removing it from their parents.  But the law never existed.  It was to be written by the Church hierarchy and then denounced by priests from their pulpits throughout Cuba.<br /><br />Yet readers can examine \\"Operation Pedro Pan: The Untold Exodus of 14,048 Cuban Children\\" and find no reference to this CIA machination.  Instead one reads how the government of Cuba planned to take children away from the parents and to ship them en masse to the Soviet Union where they would be subject to unspeakable horrors.  Yet this book provides no evidence that this \\"plan\\" was anything more than a vicious rumor, if not an outright psychological warfare project, that resulted 14,048 children being estranged from the families.<br /><br />Although the book does catalogue some of the abuses many of the children endured, it hardly touches on the irony of parents sending their children away for fear that their children will be sent away.  Undoubtedly, many of these parents were sincerely frightened because they believed the rumor.  Yet many of the children of Pedro Pan did experience physical and sexual abuse, neglect, intimidation, and estrangement not only from their parents but also from their siblings who went to other foster homes and facilities in the USA.  Some children were eventually reunited with their families; others never were.  Still, on the whole it seems, most of the children ended up in homes where they received love and considerable attention.  They developed relationships with their foster families that have lasted throughout their lives.  Those accounts were quite moving.  Still, as other reviewers have written, the survey results and questions are so dubious one wonders how the author lacked the shame to include them in the book.

Apologists for the CIA and the terrorists among the Cuban exile community cannot dismiss this book as Cuban disinformation because the records provided here are CIA declassified files.  This book is the smoking gun.<br /><br />To read this book is to learn how hatred makes people not only violent but ridiculous as well.  Murdering Castro wasn't always the aim of each plot, although, no doubt, that was the would-be assassins ultimate aim.  At times they sought to embarrass and discredit Castro in ways that ranged from the childish and prankish to the sinister.<br /><br />There were plots to slip him LSD before one of his speeches so that he would laugh hysterically and discredit himself.  One harebrained analyst believed the secret of Castro's charisma lay entirely in his beard.  He proposed that thallium salts be placed in Castro's shoes so that his beard would fall out.  Imagine the insult to the Cuban people suggested by this plot: the Cuban people loved Castro not for his ideas and ideals but because they were captivated by his facial hair.  The contempt of the slur is only exceeded by the idiocy of the plot.<br /><br />I used to believe that Castro and the revolution in Cuba survived forty-plus years of USA overt and covert onslaught because of the intelligence of Castro and the guardians of the revolution. Not any longer, although that was part of it.  Another part--a huge part as this book demonstrates--is that the enemies of the revolution are imbeciles, made dumb by their hatred and unwillingness to accept that history in Cuba has moved past them.	2005-01-04

Al Qaeda had terrorist links to Iraq<br /><br />2. Iraq had chemical and biological weapons<br /><br />3. Iraq had nuclear weapons<br /><br />4. The war and the occupation would be easy<br /><br />5. Iraq is primed to become a model of democracy in the Middle East<br /><br />Of course, the administration still holds out official hope for the fifth lie, but it is also the kind of hope the USA could have for 20 years even as it continually battles an ever-renewing insurgency of Iraqi patriots who hate the USA.  Still, it is evident to the objective observer and from what we now know from the Iraqi people themselves: whatever the Iraqi people want for their government, it is not what the USA offers.<br /><br />The Bush administration floated a sixth lie when the mendacious nature of the first five became evident.  It is now claimed that the USA invaded Iraq for purely humanitarian reasons.  Yet Human Rights Watch (HRW) accurately pointed out that though Saddam was no angel, the widespread nature of his abuses ended by the early 1990s, most of them occurring during the 80s when the USA considered him an ally.  In fact, HRW argued that Saddam's abuses had declined so much that a persuasive case could not be made for militarily intervening in Iraq for humanitarian reasons.  Add to that the fact that approximately 100,000 Iraqi noncombatants have died since the USA invasion, and malnutrition has increased in Iraq since the invasion (at levels in excess of those while Saddam was in power), then it becomes clear that the USA invasion and occupation has been a humanitarian disaster and the USA has lied about this as well.<br /><br />If the authors decide to print another addition of this work, I urge them to include an analysis of this sixth lie as well.  This needs to be settled: the USA has exhausted its excuses for it monstrous acts of barbarity in Iraq.ixth lie as well.

We learn of his boyhood in Cuba, his flight to Miami as a young man, his financial successes and humanitarian work in Miami and the deserved notoriety he received.  We also learn about his secret missions to Cuba at the USA's behest, his frequent conversations and negotiations with Castro, and how his considerable accomplishments in these matters cost him dearly in the exile community, even endangering his life.  Although the author often strikes an oddly detached tone in his descriptions of the violent and inquisitorial nature of some elements of the Cuban exile community, he provides all the salient details and history.<br /><br />By book's end, readers are left wondering why Bernardo Benes isn't esteemed as a great hero in the Cuban-American community.  It is here we realize that the real main character of this true tale is the Cuban exile community, not Bernardo Benes, and how their grievance long nurtured by hatred, violence, and dogmatic conformity distorts a hero's triumph into heartbreak.	2004-11-12

Perhaps a broader analysis of the multiple national interests in the Cold War would give the work a dimension that could not qualify as a \\"very short introduction.\\"  But that doesn't seem to be McMahon's issue.  He defines the Cold War solely in terms of a conflict between the superpowers:<br /><br />\\"In brief, it was the divergent aspirations, needs, histories, governing institutions, and ideologies of the Untied States and the Soviet Union that turned unavoidable tensions into the epic four-decade confrontation that we call the Cold War\\" (p. 5).<br /><br />McMahon is quite good when he shows how the conflicts in the Cold War were principally played out through third-world countries.  He needs to discuss a bit more the frequent devastating effects the conflict had for the lives, prosperity, sovereignty and dignity of the people in these nations.  Multiple millions of people died as a result of the international chess game among the major powers.<br /><br />McMahon is one of the few writers to point out that Stalin offered the West a unified Germany with free elections as long as Germany was demilitarized (much like Japan was after World War 2) and was not a part of NATO, reasonable conditions given that Germany had invaded Russia twice in the 20th century.  But the USA turned down the deal thinking that an armed partitioned West Germany met the USA's strategic interest by providing an advanced front line abutting the Warsaw Pact nations.<br /><br />McMahon gets high marks for showing that it was principally the unilateral actions taken by Gorbachev that led to the end of Cold War and not, as in the USA propagandists' fantasy, Ronald Reagan.	2004-11-11

However, excepting the entries that use occasional awkward rhymes schemes, it is not always clear what is rant and what is poem.  Also, some of the entries are prosaic and lack emotional intensity to be rant-like or the syntactical intensity characteristic of poetry.<br /><br />I did find the poet's concerns sympathetic and I appreciated his attempt to give his anarchistic point of view poetic expression.

When an author refers to some event that ramifies to the relationship of Cuba and the USA, I check its date against the events during that period as chronicled in Franklin's work.  Often this deepens my understanding of the event I am studying or it indicates that I should understand the event differently from the author's description or interpretation of it.  I suspect Franklin intended her book to be used as a tool in just this way.<br /><br />Franklin's book is essential for any serious student of Cuban political studies.	2004-10-03

Yet somehow Visions of Poesy: An Anthology of 20th Century Anarchist Poetry manages to cobble together 267 pages of versification.<br /><br />I say \\"versification\\" because many of the entries do not qualify as \\"poetry\\" by any reasonable definition of the term except for their end-stopped lines.  The tragedy is the anthology's evident lack of poetic values unintentionally reinforces the erroneous notion that anarchism promotes chaos.  Quite the opposite in fact.  Anarchism promotes the order that results from mutual and fully-informed consent.  It opposes imposed order.<br /><br />Apparently, in their zeal to create the impression that anarchy generates considerable poetic activity, the editors have left the impression that anarchism hasn't produced much poetry that is worthwhile.  A much shorter work retaining the few gems this anthology contains would have benefited this work and anarchism better.	2004-10-02

That might sound overly poetical to some, but Calasso does write like the Platonic poet possessed by a Muse.<br /><br />For example, his discussion about the relationship for the ancient Greeks among beauty and necessity and necessity with the good didn't employ the usual distancing discursive approach.  Rather, he made the explanation visual by employing the very terms and relationships among the myths themselves:<br /><br />\\"As the years passed the leaves and the petals of beauty fell away, leaving only the cold fetter of the circle, unadorned necessity....In the girdle of Aphrodite, in the crown, in the body of Helen and her phantom, beauty is superimposed over necessity, cloaking it in deceit (p. 114).<br /><br />This book is stunning.	2004-10-01

If you let me live, I shall never stop crying for vengeance, and I shall avenge my brothers by denouncing the[ir] murderers\\" (p.101).<br /><br />So said Louise Michel before the court passed sentence on her for participating in the rebellion that became the Paris Commune.  The court did not execute her.  Instead, it sent her into exile at the prison colony in New Caledonia 20,000 miles from Paris. Even there Michel advocated for the indigenous people of the island (the Kanaks) in their struggle against the French occupiers.<br /><br />Michel was dubbed the \\"Red Virgin\\": \\"red\\" because she was an anarchist and \\"virgin\\" because her sexual orientation was unclear (as if this mattered) and because she was unattractive.  I don't see it.  She had a great and beautiful spirit, and I have fallen in love with her.<br /><br />Ocean Press is to be commended for providing a good introduction to the person of Louise Michel and the times that stirred her and she helped to shape.  Through the writings of such notables as Bakunin, Kropotkin, Marx, Engles, Lenin, Emma Goldman, Howard Zinn, the editor's introduction (Nic Maclellan) and Michels herself, we learn about her mixed proletarian and bourgeoisie background, her undying devotion to her mother, her days as a school teacher, her militancy and leadership role during the Paris Commune, her exile in New Caledonia, her return to Paris and her prescient feminism.

In this page-turner, Joan Didion captures the rejection and racism that the Cuban exiles first encountered in Miami when they emigrated from Cuba after Castro assumed power.  She shows how some of the Cubans became successful businesspersons, political powerbrokers, shapers of local culture, renowned humanitarians and philanthropists, expert propagandists, able diplomats, drug runners, muggers, and internationally renowned terrorists.<br /><br />We see the close relationship the Cuban exiles formed with the USA government, especially its clandestine agencies.  We learn that in the 1960s Miami essentially became a CIA recruiting and operational-staging center.  Didion tells us that the CIA had as much as 120,000 \\"regular agents\\" (full and part-time) stationed in south Florida.  It had a flotilla of small boats (often used for terrorist raids on Cuba), making it the third largest navy in the western hemisphere at the time. It owned airline companies in the Miami area and holding companies that lent itself loans for covert operations.  \\"There were [also] hundreds of pieces of Miami real estate, residential bungalows maintained as safe houses, waterfront properties maintained as safe harbors\\" as well as \\"fifty five other front businesses\\" and \\"CIA boat shops,\\" \\"guns shops,\\" real-estate, travel and detective agencies (pp. 90-91).<br /><br />Yet the relationship between the Cuban Americans and the USA has been a troubled one.  Although the Cuban Americans find themselves dependent on the USA for maintaining their struggle against Castro, they also don't trust the government, blaming it for their loss at the Bay of Pigs and for adopting policies soft on Castro.  Likewise, the USA finds some Cuban Americans helpful in its secret foreign adventures (Chile, Nicaragua, Angola, etc.) as well as a nuisance when these terrorist elements assassinate foreign diplomats, blow up airplanes and banks, and murder USA citizens.<br /><br />Particularly poignant is Didion's description of the Cuban Americans' personal and often internecine struggle over understanding themselves as immigrants or exiles.  These struggles have resulted in broken friendships, shunning, public ridicule, financial loss, bodily harm and death.<br /><br />The book only covers Miami until 1987.  I wish Didion would update the book, although it might be dangerous for her to do so.<br /><br />This is a great read and well worth the purchase.irplanes and banks, and murder USA citizens.

Even the President now agrees that Iraq had no WMD based on the Kay report.<br />When one considers all the vilification that Scott Ritter has undergone, how his patriotism and professionalism have been questioned, and how he has even been threatened with Court hearings, simply because he spoke the obvious truth long before it was politically chic to speak it, it is clear that the US government owes Mr. Ritter an immense apology.  It is also obvious that if the United States government wants to conduct a fair and impartial investigation of this intelligence calamity, it should appoint Scott Ritter to head the investigation.	2004-02-11

As justification for the killing, he said &quot;I done my duty.&quot; But this novel is not about the killing per se.  Rather it centers on a young medical student interning at the New York prison where Czolgosz is held awaiting execution. The student, who wants to be an &quot;alienist&quot; (what is now called &quot;psychiatrist&quot;), holds a series of interviews with Czolgosz in order to understand the psychological sources of Czolgosz's act and his anarchistic political philosophy.  Questions arise about Czolgosz's sanity, the influence of Emma Goldman on his life, class struggle and exploitation, as well as the medical student's own values and courage and his capacity to love.<br />The medical student's investigation puts him in the company of anarchists who, to his surprise, debate the political value and morality of Czolgosz's act.  The student even meets Emma Goldman briefly at the end.<br />This book is surprisingly good, especially since it is Coleman's first novel (as far as I can tell).  He even employs the literary style of the era and he has done considerable research.  If you like political fiction, buy this book.  You won't regret it.	2004-01-05

It introduces readers to anarchism in a way that disabuses them of the usual myths about anarchism and anticipates the common fears people have about anarchism.<br />2.  It provides anarchists with quick answers to objections about anarchism (assuming, of course, that anarchists agree with Meltzer's formulations of the answers).<br />Meltzer deftly handles the kinds of criticisms of anarchism made by social democrats, liberal democrats, Marxists, fascists, trade unionists, feminists and capitalists.  He also explores ways people could organize themselves in an anarchistic society.  In my view, the book's sole weakness is its somewhat vague discussion about the transition to an anarchist society. It adequately addresses the core values of all anarchists.<br />The book exceptionally adresses the criticism that individuals would be imperiled in societies that operate without the coercive force of law.  Meltzer rightly argues that individuals would in fact be safer in an anarchist society and that governments actually reduce personal safety by assigning that responsibility to a set of experts (e.g. the police): \\"Unfortunately, having a police force atrophies the ability of society to defend itself.  People [lose] all sense of social organization and control\\" (p. 43).<br />The book contains a helpful, if somewhat limited, list of anarchist organizations at the end.

Chomsky never disappoints.<br />The premise of this work is that economic equality vouchsafes the common good and in fact, historically, democracy is unthinkable without it:<br />&quot;The idea that wealth and democracy can't exist side by side runs right through the Enlightenment and classical liberalism, including major figures like de Tocqueville, Adam Smith, Jefferson and others.  It was more or less assumed&quot;(p. 6).<br />The book then takes up how \\"radical [economic] inequality\\" became the norm and instantiates itself in the USA and elsewhere in the world.  The book also contains interesting discussions about the role of the left and pseudo-left in addressing issues concerning the common good as well as strategies for individuals to promote the common good.<br />A helpful list of organizations that promote the common good appear at the end, making the effect of the entire work both theoretically grounded and practically useful.	2003-12-29

The long awaited re-release of Emma Goldman's My Disillusionment in Russia was well worth the wait.  This is simply a marvelous book.<br />This book continues the tradition of Bakunin (a contemporary of Marx) who argued that Marxism would lead to a state authoritarianism that would be just as exploitive and alienating as bourgeois capitalistic \\"democracies\\" if not more so.  Goldman shows, as she would later argue in her essay \\"There is No Communism in Russia,\\" that Marxist run economies and governments merely supplant the bourgeoisie as employer and coercive authority.  They do not empower workers and communities to run their own affairs along free and cooperative socialistic lines.<br />Like many leftists during her time, Goldman initially supported the communist accession to power as preferable to the Tsarist regime.  But her support was largely based on reports given by communists in the pay of the Bolsheviks.  Goldman was deported from the USA because she spoke publicly against the draft.  Although she probably would have won the case, she decided not appeal the deportation order because she wanted to lend her services to the Russian people and their revoution.  It required little time for her to realize that Bolshevik claims for progress belied the reality in Russia.  Everywhere she saw evidence of mass starvation, extreme censorship, political oppression, cronyism, mass imprisonments and executions, and the tacit contempt the Russian people had for the Bolsheviks.  Her descriptions of Lenin should help to settle oft-repeated lie that Stalin was a Leninist aberration.  He was the natural, if more efficient, successor of Lenin.<br />She deftly refutes the Marxian apologetic that only countries that have experienced extensive capitalistic development are best suited to enter into a revolutionary phase.  If that is so, she asks, then why haven't England, Germany and the USA experienced the social revolution Marx predicted?  She demonstrates that the Bolsheviks were more concerned with power than socialism and replaced the revolution with statism.  The people, not the Bolsheviks, brought about the revolution in Russia, she argues.  The Bolsheviks stole and then murdered it.<br />The narrative style of this work makes it riveting and real.  Readers will get a good sense of the distinction between the libertarian socialism advocated by anarchism and the faux socialism advocated by Marxism.

Although Berkman never abandons his anarchist principles, he does soften his moral repugnance for criminals whose crimes were not motivated by political or humanitarian aims.  If anything his friendships with prisoners deepen his anarchist insights about how exploitation and poverty are the principal causes of criminal behavior.  Like his lover Emma Goldman, he spends his prison years advocating for the needs of his fellow inmates, often being punished for his advocacy.  Berkman details the brutality, graft and corruption of the prison establishment.<br />Anticipating Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, Berkman shows that those who view their punishment as a part of a larger purpose are best equipped to survive the inhuman treatment and conditions of prison life.  The book is not all seriousness, however.  It often has lighter moments, as when Berkman describes the quixotic attempt by his friends to tunnel into the prison to free him.  Berkman's sub rosa argument, made to Goldman, that Leon Czologosz's assassination of President McKinley lacked redeeming social value, unlike his (Berkman's) attempt to assassinate Frick, while though interesting fails to be convincing.  Those interested in the relationship of these remarkable people (Goldman and Berkman) will especially want to read that section.<br />The book is worth reading not merely for its historical value but for its literary qualities as well.  It is intelligently written and difficult to put down.  Although it is 518 pages, I read it all in three days.  It is just that riveting.	2003-12-11

Readers get an accurate sense of their personalities and concerns, a consequence of Zinn's ability to adapt actual source material in the dialogue.<br />The problem with play is that its intention seems to almost entirely consist in introducing readers to Goldman et al.  Although that is a worthy aim, the play itself lacks the dramatic tension necessary to lend cohesion to its snapshots of Goldman's life.  The play seems loosely organized around Berkman's incarceration and Goldman's erotic relationships.  Because these events happened over several years, the play attempts to cover too much time and, consequently, lacks the dramatic intensity of a shortened time frame.<br />Still, for anyone who loves and studies Goldman (as I do), this is a must read.  It's clear that Zinn fully appreciates the greatness of this much-neglected radical.	2003-11-04

I found it difficult to put the book down.<br />I would allow one monopoly to exist: the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" should belong to Franken.  He has earned it in this work.  Franken doesn't go after conservatism per se (in fact he discusses conservatives he likes: e.g. John McCain).  Rather, his target are conservatives who frequently lie or mislead the public.  And he has the goods on them.  No wonder they continue to deride him.<br />What struck me most about Franken is his genuine care for ordinary people.  This makes the book a total feast.

And you might get the impression that the advocacy and political activity of Debbs must be measured almost exclusively by the impact it had on the unions, the socialist party and his intimates.  I had hoped to read more about Debbs' impact beyond these circles.  How did the nation look on Debbs, especially during his presidential campaigns?  What did the other major and minor party candidates make of him?  These questions remain largely unanswered by the books end.<br />At times, the book treats Debbs' presidential campaigns almost in passing.  The campaigns are not treated as events interesting primarily because of the impact they had on the nation.  If the US thought Debbs dangerous enough to incarcerate him during WW1, it is difficult to imagine why a history depicting Debbs' larger political and cultural influence would be difficult to produce.<br />The book describes well how Debbs framed his leftism in an American voice: how he found within the discourse of individualism a foundation for socialism.  But, of course, that direction was all but forgotten after the benighted enthusiasm for the Bolsheviks.	2003-09-29

The trick couldn't be more elementary: if it is liberal, it is bad.  In this work Coulter has varied the trick: &quot;bad&quot; now means &quot;treasonous.&quot;<br />Her amusing and revisionist analysis of Joseph McCarthy is filler.	2003-09-12

The outrage was kept secret from the USA public for a long time.<br />This book provides an excellent introduction to the history and global political dynamics behind the pogroms.  You will be shocked and amazed.	2003-08-12

This book doesn't purport to provide that kind of analysis.<br />But if readers want a book that provides facts on how capitalism effects individuals in the U.S. across a variety of racial, gender and class lines, then it is hard to imagine a better book than this one.  The book is an easy read, but it is by no means simplistic.  It is easy because capitalism isn't nearly as successful at providing a fair and equitable standard of living as is commonly held.  The book proves that point quite well.  Readers might be surprised to discover facts in this book about the U.S. economy that they've never read before.  It's a real eye-opener.	2003-07-19

The book lists a veritable who's who of the exile terrorists (&quot;mercenaries&quot; in the title is an unwarranted kindness by the authors, in my view).<br />It is important for readers to realize, however, that not all exiles support the criminal activities of the few exiles who dream of seizing power in Cuba.<br />The book provides some background on the interviewees, thereby giving the work a good historical perspective.  This book is indispensable to understanding the exile movement and the US government's complicity in its activities.	2003-07-18

It is that extra which abounds in this work.  The definitions provide readers with enough essentials to provide them with a working knowledge of the subject matter and to spur further reading.<br />No work can be entirely devoid of ideology, but I saw nothing particularly &quot;leftist&quot; about this work.  That specter seems to haunt one reviewer below.  However, it is more accurate to say that this dictionary sees no need to repeat the &quot;official&quot; views of neo-liberal democracies about its perceived enemies.  It is as &quot;objective&quot; as a political book can be and as accurate as we expect of a dictionary.<br />This is an excellent tool for those who need explanations of political matters, which includes anyone who studies politics seriously.  I highly recommend it.	2003-06-30
