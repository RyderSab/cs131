Our grade school children like to discuss science facts at bedtime. Reading from this book opens up lots of topics for us and keeps the kids fascinated. I'm thinking of ordering more to use as gifts since the Amazon price is so reasonable and the shipping is free.	2004-05-25

This book is way below average - definately NOT a keeper. I've enjoyed many of Ms. Medeiro's books but this one is so poorly written that I could barely finish it. Hayden St. Clair is supposed to be a lonely, brooding, dark character but the book is so flip that it destroys any intensity he might generate. As a result, the chemistry between Hayden and Carlotta doesn't work and the plot just doesn't make sense. At one point - when Carlotta feels she's betrayed Hayden - she flees to London for four months! Why? Then she supposedly redeems herself by publishing a sordid novel about their life story - one that puts her in a bad light. However, we're never told exactly what she has written about herself. What a disappointment!	2003-11-18

I've read a lot of romances and this novel is different than the typical fare. For one thing it has a more modern, \\"men are from mars, women from venus\\" perspective and explores the fundamental ways that men and women differ in their perceptions of the same experience. It's also surprisingly frank in addressing Phillip's 8-year-long celebacy. I thought the pacing of the romance was more true to real-life. It doesn't happen in a love at first sight dramatic way but through a series of emotional and physical intimacies. <br />The only reason I subtracted a star from my review is that I found the narration too flip, too often in some parts. I was especially annoyed by the overbearing brothers and would have preferred a much smaller dose of them.<br />Nevertheless, I loved this book and Julia Quinn is still a favorite of mine.	2003-08-19

Luke is one of the weakest and slowest heros in a romance novel. He almost seemed mentally retarded. It's not just our hero who is slow, however, but the entire pace of the plot. And there is extremely little sexual tension or action.  Still, the bridal veil was a short and pleasant read.	2003-04-06

Margaret, at the very old romance novel age of 35, is a poor, struggling spinster shocked by the handsome and frozen man who falls into her doorway during a winter storm. The book has a nice rhythm.

Mary Marsh, the Longfellow family's seamstress, agrees to help discover the secrets behind Marcus Longfellow's sister's death. Every movement, every thought, every glance, every twitch sizzles with inexplicable tension between Mary and Marcus until I wanted to pull out the pages in the book with annoyance. Each minute action is subjected to prolonged scrutiny and introspection. And the whole story, at least the part which I read, unfolds in a creepy, decidedly unromantic way.	2002-12-28

The main characters express their love long before the end of the story and there is an excess of lovemaking which reduces the tension between the characters. The hero, Robert, struggles between honor and heart, taking an awfully long time to make the right choice.	2002-04-22

I found the hero to be a nasty, violent misogynist. The hero actually kidnaps the heroine, locks her in a room and forces her to eat. Yuck.

The hero is pretty revolting in the beginning and I almost didn't keep reading because I was so put off. Also, the pacing is a little bit off in this book and the ending kind of dribbles to a close. Also, a few details were left unresolved - what of the poor, grief-crazed grandfather?
