This year, there are five winged dragon pictures, with seven non-dragon &quot;Mystics&quot; pictures.<br />The calendar page (date section) lists the usual US, UK, NZ, Canadian, and Australian holidays and Days of Importance. Phases of the moon are listed, as are the previous/coming month in the lower corner (the previous/coming months being something left out of far too many calendars these days). Each calendar page features a grayscale sketch in the background, and the day squares are large enough to make legible notes.<br />The calendar is on thick, glossy paper. This year's (2003) pictures, by name, are: Crown of Shadows, The End of Nature I, Goldwing, The Reach, Dragonsbane, Hope, Mountain of Black Glass, Dragon Prince, Arkady, Stronghold, The Narrow Way, Amazing Dragon. High quality, beautiful colors, crisp and clear images, very frame-worthy.<br />My personal favorite this year is the stunning &quot;Crown of Shadows,&quot; a black-clad male figure holding aloft a black sword. The figure's eyes are glowing, and there is a faint female form behind him, underneath the erupting volcano. Also worth mentioning are &quot;The Reach,&quot; a young female hanging from a heavy chain (grasping the chain, not chained to) and reaching down for something. Behind her seems to be the dilapidated inside of a tower (this was the cover for Zettel's sci-fi book &quot;Kingdom of Cages.&quot;) &quot;Arkady&quot; features a young woman standing in the forefront, with a twisting arch far behind her. The blue shades in this picture are amazing. &quot;The End of Nature&quot; is a woman walking along flat treetops, with no ground in sight.<br />A calendar is something that hangs on your wall for a year, and is something you glance at every day. Why not have something beautiful and distracting?<br />Highly recommended.	2003-01-09
US	50364769	R3H3OIKTZO536O	0786710330	155947080	Time Machines: The Best Time Travel Stories Ever Written	Books	4	27	28	N	N	Good, eclectic, fun collection of time travel tales	This is what a theme-based anthology should be! The title is slightly misleading since not all of the tales involve time &quot;machines&quot; although all are tales of traveling through time in one way or another.<br />Some fine authors are represented in the 22 stories here: Edgar Allen Poe and Rudyard Kipling, John W. Campbell and Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Rod Serling, Connie Willis and Larry Niven, Jack Finney and Anthony Boucher. And more. When Adler picked these tales, he chose well. Earliest story is from 1850 (Poe), most recent from 1997.<br />There are tales of people visiting the dinosaur era, all sorts of people visiting Important Historical Events, a hilarious tale of an agent from the Marriage Prevention Bureau (they send people back to interfere with what would end up being bad marriages), a strange story about a test pilot ending up in the extreme far future, a story based on the &quot;What if I had...&quot; daydreams people tend to have, another strange tale about finding ways around &quot;can't change the past,&quot; a story about time travelers who set out to find &quot;missing&quot; aliens they know MUST be somewhere, or somewhen.<br />My favorites: Jack Finney's charming classic &quot;The Third Level&quot; about a man taking a &quot;wrong&quot; turn in New York's Grand Central Station and ending up in the past, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Odyssey of Flight 33&quot; where a commercial airliner finds itself going into the past, even as far back as the dinosaur eras, and a charming buddy-story about two very intelligent, capable college professors who go back in time simply to drink, chat and be merry with historical figures. There is a (what should be frightening) tale about a three year old girl who figures out time travel and uses time travel for her hide-and-seek games.<br />My beef: Ray Bradbury is indeed in this anthology with &quot;A Touch of Petulance,&quot; when I had expected &quot;A Sound of Thunder,&quot; considered a classic of classics. Still nice to see a Bradbury tale, even if his characters didn't step on that butterfly.<br />Sources/bibliography are included, so the reader will know when and where the stories came from. That's something I expect, and appreciate, when an anthology provides them. Not just in the pre-index but at the beginning of each story when possible. Adler's paragraph size comments (at the beginning of each story) were nice as well.<br />Recommended for people who like time travel stories. These are fantasy-type science fiction stories where the people have fun moving about through time.<br />Highly recommended for fans of time travel stories. These stories are &quot;fun&quot; tales without much of the high-tech technobabble about physical realities and limitations.	2003-01-09
US	50364769	R1GCHM3348ONUZ	0670815683	250120557	Shaker Lane	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Bittersweet & Poignant, not a young child's book	This book tells a sad tale of \\"progress and civilization\\" overtaking a peaceful rural town.<br />The town originally began when two widows started selling plots of their vast land a half acre or so at a time, when they became unable to tend the fields themselves. The ladies \\"sold them cheap.\\" Slowly but surely, the town grew bit by bit, with kindly rural folk moving in. Eventually, a smell rural town developed.<br />The people, most with little education, lived simply, and tended to strew their property about their yards: old iceboxes, wheel-less cars, assorted broken down farm vehicles. Soon the surrounding folks began to heckle the place. Still, the people of Shaker Lane were good, honest, decent folk. Multi-generation families lived there. They helped out anyone who needed it, and looked after one another. Everybody knew everybody. It was a peaceful place to live.<br />Inevitably, the Powers That Be decide to build a dam on the nearby pond, which will flood Shaker Lane. The people will have to move. One by one, they go. Sadly.<br />Once the dam is built, and the lands adapt, the new building begins. Concrete, stucco, and asphalt in place of wood and metal. Brand new modern homes, with manicured yards, backyard patios, basketball courts, and built-in swimming pools. \\"Single family homes\\" without the grandparents, cousins, uncles, etc the previous residents had. Lots of loud, new, fancy automobiles. Progress.<br />What had been an idyllic, peaceful town full of kindly neighbors who helped one other is now a \\"modern\\" semi-suburb lived in by an entirely different sort of people. The old (and elderly) residents have given way to the young. Seeing it now, \\"You wouldn't know the place,\\" we are told.<br />**<BR>A well-told story, not for younger children, even though it looks like a children's picture book. The story is quite sad, poignant because of the harsh reality of these situations, as they have been happening as \\"suburbs\\" creep farther out and out. Progress.<br />The illustrations are beautifully rendered in a soft way. The book is hard to classify, although recommended.	2003-01-09
US	50364769	R2DTHW0RM5OV9U	1567311563	216075573	A Century of Fantasy, 1980-1989	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Not one of Silverberg's better selections	This book is a collection of eighteen fantasy stories, from some very distinguished and well known authors. Unfortunately for me these stories have already been covered in almost every other fantasy anthology book available.<br />Still, there are some noteworthy tales here. While there are a few fantasy-fantasy stories (knights and dragons and minor magic) most of the stories are contemporary tales that, not fitting into the general \\"fiction\\" category, ended up as \\"fantasy.\\" Many times such tales get classified under the \\"science fiction\\" category. Many in fact I do recognize from \\"Analog\\", \\"Science Fiction and Fantasy\\", and \\"Asimov's\\" magazines.<br />Included tales that struck my fancy are \\"The Edge of the World\\" (Michael Stanwick), about three bored contemporary teens who decide to descend the abyss at the edge of town. Good sense of wonder in this one (it really does seem to be the Edge of the World since there is an endless stairway that winds its way down, and down, and down endlessly), and the protagonists are real and believable with lots of angst, and confusion about life (and not the Edge itself). \\"Wong's Lost and Found Emporium\\" (William Wu) is about a strange shop where you can find things that you have lost; and not just that charm bracelet you lost at the beach but perhaps lost hopes and dreams as well. Not as cliche as it sounds.<br />The authors participating are (last name only for space): Zelazny, Haldeman, de Lint, Bishop, Martin, Kushner, Foster, Silverberg, Tiptree, Wu, Ellison, Bear, Springer, Le Guin, Norton, Stanwick, Card, Niven.<br />A Minus: the publishing rights/agency credits are given, but not the sources/bibliography. Each story here came from somewhere else; Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Asimov's, Locus, Interzone, etc. Not a mention of any resource. Some of us like to know this stuff.<br />It's clear that the publishers of this book elected Silverberg to cough up a fantasy anthology, and he wasn't quite up to the task. Usually he makes better selections when he edits such a book. In fairness I will say that most of the stories here have won, or have been nominated for, the various yearly awards (World Fantasy, Hugo, Nebula, etc.)<br />If you have three or more contemporary fantasy anthologies, chances are you already have all of the stories in this book. If you do not, and are looking for sword and sorcery, this book isn't it. If you are looking for \\"contemporary\\" style fantasy, this may suit your taste.	2003-01-09

The main theme is the dragon (the winged, clawed European variety) with five non-dragon pictures.<br />The calendar page (date section) lists the usual US, UK, NZ, Canadian, and Australian holidays and days of importance. Phases of the moon are included, as are the previous/coming month (something far too many calendars exclude these days). The calendar page also features a grayscale sketch in the background. The day squares are large, plenty of room for scribbling notes.<br />The calendar is on thick, glossy paper. The pictures, by name, are: Dragon Lake, Snow Queen, Weyrworld, Erosion, Prudence 2, Dragon Flight, Dragonsdawn, Verge, Shonto's Garden, White Dragon, Renegades of Pern, Dragon Lord. The size and quality makes every plate frameworthy.<br />My personal favorites in the calendar are the striking &quot;Snow Queen&quot; (a woman wearing an elaborate mask, main colors are white against astonishing blues) and &quot;Erosion,&quot; an almost indescribable image of a lone figure on a precipice looking up at a streetlight with stormclouds in the distance. &quot;Erosion&quot; has amazing colors, and draws the viewer's eyes to the blazing horizon behind the figure.<br />A very distracting calendar. Recommended.	2002-01-11
US	50364769	R7DN5C1943IWM	0441008321	860060848	Chronospace	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Somewhat predictable yet very enjoyable	The foundation of the story is very simple: time-traveling historians and their surly &quot;timeship&quot; pilot go to 1937 to witness the Hindenberg zeppelin disaster. Except, of course, the Hindenberg lands without any problems, and all of the passengers and crew safely disembark in Lakehurst, New Jersey. So what went wrong? Did one or all of them do something to cause a paradox?<br />In the &quot;present&quot; of 1998, there is a government scientist, Murphy, who innocently writes an article for a popular science fiction magazine. He suggests that perhaps UFOs are NOT extraterrestrial spies in their spaceships at all, but merely time travelers in their time machines. While this is blasphemy to many hardcore UFO buffs, the article still manages to attract some unwelcome and unexpected attention for poor Murphy.<br />Intersperse some non-UFO &quot;angel&quot; sightings, an X-Files type government agency, secret aircraft testing at Area 51, hardcore skeptics, an anti-Nazi German Resistance movement, plausible science, New Age crystal-meditating Whitley Strieber adherents, no-nonsense military generals and budget-conscious bureaucrats.<br />The story arcs come together beautifully, and although parts of the book are rather predictable time-travel fare, the book manages to remain a page-turner. Allen Steele artfully creates situations and locations that are familiar and believable, only to slowly reveal that some of these events are happening in a parallel timeline, an alternate wordline.<br />Unfortunately, I too must point out that the editing is poor and there are quite a few typographical errors and missing words. Some of these mistakes occur at some relevant points in the story and almost entirely change the gist of things; missing words during some important dialog, typographical errors regarding among other things, dates. Shame, shame.<br />Perhaps Allen M. Steele is testing the waters a bit here with this novel. While an outright sequel may require some deft maneuvering, I'm hopeful the orbiting space lab, &quot;Chronos Station&quot; and the characters in it may be reappearing in future books by this talented author.<br />Fun and lighthearted time-travel science fiction fare.	2001-09-15
US	50364769	R1FV7MAQWQBHYY	0751521353	780243835	Vivia	Books	3	41	43	N	N	Dark, mesmerizing, incomplete	A haunting tale told in a calm, hypnotic voice.<br />The story is of the darkly beautiful Vivia, daughter of a feared and powerful warlord. A strange and deadly plague decimates the survivors of a bloody war, and Vivia, seeking to escape death, hides in the secret grotto deep under her father's castle. There, in the silent darkness, a presence seduces her and changes her, ensuring that Vivia's striking beauty and youth be a part of her forever. (I hesitate to say &quot;vampire,&quot; since this was a somewhat nontraditional vampire story.)<br />Left alone to discover her powers on her own, Vivia hides again, and this time is found by the warrior prince, Zulgaris. An alchemist as well, Zulgaris is first drawn to Vivia's beauty but soon realizes that she harbors powers that he himself wants to make use of. <br />Vivia, for all of her experiences and abilities, mutely accepts everything that is done to her. Still unsure of exactly what her powers consist of (although she knows she has magic), she allows herself to be mistreated and experimented upon. The death she so feared during the plague is the death that now will never touch her. She can escape death, but not the cruelties of life. She must learn to take control of her own destiny.<br />*<br />Definitely not a tale for the timid. There is a lot of violence, and rape occurs throughout the novel. The language in some parts contains more vulgarity than is probably necessary. Tanith Lee's voice is ethereal and tells Vivia's story vividly. Tanith Lee impressively brings forth Vivia, who is detached from life and indifferent to life, although she scorns death. Vivia is not a likable character; she is cold, cruel, aloof, silent, and while not &quot;weak,&quot; she meekly allows people to mistreat her. It was hard to accept that a person with such raw magical power (or anyone, for that matter) would simply allow herself to be so abused, and abused she is. Vivia the character, despite all that happens to her, elicits no sympathy. It's the haunting way that this story is told that redeems the book. The ending is vague and leaves room for a sequel.<br />For those who are Tanith Lee fans, and for those who like violent dark fantasy.	2001-07-29

Once there, Ce'Nedra's true mission comes forth: she wants Polgara, the immortal sorceress, to &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; of Belgarath's autobiography and write her own story. Of course Polgara dismisses this idea as childish, until Polgara's mother, the divinely wise Poledra (undoubtedly THE most powerful and respected person ever) simply orders her to do it. Reluctantly but obediently Polgara pens her tale...<br />Born and raised in the Vale of Aldur, Polgara and her twin sister Beldaran were raised by the other sorcerers, since the twins' parents were not there. Polgara was the dark one, quiet and brooding. Beldaran was the light one, sunny in appearance and disposition. Polgara went through a misfit teen stage and lived in a tree for years while bright and happy Beldaran lived in a quartz castle surrounded by love and affection. Soon though, Beldaran, who is mortal, was betrothed to a prince destined to become a powerful king. Polgara, accepting responsibility, cleans up her act and begins the long trip to immortal supremacy. Along the way she learns to harness her godlike magical powers, falls in love with an Arend and gains the title of &quot;Duchess of Erat,&quot; is briefly &quot;owned&quot; by a wealthy Nadrak merchant, loses loved ones in wars, pines for her sister, oversees a long line of nephews, and of course, gets exasperated with her father, Belgarath.<br />Polgara, who came across as cold, scheming, strict, and &quot;waspish&quot; in the Belgariad/Mallorean, here is quite different. She seems warmer, more compassionate, more approachable, more tolerant of people, a bit silly, and still quite serious about what she obviously considers to be the most important virtue, Sobriety.  Not quite the same Polgara fromthe First Ten books. This one is more &quot;girlish&quot; in a giggly sort of way. Polgara the Woman of PtS seemed more realistic than the icily calculating Polgara the All-Powerful Sorceress of Belgariad/Mallorean. Two similar but different Polgaras, and I'm not sure which one I liked better.<br />Belgarath is even more of a bumbling dunderhead here in PtS than he was even in &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer,&quot; yet Polgara's exasperation and unwavering love for him is still evident. Poledra, who was born a wolf, lacked any real warmth yet remained acceptable in her &quot;wolfishness.&quot;<br />A very poignant part of Polgara's story is her deep and genuine love for the charming Ontrose, a Wacite Arend nobleman. This was very moving, and a bittersweet memory that Polgara had cherished for countless centuries. A disappointing aspect of PtS was the briefness of Polgara's tale of her stay with a Nadrak. This was mentioned briefly in Belgariad/Mallorean, &quot;the time when Polgara was owned by a Nadrak.&quot; Now, talk about intriguing! Polgara being led around on a leash and SOLD (although for a goodly amount of gold) to Belgarath? I wanted more; the Nadraks are one of the more interesting tribes of Eddings' world, and while being &quot;owned&quot; is nothing like slavery, it was an interesting position for Polgara to be in. I was looking forward to it and was quite disappointed that the entire ordeal was covered in only a few pages.<br />The Eddingses should be commended for making the voice of Polgara different from the voice of Belgarath. I'm not saying that Polgara's book was &quot;feminine&quot; or that Belgarath's story was &quot;masculine,&quot; just that the two books had two different (although sometimes similar) souls. While not as joyous in temperament as &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer,&quot; PtS was still an enjoyable read. Now if only the Eddingses would grace us with the tale of Beldin!<br />Recommended for Eddings fans, and for fans of general Fantasy.	2001-07-12

It seems that when the author came up with the idea of writing this book, he made a list of &quot;religious&quot; words (from &quot;abbey&quot; to &quot;Zion&quot;) and then quickly made up definitions for them (most of them during Mass, he claims). None of them made me laugh, although a few made me chuckle. Includes cartoony illustrations.<br />A few examples:<br />Apostasy:  The difficult process of giving up one set of beliefs in favor of another - such as converting to the metric system.<br />Canon Law:  The principle that whoever has the canon makes the law.<br />Devil:  Evil with a capital D.<br />Evil:  Four-fifths of the Devil.<br />Free Will:  A gift from God that you will pay for later if you use it incorrectly.<br />Incense: Holy smoke.<br />Lot: How much salt there is in a pillar.<br />Martyr:  A religious person who gets stoned.<br />Mount of Olives:  A hill located near the Straight of Vermouth.<br />Papal Bull:  A letter from the Pope that is in-falli-bull.<br />Satan:  An angel who got fired.<br />Wine:  The grapes of Mass.<br />Not a serious book, it will still make a cute gift for your Catholic friend going though First Communion or Confirmation.	2001-07-12

He, accompanied by his oddball wife, goes to London for medical treatment.<br />In the hospital, the mellow Spindrift meets a whole assortment of people: unique patients, arrogant insensitive physicians, cold uncaring nurses, rude orderlies, distant medical technicians, and the people who love them. Confused, bored, and exasperated with painful medical tests, Spindrift &quot;escapes&quot; the brain ward to disappear into nighttime London.<br />Misty and cold &quot;civilized&quot; London is very alien to the doctor, who has grown accustomed to sunny tropical Burma. Fascinated and horrified at the same time, Spindrift wanders the dark recesses of a Modern Western City in search of... something. Or maybe he's just running.<br />Spindrift runs into some very strange and utterly believable people. He finds himself in unusual, bizarre situations, every one of them genuine and real. More at home with language and words than with people, Spindrift is nevertheless spellbound by the alien Londoners with their colorful speech and habits.<br />After numerous adventures (or misadventures), he finds himself back in the stark, bright, antiseptic hospital. The hospital being so very alien in its own way, Edwin Spindrift PhD wonders just how many of those bizarre memories were real... in retrospect, things seem so amazing.<br />The story is a bit dated yet enough has remained the same (proof that some things may never change) that Spindrift's wild trip is still understandable and imaginable. It's a story of perceptions, or false perceptions. TDIS was one of those rare books that I had to set down sometimes to THINK about what I had just read. I hadn't done that with a book in a long time. I enjoyed not only reading this book, but thinking about it, too.<br />A very sly tale. Highly recommended.only reading this book, but thinking about it, too.<br />A very sly tale. Highly recommended.	2001-07-12

There is a wonderful two-page Foreword by Ray Bradbury.<br />This book is divided into two sections. The first section, &quot;Doorways to the Future,&quot; which has lengthy and informative narrative, focuses on the history of Sci-Fi art. Beginning with woodcuts, early mechanical drawings, and illustrations for the works of Jules Verne, this section gently leads the reader though the many stages of evolution of fantastic art. There are quite a few black and white drawings from such artists as Henri de Montaut, Joseph Clement Coll, Virgil Finlay, and Leo Summers (a colorblind artist who created some fine, detailed sketches). Also included are some examples from early &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; comics.<br />The second section, &quot;Masters of the Infinite,&quot; showcases artists in alphabetical order, starting with Paul Alexander and ending with Stephen Youll. Of course some popular artists are left out, but the samples of those who are included do give ample credit to those named (although some of the selections are not always among the artists' &quot;best&quot;). There are a few borderline Sci-Fi/Fantasy works in this book, from Frank Frazetta, Manual Sanjulian, and Boris Vallejo, though most of the art is focused on Science Fiction art.<br />The art in this book includes book covers, magazine covers, illustrations for stories, and commissioned/noncommissioned art. The colors are sharp and clear, edges are crisp and clean. There are many full-page pictures, even a few two-pagers. No pictures are &quot;too small.&quot;<br />While a great book, I'm taking one-and-a-half stars off for the bad editing. Quite a few of the works are identified incorrectly (mislabeled), really they are just transposed in most cases. Still, someone should have caught these errors before the book was printed.<br />Recommended for Sci-Fi buffs.<br />Three-and-a-half stars, rounded up.	2001-05-06

Barely.<br />Richard Cypher, a young mellowish woodsman, lives in Westland, which is a world without magic. He has a brother, Michael, who is pretty much an arrogant buffoon with lofty political aspirations. Michael of course lives in a fancy manse in a fancy residential area, whereas Richard lives in a humble cabin in the woods. Richard's two best friends are Zedd, an older, eccentric man, and Chase, a &quot;boundary warden&quot; (a ranger-warrior who patrols the borderlands).<br />One day, while strolling though the woods, Richard rescues a strange woman from a small group of equally strange pursuers, dispatching the pursuers with the help of the woman. Although obviously trained in the use of arms, Richard isn't exactly a seasoned warrior, so the incident puts him in a dark mood.<br />Much of the base tale is predictable and follows a very standard fantasy mold: a character who is not what he originally claimed to be, a character who is not what he thought he is, a highborn character pursued by sinister agents, a search for a necessary magical item, dangerous fantastic creatures who recognize a hero on sight (and offer help when needed), dangerous semi-intelligent creatures who kill first and belch later, a betrayal, a man-child growing into an adult through circumstance, and of course.... a magic sword.<br />While most of the happenings were predictable, there were some surprising aspects in WFR. The Bad Guys are all sadistic wackos, one of them being a demented pedophile, liking very young boys. This isn't handled in a subtle manner, in fact very little is subtle in this book. Half the book is sure to shock the timid. There is an obscene segment in WFR in which Richard is captured and brutally &quot;trained&quot; by a professional torturer/dominatrix who is a kind of magical vampire. This &quot;training&quot; is lengthy and graphically detailed, and included esoteric apparatus, exotic fetishes, gory ultraviolence, and assorted kinkiness.<br />An interesting quirk of Richard's that we, the readers, can appreciate is that he is as clueless of the magical lands of Midlands and D'Hara as we are. At first, we don't know what a &quot;gar&quot; is, either. All we know is what's obvious: it's big, it's mean, it's ugly, it's hungry, it can crush boulders in its fists, and it smells bad. We the readers, along with Richard, find out what the assorted magical creatures are. When Richard is lost and separated, so are we. Yet there were times I wished whatever creature was lurking in the shadows would just eat everyone. The characters failed to elicit my sympathy, and with the exception of Richard (sometimes) and a child character, I didn't really care if the companions succeeded or not.<br />Although WFR is the first book of six so far, it did a fairly good job of wrapping up a story arc. Since I started this &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series to help fill in my reading time while I wait for Martin to grace us with the next installment of his &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, I can appreciate a doorstopper that does end in a maddening cliffhanger. Still, while I have book two, &quot;Stone of Tears&quot; on hand, I'm not in any hurry to read it. <br />Although I can see the potential for a grand epic here, I'll say again that this book just barely kept me interested. I put the book down several times and wandered off to see which of my books needed re-reading. Then I came back to WFR, only to wander off again.	2001-05-01

Meanwhile the pre-Hubble, Pre-Apollo, pre-Sputnik artists are receding into the mists as more new artists appear (along with their snazzy up to date computers and expensive software).<br />VoS is a tribute to these original masters: the dreamers who imagined the rings of Saturn at sunset as viewed from one of its moons, the optimists who KNEW their grandchildren would live in domed habitats on the Moon, the artists who drew Von Braun wheels in orbit around the planets (with the firm belief that mankind would have reached this far by no later than the end of the twentieth century), the adventureminded who saw in their mind's eye the churning clouds of Jupiter seen from a mining colony on a Galilean moon.<br />Likely to be unimpressive to many younger people weaned on &quot;Star Wars,&quot; the newer &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, and video games, this book can be appreciated by the folks who imagined what Mars looked like before the Viking landings proved or disproved our imaginations. Before Hubble, Pioneer, Voyager, Venera. These were the days of rockets and rocketmen, before contemporary science fiction made &quot;hyperdrive&quot; and &quot;planetary federation&quot; household words.<br />When looking at the art in VoS, it is necessary to remember that much of the work represented here was made before the modern advances and discoveries of modern astronomy. Chesley Bonestell, one of the true grandmasters of space art, created visions of space based on imagination alone... he saw in his mind's eye the shadows cast by the rings of Saturn, rocketmen in heavy armorlike spacesuits as they mined yet-to-be discovered heavy elements on a distant asteroid, he saw a bright future of colonized space.<br />There are some contemporary artists featured in VoS; Pamela Lee, Michael Carroll, Don Dixon, Ed Tucciarone, Kim Poor, David A. Hardy et al. Some artists have enjoyed careers that span decades, and continue to flourish today. There are those who had work commissioned early in the 20th century: Scriven Bolton, Howard Russell Butler, H. Seppings Wright, Lucien Rudaux, Abbe Th. Moreux, James Nasmyth. These people deserve much credit for getting the space program started, and for giving the Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials something to base their scenery on.<br />There are many two-page pictures in this book, and almost all are in color, very few are in B&amp;W (some of the obscure color paintings were photographed in B&amp;W for books in the first quarter of the 20th century).<br />The foreword is by Arthur C.

Not a novel to take seriously, just a fun read.<br />A group of twentysomething historians are in France, excavating the &quot;forgotten&quot; medieval castle (ruins) of one of the minor lords. They are funded by a young, brash, Bill Gates type of billionaire entrepreneur. The entrepreneur, Doniger, calls a meeting with one of the academics, and soon this academic is missing. Before his companions get too worried, though, they find something very odd in a stack of old parchment: a plea for help from their missing professor. Dating back to the 1350s.<br />It turns out that Doniger's current company has worked out a form of time travel. The missing professor is indeed lost somewhere in the 1350s. Doniger enlists the help of four of the historians to find the lost professor and if he is still alive, to bring him back to 1999.<br />The companions, along with escorts from Doniger's company, after some preparations, go back in time to 1357 to look for their friend. And the adventure begins!<br />They do all sorts of medieval things: they joust in a tournament, get into swordfights, get tossed in the dungeon, get chased by knights, help a damsel in distress. They eat, drink, and get merry. While they do get injured, no one gets sick, which seems odd and yet is never explained. Perhaps we weren't supposed to notice.<br />Finding the missing professor is one thing, rescuing him and getting everyone together by the appointed time is another. They have assorted, colorful adventures with outlandish characters: a vixenish scheming widowed noblewoman, a brutish and twisted warlord, insane knights, studious monks. A strange and alien world, yet still closer to our hearts because this is not another planet, this is OUR planet, just in the past.<br />Quite a rollicking enterprise. The 1350s are vividly described, and there is a helpful bibliography included. Although the characterization is rather weak, and some of the actions of the characters are questionable, the story held together. <br />This is pure entertainment, and in my opinion, not the kind of book that gets discussed in depth, since there isn't anything to debate. It's just fun.<br />Three-and-a-half stars, rounded down	2001-05-01
US	50364769	R11QIDJ4WHRCAX	1888054298	99160393	Science Fiction of the 20th Century : An Illustrated History	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Breathtaking	This book is a beautiful collection of some stunning science fiction art.<br />Two things should be mentioned right away: first, that this is a book of science fiction art, not fantasy (there are no dragons, no unicorns, no elves), and second, that with the exception of a few science fiction movie posters, the art featured within are book covers and magazine covers.<br />This book itself is a work of art. It's large, it's heavy (printed on thick glossy paper), it's very colorful and has very fancy graphic designs. The layout is easy to see, eye-catching, and well spaced. Some of the featured covers are full-page. Most pages have two or three covers, a few have four. In other words, the pictures are never crowded together, and remain large enough to show detail.<br />Many of the covers are astounding. There are assorted rockets, saucers, aeroplanes, even a few flying globes. There are furry aliens, tentacled aliens, winged aliens, reptilian aliens, aquatic aliens, some tiny humanoid aliens. Heroes in skintight clothing, heroes in coverall jumpsuits, heroes in metallic spacemechs, heroes in Roman Centurion gear (go figure), heroes in clanky armorlike spacesuits. The women, especially in the earlier pulps and books, tend to be either scantily clad or in skintight clothing, and most are in various states of distress (being carried off by aliens). There are vistas of deserts, oceans, mountain ranges, desolate moonscapes, fantastic alien forests, fabulous spaceports. Many moons hang in the sky, and fantastic ringed planets.<br />Among the magazines included are Analog, Asimov's, Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction, Argosy, Astounding, Amazing Stories, Planet Stories, Science Wonder Stories, Locus. And more. Book covers range from forgotten novellas to bestselling classics. Movie posters from B-movie creature features to contemporary blockbusters. There really is a lot of art in this book.<br />The narrative, which is actually extensive, mostly follows the history of the sci-fimagazines and their circulation. The data is informative, but when the art is this beautiful, you won't be reading the small print except to see who did the drawing anyway. You'll lose yourself in this book!<br />There is only one reason I took one star from the review: some of the art is not identified. The publishers really ought to be ashamed of themselves for overlooking this, in an art book of all things. The entries are identified (although some of the artists' names have been lost, the publisher or sources are named), but the graphics of the cover (of this book) and the chapter introductions are not identified. Shame, shame! The chapter introduction plates are breathtaking, as are the inside-cover and dustjacket art.<br />This is a book of dreams and imagination. Normally I'd call this a &quot;coffee table book&quot; but not this time. HIDE this book and hoard it for yourself. It's a treasure.	2001-05-01
US	50364769	R2UQAYEHSSFV3D	078944951X	386936980	100 Best Album Covers	Books	3	30	33	N	N	Hastily thrown together	At least half of the featured album covers were familiar to me, and the book did contain interesting and informative snippets of information. However I was a bit dismayed that some album covers were overlooked, memorable covers by such popular bands as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Meatloaf, ELO, Boston, Blue Oyster Cult, and Iron Maiden (for their frightening Eddie character that graced so many of their albums).<br />As an art book, this book is a joke. I have many coffee-table and art books, and &quot;100 Best Album Covers&quot; is the only one I have that centers some featured graphics in the CENTER of the book. By that, I mean that a picture is centered in a two page spread, which runs the spine of the book right down the middle of the picture. All of the other art books I have put a graphic on one page so that you can see it (unless it's oversized). The pictures here aren't oversized and would easily fit on one page. It's hard to appreciate even a nifty album cover when you can only see the outer edges of it clearly. Far too many of the album covers are centered on the spine this way. The emphasis in this book is on the commentary it seems, and not so much the picture. Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer's &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; (an impressive work by the famous artist Giger) isn't quite as breathtaking when you have to pry and bend the book open and crack the spine to see it. <br />The publishers should revise this book and reissue it.	2001-03-26
US	50364769	R1EH91B2ZNWSBE	0553074474	907177362	The Art of Michael Whelan	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Breathtaking art, beautiful format	This book is truly a work of art!<br />The eminently talented Michael Whelan showcases his treasures in this large-size, full-color coffee table book.<br />With his superb attention to detail and boundless imagination, MW has created fantastic worlds. Here, he catalogues his numerous book covers (all genres of Science Fiction, and all genres of Fantasy, and other areas), paintings, and assorted works (he paints not just for a living but for his own enjoyment, evident in the many small sketches included throughout the book). <br />MW himself describes each piece. He isn't an artist who simply creates a cover when commissioned; he reads the text of the book he will be making a cover for. This is what makes his book cover art so wonderful. In my mind, his cover art for &quot;Catspaw&quot; and &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; are every bit as memorable as the stories they were made for. He details everything minutely: the curling edges of a drying leaf, the dust stain in a fold of clothing, a nick on the blade of a warrior's battle-ax, a snarl in a lock of hair, the markings on a spaceship lifting off from a background launch pad, the clearing sky reflected in a dangling pane of broken glass, the frayed edges of a worn rope attached to a forgotten bell. And that's just the little stuff in the background.<br />What sets this book aside from other art books is the fact that this book is made for people who like to LOOK at the art. Nearly half of the pieces featured here are full-page size, with the text/description and sketches, studies, details, alternative concepts on the facing page. Too many art books tend to squeeze pictures into small squares on a page. None of that here. The colors are sharp and vivid. The edges are sharp and crisp. The paper used is heavy glossy paper. There are three chapters (interviews, introduction, technical aspects) printed on heavy parchment-like paper. The book itself is clothbound in matte midnight black, embossed in gold. The publishers sparedno expense in making this book. <br />And here's something I haven't seen in other art books: the 85+ full page plates are indexed in a back section of the book. Shrunk down to B&amp;W postage-stamp size, you can glance through to quickly find your favorite picture.<br />The work represented here covers everything from dragons, winged lions, medieval castles, futuristic alien castles, strange aliens, bustling spaceports, nature settings, warriors of every type, humans and much more. Each picture is worth a thousand words indeed.<br />The paper cover/dustjacket features &quot;Passage: The Avatar&quot; (the breathtaking blue ruins) on the front and &quot;The Summer Queen&quot; on the back, both are featured inside the book. This is a plus, as many times the dustjacket art is counted among the represented work.<br />Very highly recommended.	2001-03-24
US	50364769	R37YPWFYOBVQXD	0345403959	388609856	Belgarath the Sorcerer (The Belgariad & The Malloreon)	Books	4	11	16	N	N	Entertaining though discontinous	Read this only after you've read the Belgariad/Mallorean series and don't mind getting a different view of the character of Belgarath.<br />BtS begins where &quot;Seeress of Kell&quot; left off: in the Vale of Aldur, where the family has gathered to witness the births of Polgara's and Durnik's twins. Soon after, the topic of Belgarath's true past comes up, and Belgarion, Durnik, Ce'Nedra and Polgara begin to bully Belgarath about writing his memoirs. Belgarath remains obstinate until his wife Poledra suggests that memoirs would be a fine idea indeed. Having no choice anymore, Belgarath unhappily hunkers down to tell the story of his life.<br />In the days when the gods walked the earth, he was born in the ancient pastoral village of Gara and orphaned young, gaining himself the name of Garath, &quot;of the town of Gara.&quot; Here he learned to steal, lie, and cheat in order to survive. In his own words, &quot;Larceny seethed in my grubby little soul.&quot; The boy Garath runs away, stays awhile with the cursed people of Ulgos, and eventually finds his way to the Vale of Aldur. Lost, cold, starving, angry with the harshness of life and ready to die, he is taken in by a kind stranger: the god Aldur.<br />Garath the boy-thief grows into Belgarath the Disciple. Here, the other disciples appear, some of them through hilarious situations that only Eddings can pen. Zedar (&quot;he looked like a Tolnedran, or possibly an Arend&quot; - an insult), Kira and Tira the Alorns, Makor the Melcene, Sambar the Angarak, and Din the Dwarf. Each of these sorcerers is well-made and unique and for the most part, fit with the later/previous stories.<br />Unfortunately, Belgarath's character takes a turn here from the colorful character we learned to love in Belgariad/Mallorean. It seems he isn't really quite as bright as we thought him to be. One would think that someone his age would have learned a thing or two in his lifetime. You may say &quot;Well, he's Belgarath, he's taking liberties with his story.&quot; Still, his tales aren't what one would expect from someone as accomplished as Mister Wolf the traveling storyteller. There are far too many discrepancies between this book and the previous ten. There are times even his cunning seems more accidental than planned. The old Belgarath was more fun: the rootless vagabond who drank too much, gambled, chased women (&quot;wenching&quot; - only Eddings could use the term with such aplomb), pocketed things that interested him. The old Belgarath sat in smoky taverns drinking himself into high spirits while he winked at passing barmaids. Since BtS was obviously written after the local Temperance League got their hands on Eddings, we learn that Belgarath wasn't really drinking... he was just making it LOOK like he was. He was only pretending to be drunk so the scary Murgos wouldn't notice him. He wasn't really winking at the pretty barmaids, he was just blinking from all the soot in the air. He wasn't really snoozing in the saddle, he was actually calculating the number of blankets he would need to keep the army warm. His stained, worn, mismatched clothing wasn't accumulated through travels and travails but was carefully designed by the best tailors on the continent. While this new true Belgarath may be politically correct, the old one was more entertaining. The idea of the most powerful sorcerer in the world having numerous flaws and vices made him more believable. Remember, Polgara feared that Belgarath would be a bad influence on the young ones. He wasn't perfect. Well he is now, except for having fewer working brain cells. As strange as this may sound, I felt betrayed.<br />Eddings strains with some of the other major characters in the book. Just because Fulrach and Anheg, Silk and Barak behaved in certain ways shouldn't mean all of their ancestors behaved the same way. Some were indistinguishable from their descendants. On the other hand, the various Salmissras were almost caricaturish in their differences.<br />The Eddings Duo kept their smooth writing style present in the previous ten, and the humor is as sharp as always. When I finished BtS I went back and reread the entire Ten, and alas, Belgarath wasn't the same exciting character I had loved for years.	2001-03-24

There are recipes for every conceivable type of consumable. Beverages (nonalcoholic and alcoholic), appetizers, snacks, candies, jellies, desserts, sauces/toppings, stuffings, and what goes in-between: simple entrees to full-blown multi-course dinners. The instructions are detailed and easy to understand. Unlike cookbooks that tell you to &quot;cut into fillets and braise until done&quot; or &quot;serve with a piquant sauce,&quot; the directions take you through step-by-step, always explaining what is really meant. The ingredients range from items found in any supermarket to the more obscure near-alien things that will require serious searching, although most of the ingredients are quite reasonable. There are numerous illustrations throughout, finally letting mankind in on the secret of why some coffee cakes look like they were made from the inside out.<br />Not just recipes, either. This book includes detailed information on selecting, testing for/maintaining freshness, storing (including an entire chapter on freezing), preparing, and cutting the food. Different types of fruit are explained. Half a dozen pages are devoted to informing the reader about wine. Cuts of beef are explained here; JoC finally explains why chuck is chuck and tip is tip, and where they come from. Table decor, place settings, and appropriate wine glasses are explained too.<br />The writing style is joyful. Clearly, the authors do not just enjoy cooking, serving, and eating the food... they like talking about it, too. There is a gleeful sense of humor throughout, and anecdotes about where the food originated from and how it got its preposterous name. The contents of this cookbook are a treasure.<br />Now for the bad part: the physical book. Had the pages been printed on better quality paper, I would upgrade this poor excuse fora tome to galley status. The paper is clearly manga paper, almost (but not quite) as good as the quality of the phone book paper of your yellow pages, yet not quite as thick. The pages are transparent enough that you do not need to turn the flimsy page to see what is printed on the other side. The text size is small, the same size as the print of the listings in a phone book. The ink quality is atrocious; it's obvious that the photocopying machine used to crank out these pages was running out of toner, giving the book dark-text pages and fuzzy pale-text pages. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether the text is in bold print or if the toner cartridge went into its final death throe. The spiral spine is cheap plastic and does not allow easy page-turning. The quality of this (physical) book is absolutely ridiculous.<br />That's five stars for the content, one star for the physical book.	2001-03-21

This was a fun, colorful book, the Sci-Fi style where the galaxy is well-populated and people/creatures have spaceships and zip from planet to planet the way we have automobiles and drive from town to town. Nevermind the physics and the rocket science. This is more fun!<br />&quot;Santiago&quot; is a legend of truly legendary proportions. Someone hijacked the weapons transport of the toughest navy in this part of the galaxy? Santiago did it. The well-defended space mercenary training compound is now a smoldering crater? It was Santiago! The slaves were not only liberated, but resettled... and presented with the wealth of half a planet? Why, it was Santiago and his gang. Someone overturned the police aircar outside a local post office? It was Santiago, hey that guy was just here!<br />Of course someone as popular/infamous/notorious as Santiago is certain to have a long trail of bounty hunters, amateur and professional, after him. And so he does, one of them Sebastian Nightingale Cain (don't use his middle name in his presence), the most feared bounty hunter of them all. There is an obnoxious freelance journalist looking for the scoop of the century. She'll interview Santiago, or at least cover his death/capture at the hands of Cain. There is a thoroughly disreputable art dealer, he wants some art pieces that Santiago is said to have acquired, and besides, the art dealer needs to leave town fast anyway. They all search for Santiago, going from planet to planet, always one or two steps behind Santiago. Many along the way claim to have seen him. There isn't a photograph or a hologram anywhere... Cain has to really work at this one. Even Santiago's men don't *really* seem to know where Santiago is at this very moment.<br />There is a well-liked minstrel who goes from spaceport to spaceport singing of Santiago's deeds, he was a nice touch.<br />Although much of the story was predictable, as were quite a few of the characters, this book was a fast-paced, exciting read. There are memorable characters and locales too, both good and bad. The character Cain is sure to stick in your mind, it's hard to not like the guy. This is the kind of book that gets read in one sitting. This is the kind of story that will make you smile when you finish, and you'll say &quot;That was fun!&quot;	2001-03-11

This physicist makes an interesting proposal: go back in time and see to it that Reagan never becomes President of the US. After quick trips to a vintage clothier and coin dealer, the mellow Gabriel Prince is indeed in the past... 1938.<br />Gabriel manages to make a decent life for himself in the past. He's got a list of winners for the racetrack, so he quickly has money. He's seen plenty of movies in his lifetime, giving him the opportunity to plagiarize blockbuster movies, so he gets a job as a screenwriter for Warner Brothers. Falls in love with a beautiful B-movie starlet. Hey, maybe this going back in time thing isn't so bad, after all.<br />All this gives Gabriel the opportunity to meet his target, Ronald Reagan. At this point in time, he's still young Dutch &quot;Ree-gan,&quot; an affable and somewhat bumpkinish unknown contract actor. Gabriel is surprised to find himself liking this harmless-seeming man. However, things don't go quite as planned. Not a problem, I'll just use this time machine thingy here and go back again. Handy things, these time machines. Forward and back, back and forth, if something goes wrong, just go back and fix it.<br />The book was, all in all, entertaining. The Hollywood and Los Angeles of the late 1930's was vividly recreated. The politics and society of the old Hollywood movie lots were interesting. The photographs (this book is self-described as &quot;a novel with photographs&quot;) were a nice touch. The empty and desolate Pacific Coast Highway truly does look like a road to nowhere.<br />Now for those flaws. The first jawdroppper I came across was, &quot;Why didn't (the physicist) go back in time himself?&quot; I didn't find the reason he gave Gabriel to be valid or believable. There are two characters from the future who shadow Gabriel; they want the time machine. This wasn't anywhere near as sinister as it sounds, since these two idiots didn't seem competent enough to tie their own shoelaces. When they did enter the scene, I asked myself &quot;Now what mishap is going to befall this bozo *this time*?&quot; And here's one for time travel fans: there is a scene where Gabriel &quot;misses&quot; his targeted time and ends up a few years off. He runs into someone, who immediately and brilliantly deduces &quot;Hey, you walked in my back door, seemed confused and scared. So I knew right away that you are a time traveler.&quot; Huh? Now, on my homeworld, there are plenty of confused looking people walking about. Not once in my life have I ever suspected any of these people to be time travelers. I just figured they were basically normal. Lost maybe, but normal.<br />I found this book to be a fun read. The writing was pretty smooth and flowing. The ending wasn't really an ending. I'd say it's pretty clear the author will make a proper ending in a sequel. Not to be compared with Jack Finney, who is, after all, in a class by himself.	2001-03-09

Mazel boasts to his companion about his popularity; he is welcomed by all, called upon often, and loved by everyone. &quot;No one ever calls for you,&quot; he tells Schlimazel. Scoffing, Schlimazel claims &quot;The world is ruled by the powerful, and what takes you a year to create I can destroy in a second.&quot; So they strike a wager: Mazel will brighten the life of the poorest man in the village for a year. At the end of the year Schlimazel will have one second, just one second, to ruin the man. The man is not to be killed, impoverished, or made ill. A cask of magical wine if Schlimazel wins, if Mazel wins Schlimazel must go away for fifty years. They find the poorest man, Tam, and Mazel goes to work.<br />Through extraordinary good luck (of course), Tam rises from sleeping among toadstools to sleeping in a king's palace. The man the entire village once laughed at becomes the king's trusted advisor and Master of Horses. The fair Princess Nesika, the king's only child and sole heir to the throne, falls in love with him. Tam becomes renown for his wisdom, talent, and skill. Minstrels travel the world recounting tales of Tam's great deeds. How can Schlimazel possibly undo all this in one second?<br />The king falls ill, and only one thing can cure him: the milk of a lioness. Bravely, Tam sets out, Mazel still secretly at his side. The successful Tam returns to the king, and suddenly, the year is up! Schlimazel pops in, and true to his word, in one mere second Schlimazel manages to utterly ruin Tam's life. <br />Mazel wallows in guilt and Schlimazel drinks himself into a stupor with the magical wine. Once unconscious, Mazel returns to Tam's side. After all, with the bet completed, Mazel is free to do as he wishes. With Mazel's deft assistance Tam's life and reputation are restored. Mazel sticks around for a while, but now we are told that Tam no longer needs Mazel: for those who are diligent, honest, sincere, and helpful are indeed lucky forever.<br />A charming story with enchanting watercolor pictures of exotic characters and locales.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-02-09

The Eddingses simply renamed characters from their earlier books, thought up some Bad Evil Guys (who seem incredibly inept, incapable, incompetent and downright stupid, although they do tend to say funny things), and put them in a kinda-sorta Quest situation. They say the same inane things to each other, over and over. As pointed out by other reviewers here, the dialog consists mainly of &quot;Isn't he cute?&quot;, &quot;Be nice, dear&quot;, &quot;Yes, pet&quot; and &quot;I knew you'd see things my way&quot;. And that's throughout the entire book.<br />To be fair, the Prologue, as in other Eddings books, is excellent. The one star goes to the Prologue. The first four chapters were palatable, too. They describe the exploits of Althalus, who is a talented thief, as he decides to check out the Big City. For in the beginning, Althalus' idea of civilization was a semi-permanent mountain camp. So Althalus makes his way down to the Big City and has some entertaining (though thoroughly predictable) adventures. The Big City not quite being the Grand Opportunity that he had expected, Althalus decides to head home. When he gets home, he's hired by a Stranger to steal something. It's all downhill from there.<br />Even more characters from his earlier novels start turning up. Many of these characters are surprisingly acquiescent about being shanghaied into joining The Quest.<br />Now here I'd like to mention that just before starting Althalus, I had finished reading &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; (a book I had looked forward to, and enjoyed) and was shocked at some of the deaths Martin had come up with. Anyway, I sat there, with this Eddings book in hand, hoping, praying.... that some of these horribly boring, annoying and repetitive characters would be killed off. <br />In closing, this is the fantasy book to give to a fantasy cherry (&quot;newb&quot; to some) if you want to permanently turn that person off of fantasy.	2001-01-29

According to the author, it seems some Japanese base everything on sex, that everyone is having sex everywhere all of the time, and that little sex dolls can be purchased everywhere. Reminded me of a famous anthropologist's scandal where the &quot;locals&quot; decided to have a bit of fun with the researcher. While sex in Japan is looked at in a more realistic sense (People understand that some people have sex, and that it's not abnormal), I couldn't quite agree with the author's notions that, come o-matsuri time, couples are enjoying quick trysts under the o-mikoshi or behind the jinja.True, there are sexual references in many (unexpected to the non-Japanese) places: children's manga that make the nude body seem to be anything from nothing out of the ordinary, to embarrassments to be blushed over. Public fliers and posters do show nude bodies, as do regular prime-time TV shows (this is without HBO and Cinemax).<br />The fact is, sexuality is seen differently in the different cultures. Using this book to study the wonderful diversity of people on this planet is great; but using this book as a travel guide when going to Japan might gain the wielder a bit of disappointment. This book covers quite a few areas of Japanese social life. <br />Keep in mind, though, that this book is starting to get a bit out of date. However, it's still fun to read as long as you don't take everything seriously.	2001-01-24

She's also been marooned deep behind enemy lines, on a space station, no less. Her enemies are everywhere. Bet's looking for passage off-station, eventually finding berth on an enemy cruiser whose main job is to hunt down Bet's comrades. Bet's not a squeaky-clean teenager, nor is she a fresh-faced college kid. Bet's a mature woman, with decades of hard combat experience. Something she has to hide while on this enemy vessel.<br />While Commando Yeager is an intriguing character, the other characters, especially those in the space station, seemed very real. Low-level bureaucrats and civil servants in an out-of-the-way station, they behave as any of their kind would anywhere: some are bored and will help a spacer down on her (of his) luck, while some some see themselves as too high and mighty to help anyone at all (and will cause trouble just for the hell of it).<br />Her new shipmates, some of whom are naturally suspicious of this newcomer, sometime seem like a cross of the characters out of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and &quot;Outland&quot; (remember that one)?<br />Was an enjoyable plot, though predictable at times. <br />Recommended for SF buffs who like a bit of intrigue in spacestation-to-LongSpaceVoyage-to-spacestaion stories.	2001-01-24
US	50364769	RPIT1BSH5OEI0	0553581279	51302526	The Silver Metal Lover	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Touching Characters, Breathtaking Scenery	I've loved this book since it first came out, and am glad to see it back in print.<br />In the not-too-near, not-that-far future, a spoiled, naive, sheltered 16-year old daughter of a fabulously wealthy flamboyant single mother ponders and pines away in her ultra-rich castle in the sky, above the clouds. Her friends are equally rich and eccentric, yet they seem to intimidate poor Jane at times, Jane being somewhat shy.<br />Jane meets a life-size, anatomically correct robot, and at first if horrified her... but it more intrigued her (when she was not sober) when she runs into him again at a friend's party. They form a strange, close, intimate bond, this causes Jane (now Jain) to grow up and become an independent adult. Problems arise when the humans, tired of robots taking over &quot;everything,&quot; rebel against the manufacturers of these high-tech companions.<br />The whole story aside, I found Tanith Lee's world to be astounding. The landscapes of the post-catastrophe planet, the architecture of the future buildings, the &quot;simple gadgets&quot; ranging from an automated tea dispenser to the monorail-like public transports. The playgrounds of the shamelessly rich (&quot;The Hanging Gardens of Babylon&quot; center frequented by those with deep pockets).<br />The entire tale is written from Jane's perspective, and it is very calm, cool, introspective and quite real. Jane's colorful friends are just as memorable, and unique, and makes it easy to understand why &quot;Quiet Little Jane&quot; is sometimes embarrassed by them.<br />This was my first Tanith Lee book. A bookbud had long been a fan of her fantasy works, which I know to be prolific, and I've read a few but SML sticks in my mind, reverently.	2001-01-24

Greenberg, and Charles G. Waugh, features a pleasant collection of novellas (13) from some pretty well-respected, &quot;veteran&quot; writers of Sci-Fi.<br />There are two separate tales from the &quot;Thieves' World.&quot; There is a vampire story. A novella about a prophetic dream that may or may not lead to hidden treasure. Then there is the sad tale of an obnoxious adventurer who learns that powerful magic can indeed be wielded by &quot;savages,&quot; and a fun &quot;Conan the Cimmerian&quot; tale in which the intrepid muscleman once again runs into the unflappable Valeria. There is a chilling tale of high magic as wizards and priests fight to control the weather. &quot;The 1970 Nebula Award for Best Novella&quot; is here too: the tale of two thieves in a fantastic society causing trouble over their thievery. There is an &quot;Elric of Melnibone&quot; &quot;novella&quot; here (actually a few chapter excerpts from the second Elric book). There is a tale of a blind woman who takes on a quest to obtain secret knowledge. The antics of Romulus and Remus told from a Faun's point of view. A far-into-the-future world where a Boy Comes of Age, and to end it all, a brave knight rescues a princess and fights a cataclysmic battle between good and evil.<br />While all are definitely in the &quot;Fantasy&quot; genre, each tale is different enough that you shouldn't get too bored. This book might make a good gift for those friends who think all Fantasy consists of endless volumes of martial Elves and warrior Halflings who hold committees about magic rings and godstones, while the Knight Hero sets out to rescue the damsel-in-distress. And it's a fine book for fantasy buffs anywhere. The stories (Many excerpts from what later became novels) were written from 1936 - 1981.<br />The contributors are: Poul Andersen, Suzy McKee Charnas, Avram Davidson, Sir H. Rider Haggard, Robert E. Howard, John Jakes, Fritz Leiber, Michael Moorcock, Janet Morris, Andre Norton, Thomas Burnett Swann, Jack Vance, Roger Zelazny.<br />These tales were a refreshing change from what has become &quot;mainstream&quot; Fantasy.<br />Recommended. Look for it in a used book shop.	2000-12-26

I was expecting to see Royo's fine art depict men, women, aliens, and maybe a spaceship or two, at least a spaceport. Instead I saw beautiful women in assorted stages of bondage and disrepair.<br />While I do not consider myself to be prudish, I still do not see what makes a scared or angry looking, pouting, injured, crying, mutilated, bleeding, bound woman in torn clothing sexy. But that's just me. And no, a scared-looking, pouting, injured, crying, mutilated, blood-covered chained man doesn't do it for me, either.<br />I do not deny the beauty of the female forms depicted in this calendar; the angel-from-Hell is intriguing, and would make a fabulous subject for a poster were she not leashed, and not covered in blood. Only one month features a non-bleeding unchained intact woman.<br />Louis Royo's talent for eliciting thoughts of fantasy is not to be denied, but the art in this calendar is a bit exotic. Not X-rated, just exotic. Perhaps next year there will be a Royo calendar featuring his bookcover art; I would buy that in a heartbeat. Looking at this calendar it's almost hard to believe this is the same guy who did the covers for many popular sci-fi and fantasy books, among them the Matador series, the Dorsai series, Trade Pact Universe series, and Rhapsody series.<br />There is a slight vampire theme in the 2001 calendar, and there is no hint of anything science fiction. The calendar says &quot;Heavy Metal - adult only&quot; on the front, but should have said &quot;Blood-Covered Bondage Babes&quot; instead.<br />I write this review with a full understanding of the First Amendment. I'll probably hang up the calendar in 2001 anyway, and I will be doing some explaining to the people who are sure to raise an eyebrow over it.	2000-11-08
US	50364769	R2USQ8IXC1H46C	0395939461	619220705	The Silmarillion	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Another beautiful coffee table book!	This review is for the hardcover edition, illustrated by Ted Nasmith. I'm going to pretend that everyone reading this already knows what the Silmarillion is about and is familiar with the tales within. Yes, it's a five-star book; I have a dog-eared paperback version that has quite a few combat scars to prove it. I wanted a hardcover book with pretty pictures, a snazzy looking tome to put on an end table. This is it.<br />There are 18 full-page, full color illustrations in this book, plus the front and back of the dustjacket. Unfortunately, I'm one of those people who wanted lots of pictures of Elves doing Elvish things. What the book offers is half pictures of Elves, half pictures of Elven places. Personally, I would have preferred more pictures of the characters in the book, not just the forest glens and oceans and gardens that were instead included. Granted, Nasmith has great talent, and while some of these illustrations are truly gorgeous, I would have liked to see some more warrior-like beings I've seen in his Tolkien calendars. Nasmith did, in fact, also do this year's (2000) calendar.<br />It's a handsome book. Underneath the beautiful glossy dustjacket of Maglor casting a Silmaril into the sea, the book is clothbound in black and embossed in silver. <br />The illustrations are: Maglor Casts a Silmaril Into the Sea, Beren and Luthien are Carried to Safety, The Sea, The Lamp of the Valar, At Lake Cuivienen, The Light of Valinor on the Western Sea, Fingolfin Leads the Host Across the Helcaraxe, The First Dawn of the Sun, Maedhros's Rescue from Thangorodrim, Eol Welcomes Aredhel, Felagund Among Beor's Men, By Moonlight in Neldoreth Forest, Luthien Escapes upon Huan, Morgoth Punishes Hurin, Turin and his Band are Led to Amon Rudh, Finduilas is Led Past Turin at the Sack of Nargothrond, Ulmo Appears before Tuor, Earendil the Mariner, The Eagles of Manwe, The Ships of the Faithful.<br />This book is beautiful, I highly recommend it. It would make a great gift too, even for a non-fan.	2000-11-04
US	50364769	RLRRP4EKACLB2	034541702X	188449651	Kirinyaga	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Amazingly human SF. Outstanding!	In the future, the savannas of Africa have been transformed into farmland, arid cities are no longer dry, many animals are extinct, mountains are devoid of any natural wilderness, and people in search of Paradise can move to unique terraformed planetoids.<br />The planetoid in the story, Kirinyaga (Mountain of Light, the Maasai name for Mount Kenya), is home to a group of ancestral Kikuyu who wished to leave the bustling, high-tech Earth for a back-to-nature lifestyle. Koriba, an educated multilingual man, presides over this simple culture as the mundumugu (witch doctor). Dangerously cunning and self-righteous to a fault, he reads omens, blesses infants, performs marriages, negotiates dowries, places and removes curses, tells stories, operates the computer that controls orbital motions and weather, and generally controls the lives of all in the village. He is a complex man trying to show a simple face, he is a simple man playing a complex role. <br />As anyone who wishes to leave Kirinyaga only needs to walk to the small spaceport and announce an intention to leave, Koriba rules with enough fear and charisma to keep most of the people under his thumb. The people are prisoners only because they allow it.<br />While pure science fiction (complete with spaceships and undersea cities and asteroid colonies), these are extremely human stories. Human nature, not always pretty, is laid out here for all to see. Koriba will turn this society into a &quot;proper&quot; Kikuyu society, no matter what the cost. What can one do? He really *does* control the weather. <br />There are casualties: a young girl who wants more from life than becoming a dutiful Kikuyu wife; a boy who wants to see the world he knows is out there but must choose between his freedom and everything he has known to do so; a civilized Maasai hunter who attempts to take advantage of the trusting and naive villagers; a Kenyan couple who immigrate seeking Shangri-La. Dreams of good people, shattered in the end because of greed, dominance, jealousy. Do they return to modern civilized Earth and live with a wife in a shiny high-rise with perfectly manicured gardens, or do they stay in the mud and grass hut and be tended by their multiple wives? Do they try to change an old and horrifying custom, or do they force mutilation on others? Do they keep people uneducated and illiterate to retain pastoral bliss? What is really lost, or gained? Perhaps technology and civilization aren't that bad, after all.<br />These are moving tales, set in a beautifully imagined world. Koriba, for all his faults, is a tragic character. We come to understand him and sympathize with him. Will he really be happy if he stays only with his own kind? &quot;I am not a Kenyan,&quot; he angrily tells his exasperated son (who stays behind in Nairobi), &quot;I am a Kikuyu.&quot; In his modern world, that means he is alone.<br />Each chapter begins with a short folkloric fable, these little tales of the god Ngai and his animals alone would make a fine book.<br />Kirinyaga was an almost perfect book. I was tempted to take away one star due to the author's afterword. It has been mentioned by another reviewer here, but the exceedingly pompous and arrogant pat on the back Resnick gives himself will make many people do a double-take. While he has plenty of reason to be proud of this book, his self-deification over the &quot;most honored science fiction book in history&quot; (by accident, even) is a bit much. It was interesting how this afterword actually made Koriba seem a bit humble.<br />Highly recommended. <br />(Tear out the author's afterword and read it after you've read all ten chapters.)	2000-11-02
US	50364769	R968XB1NVEMQL	0964279592	742092828	Lexicon Urthus: A Dictionary for the Urth Cycle	Books	3	30	34	N	N	Adequate	This book is useful but is sometimes puzzling.<br />Some of the definitions are simply wrong, in fact some are so far off that you will wonder if Andre-Driussi perhaps is referring to a condensed, abridged, and slightly altered version of the series. Some very minor terms and characters mentioned in passing only once in the series are described here in some detail, while some important terms, places, and incidents integral to the storyline (such as the Torturer's Guild/Order of the Seekers for Truth and Penitence, to which Severian belonged) are not listed at all.<br />Many of the definitions are, well, stretched. This book would be less than half the current size if you threw out all of the example sentences. For instead of just giving the definition, pronunciation and etymology of the listed term, the entry in many cases also gives the full sentence (from the book) in which the word was used. This is not necessary, since the entry also pinpoints the book, chapter, and page in which the term was used in the first place. Takes up a lot of space.<br />Still, this book will save you from browsing through stacks of dictionaries looking for that obscure term. <br />The definition will not always identify what language the word is, but the careful reader can soon learn to tell if it's Greek, Latin, French, or Spanish (as most of the &quot;foreign&quot; words here are). Some terms are defined in detail; they contain many examples of the word (and sentences/book excerpts), with real historical anecdotes, mythological references, hypotheses, comments, and squiggly line drawings. Some entries are short and abrupt: &quot;marge: margin. (IV, chapter 13, 86)&quot;. Sometimes there is no definition at all; all you get for the entry is the sentence the word is in, and the location of the word. I found that rather odd. In some entries, more emphasis is given to explaining the mythological or historical figure rather than the book character (Wolfe named a lot of his characters after saints and Biblical characters).<br />Naturally, this book is full of spoilers. If you aren't at least halfway though the New Sun series, be very careful using Lexicon Urthus!<br />This book has been useful to me, but it's also full of stick-um notes and corrections I had to add myself. It didn't quite do Wolfe's masterpiece justice.	2000-11-02

The soft pastels blend with the glittering jeweltones, and the fantasy settings and gorgeous characters are sumptuously detailed. Each plate is a work of art and suitable for framing; believe me, if you have a color scanner/printer you'll be grateful. Notes at the end of the book inform us that the illustrations are reproduced from the original gouache paintings, and the pages are in heavy glossy paper.<br />There are four tales in this volume: The Firebird, Maria Morevna, Vassilissa the Fair, The Snow Maiden.<br />The pictures will take your breath away. The stories are charming and well translated (from an older Russian translated into French volume), but you will probably be too taken away by the glorious art to really pay much attention to the not-really-for-small-children fairy tales.	2000-10-29

Excellent ephemerides.<br />The first part, the Starlist, has been an indispensable source of information. Stars are listed by constellation and includes: RA/Dec, spectral classification, absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, distance (in light years), parallax, proper motion, direction of apparent motion (disregarding precession), space velocity, radial velocity (where known), size (in solar diameters), luminosity, and Henry Draper Catalogue star reference number (HD). There are many remarks/comments throughout, on various stars. These remarks are concise and helpful, and show Mr. Dibon-Smith's love for the field. Think of it as a one volume condensed Burnham's Celestial Handbook.<br />The second section of this book, visual binaries, includes the combined magnitude, apparent magnitude of each component (with a few exceptions, only the brightest pair of a multiple system), PA/Sep, and orbital information. At the end of the section is a graphic representation of the orbits of binaries with periods of 300 years or less. <br />The third section, variable stars. They are listed by subgroup: pulsating, eruptive, rotating, peculiar, eclipsing, and type uncertain. The first part has graphs of the maxima/minima of Mira type stars, and some semiregular variable stars. Part three also lists type of variable, maximum range, epoch, period, and best viewing dates.<br />That's not all this book offers. There is a section on computer programs (in BASIC) to find: day of the week (given the Julian date), Julian date (given the calendar date), calendar date/day of the week (given the Julian date), position of a star (given the RA/Dec and latitude/longitude of the observer), RA on the meridian (given the calendar date), midnight transit of a star (given the RA), and the approximate date of maxima of a long-period variable. Another section lists stars by RA. Another section identifies star names (fun if you had no idea where Zubenalgubi is...it's Sigma Librae). The bibliography and indices are also helpful.<br />I learned that this book is also tons-o-fun for the science fiction buff, too. So, the space ninja chased the nasty asteroid pirates all the way to Phi Eridani, did they? Well, now you'll know that Phi Eridani is a B8 V, and 180 light years away.<br />Seriously, this book has been indispensable. It's fun to browse though for kicks, and it's extremely helpful if you're into Astronomy.	2000-10-28

Not for children.	&quot;One morning it was...the Middle Ages&quot; begins this dark fable.<br />Young Snickup and the divinely beautiful Superfecta, two wards of an orphanage in a small village in the Netherlands, seem utterly devoted to one another. When of age, they are betrothed and exchange betrothal gifts...two white doves for Superfecta, a wondrous blue cloak for young Master Snickup. An excellent match. All seems perfect.<br />Meanwhile, a wealthy burgher, Mijnheer van Cats, continues to look for a wife. Van Cats is a man of many vices and he owns the notorious Black Windmill, but since he is quite rich, the local merchants and guildmasters are more than happy to offer him their daughters. Van Cats is not interested. Unfortunately one evening, van Cats spots Superfecta (whose beauty is without peer) in the guildhall. He sends her a gift of gold...and without hesitation she agrees to marry him.<br />The heartbroken Master Snickup, now dressed in nothing but the blue betrothal cloak, departs on a long pilgrimage across Europe. He eventually settles on a tiny island in the Black Sea, where he prays and fasts while demons tempt and torment him.<br />During this time Superfecta has had a son, the son van Cats so badly wanted. Alas this son does little to calm the choleric man, as van Cats beats his wife, verbally abuses her in town, and gets into the habit of locking her up some nights in the Black Windmill. The village itself has grown prosperous, but the tiny little orphanage where Snickup and Superfecta grew up is ignored amidst the greed and eventually falls to ruin, utterly forgotten.<br />Still on his tiny island of rock, Snickup continues to pray. His once wondrous blue cloak is in tatters now and infested by all sorts of vermin. However, Snickup's soul has grown pure. Having found his release, Snickup dies. Noticing their host has died, the vermin take flight...including a small flea, which heads for the trading port of Kaffa. We are told the year now is 1346.<br />Back inthe village, the half-witted son of van Cats hangs around the town brothel, which once was the town orphanage. Patrons laugh until they cry at the favorite story of its madam: she once the town beauty. Unbelievable! Not this hideous woman! Partially due to this, the brothel does very well and the town continues to prosper. Trading ships come from far and near, laden with goods and gold.<br />Soon, strange things start to happen. The air starts to smell bad. Food rots quickly. People and animals start dying in droves. God starts ignoring the prayers of the pious and sinful alike. The sailors from the merchant ships tell horrifying tales of the death and disease that seems to be everywhere. No amount of prayer seems to help. Hell has arrived.<br />Mijnheer van Cats, unable to cope with events, ends his life in the Black Windmill. The brothel's madam, despite all her efforts, contracts the disease as well. Nothing could end the Black Plague...it took its casualties, moved on, and took its casualties.<br />This book was a gift to me many, many years ago. Although it horrified me at the time, it has remained one of my very favorite books. Brian Froud's artwork is simply breathtaking (although macabre)! His work is exquisitely, minutely detailed. Even after all these years, I take this book out and find new details in the artwork. Alexander Theroux's prose is haunting; beautiful and charming at the beginning of the tale, dark and terrifying by the end.<br />The physical effects of the Black Plague are graphically detailed in this book, as are the bizarre efforts taken by the townspeople to thwart the disease. The art in beginning is cute and elfin; the art the end is the stuff of nightmares.<br />Very highly recommended, but definitely, absolutely not for children.	2000-10-28

I bought this book because I wanted a hardcover illustrated fancy version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.<br />I'm just going to pretend that everyone who reads this review has already read &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and knows what it's about. Like I suspect many others do, I have my own old sacred tattered and dog-eared paperback version on the Tolkien bookshelf.<br />This book (the physical object, not just the story) is beautiful. It's clothbound in dark green and embossed in gold, and the bottom corner of the front cover has a gold embossed dragon, tastefully rendered. The paper dustjacket/cover features a dragon as well (I'm guessing Smaug). Eye-catching.<br />There are many full-page color paintings, and many grayscale drawings (not full page) throughout. I'm not an art student, so I don't know what they're really called. Pencil-drawings or something. I call them grayscale because they're gray. Anyway, the Allen Lee illustrations are utterly charming, soft and colorful without being too bright. However, I wouldn't recommend this illustrated book for very young children; some of the goblins and trolls are frightening!<br />I was a bit disappointed that Alan Lee didn't include more illustrations of Elves. Most of the pictures dealt with Bilbo and the dwarves, with a few of goblins and Gollum (scary). Also, I pictured Bilbo Baggins to be somewhat on the &quot;stout&quot; side...the text *does* refer to Hobbits as being &quot;inclined to be fat in the stomach&quot; and liking two dinners a day, &quot;when they can get it.&quot; The Bilbo Baggins in these illustrations is quite slender and looks as if he could use that second dinner right away! Maybe even a third and fourth! The balding, skinny Hobbit did surprise me. But then, I kind of expected the chubby halfling I saw on some old Tolkien calendars.<br />This book makes a wonderful coffee table book and would make a great gift. It's printed on thick glossy paper, so the book is heavy.
