This is a good book as far as books with nothing but photos go. There are a lot of good pictures of beautiful lions, which of course I adore since I do love big cats very much, and it shows them hunting, eating, fighting, playing, roaring, and even rolling around in the mud. And those that show them asleep shows them rolled on their backs. Very cute. If you like lions and other cool predators like I do, then you should read this book. Unfortunately, I cannot give it five stars because there is no information but captions. It is good other than that, but I still wish there were writing so I could learn more about the lives of what I think is the best and coolest animal ever to exist. At least it's still good overall.	2005-10-06

Big cats may be my favorite animals, and next to them hyenas, wolves, little cats, sharks, dolphins, and whales, but reptiles are still one of my favorite kinds of animal. This is an excellent book. It shows you all sorts of reptiles, and how they live, eat, mate and protect themselves. It even shows things like venomous snakes and Komodo dragons. The things you learn are really cool, just like the reptiles, in fact. I think any nature lover needs this. End of story.	2005-09-22

Sharks are so damn cool(the only animals cooler are of course little cats, wolves, hyenas, and big cats)and this book has so much to show about their lives! Good God, I mean, the photographs are beautiful and/or cool looking, the many species of shark are given full respect and are shown in both art and photo, lots of amazing information is given on everything from tiger sharks(my favorite shark of all time)great whites, makos, hammerheads, grey sharks, whitetips, blacktips, lemon sharks, blue sharks, whale sharks, basking sharks, megamouths, & all the other species of this cool animal that lives in the ocean. Also, it tells how many people study them. Any shark lover needs to get this RIGHT NOW!	2005-09-22

This book is great! Jaguars are my # 3 favorite animal of all time next to lions and tigers, and this book was really good. I liked the many facts I learned from it, and the jaguars in the photos were gorgeous. The only drawback is that the pictures were in black and white(I would have preffered color)but other than that, this is quite the marvelous book on nature in the form of the jaguar. There is a lot of interesting stuff to read in this, and you'll even see a jaguar or two swimming, mating, and rolling playfully on his/her back. If you like nature, especially the big cats, this book is for you. If you want to visit South America, read this first so you'll have fun taking pictures. Sense a trend here? I thought so. This book is very worthy of your pay. End of story. Oh, and wait till you see the cool things they do and the cute cubs. You'll smile ear to ear. Without any doubt.	2005-09-15

Believe me, I like this book. I like this book a lot. There's much to enjoy in it(especially if you are a Marvel and/or DC fan)and of course it is cool to the core. Here are all of the pros and cons: <br /> <br />Pros: <br /> <br />Punisher is just as vicious on criminals, but just as caring for the innocent, as he ever was the day he became a tough vigilante.  <br /> <br />The fight scenes are superb, and you will really like the huge and thunderous impacts, and also the WHAMs and POWs and all that. <br /> <br />Many other cool characters appear along with Castle. They are of course Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Wolverine. All these guys rock and I think the way they team up yet argue is quite funny. <br /> <br />There is non-stop action, and the art is nearly perfect. Also, the Hulk appears, fighting on neither side and being hilariously out of control.  <br /> <br />There are many memorable quotes in this book, such as \\"I said I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger.\\" and \\"Go to hell!\\"(from Daredevil to Punisher)Others include \\"You can tell the sun not to rise in the morning. But it will just come up anyway.\\" All this and more. <br /> <br />Spacker Dave appears for the last time. I think he's sorta funny. <br /> <br />Cons:  <br /> <br />I wish Jigsaw appeared in this. He's my favorite Punisher villain  and a fight between him and Castle really would've rocked.  <br /> <br />Even if the three against Castle meant well, why was Daredevil doing it? He's killed people before. Or at least tried to(Ahem, Bullseye!)Spider-Man has teamed up with Castle repeatedly. Helped him defeat crime. Why would he, of all people, turn on an ally? Wolverine is the one who likes Punisher the most. What Castle did must have been an accident. Besides, Wolverine may have said that he was going to stop Castle killing, but Wolverine is a killer of crime himself! As said in one review, he probably has a higher body count than Punisher. What the (BEEP) is going on here, huh? <br /> <br /> <br />Allin all and overall, this is a great 5 issue collection of comics. I like it very much, it is one of the best, and it is pure spun gold(or black?)It is a must have for any Punisher fan.	2005-09-13

It is full of useful  and interesting facts, and also many full color, beautiful and cool looking photographs of the king of beasts. It shows lions hunting, eating, roaring, fighting, running, playing, and all other things that they do when they're not asleep. It also tells you what they eat, how they mate and defend the pride, and even true stories on real lions or lionesses given names by naturalists. Lions always have been and always will be my favorite animal ever(followed by tigers and jaguars, of course)and this book absolutely rocked. In terms of itself and my world. I recommend this to all nature lovers around the world, thoroughly and completely. Oh, and let's not forget totally and utterly.	2005-09-10

This is a totally awesome book! It has Daredevil and Elektra, who are # 2 and 3 in my Marvel Knights Lineup(Punisher would be # 1)and throughout the book they kick a lot of butt! Also in this book are other cool heroes like Luke Cage and Iron Fist, and of course all of your favorite Daredevil villains like Bullseye and Kingpin! I of course would rank those two in the order above. The fight scenes are well written and well drawn as well as intense, and you'll love Kirigi, too!(He is my # 1 favorite Elektra villain, and very fierce  and vicious and skilled)On top of all of that, this is a collection of comics that, if purchased separately, would cost over $200.00. If you like tough comics such as Daredevil, buy this without hesitation. It is a classic treasure. Oh, and people like Sewer King appear, too. THIS BOOK ROCKS!

This is the best book on prehistoric animals I've ever spent money on! Even better than walking with dinosaurs! The photos are nearly real, if not completely, the information is wonderful for everyone age 11 and up, and every piece of the book is perfect for all who like cool animals, prehistoric or modern day! My favorite was the chapter with the Smilodons(they are my favorite prehistoric animal of all time, of course!)It was cool, and so were all the other huge chapters! Oh, and the mammoths rocked, as well, I might add. I will tell you this, too-this book is educational and fun. You should give it to any nature lover! It is absolutely superb.

It has lots of cool photos(which are as real as dinosaurs get)and the information is stunningly useful and cool. Also, there is plenty of blood, for you gore lovers, and all sorts of fighting, mating, eating, moving, and roaring among every dinosaur, be it carnivore or herbivore. I should add that the carnivores are as nasty as they should be, and the herbivores are as tough as they should be. If you like dinosaur stuff, then this book is for you. I highly recommend it to anybody 12 or older. It's a cool book, and it has more cool prehistoric animals along with dinos, too. In the sea, air, and on the land.	2005-08-26

Batman shows many of his cool fighting abilities, and Robin actually fights for himself and saves his own life even though he's just a kid. Plus, many of my favorite Bat-Villains were in this book. Here's the pros and cons: <br /> <br />Pros: <br /> <br />Joker, Bane, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Riddler, and Scarecrow, my # 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10 favorite Bat-villains, are featured here and are almost everything they should be. Point off there. Really.  <br /> <br />There are many cool fight scenes, and some grisly killings, too. <br /> <br />The art is superb, and so are the writing and backround.  <br /> <br />There is plenty of intense terror. Batman comics always should have that. <br /> <br />I was introduced to some villains I never knew before.  <br /> <br />I liked the final fight with Batman and Bane A LOT! <br /> <br />Cons:  <br /> <br />Joker, Poison Ivy, and Riddler don't get a chance to show what they can really do. They need more comic space. I'll get more Batman comics featuring these villains. <br /> <br />Ra's Al Ghul, who is my second favorite Batman villain next to the Joker, does not appear. It would be cooler if # 2 showed in this comic. A lot cooler. Give me one with 2 in between 1 & 3! <br /> <br />Catwoman and Batgirl, my next two favorite Bat-heroes next to who else but Batman himself, don't appear either. I want more babes.  <br /> <br />Overall, this Batman comic book is awesome, and I highly and totally recommend it to anyone who likes superhero comic books. End of story.	2005-08-26

It's packed to the brim with action, & Punisher himself sways between doing what he does because he cares for innocents and/or because he loathes criminals. I thought Joan the mouse was kinda cute, and that Spacker Dave and Mr. Bumpo were just really classic clowns! I call them \\"Feed me!\\" and \\"Check out my cool facial rings!\\" On top of that, there is something else I must say about this comic. Along with being action packed and real interesting, it was totally and absolutely hilarious. There were a lot of funny quotes and laughable scenes. Oh, and the part of the book where Punisher smothered the Russian with the 1,200 pound Mr. Bumpo? THAT WAS A CLASSIC AND RIOTABLE JOKE OF HILARITY! Oh, and speaking of the Russian(who is my # 2 favorite Punisher villain next to Jigsaw), he was not only a cool villain, he was also a funny villain(like many hero and villain characters)I mean, where to begin? He called Castle \\"Big Boy\\" when he himself is bigger than a tiger, instead of using real weapons as weapons,he used things like a toilets & refrigerators (GUFFAW!)and he dressed like a sailor and talked in incomplete sentences! Ma Gnucci, another villain, was quite funny with all of her snappishness and whining, but enough on the villains(even though they rock)On to other good stuff, which includes the very skilled artwork and even a pretty woman. Whatever, if you like the Punisher or any Marvel or DC comic or in fact anything that involves action or comedy, then you should definitely get this book. It is well worth your 26.00 and I recommend it to everyone.	2005-08-16

It has many great photographs, and of course lots of good information on many different animals.

I think anyone who likes lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos, hyenas, cheetahs, hippos, or any other cool and beautiful animals that nature offers should buy this book.

This is one of the best nature books, or for that matter one of the best books I've ever read in my life!

Also, on top of that, it even takes us into the lives of many true lions,  and even goes so far as to show us pictures of a lion or lioness's face close up or the animals it lives with, such as leopards, wild dogs, hyenas, cheetahs, jackals, elephants, and vultures.

They are-Storm # 10, Jean Grey/Pheonix #9, Beast # 8, Cyclops # 5, Nightcrawler # 3, Colossus # 2, and the all powerful Wolverine, # 1! Only top 10 X-Men who aren't there are Gambit # 7, Psylocke # 6, and Rouge # 4, and this is only because they hadn't appeared yet at the time of these comics! Oh, and there are many other cool villains the X-Men face along with Magneto in this gold collection, such as Juggernaut, my # 8 favorite X-Villain as well as quite a few who aren't in my top 10, but are still very cool baddies. Also, the fight scenes and arguments among X-Men in this book are both cool  and funny. A mixture of the two.

This is a good book. It has great art, and the characters in it are pretty cool, especially people like Owl, Stilt-Man, Mister Fear, Electro, and Gladiator. Plus, it shows Daredevil's origin and his earliest and most surprising appearences and fights, including a fight with the one and only Spider-Man. It is a good collection, and it is a must have for any Daredevil lover. However, I can't give it 5 stars because it didn't have any of my top 3 favorite DD villains of all time in it-Mr. Hyde, my # 3 favorite, Kingpin, my #  2 favorite, and of course Bullseye, my # 1 favorite-none of those top and classic baddies were in this book.

Throughout this whole book, Frank Castle AKA The Punisher saves lots of innocents, offs lots of evildoers, fights with many heroes(like Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Captain America)as well as the baddies he faces, and does just about everything to put him in the Marvel Heroes Hall Of Fame.

I suggest and recommend it to all who like to read or like nature, and I will certainly be happy to hear their great reviews, as well as my own. Let's hear some trumpeting.	2005-07-27

THIS IS THE BEST TIGER BOOK I'VE EVER READ(so far)! The photos are classic, the information is great, and you can most certainly tell that the writers and photographers put a ton or two of effort into it. If you like tigers(like many do)I suggest you buy this book. Oh    and tigers come only a couple of inches away from being tied on my love scale with my favorite animal, the lion, so it makes this book  all the better! Anyway, I love it to pieces, and you will too! Get it while it's fresh, off this site, or in any book or nature store!	2005-07-26

Lions are and always have been my favorite animal in the world, with tigers very close to a tie. This book is filled with terrific and fun info on the golden king of beasts(not king of the jungle, it lives on the African plains, DUH!)and the photos are out of this world. In fact, you might even say that the lions in the pictures are the most buff and beautiful felines you've ever seen. Any lion lover needs this book immediately, it gives lions full respect and glory, nuff said! Buy it when you get the chance!	2005-07-26

This book is quite good and well written. I like it very much. The information is perfect for anyone who wants to learn and the photos are absolutely stunning. I thank amazon.com for this and for the many reccomendations they've given me. As a matter of fact, quite a few are things I'd like. Oh, yeah, back to the book. I liked it all through and through, and the only reason I don't give it five stars is that it could have used a few more jaguar pictures. Whatever, it is a grand book and I will own it for all time.	2005-07-18

Leopards are my # 4 favorite animals of all time topped only by jaguars, tigers, and of course lions. I think they are both cool and beautiful. I loved all the ones in here, most definitely the female ones. They were the most cool and beautiful. The only bad part was any of them getting hurt or killed, but other than that this book rocked! The cubs were cute, also. And boy, did I ever learn a lot about lions and hyenas as well as leopards. Like I said, this is a terrific book. I own it at home and will own it until my dying day. I highly reccomend it to anyone over the age of 12. Man, oh man, Amazon.com, you keep up making books like this.	2005-07-17

I love wolves! They are one of my favorite animals! They are awesome and good looking, and their howls really light up my day(and night!)And boy, if anything was ever meant to be a canine, it was the wolf. Anyway, this book was great overall and I enjoyed it quite a lot. The photos rocked and the information was out of this world. It could've used more than just the four big seasons where wolves do different things, though. Whatever. It was a terrific book, and I like it a lot. This is a must have for any wolf lover. Or any carnivore lover. Okay, I'll be blunt. This is a must-have for people who like cool stuff as well as animals. Period.	2005-07-17
