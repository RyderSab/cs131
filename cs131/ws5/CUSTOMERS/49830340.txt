One of her teachers, Lord Wyldon, put her on probation to see if she can make it. One of her friends (and her sponser), Neal, stand up for her, and joined her patrols at night, seeing if Joren was picking on any first years. Will Kel be able to come back the next year? Will she be able to get rid of the handsome Joren? Will Lord Wyldon trear her fairly? Will Kel ever be treated fairly? <br />All these questions are easy to answer, and dont take that long to find. All you have to do is read the book. It isnt one of those books that take for ever to read, it took me less than a day! :)<br />And thank you Mrs. Tamora Pierce	2000-12-27
