It's a witty sci-fi/mystery. Lethem's books are always interesting and usually funny, and I seem to be able to &quot;hear&quot; them as I'm reading because he captures the narrator's voice so well. In this book, the narrator is a Private Inquisitor named Conrad Metcalf. Metcalf sounds exactly like a Raymond Chandler PI. Chandler's style is often imitated, but Lethem really seems to nail it - enough to bring a huge grin to my face as I read. Here's an example:<br />She and Stanhunt had been freshly separated, and the electricity between them had still been going strong--back when Stanhunt was still capable of generating electricity. Now there was a blackout. I wondered if the lady behaved any differently in the dark. I wondered if maybe she was the one who cut the wires.<br />Now, if you watch &quot;Between the Lions&quot; at all, use your best &quot;My name is Spud, Sam Spud...&quot; voice to read that and you'll know just what I mean.<br />Lethem's got a heck of an imagination too. Metcalf's world has evolved animals in addition to the regular people, and Lethem really knows where to insert them. There's a kitten who gives Metcalf the opportunity to use the line: &quot;Hello, little girl.&quot; There are rabbits in the dentist's office and an Irish Setter who delivers for the local deli. Good stuff.<br />This book is going to be so much fun to finish. I hope I can make it last more than a day or two!	2002-11-25

The novel is graphic in its portrayal of poverty, prostitution and dissection of cadavers, so if you don't want the gory details, you probably should avoid this book. The author uses a unique narrative style with multiple mystery narrators and frequent questions of the reader. At first, it annoyed me, but it grew on me after awhile.

Kids will love the creative ways the Baudelaire children escape never-ending peril, and adults will get a kick out of the many literary references worked into the story. This book had references to Woolf, Salinger, the Jonah story from the Bible and much more. Just check the names of the patients in the hospital.<br />If your child is 8-12 years old, get these books. Even better, read them aloud together. These books beg to be read out loud.	2002-10-31

It's got ferishers (fairies, but they don't like to be called that), werecreatures, a Sasquatch, giants, and more. But, most of all, it's got baseball. I can't begin to describe this book to you...it's an adventure story on a grand scale. It was written for children, but like Lewis's Narnia Chronicles, adults will find it wonder-full too.<br />My favorite quote in the book (and I'll probably misquote it here, since I'm doing it from memory) is that \\"a baseball game is nothing but a great slow contraption for getting you to pay attention to the cadence of a summer day.\\" How true. I can't wait to read this to my baseball-loving son.	2002-10-28

A book that begins with the [way it does] doesn't seem like something you could call a \\"happy\\" book, and I guess it's not. But it is a hopeful book. It's about loss, sadness, healing and love.

They're not like anything else I've read, but I find them fascinating. &quot;Girl in Landscape&quot; is the story of Pella Marsh, a young girl who's just lost her mother and is trying to learn to be a woman in a VERY strange new world. Lethem always finds an interesting way to look at the English language. In &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, he used a 30-year-old orphan with Tourette's Syndrome as a narrator -- great book, by the way. In this book, he uses the &quot;Archbuilders&quot; - the ones who built the society on this new planet, but have since moved on - to explore the way our words often mean much more (or less) than we intend.<br />Lethem's not for everyone, but you should try at least one of his genre-busting books, just to see what he can do.	2002-10-28

I'd never read her books, but when I saw the cover of this one, I thought it looked fun. I'm happy to say it was. I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Robin Hudson, not-so-mild-mannered TV journalist. Robin's having a rough time right now...her husband left her for a much younger woman, she's been demoted to Special Reports due to a couple of fairly serious on-air faux pas, and now someone's trying to kill her.<br />I got a total kick out of this book because I liked the heroine immediately, and according to my brother and his wife, the newsroom stuff is dead-on accurate. This book isn't laugh out loud funny like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books, but I liked the character and story just as well. I'm going to read the rest of the books in this series.	2002-10-28

They both write beautifully. Although their books are usually pretty hefty (in weight and subject matter), they don't waste a single word.<br />This book differs from most of Irving's work in that it's a collection of memoirs, short fiction and essays. There's lots of wrestling in this book, as one would expect from an Irving memoir. I've read that some people found those sections tedious; I didn't. As far as I'm concerned, the book is worth purchasing even if you read nothing but the section about having dinner at the White House. I had to read it out loud to my husband (which was difficult, since I was laughing the entire time).<br />I also enjoyed the short fiction and essays. Matter of fact, though I didn't enjoy Dickens as a youngster, I'm tempted to read him again after Irving's essays.	2002-10-28

I really liked Ellroy's \\"Black Dahlia\\", \\"L.A. Confidential\\" and \\"American Tabloid\\" but I couldn't make myself finish this book. It's a sequel to \\"American Tabloid\\" and explores the cover-up behind the JFK assassination. It's graphically violent, but that's not what turned me off. Ellroy's rapid-fire style is overdone in this book. In the first 120 pages (as far as I was able to read), I bet there wasn't a sentence that was more than 5 or 6 words long. Most were three. The paragraphs were one or two sentences at most. It felt like reading \\"Dick shot Jane.\\" Here's an example from the first page of the novel: \\"The Casino Operators Council flew him. They supplied first-class fare. They tapped their slush fund. They greased him. They fed him six cold.\\" Ugh. I simply couldn't face another 440 pages of this.<br />Ellroy's been hailed as a writer of classic noir. Up to this point, I'd have agreed. I'm sure there are some out there that will get a kick out of his style. But, this time around, I'm not one of them.	2002-10-28

Lansdale is one of the best storytellers I've read lately. I could almost hear the book in my head as I read. \\"The Bottoms\\" is somewhat like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", but it's definitely its own story. It combines an analysis of the evils of racism with a young boy's coming-of-age story. There are elements of mystery and horror in the book as well. Give it a chance.

This is one of his most lighthearted works to date. Several times I laughed out loud...one of the funniest images was that of a noted hand surgeon using a lacrosse stick to fling dog poo into the Charles River. Ridiculous, I know, but it cracked me up.<br />This book also had a quote I loved: &quot;Good novels and films are not like the news, or what passes for the news--they are more than items. They are comprised of the whole range of moods you are in when you read them or see them. You can never exactly intimate someone else's love of a movie or a book, Patrick now believed.&quot; That is so true. Recommendations are wonderful, but reading is such a personal experience.<br />I think Irving's at a point in his life where he's truly happy. This book is hopeful, joyous and funny. It's also shorter than some of his more recent stuff - at about 300 pages, it's a good way to get a quick Irving fix.	2002-10-28

They're unique in that each new book alternates point of view. For example, Winter and Night is narrated by Bill Smith. The previous book, Reflecting the Sky, was narrated by Lydia. Bill and Lydia are polar opposites which makes for lots of dramatic tension. But, as far as I'm concerned, the dialogue is the best part of the book. Rozan's dialogue is at least as good as Elmore Leonard's. Maybe better.<br />Anyway, if you haven't read this series, you really should give it a chance.

It was a truly funny book about angels, archangels, the Horsemen of the Apocalypse and one very confused Anti-Christ. Since then, I've read just about everything Pratchett has available in the US, but I'd never read another Gaiman book. After reading the great reviews, I figured \\"American Gods\\" should be the one.<br />It's obvious Pratchett and Gaiman have had some major philosophical discussions (perhaps over a pint or two). The first Pratchett book I read was \\"Small Gods\\". The premise was that gods die or disappear if people no longer believe in them. Gaiman's book explores the same theme, but on a grander scale. It felt somewhat like reading Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" - if you've read both, you'll know why I think so - they're epic adventures including journeys and battles between two mythical forces. Both were interesting reads. Gaiman's obviously done his research on Norse and Egyptian mythology and voudon. You can't help but be interested in a book with characters like Odin, Loki, Anubis and Bast. It also has leprechauns, piskies, and one very determined zombie.<br />For some reason, a bumper-sticker thought kept popping in my head as I read this book: Gods Are People Too.	2002-10-28

I didn't buy it.<br />The characters were all frustrating - prostitute momma, terminally ill sister, lobotomized granny, stereotypical God-fearing Southern black man - it just drove me nuts.<br />Part of my problem with this book is that I'm so tired of reading about dysfunctional families. I realize there needs to be some dramatic tension, but it seems like this is becoming a sub-genre all its own.<br />I'm going to stick with books like Richard Russo's \\"Empire Falls\\". The characters are still experiencing problems, but because it's written so beautifully, they are sympathetic and believable.	2002-10-28

I don't usually buy sports books. I think the only other one I've read is &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;. Granted, &quot;Seabsiscuit&quot; was a terrific book. It's just that I tend towards fiction most of the time. That said, this was a really fun book to read. I grew up 20 miles from the UT campus and have never lived more than 90 miles from UT or A&amp;M. Kip's done a great job capturing the spirit of both schools and explaining just why people get so rabid about a football game. There are also some very moving descriptions of the '99 Bonfire disaster and the amazing red, white and blue-out of Kyle Field the first game following 9/11.<br />If you are a native Texan, buy this book because you'll love reading about all the familiar sights and sounds. If you're not a native Texan, buy this book...maybe you'll understand why we love this place so much. (By the way, the author was born an Okie, but seems to really know what Texas is all about).	2002-09-16

Really well written, suspenseful, very well-drawn characters. I enjoy historical fiction, so this was a real treat. It's sort of a suspense novel, but also introduces you to the mechanics behind the illusions created by the magicians of the '20's, '30's and '40's (Houdini, etc.) It has great historical tidbits about the Secret Service and President Warren G. Harding too. I read 200 - 300 books a year, and I'd say this was at the top of my list for this year so far.<br />Also recommended: The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay - Michael Chabon, The Lovely Bones - Alice Sebold (Gold's wife), Empire Falls - Richard Russo, Restoration - Rose Tremain	2002-09-10

It has well-drawn, colorful illustrations and rhyming text.  The rhymes are musical enough that we've been reading it as a bedtime story for about two weeks, and though it's a little complex for a two year old, my son can &quot;read&quot; most of it to me.  While it doesn't contain the blood and gore you'd usually associate with knights, it does have jousts, dragons, swords and flails - all presented in a non-frightening way - so it's perfect for bedtime adventure.<br />Buy this book and enjoy reading it out loud to your little ones.	2000-12-15
