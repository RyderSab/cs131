Because this book is for some reason unaviable in Canada, I ordered it from amazon.co.uk and was not in the least disappointed. The book contains much less detail on the social conditions than his \\"Definitive History\\" in favour of a complete history of the case. While in some ways, this book contains less detail on certain aspects than Sugden does, it still, in my opinion, deserves to be ranked with it as the best comprehensive account of the case because it deals with much of the more recent research on the case and still provides a wealth detail, not all of which is in Sugden. The book provides an overview of the case, and covers the expected ground, with chapters on each of the canonical victims (including Tabram), Leather Apron, the letters (with significant detail on the Dear Boss and Lusk letters), the police, the reactions/climate in Whitechapel and London, and the Macnaghten Memorandum. All the chapters contain references to primary sources, mostly quotes from newspapers and police reports. <br />The suspect oriented chapters on the case include Druitt, Ostrog, Kosminski and Tumbelty. There is also a small section in the Kosminski chapter on Fido's \\"David Cohen\\" theory, which in my opinion, despite the dificulties, is the best one out there (I think the confusion of suspects and Anderson's veracity cannot be so easily dismissed). A final chapter briefly discusses, and refutes, various other suspect theories, including the royal theory, Sickert and Maybrick. There are also a few pages of Chapman/Klosowski in chapter 8. There are also the standard victim pictures in the book and pictures of the murder sites. There are also pictures of many of the notable police officers involved in the case as well as two photos of the Swanson marginalia. <br />Begg's account is, in many respects, as conservative as Sugden's, correctly I think. For example, they both express agnosticism about authenticity of the Lusk kidney, and deem Packer completely unreliable. <br />There are also differences between Begg's account and Sugden's, giving the book a certain enjoyable idiosyncratic flavour. Sugden and Begg both add Tabram as a probable sixth canonical victim (in my opinion quite rightly), and plausibly discount Smith, Coles and Mackenzie. However, while Sugden includes Millwood and excludes Wilson, Begg discounts Millwood and makes a case Wilson. One final, and perhaps the biggest, difference between the two is that Sugden argued that George Chapman/Klosowski is the only known suspect who could have been, and perhaps was, the killer, Begg all but discounts Chapman seems to tacitly favour Kosminski, although he rightly acknowledges a lack any definitive evidence. While Ripperologists will probably have to die not knowing anything for certain, one cannot help but obssessively keep working at it and Begg's work is basically the best we can do.	2005-02-26

It would be difficult to do this book justice in a review.  It is by far the most cogent and coherent case for the perils of censorship and the recent consequences most people in Canada seem to have missed. Cotler, Matsuda, Mackinnon, Delgado and the all-too-many censors in this society (who nonetheless assure us that they care for free speech) would do well to read this book.  Not only do these censors push for measures that have been used to undermine their very goals (eg Little Sister's case), which ought to make them just as responsible, but they cannot, without being dimwitted or deceitful, continue to push for 'hate' censorship without a serious response to the difficulties posed in this book.  There are too many examples of censorship (esp. censorship gone awry) in Canada that go well beyond what the self-proclaimed guardians want, yet that never seems to give anyone pause. <br />The book is tightly argued and quite dense, in that every page directly contributes to the overall argument. <br />I cannot recommend this book enough for anyone interested in censorship in Canada (which could learn a thing or two from the US supreme court despite the inane appeal to 'cultural differences' to avoid that).  Braun should be commended for his powerful case, as Canada has a severe shortage of the likes of Black, Douglas and Brennan.	2005-02-04

Justic Goldberg summed up the result: \\"A public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with 'actual malice'--that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\\"  It was, according to Lewis, a victory for free speech and important component in the development of free speech doctrine.  <br />The book is a good read for those interested in free speech issues, the history of which are supremely important in understanding the nature and danger of threats to freedom.	2005-01-30

As part of Hitler's personal staff, especially for such a long time, Below's experiences were obviously unique and would be interesting to anyone interested in WWII or Hitler.  It present an insider's view of what was going on at Hitler's headquarters.  In many cases (he claimed) he was not in the know.  Below wrote that it was only later, after the war, that he found out the full extent of the atrocities.  This was probably true, as it was with many members of his personal staff, who lived isolated lives with Hitler, who never spoke directly about it.  Below does say, however, that he finds it inconceivable that Himmler would have exterminated Jews without Hitler's knowledge.

The excerpts by Porphyry are divided thematically and are accompanied by references to the biblical passages he was referring to.  Because almost no anti-Christian works survive from antiquity, this reconstruction is particularly valuable as an insight into how 'pagan' or non-Christian philosophers may have viewed Christianity.  Porphyry was obviously familiar with Christian teaching and scriptures, and composed a sophisticated refutation of its doctrine.  There were clearly many who were deeply familiar with Christian doctrine and did not reject it out of ignorance.  This book would primarily be important for studies on early Christianity, the persecutions and the religion's spread, as well as for philosophy.  Because this is one of the only extant philosophical sources that was directed against Christianity. the work is essential reading for Christian-'pagan' relations in the empire.  The epilogue to the book may provide a useful background for someone unfamiliar with the context.  The translation is good, and the book well-organized and easy to go through. Definitely recommended.	2005-01-26

It's a unique portrait of Hitler from 1932-1945 from the one of the only people who would have qualified as Hitler's friend.  The book is essentially the history of the Third Reich from Speer's perspective.  He was Hitler's architect, and later minister of armaments (1942-1945).  The subjects covered in this book are quite wide-ranging, including the National Socialist party, relations between Nazis (a lot of them hated one another), a lot on Hitler's personality, and the military campaigns and situation.  Not only was Speer in an excellent position to provide an insider's look at all these, but his book is one of the most intimate accounts of Hitler's personal life, to the point that one could only have an educated on Hitler after reading this book.  Many of the other memoirs from Hitler's staff or associates did not provide the personal perspective of Speer, whom Hitler had genuine affection for (rather than the working relationship he had with Himmler). One must of course, as with any book, bear in mind that it is presented from Speer's post-war perspective, however it's veracity is generally good.  One might want to read Dan Van der Vat or Joachim Fest's books on Speer for more of an analysis, or even better Gitta Sereny. Definitely worth the read!	2005-01-24

That is currently a huge issue in philosophy and relates to debate on the objectivity/subjectivity of moral claims.  There is much to Fish's argument but it might be better to study ethics and metaethics to get a better grasp of these issues.  However, Fish's claims certainly are thought-provoking and relevant.  He claims that there are no absolute moral concepts, which is a fair case to be made, and then applies it to free speech.  The difficulty is that, even if one's support of free speech is not based on some universal morality, that does not imply that there is no internally coherent concept of free speech.  Furthermore, Fish seems to argue solely for his own particular version of speech policy, to which he does not apply his own framework.  Although free speech may not be an 'absolute value' there are too many sophisticated arguments attempting to whittle away any pretense of it.  Even so, this book is definitely worth the read.	2005-01-23

He was apparently known to some as arrogant and unpleasant.  He was the only soldier in the German armed forces to receive the Knight's Cross with golden oakleaves swords and diamonds, and was by far the most successful dive bomber.  He destroyed, among other things, 519 tanks, over 1000 other vehicle, 70 landing craft etc.  He flew 2530 sorties, was shot down 32 times but never by an enemy aircraft and survived the war less a leg.  Many of his incredible exploits are in this book.  His story is good reading on the war and is a compelling story.

Sugden has been described as the best single comprehensive account of the Whitechapel murders, which is probably true.  Although Begg's 2004 \\"Jack the Ripper: The Facts\\" (for some reason available for now only at amazon.co.uk) in some ways equals or surpasses Sugden, Sugden is still crucial reading for anyone interested in the case.    He presents chapters on all canonical victims including (rightly I think) Martha Tabram.  He also suggests Millwood ought to be added to the list.  He provides details on several of the other murders, including Wilson, Coles and Mackenzie, and argues they were probably not Ripper victims.    His suspect chapters include Druit, Ostrog, Kosminski and Chapman.  One of best aspects of the book is Sugden's conservative approach to the evidence, which, unfortunately leaves much about the case up in the air.  He basically argues through the book that all the known suspects should be discounted, but if there is one who was in fact the Ripper, it was possibly Chapman. The good thing is that his minimal speculation allows him to discount a lot of nonsense, which, unfortunately pervades the subject.  He provides a wealth of detail on all aspects of the case and covers most of the major controversies, including the nature of Stride's injuries, Matthew Packer, the Lusk kidney, or the Coles and Mackenzie murders.  One of the gems Sugden includes is a rarely-cited Church Lane sighting on the night of the double event of a man probably fitting the description of the other witness reports.  In each case, he includes the various opinions on the issue and then evaluates the evidence himself.  On the whole, because of the nature of the evidence, Sugden remains skeptical, falling back into agnosticism with a minimum of speculation.  So, for an accurate presentation and analysis of most of the available evidence, this book (along with Begg) is a must read.	2005-01-23

But, as many of his associates would attest, he himself declared the book obsolete, irrelvant, poorly written and he regretted publishing it (which is why he never published his second book).  Most high ranking National Socialists never read it, with the exception of Goebbels.  The book probably has more emotional impact on people today than it did back then, and I personally don't understand how it's now become so significant to neo-nazis and censors.  The book would probably be more useful to historian types than to the general reader.  The prose is turgid and disorganized, and definitely seems to simply be rant put to paper (it's not simply the translation, the German edition is the same way).  The book is also difficult to read all the way through.  The chapter on propaganda is proably the most useful one, and is the only here where Hitler shows his brilliant understanding of persuasion.  Most of the book is still filled with his typical perorations with his pseudoscientific, somewhat simplistic understanding of things (although he probably read more than most people).  Despite his intelligence, most of this book is by no means a masterpiece, especially given many of his problematic beliefs.  For insight into Hitler's mind, his second book would be a better read, but even more important would be his 'secret conversations'.  It's definitely a worthwhile read for us serious students of history, just like the Communist Manifesto, but otherwise I would pass, as I think it's significance has been way overblown. I nonetheless gave it a five for it's significance as a historical text, but without that, I would have given it a 2 or a 1.	2005-01-23

For insight into Hitler's personality and thoughts, this is by very, very far the best book available.  The conversations were surreptitiously recorded by a notetaker during Hitler's conversation sessions with various visitors and his staff. Some entries are verbatim, while others are summaries of Hitler's comments.  Obviously Hitler said many things to many people, which means one has to be extra careful in determining what he really believed.  His thinking also changed over time, and, like most people, was not always consistent, which makes the task of understanding his thought all-the-more difficult.  But this book is by far the most useful source for any understanding of Hitler.  The comments were in private conversations, (Hitler usually did not know Bormann was having them recorded), and they are often unguarded ruminations.  Of course to those without a real interest in history, the book might seem long and tedious.  Hitler had a tendency to say brilliant things one minute, and then trail off into rantings about nonsense the next, so the book is not for everyone. Anyone interested in Hitler for any reason should read this book, and anyone who hasn't read it can't have much of value to say.	2005-01-23

Actually a book that emphasizes an unfortunately rarely heard word, \\"forgiveness\\".  As difficult as it may be, perhaps that is the ideal this civilized, advanced and cultured society ought to strive for.  It's too bad there are too few actual Christians left in the world who take a message and actually attempt to alter the way they do things.  With the media and society the way they are, people tend to emphasize paranoia and hatred when it comes to crimes, with almost no emphasis on compassion and forgiveness. Although forgiving is difficult, that forgiveness is not even held up as the ideal ought to make one question people's real motives and dispositions.  People seek the infliction of pain or death in the name of compassion for the victims, and somehow they pretend they are noble and serving justice.  The families one hears from in this book have not only suffered immensely, but have also done something more profound and difficult than most could imagine.  This book is a difficult read because of the subject matter, but many people could learn from it.  It is quite beyond me how the people in this book are not held up as ethical models for the rest of us, people who really believe in a principle everyone supposedly also believes (except when it's not convenient, then we like bloody vengeance). <br /> <br />\\"But I say to you who listen: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If anyone hits you on the cheek, offer the other also. And if anyone takes away your coat, don't hold back your shirt either.\\" \\"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.  If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.\\"  But I guess this just never applies.  So much for the 'advanced morality' and 'Christian ethic' so many talk about today.	2005-01-23

Her case is circumstantial at best.  The problematic mtDNA evidence and links to numerous JtR letters that are undoubtedly frauds and the fact that Sickert may have been in France in September 1888 are all problems that would have to be dealt with much more seriously.  I think it was a noble attempt, but her argument ultimately falls short.  While it's not totally worthless, it is definitely not \\"case closed\\".  One would be better served to read Begg's \\"JtR The Facts\\", or Sugden's \\"Complete History\\".  For suspect oriented books, Fido or Evans & Gainey are much more worthwhile.	2005-01-23

It is essentially a compilation of contemporary documents, mostly police, inquest and newspaper reports.  It covers the major bases, including the individual murders and some documents relating to suspects and police opinions.  Although it obviously may not be as comprehensive or up-to-date as one might like, it is one of the few primary source collections on the Whitechapel crimes, which alone makes it worth the read.	2005-01-23

Because of the depth of the subject, it would naturally be impossible to provide a comprehensive account in such a small book and, in many ways, what Lukacs provides is nothing new to someone familiar with the subject.  Also, unfortunately, it does not include discussion of Kershaw's recent monumental bio.  That being said, I found much of his take on Hitler interesting.  His discussion of Hitler being more of a nationalist than a racist, for example, is not particularly controversial, but it's nice to actually read a 'popular' history book that acknowledges the complexities involved in historical judgments.  Lukacs takes on specific aspects of Hitler's history that, I would assume, he found particularly interesting, such as the influence that Vienna and/or Munich had on Hitler, the nature of Hitler's statesmanship, and whether Hitler was a reactionary or revolutionary.  Although one might not agree with some of the point he makes, as no one is infallible, Lukacs' take on the historiography of Hitler is definitely a worthy read.	2005-01-22

Books	4	9	16	N	N	A good introduction	This book as an investigation of the phenomenon of denial is well-researched and interesting.  In terms of its refutation of denial, it would probably make a decent introdution. The chapter on  basic epistemology in history likely indicats that the authors were aiming at non-specialist/historian audience. Although for the specialist, there are more sophisticated books and articles out there, so in that sense, the arguments might seem somewhat simplistic (which is why I would give it 4 sintead of 5). I think one of the possible reasons this book was written was to make clear that the 'skeptic' mindset does not lend itself to skepticism about anything and everything, putting distance between skeptics of, for example, religious claims, and skeptics about the holocaust. I might also add that anything by Michael Shermer would definitely be recommended.	2005-01-22

Ellul's study still stands out as one of the greatest achievements in the history of the study of propaganda, in terms of how it is practiced, how/why it is effective and how it is inescapable and tied to the very nature of democratic society.  Ellul's picture is not a pretty one.  He views propaganda as ultimately dehumanizing, necessary and inevitable at the same time.  Propaganda, ANY propaganda, regardless of motives or veracity, serves to reduce the individual to function as a meaningless syphon. Whether one agrees with his conclusions or not, it is still a well-argued, compelling and frightening look and modern societies. <br /> <br />The biggest drawback is that the book published today is the same as that published in 1965  (Ellul died in 1994 and no real updated edition was ever produced), and the cases analyzed may seem obsolete, in that he focuses primarily on National Socialist, Maoist, Soviet and US cold war propaganda.  But the analysis of is still second to none. For those familiar with the study of propaganda, Ellul's work was by far the most comprehensive and penetrating study of propaganda to that point.  It was a HUGE and monumental advance from the previous research into propaganda of Bernays, Lambert, or Fraser. This book ought to be required reading for anyone who wishes to consider themselves even remotely literate or intelligent.  Although one may not agree with all his conclusions, it nonetheless provides a compelling argument and portrait of modern man and how frighteningly easy it is to systematically 'persuade' him.  Any thinking person cannot but attempt to be cognizant of how we are influenced. <br />This book is relevant for several reasons.  1) The student of history will appreciate the Ellul's examples. 2) The book analyzes what are, essentially, the beginnings of modern propaganda making it important for anyone studying the phenomenon. 3) Ellul breaks the phenomenon down into easily understood categories and places them in the context of the modern 'technological', urbanized society and what Ellul calls the predicament of modern man. 4) The research and sources that went into writing this book are as comprehensive as they could have been. 5) It provides an excellent explanation of much of 'modern life'. 6) Ellul was also an interesting writer and individual (simultaneously an Evangelist and Anarchist). <br /> <br /> <br />Again, the only real drawback is that some might find the examples obsolete and there are more recent studies of modern propaganda techniques, which have naturally advanced since from those used during the cold war. One would also be well served to read the more recent studies of propaganda by Chomsky, Cialdini (a more psychological approach), Jowett or Cunningham.  I would still give Ellul's book more than 5 stars if I could.	2005-01-22
