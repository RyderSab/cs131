First, before my review, I want to thank Mike Ruppert, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, Congressman Ron Paul, Greg Palast (BBC reporter), Former Congressman Bob Barr, Alex Jones, Sibel Edmonds, Michael Moore and other unsung heros who put their necks on the line for us all in the US on a daily basis, to fight the fight to keep our freedoms in place. <br /> <br />This book is an essential guide to understand what the hell is really going on that isn't mentioned on the \\"fair and balanced\\" Fox News Channel (here's a joke: we report, you decide). <br /> <br />Approached as a police investigation into drugs/Wallstreet, the CIA/Wallstreet, FBI, Al Qiada, Bush's Government Involvement into 9/11, peak oil, loss of the constitution, and a host of other little thieveries of the government at tax-payers expense.   <br /> <br />I warn you though, at times you can become depressed and very upset at what you read.  But this feeling will pass as you move toward activism.  All evidence is sited and documented.   Mike Ruppert describes the war on terror as really \\"the war on civil liberties.\\" With 50% of the bill of rights is gone, you could argue that we are 50% down the road to fascism.   <br /> <br />There are those who choose denial as a coping mechanism, but what we really need is more intelligent freedom warriors; people who actually call their representatives in congress daily, who write the publishing editors of newspapers, who tell other what is going on.   <br /> <br />Great Work! <br /> <br />\\"Long Live Freedom in America\\"	2004-10-16

I must say that after looking for books on BJJ for a while now, I am glad to see there are finally some really good ones out there. This book is probably one of the best out there.  As a martial arts instructor (kung fu), I must say that it is necessary these days to learn the entire game, and not just the parameters of your system - as good as I think kung fu is.  And why not, shouldn't the future martial artist be complete; to be able to defend him/herself on the gound as well as standing?...	2002-03-23

Still some good stuff	After highly anticipating this book, I must say that I was disappointed. After purchasing the book which suggested that it would reveal \\"Secret Teachings of Warrior Sages\\" I found out that Mr. Danaos can only share knowledge cryptically (his words). And unfortunately he does not do this well. The amount of actual practical methods taught in the book are condensed to 8 pages of basic Qigong/Chi Kung and meditation. If you are looking for how to achieve any levels in the Mo-Pai nei kung system, then you must actually find John Chang, or one of his disciples. Having said that, I must say that there are good points to the book.<br />Some of the theory was interesting if you could sift through the esoterica and historical presentations. I do think that Mr. Danaos knows his stuff, but I feel that he is either unwilling or unable (prior secrecy agreements) to share what he has learned. I liked Mr Danaos' first book so much that I really wanted to give this one a good review, but I cannot. Still may be worth purchasing for your library. I think it is.<br />3 Stars...	2002-03-23

And truly investigate it. There is enough evidence now to conclude that S.I.D.S., asthma, autism, ADD, ADHD, epilepsy and Epstein Barr are linked to childhood vaccinations. <br />A vaccine in and of itself is a great thing, however, it is the addition of toxic heavy metals, and other ingredients used to attenuate a microbe that make it deadly. ... <br />When a child is born, it is born without myelin (a fatty protective coating) attached to the nervous system. When we introduce these toxic substances to a baby's unprotected nervous system we are gambling. Gambling that the child will not react violently to the stressor. Many of these affects are not reported, those that are, are labeled, \\"underlying brain conditions.\\" Now I have been reading that the CDC is now working on a vaccine that has 95-100 different vaccines in one shot. The issue today Look out, Be careful, Investigate first, then decide.<br />The arguement here is; either you are considered a freeloader (herd immunity - protected in a population by those vaccinated) by protecting your right to good health, or you are a conformist. The conformists believe in the vaccine and its health benefits, and those that question suppositions are considered the \\"outcasts\\" - or the ones who \\"are not part of the team.\\" The CDC is now using the September 11 attacks to mandate small pox vaccine.<br />As for the book, I think despite other criticisms that the author is very knowledgable about the issues and presents a good case for not vaccinating. Harris presents parents who have had children who have been damaged by - what he believes -are the vaccinations. Harris suggests that previosly mentioned \\"non-reported\\" effects of vaccinations are creating socially handcapped people. Harris Coulter has my respect for service in 2 presidential cabinets as an interpreter, and for investigating this topic and taking a stand. Well written. <br />5 Stars!<br />...	2002-03-03

The story begins with a plot by the Commerce Guild and a certain senator to have Ancion (a planet in the Republic) leave the Republic, which in turn would cause other favorable events to happen.  Anakin, Obiwan, Baris and another Jedi interceed to try and save the union. That is as basic as I can get it without giving too much. <br />I think the book (audio CD) was done well with some exceptions. Although I did enjoy the story I felt that there just wasn't enough in the way of the breakdown of the Republic. Although there were some good jedi battles and the overall description and sounds on the the CD were great.  I did enjoy this story, but it just wasn't a grabber. <br />If you are looking for advanced stuff for the Episode 2 movie, you will be disappointed, there isn't much.  Still a good story and worth the 4 stars.	2002-02-22

Ed.)(CAM) by Cheng Xinnong.  I would also like to recommend - but not required - Foundations in Chinese Acupuncture (Rev. Ed.) by Ellis, Wiseman and Boss.  This book is great for channel theory and has excellent detail throughout.   <br />For Everyone else:<BR>The above also applies to everyone else but mostly to TCM students.  In review of Giovanni's book I must say that from a Western Medical science point of view it was easier to understand than \\"The Web\\" and I found that it presented the material in a logical systematic fashion with better and more complete explanations.  It is better to start with this book, than with some of the others because once you have a good background with this one, you can understand the different wording in the other books (CAM, Web, etc.).

I also found that it is very comprehensive also.  Some of the other titles I've read on the subject (Lippincott, Harper's) did not go into the detail of this one.  Another positive note is that this is a clinical book also; giving you case studies in each chapter to test your knowledge.

I found that this book gives a very thorough and systematic overview of Qi Gong theory and history. I enjoyed the clear format and overview of history.  However, I felt that the book could have brought together more of some of the other Qi Gong methods, from Taoists, Buddhist, and family styles.  Not a very practical book, but more of a theory book.  Dr. Yang focused a lot on Boddidarma's (Ta Mo, Da Mo) original classics (Muscle Tendon Changing and Brain/Marrow Washing), and less on other styles. I would have enjoyed other systems and methods mentioned. <br />Still very detailed and a very essential book for foundational information.<br />41/2 Stars	2001-10-19

The Brain and Behavior is a book that looks at the neuro-anatomical structures of the brain, and explains what will ahppen to mood and behavior when these areas are affected.  The author goes into some pathologies such as schizophrenia and shows example how the cerebelar vermis can be involved and even the cause of this disorder (support for chiropractic adjustments, i.e. reducing dysafferentation). <br />At a seminar I learned of Cerebellar Syndrome - an anxiety disorder - which is totally supported by this book (Quote: &quot;structural abnormalities of the cerebellar vermis has been seen in depression&quot;).  <br />Also, there was even support for the arguement against MSG and Aspartame in food:<br />          &quot;Glutamate and aspartate are excitatory, and neurons in the CNS [(Central Nervous System)] contain receptors to one or the other.  Normally, only small quantities of these excitatory amino acids appear in the synapse at any one time.  [here's the good part] If extraneural concentrations of these excitatory amino acids exceed the ability to uptake machanisms to remove them [which is what happens when you eat anything with: <br />MSG, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, Hydrolyzed protein, hydrolyzed plant protein, plant protein extract, sodium caseinate, calcium caseinate, yeast extract, textured protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolzed oat flour, malt, malt extract, malt flavoring, bouillon, stock, flavoring, natural flavoring, and seasoning], <br />[then] the affected neuron will die.  This process of neuron cell death is referred to as excitotoxicity and is an important mechanism of neuron loss following hypoxia [(lack of oxygen)] and ishemia [(low oxygen)]. Excitotoxicity has been implicated in schizophrenia (see Coyle and Puttfarcken, 1993).....and may be involved in both the establishment and maintenance of addictive behavior (Kalivas, et al, 1998)&quot;<br />This statment on page 24 is significant in the arguement against the use of flavor enhancers in food.  In effect, you are programming your neurons to die when you eat food with excitotoxins because extra neurotransmitters give the message that neurons use for programmed cell death. If your child or you are suffering from additive or poor behavior or bad test scores, then this book is for you.  Having written the above, I want to say that there is still more to this great book.  So do yourself a favor and pick it up.  A little too technical for the layman, but you can follow along with a medical dictionary if necessary.  Excellent for the health professional concerned more with the function of the body, versus, pathology (the way it should be).<br />GREAT BOOK - 5 STARS!!!	2001-10-19

And I felt let down. <br />The plot takes place after Episode I, but before Episode II; when Anakin begins to grow up and have rebellious feeling and, although in Coruscant; he still enjoys Pod Racing. He get mixed up with the wrong crowd and ObiWan must save him.  Then the story turns to the rapidly developing Empire, and a new kind of starship that is alive that the Empire wants.  Anyway, I don't want to give away too much, but I felt there was way to much description and to little good plot and exciting details.  Jedi battles are also very scarce.	2001-10-19

The book does indeed review Part III is great detail, but the part four review - with the exception some medical stuff, abdominal exam, thorax, etc. and some others, does not fully prepare you for Part IV.  I found the last section on technique extremely lacking,  there were no pictures, and very little on the method with which National Boards test you on (vertebral malposition listings [national listings]) since most of us were taught Gonstead (at least at Life West). <br />In conclusion, I recommend the Irene Gold review seminars.  They may help more than this book will. It is a great book, but let's be real here, with the expense of Part IV National Boards ($850), it is cheaper not to buy this book and go to a review and get a passing grade, than to save in the beginning and fail the exam.  That's the opinion of someone who used this book and studied in detail and failed the first time around.<br />4 Stars!	2001-10-19

The author Diane Dreher tells the reader how they should apply the Tao (Tao Te Ching) to their everyday lives, and provides little exercises for how to accomplish this.

Personally, I don't like to give bad reviews to any author, and the book was not that bad, it just wasn't written in an interesting way.

I can't say for certain that I can believe the fantastic claims made in this book, but I can say it was very interesting, especially if it is true.  <br />I know for a fact that most human beings can develop internal power with long hard work, but even the great Sun Lu Tang did not achieve the level of power as John Chang; being able to ignite newspaper by touch. If the depictions in this book are all true and the next book describes how to do them, then we all will have to take our awareness and training up a notch. Just think, we won't need knives anymore to cut vegetables for our salad, we could use our fingers. just kidding!<br />All and all, a great book and well written.

If you are into learning about how molecules of the stomach (neurotransmitters), are the same as those in the central nervous system, and therefore, think, then this book is for you.  If you are interested in learning how interacions with other people affect our health this book is for you. This book is about understanding the relationship of the mind/body not as 2 entities, but as 1.<br />One of the previous reviewers says &quot;bad physics&quot;, I do not believe this to be so.  If you look into the work of Karl Pribram of Yale University where people in accidents had portions of their brains removed for medical reasons, and who never suffered a loss of specific memory (Holographic Universe, 1991).<br />I am not truely convinced in the efficacy of chemotherapy as Dr. Chopra is, so for this reason and the fact that chemotherapy does not really have a place in this book, I cannot give 5 stars. Chemotherapy kills many people and saves few.  There are much better cancer treatments then the 3 billion dollar a year chemotherapy treatment, many of them cost nothing.  <br />Anyway you slice it, this book is still an eye opener to those who seek knowledge about the delicate interrelationships between ourselves and all things.<br />Very Good Book! 4 Stars!	2000-12-19

Being a practitioner of the neiji, I  find Bruce Kumar's explanations clear, articulate and interesting; there is  no holding back of knowledge.  However, there was a tendency to brag a  little, but I do not fault him on that since he spent too many years  studying with so many teachers.  I respect this man and his writing.  I  recommend this book highly.<br />5 - Stars!	2000-09-14

This book is very convenient because in just fits in your back pocket.  It  serves as a guide for food additives found in almost all food.  I liked the  convenience of this book, as I was able to slip it into the back pocket and  refer to it as I shopped.  Although I enjoyed the book, it is very basic,  generally publishing most info from the FDA guidelines on food safety.  The  only problem with that is that the FDA leans towards the &quot;everything  is safe [fit for consumption] until it is absolutely proven to be  harmful&quot; philosophy (GRAS); instead of, &quot;it is unsafe [unfit for  consumption] until it is absolutely proven safe.  This philosophy benefits  the food industry and not the individual consumer.  <br />Why does the  congressional Food Protection Committee receive funding from the food  industry and still claim that they are looking out for your best interest?   Dr. George Schwartz who found a pamphlet published by the FDA on the safety  &quot;facts&quot; on MSG had in fact been compiled and published by The  Glutamate Association (Blaylock, Excitotoxins.  1997. Health Press).<br />With  these kinds of inconsistencies we all must become aware consumers of food,  water and other products, because money is the issue, not safety.   <br />This  book is a great start, but I would suggest further reading to get a better  idea of what is in our food.  <br />A Solid Book!  Great Info!  5 - stars	2000-09-14

I found this book  interesting and scary at the same time.  If what this author is saying is  true, then we all need to be much more careful in what we eat and buy.   There is just too much at stake.  Especially when the FDA, the food  industry lobby, and pharmaceutical companies are gunning for you and your  family. Be a detective and find out for yourself.  If you find a  questionable claim, look it up on medline - a good source for current  studies.<br />Although I liked this book, I found it just a little fantastic,  and felt angry and upset at the politics of food. Still a decent book  though.<br />TIP: stay away from excitotoxins, supplement, see a chiropracor  regularly, exercise and eat only organic foods.  **Disclaimer- That was  just an opinion, not medical advise.<br />&quot;If first an idea is not  absurd, it has not hope for survival.&quot; -Albert Einstein	2000-08-19

A must for all who practice nei gung	Before I bought this book I was thinking that Hsing I is already internal  and I didn't need anything more in my practice. After being refered to this  book, I bought it anyway and am glad I did. In this book you'll find some  great history on Hsing I Ch'uan and some great internal sets. I find myself  feeling very gracious that much of this material was almost lost and now it  is available in the U.S.. We always have to be thankful when more is  published on these great systems of Chinese martial arts (Hsing I, Bagua,  Tai Ch'i).  <br />I recommend it highly!	2000-08-19

I had  a test a school but instead of studying, I read this book. Shocking!!!!  <br />A compelling book that portrays the gauntlet of bureaucracy that Dr.  JoAnn Burkholder had to ordeal when she discovered something in the waters  off of the Eastern Seaboard.  The leaders of N.C.'s  DEM, and the DEHNR  showed their obvious distaste for her and her work when this information  proved to be threatening &quot;the machine&quot; of business as  usual.<br />What's most shocking about the whole things is 1. The lengths that  the health department officials will go to cover this up, and truly not  deal with an obvious health crisis; and 2. THIS IS A TRUE STORY that is  still unfolding today off the East Coast. <br />Well written and with courage.   5 - stars!<br />&quot;Get into the fight before it's too late&quot;	2000-08-10

Excellent Read!   A Must for Every Nutritionist	I just got finished reading this book in between classes, and all I can say is WOW!  Be aware, and beware of your tap water.  If these statistics are correct, then the EPA and the U.S. government are not concerned with  protecting your right to clean water, and therefore, you must educate  yourself in order to protect against degenerative disease. <br />[ 1991-1992  EPA records showed that the nations water systems   committed over 250,000  violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act, affecting more than 100 million  Americans - and 10% of those exceeded the MCL (Max Contaminant Level) of  the EPA. ] <br />This book is a great start finding out the truth of the  matter. Toxins are everywhere!  We all need to learn where they exist and  remove them for our own and our childrens sake.  <br />Someday, a high ranking  official on TV may review this book, or a similar subject and try and spin  these numbers a certain way to make it not sound so bad, but don't be  fooled.  Statistics seldom lie.  Only politicians do.  Politicians can come  from any field, not just government.  Politicians come from industry,  medicine, lobby, and big business etc.  Be a detective, and look for  anything that doesn't make sense. <br />&quot;The Truth is Obvious, Everything  Else is Questionable&quot;	2000-07-24

Dr. Blaylock, in his book reviews countless studies that prove the dangers of excitotoxins. The powerful food industry and others are implicated in trying to cover up this truth. <br />I have read this book and am very  grateful that an M.D. went against the grain and helped a nation understand  the truth.  The truth that excitotoxins are dangerous, they kill neurons   and are in practically everything.  <br />In science today there exists  ubiquitous politics. Those who fund studies wish a certain outcome, and  usually get it with the help of exclusionary interpretation.  If science is  the study of truth through empirical studies, and political power covers  this truth, then today's science is largely a matter of power and politics,  and not truth.  This is how the large part of society is deceived.  This is  the case with the FDA's widespread approval of aspartame (and  aspartate/aspartic acid for that matter).<br />Because of their widespread use  and acceptance in America; it begs the question, what's the agenda here?   If you wanted to dumb down (make docile) a large population of people how  would you do it? <br />&quot;The truth is obvious, everything else is  questionable&quot;	2000-07-17

It is easy enough for laymen as well as the professional. I got a hold of this book after training in Applied Kinesiology (AK). After a long hard look it appears that this book is the only Clinical Kinesiology book in print. All others appear to be out of print. I would enjoy more published work based on the late Alan Beardall, D.C.. Also, I'd like to comment on the great section in the book on sub-clinical Candidiasis.<BR>Truely a great book (especially for the cost).	2000-05-26
US	52494001	R3CLACEMPNUNIU	0609803662	506084503	A Consumer's Dictionary of Food Additives: Fifth Edition Over 140,000 Copies Sold	Books	2	10	13	N	N	A Decent book, but by no means the food additive bible.	I bought this book as a chiropractic student to learn more about food additives.  As a nutritionist it is important to learn what goes in as well as what to avoid.  While researching excitotoxins in food, I found that  according to Ruth Winter in her book Aspartate was considered a safe  additive.  Most people are aware of the dangers of Aspartame (an  excitotoxin that destroys  brain hypothalamus tissue, as well as becoming  formaldehyde in the liver) and glutamate - but Aspartate being a  non-essential amino acid has not been associated with the other  exitotoxins.  Well Aspartate (Aspartic acid without the H+, and 1 methyl  group away from being identicle to glutamate) according to Dr. Russell  Blaylock, MD in the book, &quot;Excitotoxins - the Taste That Kills&quot;  kills neurons in the brain as well as damage muscle tissue. This particular  amino acid overexcites muscle and brain tissue to the point of destruction.   As was taught at a basic biochemistry class in chiropractic college -  anything substance that can serve as a neurotransmitter, can become an  excitotoxin because it increases the amount of neurotransmitter in the  brain and periphery. Histlogic samples show marked destruction in the  hypothalamus of mice (illustrated in book).  If you look on Pubmed for  current studies, they are there in abundance.  Based on the information I  retrieved from Ruth Winter's book, it appears to be in conflict with many  other nutrition sources that I respect. For me to accept this book as the  authority, it would need to drop the dietitian flavor, and review the  literature concerning excitotoxins.  As for the rest of the book and other  additives, I cannot comment.  I understand that many hard hours went into  this book so I won't totally bad mouth it, but the only one time I needed  it as a reference it failed me.	2000-05-18
