She writes with humor and love about her travels, her heritage and her experiences.  She was trying to get home from Ireland to visit her family in Kentucky on 9/11/01 when she discovered that she was the only traveler on the plane without a partner to share the uncertainty, fear, and horror of the event that would reshape the way we all view our place in the world today. She never lost her sense of humor or took herself too seriously as she coped with each new challenge.  Irish Reflections is a good read and a comforting reminder that there is always reason to hope, learn and grow.	2005-07-09

The answer to the crime that everyone thinks is solved actually lies in a book that one of the main characters has written.  The ending is a surprise and getting there is half the fun in reading the book.  It's a great read.<br />Ashley Spencer is 17 when an intruder kills her best friend and her father as he plans to come back from a snack in her kitchen to kill her.  As the story unfolds, a suspect is apprehended, excapes, and someone tries to kill Ashley again.  Her mother and the dean of her private school are killed in following chapters.  <br />Througout the book when the killer seems to be known to all, something is not quite right.  It's a good read when you think you know the answers, suspect you do not, and finally find out that you were totally off base.	2004-05-01

He's an orphan who got through school on scholarships against all odds.  His first real love is brutally murdered and at the beginning of the story he is trying to find his way after being suspected of having killed her.  A mystery doctor on staff at his hospital, Dr. Arthur Chess, drops into his life along with mysterious tips or clues leading him to look for Jocelyn's killer.  The story is slow and hard to follow.  The suspense finally picks up about half way through the book, and it's worth finishing.<br />Now that we have met Dr. Carrier, perhaps his next adventure will be a little more suspenseful and intense.	2004-01-22

It's a story of power and betrayal and using people who believe in their mission to betray that mission.

He knows enough about the frightening events that take place on airplanes or makes up enough new ones to scare a timid soul into taking the bus.  <br />In Turbulence, the setting is post 9/11 and Meridian Airlines is dealing with internal problems.  Meridian is a mirror image of any airline that flying passengers have been on with poor service, too little space, lack of good information, and passengers traveling with personal problems.  Add to the mix a captain who had been a good domestic pilot of super big airplanes<BR>who had bid on an international flight route and was not given enough training on the differences of international and domestic flight.  The pilot was insecure and working on an ulcer; the copilot was hostile towards him and trying not to worry about his own problems at home.  The lead flight attendant was hostile and hated the passengers she was supposed to be serving.  <br />Several passengers with problems of their own had experienced problems with Meridian before takeoff to South Africa.  The delay is long and uncomfortable with no acceptable explanation.<BR>During the flight the pilot mistakes a mechanical signal for an engine fire and lands in the middle of a civil war in Nigeria.  <br />With no confidence in the pilot, the passengers revolt in a rage, the lead flight atttendant hides in the cockpit, and the plane moving through the skies becomes a threat to the controllers on the ground who have no idea what is actually going on inside the plane.  <br />The suspense is almost unbearable.

Deception Point was the best of three wonderful reads.  In Deception Point the action is set in a current presidental election with the usual list of unsavory political characters and general maneuvering.  The plot makes this book the most suspenseful one I have read in a long time.  NASA is reporting a new discovery that offers proof that life exists on other planets.  The story line has been reviewed several times already so I will just add that the suspense was nearly unbearable and the ending lived up to this reader's expectations with a surprise villian and wonderful end to the greedy senator who would be president at any and all costs.

Dan Brown's research and imagination make for truly suspenseful can't-put-them down books.  <br />The Illuminati, a secret society dating back to the time of Galileo is believed to have died out until Leonardo Vetra is found murdered and branded with the sign of the Illuminati on his chest.  The Director of the Cern Institute that employed Vetra and his daughter Vittoria, summons Robert Langdon to try to explain how Vetra could have been murdered and how his discovery of anti-matter could have been stollen.  The story moves to Rome where the pope has died and a conclave to elect a new pope is about to begin.  It appears that terrorists have planted the anti-matter beneath the Vatican and will destroy the city when the timer on the apparatus runs out.  There seems to be no solution as Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra together race through Rome looking for clues to the whereabouts of the canister.  The ending is a surprise and the suspense is tight to the last page.	2003-08-30

The kids had wings and could fly.  In \\"The Lake House\\" the same kids are back involved in a tedious custody battle between their natural parents whom they had never known and the Veterinarian who had helped, along with Kit Brennan the FBI agent, to rescue them.  The story is basically strange kids growing up and silly.<br />The Alex Cross books written by Mr. Patterson were his best literary efforts.  When the Wind Blows sold a lot of books so on came the sequel.  The result was a watered down version of a once successful book.  It would be great to see the original suspense of the Cross series come back.	2003-08-30

At the first media presentation a woman in the area sees Callie on TV and recognizes physical characteristics that lead her to believe that Callie is her daughter Jessica.  <br />Jessica was kidnapped when she was three years old as her brother Douglas waited to see Santa.  The tragedy tore apart Suzanne Cullen's life, her family and her relationship with her son Doug who had been 3 years old at the time of the kidnapping.  <br />Solving the mystery of who Callie/Jessica's parents really are, and how it all came to be makes for a story with escalating suspense.  Nora Roberts has so many successful stories under belt that it's hard to say which one is best; Birthright is probably very near the top of the list.	2003-08-19

Usually though we hear more about Alex and his crime solving than about Milo.  In the Murder Book we get more character developoment on Milo who is super educated, gay, and a loner in the L. A. police department.  It's no secret that Alex and Milo have worked together on other cases and are long time friends.  <br />Dr. Delaware receives a \\"Murder Book\\" which is actually an album of crime scene police photos of many different murders.  There is no note and no apparent reason for the book to have been delivered to Alex.  After a quick look through the book Alex calls Milo and together they discover that one of the murders is an old unsolved case that Milo worked when he was a young cop.  His partner at the time was hostile and unwilling to provide any real mentoring as they worked together.  Now years later, Milo learns that the partner had a grudging respect for him, and was himself corrupt and on drugs.<br />Alex and Milo began investigating the years-old cold case and discover layers of coverups.  Throughout the book Alex laments the fact that Robin, his long time girl friend has finally left him.  He becomes involved in a new relationship that lacks the intensity that he had in previous books with Robin.  For a psychologist and an analytic guy, Alex is pretty inept in his dealings with women he cares abut.  <br />The Murder Book is really Milo's story and the suspense unfolds as he reopens the case without much backup and a lot of interference in the department.  It's a good read.	2003-06-09

Reacher continues to be the bigger than life hero who appears out of nowhere in his never ending travels, and heads off onto a new highway leading to a new adventure at the end of each breath taking suspense filled story.  Persuader, the seventh book in the series, is the best yet.<br />Jack Reacher is ex-military, commited to right as he sees it and always a defender of the wronged.  He has no address, no luggage, and always manages to find a change of clothes when necessary.  He can fight, swim, shoot, use a knife, and generally defend himself any way he needs to at the time. He can break a bad guy's neck and walk on to the next room without looking back.  <br />In Persuader, the reader is brought right into the middle of a kidnapping attempt that ends up with Jack Reacher (who else) rescuing the kid being kidnapped and inadvertently killing a cop.  Killing a cop seems like a bit much even for Reacher to cope with, but the story soon evolves and we quickly realize that the kidnapping was a staged senario designed to get Reacher on the inside with an organized crime family...not the usual organized crime, however, and the suspense continues to escalate throughout the book. <br />The Persuader is thrilling, suspenseful and a book that can't be put down without a lot of reluctance until the last page is read.	2003-06-09

When his grandfather suggests he get into therapy, Tom turns to Kelda for a recommendation and she leads him to Alan Gregory.  The suspense picks up as Kelda starts to become involved with Tom, and the police seem to be pursuing Tom all over again.  <br />Did Tom kill Ivy, and if not, who did kill her.  How did Kelda come into the evidence that supposedly cleared Tom?  These are questions that Dr. Gregory ends up in the middle of with information that Sam Purdy needs in order to prevent another death. The ending is a surprise and worth waiting for.  It's another good Stephen White Book to enjoy.	2003-03-17

The Other Side of Me is a little slow starting but still intriguing.  The family is dysfunctional.  The daughter with chopped off blonde hair died black is rebelling from a severely abusive and alcoholic mother.  The father is a scientist who seems at first look to be the glue that holds the family together.  Guess again, as the family begins to come unglued the story picks up as we find out that the good looking atheletic father who is a respected scientist happens to have a lover on the side.  That seems understandable until we figure out that the daughter had a twin sister who was abducted when the girls were babies, and that he was in the back of the van with the lover when the one twin was abducted.  The father has a secret life filled with well deserved guilt; the mother is trying to pull her life together; and the daughter is trying to understand why she feels so incomplete.  Searching for &quot;the other side of me&quot; is the reason for the plot and the suspense moves towards a surprise climax with a somewhat lackluster finish. I liked the writing, however, and will look for the next book from Mr. Kinsley.	2003-01-30

Wilson Cox and James Peters are unlikely partners.  Cox who walks on the wrong side of most ethical lines disappears and finally \\"shows up\\" dead.  Peters who pictures himself as a good guy seems to have all the bad stuff in life dumped on him.  His wife loves him, but has left him; his partner depended on him but has embezzeled funds from the partnership, his mother probably played around leaving his parentage in question and his mentor or possibly natural father is a bookmaker.  Incidental characters come and go are are faily easily killed off.  His romantic interest is a shallow newswoman who wants the scoop at all costs.  Who killed Wilson Cox is the big question throughout the story, but there was little intensity in the search.    I am glad I finished the book, however, because the ending made up for many mundane details in the body of the book.	2002-09-22

Father is actually a miserable but fairly predictable pervert who preys on the lonely and disenfranchised.  The story opens with a shootout in a cabin in Massachusetts where members of the cult are holed up and the FBI is trying to talk them out.  The leader passes out sucicide pills, and all but one of the six die.  One FBI agent is fatally wounded.<br />FBI Special Agent Maggie O'Dell is assigned to the case and as she begins her investigation, two murdered girls are discovered that seem to be linked somehow to Everett's church which is recruiting new members daily.  As the story unfolds it is easy to assume that Everett is somehow behind the murders.  Most of the characters, in the story, however have deep secrets or ghosts that they are battling including Agent O'Dell.  Maggie's mother turns up a member of the cult and in danger.  Maggie and her mother have had a difficult relationship since the death of Maggie's father. With each murder there is a rally being held.  There are surprises as each character finally ties in to a relationship with members of the cult.<br />We first met O'Dell in A Perfect Evil when she solved a case, and met Nick Morelli.  She is a likable character with a lot of baggage including a controlling soon-to-be ex-husband and a past with Morelli that she can't come to grips with.  O'Dell and Morelli worked well together.  Hopefully in books to come they will get back together.  The Soul Catcher is a good read.	2002-08-24

Froelich locates Jack Reacher and the story takes off with the suspense as compeling as the previous Jack Reacher books.  Jack, as usual, arrives on the job without a change of clothes, but this time he has his dead brother's old clothes to choose from as he begins a working relationship with Froelich that quickly turns into a personal one.  The clothes selection lasts about as long as it take Reacher to solve the case.  He calls in an old colleague from his military days who just happens to be available to consult on the case.  It's farfetched; but it works and the book is a great read.  Hopefully Reacher will continue wandering around the United States solving problems and being the central point of books to come.	2002-06-05

This is a fun book with people getting murdered every few days for no apparant reason, a cop that doesn't have much personality at first sight, but is to die for by the middle of the book. The heroine, Sarah Stevens is the best butler money can buy having had all the required butler training, AND being an expert in martial arts as well as a crack shot.  AND she looks good.  There is a catch though.  Her employers are getting killed.  The killer is actually stalking Sarah and has his own evil plans for her future.  Natually Sara and the cop get together for some great times that stretch the imagination a bit but are great for a fantasy read.	2002-05-04

Eureka was such a different type of story that it came as a surprise and did not hold my interest as intently as Diehl's earlier books did.  The poor cop was a little too much a boy scout type and the love interest was so out of his league that it was distracting to the story as well as totally unrealistically written.  I finished Eureka; it was an ok read for me but I am not looking to return to it as quickly as other readers seem to be wanting to do.	2002-04-24

The one who wrote A Time to Kill and some of the other good books that followed.  In The Summons, two brothers, one good and one bad, (of course) are \\"summoned\\" home to Mississippi at the request of their father who is a great judge and terrific philanthropist but (guess what) a really lousy father.  The good brother, Ray Atlee, arrives to find his father dead with his body in front of several barely hidden boxes containing three million dollars.  This could have been a suspensful story as Ray quickly hides (again) before the bad brother gets home in order to \\"save him\\" from the problems the money would cause him.  Ray runs around with the money in his car throughout the rest of the book all the while getting mysterious notes.  At the end of the book there is a mild surprise that doesn't really work because it only serves to set the reader up for a sequel....after the bad brother gets out of rehab we will get the rest of the story....<br />The Good Summons got 2 stars because I did read it through to the end having continued to hope that it would somehow get better.

Dr. Alan Gregory, a Boulder psychologist and old friend from previous books, continues to protect his patient confidentiality as he tries to help them.  Warning Signs is filled with coincidences.  Boulder's controversial Distric Attorney is found dead in his home while his semi-invalid wife is sleeping upstairs.  After the initial investigation is conducted by Pam Purdy and Lucy Tanner, also old friends from the serial, Lucy's fingerprints show up throughout the house an the police believe that she had been there prior to the murder making her a suspect.  In the meantime, Dr. Gregory has accepted a new patient who is concerned that her son may be involved with a plot to seek revenge on the people who raped his sister and caused his father to be convicted of assulting her rapist.  Her obsession is with the parents of the Columbine shooters...the Harrises and the Klebolds.  Should they have known what their sons were up to and should they have reported them.  <br />Warning Signs is a book that looks like an easy trip to an arrest, but there are so many different plots to be investigated along the way, that the end is a complete surprise.  As the story moves from a single isolated murder to a series of violent events the suspense builds.  Read the book !	2002-03-13

There is a date and a time, but no other information in the e-mail.  When Brenner shows up to talk to his old boss he is told that the army is investigation a 30-year old murder.  There is a big catch.  They don't know who was killed or who was the murder and they want Brenner to return to Vietnam and investigate.  What they do know is that there was a witness to the crime in which a US army lieutenant shot a US army sergeant in cold blood.  Brenner's assignment is to return to Vietnam and go \\"upcountry\\" to find the witness if indeed he is still alive to see if he has evidence.<br />There is a mystery, there is a girl of course, and no one is what they seem to be.  The suspense is good and the risks are great, but what I really liked about Upcountry was the sensitivity that Demille showed in writing about the inhumanity of war from both sides.  Brenner and Susan Weber make a harrowing trip against unbelievable odds and encounter veterans from North and South Vietnam all with different stories to tell and sometimes about the same battles.  The boys that went to Vietnam and returned as changed men, if they returned, should have received better treatment than our country gave them at the time.  Hopefully this book will add to understanding a long misunderstood war.  It's hard to tell where the fiction begins and reality ends.	2002-03-06

For all the readers who like their old friends back in stories, The Oath is a must read.  Abe Glistky, the homicide cop, and Dismas Hardy, the one time DA who is now a defense lawyer begin by talking about hit and run homicides not being murder.  A moving vehicle is just not a good murder weapon.  Tim Markham, the CEO of an HMO in trouble, is hit by a hit and run driver with injuries so severe that no one thinks he will survive. The cause of his death in the intensive care unit of his own hospital appears to be fairly obvious until it comes to light that the death rate is unsually high.  <br />Eric Kensing, Markham's attending physician, is the chief suspect when an autopsy reveals that Markham died of an overdose of Potassiam.  Kensing's wife had been involved with Markham; the head of the hospital had been intent on cutting costs at any price and everyone seemed unhappy with the care patients were receiving within the HMO.  Lescroart has taken a popular current topic and brought to light some of the shortcomings of managed health care.  He and Abe work the case from different angles but eventually get together with some suprises along the way.<br />It's medical ethics vs. cost intensive care and the frailities of human personalities from page to page.  It's a good read with Lescroart from start to finish....and there is a heartbreaker at the end with a final surprise.  <br />Oh yes, for Dismas Hardy fans, you will find that he is getting a little bored once again with Frannie and her needs, his kids and their needs, and still trying to figure out where his priorities should be.  The death of his first son is still tormenting him and he goes to visit the grave on the day of his son's 28th birthday.  The boy was a baby when we started reading the Dismas Hardy stories.  They are still good.<br />Who Killed Tim Markham is a questioned that gets answered finally at the very end of a page turner.	2002-02-24

She is now 26 herself and has matured into a timid woman who thinks she is unattractive and unliked by the people in her town.  These impressions have been fostered on her by her all too doting husband.  A couple of local girls disappear and it is feared that a serial killer is on the loose.  None of the people that Kattie's husband will &quot;allow&quot; her to associate with make her feel safe.  Along comes the boy from her childhood who is now a man who can still make her feel safe and protected even though the townpeople suspect him of being the killer.  Together they solve the mystery.

The patient, Lauren Teague, was a troubled teenager when Alex met her.  Her parents cared enough to try to get her into therapy, but their own relationship was strained.  Her therapy was abruptly terminated and Alex closed out her unpaid account.  Several years later, Alex sees Lauren at a stag party and is embarassed.  (Lots of bemoaning the male psyche and feeling bad about watching the strip show until he realizes he knows the entertainer)  Shortly afterwards Lauren is discovered dead in a dumpster.  As the story progresses people around Lauren begin dieing or disappearing.  An old campus murder is rehashed to see if there is a connection.  Two professors that Alex knew years ago knew Lauren.  Milo, Alex's old friend with the police is working the case, but Alex is the one who keeps following up leads that he thinks are relevant.  Alex is a one man team throughout much of the story and he's off in several directions at one time.  There are two many characters, two many murders for one story with no serial killer, and a lot of unnessary detail.<br />Enter a Hugh Hefner look alike character with the old guy about to die, a bimbo exwife living on the property, a daughter who is trying to run his empire and an unlikely son conducting some kind of psychological study.

FBI Agent Dillion Savich and his wife Sherlock work together trying to solve cases explain all the mysteries.<br />It begins with Dillion chasing down a serial killer named Tim (or Tammy)who has been kidnaping young boys and then luring them into circles painted on the floor so that the &quot;ghouls&quot; could <BR>have them.  Dillion actually senses the presence of the ghouls during the shootout.  Shortly afterwards his sister, Lucy, is in an automobile accident and is accused of trying to kill herself.<BR>Coincidentally, Lucy and Dillion both own extremely valuable paintings left to them by their grandmother.  Lucy's loving husband of several months is more interested in the paintings than he is in Lucy, and several of the paintings have disappeared having been replaced by quality forgeries.  At this point we hear about an eccentric collector who is probably trying to collect all of the existing original paintings.  <BR>Dillion eventually tracks down the one-armed Tim/Tammy, exposes the husband and the in-laws from hell, and retrieves the paintings.  What is never quite resolved is how the ghouls came to be or how they were eliminated.<br />Hemlock Bay is to be recommended if you don't require tidy endings and prefer a good escape &quot;read&quot; to an evening with tv and commercials.	2001-11-01

The characters were the politicians we met in Third Option and wanted to know &quot;the rest of the story&quot; about.  <BR>Congressman Rudin so self-righteous that he had no objectivity; Senator Hank Clark the ultimate corrupt politian, Dr. Irene Kennedy who had been prepared to take over the CIA when Thomas Stanfield died; President Hayes who had to go for broke in ordering the special forces along with Mitch Rapp to take on an ultra secret covert operation.  And, of course, Mitch Rapp, who saved the day, got back together with Anna, and hopefully will be back in another book soon. <br />In today's uncertain time  following the destruction of the World Trade Center and the search for Bin Laden, I would hope that Mitch Rapp's real world counterpart is out there along with a group of special forces about to find Bin Laden and destroy the Taliban's ability to create such horrendous destruction.	2001-10-17

It's a great adventure story.  It's too bad that the fiction was better than our real experience of loosing the World Trade Center towers.  <br />Cussler writing alone with Dirk Pitt back on centerstage makes for a continuing adventure saga, and in my opinion, a better story line than the books he co-authored featuring a younger hero.  For those of us who will never sail under the seas, Cussler brings the past and present together and sometimes he even prompts us to go back to the old historical stories that he uses to present his plots.

The satire sneaks up on the reader and brings on a chuckle or grimace with each page.  It is John Irving at his best.<br />Patrick Wallingford is a TV anchor and reporter for a second rate television station.  In his heart he would like to do good stories with responsible reporting, however he only gets sent out to do the sensational ratings boosting type of stories.  He also happens to be a fairly beneign sexual predator who seduces and sleeps with nearly every woman who crosses his path. His relationships have the depth of a puddle after a light rainstorm, and as the book begins, his wife is divorcing him because of his many affairs.  <br />The assignment that paves the way for The Fourth Hand is to cover a circus in India.  While Patrick is there a caged lion bites off his hand and the event is captured for all the world to see over and over again on television.  Meanwhile, a woman in Wisconsin, an avid Green Bay Packers fan, who desperately wants to have a baby with the husband she has always loved, decides that it would be lovely if her husband donated his arm so that Patrick can have a &quot;hand replacement.&quot;  Meanwhile, a strange and dedicated surgeon in Boston is waiting to perform the first hand transplant and join the list of medical greats. The beloved husband dies; the widow has sex with Patrick before signing over her husband's hand and then requests visiting rights for herself and the baby to come. <br />The story line covers much contemporary disallusionment, hope, insecurity, love, shallow emotion, intense ambition, and commitment all between the covers of The Fourth Hand.  I will never look at the 6:00 news anchors again without thinking of The Fourth Hand.	2001-09-29

Her husband is the No. 2 man in the publishing house having ingratiated himself with Maris' father and then having married Marris.

There is a relationship between the mysterious author and her husband Noah.  The plot of both &quot;books&quot; is beautifully crafted and a must read from cover to cover.	2001-09-15

He worked his way through law school and discoverd he was as bright as the best of them. Or so it seemed when he was hired by Reed, Briggs, a top notch law firm in Portland, Oregon. As the story begins Daniel is a struggling associate working too many hours and trying to please everyone. He allows himself to be conned into reviewing the discovery papers in a case involved in a possible product liability case. Arron Flynn, a plantiff attorney is suing Geller Pharmaceuticals for manufacturing a drug that allegedly causes birth defects. At the conference following Daniel's review of the papers a document surfaces that Daniel had missed entirely revealing that the company's research doctor had discovered that the drug did indeed cause severe defects. Daniel was quickly fired, and out of work, humilated, and scared about his financial future, he begins to investigate the drug company. People begin to die around him, and a several year old case of unsolved kidnappings surface. When the partner who fired him is killed, Daniel is accused of murdering him. Amanda Jaffe from &quot;Wild Justice&quot; is now a more seasoned criminal defense attorney who takes on his defense pro bono and works with Daniel's friend Kate to solve the case. The two women seem to do all the work while Daniel blunders along from murder to murder.<br />I will continue to wait for another blockbuster from Margolin, whose books I have enjoyed in the past.

She has given up a good programming job in the private sector to look for excitement with the FBI.  Until she can qualify for the training school for agents, however, she is stuck doing routine programming checks.  At the point the suspense picks up and never stops as Quinn Barry finds what she thinks is a glitch in the DNA matching program of the FBI.  There appears to be several murders with matching DNA sequences left behind at the scene of the crime.  Quinn alerts her boss to her finding and is suddenly reassigned to a lesser role than she originally had.  She starts investigating on her own with no backup and stumbles into a coverup that has allowed a serial killer to operate openly for many years.  <br />Quinn takes on impossible odds and somehow pulls off a successful conclusion to the mystery.

Colonel Wildman was a military investigator who had discovered a cover-up involving safety certifications on the G-626, one of the most popular civilian aircrafts flying today.  The evidence she had accumulated would have crippled a proposed merger between Boeing and Global, the manufacturer of the G-626.  <br />The detective assigned to the case is Simon Santos with a mystery past and a lot of money of his own.  His own personal wealth and philosophy enable him to cut a few corners in his investigations.  He brings in Martin Collins (Marty) who is a retired Air Force investigator who consults on military related homicides.  Martin is still recovering from the death of his wife and trying to cope with a young teenage daughter.  He sees the law, the crimes, the cover ups and the investigations in black and white and supposes that they will solve the mystery, expose the coverups and right all the wrongs.  <br />The character development adds to the suspense which builds and continues to the final pages of the book.  If there is a flaw, it's that there are too many characters to follow.  Altogether a good read, however.	2001-08-09

In Echo Burning he has drifted into Lubbock, Texas where it is hotter than seemingly any other place on earth.  As the story opens he has just had the misfortune to beat up a red-neck cop who bothered him in a bar.  He exits his motel room via the window and needs a ride out of town...quick!  Carmen Green, a beautiful Mexican/American picks him up almost immediately and launches into her story about an abusive husband who is a member of a powerful local family.  She has no money and has spent days looking for a hitchhiker who will help her kill her husband so she and her daughter can get away.  Now we all know that Reacher doesn't just go around &quot;killing&quot; people, however, he is touched by Carmen's story and goes back to the ranch with her to see what he can do to help.  The husband gets killed, Carmen gets arrested, the daughter is taken from the ranch, and the suspense builds as Reacher tries to figure out what is going on. <br />Reacher fans will remember that Jack travels without luggage and only a toothbrush in his shirt pocket.  Buying new clothes every three days or so adds humor to this series especially in Lubbock where the heat and terrible weather make it a really awful idea to wear the same garments for several hours.  Even so Jack Reacher is huge, brilliant, and able to shoot in the dark or wherever the villans are.  And he always finds the right girl to help solve the case.

Jordan is on assignment when she walks into a museum in Hong Kong and happens on an exhibit of nude women who appear at first sight to be sleeping.  Actually they may be dead. In either event the paintings are compelling, and as Jordan walks along the exhibit hall, she comes face to face with a painting of her kidnapped twin sister who had been taken from her home town of New Orleans.  <br />Jordan leaves Hong Kong as quickly as she can run to the airport and calls the FBI from the plane.  Before going on to Washington as directed, she stops in New York to visit Wingate, the art dealer who had sold the paintings to the museum in Hong Kong.  Before she can learn what Wingate knows about her sister, the building catches fire and Wingate is dies in the blaze.  Jordan narrowly escapes to make her way to Washington to finally connect with the FBI.  John Kaiser, the FBI agent who works with Jordan as they work their way through this incredible maze of clues and misdirection makes a great second character in the book.  Dead Sleep is impossible to put down once begun.  John and Jordan are written so well together that it would be shame to let them go at the end of Dead Sleep.  They would make a great new team for a series.	2001-07-22

He lives with his mother and father and his father's parents in a small unpainted house on a farm.  They are cotton farmers.  When cotton picking time arrives, Luke's quota for the day is 50 pounds.  This story is told through Luke's experiences of watching the adults worry about the weather, the price of cotton, hiring Mexicans and Hill People to help pick cotton and through his part in a struggling proud family who all live, work, and worry together.  <br />Any reader who has ever known a seven year old boy will love Luke as he narrates the hiring of the Mexicans and watches the hill people move in and camp in his front yard right over home plate.  Luke's ambition is to grow up and become a baseball player for the Cardinals in St. Louis.  As you read through the days of cotton picking and some difficult adult situations that Luke sees happen, you hope that all his dreams will come true and he will be able to get away from the hardships he has witnessed.  <br />Grisham does not need a courtroom and a chase scene to write a memorable book with characters that will come to mind again and again.

In &quot;The Hearing&quot; Abe has a problem and Dismas has to help solve the case as he defends a drug addict with few redeaming qualties who has supposedly killed Elaine Wager.  Elaine was perceived to have been a leading member of the black legal community with a good reputation.  One of her secrets was that Abe Glitsky was her father.  Abe had learned the truth before Elaine's murder, but had not confronted her with it, and after she was killed, he went after the first suspect with a vengence.  He refused to allow the suspect medical attention as he was going through herion withdrawl and gave the go ahead for a strenuous interrogation resulting in a &quot;confession.&quot;  The suspect, Cole Burgess, looks like a promising candidate especially since he was found near the body and had her money and jewelry on his person.  Cole's mother is the only one who really cares any longer about what happens to him.<br />Dismas Hardy is the reluctant defense attorney brought in by Cole's mother.  As the story continues, a web of political corruption unfolds within the DA's office and the police department.  Elaine Wager's own life was not what it had seemed to be, but as she began to investigate some of the corruption she found, she was trying to made amends when she was murdered.<br />Elaine's personal assistant, Treya Ghent, is an interesting new character in this series who adds another dimension to the life of Abe Glitsky.

However, it's a 4* rather than a 5* because there is too much drifting away from solving the mysteries with subplots involving Alex's personal problems with an old love, Christine, who just can't handle his work and life style any more; his daughter who has a brain tumor and an operation, and a new almost love affair that lacks intensity until it is too late.	2001-04-07

It appears that Danny, the 13 year old son of the Police chief, is the shooter who has killed a teacher and two young elementary school girls.  From newspaper reports of the case, guilt would seem to be obvious.  HOWEVER, and this is what makes the book well worth reading, there is a manipulative psychopath on the loose who has been comunicating with Danny on the internet and has figured out all the buttons to push to accomplish his own agenda.  <br />The story line is a warning to parents with children who are not dealing with stress and pressure either at home or school or both and how to watch for the signs of unleased rage.

Her husband, Lamar Hoyt had a history of running around on his wives and then trading them in on a new model as the old one became tiresome.  His son hated him for not giving him a bigger piece of the Undertaking business that had created the family fortune.  <br />A new and relatively inexperienced, but brilliant, Judge is assigned the case after having been newly transferred to the homicide rotation.  Judge Quinn is idealistic and in love with the law ... maybe more so than his wife who wants power and money more that Judge Quinn appears to.  A subplot takes place when Judge Quinn travels to an island for a convention only find at the last minute that his wife cannot accompany him.  She has been tricked into making another trip so that Judge Quinn can be seduced on his trip by a call girl who is eventually killed.  The judge proves to be naive and gullable.  <br />The book begins with the fact that Ellen Crease did shoot her husband.  It has more than enough characters to be somewhat confusing, but the suspense is sustained by the fact that we don't know WHY Lamar Hoyt died until we reach the end.  And then we find out about the mystery bad guy.  Read the book.  This doesn't make five starts, but it's a good read.	2001-03-13

After Ernesto Castro,s drug dealing conviction, he threatens her saying, &quot;For everything I lose, you will lose twice.&quot;  When Kirsten's husband is shot down by a professional hit man in front of her, she and Amy change their names and leave town thinking they can relocate with the support of friends in her state but without any real protection.  When Amy is nearly kidnapped, she asks for help from the Federal Witness Security Program (WITSEC) <br />The story line continues to develop as the reader learns that Kirsten has been a vocal and successful critic of the program and there are many federal agents who do not think she deserves their protection whatever the danger to her and her child.  As she joins the program and is relocated to Boulder, Colorado, she requests the help of a psychologist to help her deal with all the trauma that she is dealing with.  The psychologist is Dr. Alan Gregory, and old friend from Stephen White's previous books.  <br />Dr. Gregory is also treating a second member of the WITSEC program...a mob hit man named Carl Luppo.  Carl and Kirsten meet as the suspense grows and Kirsten realizes that she knows someone wants to kill her, but that she cannot determine by herself if it is Ernesto Castro, someone within the WITSEC program, or a third party from an old case that she had prosecuted.  The book is worth reading to find out who all the characters are and whether or not they are the bad guys with the intent to kill.  <br />Incidentally Dr. Gregory's wife, Laura, an Assistant DA herself, gets involved with helping solve the mystery even though she is nearly ready to have the baby that she and Alan were waiting for in an earlier book.  The old neighbor Adreinne is still next door as well even though she plays only a very minor role.  The book is a page turner worth reading and Stephen White is an author I will look for again.	2001-03-05

In Hard Evidence, Dismas Hardy has recovered from his son's death and his long &quot;drop out&quot; period of running the bar with his brother-in-law.  He has married Frannie, adopted her first child and they are expecting a baby of their own.  He has gone back to work in the DA's office and as the new guy is stuck with the more mundane criminal cases that are usually pleaded out.  He is waiting for a murder case to prosecute.  <br />Along comes a hand recovered from the belly of a shark.  The first challenge is to identify the victim and to determine whether the hand belonged to a hapless swimmer or a murder victim.  The suspense builds when a body washes up on the shore with bullet holes in the crotch and the head of a very dead male.<br />What makes this book hard to put down is the rapid succession from one suspect to another without any &quot;hard evidence.&quot;  Lescroart explores the politics and ambitions of the people involved in the justice system revealing how much more personal it all becomes rather than a true search for justice.  <br />A large part of Hard Evidence is about Dismas Hardy and his return to the practice of trial law.  He is a renegade within the system who just cannot accept the easy answer on the surface.  His personal tempations and insecurities are a little tiring but add to the development of his hard working and driven quest for the truth.	2001-02-26

Michael Connelly has combined two fascinating heroes from past books in a suspenseful novel that keeps you up until you reach the end.  Terry McCaleb who received a heart transplant and is on disability, has been spending his days waiting for fishing charters.  His wife, Graciela, from his book Bloodwork, has given him a new baby daughter that he is enamored with.  However, when Jaye Winston from the Sheriff's Department shows up to ask his help in solving a murder that is getting colder and colder, Terry can't wait to get into the &quot;book.&quot;  At the same time Harry Bosh is the key witness in a sensational trial involving David Storey accused of killing a date after consensual sex and then trying to make it look like sucicide.  How the two cases meet and put Harry nearly on the wrong side of the suspect list is the heart of the storey.  Just read it!<br />As an interesting aside, there is a minor character in the book that is the central character in a Michael Connelly short storey published on the internet.  While I printed it out to read and found the writing just as good as expected from Connelly, I was disappointed in the story.  Probably I just prefer the fleshed out longer pages of a full size Connelly novel, and I will look for the next one.  At the end of A Darkness More than Night the relationship between Bosh and McCaleb appeared to be terminated, but anything is possible with fiction.  I hope they come back to work another case.	2001-02-12

What a timely work !  In Protect and Defend, immediately after the new President is sworn in, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has a fatal stroke. Newly elected President Kilcannon now has the opportunity to nominate a liberal candidate of his choice to take over this spot on the court.  The big issue in the confirmation hearings, just as in the Ashcroft hearings, is abortion.  The plot of Protect and Defend involves the right of a young girl, and the bitter fight that ensues, to have a late term abortion against her parents wishes.  This work presents the thinking of the pro-choice forces and the pro-life forces with a great deal of sensitivity and information. It also gives much needed information on late term abortions and the rationale, if such is possible, for allowing them to be performed.  Whatever your personal beliefs and value system require in your thinking regarding roe v. wade, this book will give you reason to think and reflect on one of the most difficult political issues that face Americans today.  <br />The characters become real people with the emotions and difficulties that each reader will find somewhere in his own family. Most of them were introduced in prior novels by Patterson, so for the Patterson fan, it's like revisiting some old friends with new problems.  However, if this is your first Patterson book, the background is filled in whenever necessary. This, in my opinion, is Richard North Patterson's best yet in a long list of great books.	2001-02-11

Sarah's Sin from 1992 was figured to be a romance novel from the title, and sure enough it was.  While it didn't seem like Tami Hoag, or at least the one I had grown to look forward to, it was a sweet story about a cocky ER doctor from Minneapolis who had been wounded in a gun fight and ends up recuperating in a small town in Minnesota nearl an Armish settlement.  A young Amish widow is working at the bread and breakfast run by the doctor's sister and is assigned the job of taking care of him as he recovers his strength.  Of course the two of them are attracted to each other.  Having grown up with the Armish of Central Illinois, I found Sarah's character believable and true to the Armish culture.  The story is about Sarah's longing to leave her &quot;plain&quot; life and accept her love and move on to the world at large with all its opportunities and challenges.  It's a fast read and a sweet story. The sex is a little idealistic, but it's good fuel for a night of fantasy.  Stick it in your beach bag and enjoy.	2001-01-17

In the latter books he was already married to Frannie with hints about a troubled past.  Going Back to The Vig at the beginning of the story he is getting back together with his first wife but still in his bummed out mode.  He is tending bar with his friend Moses when Rusty Ingraham walks in one day telling him a tale about a con who is to be released that has promised to come looking to kill the both of them.  Actually Rusty has come up with a complicated scam designed to allow him to disappear and Dismas to be the one to point the finger at the ex-con for killing him.  There are several semmingly unrelated murders that keep going back to a mob enforcer who has been collecting &quot;The Vig&quot;...the ever increasing interest on loan sharking.  Dismas' friend, Abe doesn't take the threat on Hardy's life seriously enough and it falls to Hardy to prove that Baker, the ex-con did not commit the murders he is accused of.  The various characters are well developed and the story works well.  The challenge of solving the mysteries helps to rehabilitate Dismas Hardy and sees him begin a relationship with Frannie who becomes his wife in future novels.  If you didn't read it along the way, read it now.  Lescroart is great reading.	2001-01-15

David Nash is a defense attorney who is suffering burn out when he meets a mysterious young woman at a party and takes her back to his house.  The next day when he realizes that he wants to see her again, she is no where to be found, surfacing only when her husband is accused of killing a policewoman who was posing as a prostitute.  The wife swears that her husband was with her at the time the crime took place, and David agrees to take the defense in spite of his reservations about their involvement.  All the while he is trying to come to grips with having successfully defended some guilty clients who will undoubtedly hurt others again as soon as they are free.  My review is not nearly as gripping as the book was to read. This is my second book by Phillip Margolin and I am looking forward to my third which will be &quot;Gone But Not Forgotten.&quot; In a world full of good legal thriller authors, he is one of the best in my opinion.	2001-01-04

Key people in the industry are being killed in different parts of the country by a killer who works cleanly leaving no clues at all.  I bought the book because I liked the &quot;O'Reilly Factor&quot; and wanted to see for myself how Mr. O'Reilly's how first novel worked.  His characters are built out of people he knows...Irish Americans, Catholics, and network people as well as some well developed policemen.  The only problem for me was the female, a newspaper writer, who becomes involved with both the killer and the cop who is determined to solve the case.  She hops into bed with the bad guy and thinks about hopping into bed with the cop almost at the same time which made that part of the story a little hard to believe.  It was a good read, and I suspect his next book will be better yet.  I would hope to see a series of Tommy O'Malley mysteries develop.  Tommy is BIG in size and macho; he has a nasty black Irish temper; wants to take out the bad guys in a hard way; and takes good care of his mother.  He's a nice tough guy.	2001-01-01

The hero, this time, is Nicholas Bryson who thinks for fifteen years that he is an operative for the Directorate a group so deeply hidden that only his boss Ted Waller knows about his assignments. He's good.  In fact he is the best of the covert operatives surving all the usual hardships along with a death defying physical wound that occurs in the opening of the story when he is exposed as a &quot;traitor&quot; in an operation that he has set up. <br />Following his recovery Ted retires him giving him a new identity and he goes off to teach in a small college for five years.  He spends the five years quietly enjoying his classes but mourning the loss of a much loved wife, Elana, who had left him and totally disappeared during his final assignment.  So far the book made sense, but there was a lot of reading left to go.  At this point The CIA recruits Bryson to investigate the Directorate telling him that instead of being patriots the members of that group were actually Russian spies.<br />Leaving the college, he travels through several countries in search of the truth, excapes death a few times and unravels a complex set of deceptions.  The only person true to Bryson was Elana who reappears and helps him find his way through the maze of characters that Mr. Ludlum has fleshed out. <br />As a long time fan of Ludlum books, I thought many of the  earlier books were better, because the plots were more believable.  If this is your first book, go back and read the  The Scorpio Illusion.  THEN you will want to read more of Ludlum's many books.	2000-12-24

He must be a good artist because he does not have another source of income.  The plot involving two seemingly unrelated murders is interesting enough. St. John Corbiel as head of a company called AmMath has come up with a software program that will intercept intelligence satalites, and he is selling photos and information to foriegn buyers.  The two murder victims got to close to what he was doing and Corbiel's people killed them. The sister of Jack Morrison, one of the victims looks to Kidd to find out why her brother was murdered.  <br />There is not a great deal of mystery throughout the book.  The plot is fairly simple, the characters are predictable, and the ending is not really a surprise.  Kidd is interesting enough to carry the reader through to the end of the book, but not enough to make me log on to find the other Kidd books.  I like Lucas Davenport better and hope there will be another &quot;Prey&quot; book soon.	2000-12-04

In The Incumbent, a newspaper journalist, Jack Flynn is invited to play golf with the sitting president Clayton Hutchins and to his surprise is offered the job of press secretatry if Hutchins is elected.  The offer was as much a surprise as the two gunshots that left both the President and Flynn wounded.  When Jack received a call in the hospital from a mysterious caller informing him that nothing was not as it seemed, it started him on an investigation that ultimately led to critical information about Hutchins who was only a day away from being elected President of the United States for the first time.  (He had taken over the office the first time when his predecessor died in office.) The story's plot seemed to have the ulterior motive of convincing us of the public's right to know.  It was more about how journalists work and defend their intrusions than the  mystery of the story.  The suspense, however, worked and for a first novel was good enough to warrant looking for more work from this author.  It gives nothing away to add that the voting public elected Hutchins in spite of what Jack Flynn revealed to them; just as the voters in New York elected Hillary in spite of what they already knew about her.	2000-11-11

The only problem with the book is Corey who is so anti-establishment that he never has a straight line.  His constant wisecracking gets a little tedious.

When she is assigned to David's wife's murder, she becomes involved with David and loses some of her objectivity which causes even more discension between she and her partner.

In &quot;Killing Floor&quot; he just happens to get off the bus near the intersection of a small town in Georgia and after wandering on foot into the town of Margrave he is immediately arrested for a brutal murder which he obviously did not commit.  He digs his way through several mysteries at one time including the identity of the murdered man.  The suspense never lets up; there is a girl (a cop) that he loves but leaves with good romance and dialogue throughout.  The only problem I had with the hero is that he arrives without any luggage and only occasionaly needs to buy a new outfit of clothes as he thows away what he has on at the time.  He gives new meaning to traveling light.  I'm going to quit writing now and start reading the next book...&quot;Die Trying&quot; I hope to see more of Jack Reacher after I have caught up with the next two.	2000-09-27

The story line had good possibilities, but the writing was too simplistic.  Reading the first  couple of lines in a paragraph was enough to make a quick scan through.   The humor between the hero and his partner was adolescent and did not add  much to the story line.	2000-09-20

The men have been brought together by a psychologist, Dr.  Brainbridge who seems to be encouraging their hatreds to grow with each  meeting of the club.  One of the members takes on the role of encouraging  the other to exact revenge by hurting/killing the women they have loved.   The detective working the case is called Con Man by his friend and partner,  Mickey.  The two of them are the two riches cops in the city which doesn't  seem to have a lot to do with anything in the story, however Conrad Voort's  biggest connection to the plot is that his own lover has just told  him  that she wants out of their intense relationship.  As he begins to  investigate the murders his concern for his lover grows as he finds that  she is going to the psychologist who is hosting the Lonely Hearts Club  meetings.  It's a plot with a twist but one that has been used elsewhere  with more depth and interest.  The book is an ok read.	2000-09-17
US	52045373	R2GAFISKDL52A4	0399146245	897342569	24 Hours	Books	5	2	3	N	N	24 Hours	Greg Iles takes a parent's greatest fear, the kidnaping of a child, and  turns it into a pageturner of a mystery.  The kidnapper promises early in  the book that the &quot;kid always makes it&quot; and he has developed a  plan that enables him to keep commiting the same crime over and over again.   I thought it was highly charged suspense.  I'm already hoping a new Iles  book is ready for preorder.	2000-09-09
US	52045373	R3000N10TX1RY5	067102678X	220318053	False Accusations	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Re. False Accusations	This book starts off with a high interest hit and run.  A female character who is every man's nightmare is introduced at the same time that Dr.  Madison is accused of driving the hit and run car.  Brittany Harding makes  a career of taking offense and verbally stalking everyone she deals with.   There are too many pages of Brittany's repeated offenses and the troubles  she caused the good doctor with the sterling reputation.  It's a real  stretch of the imagination for the police to believe that Brittany stole  Dr. Madison's car, killed two people, and returned it.  Dr. Madison,  however, calls in a favor from a top notch investigator to help prove his  case.  The book is tedius in the middle but has a knockout of a surprise  ending.  I was glad that I finished it.	2000-09-03

When his  wife disappears he discovers a whole new life that she had without him, and  he realizes that he doesn't even know the name of his daughter's best  friend.  This book was a page turner and Grippando at his best so far.   Hope he writes another soon.	2000-08-24

She is driven to succeed at all costs and he is cripled.  They travel to North Carolina hoping to find some improvement for  Lincoln in an experimental surgery and wind up in the middle of a  murder/kidnapping.  The setting is a small town with almost everyone there  having an agenda of his/her own.  The book is a great suspense read with  characters that have surprising strengths and weaknesses.  The ending  prepares the way for a new Lincoln Rhyme book.  I will look forward to it.	2000-06-03
US	52045373	RSDWVOW1R7961	0525937935	333139516	The Quiet Game	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A great new find	This was my first Greg Iles book, and I have gone back to order more and will look for his books to come.  The characters were well developed, and the plot fascinating.  In going back 30 years to solve a murder,  relationships that have changed the course of lives, and the events in the  town of Natchez come to light.  The Quiet Game is more compelling and  literate than Grisham's books. I enjoyed the insight into Mississippi  culture and the racial boundaries that existed in the late 60's as well as  the ongoing revelations about J. Edgar Hoover.	2000-02-21
