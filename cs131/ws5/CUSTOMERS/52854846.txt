Wells	This would be an interesting and touching novel even without the time travel stuff.  These people are believable, they want to be in love and have a family, and they have complicated lives.<br />With the addition of involuntary time travel, it is ingenious.  The time travel is not hocus-pocus but rather matter-of-fact.  It makes some scenes of romantic and domestic life even more revealing.  And some minor moments become big.<br />The audiobook readers also deserve commendation.  They have clear diction, good intonation, and interesting variation in tone.  They make good characterizations without overwhelming the text.  Good work.	2004-02-14

It's schizey.  Read it quickly, getting past the bad stuff, and it's a good beach thriller and a little bit more.	2003-06-26

The lead character is in the category of teenagers in horror movies, i.e., doing stuff so stupid that you want to yell out to stop them.  (E.g., how many times can someone talk to the FBI against their lawyer's clear advice and still be surprised that it doesn't work out?  Or is it possible that a young surgeon knows less about DNA than the average TV viewer?)  It's so implausible that my disbelief became unsuspended.<br />Moreover the narrator who recorded it settles into an annoying sing-song that leaves all sentences sounding sort of alike and that has little variation from character to character.  It's hard to listen to.<br />I miss this author's great lead character, Myron Bolitar (who is funny and smart), but I'll settle for a lot less.  This is just not anywhere near satisfactory.	2003-05-21

The mystery almost gets lost in the sometimes witty/sometimes not parallels between this plot and the opera of almost the same name.  The detective is well-developed, but no other character is.

It is a great plot that works on its surface in the manner of Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot.  Underneath it is a profound commentary on mysticism and the manipulation of humanity's views of itself and its beliefs.  It is the Ur mystery and yet very readable.

It seemed to be a mind-numbing mix of similar facts with different conclusions. Then I read this book and--voila--it all seemed to flow together so cohesively and clearly.  And, on top of that, the book is well written, has flashes of humor, and is very short.  What a great book this is for any law student.	2002-06-18

The plot is twisting.  And the action unfolds at a good but unexaggerated pace.  It's great mystery/police-procedural reading.  And yet it doesn't have the same spark and wit and personal quirks that the earlier ones (which are 5 stars plus) do.  But start with earlier Bosch and come to this willing to cut some slack and it's well worth it.  (The reader on the audio version (unabridged) has good voice characterizations that keep all conversations clear and add some emotion.)	2002-04-08

The characters are mostly predictable.  A few good twists make it passable, and it's neither vulgar (but what's with that strangely out-of-place lovemaking scene that seems dropped in from another book?) nor violent.

Very well developed characters.  Beautiful writing.  Sometimes the writing is so lyrical that it feels like music.  The narration is so sympathetic to all parties that it transcends the situation.  <br />And the reader of this book on tape is excellent.

It's a police procedural (not a mystery) and the procedure is generally ok, but none of the characters is well developed.  It's passingly interesting for an airplane, but not much more.

It's not as good as HHGG, but that's asking a lot.  It is, however, clever and quick, with wry references to Faust, Helen of Troy, and Hieronymous Bosch and lots of contemporary commentary (Australia doesn't come off too well).

Using the devices of a different, unreliable narrators combined with the necessary re-fitting of the facts with each new narrative, the book changes as you turn each page.  I like that kind of inventiveness.  Now, there's also a whole lot of Restoration history here, too, with some real and some fictional folk.  It's occasionally too detailed for easy reading, but by the conclusion, it's definitely worth it.  Memorable.	2001-11-26

I pick it up when I walk by it, read one, and feel re-connected and less numb.  Give this to someone you know who's tired (it's easy reading) or sad or disconnected from daily reading or daily life.

But it's almost charmless (except for the Canadian accents, which are pleasant).  The characters have idiosyncracies, but they're not interesting.  The plots are either downright dumb (as in title story) or so quickly sketched that it's sort of just starting by the time it's solved.
