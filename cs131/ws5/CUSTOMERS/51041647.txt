Ms Lahiri provides valuable insights into marginal  characters who travel between two worlds.<br />Lahiri's &quot;Interpreter of  Maladies&quot; is also a great contribution to new and emerging diasporic  literature in which lives of people who are living away from their home and  their displacement, rootlessness, and the ambivalence is portrayed.  In  these stories Ms Lahiri does more than that.   Her stories provide powerful  insights into life, love, relationships moreover the pains of living away  from home.

Topics covered include; `strategic approaches to  product recalls', `leadership', `what happens when an executive defects'  and how companies can develop better media policies and plans as part of  crisis management and preparedness. <br />My favorite is Norman R Augustine's  essay titled `Managing the Crisis You Tried to Prevent'.  In this well  researched essay, Augustine describes six stages of a crisis drawing  lessons from several well-known crises.

I still don't know much about modern Irish novelists until I had the opportunity of meeting  and listening to parts of Timothy O'Grady's novel at Perth Writer's  Festival early this year.  Immediately afterwards I bought a copy and later  talked to Timothy briefly about writers in exile and their struggle with  dislocation.  This story is not only about dislocation and exile.  This is  the story of a man coming of age and following a journey during which he  struggles to make sense of his life, dislocation, loss of love and  loneliness.<br />This lyrically crafted novel is a great collaboration between  O'Grady and photographer Steve Pyke.  They collectively create a visual  journey of a musical Irishman, his journey from one location to another,  looking for work and the love of his life. O'Grady's begins his novel with  a description of the protagonist's life back at home as a child: <br />\\"This  room is dark, as dark as it ever gets - the hour before dawn in winter.  I  have sounds and pictures but they flit and crash before I can get them...\\"   <br />For me, it is a metaphor of not been able to recreate the places and the  people he left behind as a result of his journey.  <br />O'Grady ends his  novel with a similar narrative:  <br />\\"In the room now a breeze comes in  through the window and on it there is the smell of spring.  Downstairs the  girl turns on her radio... There is a time after long work when you can  look for strength and there is nothing there....<br />In the morning light I  let go.\\"<br />In between, we learn about his journey, his recollection of  Irish landscapes, the places left behind, the music he played and his love.   But this is not just a mere description of a nostalgic mental journey of  an Irishman in exile.  This can happen anywhere, anytime, and to  anyone.<br />Reading this novel is like watching a visually crafted  documentary embedded with voice and music that we can see and hear.<br />I'm  glad that I met O'Grady and read his novel as my introduction to modern  Irish novelists.  But this novel had another positive effect on me.  When I  met O'Grady I was writing a novel about my own dislocation.  This novel  inspired me to look at my private journey again and again, and continue my  writing in exile!<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the  beauty and tragic of moving from one place to another.	2000-06-05
US	51041647	R3G4IUK40QEX1V	0449901815	297642766	Living Loving and Learning	Books	5	39	40	N	N	Reading it again and again since 1984	I first learnt about Dr Leo Buscaglia and his works in May 1984 when I received the wonderful gift of the book, `Living, Loving and Learning' from my then boss and life-time mentor Fred Davis while working in Colombo, Sri  Lanka.  Although I studied and grew up in a culture which had given me some  knowledge into all three concepts covered in the book, I found it to be a  useful resource kit.  I have read the book so many times since 1984 and  still reading it again and again.<br />In May 1984, I was young, strong,  irrational and did not fully grasp the value of love and or human relations  but I thought I knew about living and learning.  I received the book just  three months before our daughter was born and realised the important of  `love' as a `behaviour modifier'.  Ever since, I have learnt many other  things from this book as well from other sources. Dr Buscaglia writes about  love and the importance of giving as well as receiving this unexplainable  desire from the time of our birth to death.  Now I know that life is  nothing but a journey of seeking, giving and rejection of love.  <br />A few  months ago our daughter was very down, apparently due to the pains of  growing up.  Perhaps I would have been a major party in that process.  May  be she had peer pressure which she didn't want to communicate with me.   Perhaps she thought that I was not listening to her needs (and I still do  that mistake)!.  When she was very down, I approached and `tactfully  demanded' her (like many parents do) to read the book.  I even highlighted  the section that she should read.  A few days later she returned the book  and said:  \\"Dad, this book has a lot of what you always talk about!\\". She  smiled and thanked me.  It was a very precious moment in my life. Then only  I realised how much I have unconsciously acquired Dr Buscaglia's wisdom  over the years despite still making mistakes as an adult as well as a  parent.<br />Now, getting closer to my mid-life, after having travelled round  the world, up-rooted myself and my family from our country of origin,  receiving and perhaps not receiving enough love as a behaviour modifier, I  still read the book because I am still growing up.  <br />I am at a point in  my life where love and affection as Dr Buscaglia defined in this book are  much needed for my further growth and development.  Now I am learning the  need to care, respect and love everyone I live and work with, meet, talk or  write sometimes even seeing them at all!  Dr Buscaglia cites a good example  in this book where he had not cared enough for a student who he thought was  learning well in one of his undergraduate classes.  He assumed that he was  communicating well with this student because she sat in front of him,  smiled when he emphasised something and took down notes carefully.  He  writes: \\"Then one day she stopped coming... and I kept looking for her...  Finally, I checked with the Dean...and she said, `Haven't you heard?'\\" Dr  Buscaglia learnt that the student had killed herself by jumping off a  cliff.  He writes: \\"It bothers me still and I thought to myself--what are  we doing stuffing facts at people and forgetting that they are people, that  they are human beings?\\" <br />This book is not about stuffing facts or giving  us just citations from psychology or sociology books. He shares the wisdom  he has gathered from several sources on `Living, Loving and Learning'. This  book is a guide to help us to be good human beings.  For those who only  want to read new world stuff may think that this book is a bit of an old  fashion or just a basic one.  Yes, it is a basic guide for us to be good  human beings.  <br />That's why I am still reading this book 16 years after  receiving it from my mentor.  That's why I am still sharing the knowledge I  gained from it with those who are closer to my heart wherever they live.   Because I had the gift of receiving books, I always returned the same to  those I love very much.  Recently,I gave a gift of books to a person that  I have never met because of that person's loving qualities and wisdom  shared with me despite my colour, creed, race and age!  Now I regret that I  could not include this book in my gift pack.<br />For me this book is still a  one sure way of `Living, Loving and Learning'.<br />Just read it!<br />Sunil  Govinnage<br />June 2000	2000-06-04

The book does not contain mere \\"quick-fix solutions to relieve the stress and anxiety of daily life\\".  `Instant Calm' although is about crisis control, brings together over  hundred of the most powerful stress management techniques known to the  humans from ancient times to the discoveries of modern research on stress  management. These include meditation, yoga, ancient relaxation techniques  such as Tsu-sanli, Feng-Chih, acupressure, self-hypnosis, massage,  aromatherapy, exercise, diet and much more.  Some of these `other' remedies  include `dance', `unfold chair' and `calm hugs' which has been described as  \\"one of the most effective techniques of finding comfort in troubled  moments...\\" For those who don't have the luxury of receiving `calm hugs'  can try listening to `calm music' and or `calm your own wrist' with the  other hand!<br />What I liked most about the book was simple, jargon-free  ideas and instructions. I liked the page on `calm affirmation'.  It  reminded me that the list of the words at the end of this section can help  me to convert the negatives into positives.  For example, `panic' can be  replaced with `peace'.  The `anger' can be turned into `love' and `failure'  can be substituted with `success'.<br />The book is packed with immediate  remedial and effective methods of eliminating stress, negativity and lack  of energy from our life.<br />It is a handbook for those who have to live with  stress and worries in this modern `age of anxiety'.	2000-06-04

The main protagonist in this novel, Abe Ravelstein is a university teacher. \\"He was not one of those conservatives who idolize the  free market. He had views of his own on political and moral matters.\\"  He  has also written a best seller which has made him very rich, at least  materially.  \\"He attracted gifted students. His classes were always full  up.\\"  Despite all these achievements, finally, the death reaches him.  He  died of AIDS.<br />Evidently, `Ravelstein' is based on Allan Bloom who wrote  in the late 80s the controversial `The Closing of the American Mind'.  \\"We  live in a thought-world, and the thinking has gone very bad indeed.''   Wrote Saul Bellow, in his foreword to Allan Bloom's controversial book some  13 years ago.  <br />It appears that `Ravelstein' is rather fragmented frames  of Bellow's memory of Alan Bloom.  Some readers may find it difficult to  understand the meaning of this book.  I'm sure the Gay community will label  it as an anti-gay novel.  I am not sure whether that was Bellow's  intention.  Does he want us to get deeper insights into the darkness of  human nature?<br />One of the most important question about Bellow's  `Ravelstein' is the role of a writer and his ability to pass or not to pass  judgements on moral issues or the question of mortality.  In this novel  Bellow passes a judgement about Ravelstein's \\"sex habits&quot; in fact, as  he calls &quot;reckless sex habits&quot; which I'm sure will not be  acceptable to the gay community around the world.<br />In the novel,  Ravelstein questions, &quot;With what, in this modern day democracy, will  you meet the demands of your soul?&quot;  This is indeed a difficult  question to answer.  I believe the same may applies to the message Bellow  wants his readers to get out of this important novel about an important  theme.<br />In the novel Bellow writes: \\"It means that writers are supposed to  make you laugh and cry. That's what mankind is looking for.\\"  This is what  exactly Bellow has achieved in `Ravelstein'.<br />It is worth reading a great  American writer's new novel which is sad and also a witty portrait of an  American academic who has been fighting against the vulgarity that has  engulfed American life.<br />\\"There are things that people should know if they  are to read books at all...\\" wrote Bellow in concluding his introduction to  Allan Bloom's `The Closing of the American Mind'.  In my view, `Ravelstein'  is nothing but what Bellow wants his readers to know about some, perhaps  dark aspect of American life.	2000-06-01

'Running in the Family' is an outstandingly evocative autobiographical account of Michael Ondaatje's journey back to his beginnings in Sri Lanka. It is an attempt to trace his origin, record the history of his family and  understand his father who was a mystery to him.  In the process he also  provides rare insights into his family and his growth and development such  as the early exposure to literature etc.  When I read his latest novel,  Anil's Ghost' I discovered how a few locations, names and places he  captured in this book has resurfaced in the novel.  <br />This is indeed an  original piece of work.  <br />I enjoyed the book full of lyrical writing.

Ondaatje adds value to his  original masterpiece when he reads to you with his soft and hypnotic  voice.<br />This is one of the rare opportunities of listening to a great  writer of our time.	2000-05-28

Primarily, he is a poet.  Secondly a novelist.  This collection contains a great variety of poems about day to day life, love, marriage, deep observations about children,  humour, history and many more.<br />My favourite poem is &quot;&quot;To a Sad  Daughter&quot;  which has a universal appeal.

It displays an abundance of talents of a great writer who later (1993) won the Nobel Prize for Literature.<br />The novel is set in  Lorain, Ohio, in 1941.  It is the story of 11 year old girl, Pecola  Breedlove. This is a powerful story which draws from several themes such as  historical memory, racial hatred and several other important themes. Pecola  who is a black girl and attracted to blond, blue-eyed children and prays  for her eyes to turn blue like the children she adores. The journey of  Pecola 's agony is powerfully portrayed and crafted aesthetically.<br />It is  a poetical examination into the beauty of logic and irrationality behind an  American family and how and why this innate beauty gets wasted and  overlooked in the World's most democratic society.<br />It is not just a story  of Pecola Breedlove, a young black American kid.  You may find similar  characters all over the world. I have heard stories similar to Pecola in  many countries where I have lived including Australia!<br />No wonder why it  is a best seller and resurfaced again winning the attention of thousands  and thousands of readers. It may be the reason why it was selected for  Oprah's book club in April 2000.	2000-05-25
