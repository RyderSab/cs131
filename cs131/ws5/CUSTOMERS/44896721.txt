The stand alone was right.  You didn't have to read the previous ones to pick this up and read it, whenever there was a reference to back story, it was explained.  In full.  Multiple times.  This was my biggest problem with the book actually, the repeat re-read of details over and over just bored me to tears.  Then there was the story.  This was not good, if anything non-existant.  A good editor could have carved this down to a 50 page story, it was mostly just lamenting over the past.  I know that was the point of wanting to be human, but did it ever just drag on.  Now I did like the perspective of how the vampire felt and his removal from society, and some of the longing for old ways was good, but there was JUST TOO MUCH OF IT!!!  anyways, I can't say this was worth it.	2005-08-11
US	44896721	R52WZPDQG3PRG	0156029987	701095379	Vernon God Little	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Vernon Good Little	There's a fair number of reviews on this one, so I'll just throw my 2 cents worth in.  I liked it, I thought the \\"paradigm\\" shifts were great, how no matter what happened, spin doctoring can make it look totally different.  He talks about \\"the knife\\" family can use on you, and I certainly related to that, nice to see someone else having the problem too :-)  There's a fair bit of media bashing, that I certainly enjoyed and of people in general (everything that happened in the State during his spree was done by him, there were WITNESSES, that was pretty funny).  anyways, coming close to giving information away here... <br /> <br />I thought the character was very well done, I thought the writing was damn good, and the story was interesting and humorous (in a dark humor kind of way) and I'd recommend this for a read.  It's fairly short, so even if you think it's only ok, you will not waste a lot of time on it.	2005-07-21

Morgan takes a fairly cool idea and instead of exploring the idea of where it leads you from a society POV or from a possibility POV, he pre-generates the societies and then tells a sci-fi noire story of a new age special ops detective.  The idea is good, the writing is ok, and the worlds are great.  I personally found the violence in this book brutal, yet fascinating.  It started in the prologue and even from the first few pages, the \\"shock and awe\\" had me looking forward to the rest of it.  And it was there through the rest of the book too.  There's some pretty vivid sex in this as well, though, I found it took away from the story as opposed to making it better, for a guy who was special trained for being self-reliant and a hard case, he fell into sex traps a lot.  Anyways, just what I thought.   <br />I found this a long book and after 2/3's? the way through, I was getting fairly bored with it.  The start had me racing, this was pretty cool, and the violence was \\"wow, that's harsh\\" kind of stuff, things you shouldn't enjoy but you do.  And the story was interesting as to everything else that was happing, but the base investigation of a suicide was ok (no plot give aways here).  After 2/3's I found I thought the events were still interesting, and a good way to clue things up, but the fascination wasn't there anymore.   <br />It was a strong start and an ok end.	2005-06-28

The characters were compeling, the writing satirical and the overall effect disturbing.  I'm curious as too how much of this has been lost due to translation, it's very good now.  There is some excellent one liner prose in this that really catch you \\"she kept looking over her shoulder like someone in love with thier foot prints\\" gave me such a vivid idea of the scene that it's still in my head.  Now, having said I liked it, it took me a long time to finish this.  It's LONG, and after awhile, I found I was reading this because I was honor bound to finish it as opposed to picking it up with enthusiasm.  Not that I disliked it, just it wore down.  It's very well structured until toward the end, and I don't know if it was symbolic of something, but it seemed to self-destruct, a lot of things start to repeat, the linear process is starting to come apart, and the over detailed life events were just described in passing.  I recommend this book for people who like literature, not just reading.	2005-04-27

I have to say I liked this, the premise had me worried at the beginning, combos of high-tech and medeval do not tend to work out well but this was done fantastically.  Probably because they don't exist together as such, but I digress.  I truely liked the use of aliens in this book, they weren't over exaggerated or super powerful, they just existed and were part of the whole, not a great mystery or fearsome monsters.  I also liked the story, I started it with a wow, got another wow, laughed as my first wow wasn't such a big deal, then wowwed again as it turned out that it was!  (not giving any plot here, but the scope of the story seemed to get bigger and bigger as it went, it worked for me)  I thought the ideas were fantastic, so was the writing, though maybe a little dry.  The only part was the love story, which...  I didn't care about, but the rest rocked!  I have to give it 5/5, it's one of the best sci-fi I've read.	2005-01-23

He has a way of writing that isn't totally neutral but not biased, it's intriguing and clear.  There's no flowery prose in his writing but it's certainly not dry, it's exciting and real.  The story of a thug who terrorized a country is amazing, how does a guy get a country to live in fear?  well, simple.  Be ruthless.  Someone giving you a problem?  Kill his sister.  Still bothering you, blow up his house.  Still?  Kill him.  Government?  Kill the judges.  Not giving up?  random car bombs.  Still after you? bribes...  just wow.  anyways, not telling all here, but this guy was something, and it's not surprising that he lasted for so long.  I thought the book was really engrossing, eye opening and exciting.  Though I did think the end was a little dragged out, it was a very good read.	2004-12-07

The idea was good, the characters were good, it was well paced, not rushed, yet not over explained/dragged.  The situation was set up well, it wasn't overly gory, something I thought a little odd, normally you expect the gross out factor, yet, I'd certainly still call it horror.  Not sure if I liked the ending, but endings in horror books tend to be a Little bad anyways.  Certainly worth reading if this is your genre	2004-11-09

This started off as a really strong novel, it was quick to set things up, had some very compelling characters, great dialog, off humor, it had it all.  It created a great con game and set it up well, had you hoping for the cons, stick it to the badder cons!  Problem is, you're over 1/2 way through the book and things are still being set up, doesn't leave much room left for the conclusion...  which was, surprise, rushed.  I don't know if he was pressed for time, got fed up writing, the cab was out there waiting for him or what, but after such a great set up and things start rolling, it just flew through the last bit.  Guess it was to show that it all happened quickly, but still... disappointing.  It's well worth reading, maybe deserves more stars but that just a bit of a let down to me.	2004-10-12

It's kinda hard to say this is a recommendation for people to read, it's GROSS, unsettling and repulsive.  Yet, I enjoyed this book.  The humor is... off, but I laughed, a lot more than maybe I should have, but it was funny.  It's certainly researched, it's informative, we all will suffer from it, so why not read about it.  I've read horror books and true crime and other genres, but this is the only book that I read that made my shudder, but then, afterwards, wow, that's interesting. I had to read it for the \\"see how much I can take\\" kinda thing, but the humor off set it enough to be ok.  Not that I'm overly squimish, but still, with things likee 30 heads on trays was kinda unsettling	2004-09-22

I have to say this is one of the best thrillers I have ever read, I'm sure you've heard that before, but I was genuinely interested in what was going to happen.  <BR>I thought the story was excellent, I thought the characters were excellent, I thought the descriptions were excellent.  It was detailed enough that you got the inside of police work but not so much that it dragged the book down, the back ground story of Caffery was well developed and very interesting, and how it all came together was very well done.  The only problem? I had with the book was...  the killer.  When it came down to who it was, well, I was less than enthused, but, I didn't care, the rest of the book was more than strong enough to carry on.  I didn't care who it was, but what they did and how and to who, and the chase and the detective's story and and and and...<BR>I certainly recommend it, but I suggest reading Birdman to get more of the story on Caffery and how it back fills (more on his current girlfriend and how that came about as well as his obsession).	2004-04-15

This was a great book to read, after the first 3 pages I felt myself being drawn into it, and I could see it happening, but I was drawn in anyways.  Twisted little story with characters with a LOT of depth and kind of bizarre, but not to the point of over done, this was a fun and humorous read.  While the characters are extreme in situation, they have a certain common feel, that you (or, at least I) can relate family with.  The story is fast paced, humorous, and has some good points made about the world, well worth reading.  The only issue I had with it was that it was kind of short, everything moves at a good pace and extra in it would probably destroy that, but you still want more.	2003-11-10

I finished it, and I can't say I hated it, but I wasn't rushing home to finish it either.  Interstellar war, spies, con artists, mammoth space ships and a thinking black hole...  sounds like it could've been something, but... no, didn't work.  The strange thing is that the characters were done pretty good, just the story was boring.  Scientist spy is sent to investigate enemy's black hole, and... he does.  Meets interesting people along the way.  Ta-da.  The war is a side story, no sense of panic or really anything, it's happening.  The con-artist is the love interest and almost works, yet, doesn't.  The battle ship is under utilized, nice side story, but yet unimpressive.  The black hole was, well, just there.  I never got involved in this book, everything was ok but not exciting.  Did like the space travel concept though.	2003-10-22

BORING, just plain boring.  <br />It's hard to write a bad review of this book, it's well structured, it has some really good jabs at society and has some great black/perverse humor in it, all good qualities for reading and it's probably worth reading just for that.  But it has main characters that I just didn't care about, and a plot that wasn't that complex but took over 600 pages to muddle through.  Also, after about 500, Atwood/editor must've realized she was dragging on, and kind of finished off the loose threads and called it a book.  And the last kicker, the great secret revealed at the end, very foreseeable.<br />oh well, wasn't a complete waste, but less than I expected	2003-02-10

Told from several journal entries of different characters, it is an enthralling book of amazingly vivid character devolopment.  While it's a fairly simple story by itself, the back drop of Australia gives us some deeper story of it's punishment system and of the destruction of it's natives.  (I'm trying not to give away too much plot here).  The interpersonal relationships of this book is what makes it great.  Peevay and his mother, the Captain and crew and, my favorite, doctor vs cleric are all really fascinating in thier interactions and views.  <br />Though I really liked this novel, it did have what seemed to be a rushed ending.  Almost like Kneale got to a point where he felt he had his characters explained/visualized enough, he then just briskly went through what was left of the story. Just as you got used to this style of understanding these people through their inner thoughts, he kind of stopped giving them and just went on with the story.  The journal entries were no longer deep personal entries around events, now they were event entries with comments.  <br />Still, this isn't a down fall, just that it's noticable.  It is still well worth the reading.	2002-06-06

I always like it when I read something technical and don't have to have a PhD to understand what is being said.  Paulos gets his point of 'innumeracy' across very well and by using some fairly easy math, shows that it isn't that bad.  Well written and to the point, a good read for the average person to understand some basic probability.  I did have some, I guess, issues with the book.  I found that the actual consequences of an innumerate society were lacking.  Yes people don't understand the stats thrown at them every day by media, gov't, even in their jobs, but what's the devastating effects of it.  He does go into this somewhat but the emphasis of the book was on the math and not really the effects of lack of understanding.  The other issue I had was that he keeps talking about stats.  Yes this is a weak area in people today, but if people can't do the basics of adding and multipling, then they can't figure out the stats.  Maybe his attack was too high?  But all in all, a good book and recommended reading.	2002-05-07

It's pretty interesting, the retelling of the mysteriuos events, but Keel doesn't sensationize them, which leads to a fairly dry book.  You can see why he stands out in his field, he's experienced these things but doesn't over embelish, draw conclusions, or try to start a religion of belief, just says this happened, and this, and that, and so on.  So, while I liked the 'hard' facts, it's told in a way that loses interest.  Also in the telling, he 'jumps' around a lot, here's one on day 1, here's one on day 20, here's a continuation of day 1 on day 5, etc.  It's hard to stay focused on what's happening or what he is trying to do.  It's not a bad book, just depends on what you're looking for.	2002-04-20

Burke is a great character, hard nosed, mean when has to, holds back nothing, really hard boiled.  Vachss describes nasty characters and situations in a fantastic way, you can feel your disgust for them and even some for the society that allows this stuff to happen.  Problem is, about 75% of this book isn't about that, it's about Belle, and while she isn't a bad character, she's not the reason to read a Burke book.  I found this book to be over sexed and under nasty for one of this series.  The characters where good, the outline of the story was good, but the focus was wrong.  Read it if you're going through all the series, but don't make it your first one.	2002-04-20

It has some of the characters from the first book, has the great in-depth detail as the first and has some innovative ideas on some of the problems facing Mars living.  An interesting book, just took a long time in the telling.  I found in this book, the focus changed from the characters to the science.  Red had some the best character detailing I've ever read, just wow.  This one seems less focused on that, more interested in the working of the biology, terraforming and political aspects.  As with other books that come up with great economic and social ideals, it spends a lot of time explaining the ideas which really slows down the reading.  One part of the book has a great meeting of all the factions and talks about the basic ground work for a Mars government, and gets into some of the finer aspects of things but from a reading point of view, way to much detail, unless this is what you were looking for.  One thing I will say for Robinson, he has a great way of scientific description.  He describes algae in process and function as others would descibe flowers in color and smell. Not bad at all.  But again, a long book, and requires a lot of focus to pull all the way through.	2002-04-14

After millions of people disappear, people come up with a theory and continue on.  There isn't the deep panic and mayhem that would follow.  Granted in doing so, the book would have become MUCH larger and they do try to describe it, but it's just a passing note really.  <br />Another problem I had was the characters, they just didn't appeal to me.  The writers tried to make them interesting, gave them back grounds, nick names, and interact, but they just seemed flat.  You couldn't help but feel that these weren't people, just tools to fulfill the roll needed.  Barnes doesn't seem real, he seems like someone created to push home a point.  Same with Hattie, though more fleshed out, she is still just an example of an 'average person' in opinions and actions.  The stars of book were also fleshed out, but not to the degree of understanding.  Then again, they went through a complete change in outlook toward life, so knowing them becomes difficult.<br />Still, it wasn't a 'bad' book, just the potential was there, and looks to me it was missed.	2002-03-11

Make shift hangman nooses I'm sure are not the easiest things in the world to set up, and one has to wonder about the amount of strength needed to do some of these things, but...  The only problem I had with book, is the research done.  While it's nice to read a book that has been researched, it's another to read all of it in a book.

But, the in-depth detail of watching someone's life is engrossong, and, by seeing some of the life-changing events, builds great understanding for the characters.  Eddie is stuck as a coming of age teenager even in his 50's, Ruth is tuff as nails externally, but is meek internally, forever worrying about her child and husbands, never doing the daring until she was forced, etc. You even see the gardener develop as a person.  <br />Widow is not as strange of a story as most of the Irvings I've read, but it still raises an eyebrow for plot.  Another farce of society's views, Irving satires normal life gone astray with grief, sorrow, and memories.  And, again, Irving writes about writers, and gives examples of thier writing.  I think that's amazing, to see your character you're writing so strongly as to be able to express charcters views though their writing... Cool.	2002-02-08

So, I tried Heresy, because of the good reviews and I'm ashamed to say, the cool title.  This book is all that I could hope for, quick paced, not moored in boring details, and interesting.  It doesn't require a masters degree in European history to understand what happened, just a general ability to read.  I know the book is missing a lot of information and, even to me, it's one-sided, but it works and I have some understanding of the life and politics of the era.

This was a disappointing Irving book, you expect so much more from his style of writing and humor.  Patrick is an uninteresting character who is flat and unlikable.  He is just watching the world happening to him, has little involvement with people and events, even though he is a &quot;news&quot; reporter.  He knows he should be doing better, with his life and job, but just doesn't do it.  A pity me attitude and world recognition gets him through life.  Toward the end he develops a slight back-bone but this is too late to make amends for a fairly boring story.  I think this had to due to the fact that we don't follow him through most of his life like Garp or the Hotel NH family, he pre-exists and we don't see his defining moments, so he lacks interest.  This book is missing the usual bizarre and lovable characters Irving usually brings (expection: the doctor) and I can't say that it was all that funny, except the concept of visitation rights (or lefts haha) to the hand, and the doctor's life.  He should have been the focus of the book.	2001-08-13

They are not the general genre of horror, there's no full scale slaughter or people dangling anywhere but are eerie stories full of suspense.  Some are a bit wordy, not as in diction, but as in over explaining the scene.  This helps build the suspense most of the time, but in a few of the stories it slows things down a little too much.  Blackwood has a great style for setting vivid backgrounds and characters that make his stories just so readableand and likable, that I think most people will like it.	2001-08-02

And, as usual, the book is better.  Palahnuik's book is a great social commentary on the spiritual void of today and his views on how people can find self fulfillment in self destruction has an uncanny appeal to it.  Who wants to die without any scars?  People want to do something with they're lives, and waiting tables is less than something.  So, through self infliction you can find self identification.  Palahnuik's book is full of humor such as Joe and his various organs and where/how they make the soap, just a big smirk the whole way through.  Also there's a final irony in that a book that talks so much about being more than your possessions, you 'chuck' out over $10 for it, and it's a little more than a short story (200 pages, fairly large type, simple sentence structures and alot of the stuff you read at the beginning is repeated later) which is a final kicker, laugh at yourself.	2001-07-30

A well thought out book of Dracula's quest for new lands and those who oppose him (though not for humanity but for their own wants).  Stoker was well ahead of his time in the telling of this story.  The use of journals, memos, etc. not only tells the story but is a great way to develop characters, their perceptions, thinking, personal views, etc.  Just an amazing simple but powerful idea that is hard to follow even to this day.  A different way to read something, but still enjoyable.  And unlike most horror books, Stoker shows Dracula's power by implying, not really showing.  Dracula creates fogs, changes forms, climbs spider-like down walls, etc, but does little in confrontations, he runs, showing his fears dispite his power.  Some of the concepts were well thought out too, like the weak minded (insane) being throlls to evil powers and the taking of innocence/blood leading to damnation.  Cool.  I also liked that even though it an older book, it doesn't suffer (much) from over dramatization that is normally associated with older stuff, it's fairly fast paced and enjoyable and well worth reading.<br />It's a shame to see such a great book turned into so many bad movies.	2001-06-29
US	44896721	R3D4PKYFT16OBS	034540047X	388275186	The Hotel New Hampshire	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Tragically amusing	This is my second Irving, and I guess I'm going to have to read all the others.  This one wasn't as good as Garp (thus 4 stars) but still a very good read.  Irving creates some of the most fascinating characters I have ever read, just really understandable yet dynamic.  Take that, add an interesting but strange story and lots of 'sorrow' you get an amazing read that leaves you bewildered but amused.  Irving's most amazing talent is to turn tragedy into humor (sorrow floats) but not being overly flippant or mocking about it.  He take serious topics and while being serious about it, shows some of the stranger/amusing aspects of it (politics of a rape help center?).  A really engrossing book, that is well worth reading.	2001-06-11

Then I started to enjoy it for it's descriptions and it's complex world you don't usually associate with OZ.  The Animal rights, the complex religious dogma, the social classes, etc. Really enjoyable and different, something to sit down and read for it's own merits not just because it's novel.  Upto the middle of the book.  Then, when 'wicked' went to the Emerald city and stayed I found that the book just dragged on and on.  After what I found to be a forced chapter (and a big one) I just couldn't get back into it.  The middle of the book annoyed me so much I actually thought about stopping (very rare for me) but I persisted.  The book did get better after that, but the damage was done.  Though amusing and some innovative adeas of the 'beloved' land of OZ and our 'wicked' witch, the magic was gone, leaving you wondering if it was magic at all or just an illusion of a good book.	2001-06-11
US	44896721	RONKZ6LEILZQ3	0451200152	728640065	The Town	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A good read but...	This was the first Little story I read, and was impressed by it.  The characterizations were very good (a char. has to be well written to be snobbish or a brat...) but I agree with some of the other reviews that it had problems.  As with most horror books, it had a rushed bad ending, and there were story threads that were not followed up on.  Also, some of the ideas were forced, like the Russian man's shadow and the child's femur, and some were just strange like the spoon found on the hill (???).  But if you ignore these small flaws (you usually have to for horror) it was a good book in general.  A nice light read with some interesting ideas for killing people.	2001-06-04
US	44896721	R2Q6M1OGSGSO1T	0440236169	504517515	Birdman	Books	3	4	4	N	N	slow start, but strong ending	At first I had the impression of this being another ho-hum detective book with a marginally interesting serial killer on the loose, baffling police, etc., etc. and for the most part, it is.  This book, based on the first 75% of it, deserves 2 stars, but after that, it got interesting.  The main story didn't interest me that much up to the last quarter, but there's a side story with the main character, his brother, and the neighbor that really did, just freakish.  There's also another smaller side story with Caffery (main character) and his current girlfriend that's just whoa, get counsiling. With these side stories Hayder really develops the main character, you understand him.  It's then that I started liking the book, and the plot twist that I have to say I liked too.  But mostly I read it for Caffery's character than what was going to happen to the 'bad guy'.<br />In general, a good book, just took too long to get there.	2001-05-21

Garp is just too weird, but so unfantastic as to be believable.  So full of irony and black humor, without being tedious, this book is a great read, you'll love it.  Irving is an amazing writer, how skilled do you have to be, to write stories for a writer, who you made up?  And in reading them, you picture the fictional writer as have written them.  WOW.  A seriously recommended reading.	2001-04-09

There's enough reviews out there so you can get the details of the book, I'm just going to give my opinion of it.  The books well written, well characterized and worthy of it's praise.  Salinger has teenage angst and apathy nailed, though these days Holden would prob. be younger, maybe 12-14.  I liked it and I didn't, the writing great, but I'm not moved by the character.  He keeps bemoaning his life and saying how phony people are.  Typical youth of showing how cool and knowledgable of the world they are.  It gets irritating after awhile.  I'm on the fence with this one, the main character is annoying, but he's annoying because he's so greatly written.	2001-03-30

Maybe it was my expectations, I bought this one because of the high reviews and classification of 'horror'.  I wasn't expecting the prosaic piece of literature that this book is.  Kathe's writing is very skillful, very visual, and I liked that, but the point of a short story collection is the stories, which I found to be terribly lacking.  While some of the concepts were, at best, mildly interesting, she does not persue the horror aspect of it, just the literary merit of the writing.  She writes literature in a horror background.  What does that mean, well take the example of the teenagers fishing for monsters in a lake.  You know the creatures are there and they've sent someone in to lure one back to shore, but the story is about the teenages and thier teenage lives.  It was well written, descriptive (of the teenagers, the van, the lake, but not much of the creatures) and well charactized, but the horror is a suggestion, an aside to the teenagers story.  I still can't belive I read the whole thing, maybe I was waiting for the next story to be worthy of all the book's praise.	2001-03-29
US	44896721	R3P2WBVPHL8VHT	0679781293	222744857	Flood	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Wonderfully morbid	Flood is the introduction book of Burke, a street-wise detective who understands the filth of the world.  If you just look at Burke by himself, you'd think him a low-life scum who works the angles to worm himself ahead.  An apathetic opportunist using people for his own needs.  Looking at Burke in the context he lives, he should be sainted.  Vachss' book describes the repulsive side of humanity esp. wrt child abuse.  He has a vividness of his descriptions of the 'freaks' who Burke sees every day.  It's hard to say that you like this book, it's morally offensive, but on the other hand, it's real, these kind of people do exist.  I liked this book, just fascinating in relating of corruptness of the world.  Vachss is also very much of a quip, in spite of the darkness of the subject, he writes these little one liners that are grotesquely humorous.  So, why 3 stars.  Flood is a just an ok read, disturbing, but just ok.  I liked the style and idea, but just not the story.  I found Flood (the char.) annoying.  BUT, I am going to read more of this series, this is only the first and as such, is prob. just warming up.	2001-03-28
US	44896721	R2HTZ1KVB5HS9J	0812589041	401439625	Ender's Game	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Yet another review....	Yes, I'm going to throw my two cents in too, and, in case you couldn't tell from all the 5 stars, yes, it is a good book.  It's well written, has good character development, is well thought out, well paced, and entertaining.  This book would have good 5 stars except (and here it comes) I had some issues with it.  First off, unbelievable.  I can take Ender being the military boy wonder, or Valentine the great writer, or Peter the great political mind, but to have all 3 in the same family and forever change humanity is a bit far reaching.  I think the military, having discarded Peter, would have killed him rather than let such evil genius run around loose.  Another problem was the ending of the war, is there anyone who didn't see that coming? (I'm trying not to give away the plot here).  And lastly, while the writing was good, it felt...hollow?  It was a very simple read.  Don't get me wrong here, I recommend this for reading, it IS a good book, but it isn't without it's faults.	2001-03-26
US	44896721	R2M9HWZJ9GPAD	0553560735	710568866	Red Mars (Mars Trilogy)	Books	4	1	4	N	N	WOW, but whoa	Ah, nice to fine a SF book with plot now and then.  Robinson deals with the colonization of Mars and the expectations of this colonization, both of the people that are there and people of earth.  I'll leave it there as to what happens, don't want to give away too much.  He is very good at his charactizations, you really get to know about 8 - 10 characters very well, almost where you can predict what they're going to do or say.  He also does descriptions very well, of the planet, the work that they do, the people there, etc.  The story is excellent, but it's not a heavy SF book in terms of science, the only thing that he talks about at any detail is the lighter gravity, which is not a bad thing.  A lot of SF books get bogged in the S and forget about the F, this one doesn't have that problem.  There's only a few issues about this book, one, and I got to say this is probably my problem, is that's it's long, like Tolkien long, a lot of trivial happenings, again good for character development, but...  The other problem I had was the ending, I hate it when books just kind of stop with no resolution.  This one just leaves you right there saying where's the end?  Still worth reading though.	2001-03-20
US	44896721	R206I2BY6XLXUM	0380729407	944543338	Something Wicked This Way Comes	Books	2	11	15	N	N	Not a great work	Two boys, a small town and an evil carnival.  Sounds campy, but it's actually a good story, problem is, this is not a good book.  Bradbury can invoke your childhood wonder of life and the brashness of youth and in that way it's a very good book.  You can feel the fear of the boys of Mr. Dark, but you also feel thier wonder of him and his show, makes you really feel for the characters.  The problem with this book is the semi-philosophical ranting, it was just irating to read, and he keeps doing it all though the novel.  I can take it if it happens once or twice, but the thing is just littered with it.  It breaks the momentum of the book, something happens, something else is about to, but first you have to push though three pages of these conjectures.  That's the other problem with this book, the building of suspense is just that he talks about something else for awhile.  Something is about to happen, and then he'll flash to a childhood memory, or moralize about society, or whatever...arghhhhh.  I don't recommend this book.	2001-03-15

Armed with a high school knowledge of physics, I decided to try this book, to see what all the hype was about.  Heard alot of good reviews of it, and rightly so.  I could follow the topics and theories discussed and was amazed at the concepts.  While I had some vague understanding of some of the theories, this certainly shows how little I actually understood.  Hawkings is brilliant, just in dummying up these concepts and relaying them as something so simple, shows his immence mental prowess.  It's a real joy to learn these things that you've read about and basically just ignored because you thought they were so complex.  Granted that he has simplified things but still the basis is there.  Here is a rare man who understands science and people, and can incite us to learn. Just fascinating, makes me want to read more about science, not just the fiction stuff either.	2001-03-13

Glad I did.  Every chance I got, I picked up this book. I was impressed by Butler's views of the future as a collapse of society and how it turns on itself any chance it can take.  And of the (maybe pagan) religion she creates. But mostly by the characters. She can impress on you the earnesty of Lauren and the fight in her dispite all the atrocities that she's seen and lived though.  A nicely written, well thought out novel with good charactization, definitely worth reading.	2001-03-12
US	44896721	R32G6SVEMI75GZ	0553287893	458314472	Rendezvous with Rama	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Interesting, but....	Good book, interesting ideas, very science orientated, but as such dry for general reading.  The exploration part and theory in the book is great, truely thought provoking, like tornadoes in a huge rotating cylinder in space and the use of SIMPs, super chimps for household maintainence, but the drama of the book, like space, is void.  Character development is not the purpose of this book and is treated as such.  Also the plot is not the book's basis and is....lacking.  They find an alien ship, they go in, they explore, they leave.  Not a Stienbeck by any means.  But in fairness, it isn't meant to be either.  An OK read.	2001-03-08

Leaving all the school reviews behind of foreshadowing and such, I really could associated with all the main characters and see it through thier eyes (except Simon, not much of a mystic myself).  I could feel the power trip of Jack, speak the voice of reason of Piggy, know that it's gone too far like Ralph, and mindlessly follow the masses as a child.  It's IMO, a real reflection of human nature.  READ IT!  As for the reading itself, kinda simplistic, but when talking about kids, shouldn't it be?	2001-03-08
