It is a psychological suspense about family secrets, heartbreaking love affairs, and most importantly, devotion to a young boy. Elizabeth Inness-Brown is a wonderfully descriptive writer whose characters are rich and complex, and whose plot is full of twists and turns. If you are looking for a novel with depth &quot;Burning Marguerite&quot; is for you.	2002-04-01

Her descriptions of food (dates, almonds, pear wedges, bread, olive oil, saffron, antipasti), clothes (gowns, quilted doublets, embroidered bodices), and Italy itself (Rome, Florence, Genoa, and Naples) are wonderful. I could not get enough of the twisted alleyways, the villas, the references to historical characters (Galileo, Cosimo de' Medici II), and of course the paintings. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the story itself. Told in the first person narrative, Artemisia is a somewhat flat character -- Susan Vreeland is unable to convey the passion and courage that drove Artemisia to pursue her dream of becoming a famous painter. <br />&quot;Girl In Hyacinth Blue&quot; sparkled. It was clever, intelligent -- a little gem. &quot;The Passion of Artemisia,&quot; on the other hand, is entertaining (the Italian words scattered throughout the novel were just plain fun: bene, brava, tesoro, poverina, la dolce vita). It depicts details from seventeenth century Italy marvelously (the reason for the three star rating), but ultimately, it does not deliver the dramatic tale about a woman who ignored the social mores of her time.<br />If you enjoy fiction published about art, history, and the lives of women consider reading: &quot;Tulip Fever&quot; by Deborah Moggach and &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; by Tracy Chevalier.	2002-03-19

According to seventeen-year-old Josie, Springfield is one of those places that &quot;used to be important but were now only good for being state capitals.&quot; With great characters (flawed and all), amazing prose, and using weather as a metaphor, Jean Thompson offers up a troubled story. This is a book that is driven by its appealing characters -- and not by the plot. The heat and storms of summer 1999 run parallel with the characters' unheaval and ultimate transformation. But the great prose is not enough to warrant a five star rating -- the plot is weak at best and the ending just plain silly. That said, her characters are awesome: Frank, Teeny, Yoo Hoo, Officer Crook -- I could not get enough. Also, her keen observations made for hilarious reading (I especially got a kick out of Abe Lincoln turned father figure to young Josie).<BR>If you are a softie for great writing, dialogue, and good character development, do not miss this book. I look forward to Jean Thompson's next book and will read &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; in the meantime.	2002-03-18

Mardi McConnochie deserves much praise for turning her curiosity about the elusive Bronte sisters into a work of fiction. She plunks the literary trio onto the island of Coldwater, a penal colony off the coast of Australia, where the sisters live with their unyielding father, Captain Wolf. Theirs is a life of isolation, with time spent on household chores, cooking, and sewing. Their fates are soon changed as each of the sisters grow weary of their stagnant existence. The dynamics between the sisters are important, and their quarelling and shifting alliances allow you insight into their different personalities and temperments. <br />The first half of the book is the most interesting and the elegant writing style is impressive. It is fun to realize that Charlotte and Emily mirror the characters of Jane Eyre and Catherine Earnshaw (both in acts and narrative style). That said, the second half of the book is a bit hokey and takes a melodramatic turn (lots of wind-swept hair, gasping, stormy weather, darkness, and screaming). It is supposed to be tragic but ends up reading as overwrought and a little bit silly (the reason for the three star rating). Still, this is a wonderful debut, and one that will leave you wanting for more details of the Bronte's lives.	2002-03-04

This is a vivid, intense, and ultimately overwrought book, about a Mexican Indian girl who is forcibly separated from her three year old daughter. Susan Straight has a whole lot to say about the plight of the illegal immigrant and those that live on the fringes of our society. She plunges the reader into the horrors of migrant labor with examples of violence, prevalent drug use, and sexual predation. Her characters are great-hearted people, with big dreams, but instead of focusing on the plot (how about some interaction between the main characters?!?!), Susan Straight instead chooses to hit us over the head with her thoughts on love, race, and class.	2002-02-27

John Colapinto's &quot;About the Author&quot; is a well-paced, well-written farsical tale. Its highly improbable plot and exaggerated characters are lots of fun, but I think it is a stretch to call this dark or clever. The author does a great job poking fun at the literati and his nods to pop culture are right on the mark. This is a book that does not require a lot from its reader.

Sometimes macabre, always riveting &quot;Year of Wonders&quot; is an amazing glimpse into seventeenth century England. Set in the plague-ridden village of Eyam, the story unfolds and is told in the voice of eighteen (eighteen!!) year old Anna Firth. Through Anna we experience what it was like to care for those infected by the plague, grieve for those killed by the plague, and experience the madness that overcame its victims (witch-hunting, self-flagellation, and sorcery). <br />Inspired by the true story of the villagers of Eyam and their extraordinary choice, Geraldine Brooks does a phenomenal job of recreating this piece of history. She uses dialect and description that will thrill historical fiction readers and vocabulary that is fun to sort through: garret, masty, placket, croft, whisket, gritstone, and boose. She provides ample detail of the time period and all of its horrors, but also allows for good storytelling and character development. Most importantly she captures the disintegration of the time and makes us hurt for its victims. That said, the ending is a bit too pat (the reason for the four star rating) but this is such a great book otherwise it is easy to forgive. <br />This is a perfect read for those who are interested in historical fiction or looking for an engrossing read. Enjoy!!	2001-12-21

Well.<BR>I heard this was a good book. <BR>You heard that? You heard about Allen Morris Jones?<BR>I heard.<BR>And you think I should read it? You think it's worth my time?<BR>I say it is. <BR>Well. Cough. <BR>All right then. <br />Does this writing style remind you of anyone? How about Cormac McCarthy, Kent Haruf, or Annie Proulx? &quot;Last Year's River&quot; is an impressive debut novel and one that will appeal to a large audience. It is full of amazing passages about the West (specifically Wyoming and the fringes of Yellowstone), dialogue that leaves you wanting (to throttle the various characters at one time or another), and thankful to live in present times (versus back when an out-of-wedlock pregnancy meant social death). My only criticism (and reason for the three-star rating) is that the plot is somewhat predictable -- especially with the flashbacks told in Virginia's voice at the beginning of the chapters. That said, this is a hugely readable story -- gritty, closely observed, and vivid. Add Allen Morris Jones to your list of serious western novelists!	2001-12-19

I was excited to hear that Elissa Schappell had a book out because I am a fan of her work in \\"Vanity Fair.\\" Also, I like books that have short stories or vignettes that link together (i.e. Susan Vreeland's \\"Girl In Hyacinth Blue\\" or Melissa Banks' \\"Girls Guide To Hunting & Fishing\\"). However, \\"Use Me\\" did not appeal to me. Much of the material felt contrived and gratuitous: the rebellion, the \\"supposed to shock you\\" sex, the multiple abortions, even the father's cancer -- I felt like a voyeur. Ick.<br />It would be unfair not to mention that this is a well written book (the reason for the two star rating) -- but frankly the good writing is lost in this novel (perhaps because it is trying too hard to be hip and clever!?!). Ultimately, this was a draining read and I was tired of Evie's self-obsessive, self-serving, and overall petulant behavior. Save your pennies -- I am sure this one will be remaindered.	2001-12-02

She hits every note with her graceful prose and in her latest book, &quot;Never Change,&quot; she has created one of her best characters yet in the self-appointed, fifty-one year old Myra Lipinski -- not to mention the fabulous characters surrounding Myra: DeWitt (the cantankerous patient/drug dealer), Murray &amp; Ethel (the ever fueding couple she takes care of), Marvelous (the name says it all), Grace the teenage mom (&quot;sorry for the swears&quot;) and of course Frank the dog (who gets to watch The Discovery Channel when Myra goes out). Throw in the most popular guy from high school Chip (who is dying from a brain tumor) and his girlfriend Diann (who is still cheerleader perfect) and you have the makings of a warm, emotionally charged, sometimes witty, and sometimes sad story.  <br /> &quot;Never Change&quot; is a book about the importance of connecting with others. It is about a woman who has been lonesome her whole life and is about to realize what it means to open herself up to love and to trust that others care for her well-being.

I first heard about this book through BookSense ( a great publication put out by independent bookstores). I had a great time reading it. The plot is simple: a man who thought his wife was murdered by a serial killer finds himself accused of that same murder eight years later. There is lots of suspense here and Harlan Coben knows how to move pages -- but for seasoned mystery readers there is nothing new. I found I enjoyed the author's running social commentary throughout the story best: Medicaid, drugs, welfare, violence. Also, Harlan Coben's over-the-top characters are plain fun to read about: Shauna (the hugely famous, plus-size, lesbian model) and Eric Wu (the shell-shocked, war-ravaged, terrifying goombah) were two of my favorites in this story.<br /> This is the first book I have read by this author and I plan on checking out his earlier work. If you are looking for a quick, easy read you cannot go wrong with this book!	2001-11-29

It is a look into the life of a lonely, odd young woman named Lucy who has been arrested for murder. Lucy is, as they say in English 101, an unreliable narrator -- and it is in her voice that we are given details of the events that lead to her arrest. Her past which is ambiguous at best is revealed to the reader gently -- all the more horrifying once you realize that this is not the first dead body in her past. Also, she has the disconcerting habit of switching from the first person to the third person while telling her story (this was a clever touch as it allowed the reader to see Lucy &amp; her culpability more objectively).<br />This is a story filled with complexities. And while I consider it a bit of a shocker, I do not consider it a mystery -- the murder investigation is only the backdrop of the story. This is a well-written, page-turning, psychological thriller of sorts that leaves its readers pondering its implications long after the story ends.	2001-11-22

Unlike her previous novel, &quot;Some Things That Stay,&quot; this is NOT a compelling read. Sarah Willis misses the mark with this one -- even though she writes again of a seemingly unorthodox and dysfunctional family. Written with careful attention to the theatre and an actor's perspective, &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; does a good job capturing their mindset -- unfortunately it is not enough to carry the book. <br />This is a story that is told from each character's perspective and in the present tense -- this gives it a hurried feel that leaves the reader wanting at the end of the story. Also, there is much pathos here: a bored housewife re-examining her role in the family, the angry sixteen year old girl, a fearful boy, and an easily rattled and selfish director/husband/dad. Throw in a handful of personalities (the actors from a struggling resident theatre) and the backdrop of Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men,&quot; and it becomes long, tedious, and frustrating. <br />Save your money on this one -- if you are looking for a good read about a troubled family read her convincing and memorable book &quot;Some Things That Stay.&quot;	2001-11-20

In a gentle, easy, and non-threatening way this book teaches the importance of creative play, the necessity of daily routine, and the merits of creative discipline. The suggestions work and are easy to incorporate into any lifestyle. As the mother of a preschool child I found this book to be reassuring and comforting. Learning to use statements with the directive &quot;You may&quot; as in &quot;You may put on your shoes now&quot; produced immediate results -- as did limiting choices, which ultimately made everyone feel more secure.  <br />This is a phenomenal book -- it belongs on every parents nightstand, on bookshelves in our schools, and as required reading for elementary educators. I recommend this book to expectant parents, parents with young children, and anyone who values and understands the importance of a nurturing environment for children.	2001-11-17

It is told through the eyes of Lucy Fooshee (Foo-shay)-- an ultimately likable young woman whose passion for Billy Lee (&quot;a stranger with no prospects&quot;) literally transforms her: <BR>   <BR>   ... &quot;People think they know what love means, but they don't. Until you know, you just have no idea. You think you know, but you don't. And when you do know, then nothing else matters. Nobody in Palmyra knows. I've lived with these people all my life and now that I know, I can tell none of them do. It's like one of those dog whistles you blow and nobody can hear a thing, but all the dogs bark and whine and go crazy. And whenever Billy is around me that dog whistle is blowing and nobody else bats a eye...&quot; <br />Lucy is a character with many shortcomings: she is vain, self-centered, manipulative, fickle, and selfish -- but her witty observations about her smalltown surroundings are right on. Her voice captures the smallness (both literally and figuratively) of Palmyra, Illinois: its petty jealousies, their patterns of speech, the blatant racism, and the peevishness of its townfolk. I found myself cheering her on despite her actions. I empathized with her feelings of boredom, the expectations of her family, and her oafish husband:<br />   ... &quot;Everybody would say I wronged Bob when I took Billy to the Holiday Inn motel and laid in bed with him there, but that wasn't nothing compared to this. My real adultery is here at the window when I watch him work and I don't want anything else and nobody else and I know that I'll never go back to Bob and who I was when I was with Bob. I'll never sleep with Bob again, I tell myself. I'm not his wife anymore, if I ever was... &quot;<br />This is a gripping read about a young woman who makes the wrong choice early in her life. Lucy Fooshee is the kind of heroine that would make Oprah proud. Alison Clement has created a character who is flawed, spirited,and fun. Read this book -- you will not be disappointed!	2001-11-16

In a heartwarming story, set during the Depression in Alabama, she teaches us all about race, class, justice, and leaving childhood behind. <br />I read this book every other year or so and it just gets better with each reading. I particularly enjoyed my last reading having just finished Melany Neilson's &quot;Persia Cafe.&quot; It is a similar story except that its hero is a young woman named Franny. Both Atticus and Franny are exceptional people who follow their conscience and are rewarded. Also, Leif Enger's &quot;Peace Like A River&quot; has a character that reminded me of Scout. Her name is Swede and she is utterly charming. <br />It is wonderful to be reminded of my favorite characters in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; through reading some of the great contemporary fiction that is out there today. If you liked &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; (and how could you not?!) I would highly recommend either of the two novels previously mentioned in this review.	2001-11-16

This is a wholly predictable read -- even the epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter are telling. Also, it has a &quot;Wings Of A Dove&quot; feel to it -- you cannot believe at what lengths these characters will go to in order to get what they want. <br />Ultimately, this is a story that is in the same vein as Tracy Chevalier's &quot;Girl With A Pearl Earring&quot; and Susan Vreeland's &quot;Girl In Hyacinth Blue,&quot; the difference being &quot;Tulip Fever&quot; is a much lighter read (I hesitate to label it a &quot;Romance,&quot; but...). The descriptions about life in Amsterdam during this time period are interesting and the &quot;tulip fever&quot; that infected so many of its citizens is a clever backdrop -- it mirrors the frenzy of Sophia and Jan's actions brilliantly. <br />This is a great book for those who enjoy historical fiction or are looking for a quick, easy read about a doomed love affair.	2001-11-13

I always look forward to a good book about female friendships and when I read that Anita Diamant had a new book out on the subject I was so excited -- I really enjoyed &quot;The Red Tent&quot; and recommended it to friends and family. Unfortunately, I will not be doing the same for &quot;Good Harbor: A Novel.&quot;<br />Unlike &quot;The Red Tent&quot; this book is not well-written. The dialogue was terrible (especially painful during Joyce and Kathleen's &quot;peeing contest&quot;) and the pace of the book was sometimes tedious. Also, as the two women shared their personal histories with one another I was often uninterested -- even though the topics were important ones: faith, death, illness, parenthood, guilt, and marriage problems. <br />Part of &quot;The Red Tent's&quot; success was its ability to make us all want more out of our friendships with women -- it made us all long for the community, support, help, and kinship Dinah was surrounded by. And while &quot;Good Harbor: A Novel&quot; is a completely different read and set in different times, it fails to make me feel much of anything -- except disappointment.	2001-11-12

Their trust funds allow them to lead the kind of aimless lives that are often shown in the movies. <br />That said, I enjoyed the book. It had great descriptions about Africa (both the beauty and the horror), it had some political undertones (colonialism, race, violence), and an interesting plot. The main character, Esme is a mixed-up young woman who makes some questionable choices. She realizes the irony of some of her observations -- though seems helpless to affect change. She also has a detached way of looking at her life and her nonchalance can be frustrating. But ultimately I do believe she was interested in a certain amount of self-discovery and introspection.<br />This book is not for everyone. If you are looking for a meaningful book about what it is like to be white and living in Africa, this book is NOT for you.

This is a story about a young woman who is determined to do the right thing. It takes place during the 60's in Persia, Mississippi and captures the feelings of that particular time -- specifically racism, ignorance, and people uncomfortable with the idea of change. It is about murder, violence, betrayal, innocence lost, and ultimately redemption. <br />I felt for Fannie's situation throughout this book. It pained me when the people of her community shunned her, and I was grateful she used her culinary talents as an outlet from their ugliness. Also, the friendship between Mattie and Frannie was depicted so well -- it perfectly captured the underlying tension present in their interactions with one another. <br />I cannot help but think of Harper Lee's, &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird,&quot; after reading this book.

Mark Bowden provides us with a detailed account of the 1993 horrific operation in Mogadishu that resulted in American soldiers dead and wounded. Before reading this book, the only memory or information I had about the event were the images of two American soldiers being dragged through the streets by the Somalians -- courtesy of CNN. <br />I read this book at the suggestion of my husband -- and only because he kept after me to do so. I am so glad that I did! This is a story about bravery, honor, and camaraderie. All of which are borne out of utter chaos. Everything that can go wrong during this operation does: two Black Hawk helicopters go down, people are dying, soldiers are going in the wrong direction, and supplies are scarce. The information about the Army Rangers and D-Boys is mind boggling. The next time I hear that our &quot;elite forces&quot; will be sent into battle, I will be hard pressed to forget that though highly skilled and trained, they are probably not much older that nineteen, twenty, or twenty one. <br />This book made me a nervous wreck while reading it -- you literally feel everyone's panic. I was constantly scrambling to find the diagrams and sort out where the various convoys and soldiers were located.

Wow -- what an introduction! This is a story set in Japan after World War II. The subject matter is dark and it can be difficult to sort through. It is rife with symbolism -- the water imagery throughout the story seems to speak to death and suffering, danger, and even escape. This is a story with a lot of tension --past and present confuse, connections between events are tenuous, and the climax is almost too startling (there seems to be more to tell). <br /> That said, I think Ishiguro meant to leave room for speculation. He meant for it to be a haunting read. And, he was able to write this book without once mentioning the atomic bomb. Not once.	2001-11-09

And just because it is fun, does not mean it cannot tackle big issues: the impact that technology has made in our lives, what happens after instant success, and the importance of self-discovery. <br /> Caroline Preston has crafted a great story, tackling big issues with a light touch.	2001-11-08

It is satire at its best. It offers witty observations about both the French and Americans -- the comparisons are often laugh out loud hilarious. <br /> The characters were great and I enjoyed the social commentary they provided us. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in French culture, living abroad, or in the need of a good read!	2001-11-08

This novel is set against the Victorian age and does a good job providing historical detail about the changing times. The interwined stories of the two families had the makings of a compelling tale but ended up being too contrived.  <br /> While being interviewed for this book, Tracy Chevalier said she got the idea to tell the story from different view points after reading Barbara Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible.&quot; Apparently, she had to rewrite &quot;Falling Angels&quot; almost in its entirety. I would have been interested to read that first draft -- part of my frustration with this novel was its chopiness. I never got enough information from the various characters or got to know their thoughts -- they simply reported the events. <br /> Also, after listening to the interview, I could not help but make the comparison between Livy (&quot;Fallen Angels&quot;) and Rachel (&quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot;). Both were vain, self-centered, and had such similar voices. I really wanted to like this book, and I think had Tracy Chevalier stuck to her previous writing style I would have -- it would have given this book an entirely different feel and energy.	2001-11-07

The story is told in Dinah's voice and from the point of view of the women around her. This is a story about mothers, daughters, husbands, and sons. I specifically liked the details about the food and farming, social organization, and medical practices of the time. I was able to easily imagine the caravans, midwives, artisans, and slaves.This would be a difficult read for those who take the bible literally -- but for me, it makes me wonder what the bible would read like if it were written by women.<br /> This is a clever idea -- I like it when a author retells a story from a different perspective. I recommend Sena Jeter Naslund's, &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; and Jeanne Rhy's, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; if you are interested in a different perspective from either of the classic tales: &quot;Moby Dick&quot; or &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;	2001-11-07

I started recommending it to friends before I finished it. I think about Tamara often and wonder at her future. Did her family stay in Sherman? Did her father continue to put his art first? <br />  I was also drawn to the cover of this book -- like Sarah Willis's writing style it is gentle and ties in nicely with the story. This was my book of choice to give to friends in 1999.	2001-11-06

I wish that high schools across the country would use it, at the very least, as a supplement to their textbooks. It offers a different voice to the traditional history book -- and shows us the darker side of our heritage as a country. <br />Most importantly, however, it teaches us through clear and passionate writing about morality, fairness, justice, and equality. This is a fantastic way for a history teacher to reach their students -- I guarantee it will promote class discussion!!	2001-11-06

At best, it is a story about a shared friendship between two women over a period of about twenty years. Nothing extraordinary happens, no great insights, no &quot;wow&quot; moments. I struggled to get through it and was tired of both women by the end. <br /> I know I was supposed to be shocked to learn that Sally's father made his money through pornography -- and I was at first, but it became a chore to read about it again and again (did the author think we would forget?!). I like it when the author poses questions to its readers, but apparently Ms. Moody does not credit her readers with much intelligence.<br /> If you want to read a book that captures how emotionally complex and rewarding women's friendships can be, pick up a copy of Susan Kelley's, &quot;How Close We Come,&quot; or Patricia Gaffney's &quot;The Saving Graces.&quot; Both are quick, easy reads that prove the importance of women's friendships.	2001-11-06

I was not disappointed -- this is a charming read and clever to boot! According to Ann Patchett, her mother wrote this book to make a statement of sorts -- women heading into their late fifties and sixties still fall in love. This book speaks to a much larger audience though, and I look forward to Jeanne Ray's next book. <br />How exciting that great writing runs in this family, Ann Patchett's, &quot;Patron Saint of Liar's,&quot; is an excellent introduction to this wonderful author (in this case, like daughter -- like mother).	2001-11-06

It is a strange book though and not a happy one. I struggled with it throughout because it challenged my previous conceptions of Mr. Rochester. I admit though that ultimately it did not matter -- my curiosity got the better of me. Who has not wondered about the lunatic wife in &quot;Jane Eyre?!&quot; This book does a fair job at explaining the causes: an other worldly environment, an elusive husband -- both which contribute to Antoinette Cosway's/Berthe's (Mr. Rochester's wife) unraveling.<br />If you have ever wondered why Mr. Rochester's wife ended up locked away in the attic, then this book is for you.	2001-11-05

I read this book back in May of 2000 and I still think about its characters. Initially I thought it was a book about religious obsession, but eventually decided I was wrong, and that instead it was a book about transcendence. As the reader, you are taken on a painful journey and into the lives of the dysfunctional Naumann family. You literally experience their unraveling. This is an unsettling story -- one that gives you a glimpse into the world(s) of spelling bees (the descriptions were brilliant), Hare Krishnas (makes you reconsider &quot;moonies&quot;) , and surreal images (remember Miriam's storage shed?!).  <br />This is impressive work for a first time writer. I look forward to Myla Goldberg's next book.	2001-11-03
