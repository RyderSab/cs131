While there are some minor technical issues (i.e., the author does occasionally use the wrong tense), this is an great read and very enjoyable. I feel the author captured a time in which things were seen more simply, felt more deeply, and judged by criteria different than the world view we hold today. I empathized with Alassandra. I could believe the frustration and inter turmoil a bright artistic woman would feel in the rigid structure of her time. Her confusion and ambivalence was a good metaphor for the great changes gripping Euorope in the late 1400s.	2004-06-19

There have been several &quot;command line&quot; books published previously, but this book is by far the best. <br />The book contains a quick course in writing .bat files for those not already &quot;in the know.&quot; I liked this section for both beginners and old-hands who need to occasionally need to create quick command files and do not need the functionality of a full scripting language.<br />The various commands are covered in sufficient detail. The command include the basics plus AD commands and commands from MS's website and resource kits.<br />Highly recommended.	2004-05-14

This Christmas novella is Janet Evanovich a gift to her fans. If you are not already a fan of the series, this is NOT a good place to start. There are far too many references and inside jokes.<br />Did Evanovich pen great prose here? No. The story is far from the best in the series, but it is still very enjoyable.	2003-12-31

Unlike many readers, she does not allow emoting to interfere with the story.	2003-12-31

The Complete Far Side serves two purposes: it allows me to enjoy the remembered and forgotten joys of the series, and it also allows me to revisit the series the context of their original time frame. <br />Unlike the other reader from Columbus, I find the series as funny as when it was originally presented. Not every panel is fall down funny, but the gems will still make me laugh out loud and a few even bring tears to my eyes. <br />There are many Larsen-wannabes on the comics page today (i.e., Six Chicks, Cloer to Home). If you enjoy them, you should read this collection to see how the true maaster of the genre works.	2003-12-31

From the right-wing pundits to the totally superficial news coverage, the American public has not received a balanced view of the current administration. It is refreshing to see the liberals (BTW: When did liberal become an obsenity?) take some long overdue potshots at the right.	2003-12-31

I was very disappointed. There is a reasonably good story, but the writing is second rate. The are many technical errors. There are a multitude of needless and mind-numbing destriptions of minutia that do nothing to advance the story. This train wreak of a book is further worsened by the author's parroting of the far right's view of the world and his mindless jingoism. If that wasn't enough, 90% of the book reels along like a drunken sailor, only to have what should have been 50% of the book jammed into the last 10% of the book.<BR>Save yourself some time and don't read this piece of tripe.	2003-11-23

Stanch fans of Alex Cross will not care for this book. However, it is far from being a masterpiece. The characters are not well developed and the situations are unreal and contrived. Still it is a very good &quot;beach book&quot;. Fast paced, entertaining, and not too taxing. <br />If you like this book, you should read the Brother Cadfael series by Ellis Peters. They have a great feel for the period and are, frankly, much better stories. Start with &quot;A Morbid Taste For Bones&quot; and follow the series for an absolutely wonderful series of books.	2003-05-26

It is a playful romp through the stories, legends, and mythos that formed the mindset of 1200. The sense of wonder and mystery expressed by the characters is joyous. (Imagine spending an entire evening debateing the dimensions of Solomen's castle!) Plus it examines the making of history. Sometimes, is history only a matter of who tells the better sotries and lies? All in all, great fun even if you have to work at bit.	2003-02-16

Having taken too many exams while ill-prepared, too tired from cramming, too nervous, or too hungover; I have some empathy for the students in this very quick, very funny collection. <br />Those who think these entries are fake have never graded high school or college eassay exams.

Imagine a technology based on quantum mechanics that allows the viewing across time and space. First, there is no privacy and no secrets. How would society react to that? Second, imagine the technology allows the same access to the past. Did Jesus exist? Was Lincoln an idealist or a pragmatist? <br />Within this intersting premise the authors use a shotgun approach to examine/trivialize the environment, religion, and a myriad of other subjects. The book is not focused (a typical problem with many cooperative ventures). Also, the book seems to be written to a high-school reader.<br />An interesting story torpedoed by unfocused writting.	2002-12-16

He had a stable, happy life, until his daughter is savagely killed. He is safe in his books, his family, and his job. Rather than take control of his life after the tragedy, he goes on auto-pilot. He lets his wive drift away. His other daughters are drifting away. He drifts into an affair with a student. Not honorable but understandable. He even drifts through the enevitable repercussions when the affair is discovered. <br />He finally takes some control and does build a new life for himself. Not a great or even greatly meaningful. But, a new life with him in some control.<br />His wife reacts by withdrawal. Another plausible response.<br />I was not as put off by the sex has some of the other readers. However, it did not ring true or particularly needed by the story. In his affair with the student, I felt as though he was looking for the sex to give meaning to the relationship. In his second affair the relation gave meaning to sex.	2002-12-12

I have problems abetting his profiting from his crimes. However, that aside; this is a useful book. I am also put-off by his boastfulness.<br />A well-run and maintained network is difficult to attack. Not impossible, just difficult. The easiest way to subvert most systems is the weakest component - the people. People want to be helpful and too often are not aware of the impact of even simple slips. People are also lazy. They write down passwords, circumvent security systems that seem burdensome, and do not report obvious attempts to access system.<br />Mitnick show us that the most difficult part of any security system is to educate the users and to obtain their buy in that a secure system is a benefit.	2002-12-05

I do not know if this book was meant to be the final chapter in the Cadfael series, but it brings the series to an appropriate ending. Brother Cadfael's search for his son, the end of much of the series political strife, and Cadfael's acceptance and embracing of his clerical life tie up many of the series' themes. <br />A terrific series that transcends usual mystery genre's conventions and limitations.	2002-12-03

Ms. Peters depth of detail brings the period to life. The social structure and mores of both England in 1041 and the Benetictine order are a facinating contrast to today.

Those who think any one  book will prepare them for any of the new Microsoft tests are in for for a  very rude suprise.

It is also  suggested that any user have 6 months experience with the product before  taking the test. I used this book as part of my test prep and got a 900.
