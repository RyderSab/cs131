Briefly, during each planetary round, every kingdom or life-wave goes through seven stages of development on each globe. In the human kingdom, these stages are called root-races or humanities. The root-races overlap: a new race begins in the middle of the previous one. Each root-race contains the same egos that were evolving in the preceding root-race.<br /><br />As a general rule, a root-race lasts for two mah창-yugas (8.64 million years). During the first mah창-yuga, the race reaches its zenith. A racial cataclysm then ensues, and during the second mah창-yuga the old race slowly dies out while a new one emerges and pursues its evolution towards maturity. The fifth race in particular will last for two mah창-yugas. The fourth race lasted somewhat longer, the sixth and seventh races will be slightly shorter, and the first three races were considerably longer.<br /><br />CW Leadbeater through his clairvoyant visions, delineates his findings on this subject matter.<br /><br />Heady stuff.
