My only problem with this book is that author really focused on some topics and had almost nothing to say on others.  For instance, Ch. 3 on XML was very detailed and included plenty of examples to learn from.  On the other hand, other topics like DTS and Reporting were glossed over at best.  Overall, this is a good intro to using SQL Server 2005 new features and it does make me want to buy a more advanced book.  However, I would have liked to have seen a little more consistency in the amount of detail for the various topics.	2005-09-23

Do not buy this book if you are trying to learn the Primary Series from a book.  Although the level of detail in this book is great, Ashtanga is better learn watching/learning from a live person, or if you are really pressed for money and/or do not have an Ashtanga teacher near you get a good video (David Swenson, Richard Freeman, John Scott, and others have excellent tapes out).  With that said, this book is a wonderful reference tool and offers exact breath counts.  In Ashtanga,  every movement is associated with a breath, this book provides information on how to get in and out of every posture in the primary series following the breath (i.e. how many inhalations and exhalations should be accomplished moving between postures).  This book also offers great detail as it relates to living the yoga you practice.  While I may not agree with Jois' entire philosophy, it is a great deal of knowledge to be gained from this book.  This book is a must read if you are an Ashtanga practioner or teacher.  This book will help you deepen your practice both physically and spiritually.  I would also suggest this book for anyone curious about the philosophy of Ashtanga yoga.	2005-01-04

A previous reviewer mentioned that it would be good to have the Sandskit terms for many of the poses, which would be nice, but I can understand the rationale for having all poses in their english equivalent.  If you are a teacher, serious practioner/student this is a must buy, because it provides great detail about anatomical perspective of yoga.	2004-12-03
US	51692963	R1UZHW21MGBXSH	0345465415	919246679	Cool Yoga Tricks	Books	4	34	35	N	N	Solid Iyengar Yoga based book  more like 4.5 stars than 4	This book does a nice job of talking about and demonstrating many poses that people do in yoga classes and on yoga dvds.  This book is broken up into sections (standing poses, seated poses, twisting poses, etc) and does a nice job with providing modifications for the poses.  The advanced section towards the back of the book is also very good, and helps people who have a nice degree of flexibility (or who are looking for increased range of motion) to go a little deeper and try some tougher poses.  My only problem with this book is that there were not enough seated poses.  The book only covered Cobbler's Pose and Full Lotus Pose (I admit to being slightly bias because these are the poses I struggle the most with).  While these are great poses to cover, adding a few more of the seated poses would made this book 5 stars for me.  Otherwise, this is a great book, and I think anyone from any level or any style of yoga can get something out of this book.	2004-11-05

Scott's book only cover's the primary series, while Swenson's book covers both the Primary and Intermediate Series.  The big difference is the level of detail Scott offers with getting into and out of each pose.  Swenson offers three to four variations of every posture displayed, while Scott only displays the \\"correct\\" version of each posture.  While Swenson gives a great break down of each pose in the Sun Salutation A & B, Standing, Primary, Intermediate, and Finishing series, Scott gives explicit detail of how to get into and out of every pose.  Swenson gives pictures (and pictures of modifications) of each pose in the Sun Salutation A & B, Standing, Primary, and Finishing series.  Scott offers some philisophy and opening and closing prayers (similar but not as detailed as Yoga Mala).  Scott also offers tremendous detail on sychronizing the breath with each movement.  It is a more visual representation (but not quite as detailed version) of what a person would get reading Yoga Mala.  In addition, Scott gives the Sanskrit count of each movement of the two Sun Salutation series.     Overall, Scott offers a tremendous break down of the Primary Series, each pose is explained in enough detail to allow an advanced practioner to appreciate the subtleties of linking  breath and movement, while being easy enough for a beginner (along with attending regular classes with an instrutor) to read and gain a deeper understanding of the Primary Series.  The opening and closing prayers are good too (and not found in Swenson's book).  I would suggest using Swenson's book to see each pose and find a modified version (if necessary) that suites your skill level, while using Scott's book after you feel confident in your practice to go deeper into the Primary Series.  Again, this book is a great way to gain further understanding of the Primary Series and would probably make a great teacher's aid.	2004-10-08

However, I do not agree with a previous reviewer in that something is missing (i.e the yogis/yoginnis are not sweating).  I think that was the idea.  The idea is to get to a level where yoga is like breathing.  Do you need to sweat to breath?  For most people the answer is no.  I thought of this book as a demonstration of various poses performed at the highest level possible.  It depicted yoga as an art form.  I enjoyed this book immensely.	2004-02-09

I recently started using Linux 3-4 months ago.  I tried to install Mandrake 9.1 initially, but had problems with the KDE desktop.  I then installed RH on my Dell Inspiron 2600 laptop, and everythign installed the first time.  I have to admit that I did not opt for the M$/Linux dual-boot option, but the book does explain what you need to do to make it happen.  After installation the book offers chapters to first get you used to using Linux in console mode, and then chapters that teach you how to use the desktop to do the same types of things.  Overall, I thought the book provided a decent start to how to perform basic functions (via console/desktop) needed to make Linux work smoothly.  If you want something more comprehensive try &quot;Red Hat Linux 9.0 Bible&quot;, or &quot;Red Hat Linux 9.0 Unleashed&quot;.	2004-01-05

This book gives a lot of what alot of the other books give (History, Sanskrit Terminology, The entire Primary Series, some or all of the Intermediate Series, modifications to postures, etc.), but this book goes a little beyond.  A prime example of this concept is the abbreviated workouts (aka &quot;Short Forms&quot;).  The Short Forms range from 15-45 minutes.  I can speak from personal experience on how well even a 15 minute Short Form can improve your overall wellness.  In addition David Swenson's breaking down of how to properly perform a half vinyasa (the Up Dog, Down Dog, jump through after every seated posture) is unparalled, a very detailed step-by-step analysis that makes this impossible display of dexterity seem attainable.  Any person with at least a base understanding of Ashtanga Yoga, or Yoga in general, could benefit from this book.  In fact, anybody interested in developing an at home practice could benefit from what this book has to offer.  What else can I say, this book is really that good.	2004-01-02

I would not recommend this book for someone totally new to programming, this book references C, C++, and Java often when the situation calls for it.  The first third of the book starts out with the OOP basics (i.e. language fundamentals, classes, inheritance, arrays, polymorphism, etc).  The second third gets going with programming actual applications (both web and desktop), the final third gets into the .NET CLR (Common Language Runtime), which discusses versioning, threads, synchonozation, etc.  Overall, this book is a good way to start learning C# for the person with OOP experience	2003-12-29

I found the sections using CFCs especially helpful.  The authors not only tell you how to create CFCs, but provide a very useful scenario (using CFCs to hide business logic).  The book also gives some good examples of how to integrate Java, COM, XML, etc. into MX.  The number of real world type coding examples as well as the step-by-step how to approach is what differentiates this book from a lot of the MX documentation re-make books I have seen (see Mastering ColdFusion MX).  This book has a lot great information on everything from thre basics to creating Web Services.  Overall, this book lives up to the hype, and is probably the best MX book I've seen.	2003-11-04

My problem with this book is that it reads alot like the CF 4.0-5.0 books that I've seen.  The vast majority of the chapters are the same as the books befor this one, which is fine if you haven't used CF before.  If you have, save your money, and get the CF MX Developer Cookbook, or The CFMX Bible, which will give you more &quot;how to&quot; info.  You'll find the same how to create queries, how to create a loop, how to ...etc. type info that the CF 4.0-5.0 books offered.  Of course this book includes new info (e.g. using CFC's, new functions. etc), but there's not enough of this to justify the money.  Again this book is fine if you're new to CF, but if you've got experience with at least one previous implementation of CF, save your money, and buy one of the other books I mentioned.	2003-10-13

Primary does not mean beginner.  There are some beginner-level poses in the primary series, but the series as a whole is quite challenging.  I have practiced yoga for 2+ years, and I found this DVD quite challenging.  If you are brand new, or fairly new to yoga, and are looking for a good sweat, I would suggest Rodney Yee's Power Yoga, or Rainbeau Mars' series of tapes/DVD.  They provide a good sweat without freaking you out with the level of difficult of poses (most of the time).  However, if you are looking for a challenge, then this is it.  I purchased this DVD along w/ Freeman's Intermediate level workout, thinking I could try this for a few weeks, and move on.  No such luck, I'll probably be working with this one for at least 3-6 months.  The Primary Series a challenging series of poses ranging from basic warrior poses, to full handstands to rooster poses, and series of other challenging arm balances.  I could go on, and on about this DVD, but I won't.  I'll just say that if you are looking for a good 90 minutes of sweat and work, and want to learn/practice semi-challenging, to very challenging poses, then you have found the right guy.  The only negative thing I could say is that there is no music accompanying the workout.  However, you'll sweat so hard doing this workout, that you probably won't need it anyway.	2003-07-08

The book has great examples and how tos of everything from setting up the Cold Fusion Administrator to writing better SQL statements.  I particularly found the SQL statement information very helpful.  The author (Chris Cortes) goes beyond writing simple SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE  statements.  He gets into far more complex SQL like writing SELECT statements within a SELECT statement, and writing your SQL so that you optimize the speed of your queries.  He also provides good examples of the new query of a query functionality that CF 5.0 offers.  Cortes also offers great information on the proper usage of various CF tags and functions, not just telling you how to use them, but when it is best to use them.  Overall, this is the best CF book I have read.  However, make sure you know a little something about CF before buying this book.	2002-07-17

The story starts in Louisiana where \\"King\\" Tremain is still a teenager and goes with his favorite uncle on a raid of the hated DuMont property.  The situation goes bad and young Tremain has to leave town to avoid certain death.  Tremain joins the army and this is just the beginning.  His adventures leads the reader through France, Germany, to New York, back to Louisiana, to Oklahoma, again to Louisiana and finally San Fransico.  Tremain is a hard, determined man who is a highly skilled fighter who is no stranger to violence and death.  However, he does have a strict moral code, and is a staunch believer in family and loyalty.  Despite how he is able to evade death and serious harm throughout the book when it comes to dealing with his enemies, the same cannot be said for Tremain's family life.  In some ways Tremain's family problems are a result of the way he deals with the his enemies.  If you are the type of person who enjoys action adventures, where the hero overcomes all odds to right wrongs, etc.  then this book is definitely for you.	2002-07-17

I will not get into the details of the story so that I do not ruin it for anyone reading this review.  However, this book is especially good, if you read Due's earlier offering My Soul To Keep.  The Living Blood is the part two to My Soul To Keep.  There are several story lines that take place in this book, and it is particularly fascinating the way Due brings all of them to one brilliant climax.  If you enjoy a book with plenty of twists and turns, this book is a must have.  Due is simply the best, period.	2001-08-21

The only problem I can see with this book, is that you need to have some clue of what you are doing before reading this book.  If you want something that will take you step-by-step read &quot;Database Design For Mere Mortals&quot; by Robert Hernandez.  This book takes nothing for granted and goes through the whole database design process, from the first interview with the user(s), to the actual design of the database.

I've seen some of the movies (Hunt for Red October, and the a few of the Jack Ryan movies).  I personally found the book enjoyable.  It kept my interest through most of the book.  I thought the end of the book asked me to suspend my disbelief a little too much, but overall an entertaining read.  I thought the book explained a lot of the technical stuff well without boring someone who may not be interested.  The action was pretty good, and kept the book moving, and the twists kept things interesting.  This may have been my first Clancy novel, but it certainly will not be my last.	2001-06-19

Hilton begins having trouble distinguishing his &quot;dreams&quot; from reality as the two start to meld together.

Sometimes when a book has been given a high rating by an over whelming number of people, my inclination is to be a little suspicious.  However, this book is worth every penny.  I learned something almost immediately reading this book.  What I liked most about this book is the fact that you do not have to read one chapter to understand another one.  The examples in this book do work, and I have used a few as a guide to real life problems.  Overall, I thought that this book is one of the best T-SQL books out there.  If you want to improve your T-SQL skills you can spend the $... bucks for this book, or take a $2000+ class.  This the best book on the market for T-SQL period.	2001-06-06

I am impressed with how much information was packed into such a small book.  I have not taken the CF (ColdFusion) certification test as of yet, but I feel a lot better prepared for it now.  The chapters are loaded with good information, and are seriously condensed (no fluff, or unnecessary garbage to increase the number of pages).  The quizzes at the end of the chapters are excellent.  These questions are by far more difficult than anything else I have seen on CF certifications (i.e. the CF certification web site, and the CF_Buster test prep).  In addition, this book is a great reference guide.  If you are unsure of how to do something in CF, this book more than likely will tell you how it can be done.  This book offers a lot more than I would expect from a book that's under 400 pages.  If you want to prepare for the certification test, buy this book; or, if you just want to take your CF knowledge to the next level, buy this book.	2001-05-18

This book allows someone with little to no experience with ColdFusion a chance to get your hands dirty right away.  My only criticism of this book is that it could be a little more detailed on why somethings work the way they do.  However, if you want to get started coding solid ColdFusion programs, and develop your general knowledge of the basics of ColdFusion, this book is great.

I will admit that the book does have some very good information on JSP.  The code in the book is good, and the code does work for real life situations.  However, this book was a tough read for me.  I found that this book at times would drone on and on about some definitions that may or may not actually help you in the real world.  In addition, I wish that it explained more adequately about setting up your Java environment for a Windows o/s.  The book gives a very detailed installation on Unix, but virtually nothing for any Windows o/s, which to me is strange since most people have Win 95', 98' or NT.  If you want to get snippets of code that will help you at the job, then this book is great.  However, if you are new to JSP and trying to figure JSP out, or have a Windows box, then find another book.	2000-09-26

The first 100  or so pages are dedicated to providing the reader insight into the world of  database administration. This book gives some worthwile information on db  setup, and not as much specific information as I would like to see on the  actual job(s) that a dba does.  My suggestion is to combine this book with  another (Oracle8i DBA reference or Oracle8i reference).  Overall, this book  gives decent elementary knowledge of the world of Oracle, but unless you  are a complete novice to Oracle/dba buy another book, or look for something  more intermediate.	2000-09-13

Even though I did not care for the Sams series in regards to ASP, I  thought that the two Java 2 books I have read (Teach Yourself Java 2 in 24  hrs &amp; 21 days respectively) did a great job. All the code thus far  works (I am about 2 weeks into the book).  This book answers questions that  the 24 hr. book does not get a chance to answer.  This is pretty indepth,  and the format is pretty easy to follow.  If you like programming, and you  want to learn Java this book is exactly what you need to get a thorough  understanding of the Java language and its packages.	2000-08-22

I have to agree with the reviewer that said the book does get tough after chapter 9.  The vast majority of the code I've tried works. This book does a good job of getting you up to  speed on Java.  I would suggest using this book as a starting point and  going else where to get really indepth information.  As far as getting a  clue about Java, this book is definite buy.	2000-07-27

I would not suggest this book for a novice. It glosses over quite a bit of ASP. However, it does provide nice coverage of the primary objects used in ASP (i.e. Session, Application, Response, Request, etc.).  I think the  author of the book definitely knows his stuff, but a few more examples  would not have hurt. The book reads relatively well.  I read the first 7-8  chapters during a two hour flight.  I did like the way the author outlines  the collections, methods, and events involved with each object.  Overall,  the book was not bad, but do not buy this book if you are clueless (I  suggest Wrox's beginner ASP 2.0).	2000-06-14

This book did a nice job of easing one's understanding into COM.  I think this a great book whether you are a  project manager just trying to get a clue, an experienced programmer trying  something different, or a newbie.  This book is a solid high-level  beginning for learning COM.  If you want to have a better understanding of  COM, buy this book.  If you want to learn how to code COM components look  for a good VB, C++, or Java book.	2000-06-14

This book does a good job of orientating you to the world of COM.  In the process it does a pretty good job of explaining object-oriented programming.  The only  remotely bad thing I can say about this book is that it shows some  favortism towards C++ (too many C++ references and not enough Java/J++  and/or Visual Basic).  otherwise this is a great book for gaining  understanding about COM/DCOM.	2000-03-20

I tried the SAM'S series first (i.e. Active Server Pages 2.0 in 24 hrs and 21 days respectively) I found these books to have too many coding errors and  not being able to properly route you to an ASP environment.  This book on  the other hand did a great job of telling you what you needed to run ASP on  your laptop/desktop, and how to find it.  My personal suggestion is that if  you have the means of downloading PWS 4.0 from a network do so, because the  download takes forever otherwise.  I found the example programs to be  pretty much on the mark.  I would also suggest downloading HomePage 4.0  from Allaire, it is an excellent HTML editor. The book tells you how to go  about downloading HomePage as well.  I have had a lot to say about this  book because it is just that good, the authors do a fantastic job of  explaining how each part of the code works.  Some other readers may have  found this repetitive, but with limited HTML and no ASP experience, I found  it to be a God sent.	1999-09-10

I went through a little better than half of the book word for word before I gave up.  But I still use this book as a  reference whenever I need to program  in PL/SQL.  I would suggest this book to anyone who either wants to learn  PL/SQL or just needs to check something really quickly.  If you use PL/SQL  on a regular to semi-regular basis, then this is a must have.	1999-08-25

I have only gone through the first few days of this book thus far, and I find that none of the vbscript works.  I am not sure as to whether or not you need to have Windows NT, or not.  It seems that FrontPage 97 or 98 will  not accept much VBScript.  I know the author cautions readers that  FrontPage won't do much in the way of ASP, but give me a break!  It won't  do anything as far as ASP is concerned.  I sent an e-mail to the author,  and I am currently awaiting a reply.  My overall analysis of this book is  that it has some good information about ASP for novice programmers, but  this book needs an accompanying CD that can provide an environment to play  around in, because FrontPage just doesn't cut it.	1999-08-24

If I wanted a history lesson of telecommunications, I would have bought a book on it.  I thought I would be learning about networks, which you eventually do after 6 or so chapters of worthless history.  I could care  less how the telegraph impacted the modem.  To the authors of this  book...keep the history lesson and stick to the task at hand writing and  introductory book on networks.  If you have any knowledge about networks, I  wouldn't even waste my money.  On a positive note this book is a tremendous  cure for insomnia.	1999-05-12

Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find find this book to really be geared toward one type of database or another.  The authors had to use something, and Sybase SQL Anywhere was it.   I felt that the authors of this book did a good job of keeping the SQL  general, where it could be used on most databases.  I used this book in  conjunction with Personal Oracle8, and found that the basic commands are  the same.  However, after completing this book I would strongly suggest  getting a book more specific to whatever database you use. Overall, this  book gave me a solid foundation in being able to perform basic SQL  functions (i.e creating views, tables, understanding business rules,  etc.)and a great buy for someone with little to no knowledge about SQL.	1999-04-24

I thought occassionally some points were over explained, but overall a great book.  I would suggest this book to anyone be it an  experienced practicioner, or a beginner. There is something for everyone in  this book.	1999-03-22
