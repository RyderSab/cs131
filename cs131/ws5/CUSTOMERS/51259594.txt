Sometimes a writer becomes bigger than his writing, and his fans begin to believe he has let them down by not reaching a higher standard with each novel.  Well there is just no way to please that kind of fan.<br /><br />Black Creek Crossing portrays teenagers quite accurately throughout the entire book.  And even the adult characters come to life in his book.  I actually enjoyed learning about each of them, and tried to guess what there reaction would be to the different situations that came their way.<br /><br />This novel has a little bit of everything in it: witchcraft, alcoholism, religion, bullying, etc.<br /><br />It is a book with believable characters caught in a supernatural and scary set of circumstances.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

Johnson's knowledge of NASA's space program makes this novel have such a realistic undergo that I found myself forgetting that his is a work of fiction.  In this story, we are taken back to 1975, when an Apollo 19 mission (one that never actually happened) finds an amazing discovery on the lunar south pole of the moon.  This discovery challenges one of the astronauts to reexamine his faith.<br /><br />  But what I found even more enjoyable than a believable plot, was Shane Johnson's writing style.  He has sentence structures that flow, dialogue that works, and just the right amount of information with each scene or developing plot.  Just when I began wondering what the astronauts' wives were thinking, Johnson would cut back to the women and their story.  And, likewise, just when I wondered how Lucas and Shepherd were doing on the moon, Johnson moved back to events there.  Johnson has a good sense of keeping the story moving.<br /><br />  There are a few parts of the book where I found myself wondering where in the heck Johnson was taking this story, but it all worked out in the end.  It is a very interesting story, with a few unexpected twist and turns along the way.<br /><br />On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, here are my ratings:<br /><br />Writing style - 9<br />Plot development - 8<br />Believable Characters - 7<br />Believable Dialogue - 7<br />Suspense - 8<br />Drama - 8<br />Action - 7<br />Technical Information that I enjoyed learning - 10<br />Possibility that I am going to purchase another Shane Johnson novel - 10	2005-08-03

Vaughn's first novel has a little bit of suspense, drama, and intrigue in between the covers.  And what amazing covers they are.  The front cover of  \\"EVIL AMONG US\\" is one of the most eye-catching covers I have come across.  On the back cover is a synopsis that is just too good to put back on the shelf:<br /><br />\\"Evil moves among us in a never-ending search for prey.  Most of us believe we can protect ourselves because of our ability to tell the difference between good and evil.  Sometimes, however, evil unsuspectingly creeps into our lives through the routine, the usual, and the commonplace.<br /><br />That was the case for Jason Shepard.  Evil found him through the Internet, but he had no idea it was there - and no way to stop it now that it had chosen him.  Unaware of the horror and suffering about to enter his world, Jason finds himself engaged in a battle with a powerful but unknown enemy.  With his family's lives hanging in the balance and no sense of who he can trust, Jason must quickly determine his next course of action.  With help from unlikely sources and armed with his faith in God, he begins his terrifying quest.\\"<br /><br />I purchased this novel at a new Christian bookstore in St. John, Indiana.  The owner was unpacking his latest shipment of books when I noticed that Xulon Press publishes this book.  One of my favorite authors (D. Shane Burton) has published his novels with Xulon, so I was aware of the company's good reputation.  I'm glad I made the purchase.  I breezed through the novel in only a couple of days.  It was a fun read.  As I said earlier, this is Vaughn's first novel.  Writing a novel is not an easy task.  And self-publishing is a scary venture that only someone with a real passion for writing usually considers.  It is obvious that Vaughn loves writing and is completely dedicated to using his craft to glorify the One who gave him the gift of writing.<br /><br />I do not believe a professional edit was done on this manuscript, but who really cares?  Most editors I know couldn't create a good work of fiction if their lives depended on it.  And I was able to enjoy the story even with the minor amount of errors in the grammar.  There are a few places where \\"dividers\\" or \\"gaps\\" could have been used to make sure the reader understood that the \\"character views\\" were shifting or that third-person to first-person jumps were being made.  But the story was so interesting, the action and suspense moving at a good enough speed that any editing shortfalls can easily be ignored by a reader who's not obsessed by the Chicago Style Edit demons.<br /><br />The wild thing about \\"EVIL AMONG US\\" is that Vaughn's writing seems to get better and better with each chapter.  There are some really cool twist and turns in the story, and the reader gets to see the story develop from the viewpoint of many different characters.  I really like that about the novel.  I also like the way Vaughn painted (with words of course) a clear picture of the battle between good and evil.  In a world where that line is constantly being erased in the name of tolerance, it is refreshing to see an author who will not relinquish his Christ-centered beliefs just to pen a possibly more popular novel.  Faith-based fiction demonstrates how God can work in our lives when we let Him.  It reminds us that the God of the Bible is here with us today - the same God that talked to Moses.<br /><br />\\"EVIL AMONG US\\" is a 282-page creation by a new author, a man with a clear dedication to his work.  For a first novel, I think it's worth the money.  At no point does the story drag, and there are a few places where I found myself so into the story that I almost forgot this was a work of fiction.<br /><br />I'll end this review by posting Matthew W. Vaughn's  \\"author profile\\", which I found quite interesting:<br /><br />\\"Matthew Vaughn resides in the beautiful state of Washington with his loving wife of 24 years.

While the medication was being assembled, I had some time to kill, so I grabbed Cinderella Man off the book rack and began to read.  I couldn't stop!  This book is such a good read.  I enjoyed every single page.<br /><br />The story of Jim Braddock is amazing enough, but when a great writer like Marc Cerasini is added to tell the story, well the whole piece of art comes together, creating one of the best novels I have read in a while.<br /><br />Cerasini manages to bring the reader into the Braddock home, exeriencing the closeness of this family that experienced tragedy and triumph on a roller-coaster type schedule.  It was amazing how fast I read through this book.  I couldn't get enough information about this inspiring family.<br /><br />Cinderella Man takes the reader back in time, and in many ways, reminded me of The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck.  But I find Cerasini's style of writing to be a bit easier; the words seemed to flow right in to one another, and it was hard to pull my eyes off the pages.  This book is well worth the $6.99.  In fact, it's worth a whole lot more.<br /><br />Buy this book.  You'll love it!<br /><br />See ya next review!	2005-07-07

There are a few parts of Vitale's book that I thought his \\"spiritual way\\" was a bit different than my views on spirituality.  But there is no denying that this book contains principles and the necessary building blocks to become more successful in whatever one seeks to accomplish in life.  In fact, I think I may have the most amazing testimony to add to the reviews already posted here.<br /><br />For the past couple of months I was under a severe amount of stress.  I had a vacation coming up.  A vacation that I was wondering how I was going to pay for.  And not only did I not have money for the vacation, I needed a new riding lawn mower, major roof repairs, and had been looking around for a barbecue grill to purchase.<br /><br />Within seven days after finishing Vitale's book, I found a way to finance my vacation.  No, I didn't take out a loan!  I paid cash for the entire vacation!<br /><br />In the same seven days, I purchased a new riding lawn mower.  And I paid for it....  No, not with a credit card!  I paid cash for the lawn mower!<br /><br />Also, in that same seven days, I managed to use the Attractor (by the way, I don't think that's even a word) Factor to put a brand new grill on my patio.  We have already cooked out on it four times!  And guess how I paid for it?  You guessed it!  Cash!<br /><br />Today, just before I sat down to type out this review, a contractor showed up at my front door.  He had heard that I needed to have some repair work on my roof.  This man proceeded to fix the wind-damaged section of my roof.  He only charged me 175 dollars for his work and wrote out a warranty for the work that he did.  He offered to come back next summer and redo the entire roof for a reasonable price.<br /><br />All of this has happened in the past seven days.  I feel like that dog, Spot, Joe talks about in his book.  Joe bought the dog a leash that was three feet long.  Eventually, Joe bought the Spot a longer leash, but the dog was so accustom to having the shorter leash that he still stopped at the old three feet limit.<br /><br />In the same way Spot was letting his mind stop him from traveling farther than he was actually capable of traveling, we limit our ability to go after what we really want out of life.  We harness our own accomplishments, limiting ourselves to rewards that are far below what we are capable of.<br /><br />The Attractor Factor works.  And now that I have a better understanding of how to get what I REALLY want out of life, I plan on attracting success that I normally wouldn't even dream about.  When we realize that some things are out of control, and realize that control of our own thoughts is not one of those things, then we can smash through those mental roadblocks and achieve our true potential.<br /><br />Once again, one week after reading this book, I paid cash for a vacation, roof repairs, a new riding lawn mower, and a barbecue grill.  The Attractor Factor is a must read.  Though I wish it could have been a bit longer and a little less mystical.<br /><br />See ya next review!that he still stopped at the old three feet limit.

Five Stars For This One!	\\"Taking Heat\\" may not be a book that liberals and/or left-wingers will enjoy, for it completely exposes the left-leaning bias in today's media - and for that matter, yesterday's media too.  I guess a few, open-minded and less radical liberals (they do exist, don't they?) might be able to find some good in the effort, hopefully.<br /><br />  Former press secretary Ari Fleischer does a good job of summing up his service to the president, the daily struggle to perform his job to the best of his capabilities, and the general mood inside the White House during some of the most difficult years in quite some time.<br /><br />  I found Ari's writing style to be quite enjoyable, and I was extremely impressed with the fact that every single subject I hoped would be discussed in the book was right there in black and white.  Ari did not avoid any topic, and he also did not throw in some lame attempt to \\"juice\\" his book up by trying to make others look bad in the public eye.  He told his story just like it happened - the way it should be told.<br /><br />  I met Ari Fleischer at a book signing in Indianapolis, Indiana.  I found him to be a polite, articulate, and just plain calm and humble person; he's also a lot taller than Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels (most people are).  His book reflects his personality and warm sense of humor.<br /><br />  \\"Taking Heat\\" takes the reader right to the heart of what it is like for the press secretary to try and balance his loyalty to the president with the need to address the White House press corps with important news of the day.  Fleischer does an amazing job of uncovering the media bias against Republicans and conservatives:<br /><br />  Fleischer points out that \\"left-wing\\" activists are referred to by the media as \\"protesters\\", while more often than not, \\"conservative protesters\\" (of which I'll add you don't see a lot of) are labeled \\"right-wing protesters\\" or \\"conservative opponents\\".  He also makes it clear that the president's tax cuts were tax cuts for all tax paying citizens and that 65.7 percent of all income taxes are paid by people making 92,000 dollars or more.  Half the population of America pays virtually NO federal income tax, \\"yet they still receive many federal services and benefits.\\"<br /><br />  This book also addresses the media's intense focus on only concentrating on controversy, often even trying to create debate amongst administration officials where none exist.  Ari writes at length about how the press looks for the negative behind almost every story, ignoring many of the positive stories because they don't grab viewers and readers attention.<br /><br />  \\"Taking Heat\\" gives the reader a clear view of President George W. Bush, a man who believes he is leading this nation for a reason and that it is his job to keep America safe, even if that means taking a hit in the polls.  One of my favorite parts of this book is when Fleischer discusses Elie Wiesel, the noted humanist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and Holocaust survivor.  Wiesel said, \\"I'm against silence.  I'm against neutrality because it doesn't help the victim.  It helps the aggressor.\\"  I agree with Bush and Fleischer, it was only a matter of time till Saddam Hussein would have to be taken down.  I am glad we did it when he could not use weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />  On page 369 of Fleischer's book, he makes a great statement:  \\"...that man who gave $25,000 to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers will never again be in a position to give them, or anyone, aid or comfort.\\"<br /><br />  From the 2000 election to Ari Fleisher's decision the leave the White House, this book covers every topic I expected to read about - a five star rating it shall receive.<br /><br />  See ya next review.that the president's tax cuts were tax cuts for all tax paying citizens and that 65.7 percent of all income taxes are paid by people making 92,000 dollars or more.

This book tackles so many hard questions concerning the present and future home of Christians that I found it hard to stop reading and highlighting what I read.  Alcorn uses logic to paint an intriguing and exciting picture of our real home, the one we are originally designed for.<br /><br />  As Randy addresses in the beginning of the book, we believers know little about our future home.  The actual physical characteristics of Heaven and the inhabitants are not usually addressed from the pulpit, especially to the degree at which they are discussed in this book.<br /><br />  The following excerpt explains our dilemma quite well:<br /><br />  [ Imagine you're part of a NASA team preparing for a five-year mission to Mars.  After a period of extensive training, the launch date finally arrives.  As the rocket lifts off, one of your fellow astronauts says to you, \\"What do you know about Mars?\\"<br />  Imagine shrugging your shoulders and saying, \\"Nothing.  We never talked about it.  I guess we'll find out when we get there.\\"  It's unthinkable, isn't it? ]<br /><br />  Yet isn't that where most of us Bible-believing people find ourselves?  At a loss to explain the home we so long for.  This book is an excellent attempt at using scriptural truths to teach us about Heaven.  Back to the dilemma:  In other words, we have to choose to go down the same old road - telling people Heaven is so great that we can't even imagine what it is really like.  Or we can become more knowledgable about our future home, and begin to answer questions.  I think the latter is the correct choice, even though it might seem like a tough choice.  We spend so much time trying to bring people to belive in Jesus (with the Holy Spirit guiding us) that we barely have time to study and understand our restored home that is to come.<br /><br />  [ I will put my dwelling place among you, and I will not abhor you.  I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people. (Leviticus 26:11-12) ]<br /><br />  Do we take such verses to mean God will literally be \\"walking\\"?  I believe Randy makes a great logical case for much of what he proposes in Heaven.  He is an excellent researcher, writer, and of course (the most important detail), follower of the Messiah.  I have read most of Randy's books, a lot of his articles, and I find him to be a man who relies on the Bible for the basis of everything he does.  He also seeks out the sincere and Gospel following works of others to enhance his work.<br /><br />  If you have questions about Heaven, and I can't imagine you don't, this book is a great place to start.  Heaven is a book that challenges the reader to look deeper into what the Word teaches about our everlasting home:<br /><br />  Will there be marriage, families, and friendships in Heaven?  Will we recognize each other in Heaven?  Will we have our own homes in Heaven?  Will we sleep in Heaven?<br /><br />  Yes, it is difficult to know with 100% accuracy the answer to some of these questions, but scripture does actually point out some very important clues to help us tackle these questions.  Heaven is a well-researched, well-written novel that challenges us to learn more about the incredible home God has designed for us.<br /><br />  As an author myself, I highly recommend this book.  In fact, I highly recommend any book written by Randy Alcorn.  He is today's C.S. Lewis.<br /><br />See ya next review.(Leviticus 26:11-12) ]         Do we take such verses to mean God will literally be \\"walking\\"?

This book could be used to perform exorcisms on liberals.<br /><br />How To Talk To A Liberal (If You Must) is a great book.  I admit Ann Coulter is a bit abrasive.  But the one thing Ann is not is boring.  She is also great at uncovering the amount of America-Last propaganda that the liberals spew throughout their damaging careers.  This book, like her others, exposes the general hate, disdain, and anti-American attitudes of today's (awe heck, even yesterday's) National Democratic Party - the party of disarray and misdirection.<br /><br />I have to admit, before I bought the book, I did not realize the book is actually a collection of Ann's past columns.  And at first, I was a little upset, but then once I started reading each column it reminded me of just how brilliant this woman is.  Ann Coulter is a master-researcher, master-debater (at least on paper), and an absolutely beautiful woman.  I think this makes her ineligible for membership in the National Organization for Women.  The beautiful part especially.<br /><br />From exposing how liberals believe the only time a war would be fought is when a conservative judge is nominated (my own interpretation - not Ann's) to how liberals look to every other nation for views on what Americans should think about America, Coulter basically carpet bombs the liberal agenda with some great conservative (and just plain common sense) ammunition.<br /><br />This is a must-read for anyone who has liberal friends who repeatedly whine about President Bush, Ann Coulter, or Linda Tripp.  It is time for conservatives to educate themselves by reading all of Ann's books.  We are at war in this country, and thanks to cable (satellite) television the liberals no longer have complete reign over the airwaves.  That fact, and the fact that talk radio has taken off, have left the Dems and the Libs with a dwindling propaganda machine.  Once the good side (us) takes back the university scene, watch out.  There may be even more Democrats losing seats in Congress.<br /><br />How To Talk To A Liberal is a fun, energetic, and enjoyable read.

What I like about Henderson's writing is that she manages to mix just the right mixture of storyline and faith.  Her novels are not preachy, but they are also not void of the Christian message.<br /><br />  DANGER IN THE SHADOWS takes the reader into the world of Sara Walsh, a woman who has experienced terror firsthand.  She lives her life surrounded by walls, walls of protection, both mental and physical.  She also lives her life with fear just around the bend.  And when she meets ex-football player Adam Black, her life becomes even more difficult, for she inadvertently drags him into her abnormal life.<br /><br />  Henderson is really good at creating characters with interesting histories.  DANGER IN THE SHADOWS grabs the reader's attention in the first few pages.  I found myself really caring about the lives of the main characters, hoping that no harm would come to them.  As a writer myself, I am all too aware how difficult that can be.<br /><br />  The overall story is very solid, the dialogue is believable, and while there could have been a bit more action, I enjoyed this novel.  I consider it more of a love story than a suspense novel.  I am looking forward to my next Dee Henderson novel.  She has an amazing talent.<br /><br />See ya next review!	2005-03-17

And best of all, it jumps right into the intrigue when Dolly Bantry, Mistress of Gossington Hall, is informed by her housemaid that a body has been found in the estate's library.  From that point on, the cast of characters is introduced, and one-by-one they are added to the possible list of suspects - or at least people of interest.<br /><br />Agatha Christie uses just the right touch of humor and suspense in this book.  I consider it a classic that should be read by most school children.  It is short enough to not intimidate the average reader, yet long enough to be a memorable read.<br /><br />The motive and suspects are just vague enough to keep the reader guessing at \\"Who-dunnit?\\" the whole story.  The only flaw in this book is that the reader is never really given enough information about one of the characters - Dinah Lee.  Other than that, this is another must-read by Agatha Christie.	2005-02-15

I know, I know...what planet have I been on?  Well, I just finished all of the great works of C.S. Lewis, Randy Alcorn, Frank Peretti, etc.  So I am just now discovering some other great Christian authors.<br /><br />  \\"The Negotiator\\" is a well-written suspense novel that holds its own against the rest of the market.  Professional Negotiator Kate O'Malley's adventures and hardships make for an interesting story, and I found myself thinking it would be very cool to know such a person.  Dee Henderson does a magnificent job of creating suspenseful scenes that keeps the reader on the edge of his seat.  The plot, technical information, and characters are all very believable, and I can't see how anyone would not enjoy this first installment of the O'Malley series.<br /><br />  I did not give the novel five stars because I think it is lacking slightly in the area of dialogue.  The romantic bantering between Kate O'Malley and FBI agent Dave Richman is too simple...too fake.  Real romance is not so witty, so sure.  This is the only flaw in the novel, but it did stand out because the rest of the dialogue was very solid and convincing.<br /><br />  I plan on reading more Dee Henderson books.  She has the ability to weave together a great tale and adds just the write amount of the gospel message to her work.  I only wish I hadn't read this book just before flying out of Midway for the first time in five years.  Buy the book.  Then you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />See ya next review.	2005-01-18

What I found was the exact opposite - a look at how messed up society (around the globe) and answers that lack the deep investigation necessary to offer real solutions.<br /><br />That said, there are parts of this book that I did find useful.  \\"Why We Hate\\" makes it clear that America is actually doing quite well compared to the rest of the globe.  We definitely have our fair share of hate crimes and such, but compared to Northern Ireland, Rwanda, etc., we look pretty good.  We hear too often about how America is the worst country at understanding ethnic diversity and multicultural issues.  This book clearly points out that HATE is a huge problem worldwide.  In that respect, this nonfiction book is worth the cost.<br /><br />\\"Why We Hate\\" discusses pluralists vs. assimilationists (my spell check says that isn't even a word) points of view.  Towards the end of the book solutuions are discussed, but in many instances the authors of this book seem to have a slight left-leaning bias.  There constant criticism against patriotism and national pride can be annoying at times. I was especially disturbed by the last chapter: Flag-waving and Attitudes Toward Arab Americans.  The authors try an portray Americans who wave the flag as Arab-hating-redneck-morons.  But who is really the moron?  The person who believes we should strip search an eighty-year-old Caucasian woman but thinks people of Arab descent should be given a pass because we shouldn't profile, or the person who knows profiling just makes COMMON SENSE?<br /><br />I wasn't surprised to learn the authors are from Northeastern University.  The liberal slant is not so bad that this book is unreadable. In fact, I really enjoyed a great deal of what I read in this work.  I learned a lot of new information and was amazed at how many conflicts have taken place around the globe.<br /><br />Even with the slight liberal slant in this book, I would suggest people read this book.  I think the best way to avoid repeating mistakes of the past is to study them, understand the situations that got out of hand, and work to keep history from repeating itself.<br /><br />Writing a book is NOT easy, and I understand the authors worked hard to finish this nonfiction book.  But I wish that they could have eliminated some of the elitist-east-coast-attitude that makes them point out the Willy Horton ad while ignoring the ads that Ronald Reagan's opponent ran in his campaigning for governor in 1966.  That ad campaign made the Willy Horton ad look like a commercial for baby-wipes!  Pat Brown even told school children that it was an actor who killed LINCOLN!<br /><br />I recommend you check the book out at the library.

I have now had the pleasure of reading SILENT RESCUE, a novel full of intrigue, suspense, more information about the military and aviation than I have ever read in any book, and a plot second to none - the president is missing!  I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I will tell you Jones knows how to weave together a great tale.<br /><br />Mr. Jones experiences in the military (retired Marine Corps LtCol.) and flying make this a realistic read.  Matt Taft makes for a great hero as Jones builds up a near larger than life character (though I think Jones might be very close to the inspiration for this guy...very close) who has to take on a huge task - rescuing the President of the United States.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense novels.  SILENT RESCUE is a well-researched, well-thought-out action thriller with believable characters on harrowing adventures.  Don't pass this book up; so much of it reads like it could be out of today's headlines.<br /><br />This book also made me want to take flying lessons, join the military, and buy Jones' sequel to this story: A Chameleon In The Plumbing.<br /><br />Buy this book.

Answer: D. Shane Burton's \\"Black Storm Rising\\" - Book One of the Orianus Creation Series<br /><br />This book is a fantastic read.  The characters are unique and extremely addictive, from the planetary sciences professor Miguel Spieder to the nine-foot tall Marriotian named Broadcast to the mechanical wizard Zefram, the list of interesting heroes and villians is amazing.  Oh, can't forget to mention that one of D. Shane Burton's creations left me wondering what it would be like to own a \\"shaggy-ghost-bear\\" as a pet.  \\"Wugga-wugga!\\"<br /><br />The story line flows at a reader-pleasing pace, and at no time did I find myself asking why a segment of the book needed to be included in the novel.  Burton manages to piece together an amazing adventure on 372 pages (175,597 words, smaller font) - intricate details abound as we are led on a journey to worlds we've never heard of.<br /><br />As a writer myself, I realize the difficult task of crafting scenes for a story; it can often be the most complicated process in the creation of a new novel.  D. Shane Burton does a brilliant job creating scenes under intense pressure - the need to explain planets and surroundings we know nothing about.  I had no problem developing mental pictures of the verbal paintings Burton created.<br /><br />This book is a must read for any Christian fiction fan.  This novel allows the reader to look from-the-outside-in at the way religion has been distorted and abused, ignoring the true gift of salvation - a salvation we can never earn for ourselves.  The battle between good and evil is not your typical clear-cut, good guys wearing white, etc., but this story tackles the never-ending struggle all of creation must endure until the day we stand before the One who created us all - whether we believe it or not.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel to ANY reader.  It is obvious Mr. Burton put a great deal of time and effort into this book, and when you compare the word count to an average book, you just can't beat the price.  If you enjoy the works of Frank Peretti, C.S. Lewis, Randy Alcorn, Ted Dekker, Bill Myers, or Alton Gansky, you will enjoy this book.

This novel manages to address so many issues concerning faith that it almost accomplishes too much for one book to handle.  Mr. Peretti tells the story in the first and third person extraordinarily well.  The synopsis could never do the actual finished work justice.  Deadline by Randy Alcorn is the only Christian fiction novel that surpasses this Peretti creation.<br /><br />  Anyone who has struggled with their faith (I believe most have) will find this book stimulating.  I have experienced many of the things the main character, Travis Jordan, has experienced.  It was easy to understand and empathize with Travis and his struggle to fight for the truth without alienating the children of God he so needed to befriend and lead.<br /><br />  Brandon Nichols is one of the most memorable characters of any book I have ever read.  Is he Jesus, come back for his flock?  That is for the reader to figure out.  That is also for the characters in the novel to decide - and decide they do.  The Visitation is a novel that makes one delve into the heart of faith, especially his or her own heart of faith.  I, and most likely you, can relate to all of the characteristics and debates of the Christian faith: once saved, always saved, speaking in tongues, baptism, tolerance, etc..<br /><br />  If you haven't read The Visitation, you should.  Even if you don't consider yourself a Christian, this is a novel anyone can enjoy.  The characters are so real you'll find yourself comparing most of them to people you know - more so than with any other novel (especially with this large amount of characters).<br /><br />  The Visitation has plenty of twists and suspenseful moments, excellent dialogue, and a plot that is second to none.<br /><br />Buy The Visitation!<br /><br />You won't be sorry!<br /><br />See ya next review.	2004-10-26

For the most part, it is very unbiased and deals with just the facts.<br /><br />I found the book to be captivating from beginning to end.  So many issues are covered in this report, I could never cover everything.  But I would like to list a few items that the book did a great job of exposing the realities of the world we live in:<br /><br />Wahhbism and the hatred it teaches has played a major role in all that has happened concerning terrorism over the past twenty-five years.  This report addresses the rise of Wahhbism and explains why Arab countries supported these schools of hatred.<br /><br />The book explains the failures of our nation's security systems and what changes need to be made.  I found it hard to believe that flight schools in the United States are so unregulated.  I also found it disturbing that the hijackers were allowed to only concentrate on learning how to fly once in the sky.  The trainers should have realized something was wrong; bells should have been ringing.<br /><br />The report describes the movements of the hijackers before the attack and describes in accurate detail the terrible destruction and actions at the Twin Towers and the Pentagon.  It reads like a novel.<br /><br />Most of all, this report outlines all of the warning signals that were missed.  It does so without choosing political parties to defend or attack.<br /><br />I highly recommend this report to anyone who wants to know the true history of what happened on Septemeber 11, 2001 and how we can try and prevent it from happening again.<br /><br />See ya next review.	2004-10-01

Some parts of the novel are so disturbing that I found them hard to listen to (I have the audiobook and listened to it on my way to work and back).<br /><br />I understood some of what the main character went through, but there were many parts that I can never truly understand.  I would like to thank the author for such a moving piece of work.<br /><br />One thing: Parents, make sure you listen to the audio without children under eighteen around.  And I would suggest that this book is even too graphic for high school kids.  The one flaw in this book is that could have been done with a little less nasty segments...but I understand the author (Sapphire) was trying to \\"keep it real\\" and make the \\"pain\\" come through with honest expression.<br /><br />See ya next review.	2004-09-08

This book provides a glimpse of what the average Iraqi was thinking before, during, and after the war.<br /><br />McAllester has to be a little crazy to go after a story so dangerous.  I'm glad he took the risk, because I believe it makes for a great read.  His story backs up the atrocities so many have already reported; Saddam's regime needed to fall.  That is so obvious after reading this book.<br /><br />There are a lot of negative reviews on this book.

I live in Indiana, very close to the border with Illinois.  Our local news comes out of Chicago, Illinois, and since a large portion of the stories included in this non-fiction novel took place in the \\"Land of Lincoln\\" I was very familiar with a lot of the cases.<br /><br />As I state in my title of this review, I am pro-death penalty.  But I believe this book proves that our judicial system needs to improve greatly.  The stories in this book are proof that there are flaws in the system - as I believe there will always be, in any system.  The problem is that in many of these cases common sense should have stopped a wrongful conviction. It didn't, and Stanley Cohen does a fantastic job of pointing that out.<br /><br />Now, why am I still pro-death penalty.  Because I believe, as long as America allows the murder of the most innocent human life (a child in the womb), our justice system should be allowed to dole out the most harshest punishment available for the act of murder on those outside the womb.  Elaborating on this - in Cohen's book he uses a quote from Clarence Darrow: \\"There isn't, I submit, a single admissible argument in favor of capital punishment. Nature loves life. We believe that life should be protected and preserved. The thing which keeps one from killing is the emotion they have against it; and the greater sanctity that the state pays to life, the greater the feeling of sanctity the individual has for life.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't agree more. And I look forward to the day when anti-death penalty activists line up outside abortion clinics with their message of supporting the sanctity of life.  The day I see this happening, I will join the Stanley Cohen's of the world and march with them outside a scheduled execution, protesting the extreme punishment.  Cohen, feel free to take me up on this, if you dare.<br /><br />All that aside, Stanley Cohen's book is packed with a lot of great reading.  I can't imagine the pain and suffering a person wrongly convicted must endure, and of course, reading this book is not going to make me understand how it feels.  But I can say it has opened my eyes to how blatantly wrong many of these prosecutions have been handled.

US	51259594	R11T6W6IJ0SJIJ	0553580167	34846573	Gemini Man	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Good Read	Richard Steinberg managed to grab my attention in the first few pages with this well-written and crafty novel. I enjoyed the plot line and Steinberg's ability to only feed the reader as much information as was needed to keep the story flowing.  There was never really a point in the novel where I knew EXACTLY where Steinberg was leading me.<br /><br />I liked the fact that this book demonstrated the ability for humans to be formed by instruction and/or manipulation, which can lead to unbelievable changes and amazing behavior.  The American espionage agent Brian Newman makes for a great character.  But it was even more interesting to read about how the people around him reacted to his reputation when they came in his presence.  He is a man to be feared, respected, and quite possibly killed for the safety of mankind (or at least the people who have to be around him).<br /><br />This is a novel that delves deep into the recesses of government plots and the human mind; and does both very well.  This is a hard book to stop reading, and with a few small failures - corny lines like Newman saying, after six years of captivity, \\"I must say, I approve of the direction skirt lengths are going.\\" or the fact that the guards pulled back the hammer on their weapons, when in all likelihood the guards would have had hammerless weapons.  None of this takes away from the overall really awesome writing style of Richard Steinberg.  As soon as I finish writing this review, I am going to see what else this author has written.  I hope there's more out there!<br /><br />If you looking for a captivating read, you've found it!  Buy a copy, new or used, and if you can't find that, check it out at the library.  It is a good read!<br /><br />See ya next review.	2004-08-15

His mother is happy he made the decision to refuse service in the United States Army, his brother believes him a coward, and his father has turned to whiskey for comfort from the constant tug-o-war created by war.  He has friends who have sacificed more than he, but are satisfied with his decision to not go to war, and he has friends who never tasted true battle but despise him for not doing so.<br /><br />At times, I was getting bored with Ichiro's constant whining about his predicament, but Okada did a good job of easing up the saga when it was almost too much and then bringing it back when necessary.<br /><br />It must have been difficult to try and live in a country that believed you had to prove your loyalty because people who looked like you had attacked your nation of birth.  This novel does a good job of making one think about the struggles Japanese-American went through before, during, and after the war.<br /><br />Okada manages to create dialogue that is not so predictable it becomes a too easy of a read.  He keeps the characters in this novel above the routine writing style of most authors.<br /><br />This book is easy to read, thought-provoking, and contains enough fictional and non-fictional information to make for an entertaining novel.<br /><br />See ya next review!	2004-08-10

I have never read a novel written in the second-person.  That actually drew me in, just trying to get use to that style.  This novel is a true classic and does a great job of being very descriptive while keeping the story flowing.<br /><br />This is a novel about testing the strength of man's character and integrity under trying circumstances.  The main character is the sheriff, the preacher, and the coroner.  Three jobs that give one a unique look at all different sides of events and life itself.  It accurately portrays the human struggle during our most desperate times.  Very good read. I highly recommend any student of English give it a go; you'll (a little second person pun) be glad you did!	2004-08-05
US	51259594	R1A3U5DEWD3DZG	0312330111	896458248	Jack in the Pulpit	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Victoria Trumbull is amazing	Cynthia Riggs delivers one of the those rare novels that manages to combine a great story with a descriptive writing style. Too many narratives that provide vivid imagery to the surrounding environment, in which their story takes place, lose the emphasis on plot development.<br /><br /> The main character (Victoria Trumbull) in this fine work is a ninety-two-year-old resident of West Tisbury (Martha's Vineyard Mystery Series) with a sharp mind and a lot of attitude. I found myself enjoying Victoria's character development throughout the entire novel. She reminded me of so many people I have met over the years. Her stubbornness and bluntness make her a character who you enjoy learning more about. I think we all have a little of Victoria Trumbull in all of us.<br /><br /> There are three things I look for in a novel; this one has all three:<br /><br /> #1. A great entry. Jack in the Pulpit does that on page one. Bravo to Cynthia Riggs! A first few paragraphs that grab you into the story, and she didn't have to rely on profanity, sex, or a disgusting murder scene on that first page to do so. If your not sure what I am talking about - go to the best-seller fiction rack and look at the first pages of most of the novels. They usually have the &quot;F&quot; word, a murder, or a graphic sexual comment on the first page; not all of them, but a LOT of them.<br /><br /> 2. Characters who you would love to meet in person - if they were actually real. Riggs manages to do that with a lot of the characters in this novel. There are a few characters that needed a bit more development (e.g. Victoria's artistic renters), but for the most part, this novel does a great job of character development.<br /><br /> 3. Keeping the story moving along while it grabs the reader into the surrounding environment. I have a hard time reading anything by Charles Dickens because his writing becomes so descriptive that the story-line disappears inside a honeycomb of surroundings. By the time some authors finish describing a room, you forget why the protagonist entered the room in the first place. I believe Cynthia Riggs has found the perfect balance in her writing. I can picture the surroundings without forgetting why it is important to the story.<br /><br /> I don't want to give away the plot of this fictional work by going into too much detail, but it is a murder-mystery that has more than one story going on at a time. Victoria's granddaughter, Elizabeth, comes to stay with her after her marriage heads south. People in West Tisbury begin to die (no I'm not telling you more about that) and Police Chief Casey Casey O'Neill is forced to except Victoria's theory that someone is actually murdering certain citizens of the normally quite town.<br /><br /> Riggs vivid, verbal paintings of the beautiful surroundings in the backdrop of this story are second to none. Got to give this author her PROPS, she can be brilliant.<br /><br /> If you love to read, and you love to read a good detective/murder-mystery, than this book is for you. You'll find Jack in the Pulpit to be a pleasure to read.s. By the time some authors finish describing a room, you forget why the protagonist entered the room in the first place.

And since I love to read, but can't do that very well while driving, I purchased The Summons. I have absolutely been nothing but completely satisfied by Michael Beck's reading of this great novel. Yeah, I've seen some of the negative reviews, and I say dittlywash! The Summons is excellent writing and great fun.<br /><br />  This novel takes you inside the life of Ray Atlee, a professor of law, recently divorced Virginian. His brother Forrest is an amazing character, and Michael Beck does an incredible job of reading this part. I plan on looking for more titles by this READER!<br /><br />  The Summons has a lot of twist and turns, interesting southern characters, and an amazing southern charm. If you like mystery-thrillers, this is the novel for you!  Now, don't forget, this is my first Grisham novel, so I cannot compare it with his other works. Something I have noticed a lot of other reviewers doing. I can only be honest in saying, the audio version is the best audio-book I have ever heard.<br /><br />  BUY IT!

And this how I happened upon my first Stephen King novel. I must note here that if I have read a Stephen King novel before 2004, it has escaped memory, either due to aging or the late 70's - early 80's; bus number 20 had its own pharmacy. I have of course seen most of the movies. After Cujo, I refused to own a big dog.<br />Now, I think I need to get on with my review. The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower - book one) is a mixed bag, indeed. The novel did keep me interested as I turned the pages, but there were occasional lulls that left me searching for action; I guess that's one way to keep the pages flipping. Walking through the desert or riding a handcar mile after mile can leave even the greatest fiction fan begging for a Slow Mutant attack. But I understand, the gunslinger needs some Roland-time. I just found myself wishing Roland could find a Budget Rent-a-car place to speed up the pace.<br />The Gunslinger story line reminded me of Frank Peretti's The Visitation, in that I was constantly wondering if the gunslinger had it all wrong. Is Roland possibly the \\"bad guy\\" searching for the good guy? I enjoyed this \\"not knowing\\" who Roland really was - it made the story have an addictive appeal. In other words, there was no way I was going to stop reading until I knew for sure. I think Stephen King managed to pull off a great deal with this tale; as Booklist writes: \\"It mixes the Western, Arthurian, Romance, Science Fiction, and Occultism...\\" King evenly distributes the mix and somehow makes it all fit together. Bravo to that part of the work - BRILLIANT<br />On to the juvenile: I have yet to understand why great writers (yes Mr. King, I just called you a great writer - at least better than me, for now) must resort to gutterbabble (gutterbabble = the kinds of words, or series of words, that cause an eight-grader to nudge his neighbor in study hall and display his findings). Let's look at a few examples, shall we: [He suspected his father want to XXXX] , [ The gunslinger's genitals felt drawn and hard] , [the warm spray in his crotch as his bladder let go], and [ Beans, beans, the musical fruit...]  I think you get the point. Why, oh why, mix this stuff up with some of the extraordinary writing in the story? I know, I know, I've only sold a couple hundred novels and Stephen King is \\"da' master\\" at this stuff. But don't I have the right to wonder? Just say yes.<br />There were a few parts in this novel that I felt like King decided to toss in some shooting for the stars stanzas, like: [...hollow grandeur in the place of mean and sweeping passions which once might have erased souls] or [The lines and nets of mesh which held the last jewel at the breast of the world were unraveling] For a second, I thought someone had swapped my book with a Dicken's novel. Special note here: If you are ever suffering from insomnia, any Charles Dicken's novel can help - better than any sleeping pill, it is.<br />More Brilliant stuff: When the \\"man in black\\" starts explaining the mystery behind the universe, I literally got goose-bumps. Reminded me of C.S. Lewis and Randy Alcorn and the great writing they have distributed. Man does King shine on those few pages. I was going to write a short story about fish not realizing there is another world above the plane of the pond, but now I would be guilty of plagiarizing if I did.<br />Other great parts of the book:<br />\\"Only enemies speak the truth. Friends and lovers lie endlessly, caught in the web of duty.\\"  BRILLIANT AWARD #1<br />\\"They flew like rotten bananas struck from the stem.\\" BRILLIANT AWARD #2 (reminds me of my last bar fight)<br />\\"The gunslinger felt an urge to find a rock and brain the boy.\\" BRILLIANT AWARD #3 (and I have a new saying)<br />\\"But in the end, someone always has to have his or her necked popped, as you so quaintly put it.

Bush: Bush's spiritual journey and how it shapes his administration	Books	5	13	23	N	N	This Book Is A Great Read	Stephen Mansfield gives us a look at the real George W. Bush.  The Faith of George W. Bush was a great read from beginning to end; a biography that covers a great deal about a man who has overcome a sense of aimlessness and has risen to a level of leadership that has even amazed his closest friends.<br />What a joy it has been to read such a refreshing look at a man who has struggled to find his way.  This book made me realize how easy it is for people to misinterpret the 43rd president of the United States.  He is much more complex than we have been led to believe.  Mansfield manages to expose the personal side of Dubya with such poignant detail that it is almost as if we are watching the events through a time machine.<br />I was amazed by the rich history of the Bush family.  George's grandfather, Prescott Bush, served in the Senate for a decade.  He cosponsored the creation of the Peace Corps and strongly supported civil rights legislation.  He was a man of high moral character who passed it down the line to his children - and their children.<br />I was moved by the slow but constant change in the way George W. Bush viewed his destiny, right up until September 11, 2001, when most people say he became more capable than thought possible.  From his rough days at Andover to his decision to run for president of the greatest nation on earth, I enjoyed every bit of the story.  I purchased this novel because I wanted to learn about George W. Bush, the person, and I can honestly say, Stephen Mansfield has done a fantastic job at making sure I had that opportunity; this book is a great read.  If you want to get to know more about the man who has been found face down in the oval office, praying for our families and their well-being, I suggest you purchase this fine piece of literature.	2004-06-25

Duncan, manages to quickly hook the reader with a dramatic first chapter. From that point on, it was as if two of my favorite authors had joined forces to create a story filled with intrigue, great action, and intense dialogue. Duncan manages to sprinkle this tale with the same type of quirky plot shifts found in John Buchan's spy novel, The Thirty-Nine Steps, and at the same time create a mystery similar to Randy Alcorn's awesome novel, Deadline.<br />Shattered is the story of a woman who learns her life may not be what it seems. After Jenni Hamilton receives a distressing phone call, she is determined to find out if her husband has betrayed her. The author of this suspense novel is a natural at developing a believable plot, and I found the entire book a thrilling read. This paperback moves along at a perfect pace, never creating an overemphasis on any one creative aspect of fiction writing. In other words, the story does not become bogged down with excessive location descriptions or explanations of motive; it does manage to keep the reader intensely involved in the story. The goal of any great writer, one would hope.<br />I have read around three-hundred novels in the past seven years. I consider Shattered to be in the top-twenty of my favorites read so far.<br />See ya next review.<br />[...]	2004-06-02

While I can't stand it when writer's use the Lord's name in vain, I think John Steinbeck was without a doubt one of the greatest writers ever.  He has the unique ability to say a LOT with a small amount of words in one paragraph, and in the very next paragragh say a little with a LOT of words.  This novel should be read by anyone wanting to master the craft of writing.  Steinbeck delivers every time.

Could it have been written better?  Probably.  But these novels are not written by elitist English teachers looking to buck the establishment, so don't look for literary awards to end up adorning the mantles of Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.  These novels were written to bring people closer to the Gospel of Jesus Christ using an entertaining medium.<br />The first book brought all of us into the world of Rayford Steele.  It has been a long road for those of us who have followed this drama.  Some books we have enjoyed more than others.  I have reviewed most of the books with a positive judgment, based on the fact that Jenkins is not Steinbeck, nor should we expect him to be.<br />Glorious Appearing brings us to a more intimate level with Jesus and of course, His Father.  Certain parts could have been shortened, and some parts should have been longer, I agree.  But this last book of the series remained true to the writing style, subject matter, and character development that the authors have maintained through-out the series.  For that, I give the book five stars.  It gives us a clear picture of how the world will change when Jesus returns for His people; there simply is no denying that.<br />I will forever picture the antics between Leon and Nicolae forever and ever, not just in this installment, but in all of them.  I will also expect every little boy to be named Kenny Bruce.<br />Bravo Jerry and Tim; I hope to one day be as successful as the two of you.  It is my dream to bring people closer to God with my writing.<br />Peace-out!<br />(...)	2004-04-11

The Prodigy is one of those books that occasionally makes you say outloud &quot;Yeah!&quot;.  But unfortunately has a few moments where you say, &quot;That's it?&quot;  I think Alton Gansky is a great writer, but I think he needs to concentrate on the climax of his novels.  He starts off his novels with a punch so strong, sometimes the endings can't live up to the previous writing.<br />However, all that said, I think The Prodigy is an excellent story.  I felt the pain and suffering of Toby's mother through-out this story.  Anyone who wants to read a suspense/mystery novel written by a storyteller committed to his craft (not just after a paycheck) should purchase The Prodigy.<br />I would also highly recommend all of Gansky's other novels.

The main character is taken on a journey that leads him away from the boredom he was experiencing in London.  It is a simple first-person story with a very interesting writing style.  John Buchan manages to make the &quot;rookie-happenstance-spy being chased by everyone&quot; story work without a hitch.<br />I wish I had read this novel sooner.  I believe it is a must read for anyone interested in good literature and storytelling.  I felt like the main character, Richard Hannay, was telling me the story as he puffed on his tobacco pipe.  Hannay is like a man trapped in a giant rolling snowball...cept' he's enjoying the wild ride and ignoring the eventual crash.<br />Buchan made the suspense, the landscape, and the travel blend together in a very well-rounded adventure.

But this book is published by Pleasant Word (the company I trusted with my first novel), so I decided to check it out.  I am glad I did.  This novel started out a little slow, sometimes being a little too repetitive concerning the main-character's (Frances) alcoholic father (Guy).<br />That soon changed.  Around page 74 of this 214 page novel, I was whisked away by a brilliant, flowing story of a Southern girl encountering trials and tribulations which she thought might break her (I was beginning to think that too).  The authors, Frances Terrell Shannon &amp; Ann Shannon Jenkins, are to be commended for their ability to make this reader teary eyed one minute, and laughing out loud the next; a cow killed by a misguided airplane, a mother succumbing to ALS, a young son declaring dirt clogs Indian arrowheads, a badly scalded child, and a few big, bluish crabs trying to escape a scalding of their own, are but just a few of the happenings in this well-crafted gift to the literary world.<br />We all have stories to tell, and as it says on the back of the book, \\"Trolley Girl beckons the reader to look to their family stories to better understand themselves.\\"  A very worthwhile statement.  How many people watch soap operas and take mental notes on the direction each actor is heading?  Why aren't we that observant with the people close to us; in the real world?<br />Trolley Girl is a good read.  But more than that, it is an eye-opener; a looking-glass into the role each of us plays in this thing called life.  We can let our \\"little demons\\" seize our desire to love those around us, or we can make a conscious effort to rise above the hopelessness by believing in the only real hope.  I'll leave it at that.  :-)<br />[...]	2004-01-10

Ignore the extremely negative reviews on this book.  There are good reasons people who support socialism and hate &quot;conservative thought&quot; flock to rate Coulter's books with a dismal review:<br />#1. She proves them wrong.<br />#2. She proves them to be anti-American.<br />#3. She researches her work so well - it can't be refuted; their only hope is to stop the book from being read in the first place.<br />I don't think this book is as good as Slander, but it is more concerned with world affairs, or at least how our foreign policy was hurt by the LEFT.  Ann Coulter is still a great researcher and writer.  She exposes the quick attempts by liberals in our nation to criticize great leaders like President Ronald Reagan - the man who brought down communism with a \\"peace through strength\\" policy.<br />Ann exposes the hypocrisy prevalent in the media's reporting of simple successes by Democrats, while ignoring huge accomplishments by Republicans.  She sheds daylight on the dark-myth of McCarthyism; the save-all light-saber for the LEFT, especially when backed into a corner.<br />I say if you are going to buy just one an Ann Coulter book, purchase Slander.  If you are going to buy two Ann Coulter books, buy Slander and Treason - the two books compliment each other well.  But whatever decision one makes - ignore the whiners; they've been in the dark so long, the light hurts their eyes!<br />Peace-out!<br />[...]	2004-01-08

But the truth is, this one and Assassins really let me down.  The series had relied on action, suspense, and great dialogue to carry it from its label as a simple-written novel; this book failed on all three.  I still had to read this one - to stay updated on the series - but I didn't enjoy it much.<br />I wish the authors could re-do this one, but I know that's not going to happen.  All I can say is that with the exception of Assassins and The Indwelling the series is fantastic.  As I stated earlier, some have called Jerry B. Jenkins writing style simple.  Well sometimes &quot;simple&quot; can be fun.  I don't want to have to search for the deeper meaning inside every author's head.  If I want to do a crossword puzzle, I'll grab the newspaper.

Dekok has written a terrific novel based on believable characters, exploring an important topic to more people than we might care to believe, and a message that hasn't lost its impact in 2000 years!<br />Joy's writing style is unique in that she manages to describe the mood of the environment (at any given setting) without going into overkill (e.g. telling the reader so much about a room that they forget which character just walked into it) and can tell the same story from two different perspectives without confusing the reader.<br />There are a few slow parts in Rain Dance, but all-and-all I enjoyed a glimpse inside the lives of two women who start off completely opposites, but soon learn to understand each other; growing to actually become good friends.  An interesting mix these two characters, Jonica and Stacie; sometimes people don't know what they're looking for until it's almost too late.  The two women play an important, intertwined role in discovering what life can offer, if you're willing to sacrifice your own selfishness for a greater love.<br />This is a novel about putting your faith in a higher power, for the human soul, alone, can only get you through so much.	2003-11-29

But all and all this novel reads like a fifth-grader wrote it, and contains an extremely graphic rape scene between a man and a little girl.  This novel, just like The Catcher In The Rye, is nothing but an attempt to write a story for people who love to see negativity and pessimism glorified.  A play for that \\"woe-is-me\\" crowd of \\"LEFTIST\\" morons.  An easy target to shoot for.  If you want to become a famous novelist, just use the Lord's name in vain, over and over again, or describe how you hate the world because it has let you down.<br />Like I said, there are a few parts of this novel I think are great.
