We love them. This one, for some reason, has failed to grab their attention. I barely made it half way through before the kids started to suggest that I read other books.<br />This book starts with the jealousy and conflicts among the Greek gods (which, the story goes, led to the Trojan war). About a third of the way through, one finally gets to the war outside Troy. In contrast, the real dramatic part of the Trojan war--the horse (named in the title) comes across as a rather minor point in the story. Which is a shame given that the Trojan horse most likely is more intriguing to young readers than the jealousy and power struggle among some Greek gods that the kids have not quite got a grip on.<br />Aside from lacking focus in this short book (and packing in way too much loose details on Greek gods), the book sounds rather dry. Perhaps all Level 4 books are like this one, but we are a bit disappointed.	2003-11-09

Frankly, when I finished reading this one, I thought to myself that this book was a bit dense--probably best suited for 10 and up and only those scientifically inclined. The information is accurate, but the language is a bit \\"stiff\\" (dry like a science journal) and there is a lot of repetition (perhaps as a way of drilling the concepts into children). We also bought a couple of other books by the same author and all of these books have overlapping sections. After a couple of books, I got tired of the constant repetition.<br />Had I logged on and put in a review then, I might have given the book 3 stars. But, when I put my kids to bed, my 5 year old said to me, with a naughty smile on his face, \\"It is not fair--girls get two X's and boys only get one X.\\" So I said to him that he's got something girls don't have-what is that? He replied, \\"The Y!\\"<br />I have to admit I was impressed--with my son as well as with the book. Dry the book may sound to me, somehow it manages to impart some very important information and makes the information interesting and accessible to a 5 year old. For that, I think my money is well spent.	2003-11-04
US	52868522	R11J48NBHFA754	1894601009	571935526	You're Full of Genes	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	My kids love this book!	I bought this book along with several others related to the topic (The Gene Machine, DNA Is Here to Stay, among others), when I discovered that it was hard to offer a clear, simple yet accurate explanation of what genes were to my 7 and 5 year olds. For sure I explained some basic concepts, but I could tell that my kids thought it was boring grown-up stuff.<br />This book makes this boring, dense subject into a fun children's book, complete with some simple hands-on activities. There are pictures of a gene (named G-Tag) and an enzyme (who cooks the genes so that they stay together). There are pages where kids can put up pictures of their parents, grandparents and themselves so that they can compare the physical similarities that get passed on from generation to generation. This book suits best kids who are 5 and up. Depending on prior exposure to the subject, I believe even some 10 year olds could get something out of this book: it is clear, simple, visually concrete, and humorous. It does not go beyond the basic concepts of genes, enzymes, and cells, but it does a great job putting these basic concepts into concrete forms for kids to grasp. My second grader read the book twice because she thought it was so interesting. We also read the other books I bought. My kids liked the others (which are a bit more dense and covers slightly different areas), but none delighted them like You're Full of Genes.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2003-11-04

The dishes are simply delicious. I cooked the Beef Bourguinon for my family and our visiting friends and it was a big hit. A little bit leftover got consumed over buns the next day!<br />But, I have to admit to two personal biases: I love food with lots of flavors, and I always brown the meat before putting it into soups or stews--and this book suits me in both fronts. (I believe the author does state that one does not need to brown the meat, but that the meat tastes better if it is browned.) With the slow cooker relieving me from keeping constant watch over the food, I find the recipes in the book easy and the payback (of a great meal) more than worth the effort.<br />I highly recommend this book.	2003-08-19

I borrowed this book from the library. The book further peaked the kids' interest in the plants (they check the plants every day). We got a lot out of this book. In fact, we read it over and over and over again for so many time that I bought a copy.<br />The book has pictures and very simple of clear texts that explain several unusual plants: the carniverous plants, poison ivy and some other poisonous plants. I think this is a great book for kids.	2003-08-08

To my surprise, this little book offers other very important and interesting details on plants that are not in the other book (which is an excellent book also).<br />I am glad we got this book (e.g.it explained why we shouldn't keep touching the Venus Flytrap--it probably saved the plant's life from inquisitive little hands).	2003-08-08

I bought this book in preparation for the long summer months and my two rather demanding kids. My son (age 5) loves to do math and my daughter (7) is excellent with math problems though I wanted to show her how to do things &quot;better&quot;. I, as an adult who has been fairly efficient with math problems, have always had various &quot;quirky&quot; tricks that help me arrive at a math solution fast. But I found it hard to explain to my children in a systematic way why my method works. This book does the job for me. It is not a theory book; it is not exactly a workbook, though it has exercises that one can follow. It guides the reader (preferrably an adult) systematically through the process of breaking down numbers in order to solve addition, substraction, multiplification and other problems fast. Each page progressively builds upon the previous pages.<br />I have to admit that it helps that I have had experiences teaching and therefore I appreciate good teaching materials. I guess it also helps that I have always used certain tricks that this book discusses. But I really believe most people can benefit from this book. Each elementary school math teacher ought to get a copy of this book. Parents who wish to speed their children along with math can certainly learn a thing or two from this book as well.	2003-06-11

So let me say up front that I find these books informative both in textual content and in illustrations/photos. However, beware, once one gets hooked on one of these books, one is almost compelled to buy more and more of them--and that is not all out of love for these books. For example, I bought the All About Trees book. Upon close reading, I find several common trees missing from the book. Then I realized that there is a &quot;All About Flowering Trees&quot; book. I have the &quot;All About Shrubs&quot; book. But there is also the &quot;All About Hedges&quot; book. Should I get that one as well if I am thinking of planting a shrub as a hedge? See what I mean?<br />There is another problem. I live in the east coast of the US. Some of the plants, such as the beautiful rose &quot;Ingrid Bergman&quot;, are simply very hard to get--last I checked, only the nurseries in the UK carry this particular cultivar. I guess this series intends to reach a broader range of readership, but I find it a bit disappointing to say the least.<br />Having said the above, I admit I am new to gardening, which is why I am buying all these books. So maybe in the next five years, I will be able to take better advantage of the info. offered in these series.	2003-05-01

One also gets some fairly interesting detective/mystery intertwined with romance. The reader follows the likable heroine, a young independent minded Irish woman, on her adventures and cannot help but root for her to find safety, securing and warmth in this strange city.<br />I hesitate to call this book a historical novel, even though the story develops against a historical background. Something about the dialogues, the innocent (but educated) heroine's observations seem to lack authenticity. Instead of hearing the heroine's voice set in the 1900s, I seem to hear the author's voice and see through the author's much better-informed-view.<br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading it.	2003-01-05

The same women try over and over and over again with the same ploy to get the Constable's attention. The same complaint about his landlady who tries to feed him good food. The same annoyance at a minister's wife who insists on finding out who's trespassed her garden.<br />The story is set in Wales, and there are bits and pieces of the Welsh diction inter-dispersed in the dialogues. But the entire time I was reading, I found myself wanting to be convinced that the author indeed knew enough about life in a Welsh village to set a story in it. In the end, I am not convinced at all.	2003-01-05

The plots are predictable--which is perhaps one of the reasons why people like to read these novels. Spenser is witty, likable, and honorable. After all these years and after all the Spenser novels, I never seem to get tired of Spenser. The ending--catching/killing the bad guys, like the predictable plots--usually gives me a great sense of satisfaction.<br />But Hugger Mugger is a bit of a disappointment. The story is interesting, the suspense is there though to a lesser degree than some of his other novels, but the ending leaves much to be desired--there does not seem to be a resolution. One of the perpetrators walks out a free woman (though the police chief hints at carrying out justice at some later point), and the other--I am not sure what the story is--it is implied he is guilty but it is not clear as to exactly which part of the crimes he had actually committed. So for all the anticipation for the past couple of nights, I feel being left out cold. That's life, perhaps, but that's not why I pick up a Spenser novel to read.	2002-12-17

(Books 1-4)	Books	5	40	50	N	N	A delightful series	I bought a bunch of books for my daughter (age 6) to read, and she likes the Junie B. Jones series best. She laughs out loud as she reads and is totally engrossed in the story.<br />The events in the Junie B. Jones series are typical things that young children either directly encounter in their daily lives or fantasize encountering (such as being left behind by a school bus). Some of them may seem mundane to grown-ups, but full of excitement,  suspense and breathless anticipation for young readers. Junie B. Jones is a spirited girl with a unique, creative, and humorous view of the world around her. She may first come across as opinionated (as most 5, 6 year olds are), but one quickly discovers the \\"loopholes\\" in her opinions. My daughter frequently points out, with a laugh, what Junie B. Jones says wrong or how she mis-interpretes a situation.<br />The stories end well and in a joyful and high spirited note.<br />I highly recommend this series!	2002-10-21

The stories are short--about 2 to 3 pages each. They are well written for reading out loud, very funny and full of surprises and suspense. Each tale ends (like The Arabian Nights stories) at a suspenseful point and promises the children that if they behave they'll get to hear how the event will unfold. Since they are short, one can read two or three stories each night, and this book can last a week. My 6 year old daughter picked up the book (after I've finished reading it) and started to read it herself. My four year old loves it. And the stories carry some important themes--such as be careful what you tell a stranger (in this case a hungry cat) yet they were not overly preachy, nor do the themes intrudes upon the drama of each story.<br />This book is a great value all around. Worth more than [price] for sure!	2002-10-15

It outlines the history of the breed in question, the temperament (in several paragraphs, NOT with little obscure and ambiguous icons), and there is an overall rating area that succinctly profiles the breed's exercise needs, energy level, affection level for other pets and dogs and strangers, and grooming needs. If one is trying to decide between two breeds, the ratings make it very convenient to compare and contrast. It also provides the AKC rank for each breed, which gives one an idea of the popularity (and perhaps the availability) of the particular breed in the US. This book does not list very obscure European breeds, however. For those of you who are \\"just looking for a nice dog\\", I do highly recommend this book.	2002-09-28

However, the texts are brief and not very informative. The symbols (which indicate a breed's temperament, grooming needs) are ambiguous at best. e.g. When there is no symbol indicating whether a dog needs room to run, does it mean the dog has no such need? Basically, one can get an idea of the size, look, origin, and original purpose of a breed from this book. For any information beyond a one-sentence summary, one must find another source.	2002-08-18

No nonsense, straight talking, smart and useful as a conceptual and practical guidance book. It dymystifies interior decoration, makes it possible for ordinary people who, like me, do not live in million dollar mansions, to relate to her decorating ideas. This is a great book for those new to interior decorating and those who want to pick up a few usable rules of interior decoration without feeling restrained by those very same rules.<br />The texts are incredibly easy and fun to read; very few waster words. Plenty of photos to illustrate the point and the photos and the text go hand in hand--this is not a show and tell of the rich and famous.<br />The text is printed in an unusual way: the types are big (which is great) and black, regular sized print are mixed in with colored, bigger sized print. I like it that way but it drove my husband nuts. There is only one paragraph in the book (one on the pros and cons of painting open floor plan houses in different colors) which I found confusing and not well written. Everything else is right on the money. I highly recommend the book.	2002-03-11

This book has some really interesting (and complex) examples of various rooms decorated with stencils. It also comes with some of the stencil patterns at the end of the book. But as a beginner, I find some basic information missing (and had to get another book as a result). This book assumes that one understands the basics of painting and stencilling.It does not explain, for example, what kind of paint does one use on walls vs on furniture.  Despite the beautiful pillow on the cover, the book does NOT cover stencilling on fabric at all. And if one does not want to take on an elaborate project to cover all the walls of a room, there is no example on simple projects (such as adding just a border). If you are artistic, experienced with painting and stencilling and can visualize the results, this book is good.	2002-02-15

She wants to read it every night. Sometimes she picks to read the purple lines (lines are color-coded so parents and kids can take regular turns). Then she switches to the red lines for a second read. The repetition at the end of each rhyme, which I disliked, gives her much delight because she can read those lines without hesitation. So this is a great book for kindergarteners who are just beginning to learn to read. I can imagine six months down the road my daughter would much prefer something more sophisticated.

I consider this one a particularly good collection for those looking for basic children's and adult pattterns, such as socks, mitterns, (fabulous) hats, neck warmers, vests (v-neck or zippered), or plain crew neck sweaters. Plus, most (maybe all) of the patterns can be done in worsted weight yarn. Unlike Minnies, which uses many expensive designer yarn (to be dry-clean no less) for baby outfits, Big Fish Little Fish patterns can be done with any worsted yarn. So while I enjoyed making outfits from Jil Eaton's previous Minnowknits books, I like Big Fish Little Fish for its &quot;wholesomeness&quot;. After you buy this book, you no longer need to buy individual patterns for socks, mitterns, basic sweaters and vests. I highly recommend this book.	2001-12-24

I disagree with some of the reviewers  here on Amazon.com in that I do NOT think one should judge Edith Hahn (the  author)'s personal choices during that difficult period. What's important,  really, is that, having survived the Holocaust through her sheer wits,  Edith Hahn bore witness not only to the horrors of the Holocaust, but to  the actions, reactions, morality and the lack thereof, of ordinary Germans.

This book takes the concept of slip stitch knitting and goes beyond it a little bit--hence lies the problem. It attempts to equate slip stitching knitting with traditional color knitting (or fair isle knitting), but fails  to convince me why one should try its method over all the others. Moreover,  this book does not show the intricate beauty of a mosaic pattern, such as  those presented by Barbara Walker.<br />  I knitted a couple of cute looking  hats following the slip stitch patterns in this book. Then I knitted them  again, using the traditional method but following the picture chart in the  book. Slip stitch knitting of mosaic patterns, as presented in this book,  offered little advantage. For those interested in slip stitch knitting, I  suggest Barbara Walker's book on Mosaic knitting.	1999-11-10
