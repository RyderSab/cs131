Having lived most of my life near the New Jersey shore, and about only five miles from the site of some of these incidents, this book was a \\"must read\\" for me. And I would have to say Michael Capuzzo doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Perhaps because I am familiar with many of the places mentioned, I have an unfair advantage over most readers - this made it easier to follow and understand the story (my hometown of Belford was even mentioned once!). But even without that perspective I feel that I would have enjoyed it anyway. Capuzzo does indeed write the story something like a novel - delving into what people may have been thinking and feeling - even what the shark may have been doing in-between attacks. Because of this, it can't be looked at as a completely factual book. But that's missing the point. The story itself is true (although there remains some debate about a \\"lone killer\\" or many), and that's what makes it so compelling.<br /><br />There was a shark and there were several attacks, and some came in an inland creek. Debating whether it was a Great White or a Bull shark in the creek is immaterial to the story of the \\"terror\\" that had gripped New Jersey; that was certainly all too real, for the unfortunate victims and for their families.<br /><br />Capuzzo should also be commended for the research that was necessary to write this book. I say that because, even though I've lived here for 32 years, this story was unknown to me until this book (and \\"12 Days of Terror\\") came out in 2001. It simply was not well-known lore of the area, believe it or not.<br /><br />I'm convinced Capuzzo has changed that - at least for those of us who live here, he has. I drive over the Matawan Creek on my way to work in the morning - and there isn't a day that goes by where I'm not peeking out my car window, just to get a glimpse of what might be lurking in the water below!<br /><br />Well done by Capuzzo. Four stars.	2005-08-25

This is partly because Franklin never intended his book for publication.<br /><br />He was writing it for the benefit of his son - partly as a guide for life, and partly as a family history.  Indeed, on the first page, Franklin writes that he has always enjoyed hearing stories about his ancestors, and hopes his son will be as interested to learn of his father's life.  However, after Franklin's break with his son, he continues to write, but now it is for the benefit of all of his ancestors.  Franklin's disagreement with his son William is just one of many details that are missing from this book.<br /><br />I was always interested in Franklin and it had long been a goal of mine to read his autobiography.  Had I known that the years 1758-1790 were not covered, which were probably the most important and influential of his life, I might not have read it.  And that would have been a mistake.<br /><br />For although the major events of the 1770s and 1780s are missing, like the American Revolution, the Treaty of Paris, and the Constitutional Convention, there is so much material about the early years of Franklin's life here that it is still a worthwhile book.  Who knew Franklin was practically a champion swimmer, for example?  We often think of Franklin as the elder statesman of the Founding Fathers, as indeed he was.  Franklin was born 26 years before George Washington.  But in this book we see Franklin as a boy and then a young man, whole periods of his life that are forgotten when one thinks of his later, great contributions.<br /><br />Thankfully, Franklin documents much of it, and it makes for terrific reading.  His battles with his brother, his early struggles with established religion, his bold jump to Philadelphia, and then to London, when he was still so young.  He even mentions that he was a regular patron of the local prostitutes in Philadelphia!  This is not something you'd see in Poor Richard's Almanac, of that I am sure.<br /><br />Even though the book is lacking the major events of Franklin's later life, it is still rich in anecdotes and instruction.  There is much to be learned from Ben, whether he was founding the first fire department or library, or making monetary contributions to every religious denomination in Philadelphia, or his attempts at achieving \\"moral perfection\\" - actions that demonstrated his industriousness, his tolerance, his wisdom.<br /><br />Franklin was an incredibly fascinating character and he remains one of the giants of American history.  You wouldn't know it from reading this autobiography, but it doesn't matter; the historians have safely documented his legacy in other books.  In these pages, in his own words, you learn what made Franklin tick, what he believed in, and why.  And that's more than enough.<br /><br />Five stars.Poor Richard's Almanac, of that I am sure. <br /> <br />Even though the book is lacking the major events of Franklin's later life, it is still rich in anecdotes and instruction.

Books	3	0	0	N	N	Outdated but Interesting	This book was published in 1973, and it was written as a \\"current events\\" book, so it has little relevance for today's reader.  At least, as far as current events go.  The players, coaches, front office people and the owner are all long gone, either retired or deceased.<br /><br />However, it is still worth reading as a history book.  You can learn a lot about the workings of the Red Sox, and read some of the stories that today's Sox fan may not have heard before. Most fans know that Boston may have had first crack at Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays, and those tales are relayed again here. But others, like the racism of the scouting department, or the way in which prospects advanced through the system, were new to me.<br /><br />I would say this book would interest only the diehard Red Sox fan, or a serious fan of baseball history in general.  Others are likely to lose interest fairly quickly.	2005-08-24

Maybe the best compliment I can pay is that I just finished reading it, again, and I still loved it.  This is probably the 4th or 5th time I've done so since I first read it in college.  What makes it so great?<br /><br />Voltaire (or his real name, Arouet) takes many of the institutions of man and ridicules them to a hilarious degree.  I began laughing with the very first paragraph and never stopped.  Nothing is sacred here - governments, religions, traditions, science - all feel the sting of Voltaire's commentary.  And Voltaire plays no favorites.  At different times he had something to say about the French, Spanish, Portuguese, English, Germans, Turks, etc.  With religion, Voltaire spread the wealth as well.  Catholics, Protestants, Jews and even Muslims are not spared.  Voltaire went to great lengths to ensure that almost no one escaped his wrath.<br /><br />The author's basic premise was to state that the world is a terrible place.  But the title character, Candide, is an eternal optimist, and he tries to reconcile the evil he sees in the world with what he believes, which is that all that happens \\"is for the best.\\"  As things get worse, he continues to try to find the \\"silver lining\\" in the tragedies he witnesses or experiences.<br /><br />Voltaire's work is a masterpiece and has stood the test of time.  It can be read and understood almost as well today as it was when it was produced over 250 years ago.  I just can't recommend it enough - \\"Candide\\" is the ultimate cynic's handbook!<br /><br />Five stars.	2004-12-08

What I got was something quite different.<br /><br />The narrarator, Robert Peck, is a 12-year boy old in Vermont, living a Shaker life and helping his father on the family farm.  The story does follow his passage from boyhood to manhood, but the way it does so is what I found troubling.<br /><br />For one, there is a serious disrespect for animals and nature in the story.  The narrarator talks about catching bullfrogs to eat their legs, shoots squirrels so his mother can use the squirrel's digested food (nuts) to sprinkle on their cake, helps his neighbor to subject a dog to a \\"death match\\" with a weasel, and worst of all, assists his father in killing his own pet so the family can eat it!  I know of no child that would kill or eat his pet, and I know of no father that would actually think of such a thing.  Just ridiculous.<br /><br />On top of this, there were sexual innuendos and references made in the story, which I can't see having any place in a book for young adults.  The suggestion that a widowed neighbor who had been mean to people \\"is some improved\\" now that a handyman was around is patently offensive.<br /><br />I don't know how much of the story is autobiographical, as the book is defined as a novel.  But the author uses his own name for the boy in the story, and his father's name and profession for the father in the story.  And the story is set in Vermont, where the author grew up.  I sincerely hope much of this book was fictitious; if not, Robert Peck had an absoultely horrible childhood, and certainly not one to be remembered fondly.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  I gave it 1 star because I had to give it at least 1.	2004-12-01

Hamilton was decent, but I felt it was lacking in detail; in fact, excluding the maps, chronology, etc., the narrative is only about 150 pages.  For a figure of Alexander's stature, that's just not enough.<br /><br />I can also say that Hamilton wrote this book for those already somewhat familiar with Alexander and his contemporaries.  I knew of his parents, Philip and Olympias, but many other names, like Hephaestion, Callisthenes and Cleitus (to name a few) were new to me.  And unfortunately, Hamilton sometimes mentions them  quite briefly, as if assuming the reader already knows who these people were, and the state of their relations with Alexander. Other times, he refers to important events as if the reader knows the story; I often did not, as this was the first book about Alexander I have read. Again, this made for some difficult reading until I got an understanding of the main people and events of Alexander's life.<br /><br />Still, the book does appear to cover all of the important milestones and events, albeit sometimes briefly (for example, only one paragraph is devoted to the story of the Gordian Knot).  But Hamilton does a good job of discussing some of the more controversial deeds of Alexander, like the burning of Persepolis and the murder of Cleitus.  And he also provides the opinions of many other historians, both ancient and modern, helping the reader to decide for himself about Alexander's acts.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fine work by Hamilton.  However, if you are new to Alexander, I would suggest another book first, perhaps Arrian's Anabasis of Alexander.  Once you have a general understanding of who Alexander was, this book will help you to gain an even deeper insight.<br /><br />Three stars.	2004-11-30

Though it is likely that not all of those mentioned did so (there are 17 chapters in the book), it is also likely that at least a few are accurate.<br /><br />Huyghe provides as much evidence as he can muster for each possibility.  And some of it seems to make sense.  Pottery connections between different parts of the world, similar cultural practices, similar words for the same object, transplanted flora, etc.  I am convinced that a few of the assertions are on the mark.  But there are also a few chapters where the evidence seems sketchy at best.<br /><br />Even so, it was interesting to read about them, whether you're persuaded or not.  It stands to reason that there had to be at least a few contacts with either Asia, Europe or Africa before 1492 or even 1000 (Vikings).

The primary audience is for older boys or young men. The hero, Harry, is a 15-year old living in Vernon, NY. Harry is left to provide for his family after his father is killed in a tragic accident, and encounters many trials along the way. But he also wins some people over with his attitude and resolve, and in the end comes out much better for his efforts.<br /><br /> Horatio Alger Jr., the author, wrote many stories of this type for young boys in the 19th century (the copyright on the book I have is 1870). It seems he followed much the same formula with all the stories, namely, a young, honest man as the hero; a villain or two out to get the better of the hero; usually an older person or two who comes to the young man's aid; and a few sometimes unbelievable events that result in the hero coming out on top. In this particular story Harry Raymond not only strikes gold in Australia, but he befriends a man with no heirs who agrees to leave his own fortune to Harry should something happen to him. Of course, this good soul dies, leaving Harry a rich young man. Apparently the famed Hollywood Ending existed before Hollywood did!<br /><br /> I gave this two stars. It's not terrible, buy way too formulaic and predictable to be enjoyed very much.	2004-07-26

Beginning with Bach in the 17th century and ending at the dawn of the 20th with Verdi, Strauss and Tchaikovsky, the tapes cover over two hundred years and arguably the greatest composers who ever lived.<br /><br /> The stories are a combination of narraration, actors reading quotes from the composers, and excerpts from some of their most famous compositions. You will hear Handel's &quot;Messiah,&quot; Mozart's &quot;Marriage of Figaro,&quot; Beethoven's 5th and 9th Symphonies, Tchaikovsky's &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and much more. In addition, you will also learn the stories behind the works, often revealing details not commonly known.<br /><br /> Overall, this was a very good program. There was a slight echo when some actors were quoting the composers, but this does not detract much from the overall excellence of the production.<br /><br /> Four stars. Good stuff!	2004-07-21

Going back to the ground-breaking work of baseball writer Bill James,  and continuing with Beane's predecessor Sandy Alderson, Beane implemented ideas that were in circulation but were never really tried before.  The result was a winning percentage that was the envy of just about every team in baseball.<br />But Beane is not always correct in his thinking, and his attitude left a lot to be desired.  Despite his obsession with certain numbers, like OBP, and his belief that they will translate into wins, pitching has remained the ultimate determinant factor in a baseball team's success.  The A's have ranked 1st, 2nd or 3rd in ERA every year since 1999, while finishing as low as 10th in OBP.  Beane - and author Michael Lewis -  conveniently ignore this fact when explaining the reasons for the A's success.<br />Beane's disdain for the stolen base is also troubling, as it is well known that speed can disrupt a pitcher's rhythm and be a major factor in a closely-played game.  The players at the top of the runs scored category are, more often than not, effective base stealers as well.  Beane ignores this too.<br />Lastly, throughout the book Beane complains about his shortstop, Miguel Tejada, because Beane dislikes the fact that Tejada doesn't take enough pitches.  He's not patient at the plate.  What the book fails to mention is that Tejada finishes 7th in HR and 3rd in RBI and wins the MVP award in 2002!  How foolish does this make Beane look?  Very, if you ask me.<br />Still, this was a well written effort, and it was very interesting to follow the behind-the-scenes storyline of a baseball team for an entire season.  However, before deifying Beane for his efforts, it would behoove the A's to win a playoff series during his regime.  As of this writing, they remain winless, having lost to the Red Sox in 2003.  Contrary to what Beane would have you believe, &quot;just getting there&quot; isn't good enough!<br />Four stars.till, this was a well written effort, and it was very interesting to follow the behind-the-scenes storyline of a baseball team for an entire season.

Set against the backdrop of Depression 1930s America, a team of misfits (owner, trainer, jockeys and horse) come together to forge a winning team that few could have foreseen.<br />Each had his own obstacles -  the jockey's blind eye, the trainer's unorthodox methods, the owner's western roots - and that's not even mentioning the horse.  Seabiscuit had even bigger problems.  He didn't look like a champion, for starters.  And he was raced far too much as a 2-year old, which stunted his progress and made him appear to be a joke to much of the racing establishment.<br />But once these men began to work with Seabiscuit, it was not long before his true promise came to be realized.  Seabiscuit won numerous races, set many track records, and retired as the leading money winner of his time.  Not bad for an &quot;also-ran!&quot;<br />Hillenbrand tells Seabiscuit's story while also managing to give many details about &quot;big picture&quot; stories as well - e.g., life in 1930s America, the trials and tribulations of jockeys, the up-and-down popularity of the sport of horse racing. Telling all of these while keeping the reader not only interested but riveted, Hillenbrand has written an exceptional book.<br />I did not know the story of Seabiscuit before this book came along; now, I will never forget it!

I've come to think that reading this book is a &quot;necessary evil&quot; - you don't really want to read it, but you have to.  The revelations Eric Schlosser provides are too important to ignore.<br />It starts slowly with the dawn of the fast food era, but soon enough Schlosser is touching on many topics; globalization, the exploitation of fast food workers, how and why fast food companies focus their ad campaigns towards children, why the fast food companies don't like labor unions, and more.<br />Then it really gets interesting when Schlosser begins to talk about the food itself.  The chemicals used, the procedures of the meat-packing plants, pathogens, mad cow disease, E coli, salmonella...it's all here.  It's not a pleasant story, but as mentioned, a story that needs to be told nonetheless.<br />Powerful and disturbing stuff.  Would have been five stars if not for the slow start.	2004-05-17

The highlight of this part of the book has to be his interaction with childhood friend Steven Katz, his hiking companion.  Katz brought a hilarious &quot;funny man&quot; personality to Bryson's &quot;straight man.&quot;  From the moment he steps off the plane to the end of the book, Katz brings much comic relief.<br />And that was needed, because the second &quot;book&quot; Bryson provides is a history of the AT itself, along with stories about different points along the AT.  While informative, these sections of the book definitely lack the same appeal as those that include hiking companion Katz.  Indeed, for a section of the book Bryson and Katz go their separate ways, and it seemed the story lost a bit of steam.  It was a welcome relief when Katz reappeared further on...<br />As is typical with Bryson, he manages to intersperse periods of sobering thought along with the large doses of humor.  Including are scathing criticisms of the National Park Service, for its numerous instances of environmental mismanagement, and of the behavior and mindset of our own citizens in decades past (e.g., the state of West Virginia used to offer a college scholarship to whomever killed the most wildlife in a season).  Brilliant ideas like that led to the extinction of several species, like the mountain lion and the Carolina Parakeet.<br />But Bryson manages to tie this all together into one entertaining read, and one you are sure to enjoy.  After finishing it, I was inspired to go a little hiking myself.  The only problem was, I was afraid I might run into Mary Ellen!  (After you read the book, you'll know what I mean...)<br />Definitely good stuff from Bryson.  Four stars.ll know what I mean...)<br />Definitely good stuff from Bryson.  Four stars.	2003-08-21

In it, Crane relates what it is like to be young and brash, thinking in ideal terms that come crashing down with a harsh dose of reality.  The reader goes along for the ride as Henry enlists for the Union Army during the American Civil War.  Henry imagines for himself visions of grandeur, winning glory in battle and the respect and admiration of his peers.  However, as his first battle approaches, Henry begins to feel differently...<br />He questions some fellow soldiers about the upcoming battle and how they'll perform.  As these doubts continue to fester in his mind, Henry more and more grows apprehensive about what is to come.  In short order Henry's original dreams of glory are a forgotten memory as he cowers from the battlefield...<br />From here Crane relates how Henry goes from battlefield deserter to genuine hero.  But it is the way in which Crane tells it that is worthy of our attention.  Having never been in battle himself, people were (and still are) amazed at how vividly Crane was able to \\"bring the war home\\" to the reader.  His various accounts of combat, and of the state of mind of the participants, have long been acknowledged as masterful.  Indeed, one finds it hard to believe Mr. Crane was not there himself.<br />Crane wrote this story when he was just 25 but died within a few years of consumption.  We can only wonder what else we could have expected to receieve from his gifted pen; however, at the same time, we should be grateful that he left us \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\" before he met his untimely end.  For in it Crane captured the real essence of war, and the effect that it has on ordinary people.  Crane didn't coin the phrase, but \\"Badge\\" reinforces it all the same...war is hell.<br />Five stars.	2003-04-19

I first read it at 12 years of age but couldn't appreciate the author's entire message, not having the requisite knowledge of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath.  Reading it again, however, I came to understand and fully appreciate the genius of George Orwell.<br />Animal Farm is a scathing criticism of Communism, or more specifically, the Communist system of the former USSR.  Himself a Socialist, Orwell detested the way in which its ideals were twisted and manipulated by those in power in the USSR, resulting in a terrible fate for the common people.<br />The story pulls no punches; although Orwell uses the fictional setting of a farm with talking animals, his aim is to expose the reader to the hypocrisy of the Soviet regime.  The figure of Josef Stalin is easily identified in the character Napoleon, one of the leaders of the animal rebellion.  The leaders were first inspired by Major, an aging boar on the farm who clearly represents Karl Marx.  Major had given the farm animals the idea that they should strive for a better life than their current plight .  After his death, Napoleon and Snowball, another character representing Vladimir Lenin, lead the overthrow of the human-run farm and establish \\"Animal Farm.\\"  But Napoleon later assumes complete control over the Rebellion, and, as Stalin did, betrays virtually all aims and maxims originally put forth by the rebellion founders.  The story ends with the common farm animals in a far worse state of affairs than when the story began.<br />Orwell used his \\"fairy story,\\" published in 1945, to remind people of the dangers of Soviet Russia, and to differentiate it from the idea of Socialism.  It is also a condemnation of totalitarianism in general (one can clearly see Joseph Goebbels in the character of Squealer, the mouthpiece of the rebellion).<br />These messages are just as powerful today as they were when Orwell first wrote them over half a century ago.<br />To paraphrase the chilling Commandment from the last chapter:  \\"All authors are equal, but some authors are more equal than others.\\"<br />Read, and understand.

As I suspected/remembered, the film departs greatly from the book (and not for the better).  For those who have only seen the film, take the time to read the original story.  You'll be glad you did.<br />That story is about the Time Traveller and his journey into the very distant future - to the year 802,701 AD.  The Traveller chooses to go out of pure curiosity, hoping to see what the future had in store.  What he found seemed like something out of the past.<br />The semi-humans he encountered lived in an era not unlike the Bronze Age, with limited communication skills and little else.  These Eloi seemed content to while away their time, without a care in the world - except when it was dark.  For at that time the other semi-human species, the Morlocks, emerged from below...with a taste for Eloi.<br />The Time Traveller struggles to understand how mankind could have degenerated into such a state of affairs.  His distaste for the Morlocks and their actions (including the theft of his time machine) soon causes the Traveller to confront them, with disastrous consequences for both.<br />Generally accepted as one of the first Science Fiction stories, it is believed Wells was also using the story to advance his criticism of the capitalist system.  Specifically, the story relates what happens when one group of people is continually subjugated by another higher, elite class.  Wells' tale of the fractured relationship between the Eloi and the Morlocks is his warning of the dangers of allowing such a system to continue unabated.<br />All politics aside, the story remains excellent.  Although written more than a century ago, it has lost none of its power or appeal.  It is also a short read, at less than 150 pages, and is also very &quot;readable&quot; - despite its age the story does not seem at all antiquated.  That Wells was able to accomplish this in the 1890s is no small feat, and is an indication of his prowess as an writer.<br />Five stars.to accomplish this in the 1890s is no small feat, and is an indication of his prowess as an writer.  <br />Five stars.	2003-02-23

Their collective ability to overcome the difficulties presented by the Second World War and the subsequent challenges they faced after the war left an indelible impression on Brokaw.  And it will do the same to you.<br />The stories of all kinds of Americans are here: both overseas and on the home front, men and women, white and black (and Japanese) - showing the effort put forth by this generation was truly a &quot;group effort,&quot; and establishing them as a generation worthy of taking its place among the others in American history.<br />As opposed to other reviewers, I don't get the impression that Brokaw was trying to discredit those that came either before or after this particular time in history.  Rather, Brokaw makes the case that, because of the battle with Fascism the &quot;free world&quot; was facing at the time, the hardships endured and sacrifices made by these people held greater significance than perhaps ever before (or since).  For if these people failed, and Fascism prevailed, what would be the state of the world today?<br />It is not just the later US generations that should be thankful to them, but rather all peoples around the world who owe a debt of gratitude to these remarkable men and women.  The tremendous fortitude that enabled them (along with all those around the globe engaged in the struggle) to withstand the destructive dictatorships bent on world domination is legendary and not to be forgotten.<br />Ever.	2003-02-22

As they are taken from weekly columns he wrote for a paper in England, this is not a &quot;book&quot; per se.  But that fact doesn't take away from its charm, or, at times, stinging criticism.<br />This is mostly a humorous work, like the article Bryson wrote poking fun at the US Federal Tax Return (wait 'til you hear it!).  But it's not all light-hearted; Bryson also finds time for more serious matters, like immigration and gun control.  His analyses of these situations and his expose' of inconsistent American values/beliefs is worth the price of the book alone.  Sometimes it takes an outsider, like Bryson was, to show you things you couldn't see yourself.  He does this splendidly.<br />Others have commented that the book was a little too formulaic; I have noticed this too.  Many of the articles end with a &quot;punch-line&quot; of sarcasm, and it seemed a bit predictable the more I read.  For this reason I would recommend not reading too much at once.  It worked better for me listening to one or two themes at a time, and then taking a break.  The material (and Bryson's approach) remained more fresh that way.<br />In all, though, this was a good effort.  Bryson definitely makes you think about issues you might have taken for granted.  Four stars.	2002-11-16
US	43148234	R341DJLX5N2YO0	0375409521	622445077	Life Stories: Profiles from The New Yorker	Books	5	4	4	N	N	"Life Stories" Hit the Mark	This is a compilation of some of the best Profiles to appear in the New Yorker over the last 80 years. Sometimes you will be familiar with the person being profiled, sometimes not, but in all cases you will find the stories entertaining and the writing, superb.<br />My favorite Profile happens to be of one of the non-famous persons, George H. Hunter (\\"Mr. Hunter's Grave,\\" by Joseph Mitchell). It is a story not so much about a person but of a long-forgotten community, and a way of life. Despite being the longest entry in the audio collection, I rewound the tape three or four times to listen to it again and again - it was that good.<br />Some of the celebrity stories are just as compelling, although, being celebrities, many aspects of their lives are already well known. But this sometimes opened a window into foreshadowing that could not have been appreciated by the reader (or even the writer) at the time the piece was done. One example of this concerns Ernest Hemingway (\\"How Do You Like It Now, Gentlemen?\\", by Lillian Ross). Hidden somewhere in the middle of the Profile, Ross mentions the fact that Hemingway's father had committed suicide. This had no major relation to the story in general, and was probably forgotten by most readers at the time, but we have the perspective of history. And it becomes more than just a tidbit when we realize that Hemingway, too, committed suicide 10 years later, in 1961.<br />Another eyebrow-raising instance came when hearing about Marlon Brando (\\"The Duke In His Domain,\\" by Truman Capote). Capote was on location with Brando in Japan as Brando was taking part in the filming of \\"Sayonara.\\" Brando at one point confesses to Capote that he had to lose weight for the part, and that he wasn't there yet. He still had 10-15 pounds to go. Despite this, the dinners delivered to Brando's hotel room are not those of one looking to cut down; to the contrary, Brando could only gain weight eating the food being sent up to him! Hearing Brando fuss about what he should and should not eat and Capote take note of the rich foods on the tray, it almost seems fake, as if Capote knew how Brando was going to end up. But, of course, he didn't. The story was written in 1957!<br />But what makes this collection great, though, is the quality of the writing itself. It matters not the subject: actor, comedian, dancer, writer, boxer, even a dog! The common thread running through all the Profiles is the way in which each story is told. Always lucid, always interesting, the stories are less stories and more like works of art.<br />If you enjoy exceptional writing, this collection is for you. Highly recommended. Five stars.ut what he should and should not eat and Capote take note of the rich foods on the tray, it almost seems fake, as if Capote knew how Brando was going to end up. But, of course, he didn't.

I'm going to learn about my own country.\\"  So he set out on a 3+ month journey with his dog to do just that.  Along the way, he met people and made conversation, observed the state of the country, and let his mind wander as he made his journey.  Then he returned to his mobile cabin at night and recorded the day's events.  These journal entries became \\"Travels with Charley.\\"<br />Overall, Steinbeck seems to paint a pretty picture.  While driving through New England in the fall, he is taken with the brilliant foliage on display.  He is much impressed with Wisconsin, and says about Montana, \\"I am in love.  For other states I have admiration, respect, recognition, even some affection, but with Montana it is love.\\"  Later, Steinbeck also speaks glowingly of the California Redwoods.<br />Steinbeck also has nice things to say about the American people - sometimes.  He notes that midwesterners are openly friendly, and again praises Montana, for its inhabitants \\"had time...to undertake the passing art of neighborliness.\\"  However, interspersed throughout his journey, Steinbeck encounters many things which are not so delightful.  In fact, some were quite upsetting.  He talks of waste - \\"American cities are like badger holes, ringed with trash\\" - and of miserable people  - \\"(some people) can drain off energy and joy, can suck pleasure dry and get no sustenance from it.  (They) spread a grayness in the air about them.\\"  (This was his opinion of a waitress Steinbeck had just met in Maine.)  And the waitress wasn't the only one.<br />Along his journey, he met many close-minded, opinionated, bigoted and rascist Americans, and it made for depressing reading.  I don't think Steinbeck was quite prepared for it.  I believe he had an idealized vision of a great trip, but in reality, it wasn't, and it took a lot out of him.  By the end Steinbeck was burned out and wanted nothing more than to get back home.  After California he went straight through to Texas, and then to New Orleans, where he encountered rascism at its worst.  That seemed to be the last straw for him.  After that, he blew off the rest of the southeast US and went back to New York.  He had had enough.<br />Jay Parini, who wrote the introduction, notes this ominous feeling.  He states that the book is filled with \\"whimsical vignettes, charm, etc., but beneath its surface there is a sense of disenchantment that turns to anger.\\"  He goes on to say that Steinbeck \\"is never quite able to bring himself to say that he was often disgusted by what he saw.\\"  But there's no question that he was.<br />Still, this was a very good book.  And it's not demoralizing from start to finish.  There are many humors adventures as well - his discussions with border guards near Canada being the most memorable.  But one can't help but feel that Steinbeck was sorry he'd gone.  He had a pre-conceived notion of what America was, and when it didn't meet his expectations, he was crushed.  \\"Travels with Charley\\" brilliantly captures what Steinbeck reluctantly learned - that you can't go home again.<br />Four stars.By the end Steinbeck was burned out and wanted nothing more than to get back home.

Along the way, you meet many people who enriched Dean's life and who, in turn, were enriched by him...there's Michael Jordan, of course, but Dean also reveals details of his relationships with a number of his players, associates and opponents, including John Thompson, James Worthy, and Frank McGuire, to name a few.<br />To his credit, he avoids speaking negatively about others.  It seems that he was operating under the axiom, &quot;if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.&quot;  This would explain the virtual omission of Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski - glaring by its absence.  So be warned - those looking for a mud-slinging expose' will be disappointed.<br />But that's OK - Dean showed that he didn't have to write a &quot;tell-all&quot; in order to write a good book.  It's just a story of a simple Kansas boy who found a way to make a difference in people's lives.  And what's wrong with that?<br />Rating: 4 stars.	2002-03-30

Ahmed Rashid provides a detailed and thorough account of how and why the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan, what was keeping them in power and what the ramifications might be if they stayed in power.  One startling statement appearing in the last chapter was this:<br />\\"But if the war in Afghanistan continues to be ignored we can only expect the worst.\\"<br />September 11, 2001 fulfilled this prophecy, probably in a way not even Rashid imagined.<br />The book was written as a current events work, but as the Taliban have been deposed and defunct since November/December 2001, this is, for the most part, a history book.  However, it is vital history.  To those who ask themselves (in reference to 9/11), \\"how and/or why did this happen?\\" - you should read this book.  You will be amazed at the level of involvement of not only the USA, but of many other countries as well.  Most alarming was Pakistan's role in helping and sustaining the Taliban (Pakistan is supposed to be an ally of the USA), even after it became apparent that the Taliban leaders were intolerant and unreasonable.  But Pakistan is not alone - Saudi Arabia and even the USA played a role in creating the Taliban monster as well.  How?  Read the book!<br />Rating:  Four stars - very informative, but also a little dry (this is history, after all).	2002-01-30

But there's nothing great about it either.<br />It is a love story set, obviously, at the dawn of America's entry into WW II. But it also the story of two best friends who get separated when one volunteers to help the British fight the Germans. The remaining friend and the girlfriend then strike up their own friendship, which becomes complicated when the volunteer returns to the US. When he finds out what's gone on, well...let's just say the war isn't the only fighting that occurs! And, oh yeah, right about this time the Japanese decide to attack the US, further complicating matters for the trio!<br />Overall, this was a decent book. However, I have read a few other historical fiction works recently (\\"The Gates of Fire,\\" \\"Rise to Rebellion\\"), and there is a definite drop-off in quality between those works and this one. Again, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" isn't bad, but I was left with the feeling that it could have been much better.<br />Three stars.	2002-01-06

Shaara's style (if you are not aware) is to tell a story from the point of view of some of the participants themselves.  In &quot;Rise to Rebellion,&quot; he chooses four individuals from the American side (Samuel and John Adams, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington) and one from the English (Thomas Gage).  Through these people, and others, we witness some of the events and turning points that led to the Declaration of Independence.<br />Because there is so much background from which to choose concerning the origins of American thoughts on liberty (the writs of assistance, the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, etc.), it seems that Shaara decided to &quot;settle&quot; with beginning at the Boston Massacre and proceeding from that point forward.  Interestingly enough, the first character the listener meets is not any of the aforementioned giants but a simple soldier named Hugh White, who happened to be standing guard the day of the Boston Massacre.  Through him, you experience the lonliness of sentry duty (e.g., what might run through a sentry's mind as he tries to keep warm?).  Then, slowly, you are taken through a whirlwind of happenings and before you realize it, you have just witnessed the Massacre!  It is at this juncture that John Adams appears, and before long you are introduced to Sam Adams, Gage, Franklin and the rest.<br />I thouroughly enjoyed this book but I would like to mention that not everything is covered here (not that Shaara is to blame - a lot happened!).  For example, although Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson make appearances, it is only for brief periods.  But again, Shaara really can't be blamed for this.  He obviously chose to concentrate on a few individuals and &quot;stay&quot; with them for large parts of the book.  That worked well enough.<br />I would also say that Shaara's narration also worked (those times when the story was not being told from any particular person's point of view).  His blow-by-blow version of what happened at the battles of Lexington and Concord were very moving - I had to stop the CD and think, because I actually had a weird feeling inside - like I just witnessed the &quot;point of no return&quot; between America and England.  It is writing like this that has won Shaara many fans - myself included - and I will now wait impatiently for the upcoming sequel!<br />Highly recommended...four stars!Shaara's narration also worked (those times when the story was not being told from any particular person's point of view).

Set in apartheid South Africa, the white &quot;haves&quot; control virtually everything, while the black &quot;have nots&quot; are a subjugated people.  But the blacks revolt, and the country is in chaos.  July, the long-time black servant of the white Smalls family, takes pity on them and guides them to his own, out-of-the-way village (and safety).<br />In effect, July has gone from servant to savior, and the change in roles is not lost on him.  He realizes the new importance he has gained, and begins to assert that authority.  Before long, July sets his sights on the Smalls' family car.  Because the Smalls' cannot drive it without risking capture and death, July assumes the role of driver, and soon, he is taking it out for errands without asking the Smalls' permission.  This does not sit well with the Smalls who, despite their predicament, still see July as their servant (and he would never have done such a thing back home)!  This is just one of many little conflicts, either real or imagined, that occur between the displaced Smalls and their host, July.<br />I would say this was an &quot;OK&quot; book, but there are two items I must mention that did not thrill me.  First, the book does not have much happening in the way of actual events.  It is a short book, and I suppose that's part of the reason.  But even so, relatively little happens here.  The Smalls have a few adventures, like meeting July's family and the other villagers, and later, meeting July's tribal chief.  But there's not much beyond those events.  Again, Gordimer devotes most of the book to how the characters react to their new situation, rather than creating additional ones.<br />Secondly, although it has been noted elsewhere, I must mention the use of punctuation in the book.  Gordimer uses dashes (-) where many other marks should be (&quot;, ;, :, etc.).  This made for difficult reading at first, but I will say that I did, eventually, become accustomed to it.  I would recommend reading it in as few sittings as possible, however; otherwise, every time you pick up the book, you will have to &quot;re-acquaint&quot; yourself with Gordimer's writing style.  I confess I did not like this style.  More than once I found myself re-reading entire paragraphs, or even pages, because I wasn't sure which character had just spoken, or to whom.  I don't find that &quot;artistic,&quot; as others have written; just annoying.<br />(But don't let that be the deciding factor of whether or not you'll read it; as I mentioned, you will get used to it after a few pages.)<br />Final rating: three stars.

His descriptions of &quot;the Spartan way&quot; and the workings of their society bring to life vivid mental pictures of how it might have been.  And the humanity Pressfield breathes into the characters - this is excellent work!  Beginning with the central figure and narrator, Xeo, through all the ensuing ones the reader encounters...by the end of the story, I couldn't help but feel that I knew them.<br /><br />Pressfield devotes much of the book to the Battle of Thermopylae itself, but a good deal is also spent laying groundwork for the battle.  There is also something of a love story woven throughout, but it is an unrequited love at best and doesn't detract too much from the main storytelling.  The focus is squarely on the Spartans - why they thought the way they did, why they lived the way they did, and most of all, why they chose to die the way they did.<br />It would seem to be a herculean task to place the reader into an ancient (and foreign) world and do it in such a way that the reader barely realizes it, but Pressfield has done just that.  I didn't feel like I was reading about some long-forgotten warriors or about some event from a history book - I felt like I was reading about people, REAL people.  It is a testament to Pressfield's ability as a writer to take such an event as an ancient battle and wrap around it a riveting narrative.<br />If you are at all interested in ancient history and/or military history, you will not be disappointed.  Not in the least.	2001-09-20

But I can tell you this...he didn't win it on the strength of this effort (published 1989).  The book tells the &quot;story&quot; of the last seven months in the life of General Simon Bolivar, the &quot;Liberator&quot; of South America from Spanish rule.  But it's not much of a story.  Suffering from various ailments, the General sails down the Magdalena River and visits various ports-of-call along the way.  A large entourage is in tow, and they do mostly nothing but play cards and complain about their inactivity and apparent aimlessness.  After seven months, Bolivar finally succumbs to what ails him, and dies.  And to be honest...that's really about it.<br />Now, to augment the story, Marquez heavily relies on the &quot;flashback&quot; technique, and he certainly needed to, because otherwise this book wouldn't have been more than 20 pages.  Through flashbacks, the reader learns about various events in Bolivar's life, and meets many of the people with whom he crossed paths.  But because these are flashbacks, these people/characters don't really play a central part in the story.  They just appear in a flashback, and very often are not seen or heard from again.  This made for very frustrating reading, and it left this reader wondering what the point of all this was...<br />I would also have to say the usage of flashbacks became annoying after a while, too.  I would be reading for a few pages, and then something inconsequential would happen, but it would spur Bolivar to start babbling about some Queen (or other personage) with whom he had relations...and six pages later I'm saying to myself: &quot;what was that all about?&quot;  It happened too often, in my opinion, and I found myself waiting/hoping for the book to be over (and that is not the sign of a good book).<br />But this wasn't a dismal effort, either.  Those curious about Bolivar (&quot;the man&quot; - as opposed to &quot;the myth&quot;) should find it interesting.  I say this because Marquez, although very fond of Bolivar, doesn't try to put him on a pedastal.  Here Bolivar is shown cursing often (something for which he was notorious), having a poor temper, being a sore loser, and showing an incredible ability to be contradictory at times.  In short,  Marquez shows Bolivar to be what he truly was - human.  And for me, this salvaged the book to a large degree.<br />Still not a tremendous work, but it was, at times, an entertaining read.Those curious about Bolivar (&quot;the man&quot; - as opposed to &quot;the myth&quot;) should find it interesting.

It will also be my last.  It has been well documented that Roth used this book as a vehicle to tell &quot;his side&quot; of his divorce battle with his ex-wife.  That's fine, I guess.  But for someone who is looking for a good story, and is not interested in how Roth is going to make his ex-wife look bad, it doesn't work as well.<br />I had been told that Roth was an excellent writer.  I will have to continue to take people at their word, because this book does not prove that claim.  Several fellow book club members commented on the serious lack of any female character development, charging that this was a &quot;male-orientated&quot; book.  That may or may not be true.  Either way, it is not necessary for that to be included to make a book worthwhile; still, if you are looking for something which contains that element, steer clear of this one.<br />However, I didn't find the book awful or unreadable, as some others have claimed.  The setting and Roth's description of historical events definitely made for some interesting reading.  Those even vaguely interested in &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and &quot;black-listing&quot; will most likely not be disappointed.<br />Having said that, I do have to state that I wasn't floored by this effort.  Maybe because it wasn't what I expected, or maybe because I found it hard to sympathize with the main character.  Whatever it was, I can tell you this:  it's no page-turner.  Most people I've talked with, including some Roth aficionados, acknowledge that this is not Roth's best effort.  In closing, I would say &quot;I Married a Communist&quot; would not be my first choice for the casual reader;  Roth fans, however, are likely to be satisfied, though maybe not ecstatic.	2001-07-16
