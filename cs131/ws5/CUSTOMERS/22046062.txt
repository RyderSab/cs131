I *love* this cookbook.  It is gorgeous (with many full color photos), and the recipes are clearly written to ensure success.  This is a famous Harlem church, and contains many wonderful stories and anecdotes.  But be assured that the book will appeal to anyone with taste buds, regardless of race.  (I'm caucasian, and love it). <br /> <br />There are many recipes from Carole Darden Lloyd, whose wonderful Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine is one of my all-time favorite cookbooks.  And you'll find recipes from names you'll recognize and admire, as well as those you won't know, but who are sensational cooks generously sharing their treasured dishes.  Most contributors described why their recipes are so wonderful -- and the church carefully tested them. <br /> <br />Don't miss this one!  It is truly outstanding.	2005-10-13

Despite mentioning both Julia Child and recipes in the title, this is definitely neither a cookbook nor a useful companion to Ms. Child's masterpiece.  If you want to read page after page of small print, it may be marvelous, but I was expecting a useful, practical companion to Child's cookbook, and it very definitely wasn't that.	2005-10-01

Although I still have my original Cuisinart, and don't use it very much (although it is indispensable for some things), even *I* find this cookbook indispensable! The recipes are well-tested and unfailingly delicious ... I don't think you can go wrong with a Norene Gilletz recipe.  And the directions are crystal clear, showing how to use your food processor in the best possible way. <br /> <br />One reviewer complained that there are too many Jewish recipes. Huh? I'm Christian, and the recipes are awesome for any palate.  These are dishes you could proudly serve anyone and receive nothing but compliments ... You can't help but love them, and the directions virtually ensure success.  Accordingly, while Kosher is obviously important to Jewish cooks, the recipes are appealing and delicious for any palate. <br /> <br />Although there are millions of cookbooks published each year, only a handful offer delectable, tried-and-true, well-tested recipes which are very clearly written and almost guarantee success.  In addition, this wonderful book shows you how to get the most out of your food processor.  It is a marvelous addition to any kitchen, and perfect for anyone who cooks.  Highest possible recommendation!	2005-09-05

This book was a huge disappointment, and I returned my copy.  As the recipes are divided by Inn, main dishes, side dishes, breakfasts, breads, desserts are totally mixed together.  The print is small and pale.  Worse, it does not include any comments to indicate that the recipes are tried-and-true, or what makes them special -- and they don't appear to have even been tested by the authors.  There are a number of outstanding cookbooks featuring the best recipes from B&Bs, and the others are sorted by subject (so all cakes will be together, etc.),  include the innkeepers' comments about why they're so special, were tested by the authors, and include the authors observations.

It is filled with tried-and-true, well-tested candy recipes clearly written to ensure success, and prefaced by complete descriptions of why they're so special.  My only quibble (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that it has the worst index on the planet (e.g., Luscious Raspberry Fudge Truffles aren't under R for Raspberry, F for fudge, C for chocolate, or T for Truffles, but L for Luscious --which you may not remember is in the name when looking for the recipe), and includes every possible version of every candy, rather than those that taste the best.

Don't waste your money!<br /><br />There are more tips and better directions in basic quilling books ... This was a total waste of money.<br /><br />The entire book does not even mention roses.  I could see the purist approach eschewing punches, but surely folded and spiral roses belong here.<br /><br />For fringing, it just directs the reader to fringe.  Huh?  No mention of the best type of scissors for this, the ease of bulldog clips, or commercial fringers.<br /><br />Those are the things beginners need to know!<br /><br />It shows shapes, but most of the directions are in the individual projects.  Beginners would find it much more helpful to see all basic shapes and how to make them.<br /><br />Five pages are wasted on a \\"Children's Gallery\\", comprised of colored photos of shapes made by kids.

I'm a huge fan of Beverly Nye, and her first three cookbooks are among my all-time favorites.  However, although this book is good, I don't think it is up to her usual standards.  According to her (...) it was self-published with the first printing in 2003 -- waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too late to have just written \\"1 can tomatoes\\", etc., with no hint as to size/weight.  This may be petty, but I, myself, would much prefer having the recipes sorted by type (Breads/Salads/Desserts...), rather than months.  However, if they have to be divided by months, the index or table of contents could have been vastly improved (e.g., listing the recipe titles in alphabetical order, rather than by page number).  I would also have much preferred to read the hints and quotes separately, rather than by month.  However, the bottom line is that the hints, quotes, and recipes are all excellent, and anything this author does is well worth reading and learning from.	2005-06-05

However, it is currently selling for over $40 plus shipping - which is utterly ridiculous.  For that price, you'd be much better advised to purchase a few of Maria Adams's cookbooks, filled with tried-and-true Amish and Mennonite favorites which were collected and tested by the author.  I'm not putting down Ms. Yoder's book; just pointing out that it is a small book which was never intended to sell for big bucks.

I was also annoyed to find numerous seafood recipes in a cookbook that claims to be vegetarian.

That's the good news.  The bad news is that many recipes are just doctored up cake mixes/canned fillings (which is not what anyone I know would give a gift), and a disproportionate number contain Cool Whip and/or require refrigeration, and will only last for a day or so -- but the author gives no hint about how long to keep things.  Refrigerated items (such as dips) are bad enough in a cookbook intended for gift-giving, but they are mixed in with the other recipes -- so, if you're trying to find something to mail or travel with, you'll have to go through the entire book, looking at the bottom of each recipe.  What a pain!  Also, it has one of the worst indexes I've ever seen - so, if you find something you want to try, affix a post-it note.	2005-05-24

This book contains tried-and-true recipes, with all the tips and tricks necessary to ensure success.  Everything I've tried has been delectable, with such clear step-by-step instructions that it would be hard to fail. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the tips are interspersed with the recipes, making it a bit cumbersome to follow.

Since 99% of the recipes are from test kitchens rather than famous people, the title is misleading, if not false advertising.  Although it does contain many recipes from famous women, there are countless celebrity cookbooks and even online sites -- and the good ones all include something from the celeb telling why that particular recipe is special to them.  This book doesn't even bother to do that.  Moreover, the print is very small (and green).  I ordered this along with _Mom's Secret Recipe File_ -- which was cheaper and is far superior.  Celebrity cookbooks are great fun; this just doesn't happen to be one of the good ones.  Although I own well over a thousand cookbooks, I'm returning this one.  A total waste of money!	2005-05-02

This is a big book - with teensy print that is more grey than black (and thus hard to read).  It is also very difficult to find recipes.  The table of contents merely cites broad things like Southern, Main Dish, One Dish, and Desserts, and the index is totally useless (e.g., Vegetables includes Shrimp, Chicken, Pot Roast, and Brisket, but no vegetables).  I gave up trying to find if veggies were even listed.  It doesn't even include comments from the contributors as to why they think their recipe is special.  Amazon has zillions of wonderful cookbooks for sale.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Despite the hefty price tag, it is pure trash.	2005-02-07

For example, the recipe for Vegetarian Cholent says to add water to reach top of crockpot - but crockpots come in a variety of sizes, so this could turn out very watery and bland if using a much larger pot than the author's.  Surely the recipe should either state what size crockpot the author uses, or mention the amount of water she adds, so those of us with different-sized crockpots can make necessary adjustments. <br /> <br />Likewise, it would have been helpful if the recipe gave a hint as to how many people it serves.

Magnificent (like everything the author does).  My only quibble (and the reason I didn't give it five stars) is that the descriptions of the recipes and what makes them special appear in a chapter preceding the recipes, rather than above each recipe -- and the recipes are organized by family event, rather than type.

Thank goodness I bought it from Amazon so can return it.  All those recipes but no hints about why they're special -- and there's a vast difference between recipes you treasure because they contain ingredients that are readily available, because they're cheap, because they're quick and easy, and because they're delectable.  I like to know which is which before spending my time and money, and this book provides no hints. It could have been cranked out from any sterile test kitchen.  I prefer tried-and=true recipes that tell you why they're treasured. <br /> <br />The crafts are even worse.  For example, a \\"new or recycled\\" picture frame to which you glue birdseed and hang it on a bush or tree.  A *NEW* picture frame?  Yeah, right.  Is this book intended for the Rockefellers?  I feed birds every day, but they'd rather have me spend my money on birdseed than on picture frames! <br /> <br />What a waste!	2004-09-04
