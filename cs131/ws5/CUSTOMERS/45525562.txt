It is a story of murderous men who took what they wanted and simply killed anyone who got in their way.  The killers described in this book killed police officers as casually as little boys stomp on ants.  No one, it seemed, was going to stop them.  The FBI did.  And FBI agents died in the process.  The Bureau was thrown into a job it was not prepared for, but it learned the hard way and eventually it won.  Burroughs shows the FBI struggling in its infancy but he has genuine respect for these men who had to work 15 hours a day and face sub-machine gun wielding bank robbers.   <br />He is fair to the FBI.  He is fair to its leader, J. Edgar Hoover.  He is even fair to the murderers whose crimes got the FBI \\"thrown\\" into the job of national manhunts.  There is so much information here and it is told briskly and interestingly.  This is the kind of book which should win awards, but never seems to do so.  This is an epic story of two years in America.  Forget the other books about Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson and the others.  Just read this one and you will know what happened.	2004-08-10

If most of the people reporting the news lean one way politically, that is important news in itself and Mr. Bozell makes it clear that most media people and organizations lean to the left.

Mr. Hill clears up a few mysteries left behind by the movie story, such as who killed whom, etc. The second half of the book, in which Mr. Hill describes his life after he left the gangster business, is boring as can be.  He takes drugs, cheats on his wife, takes drugs, cheats on his wife, takes....on and on and on. He still ends up in jail now and then and spends a lot of time in drug rehab centers.<BR>The writing thoughout the entire book is amateurish, repetitive, and poorly edited.  You frequently have to mentally fill in words that were apparently left out.<BR>If you want a good insider gangster story, this is not it. This is simply someone cashing in on his notoriety.	2004-06-07

I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone who has not read the book yet, so I will just say that the most glaring problem is that the combination of hard nosed action and supernatural horror is not well done.  So much time is spent in the first two thirds of the book convincing us that the bad men are such skilled, vicious killers that everyone should fear them.  But,when the bad men finally reach the island, they are not up against human beings for the most part and their murderous ways become almost pointless, because they can't kill the supernatural beings that attack them.  The author created a heck of a build up to a roaring cops and bad guys showdown, then started telling another kind of story.  <BR>This type of story can be done well, however.  Dean Koontz combines the police, bad guys, mortal threat, and the supernatural in a splendid manner in &quot;Odd Thomas.&quot;    Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly doesn't pull it off.	2004-03-29

This is the tale of a cop at the bottom of the food chain. He didn't make a lot of money.  He didn't get a lot of glory, because he operated undercover and kept his identity hidden from the public.  He went into terribly dangerous corners of New York City because he was dedicated and he loved being a policeman. One of those big shots had been big too long.  He had become arrogant and morally corrupt.  He had reached such a point of <BR>self importance that he no longer had any respect for the real cops out on the streets. He engaged in a terrible battle of wits, will, and nerve with the hero of this true story.  The good cop does not exactly win in the end, but he comes pretty darn close and he sure as hell does not lose.  The drama and tension of this real life police story is fantastic. The story's pace is fast.  The characters are vividly portrayed.  You either want to salute them or spit on them.  This isn't just a good cop book.  It is, simply, a very good book about people.	2003-12-29

It has a likable main character, some very likable secondary characters, and a villain it is almost fun to fear and despise. Koontz handles the supernatural/horror angle of the story with a light hand.  The story is driven by the characters, not weird stuff or strange beings, although the weird stuff and strange beings are definitely around.  Placing this story in a small, rather isolated town in southern California was a masterstroke.  It gives the story that old fashioned feel of a few lonely people facing tremendous mystery and danger, sort of like the book/movie &quot;The Body Snatchers&quot;.  If you have become wary of Koontz's books lately, relax and give this one a try.  He doesn't preach at the reader in this one.  He tells the story tightly and quickly.  In short, it's the kind of book you know you should put down for the night and go to bed, but you don't.  It's just too interesting, and besides, a quiet house in which everyone but you is asleep is the perfect setting for reading this story.	2003-12-12

The professional and readers' reviews on this page do that.  I want to comment on the flow of the plot and the characters which inhabit it.  This book moves very slowly.  There is very little tension. What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that?  There can be no real resolution of these matters because the reader knows that virtually everyone in the town of Pompeii will soon die when the volcano erupts.  The characters might have been able to carry the reader along if they had been interesting, exciting people.  But, they are cliches.  The completely evil villain; the sad, ever moral good guy.  And they talk and talk and talk.  Until the last third of the book, there is virtually no action in this supposed thriller.

I think the guy  murdered his friend and managed to get off with a virtual slap on the wrist. You might come to a different conclusion after reading this rather short book, and that's fine. Just do yourself a favor and read it. The victim, the suspect, the cops, the lawyers, and a collection of friends and family members come across not only as real people, the kind you might meet at a bus stop, but also as interesting people. The description of the desert is brutal.  The description of the crime is fascinating.  The story moves quickly.  You are finished before you know it. <BR>There is one glaring fault. The editing is terrible.  All through the book, sentences pop up with a word missing. Even so, what the author meant is clear and the story still glides along.<BR>This is an excellent, true story told excellently.	2003-08-07

Chapter One grabs your attention with a character who is, at first glance, extremely interesting.  The character, an out of work, banned-by-the-studios cowboy actor in the nineteen-forties, is reduced to being a collector/leg breaker for a gambler.  He discovers that his former step-daughter may be in serious danger.  <BR>With Chapter Two, the story really slows down, with the character becoming yet another amateur detective who isn't really very tough plodding through a typical murder mystery.

It is nothing like the other two novels Ledwidge wrote, stories that were tightly woven around a few characters whose decisions and mistakes drastically changed their lives.<BR>\\"Before the Devil....\\" relies not on tight plotting, but on major coincidence after major coincidence, all stacked in a row from one chapter to the next.  The story is so dependent on coincidences, I can't give examples without giving away the plot to those who want to discover it for themselves. <BR>Sure, this is fiction, but Ledwidge gives us no chance to enjoy a story we can believe might have actually occurred. He can write like the \\"devil\\", though.  Check out his first two novels in paperback. Think twice before shelling out twenty bucks for this one.	2003-01-09

The historical information is great and the descriptions of places in 1920s Germany are splendid.  Mr. Nagorski is a fine writer.  He just isn't a very good novelist.  There isn't a lot of dialogue in \\"Last Stop Vienna\\" and what is there does not ring true. (Putting words into the mouth of a monster such as Adolph Hitler requires incredible novelistic ability to make those words believable.)<BR>The fights between storm troopers and their opponents have no sting to them.  Again, it is as if you are reading a dry work of history. Mr. Nagorski creates some interesting characters, and he has an interesting plot line.  He just wasn't able to bring the people or the story to life.	2002-12-30

I just want to say that it is not a very good one.  It breezes along like an old Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew story---amazing coincidences popping up everywhere, stilted dialogue slipping from every character's tongue, and action sequences which are unrealistic to the point of being downright silly.<BR>Years ago, Follett wrote three great action/suspense novels: Eye of the Needle, The Key to Rebecca, and Triple.

But, the book's title says it all:  BUSH at war.  President Bush is the hero of this story, whether Woodward intended for him to be the hero or not.  Bush is also intelligent, hard working and emotional. However, he had the worst job of anyone involved in the aftermath of the terrorist attack on America.  He showed more than intelligence.  He showed intellectual courage.  He made decisions and stuck to them, even when his advisors were trying to move in different directions. He cut through the confusion and anger and fear and made hard choices. He showed the entire world what America's leadership was made of:  Determination and guts.<BR>Woodward's writing is splendid.  It speeds you along through the days after the attack.  The words and actions of Bush and his deputies are heartening and, sometimes, inspiring.<BR>The close-up of Bush's spontaneous response to the rescue worker at the World Trade Center is almost worth the price of this book by itself.  You want to know what George Bush did and said in private and compare that to what he did in public?  You want to decide if the man we just barely elected president deserves the job?

The constant filthy language, the neverending nonsense about the Rogue's own personal ten commandments, the always present, always identical, comments on pain and winning that meander through action scenes:  It has all become boring.

There is really no new information here, just a few different interpretations of that info.  <BR>I had hoped, when I opened this book, that I would find a brand new take on the life of this fascinating general.

The story in &quot;Red Rabbit&quot; fills a gap in our knowledge of Ryan's life.  However, Clancy could have done a lot better by Ryan. This novel is talky to the point of being tedious.  The characters, American, British, and Russian, seem to say the same things again and again.  And talk is about all the story consists of.<BR>That snapping, twisting action and suspense that we have come to expect of Clancy is missing here.  Part of the problem, of course, is that we already know that the Pope, who was attacked in the nineteen-eighties, survived the assassination attempt.  The other part of the problem is that Clancy does not create any real suspense in the process of giving us his fictional version of how it all occurred.  <BR>In fact, the plot is ponderous and stretched far too thinly.  Clancy wrote an extremely good novel once about the spy game between America and Russia.  It's called &quot;The Cardinal of the Kremlin.&quot;  If you are not a big Jack Ryan devotee, but you want to read Tom Clancy when his writing and plotting crackled with tension, try &quot;Cardinal of the Kremlin.&quot;  You won't regret it.	2002-08-09

This is the story of how they did it in 1913, this business of sailing onto great bodies of water, without the benefit of weather satellites, radar, and around-the-world-signal radios.

His marvelous imagination is absent in this tale.  Instead, he relies on dumb, drastically overused stereotypes for characters (the pyscho, racist, Vietman veteran vs. the sweet, kind, liberal writer who belives in reincarnation and could never, ever hurt anything or anyone)and a hokey, overused \\"I'll chase you through the woods and kill you\\" plotline.<BR>It's obvious why Vietman vets might be disgusted by this book, but Matheson didn't do any favors for the sweet, kind liberal writer types out there, either.  The one in this story is so wimpy and outright dumb that it is difficult to find him believable.  The writer, who is also the victim, goes along for a three day backpacking trip through a national forest.  When his guide, the evil veteran, becomes verbally abusive, the writer meekly puts up with it.  After all, how would he find his way out of the forest, he wonders.  But, they are on a marked trail at that point in the story, and it is a forest in California, not a jungle in a foreign country.  The guy could have easily turned around and returned to the highway they started from.<BR>Matheson throws in a little pornography along the way...  He tosses in a murder.  He even provides sound advice on the subject of long backpacking trips through the woods.  <BR>But it is all pointless, written, it seems, only to fill the pages with something.  This is not the Richard Matheson his fans have come to enjoy.  If you must read this book, out of loyalty to Matheson, if for no other reason, wait for the paperback.  The hardcover just isn't worth the twenty bucks or so.	2002-07-09

The brother suddenly appears out of nowhere, and within a week's time has nearly murdered the architect and has very much succeeded in kidnapping the architect's family, then disappearing without a trace.  The \\"long lost\\" brother's tale of where he had been for so many years just doesn't ring true but the reader can swallow it to get to the pursuit part of the novel.  The pursuit, however, wherein the architect teaches himself to \\"think like his lost brother\\", is ridiculous.  It requires such a willingness to \\"suspend disbelief\\", as the literary folks say, that you might as well be reading a fantasy story about goblins or little green men.<BR>I won't go into detail about why the pursuit is silly, because I don't want to ruin the plot for new readers and fans of this author, but Morrell has asked us to do the impossible: Accept suspense that flies in the face of common sense.	2002-06-02

The feel of the early American West is on every page of this book.  The almost casual cruelty of a natural wilderness and the people who manage to survive in that wilderness is on display in McMurty's descriptions of the West.  The story moves quickly, sometimes too quickly:  Now and then, the various plot lines don't seem to be in sync with each other.  But, apparently, this is the &quot;set up&quot; book for the next three tales about these same people.  As some reviewers have complained, many of the characters are shallow, but most of them are supposed to be shallow.  The Berrybenders are a rich, arrogant clan who expected this &quot;new place&quot; to bow before them, and they don't quite realize that they are the ones, in this wild environment, who are the &quot;lower class&quot;, the people at the bottom of the food chain.  Mcmurty tries too hard for humor in this book, but he still tells a heck of a good story.  With the three books to follow, that story will only get better.	2002-05-24

The firemen whom Halberstam writes about have their own rules of honor, of conduct, and of loyalty.  In describing the twelve men from one New York City firehouse who died at the World Trade Center last Septmeber, Halberstam does more than tell us about their personalities and loves and ambitions.  He lets us enter the small world of the place where they worked.  Oddly enough, while the whole city of New York admired these firemen for the good they did and the risks they were willing to take, the firemen set themselves apart from the rest of New York,insulating themselves from the strife and disloyalty of daily life through the brotherhood of the firehouse.  Because you know from the first page that the main personalities all died heroically, this is a grim book, but if you want a glimpse into a world where men depend on each other to stay alive each and every day, read FIREHOUSE.	2002-05-23
US	45525562	R1TUSR9PGWQUUY	0446528315	120555351	3000 Degrees: The True Story of a Deadly Fire and the Men Who Fought It	Books	5	21	21	N	N	BAD BUILDING-TERRIBLE FIRE-BRAVE MEN	There is only one complaint to be made of this book: The picture on the dustjacket.  Instead of a photograph of someone dressed in fireman's gear, there should have been a photograph of the building described in the narrative, an enormous building with no windows, no easy paths, and, once it caught fire, no mercy.  It became a monster which took the lives of six firemen.  <BR>Sean Flynn does a great job in telling this story.  The book is relatively short, but Flynn does not shortchange the reader.  You turn the pages fast as Flynn provides brisk views of the firemen he writes about, giving us the flavor of their family lives and their personal ambitions, and then rushing on into the action and tragedy that are the centerpieces of the book.<BR>This is a true story, but Flynn writes as if it were a novel, letting us know what people were thinking and saying in a terrible situation.  He is able to do this because he has researched the story so well.  (It began as a story for Esquire magazine.)<BR>The descriptions of the desperate attempts to save the six firemen who became lost in the mazes of the fiery Worcester Cold Storage building are some of the best true-life action sequences you are likely to encounter in a book.  Flynn describes the aftermath of the fire eloquently, relating the sorrow, guilt, and pride felt by the surviving firefighters, and just as important, the heartbreak of the families the heroes left behind.    <BR>Before the Worcester Cold Storage building ever caught fire, one of the firemen in this book looked at the towering thing, imagined it on fire, and said, &quot;Bad Building.&quot;  It seems he was right.  <BR>Bad building.  Hell of a good book.	2002-04-01
US	45525562	R1B156DIGCRELI	0743405935	310710828	Bad Connection	Books	5	5	5	N	N	One of the best thrillers on the bookshelves	Michael Ledwidge writes thrillers that are a combination of three types of stories: tough guy novels, literary novels, and morality tales.  \\"Bad Connection\\" is a prime example of his particular talent for doing this.  It's a story about a rich man and a poor man, both of them basically good people, but both overcome by greed.  Neither of them is the violent type, but when the two of them collide as the poor man goes after what the rich one has, they both lose control of the situation.   Hard men become involved and terrible trouble descends on everyone. Ledwidge is brief with character development, but this seems to be not because he is unskilled, but because he gives the reader a great deal of credit for imagination.  Ledwidge lays out the cornerstones of character, deftly lays on the bricks of the plot, and allows the reader to race around the pages, wanting to know if the whole thing will collapse on someone.  The plot is fast moving, the dialogue sounds real, and the climax is not what you would expect it to be. What more could you ask of a thriller?	2002-03-11
US	45525562	RA941U60VJW1K	0345411463	587156594	Eureka	Books	1	1	3	N	Y	A Fast Start  To A Slow Ride	Eureka kicks off in high speed, with interesting characters, well written action scenes, and the promise of a fascinating plot.  This lasts for about 150 pages.  From there on, the plot becomes tedious, as a murder investigation takes center stage.  That investigation moves very slowly, and the author's writing loses the sharpness it had at the beginning. This novel is not so much an \\"epic story\\" as it is an \\"epic build-up\\" to a pedestrian crime novel.	2002-03-09
