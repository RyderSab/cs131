Being Human turned out to be, in my opinion, one of the best Star Trek: New Frontier novels he's written up to this point.  One thing I've always loved about the various post-original-series novels is the way in which they incorporate events and episodes from the Original Series.  Being Human does that in spades; in fact, it incorporates one of the more interesting of the early epsisodes.  Another great thing about this novel was the humor.  More often than not I found myself reading with a smirk on my face, and there were many times I was laughing out loud.  Peter David also does a great job of expanding the relationships between crew members while at the same time creating realtionships with a whole new set of crew members from Shelby's Starship Trident.  Excellent work and a fun read.	2005-09-12

In later years I have no doubt his Shannara series of books will be considered classics of their time.  That being said, I think it might be time for Brooks to move on.  He has mined the Ohmsfords for just about everything they have to offer.  Don't get me wrong, High Druid of Shannara was a very readable, very enjoyable series but didn't really offer much new information.  Granted, entering The Forbidding was an interesting plot point, but wasn't really developed as well as it could have been.  With Straken, Brooks bring the High Druid of Shannara series to a close, and possibly closes the book on the Ohmsford clan (which is not a bad thing).  Again, the story was exciting, adventurous, and even though the ending of major plot points happened a little too easily I still enjoyed the novel.  Brooks has always been an author who creates interesting and easily readable novels, and Straken is no exception.	2005-09-10

Kevin Anderson has done a fabulous of creating some of the most interesting extraterrestrials to come along since, well, ET.  The ages long battle between the verdani, the hydrogues, the faeros, and the wentals is still original and fascinating to read.  The most interesting of the humanoid characters continues to be the Ildirans.  Again, Anderson has created not only an interesting society, but an original concept.  By the end of the story, the Ildirans have been through hell and back.  When it's all said and done, their loyalties are left in the balance.  Among the humans, the Terran Hansiatic Leqgue continues to be the bullies of the universe, but again Anderson has a great villian in the form of Chairman Basil Wenceslas. His ongoing battle with the less than subserviant King Peter is turning into quite an interesting plot development.  Trouble is brewing and I can't wait to see how it all turns out.  If I had to say something negative about the novel, it would be the lack of plot development.  I'm glad Anderson has an end already in sight.  I'd hate for the Saga of the Seven Suns to become the sci-fi Wheel of Time.	2005-08-15

In this book, Robert Jordan really pushes the plot forward, new and interesting characters step up, old characters reach new heights of development, and the plot reads like a great thriller, weaving new threads in the pattern.  The sad fact is, after the next book in the series -- The Shadow Rising -- the Wheel of Time starts to take a major downward spiral into mediocre plots (if you can call them plots), no character development, and a backstory that has become so convoluted that you almost want to give up.  Enjoy the first four books in this series, because the good is few and far between from that point foward.	2005-08-12

What's really sad about this \\"book\\" is the author.  Bernard Goldberg used to be a good journalist, but somewhere along the way he sold his soul to the devil of wingnut politics.  Even more sad is that this book was even published.  Yeah, I know HarperCollins is a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's NewsCorp, but this is bad even for them.  If Mr. Goldberg wants to look at who's screwing up America he needs to take a cold, hard look in the mirror.  Even a Conservative should be ashamed of this tripe.	2005-07-25

You know, Rowling gets a lot of flack for not writing great literature, but then when did a great book have to be great literature?  Sure, her plotting can get a bit ham-handed, but that doesn't destract from the overall joy of reading this great book.  Moreover, Rowling continues to become a better writer with each successive novel, and that's on display in Half-Blood Prince.  Granted, you knew who was going to die in the end -- the writing was written boldy on the wall, so to speak -- but getting there is quite a ride.  The danger is ratcheted up like never before, someone turns out to be a traitor, and even though any reader would had to have suspected it, once it happens you're just taken aback.  One of the great things about these novels has always been how Rowling writes the main characters.  She never forgets, even when danger surrounds them, that these young man and women are still kids.  Rowling allows them to make the usual teenage mistakes and mature because of it.  And yes, as the author warned us, a main character dies, and if any reader isn't emotional at that death there has to be something wrong with him or her.  I eagerly await the final novel in this series.  Lord Voldemort has some major payback coming to him.	2005-07-17

The plot was thin at best, didn't really kick in until about half way through, and some of the action seemed trite and forced. I also find myself getting tired of Sookie's constant moving from one Supe to another -- it really belittles such a great heroine. I also dislike the direction the author has taken with Bill. Over the last three books he has really turned into a horses behind -- an immature one at that. Overall, the book was OK and it will certainly bring me back to the next book in the series.	2005-07-10

With each book so far, Butcher has not only developed the character of Harry Dresden, Chicago's only Wizard for Hire, but the alternate universe in which he lives.  This time around, Harry has to deal with the repercussions of the war he started with the vampire Red Court, but also the wizard White Council -- who are none to happy with him -- and the Sidhe (fairies, although they don't like to be called that) Queens of Winter and Summer.  Butcher is treading a well-worn path here considering some of these same elements appear in Laurell K. Hamilton's work, but here Butcher is going for more of the mystery and politics than the sex and intrigue of Hamilton's writings, and it works.  Soon, Harry finds himself pulled into the political machinations of the Summer and Winter courts while at the same time trying to fend of an otherworldly assassin and protect his skin from the White Council.  The book runs along at a breakneck speed and the ending is well worth the trip.  I look forward to reading the next book in the series.	2005-06-12

As with so many of Benford's novels it's the combination of hard, factual science coupled with fantastic character development.  Yes, there are some stumbling points with the plot, but overall it's one exciting ride as the race to Mars unfolds; and once we get there it only gets more exciting.  I think another reason why I enjoyed this novel is that it's set in the not-so-ditant future and features science that is relevant to our present day.  Highly recommended.	2005-06-03

She's been able to create an original, interesting, Southern series that continues to be a joy to read.  Over these four books so far, Harris' character development has really improved. Sookie continues to grow as a character and is still fun to read.  I'll also give kudos to Harris' world-building as she delves deeper into the various supernatural characters that inhabit her alternate universe, especially the Were and shifter characters.  This time around Harris adds Wiccans and bad witches to the mix and they work very well.  In another development, Sookie develops a closer relationship with Bill's boss, Eric, which works better than I thought it would.  At the end of Club Dead, Bill and Sookie were on the outs and that continues with this book.  While I like Vampire Bill, his character was getting annoying by the end of Club Dead and I was disappointed in the direction Harris took the character.  While I hope he continues to stick around, I also hope Harris develops the relationship between Sookie and Eric.  I just hope she doesn't make the same mistake as Laurell K. Hamilton and develop a mnage--trois between Sookie, Eric, and some other character -- she certainly has enough suitors.	2005-05-31

In many ways it's like a classic mystery with your anti-hero private eye, Harry Dresden.  The only difference is, Harry happens to be a wizard -- a very powerful one at that.  Now, I know what you're thinking:  another mystery/detective series where the \\"real world\\" co-exists with magical beings, a la Meredith Genty/Anita Blake and the Southern Vampure Mysteries.  The only thing this novel has in common with those is the fantastical setting; otherwise, they are quite different.  Without the fantasy elements this could be any other hard-boiled mystery.  Being the first book in a series, Storm Front certainly had some faults, but overall it was quite good and I really enjoyed the main character of Harry Dresden, enough so that I plan to read that next few books in the series.	2005-05-09

They are a refreshing mix of mystery and horror in the vein of the Anita Blake novels (back before Anita became obsessed with nothing but sex, sex, sex).  I'm really drawn to the two main characters, Sookie and Bill.  In Sookie we have a great heroine who is reluctant to be a heroine.  In Bill we have an interesting vampire with a history that dates back to the Civil War.  With this novel we finally get to learn a little more about Bill's family -- his human family -- and what happened to their descendants.  What really irks me about these novels is the writing.  At times it is very immature and annoying.  Be that as it may, I've really enjoyed these novels and their Southern setting.  If you're looking for a new take on the vampire/mystery genre, check out these novels. <br />	2005-05-07

In this sequel, Weis tells the story of Melisande's sons who were born at the cost of their mother's life.  Ven, short for Vengeance, lives a life of near seclusion with Melisande's former lover, Bellona; Marcus, the (...) son of King Edward and Ven's half brother lives a life of luxary.  Of the two brothers, Ven is the better developed.  He must live a life of pvoerty and hard work hidden away from a world that would brand him demon because of the dragon legs that mark him as The Dragon's son.  Living with a woman who blames him for the death of her lover.  One of the main gripes I had with the previous novel was character development.  More often than not, the characters in Mistress of Dragons were wooden and poorly developed, which was a disappointment when you consider the world building and character development of Weis's work with Dungeons and Dragons.  In The Dragon's Son, Weis has greatly improved some of her characters.  Ven is, of course, her best creation.  There are times when you really feel the angst of this half human, half dragon child.  Weis also improved on the characters of Bellona and Draconis.  Bellona was one of the more wooden characters from the first novel, but Weis really creates an understated performance for her.  Overall, this was a vast improvement over Mistress of Dragons.  I looked forward to the third novel.	2005-04-25

Of course, the prequels have not been that great so far.  The Phantom Menance was a menance to watch, Attack of the Clones improved considerably but fell flat for the most part (especially in the Anakin/Padme love story).  Revenge of the Sith, however, looks to be just what George Lucas said it would be, Titanic in space.  Of course, we know what has to happen.  Certain events must play out in order to set up the story that began in A New Hope.  It's how we get to that point, and getting to that point should be quite good if this novel is any indicator.  What I disliked about this novelization, and why I could not give it more than 3 stars, is the poor writing by Matthew Woodring Stover.  It is choppy, immature, and poorly adapted.  I wish Lucas could have found a better writer, Terry Brooks for example who novelized The Phantom Menace.  Regardless of how Stover wrote this adaptation, if you're a fan of this film series the book is a must-have prior to the film's release next month.	2005-04-16

The plot is exciting, the action is non-stop, and the Celtic lore was very interesting.  Moreover, there were moments in this novel when I had to put the book down because could believe what had just happened.  People are maimed, women raped and murdered, entire nations put to the sword.  In fact, there were times when I thought the violence depicted went too far, but I also felt it was in keeping with the setting and alternate time period so it had to he accepted.  If I had to make one complaint about the novel, it's that the ending was tied up a little too neatly, but not so bad that I didn't thoroughly enjoy the novel.	2005-04-15

It has everything:  adventure. excitement, danger, deadly accidents, humor, sadness, Egyptology, and best of all the entire Emerson clan -- incuding Sethos, Walter and Evelyn, and the third generation of Emersons.  One of the things that has been missing from the last few novels in this series was the family dynamic.  The Emersons are at their best when everyone is working together to solve the latest mystery and having Walter and Evelyn along for the ride, even if it is often brief, only adds to the fun.  Add to this the addition of Sethos and his daughter and you got a rollicking good time.  This time around I actually have to give some kudos to Ms. Peters for a very well-written and plotted mystery that involves stolen jewels and the appearance of the Goddess Hathor.  One of the better developments in this novel is the return of the strong Nefret.  The last few novels had her acting immature and overly melodramatic; and while there are some of those moments in this story, overall she really has some opportunities to shine.  In addition to the adult Emersons, we also have a few funny and poingant moments with the third generation of Emersons:  Sennia, of course; Ramses and Nefret's children, David John and Charla; as well as David and Lia's children, Evvie and Dolly (short for Abdullah).  They look to bring back some of the fun that has been missing from the novels since Ramses grew up, especially Dolly and David John who are mostly likely destined to be the greatest of friends.  Overall, a fantastic read.  I'm only disappointed that I've now caught up with the author and won't be able to easily move on to the next novel (although the latest did just get published!).	2005-04-09

Of course, the plots are getting a little improbable with each novel, but hey we knew they were never meant to be fact, didn't we?  The plot of this novel is fast-paced, exciting, dangerous, adventuresome, and fun -- something that has been lacking in them for awhile (with a few exceptions here and there).  The Emersons are once again back in Egypt, their ever-increasing clan along for the ride, and even a new cat with a very ostentatious name.  Once again, the family improbably finds itself drawn into the military intelligence escapades that nearly took the life of Ramses in He Shall Thunder in the Sky.  Along the way we have some archaeological excavations, dead bodies, dangerous traps, and yes some more ruined shirts.  Not everything is perfect with this novel.  As stated before, the plots are getting over the top, some of the newer supporting characters are annoying (Jumana!), and Sethos just isn't as much fun as he used to be.  Since Peters outed him as the long lost half-brother of Radcliffe and Walter, he's lost some of that zing.  I will say that Selim has really started to grown on me.  He may never be Abdullah, but he is an interesting character. Beyond that, the novel was a lot of fun and a great return to the joy of previous novels.	2005-04-03

First, the mystery.  It just wasn't as exciting as previous novels.  That's happened before, but usually the family dynamic and archaeological aspects make up for it.  Which leads into the second reason why this was not so much fun: the lack of familial fun.  The family, Amelia and Emerson, Ramses and Nefret, are split into two different plots for much of the book.  This works against the story because their time apart is boring for the most part.  Third, is bringing Ramses and Nefret into adulthood, the author has bled some of the fun and attitude from the characters.  I'm perfectly willing the accept to former unrequited loves are blissfully happen now they are together, but this just to much.  Fourth, the lack of the usual supporting characters, chief among them David.  Those that were involved were just boring and forgettable, especially the formely-fun Gargery who acts more like a spoiled child than Sennia.  Several of the last few books have been hit and miss for me.  The older and adult verions of these characters aren't nearly as fun as they used to be.	2005-03-31

For me, this series jus hasn't been as fun since the children grew up, especially Ramses.  Pretty much since The Last Camel Died at Noon the series has spent far too much time dealing with unrequited love, family strife, and melodrama.  One of the draws for me with this series was always the archaeological aspects of the mysteries, but since Seeing a Large Cat the thriller and danger aspects of the mysteries (along with the melodrama!) has taken over.  This novel is certainly no different.  As the plot description states, Ramses, along with David and the entire family, is drawn into political intrigue involving the Egyptian Nationalist movement and WWI spies.  This plotline is certainly interesting and leads to the culmination of several books worth of hints and plotting, but it just grows old after awhile, especially with the near Superman-like heroics of Ramses. Also, Nefret is once again an annoyance.  An interesting development in this book was the emotional interaction between Amelia and Ramses.  While we've always known there was love and great respect (along with a tad bit of annoyance) between mother and son, it has never been shown in the manner this book allows to develop.  It was about time, too!  All that being said, I'm still willing to give this book four stars (more accurately 3.5 stars) because Peters has once again drawn me into the lives of this over-the-top family and their unbelievable adventures.  She gets points for finally developing the relationship between Amelia and Ramses and for an ending that knocks your socks off and explains so much.  Maybe next time we can actually do a little archaeology.	2005-03-28

Starting with The Cardinal Sins on through The Priestly Sins I have thoroughly enjoyed Father Greeley's wit, his unapologetic view of the Catholic Church, and his continued love of that same church.  There was a time when I stopped reading Father Greeley's books because they became to schmaltzy for my tastes, but The Priestly Sins is a return to the early Father Greeley.  In this novel he takes on the abuse scandals that have plagued the Church in the last few years.  While Father Greeley does not hold back in speaking out against the scandals, the abusive priests, and the Church hierarchy, neither is this a hatchet job.  Father Greeley has some definate opinions on the failure of some in the Church to confront this issue and nip it in the beginning instead of allowing it to continue, to damage the lives of so many young people who trusted their Church.  But moreover, Father Greeley still has an obvious love for his faith and its ability to heal, to forgive, and to bring joy into people's lives.  Like Herman Hoffman in the novel, I'm sure Father Greeley will not endear himself to some Catholics, especially in the hierarchy of the Church, but then Father Greeley has never seemed to care about that, and he has done more to bring a human face, a humanizing quality to the men and women to who serve in the Church than anyone else.  As someone who is not Catholic I may be able to look at this differently, but I truly believe this is one of the best novels Father Greeley has every written.	2005-03-23

As with the last few books in this series the violence directed at the Emerson family becomes more dangerous than it ever has been. People are being shot, prostitutes are murdered, and members of the Emerson clan are put in extreme, dangerous positions. What the author seems to be doing is showing what a family living in and working in Egypt might have to deal withat this point in history: Egyptian nationalistic movements, British prejudices, and the rumblings of WWI (minus the mystery high-jixs and Master Criminals, of course). The one annoying factor in this novel was Nefret. The author has chosen to take a once strong and intelligent young woman and turn her into a petty, childish, lovelorn twit who not only makes bad choices that put the family in greater danger, but also breaks the heart of nearly every member of the family. Ramses also had his annoying moments.  He has always been a favorite character, but since attaining adulthood he's become a brooding, self-righteous, and insulting young man with a real \\"superman\\" syndrome. Again, I'm allowing myself to become too invested in the lives of fictional characters, but that's the hallmark of a great author. One of the bright spots and little used aspects of this novel is David and his new wife Lia. Much of this novel revolves around accusations against David and his late grandfather, Abdullah, so I wish he could have played a larger role, but he does become a major focal point of the novel near the end. I just wish the author would allow this character to step into the limelight more instead of being little more than Ramses' shadow. Overall, this was an exciting and thrilling edition of the Emerson clan adventures and I strongly recommend the novel.	2005-03-22

Moreover, what the heck happened to Nefret's strong character and will?  This time she acted more like a spoiled simpering child that the strong woman we've come to enjoy.  I enjoyed the return to the Lost Oasis featured in the previous novel, The Last Camel Died at Noon.  What I did not enjoy was the soap opera quality plot between Nefret and Ramses and Daria, but that's only a minor annoyance.  As usual, the Emersons have gotten themselves embroiled in a dangerous plot that puts the lives of everyone at stake.  Once again, we are treated to the return of Amelia's favorite nemsis and to even more outrageous experiences by the nearly invincible family.  With each progressing novel in this series, Peters seems to be ratcheting up the violence and danger the family must endure.  The last time they visited the Lost Oasis they nearly died in the desert, this time they are involved in a plot to take over the Oasis that was quite thrilling at times.  The are some downsides to this novel:  the Daria issue and the laughable ending with Nefret in the cave.  Overall, however, this was a fun read.	2005-03-21

For the most part, I did; however, what really annoyed me was the fact that I had to drag myself more than half way through the book before it finally started to get interesting.  Yes, I enjoy Celtic lore, legend, and history, but the major portion of this book reads more like a graduate seminar than a novel.  Moreover, the character of Lewis really got on my nerves in the beginning.  For someone who was pursuing an advanced degree in Celtic studies he seemed to know very little about Celtic history.  These two faults aside, once this book gets going, it really gets going.  The last half of the book is non-stop and riveting.  By the end, I was fully invested in the characters and the plot.  The religous underpinning of the novel, like the novels of C.S. Lewis, was not over the top and moves the novel beyond just another average fantasy novel, which opens it to an audience that might not otherwise read fantasy. I look forward to the next two books in the series.	2005-03-21

First the story:  it was intersting to say the least.  This time around there is much more of a dangerous and violent tone to the novel and the ending, sad and heart-wrenching, came out of nowhere.  However, it lacked much of the fun and wonder of previous novels.  Once again, the Emersons are stuck with boring tombs while others get the opportunity the make new discoveries, but I guess the author does have to stick with acknowledged history.  After all, there were no Emersons discovering these great tombs.   What left me cold this time around was the family dynamic, usually a major positive for me.  Nearly everyone in the family takes a disrespectful and condescending tone with Amelia,  the children seemed to have turned into disrespectful adults (especially Nefret), and the soap opera quality melodrama became grating far too often.  Yes, I know these are fictional characters, but I'm 10 books into this series so forgive me if I've become a little invested in them.  Most galling of all was the attitude of cold-hearted disrespect and condescension directed by Ramses towards his mother.  This development, which has only worsened since the last book, has been an unwelcome.  At times, the character seems to take pleasure in showing up his mother, and even more astonishing is the complete lack of respect shown by him towards his father.  Nefret is even worse.  Her willingness to act underhandedly, hatefully, and in a manipulative manner with a family who took her in when she had no one was also a disappointing chacter development.  On a brighter note, it was great to have Walter and Evelyn back in Egypt with the rest of the Emersons, and Lia (providing she matures a bit more) may turn out to be great new addition to the adventures.  Again, I'm allowing these characters to become too much a part of me, but then that's the hallmark of a great story and autor.  I'll let it go now and move on to the next book.	2005-03-13

Back is the fun dialogue, the satiric eye-wink of a mystery, and wonderful banter between Emerson and Amelia.  With this book, Peters has pushed the children into their middle to late teens, which provides for new an interesting voices to combat the bombastic Emerson and the lovingly know-it-all Amelia.  The addition of David, the only good thing to come out of The Hippopotamus Pool, provides a refreshing new voice to the series and loving foil to Ramses and Nefret.  Also new to this book is the addition of Manuscript H, which provides a fictionalized voice to the adventures of Ramses, Nefret, and David.  While I liked the addition of a new voice that allows for a perspective different from Amelia Peabody's, I found the way Peters chose to insert them into the novel annoying.  I would rather have had her break the Manuscript H sections into seperate chapters, but she's the writer, not me.  Overall, this was a nice return to the Amelia Peabody mysteries of old, but with new voices, new characters, the return of old favorites, and a much more dramtic turn than we've seen before.	2005-03-05

The characters of Nora Gavin, Cormac Maguire, and Garret Devaney are exceptionally well-written, but all of the characters are interesting and deserving of our attention. The two main mystery plots were less interesting and tied up too neatly at the end. I mean, who didn't know who the real killers were the moment the author introduced them? But, as I say, it was not necessarily the mystery aspect that drew me. Hats off to Erin Hart for creating such real, non-sterotypical Irish people for her first novel. I look forward to reading the further stories of Nora and Cormac.	2005-03-02

I understand that David is trying to show us the personal lives of these characters as they deal with the loss of their ship and their captain, but was it so necessary to stoop to the level of a Harlequin romance?  This entire book, once you removed the un-necessary Danielle Steel plots, could have comprised of four, maybe five, chapters of real material.  The whole Selar/Burgoyne issue bordered on the absurd.  The only redeeming quality of that plot was the introduction of Selar \\"interesting\\" brother and the appearance of the classic Trek character.  The Robin/Morgan plotline was useless until the last chapter and the classic Trek character that appears in their story is badly written and poorly used.  I look forward to finishing this trilogy.  Maybe then, we can return to some real writing.	2005-03-02

Yes, I understand that Peter David is using the destruction of Excalibur as a way to delve into the inner thoughts and private lives of the former Excalibur crew, but unfortunately it just doesn't work.  Soleta's story is moderately interesting, but after awhile it just got tedious.  As for the McHenry and Kebron story, not worth the effort and often found myself skimming through for the interesting spots.  One of the things that has made this series so enjoyable is the interaction between the crew.  The way in which the different personalities clashed and worked out how to get along in a crunch. Of course, I'm going to continue on.  I've invested too much time to give up now and I want to know what happenes to everyone.	2005-02-28

What an amazing story; in fact, it's several stories in one.  A story of the friendship between Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay.  A story of the \\"golden age\\" of comics.  A story of the Holocaust. A story, briefly, of the Joe McCarthy 1950s when Batman and Robin were accused of promoting a gay agenda (sounds familiar, doesn't it, in a Spongebob Squarepants way?).  There is so much packed into this wonderful novel that at times it's almost too much to take. I've never been a great fan of Michael Chabon, but Kavalier & Clay is so much fun, so interesting, such a nice little trip through not entirely factual history that I just couldn't put it down.  If I had to make one complaint it's that the ending just seemed to fall flat; tied itself up a little too quickly and easily.  However, that doesn't detract from the overall novel.  I whole heartedly recommend this novel.	2005-02-20

The premise certainly sounded interesting. A dash of The DaVinci Code and a bit of The Eight, but this book doesn't come close to being as good as those it's compared to. I found the main charcter to be over the top and predictable, her storyline not even interesting. The flashbacks to Christopher Marlowe and Elizabethan England had the potential to be interesting, but just fall flat. I couldn't even force myself to finish this boring novel.	2005-02-11

I'm now four books into this series and I have enjoyed every one of them so far. Weber gives us a little bit of everything in this series: what life would be like in a royal navy, political shenanigans (although Weber seems to have a dislike for politicians of every stripe), war, and a heroine like none other. Honor Harrington is as tough as any man, but also as feminine as any woman is capable of being such a situation. I've never been a great fan of hard core military SF, but Weber's writing is so exciting, so detail that it just draws you and won't let go until the very last page -- and even then you're chomping at the bit for more. There's a lot to draw you in with this series -- great writing, exciting adventure, political intrigue -- but it is Honor Harrington who's at the center of every novel and the character that hooks you from the very beginning and refuses to let go. Harrington is a rarity in military SF. A fully-realized heroine who can kick (...) and take names without blinking an eye, a woman who takes pride in duty and honor, a woman who doesn't suffer fools well, and a woman who stands up for those unable to stand up for themselves. She is the epitome of an officer and a gentleman (woman). My hat goes off to David Weber for not only creating one of most interesting and exciting science fiction universes to come along in a very long time, but also for creating one of the best science fiction heroines ever!	2005-02-06

Never a fan of Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, I thought I might give this a try since it \\"re-invigorates a number of tried-and-true mystery conventions,\\" was \\"gripping\\" and \\"intricately plotted.\\"  I found this novel to be neither gripping nor intricately plotted; in fact, I found it tedious and quite boring.  The main character of Dr. Jeremy Carrier is neither appealing nor likeable.  He came off has whiny and little self-involved for my taste.  Yeah, yeah, I know he's just been tough a terrible ordeal, but please!	2005-01-31

Don't get me wrong, the plot is definately original and interesting, but it lacks a certain amount of excitement and the characters aren't nearly as well-developed as in DaVinci.  The idea of the Illuminati was intriguing, and much like The DaVinci Code the author has certainly done his homework on the hisotry of the secret society and their supposed current incarnations, but unlike DaVinci the novel reads more like an art history lesson and a poor man's travelogue of Rome.  Moreover, the characters are also a little too stereotypical and over the top. I mean, if the Vatican was in the middle of a possible nuclear nightmare, would the Swiss Guard be that obsessed with the fact that Vittoria Vetra was wearing shorts in the Vatican?  Not being a Catholic, having little understanding of Vatican poltics, and never having actually been to the Vatican maybe so.  There were interesting aspects to the novel:  the aforementioned Illuminati history, the inner workings of the Vaitcan, and the background on CERN.  But when it gets right down to it, Angels and Demons just isn't as good as its more famous follow-up.	2005-01-31

Once I got past the first 50 or so pages, where I usually gave up before, the book had me hooked.  Robert Littell has written an epic story detailing the rise of America's clandestine services, their early successes, and their eventual mis-steps that would lead to the rise of terrorists like Osama bin Laden.  This is a spy novel like no other I've read.  At times I found myself riveted to the page, shocked at some of the plot points.  This turned out to be a great book and I can only kick myself for not reading it sooner.	2005-01-31

When you re-watch \\"Space Seed,\\" Star Trek: First Contact, or even the recent \\"Augments\\" episodes of Enterprise, you get the impression that The Eugenics Wars were this great upheval, but that's not the case in this \\"historical\\" novel of Star Trek's past.  The Eugenics Wars, as the author imagines it, was a shadowy behind-the-scenes conflict that only a select few humans even know about.  That's makes just a bit of a let-down.  I will give the author credit:  he has done an admirable job of weaving real Earth history into the alternate hisotry of Star Trek, but that is also what makes this book disappointing.  The characters remain strong, chief among them Khan, Gary Seven, and Roberta, but they can't raise up an otherwise disappointing story.  Furthermore, as with the previous novel, the whole Kirk/Spock/McCoy sub-plot was a waste of time and totally un-necessary.  I actually found myself skipping those parts in order to get back to the main story.  While I'm glad Mr. Cox -- an otherwise good Star Trek writer -- took the time to fill in this \\"lost\\" piece of Star Trek history I just wish it could have been better.	2005-01-31

For too long, progressive Christians in this nation have allowed the religious right to decide what is or is not a value, what is or is not Christian.  Faith is more than gays and abortions, and that is what Mr. Wallis is trying to say.  While I may not agree with everything Mr. Wallis says I do agree that God is neither Republican nor Democrat, and being a good Christian should mean more than being pro-rich, pro-war, and Republican.  Being a good Christian should mean standing up for the poorest in our nation; it should mean speaking out against racism in all its forms (even when it's targeted against non-Christians and same-sex couples).  This is an important book for those Christians of a more progressive/liberal slant, but also for those Christians who've forgotten what is truly means to following the teachings of Jesus Christ.  For example, a little sermon about the merciful and the peacemakers.  I greatly enjoyed this book and encourage anyone of faith, no matter their political background, to at least give some thought to what Mr. Wallis has to say.	2005-01-31

Reading more like a thriller novel than your classic Trek story, Greg Cox has created a feast of reading pleasure.  Taking all the way back to 1974, Cox gives us the story of Khan Noonien Singh -- quite possibly was the best Trek villian ever created.  Using snippets of the Star Trek chronology created by Gene Roddenberry in the classis Trek episode \\"Space Seed\\" and further in one of the best Trek films, Wrath of Khan, Cox gives us the history of the Eugenics War starting in 1974 and moving forward to story we've heard many times before.  I will say this for Greg Cox, he captures the spirit of the times -- the 1970s through the middle 1980s -- accurately and he brings the character of Khan Noonien Singh to life so well you can almost here Ricardo Montalban speaking the words.  In addition, the characters of Gary Seven, Isis the cat, and Roberta Lincoln are spot on.  Cox has always been a fantastic Trek writer, and his Star Trek: TOS stories are among THE BEST written.  This novel is a must-read for any Trek fan.	2005-01-29

In the past, I've always enjoyed the Star Trek novels because the publishers seem much more willing to take chances.  Chances in the form of relationsips, choices, and actions the television producers seems too scared to attempt.  In addition, the novels always gave the secondary charcters an opporuntiy to shine.  Again, in their focus on two or three main characters (Kirk/Spock/McCoy, Picard/Riker/Data) the supporting cast rarely had the chances to shine except in a few episodes written specifically for them.  Present Tense is an example of the latter.  Here Graf allows the secondary characters to shine and show their stuff, especially Uhura, Chekov and Sulu.  Sulu especially is given more to do than he ever had in the series or movies (except possibly Undiscovered Country and his appearances on Voyager).  The hallmark of the Original Series was the interaction between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  I have to say the author really captures that by-play better than any I've read so far.  As to the plot, there are times when I found myself skimming but the ideas are intriguing and the action is good enough that I definately wanted to keep on reading.  I'm actually reading an omnibus edition published by the Science Fiction Book Club so I won't have to wait long for the end.  If you enjoyed classic Original Series shows, then the Janus Gate series is a must read.  Even if your a Star Trek fan in general, this book series is a great and fun romp.	2005-01-23

The return of Robin Lefler's mother and the intrigue surrounbding her was very interesting.  Morgan seems like she will play an important role in future books.  What I didn't like about this novel was the continued soap opera qualities that other reviewers have alluded to.  ***SPOILER***  First, why would most of the crew turn to a Vulcan for romantic advice?  They mate only when they absolutely have to, and while they are capable of love, is it really the same as that of other humanoids?  I don't think so.  Second, Peter David continues to reduce some of the female members of the crew to starry-eyed, lovelorn teenage girls.  It just doesn't fit with the overall character of the women, especially women in command.  What I really enjoyed was the action-oriented plot.  It was fast-paced and built to an amazing crescendo in the end.  I look forward to reading more novels in the series.	2005-01-17

First, there is the whole high school romance issues involving Dr. Selar, Burgoyne 172, Captain Calhoun, and Commander Shelby. The major disappointment here is the way Peter David chose to write Commander Shelby.  In the two-part episode, Best of Both Worlds, in which Shelby appeared she was a strong, confident woman who was not afraid stand up for what she felt was the correct decision, and in the first four books, David really captured that quality.  In this book, however, she comes off as a jealous, jilted lover and that diminishes her in my eyes. Second, the whole religion sub-plot, while original, just was not very interesting.  Overall, this was an unnecessary addition to the New Frontier series.	2005-01-16

This is the first book I've ever read by Bujold and it makes me want to read her other novels.  The Curse of Chalion features one of the most well-developed plots I've read in a long while.  Reading more like a medieval historical novel with a dash of fantasy -- mostly in the form of a mythological religion -- the novel is a slow burn that keeps building until the finale is finally reached.  Along the way we're treated to exceptionally well-developed characters, an interesting world,  and one of the most original high fantasy novels to come along in some time.  No one who enjoys intelligently written fantasy or historical fiction will be disappointed in The Curse of Chalion.	2005-01-15
US	52364186	R2BAB2BC99X7VY	0449209997	251372077	Callander Square	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Enjoyable Victorian Mystery	I've only lately become a reader of mystery novels, trying to expand my literary universe beyond the usual sci-fi and fantasy I often read, so the mysteries of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt are completely new to me.  I have to say I quite enjoyed this novel and a big part of that enjoyment was the author's style.  To my annoyance, too many mysteries are written in the first person and while that works it doesn't give you the opportunity to better understand the supporting characters when they are away from the detective in question because they would take away from the \\"star\\" of the story.  That's not the case with Callander Square.  When Inspector Pitt leaves the room, the author often lets us listen in on the copnversations of the supporting characters, which allows the reader to better understand their motivation.  Another positive about this novel is its setting: Victorian England.  I don't know what it was about that time period, but it is one that seemed to be weighed down by the under-current of prurient behavior that ran counter to the overt conservativism and the slavish ways in which the elite seemed to hem itself in with their societal rules of behavior.  Anne Perry does an excellent job of immersing us in this society and showing us just how little difference there is between self-important society types and everyday people.  In fact, the mystery of the two dead babies takes second place to the actions of the society types who are looking out for themselves.  A great book.  I look forward to reading more of the series.	2005-01-02

I don't know if it is the author's obvious condescension or the fact that the novels lack any sort of serious plot structure; but then, considering these are above all satires maybe I'm missing the point. My main problem with Lost in a Good Book is that there is only a semblance of a plot; in fact, reading each chapter is like watching a television show -- each chapter is like a stand-alone episode. It's not until the last 75 to 100 pages that any semblance of a plot begins to appear -- like the final story arc of television series heading towards its season finale. I will admit that Fforde continues to amaze with this alternate England he's created and I continue to enjoy his ability to use supporting characters from various novels like Alice in Wonderland and Great Expectations -- and keeping them in \\"character\\" all the while, while his creation of Jurisfiction is probably one of the most interesting of the novel. That being said, the fact that little no real action or plot development occurs until that 100 pages was a major disappointment for me, but it won't stop me from reading the next book in the series. I mean, how many times have we been disappointed in one book in a series? Lost in a Good Book is not a great book, but it is worth reading just so you can move on to the next book.	2004-12-31

In creating the New Frontier series, David breathes new life into a stale series that has been tied to the vision of Gene Roddenberry or the producers of the television shows.  Not the case here.  David mixes old and new characters to create an exciting story that is both original and true to Gene Roddenberry's vision.  Among the new characters introduced Captain Calhoun is probably the best captain to sit a starship since Captain Kirk.  He has many of Kirk's qualities, but also the leadership skills of Picard and Sisko.  Peter David surrounds Calhoun with some old ST:TNG characters and new faces like Bourgoyne-172, a Hermat (hermaphrodite).  Burgoyne-172 is the kind of charactes the TV producers would have been too scared to tackle.  Overall, this book is a great new addition to the Star Trek universe.	2004-12-28

Keyes has proven to be an excellent world builder and story-teller.  Picking up where The Briar King left off, The Charnel Prince allows us to delve deeper into the kingdom of Crotheny and its surrounding empires.  As with the first novel, Keyes' character development is spot-on -- the best thing about these novels IMHO -- with Anne Dare the best heroine we've seen in fantasy for several years (at least since the last \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" novel), and she continues to grow and learn her place in the grand scheme of the story.  Anne, by far, grows and matures more than any character in the novel.  Sir Neil MeqVren, the Queen's most trusted night, is also a fantastic creation and obviously has an important role to play in the future plot.  Keyes' villains are also great, especially the religious figures which seek to supplant secular rule with a fanatical religious rule -- even if that means unleashing unspeakable horrors onto the world they claim to protect.  I cannot recommend this novel more; if you waiting for the next George R. R. Martin novel, this is a worthy substitute.  The character development is top-notch, the world-building first-rate, and the character development fantastic.  I've never been a great fan of Keyes' previous novels, but he has a new convert - at least until this series is completed.	2004-12-28

First, it was damn boring and not until half-way through did it even get exciting or interesting.  Second, Grianne Ohmsford, the whole reason for the story to begin with, is nothing more than a guest star in this book.  The events that happen in the Forbidding, or Jarka Ruus, are by far the most interesting points of the plot, yet Brooks spends very little time there.  Maybe he waiting for the final book in this trilogy, but most of what happens in this book seemed unnecessary and just filler. These failings certainly won't stop me from reading the next book, but I wish Brooks could have done a better job.	2004-12-12

R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series.  While I would not consider in that category, I did enjoy this novel quite a bit.  The characters are fully-formed; the world they inhabit fully-realized; and the premise interesting and worthy of continuing the series.  Not being a fan of Keyes' alternate history Age of Unreason series, I was hesitant at first and actually kept the book on my shelf for the better part of a year before picking it up.  That was my mistake.  From the first page I was hooked on the premise and was nearly a hundred pages in before I looked up to see what time it was.  That's saying a lot.  Much of the so-called \\"epic fantasy\\" out these days is far from epic and short on character development.  That's not the case here.  Each of the main characters in this story can carry their own weight and many of supporting players, as well; in fact, you really start to bond with each one of them and very quickly become invested in their well-being.  Too often in fantasy these days, character development takes a back seat to flashy magic and the oft- and over-used dragon.  Not the case here.  Keyes brings enough originality to the fantasy setting that you want the story to continue.  How long has it been when you could say the same thing about Jordan or Brooks?  Again, this is not quite Martin, but it is a good second and a great book to read while you wait for A Feast for Crows.	2004-12-12

Two chapters in particular stood out for me:  Chapter 4:  A Country-by-Country Approach and Chapter 5: Partnering with the Islamic World.  Chapters 4 lays out in detail the conditions in five nations (Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan and Iraq) in which terrorists, or as the authors call them \\"jihadists,\\" are seeking to replace existing governments or have already succeeded in installing a fundamentalist regime.  Of particular importance, I think, is the discussion of Pakistan (a nuclear country) and the failed policy in Iraq. Chapter 5 discusses how we can partner with Islamic countries to promote ideas like democracy, civil liberties, nonviolence, and protection of noncombatants.  This is a dry volume, but that doesn't reduce its importance.  Every library in America should have a copy of this book.	2004-11-28

At its heart, Chances is a story of the relationship (or lack thereof) between a father and his daughter; not to mention the repercussions of their life choices.  This book is also a great historical novel that begins in 1913 takes us through prohibition, the founding of Vegas, through 1979.  In between there is love and loss, children born, loved ones killed and a rollicking good time.  Of all Collins' novels, Chances remains her best example of character development and well-developed plotting.  The story hooks you from page one and charcters are the kind that actually make you root for them to succeed.  Collins has written several sequels to this novel featuring Lucky Santangelo, but with the exception of the eponymous Lucky, none of them compare to this first novel.	2004-11-27

This was the first Jackie Collins novel I ever read; in fact, I came across it at my local library by accident. From the very first page I was hooked, and to be honest I loved all the sex, drugs, and Hollywood shenanigans. Collins really blew the lid off of what it was like to be a \\"Hollywood wife\\": affairs, drugs, plastic surgery, pregnancies, glitz, glamor, and a hell of a lotta fun. Normally, I don't give a Collins novel more than three stars, but this one was just too good to rate below four stars. If you're looking for great escapism and a peek into what Hollywood was, still is, like then Hollywood Wives is a must read. The mini-series based on the novel wasn't too bad, either.	2004-11-27

If you can let yourself go and not concentrate too much on the less than good writing style you should enjoy this novel.  The main problem with the novel is that the characters are a little wooden and a rehash of former, better written, characters from previous novels.  That being said, if you like Hollywood sizzle and escapist fiction (and I do), then this novel, like many of Collins' novels, is a fun read.  If there is one thing Collins can do it's give us an insiders view of Hollywood.  While what she writes may seem far-fetched, all you have to do is watch Entertainment Tonight or E! to see that she's not too far off from the truth.  As to character development, Collins does a good enough job with Lara Ivory and Joey Lorenzo that you want everything to work out for them; !!SPOILER!! and with all Jackie Collins novels, it does work out with the help of some improbable events.  It's obvious that I liked this novel, so you might be wondering why I would give it only three stars.  Well, Collins may be a fun novelist to read, but she can never be confused with a \\"great novelists,\\" but that's OK.  I don't read Collins for great fiction, I read it for fun, and fun only gets three stars in my book.	2004-11-27

While, yes, there is that age-old fantasy plot of magic and dragons, Weis manages to create enough originality from these old stand-bys to make the story worth reading.  In addition, the characters are all very well-developed and engender much interest.  Chief among is Draconas and Melisande.  The plot itself is also interesting enough to keep your attention through the last page. Overall, Weis manages to wring enough originality from this genre to make Mistress of Dragons well worth reading and its sequels worth checking out.	2004-11-24

Even the usual witty repartee between Amelia and Emerson wasn't enough to salvage this book for me.  The whole plot seems pointless with Amelia and Emerson just meandering around Egypt's various famous archaeological sites.  As much as I hate to admit it, I really missed Ramses, and that whole England bit was far too boring.  Let's hope the next book redeems the series for me.	2004-11-22

One of the great things about this series is that it was a refreshing combination of the mystery-horror-fantasy genres with intriguing characters, interesting plots, and the fact that it was based in my home state of Missouri made the books that much more interesting.  This book, much like Cerulean Sins, just does not live up the standard of the previous novels.  Where Anita used to kick ass, she now spends more time on her back servicing the sexual needs of the many \\"men\\" in her life.  Jean-Claude has become little more than a foppish secondary character; and Richard has been pathetic for several books now.  As much as I love a good series, there comes a time when an author needs to give thought to ending it.  If all Ms. Hamilton can do is place Anita one soft-core porn scene after another (not to mention a completely unnecessary and totally stupid discussion about Richard's equipment), maybe it's time to move on.  If you still like the series, wait for the paperback because this book just isn't worth the $20.	2004-11-11

While King's writing ability has certainly approved with age, he still suffers from meandering plots and the enraging ability to prattle on about a whole lot of nothing.  That being said, Dark Tower 7 is by far one of the best books in this series, certainly better than the last two, but not quite as good as books 1-3.  There was a real emotional under-current throughout this entire book.  It's almost as if King himself has used this series to exorcise some major demons in his own life.  At times, I had to put this book down and rest simply because of the emotional impact of events in the story.  I don't know what King has planned post-Roland, but I'm not sure it can ever live up to these books -- his magnum opus. Say thankya, big big.	2004-11-07

In this book, we get a look into the past hisotry of Deanna Troi and Wil Riker, their love affair, and their eventual reunion on Enterprise-D.  Majel Barrett's Lwaxana Troi was a favorite of mine on the series and I always looked forward to her appearances.  She and Marina Sirtis really seemed to play well together and acted so much like a real-life mother and daughter.  Peter David really captures Majel's Barrett's Lwaxana in this story.  She's brash, opinionated, rude, and downright funny. This is one of the few Star Trek novels I've read more than once and I enjoy it every time.	2004-11-01

This is my second favorite ST:TNG novel and I always wished they'd made a movie or a multi-part story arc when the show was still in syndication.  How interesting it would have been to see the TNG actors portray such opposites of their normal characters, most especially Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).  This novel returns us to the Dark Mirror Universe featured in one of the better Original Series episodes (\\"Mirror, Mirror\\"), this time with TNG charcters.  Diane Duane, author of the great Spock's World, treats us to a rolicking good time.  Deanna Troi uses her telepathic skills as a form of torture, Dr. Crusher is a vindictive kept woman, and Worf is the noble hero.  A great read!  This would have been a much better way to end the movie series than with the lame \\"Nemesis.\\"	2004-11-01

Some of his books I've really enjoyed (The Song of Albion series), others not so much (The Celtic Crusades).  This book falls into the \\"not so much\\" category.  The characters are bland, cardboard cut-outs of previous incarnations; the motivation behind many of the characters is thin at best; and the writing seems like it was called in.  If you're a Lawhead fanatic, you'll love this book.  If you're a fan of Arthurian legends, there are better choices out there.	2004-10-25

Before picking it up I knew absolutely nothing about the story of Cuchulain, the legendary Hound of Ulster.  I found myself enthralled by the story, the characters, the myth, and the setting of this novel from page one.  This was the second of Ms. Llywelyn's novels that I'd read -- Lion of Ireland being the first -- and I think it's ranks as one of her best.  By the end of the novel, even though you know that it cannot end well, you've become invested in the characters and it's sad when it finally ends.  The novel has a lot to say about love and war, what motivates men (and women), and a curious historical tie-in to the modern troubles of Ireland.  A great read for anyone interested in ancient Ireland's legendary past.	2004-10-25

Llywelyn recounts in detail the journey of Donal Cam O'Sullivan and a rag-tag group of survivors as they move across Ireland to the safety of the north and Hugh O'Neill.  Over a thousand men, women, and children set out on this journey and through treachery and death only 34 make it to the north.  Above all this is a story of courage and patriotism.  How a small group, encouraged by a strong leader, refuses to subject themselves to an invading and unwanted monarch out to rein in control of her stolen lands.  This book is very much pro-Irish, so take that into consideration, but the author has history and a long bibliography to back her up.	2004-10-25

The novel mixes elements of history and science fiction with some chess thrown in for fun.  In many ways, the novel is a throwback to B-movie thrillers, but the author has a way of making you forget that with interesting historical background and a different take on the \\"immortality\\" genre.  My only complaint is that the ending seems rushed and falls flat.  If you liked The DaVinci Code, then The Eight is right up your alley.  This would make a fantastic movie for a strong actress and I've often wondered why no one has ever picked it up.  Unfortunately, the author has never written anything up to this par since.	2004-10-21

Terrorism is by far the greatest threat to our nation, to the world, in the 21st century.  More discourse, even from those who have a differing opinion, is needed.

The novel is a mixture of several genres:  science fiction, fantasy, mystery, horror, and old fashioned literary fiction.  One of the great things about this novel, at least for me, was the alternate universe created by Fforde.  In it the Crimean War is still going on.  In our world, the Crimean War was a poorly managed lucky win for the British and their French allies and lasted only 2 years.  In addition, the idea that literature would play such an important part in everyday life is a nice bit of wishful thinking.  Fforde also throws in a lot of humor; one of my favorites is the Rocky Horror type rendition of Richard III, in which audience members participate with the actors.  The novel has its flaws, but overall it's a worthy read and I look forward to reading the further adventures of Thursday Next.	2004-10-11

The great thing about this graphic novel is that is does a great job of bringing a visual aspect to Martin's written words.

Sure, they don't compare with Frank Herberet's masterpiece, but then I never expected them to. On their own, the first two novels were good \\"Star Wars\\"-style space opera; however, this book was just not as good. It was almost as if the authors wanted to get the series done and over with so they could move on to other ideas. I think it also lacks in continuity between the other novels. The first two books featured the same characters and followed within several years of the Jihad timeline. This book jumps ahead several decades and introduces and entirely new cast of characters, with the exception of Vorien Atreides who survives because he received life extending treatments from his father. Near the end, the book seems rushed and falls flat. What started out as an OK continuation of the Dune saga fell flat with this novel.	2004-09-19

In addition, it gives us an opportunity to make sure it never happens again, at least make it as difficult as possible.  This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue, it's an AMERICAN issue.

What kept me going was the character of Vanyel and the characters that surround him.  At first, Vanyel's whole spoiled, put-upon princely heir attitude got on my nerves, but once the character is freed from the confines of a constricting parental relationship, he really begins to shine.  The other drawback was the relationship between Vanyel and Tylendel.  After awhile it became too cloying and sickly sweet for my tastes, and the author's use of the brutish father to drive Vanyel into the arms of another man seemed too sterotypical. As a work of fantasy, the author does present a somewhat original world with different ideas about magic and that's a saving grace for what, at times, was more like a fantasy soap opera. It was however, good enough for me to be interested in the next book in the series.	2004-09-19

It's very interesting to see the reviews of people who lean to the right of the political spectrum.  They groan and moan about what a hatchet job this is, but saw no problem with literally hundreds of books written about the Clintons, which cherry-picked information and didn't come close to the number of corroborated sources of Ms. Kelley.

The authors expanded on universes already created and I was introduced for the first time to series like \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" and \\"Alvin Maker.\\"  I don't know if it was the crop of stories this time or the fact very little of it was an expansion of their respective universes.  The two best novellas were \\"The Sworn Sword\\" from George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series and \\"Lord John and the Succubus\\" from an offshoot of Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series.  While no fan of Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series, I've grown to like her Lord John Grey character, which falls more into the mystery genre in other stories.  Of course, Martin is great.  I would love to see him expand the two stories featuring Dunk and Egg into a full-blown novel such as Jordan did with \\"New Spring,\\" but AFTER he finishes the main series.  The other stories were mediocre at best.  I didn't enjoy the stories of Card, Silverberg, and Feist as much this time around; thought McCaffrey's and Brooks' contributions were a waste of time (maybe these series has been done to death?); and I was never much of a fan of the other authors.  For me the two stories mentioned above were worth the price, and if you're a fan of the other authors it will be for you, as well.	2004-09-12

I believe that every American should take it upon themselves to learn about their constitution instead of listening to what the talking  heads and politicians tell them what it says.

The only reason I picked it up was due to being part of a reading group discussing the novel.  H. G. Wells should be considered one of the founding fathers of science fiction. His science fiction is thought-provoking and grounded in reality -- no grandiose space opera here.  If you're looking for Star Wars or cuddly ETs, this is not the book for you.  But if you're looking for intelligent science fiction that spends more time on characters and less on theatrics, read War of the Worlds.

I have to say, the Dark Tower series has to be the best books Stephen King has ever written -- yes, even better than The Stand.  Song of Susannah takes up right where The Wolves of the Calla left off.  This time our heroes are separated as they frantically search for the pregnant Susannah.  At times, the suspense was nerve-wracking.  Most intriguing was the addition of an alternate universe Stephen King, and not a very sympathetic version.  The author has mostly likely reached into his own past to paint a picture of a previous incarnation of the himself, one we would problably not like.  It's almost like Stephen King is trying to atone for past mistakes as he goes writing off into the sunset.  The best part of the entire book, at least for me, was the journal at the very end.  That alone was worth the price of the book.  I eagerly anticipate the final book in the series!	2004-08-29

While the Saga of the Seven Suns is certainly not great science fiction, it is really good sci-fi with characters you grow to care for.  The first two books were OK, but this one really ratchets up the suspense as the war with the Hydrogues continues.  This time however, betrayals and political intrigue take on epic proportions: humanity is at war with humanity; civil war is brewing inside the Ildiran worlds.  But we also have a greater understanding of the various alien entities: the Hydrogues, the Faeoros, Verdani (World Trees), and the interesting Wentals.  Anderson has certainly created some original characters.  My greatest complaint with this series has always been the drawn-out story.  There are too many characters and the story could certainly use some better editing.  That being said, Anderson has my attention and I look forward to the next book.	2004-08-28

It had some definite potential, but the authors, with their usual short, choppy chapters, don't allow themselves the time to develop character and plot. There are several character aspects that deserved expansion: Jool Noret and the Mercenaries of Ginaz, Erasmus and his \\"child,\\" and the character of Selim Wormrider, which had definite moments of greatness, could have been a volume unto itself. This is the main problem with the whole book. There is a lot of material with great potential, but the authors don't take the time to develop it.    To their credit, Herbert and Anderson did a good job with characters such as Serena Butler, Iblis Ginjo, Norma Cenva, Xavier Harkonnen, and Vorian Atriedes. They each have brief opportunities to shine, most of them changing drastically both mentally and physically between the first and last pages. There just wasn't enough of that. However, I have to say there were moments of great joy and sadness that really grabbed my attention.    Again, this is not Dune, but give the novel a chance on its own merit. Taken as the grand space opera it's meant to be, it's not a bad novel.	2004-05-10

Taken on its own, this book does have its problems. The characters try to be three dimensional, but fail for the most part (Vor is really the only one that comes close). The plot is far too jumbled and choppy, but then that's a characteristic of the Kevin J. Anderson writing style. All that being said, this is a pretty good book with exciting space battles, interesting ideas and a look at how Frank Herbert's Universe came into being. Is this how Frank Herbert would have written the story? No. But on its own merits, Dune: The Buterlian Jihad is alright. If you need a Dune fix, this should suffice.	2004-05-04

Some reviewers felt it was hatchet job, but all Brian Herbert is doing is presenting an honest picture of his father.  No, he was not perfect, not a great father, and a little strange; but then, that's how he was.  If you're looking for some insight into how Frank Herbert struggled and slaved to create the Dune universe, this the perfect book to read.  It shows us how long Frank struggled until he finally came upon the idea for his greatest novel; moreover, it shows the great love he had for his wife, his muse Beverly, and how much he truly loved his children, even though he wasn't always capable of showing it.  The major negative for me was that it was so &quot;Brian-centric,&quot; but then it was more about Brian's relationship with his father and how they got past their early problems and developed a close personal and professional relationship. This book is an excellent ode by a son to his father, and especially to his mother.	2004-05-03

Let me just say, this is one of the most engrossing, exciting novels I've read in a long, long, long time!  It's not just the fact that it's a thriller -- some of the thriller aspects are little hard to believe -- it's all the history and speculation we get to be a part of.  From the very first page, the author draws you into secret sects, religous history, and ancient secrets involving Leonardo Da Vinci.  Everything from speculation about Mary Magdalene to the Divine Proportion, this book has something for everyone.  Christians, in particular Catholics, may find some of the speculation difficult to take, but as a practising Christian I was intrigued by everything.  I may not buy all of it, but it sure makes for great reading.  Don't be stupid like me -- get this book now!	2004-04-02

Being a fan of Shakespeare's \\"Richard III,\\" I was intrigued by the author's assertion that Richard was not the much-maligned hunchback who killed his nephews. I ended up paying 25 cents for a well-worn book with no cover, and it was the best investment I ever made in a book! The action and story catch you from page one, and the plot moves at a great pace with only a few minor bogged down areas. By the end of the book, I was a convert. I fully believed the author's assertions that Richard's history was maligned by successors who were trying to cement their control in England. I've purchased a new copy since and have passed it on to several friends. BUY BUY BUY!	2004-03-29

Ms. Llywelyn is certanly a good writer, and from what I researched concerning the &quot;real&quot; Brian Boru she sticks to the history.

Ms. McCullough's research is impeccable and the plot moves along at a furious speed. The characters themselves are great, forcing you to invest time into understanding what motivates them. The 2 main characters of Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius are so well-crafted that one feels an immediate bond with them. Of all the books in this series, the first two are the best. As the author inevitably moves on to the great Ceasar, the books get bogged down. However, I would recommend all of them to anyone interested in good historical fiction and the history of Rome.	2004-03-29

I've been engulfing The Wheel of Time Series since discovering it by accident several years ago, yet the last two novels have been major disappointments.  That being said, New Spring was like a breath of fresh air.  The novel takes us back to the early days of Moiraine Damodred and Siuan Sanche when they were just Accepted, not full Aes Sedai.  In addition, we get a better understanding of Lan Mandragoran's past and how he became warder to Moiraine.  Take this novel for what it is; that is, a peak at the past of very important charcters and what has motivated them to set in motion the return of the Dragon Reborn.	2004-03-17

The story take place in post-Civil War Boston/Cambridge and someone is killing well-known residents using Dante's Inferno as inspiration -- very original. Boyd Gaines does a relatively good job narrating the story, giving distinct Bostonian accents to each of the characters; although, one did sound too much like Thurston Howell, III. Even with the original concept and excellent historical characters, this reading suffered from a choppy abridgement. At times it seemed like the story jumped entire chapters. If you love a good, original, historically researched mystery, then The Dante Club is a good choice, even with the bad abridgement.	2004-02-29

However, it's just not as good as previous novels, with Drawing of the Three and The Waste Lands being the best so far.  As a fan of King's 'Salem's Lot -- one of his best early books -- I was intrigued by the addition of Father Callahan, but I found myself wishing the man would shut up as he relayed his own story following the events of the Lot.  I especially grew tired and annoyed with the speach patterns of the Calla-folk, \\"say thank ya.\\"  The ending is most interesting and I look forward to seeing what King pulls out of that magic hat of his in the last two books.  The negative point to this book is an old one as concerns King's ability to write on and on and really give you nothing new in way of plot, but I've got too much invested in these characters so I'm certainly not going to stop now.	2004-02-29

The story takes place in 18th-century London featuring a character from the author's Outlander series. Lord John Grey is a good enough character, someone I could enjoy reading about again, but the author's style is just a little too choppy -- not giving us enough time to become really invested in the character.  On an interesting note, the character of Lord John is a homosexual so we get a nice look at that lifestyle in 1750s England. The author has certainly done her research and all the characters ring true from that standpoint, but straight authors writing gay characters just doesn't work -- at least not for Gabaldon.  The book is short and everything ties up nicely in the end.  If the author can do a better job of developing the character and future plots, it will be worth reading more of Lord John's exploits.	2004-02-29

Reading the editors' reviews of the book on Amazon, they compare it glowingly to Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but I just don't see it. Granted this is only the first book, and I will likely read the second, but it certainly was not the caliber of Tolkien. The book is rather choppy and written in a sort of third person narrative that gets annoying after time. I also felt the plot and writing were rather immature. This was one of Le Guin's early works, but it still needed a good editor. I can see, however, why The SciFi Channel has opted to make it into a mini-series, the story is simple high fantasy -- nothing too difficult, nothing too mind boggling. It will probably do well.	2004-01-21

Never having been a great fan of Follett's work, Pillars of the Earth being an exception, I actually found myself getting into the story.  By no means is this great literature, but if you accept it for the excapist fun that it is, you can really get into the story of women spies during World War II.  I really liked the character of Flick; although, at times she could be a little over the top.  Some of Follett's historical accuracy was questionable, but this is &quot;fiction,&quot; so I didn't worry about it too much.  As for the narrator, Kate Reading is excellent.  I've listened to several books narrated by Ms. Reading, Anne Rice's Pandora being one of the better, and she never disappoints.  This bit of escapist fun is great listening for workouts.	2004-01-13

Never being a great fan of the Gunslinger (although the revised edition is somewhat better), I picked up this book with some trepidation -- and I'm glad I did! King was really in top form with this book. The characters are well-developed and the story is interesting. By the time you get done, you can't wait for the next book in the series. Of all the characters, Odetta/Susannah, the Lady of Shadows, is the most interesting and the most haunting.  Long after the book is finished, it's her character that remains with you.  The Dark Tower is one of those series that leaves you anxiously waiting for the next one to appear, which is why it's so frustrating when King was taking his sweet time writing each book in the series. It will also be sad once it finally comes to an end, unlike Jordan's &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series.	2004-01-03

The characters are much better developed than the previous series and the action sustained pretty much from page one.  This certainly isn't great fantasy on the level of early Jordan, George R. R.

My only complaint against the book would be the rehash of plots and devices from previous books.  I understand that Ms. Rowling has a seven book series in mind, but maybe some new plot devices would be in order.  That being said, this book is a must-read for any Harry Potter fan.  The thing about this book is that it's beginning to move out of the realm of children's books into the young adult world.  The characters are of course growing up and dealing with all the problems of teenagers their age, but the action is also becoming more adult as Lord Voldemort becomes ever braver in his attempts to take over the wizard world.  One of the great things about this book is the back history of the story, which allows some character's actions to be better understood.  In addition, a few of the characters make a serious turn in development as they accept the inevitability of events, that they must change in order to survive and be on the side of righteousness.  Like Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix features the death of a beloved character that is totally unexpected and will bring a tear to the eye of any avid reader, so parents should once again be cautioned.	2003-12-13

I first discovered this book by accident one day in my local used book store, and boy am I glad I did!  If you pick up these books and think your going to read a poor-man's Buffy, then think again.  While there is certainly a similarity, especially with kick-ass heroines, there is also a major difference.  In Anita's world, vampires and other creatures of the night are known to exist in the real world, and live along side human beings.  Anita Blake is a tough, gritty heroine who doesn't take crap anyone, either living or dead. This book also introduces us to the best vampire since Lestat, Jean-Claude.  There were many times I found myself chuckling at his flirtatious behavior with a vampire hunter who would gladly stake him.   One of the great things about this book is that it is based in a St. Louis that I know well (without the vampires, of course), and that adds a sense of reality to this lush, vampire fantasy.  Anyone looking for sophisticated, action-oriented, vampire fiction should read this book.	2003-12-13

This time around, Anita goes head to head with a voodoo priestess and the suspense is damn good.  The best part of this book is the developing relationship between Anita and Jean-Claude.  Vampires are not a big part of this book, which is more like a supernatural mystery than a horror novel, but that allows the author to build upon the relationship between these polar opposites.  Laurell K. Hamilton has created a fantastic heroine in which one can become extremely invested.  By the time you get to the end, you both surprised and clamoring for the next one.	2003-12-13

Anita finds herself sucked into a power struggle between alpha werewolves and on the run from a vampire who wants to kill her out of jealousy for Jean-Claude.  Life is never easy, or quiet, in Anita's world.  The book juggles several plot points, but Ms. Hamilton handles deftly -- her writing style and technique continues to improve.

Unfortunately, some Ozark Fairies and a vampire killer make that job more difficult.  The author also gives us the opportunity to see the relationship between Anita and Jean-Claude grow stronger without the werewolf Richard on hand to cause trouble.  This book also introduces us to Master Vampire, Seraphina, who is one of the most evil introduced to date, and the battle between Seraphina, Anita, and Jean-Claude is one of the best.	2003-12-13

It is thick and full of an excitement and, at times, terrifying story that will keep any read on the edge of his or her seat.  I for one could not put this book down and engulfed the story over a weekend of non-stop reading.  The themes of this book have changed as the characters have changed.  Stories involving greater danger, young love, jealousy, and teen angst become more prevalent as the characters age.  Parents should be cautioned, however, to read the book first before allowing their children to hear or read it themselves.  Some of the action will be upsetting to young readers.  Overall, however, this is an excellent addition to the series.  It leaves me waiting with bated breath for the next novel.	2003-12-13

I was not a major fan of this first book.  I thought the writing was mediocre at best and the story line too choppy.  What makes this book so good, and one you want -- need -- to finish is the character development.  Almost from the beginning you're on Harry's side and wishing he could get away from his mean aunt and uncle, and when it finally happens and he's walking down Diagon Alley looking for \\"school\\" supplies with Hagrid...well, you're hooked.  This series of book is, of course, geared towards young people, but they are much more than your average children's novel.

In this one, Amelia and Emerson finally get the chance to dig at the Black Pyramid in Dahshoor -- and you know how Amelia loves those pyramids.  This book brings backs the great characters of old and adds some very interesting new characters.  &quot;Nemo&quot; was an especially interesting character (at least until we find out about his situation) and Ramses is as precocious a troublemaker as ever.  This books ratchets up the tension between the Peabody Emerson and the Master Criminal, or M.C. for the sake of Emerson's bruised ego.  These stories are written with fun and excitement in mind, and if you can accept the tongue-in-cheek nature of the plots, then you'll able to sit back and enjoy a rollicking ride.	2003-12-08

The mystery here is interesting enough, but Amelia and Emerson belong in the hot sands of Egypt, not foggy, damp London.  The book shines a light on the character of O'Connell, a wily, Irish (if not a bit stereotypical) newspaperman and introduces us to the newspaperwoman Miss Minton.  Both are great characters that drive the plot.  There is also the introduction of a woman from Emerson's past, which creates an interesting subplot of jealousy for Amelia.  Also introduced in this book are Amelia's nephew and niece: Percy and &quot;dear&quot; Violet.  Both are necessary, but extremely obnoxious, characters that bedevil Ramses and reduce him in the eyes of his parents.  This whole storyline is the main reason I've lowered my rating to 4 stars.  Amelia's treatment of her only son borders on abuse and it just spoils an otherwise good book.  Don't let that stop you from reading The Deeds of the Disturber, though.  The mystery is good, and different, and you'll find yourself well invested in the plot and characters - even the annoying characters.	2003-12-08

I have to admit, I've fallen in love with Amelia Peabody Emerson!  This first book in the series had me laughing out loud at the outlandish behavior of our intrepid archaeologist.  Ms. Peterson, who is quite knowledgeable concerning Egyptian history and artifacts, doesn't play dumb with the history or facts.  The plot may be somewhat light and possibly written tongue-in-cheek, but you can resist becoming invested in these characters. When I first picked up this book at a yard sale, I was expecting something along the lines of The Mummy, but what I got instead was a rollicking good time, a fact-based Egyptian mystery, and character that actually brought a chuckle to my lips as I was furiously reading.  And if you liked movies like The Mummy or The Mummy Returns, this should fit the bill, as well.  After you've finished this book, I dare you not to run out and get the next one (or two, or three).	2003-12-07

I'd known about for years, but after seeing the dreadful Kathleen Turner movie version, I decided to skip the books.  Stupid me!  I've only read this first book, but I have to say I'm hooked.  The character of V.I. Warshawski is probably one of the best female P.I. characters out there.  Sara Paretsky has written strong, three dimensional female that you can easily become attached to.  The plot of this first book was a little choppy, but the author's understanding of Chicago -- the lay of the land, the police, the politics -- makes up for any shortcomings.  Bravo job!

In it, the Peabody Emersons are once again headed to Egypt for the digging season.  This time, however, they (and we) also get to me their son, called Ramses, as he also joins them.  The mystery of this one is the usual mix of Egyptology, dastardly deeds, romance, and the indomitable Amelia.  The addition of the talkative, often times know-it-all, adventurous Ramses is great; however, the ability of this child to know as much, if not more, than his parents is it hard to believe at time, but this is after all fiction. As usual, Ms. Peters leaves us with a better understanding of the beauty that is Egyptian history -- the woman knows her stuff.  The great thing about this book is that there were times when I was actually on the edge of my seat, furiously reading the pages in order to find out what happened next.  All in all, a great read and a lot of fun.	2003-12-07

Ms. Rice has certainly done her homework when it comes to ancient Rome and Antioch -- it's like she had a time machine and went back to learn the most minute of details.  My only regret with the book is that we didn't learn more of what happened to Pandora after she left Marius, got rid of her mean, Eastern vampire lover, and before the events of Queen of the Damned.  She deserved a book the size of The Vampie Armand and Blood &amp; Gold.  Ms. Rice's Vampire Chronicles are pretty much hit and miss since The Tale of the Body Thief, but Pandora shines as an example of Ms. Rice's great storytelling talents.	2003-11-30

As a lover of history, I greatly enjoyed Ms. Rice's descriptions of ancient Rome, Constantinople, Florence, and Venice.  The only negative I can say about that detail, and the reason I give only 4 stars, is that she can ramble on for pages about this stuff ad nauseum!  You can always tell when Ms. Rice has fallen in love with the material she researches, and her descriptions of Botticelli are an example of that.<br />Anyone who enjoys the Vampire Chronicles should enjoy this book.  It introduces some new and intriguing characters like the brooding Avicus and the powerful Eudoxia. We also learn a little more about what happened to Mael and how he became a vampire before hooking up with Maharet. The book does rehash some of the material from Pandora and the Vampire Armand, but that doesn't detract from the overall positives.	2003-11-30

The Sword of Shannara is good, but you can see where the author has developed into a better writer with this set of books.  The characters are much more three dimensional, the magic is new and unusual, and the plotting is exceptional.  Brooks is sometimes accused of being the Stephen Spielberg/George Lucas of the fantasy world, and he's certainly no Robert Jordan or Tolkien, but the books are good on their own merits.  I feel like Brooks reached the pinnacle of the Shannara series with this set.  The books that follow - The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara - don't come close to being this good.  This set of four books in one hardbound edition is definitely worth the price.	2003-11-30
US	52364186	R2N1A6Q3PJNZJQ	0399149724	619984812	The Confessor	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A Great Thriller	This book certainly lives up to its genre.  The story is as fresh as current headlines concerning Jewish and Catholic relations and what happened during the Holocaust.  Author Silva has written a timely novel and one that delves deeper into the psyche of his main character art restorer and secret Israeli angent, Gabriel Allon.  Silva does an excellent job of creating three dimensional characters that become easy to root for.  My only negative about the book is the pace of plotting. Mr. Silva moves it along so quickly that at times it becomes choppy and a little over the top.  That does not detract from an overall good effort.	2003-11-30

The Sword of Shannara Trilogy along with First King of Shannara is a great series of books and Brooks does a great job of taking the usual fantasy ideas and giving them a few news twists along the way.  The Heritage of Shannara is better, but you have to read this trilogy first (and First King of Shannara).	2003-11-30

Conason does a great job of debunking the &quot;lies&quot; of the right and how they've distorted just about everything they write or say about the left.  Conservatives paint themselves as the heroes of the downtrodden, the saviors of the country, and chosen of God.  Well, if their's one thing Conason does is show that load crap for what it is, and unlike the Coulters of the world, he doesn't pull a few bits and scraps from a Lexis-Nexis search then try to create a distortion around it.  It's just the facts, ma'am.  This is a great companion to Franken's Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.	2003-11-30

The characters are one dimensional at best, the story badly plotted, and there is very little about the \\"voyage\\" that makes one want to invest time and energy into the story.  If you're a die-hard Shannara fan, then buy and read them; otherwise, check them out from your local library.	2003-11-30

I find myself waiting with bated breath for each new book in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  It's to Martin's credit that he can create such great characters and plotting that we can't wait to see what happens next.  The books themselves are not what I'd call &quot;fantasy&quot; in the truest sense.  There are certainly fantastical elements, but these stories read more like historical fiction with the some magic thrown in. This book is the best so far.  The story throws a few curve balls and characters we've grown to care about are forever changed.  Bravo, Mr. Martin! I eagerly await the next book in the series.	2003-11-29

The characters are flat and the story boring.  Like Blackwood Farm, Rice pulls from both the Vampire and Mayfair Chronicles, but it just doesn't work.  Great characters like Lestat, Rowan Mayfair, Michael Curry, and the pugnacious Mona are weak, crazed, and/or boring.  By the time I finished this &quot;novel,&quot; I felt nothing for the characters.  They neither grew nor moved forward.  Lestat's obsession with Rowan Mayfair seems forced, the Taltos story is a major letdown, and the ending just sucked.  If this is truly the end of the Vampire Chronicles and the Lives of Mayfair Witches, we (and the characters) got screwed.<br />I have been a fan of Ms. Rice since first discovering Interview with a Vampire and have devoured her novels since.  Some have not always been satisfying (Memnoch being a good example), but I've always come back for more.  Now, I'm not so sure.  If she chooses to write something different, it will have to be damn good for me to lay down $25 for it.	2003-11-29

Once I did, I was hooked.  This series of books, Game of Thrones being the first, is exceptional!  Once I got through the first few chapters, I found myself completely invested in the characters and their stories.  Martin's greatest achievement with this series of books is the characters -- they are three dimensional and highly developed, which is a rarity in fantasy fiction these days.  Some have compared Martin to Robert Jordon and I think that's a good assessment.  Martin shows the kind of character development and plot control of early Jordon books (pre Path of Daggers).  Unlike Jordon, I can only hope he's able to maintain this control.  I also hope that Martin can wrap this series up before it becomes too convoluted like the Wheel of Time series.	2003-11-29

A Forest of Stars takes up 5 years after the events of Hidden Empire with the war against the hydrogues going badly.  Anderson does a better job of developing the characters than he did with the previous novel, but the format of devoting each chapter to a different voice becomes annoying at times because it creates a situation in which the story must jump from person to person at a hectic paste.  That being said, it does not detract from the overall story, which builds to a suspenseful level as main characters die, new ones appear, and we learn more about the ancient gas-giant aliens.  For me, the Theroc race of humans who live in the huge, telepathic Worldforest is by far the most interesting with their sentient trees and green priests.  As I rushed through the ending chapters, I found myself riveted to a story in which I had become much invested.<br />I've always been a fan of great space opera and Anderson does not fail to satisfy.  The original aliens and human races make up for the choppy writing style.  Anyone looking for escapist action, adventure, and romance will be more than satisfied.	2003-11-29

If you're looking for Sci-Fi Channel, &quot;star wars&quot; style sci-fi then this book is for you.  The first and last 50 or so pages are quite good, it's just plodding through the convoluted middle that makes the book difficult to read.	2003-09-27

First and foremost, the artwork of this book is fantastic -- some of the best I've ever seen in a comic book!  This is true of nearly all the CrossGen Entertainment series.  You might be tempted to thnk this series in &quot;Xena&quot; meets &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; and while it has some of those elements, it is so much more.

The problem is that there is too much bias on either side.  Journalists today no longer have the integrity and objectivity to effectively report the news.

The world need less of the liberal-hating rhetoric Mr. D'Souza spews forth and more answers to fixing the real problems within our great country. To think that America is perfect, with no problems, is a dangerous attitude, and criticizing those problems is not un-American.

It was definately the darkest of the Shannara novels, more so than &quot;The Druid of Shannara.&quot;  I thought &quot;Ilse Witch&quot; was great, but this book dragged on a bit too much for me, and the ending was a let-down; however, I am looking forward to the final book. It looks as if some of the ideas I've had about the &quot;Great War&quot; and the &quot;Old World&quot; since the &quot;Sword of Shannara&quot; may turn out to be on the mark.  I would say that after this book, Mr. Brooks should turn his considerable talents to new worlds and ideas.  Shannara may be reaching its limits.	2001-11-17

The Lion of Ireland is the first book I ever read concerning Irish history, beginning a life-long study.

I ended paying 25 cents for a well-worn book with no cover, and it was the best investment I ever made in a book!  The action and story catch you from page one, and the plot moves at a great pace with only a few minor bogged down areas.  By the end of the book, I was a convert.  I fully believed the author's assertions that Richard's history was maligned by successors who were trying to cement their control in England.  I've purchased a new copy since and have passed it on to several friends.  BUY BUY BUY!	2001-11-11

This series of books has been the best reading experience I've had since Michener.  Ms. McCullough's research is impeccable and the plot moves along at a furious speed.  The characters themselves are great, forcing you to invest time into understanding what motivates them.  The 2 main characters of Gaius Marius and Lucius Cornelius are so well-crafted that one feels an immediate bond with them.  Of all the books in this series, the first two are the best.  As the author inevitably moves on to the great Ceasar, the books get bogged down.  However, I would recommend all of them to anyone interested in good historical fiction and the history of Rome.	2001-11-11
