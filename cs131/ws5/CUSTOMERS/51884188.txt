The other is, of course, by Lance Rips.  As the editorial review says, it is very readable, yet it pulls out the main questions about human thought and gives lucid descriptions of and arguments for J-L's side of the question.  It is far from conclusive, however.  One might hope that by reading both sides of the debate, a definite answer might present itself.  The experiments that have been done were done differently, of course with differing results, by those involved with the debates.  Because the experiments were designed to find specific results, depending on the prejudice of the experimenter, the experiments found what the researchers were looking for.  This has not solved any problems, but it has lead to an interesting set of publications for everyone working on this.  The way this research was designed is an unfortunate consequence of the way academia works--publication is more important than answering questions or trying to find a way to get objective results.  Designing and carrying out experiments that aren't designed to show a certain result is still an option, if humanly possible.	2002-08-16

Sure, she can put together a good sentence that, considered apart from its content, is a pleasure to read (hence its one star), but the content ruins whatever else one might have hoped for from a book on a Christian view of women.  <br />Elliot's view boils down to the idea that women should appreciate being women simply because that's what they are (big revelation--very, very few people are confused about whether or not they are women), not because of any perks or blessings that come with the job.  She claims that women should enjoy their men for being men, with all that that entails--including, but not limited strictly to, barbarism.  Yes, women are told to love their men for (or in spite of) leaving dirty socks on the floor, forgetting to shower after working out, drinking straight out of the carton, urinating on the toilet seat, etc.  Yes, having a penis is plenty of excuse, according to Elliot, for behaving badly/stupidly/unsanitarily.  And women are supposed to love them for this and feel guilty for wishing that men could clean up after themselves and behave decently.<br />Please.  I'll grant that Scripture teaches that wives are supposed to submit to their husbands, but it's preposterous to expect anyone to want to, much less love to, be around or be married to the kind of lout Elliot puts forth as being truly masculine.  And it's not biblical to behave like that.  The OT laws prescribe moral and sanitary codes that would, if noticed (which doesn't often happen in these days of 21st century Christianity), preclude most of the behaviors that women find most annoying.  At least if you hire repair guys rather than marrying somebody you think will handle the repairs, the hired help take their butt cracks and go home; you don't have to live with them.<br />_...	2002-08-16

His experiments were more thorough and better organized, but they fall to the same critique I gave J-L: they were designed to get the results they got.  I preferred Rips' side of things even before reading the book, which is why I think it may not be possible to design better experiments--I've yet to meet anyone familiar with the debate who didn't already, before familiarizing himself with the debate, have an entrenched opinion on the matter.  But this is no reason not to read up on the subject.  This is a central book in the cognitive sciences, is very well done, and makes for exciting, mind-stimulating reading.  But there is plenty of work to be done on the topic, and neither J-L nor Rips have done it.  Given human nature, such may not be possible.	2002-08-16

If one wants to catch up with the debate, this book is not the place to start.  It's a fine book, but it's not central.  A more efficient place to start would be with J-L's _Human and Machine Thinking_.  J-L has published more books on the subject than has Rips, but that just means that some of J-L's books aren't really critical to understanding the debate.  This is one of those.  In it, he makes a lot of the same claims found in his _Human and Machine Thinking_, but the topic is not so focused as in HMT.  For a comparison of the statistics and main arguments of the two views, get HMT and the book by Rips, which I have also reviewed.<br />However, if one wants to be thorough about one's research and would like to compare subtle changes in the way J-L's side of the debate has been expressed over the years, as well as seeing more material that may be interesting to follow up, definitely get this book.  J-L and Wason have written a fascinating volume.  I even recommend it for reading on rainy Sunday afternoons.	2002-08-16

Unfortunately, this book doesn't really contribute anything to the discussion of the role of women; Robbins argues against  those Christians who are trying to make radical feminism acceptable in the  church.  Well and good, but it has been done before by many  theologians--anyone familiar with the history of the debate surrounding  women's rights will know that for most of history, church has been a  spectator sport for women, which is what Robbins wants.  I think Scripture  backs him up in regard to his thoughts on women's role in church.  However,  Robbins goes beyond that and wants to apply church principles to society,  arguing that women should have no say whatsoever in political realities.   God Himself doesn't go that far.  Robbins abandons his standard of sola  scriptura on this point and appeals to &quot;nature&quot;, statistics, and  tradition to support his point; none of those can work.  Scripture in fact  allows women to hold political office (it wasn't common, but neither is  altruism--rarety doesn't make something wrong), to own property, to conduct  business, to handle her own financial affairs, etc.  Robbins has handled a  problem that exists only for those to whom Scripture is not the sole  authority for faith and practice; in handling it, he abandoned that  standard himself.<br />Robbins' book gets three stars for being a thorough  critique of the misinterpretations of Scripture that radical feminism has  brought into the church.  His abandonment of sola scriptura in an effort to  make life a spectator sport for women is why this book didn't get five  stars.	2000-06-12

Ever wonder why Britain and Germany outpaced Spain  and Italy as world powers?  Ever wonder why South America languishes in  poverty in spite of tremendous natural and popular resources?  Ever wonder  how Roman Catholicism has justified its long history of brutality and  dictatorship?  Ideas have consequences.  Robbins identifies those ideas and  shows what consequences must and do derive from them.  Any familiarity with  world events and history will allow the reader to see that what Robbins  says makes sense.  Any careful scholar will find Robbins' detailed and  accurate research unimpeachable.<br />Unfortunately, people who are so careful  and so correct have not traditionally been popular with the Roman Catholic  Church, and as tradition is a big part of RCC dogma and practice, I fear  that Dr. Robbins may be in for a rough personal ride.  With Scripture and  logic on his side, Dr. Robbins may be hard-pressed and persecuted, but he  will never be crushed or destroyed.	2000-06-07

Ephesians has generated volumes of commentaries; Clark avoids the temptation to verbosity and distills his thoughts to the essence to end up  with a commentary that is both deeply informative and readable.  He also  provides brief summaries of some of the main ideas from other standard  commentaries on Ephesians.  One's understanding and appreciation of  Ephesians will increase greatly through a reading of this book.<br />Clark  throughout provides his own translation of the Greek text; this new way of  wording the text offers a refreshing way of looking at the text.  It is  unfortunate, however, that Clark seems to struggle inordinately with any  word or syntactic pattern in the Greek that doesn't seem to have a precise  one-to-one correspondence in English.  Translation is never an easy matter,  and it's not always clear where to draw the line between translation and  paraphrase; Clark's problem seems to be that he assumes that there is  indeed a clear delineation between the two, and his accounts of his mental  hiccoughing through the struggle of translation provide an unfortunate  tangent to a look strictly at the text.  Clark would have done better to  provide a brief discussion of the issues involved in translation in an  introduction to the book and limited the main body of the book to his  explication of Scripture.  Even so, this is a minor distraction and one  more likely to annoy a linguist than a casual reader.	2000-06-07

Robbins killed it.  As would any responsible philosopher, Robbins began with epistemology.  When epistemology fails, the entire system fails, and  Robbins demonstrated the complete failure of Objectivist epistemology.   Robbins really needn't have written anything past that, but he did--largely  because objectivism is not a systematic whole that coheres logically  together among its parts.  He also demonstrated the failure of the parts.   If there remains any confusion about what Objectivism teaches or what the  logical and responsible response should be, this book will clear it up.	2000-06-07

The selections are short enough to be read in those few spare  moments between tooth-brushing and falling asleep but long enough to  provide an adequate picture of the thoughts and styles of the authors.   Fuller did not aim at exhaustiveness; the reader who wants more information  will need to look elsewhere.  This book is a good spring-board.  Based on  the introductory notes for each author, one would easily be able to look up  other works by the author and historical and biographical information about  the author.<br />I would comment on two downsides to this book.  First, the  selections are not always taken from the most authoritative or readable  translations (where translation is relevant).  For some of the authors,  certain editions have become quoted widely and in many contexts; the reader  might recognize the places where one of the famous quotations originated,  but it's unlikely that the famous quotations will be present verbatim in  this book.  If the reader doesn't recognize the place or the quote, the  reader might be at a loss to be able to trace (from this source) this  influence of a writer's specific words throughout other times and  places.<br />Second, the biographical and historical notes that introduce each  author are rife with cliches and attempts at eloquence that more often end  up being circuitous than eloquent.  I prefer that people get from point A  to point B with a minimum of what Cicero calls &quot;purple passages&quot;,  but that does not seem to have been the goal of the writer.<br />As a  beginning resource or quick reference to digestable selections, this book  is great.  As a guide to writing and translation, this book could have been  better.	2000-06-07

Unfortunately, that's where this book's only star is gained.  Alston tends to chase himself around, over, and through his  topics, leaving the reader with no line of thought that can be consistently  followed.  He fails to connect his theology to his philosophy of language.   His philosophy of language fails to agree with or elucidate either common  sense notions of language or linguistic findings, and his theology is  nothing remarkable.

Strum rejoices in this discovery and  thrills to what this says about the supposed evolution of humanity.  It  says nothing good.  Humans still prey on one another and don't even have  the sense of efficiency in survival that baboons have; baboons at least  gain some nourishment from their bloodthirsty exploits.	1999-07-08

Clark asserts that the image of God is what distinguishes man from the rest of creation and that said image consists in  man's rationality.  Beyond the obvious critique that the severely mentally  retarded must have less of the image of God than must other, more  intelligent persons and therefore must not be as worthwhile as other  humans, Clark fails to account for, or even comment on the existence of,  competing views, leaving the casual reader with a philosophical position  that will make him wish to become a rigid ascetic, seeing as how his body  does not carry the image of God and is therefore about as important as your  average gnat.  This, of course, also fails to allow for the legitimacy of  the study of medicine, a development I certainly would prefer to avoid.  On  the plus side, Clark has a concise style that doesn't waste the readers'  time, and he has wit and humor that keep even the driest of subjects from  becoming monotonous.	1999-06-16

As a linguist, I was disappointed with how it began its introduction to the Hittite language.  The authors gave a decent intro. to grammar, but not to the mechanics of  the cuneiform.  All of the conjugations and declensions were  transliterations, leaving the student with no way to deal with actual  Hittite texts.  Further, many of the linguistic tidbits that the authors  offered amounted to &quot;that's just the way it is.&quot;  Rarely do such  excuses give the only available explanation; in spite of potential evidence  that would avoid such sidestepping, the authors did not comment on more  concrete theories. <br />To limn: this book is okay as a beginning, as the  barest beginning, but you'll have to spend hundreds of dollars on  additional texts and do your own linguistic analyses if you're serious  about learning the language.	1999-02-16
