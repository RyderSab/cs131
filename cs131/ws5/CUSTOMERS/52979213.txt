All share the same geographical sites and (some of) the same stories.<br /><br />However, just as crucial as are the similarities, so to are the differences--both theologically and geographically.  The three religions can not agree on even the simplest fact of which son Abraham sacrificed.  Thus, representatives of all three religions battle metaphorically for history, and concretely for geography.<br /><br />Feiler clearly has problems with the Muslim interpretation--suggesting that it has the least room for tolerance with the other two versions of the story of Abraham (and notes the lack of a central Islamic authority figure who could suggest a revision).  However, having also just read \\"The Trouble with Islam Today\\" (Irshad Manji), there are clearly others who disagree.<br /><br />A powerful (and powerfully written) book, despite its biases and short comings.	2005-09-17

However, Bennett takes this well established fact and goes much, much further.  By adopting the perspective of the slave, he demonstrates that not only didn't Lincoln free anyone, but he in fact succeeded in postponing freedom for hundreds of thousands of slaves.  Prior to the Proclamation, Congress had already enacted the Confiscation Act, which authorized the Army to free the slaves of anyone in rebellion against the United States.  the effect of the Proclamation was to stop the Confiscation Act from being enforced--thus relegating every slave in territory conquered by the Union Armies to additional months of slavery.<br /><br />Further, Bennett makes the compelling case that this was not an inadvertent failing (or a product of necessity) but an intentional strategy by Lincoln.  Tracking Lincoln's history from his earliest years as an Illinois legislator, Bennett successfully argues that Lincoln never wanted Blacks to be able to live on equal terms with Whites.  Even after the civil war was won, lincoln was still against freeing the slaves; trather, he wanted them deported to Central America or Africa.<br /><br />As Bennett notes, had such a mass deportation plan for ethnic minorities been proposed in our century, it would properly have been labelled genocide (think of the Serbian plans to remove all Albanians from Kosovo).  In other words, from the slaves' perspective, Lincoln believed in ethnic cleansing, not emancipation.<br /><br />Finally, Bennett disputes the common response that Lincoln had no choice politically.  First, he cites numerous private statements of Lincoln to demonstrate that he was, at heart, a racist.  Second, he cites the example of many other politicians (e.g., Illinois' own Lymann Trumbull)who took a stand for real equality and emancipation, yet continued to win elections.<br /><br />Whether you agree with Bennett's analysis or not, it provides an extremely interesting antidote to the Lincoln history machine which routinely labels him our greatest president.  As I said at the beginning, one can ask little more of a history book than the ability to make you think about well established history from an entirely different perspective.at he was, at heart, a racist.

Churchill was a card carrying member of the aristocracy; one of the small group of men who ran England up to, and through, World War II.  Their Finest Hour is an amazing documentation of the very height, and at the same time, end, of the all powerful aristocracy in England.<br /><br />Churchill's second volume of his Six Volume history of the Second World War begins with May, 1940, as the German army is rolling through Luxembourg and Belgium (both clinging to their neutrality right up to the minute the German tanks crossed the border), toward a woefully unprepared France (still reliant upon the Maginot Line, which in turn depended on Luxembourg and Belgium neutrality.<br /><br />Churchill has just assumed the post of Prime Minister, after having spent the prior year (and several before that) as an outsider bemoaning the refusal of Britain (and France) to prepare to meet the rising German threat.  Those years of exile are the subject of volume one.<br /><br />The present volume focuses on the extraordinary difficulties Churchill and others in the British government faced once the war actually began.  Once France was forced to surrender, Germany was left in what most of us think of as continental Europe without any enemies.  It had allied itself with fascist Italy, made peace with Stalin, conquered Poland and France, neutralized Spain, and occupied Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands.<br /><br />In this sense, Britain stood alone.  There was a very real risk that Germany could invade and conquer Britain in the Summer and early Fall of 1940.  The German bombing of London was increasingly effective, and the British army was in total disarray, having just been forced to abandon France, leaving most of its equipment behind.  Just how worried Churchill was comes through clearly and terrifyingly in this volume.  Had Germany succeeded, the world might look very different today--the Second World War would have been transformed into a truly intercontinental war, with Asia and Europe allied against North America.<br /><br />Of course, Britain was not really \\"Alone.\\"  Greece and Turkey were firm allies; Bulgaria and Yugoslavia stood against Hitler and Italy; and Britain controlled most of what we today think of as the third world--from Gibraltar at the southern tip of Europe, to Egypt, to South Africa, India, Malaysia and Burma, and Australia.  Only by adopting a firmly eurocentric view of the world (which Churchill clearly had) can he title this volume \\"Alone.\\"<br /><br />Churchill and the rest of his government were able to move seamlessly into power, and immediately take control of this world wide empire precisely because of the peculiarly insular class system that ruled Britain.  Even as an outsider, Churchill clearly had full access to all of the centers of power.  He could not bend and shape them, but he was fully in the loop.  Personal relationships and lifelong associations meant that he regularly met with leaders at all levels of the power structure--including most importantly (but by no means exclusively) top politicians and naval personnel.  This sort of access by \\"losing\\" politicians in the United States today is unimaginable.  Can anyone seriously envision Bush allowing the head of the CIA to meet regularly with Howard Dean to review the intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?<br /><br />The only weakness in this volume is Churchill's over reliance on his own contemporaneous telegrams and memos.  he was absolutely prolific, apparently having dictated dozens of multi-page memos daily--yet still finding time to run the government.  While fascinating historically, they really are bureaucratic memos.  The first volume, by relying more on narration and less on historical documents, allowed Churchill greater reign to his incredible skill with the English language.  Here, long sections read like just what they are--official documents written in haste, for the historical record.<br /><br />That said, his brilliant use of words shines through.  The most stirring passage is toward the end--his eulogy in November, 1940, for Neville Chamberlain, who more than anyone was responsible for \\"appeasing\\" Hitler.  Rather than lapse into \\"I told you so\\", he marshals some of the most stirring words ever written to praise Chamberlain; urging history to judge him on the strength of his character rather than the results of his actions, which are subject to the fickleness of history.<br /><br />In sum, this is a remarkable book, chronicling a remarkable time in history, written by a remarkable man who played a central roll in events.  I can think of no other book by anyone at anytime which brings together all three of these elements--and is well written!English language.

Many are only familiar with this book through the screen adaptation starring Henry Fonda.  While a good movie, the book has so much more. Forget the movie; read the book.<br /><br />Clark sets his book in the old west--immediately post civil war.  He takes a typical western scenario--a rash of cattle rustling in an isolated town cries out for \\"self-help\\" justice by the ranchers who are being driven to bankruptcy.  Clark then turns this well worn premise inside out and uses it as a foundation on which to build a novel which explores what justice means and whether it can ever be implemented outside of established rules and procedures, how one acts justly as part of a group, and the causes of mob violence.<br /><br />Written in the 1940's, the Ox Bow Incident has clear implications for what was then a rash of lynchings across the South (and all too many in what we today think of as the \\"North--Illinois, for example).  Clark brings this issue into the novel by giving a Black character a leading role (and having him speak as one of the voices of reason).<br /><br />Read today, the Ox Bow Incident remains highly relevant.  Clark's powerful examination of the dangers of justice without process applies equally well to current events in Guantanimo and Abu Grahib as it did to lynching in the forties, and frontier justice in the 1880's.<br /><br />This is a book which should be read by anyone interested in gang violence, abuses in the military, national security, lynching, and human nature in general.<br /><br />Books become classics because they have something interesting to say about human beings.  The Ox Bow Incident deserves its nomination as a classic, and should be much more widely read than it is.	2005-04-23

You are guaranteed to break out into laughter over and over.  People will look at you like you are insane.  Of course, a few of them may actually be so intrigued that they will buy the book, and discover Hiaasen for themselves.  They will be enriched if they do.<br /><br />This, the first of Hiaasen's books, contains his usual mix of pro-environment/anti-developer politics, a good \\"who dun it\\", and rollicking laughs.  It is, however, darker, angrier, and more ambiguous than his later books.<br /><br />The supposedly bad guys in this case clearly have a point--Florida is being destroyed by real estate developers.  They have a plan--terrorize the tourists, so they all move back north.  They pull it off with the usual Hiaasen bumbling good humor.<br /><br />How can you go wrong when a minor sub-plot involves an anti-Castro revolutionary group who can't decide if the event they are celebrating happened on July 6 or July 7, so when this argument threatens to destroy the group, they compromise and call themselves the \\"First Weekend in July Movement\\"?<br /><br />However, there are no real heroes here.  The \\"detective\\"--a recently fired newspaper reporter--is the only character who is not tinged with some fatal character flaw--gee, do you think this might be because Hiaasen is a recently retired newspaper reporter, taking up a new career as a writer?  Virtually every other character, from murder victims to police officers, are both good and bad...doing the right things for the wrong reasons, or doing the wrong things for the right reasons.  There are a few throw away characters who do bad things for bad reasons, but they are cartoonish evil, and are just there as foils for the good/bad guys who form the heart of this plot.<br /><br />More recent Hiaasen novels have clear cut heroes (at least within the weirdly constructed worlds of his novels), and clear evil men.  They may be funnier, but I'm not sure the more recent books are better for this lack of complexity.<br /><br />This is a very good introduction to Hiaasen.

Of course he was flawed.  He was dirt poor, uneducated, drank too much, fought too much, and had too little respect for the law.  Yet despite all of these flaws, he lived a moral life--hewing to his own personal code of conduct with strength that we should all envy and emulate.<br /><br />Charlie raised a large family, in the rural south, in the depths of the depression.  He was a roofer.  He ran a still.  His family moved every year or so--sometimes chasing after work, sometimes running from landlords.<br /><br />Yet through it all, he defended his family; refused to tolerate bullies who used violence on those less fortunate; and most importantly, treated his wife and the mother of his many children like another human being.  As Ava says throughout--Charlie had many shortcomings, but he always talked to her.  He never shut her out; he never left her to wither on the sidelines, relegated to raising children alone.<br /><br />The whole point of Bragg's brilliantly written book is that a man who adopts a moral code requiring protection of family, and kindness to strangers--and lives by that code to the best of his ability--can be a hero.  It is not riches, land, or political power which makes heroes.  it is the strength of commitment to a moral life.<br /><br />Charlie was a bone fide hero.  As the book notes in its closing section, we need many more heroes like Charlie today.	2005-04-23

This is not a feel good story of how the justice system ultimately worked to save an innocent man.<br /><br />This is a terrifying story of how an innocent man was found guilty of a horrendous crime, not once, but twice, with full appellate review and decent lawyering at every level. A dozen people swore over and over that they saw him near the crime scene. Several testified that he made incriminating statements. All were dead wrong. He was no where near the crime scene. He never admitted to anything. Someone else killed that little girl--and remained free for a decade (and in fact raped others while Bloodsworth sat in prison).<br /><br />But for the fact that DNA analysis was perfected, Kurt Bloodsworth would still be in prison, serving a life sentence, never to see freedom again, all for a crime he had absolutely no connection with.<br /><br />But for the fact that an attorney filed a routine motion to preserve evidence, evidence which everyone agreed was useless, it would have been destroyed.<br /><br />But for a stubborn defense attorney who decided to retest evidence which everyone had claimed contained no useful fluids--there would have been nothing for to test for DNA.<br /><br />Sure Kurt Bloodsworth is special. All of these facts happened at the same time, at the right time, to enable him to prove he was innocent. But how many others are sitting in prison proclaiming their innocence do not have this \\"luck\\"--it is hard to use the word \\"luck\\" in connection with someone who spent over a decade in prison for a crime he didn't commit, and then another decade trying to prove he was innocent (not just \\"not guilty.\\").<br /><br />Anyone who reads this book will come away with an entirely different view of the criminal justice system, the reliability of eyewitness testimony, and the infallibility of the police.	2005-02-23

After his first albumn of folk songs, he released a series of albums which contain some of the most brilliant writing ever.  Song after song on albumn after albumn have become so infused into our culture that virtually everyone knows not only one or two, but dozens.  His songs became the soundtrack to the youth revolution of the 60's, the Civil Rights movement (or at least part of it), and the anti-war (VietNam) movement.  He was widely held out as the spokesman for a generation.  Every major song writer since (think, Bruce Springstein)has been called the \\"new\\" Dylan.<br /><br />Yet, as is apparent from this book, Dylan really is like the rest of us.  He grew up in small town Minnesota.  Struggled to find his voice, made a crappy deal to get recorded.  Got married, had kids, moved to the suburbs.<br /><br />The tension between these two Dylan's is what comes through in Chronicles.  He recognizes (in a very understated way) how amazing his out put was over the first decade.  He admits to intentionally sabotaging hisimage with the release of Self-Portrait...in an attempt to shed the burdens of fame, stardom, and generational spokesperson (people breaking into his family home to pay homage to the idol would drive anyone to tank their careers.<br /><br />And Dylan also recognizes that he never again has (and probably never will) wirte like he did for the first few years. As he explains in Chronicles, he had a \\"special connection\\", which is so rare, and so direct, that he can not understand it himself.  Connection to what?  Dylan never explains.  God or faith generally?  Maybe, Dylan seems to hint.  Society and its own tensions?  Dylan strongly thinks so--largely based on his combination of living an ordinary life, steeping himself in the classics of fiction, and learning every authentic folk song he could get a hold of.  Some combination of these?  That may be the reason for the power of his songs.<br /><br />To have had that power, and then to not.  Can any of us understand the feeling?

Board of Ed--not honoring it	Read this book.  It makes you think critically, challenge your assumptions, and argue with the author.  What more can you ask of a book?<br /><br />Bell has the honesty to look at Brown from the perspective of its fiftieth anniversary, and ask the question, \\"What did it all mean?\\"  Bell has the standing to ask this question, having devoted much of his life to litigation seeking to enforce the promise of Brown--often at not inconsiderable risk to his own life.  Bell has the intelligence to bring to bear facts coupled with a historical perspective.<br /><br />His conclusion:  Brown was a step in the right direction, but had far more effect as a symbol than as a legal decision.  Factually, virtually no child (Black or White) received an education in an integrated classroom as a result of any court order enforcing Brown.  What little integration occurred (and the number of children (Black and White) who attend effectively segregated schools today--50 years after Brown--is staggering) resulted from legislative action (the civil rights acts of 1964/65 and the school finding acts of the same period).<br /><br />Bell's analysis of Brown as a legal precedent is persuasive.  It is more of a symbol than a living legal precedent.  However, I disagree that Brown's symbolic power should be discounted.  The reason that there have been so few cases citing Brown is that Brown so effectively ended legalized segregation.<br /><br />I would argue that without Brown, the civil rights movement of the late 50's and early 60's (sit ins, voter registration, and other direct action) would not have been possible.  For example, James Meredith survived his attempt to integrate the University of Mississippi by using his personal defiance to leverage the power of the United States government to battle the Klan.  Without Brown, Meredith's struggle simply would have died (perhaps most literally).<br /><br />Behind every successful mass movement was the protection (however ephemeral it may have been in all too many cases) of federal law enforcement.  That presence would not have occurred without the mandate (and symbol) of Brown.<br /><br />As Atlas said, give me a lever and I can move the world.  Brown did not move the world; did not eliminate racism, and did not end segregated schools.  It did, however, provide a fulcrum.  The mass movements and direct actions which followed were the lever.  And the world did, indeed, move.<br /><br />Is racism gone?  No.  Are some people worse off than they were before Brown?  Yes.  Did Brown reach the issues of poverty generally or the impoverishment of Blacks in particular?  No.  Bot so what?  No legal case or series of legal decisions can change a society.

Just because a book involves three daughters and a crazy patriarch, doesn't make it a re-write.<br /><br />What A Thousand Acres is, is a great book.  Smiley uses the setting or a successful, large (for Iowa) farm, middle aged ennui, and the passing of an older generation, to peel away layer after layer of personal history and explore the motives, feelings, and dare I say soul of her narrator, Ginny.<br /><br />Her father, on the surface, is a highly respected, expert farmer, who has built a small plot into the largest, most successful farm around.  All of the neighbors seek and value his advice.  Two of his daughters are \\"successfully married, and they and their husbands live on the farm, and help with the harvest, etc.<br /><br />The fulcrum of the plot is the father's decision to retire, and pass along control of his farm to his three daughters.  While they all resist, he insists, and the deed is done in the first few chapters.<br /><br />What he does not realize is that once his definition of himself as \\"successful farmer\\" is stripped away, there is nothing left--or, rather, nothing good.<br /><br />As the story develops, the fault lines of the family, and of each character are gradually pried apart, until each is fully exposed to the reader--and to him or herself.<br /><br />the fecundity of the farm is contrasted with the barrenness (in Genny's case literal) of the relationships.  None of the marriages are successful.  No character is ultimately satisfied with the life they are living.  No character manages a positive transformation.  And the farm falls apart, and will clearly be sold by the end of the book.<br /><br />In addition to Smiley's superb character development, the characters mirror society as a whole--we put on the values we want the world to see, and those values are often less than skin deep.  Similarly, land which appears to be productive, and the basis for a family's wealth, is ultimately ephemeral, and can disappear the instant we reach self-awareness., and can disappear the instant we reach self-awareness. <br />	2004-12-18

As a lawyer, I know what he means, having thoroughly enjoyed--yet been driven crazy by--this legal thriller.<br /><br />As a mystery, this book kept me engaged from opening line--one of the best ever, by the way--to the Epilogue 60 some chapters later.  Plot twists abound, interesting characters, building tension, and bodies piling up as the story progresses.<br /><br />BUT--these people are all supposed to be lawyers.  The entire plot is driven by every lawyer in the book jumping from one conclusion to another, each with less evidence than the one before.  Lawyers are supposed to be skilled at organizing evidence into a coherent story, and then persuading others of that story's truth.  Theses characters all act on hunches, with no evidence whatsoever.<br /><br />Maybe this would be plausible for our \\"hero\\"--an admittedly brand new lawyer with virtually no criminal experience who jumps into a murder case head first in the deep end.  But Jack--whose opening monologue justifying his false confession to himself opens this book so powerfully--is supposedly a top estates lawyer at one of Philly's very most prestigious firms.  If he practices law based on the paucity of research on which he acts in this book, his clients ought to all get a refund.<br /><br />Anyway, despite spending much of the book (and particularly the second half) yelling at the characters in  my car, I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and will definitely read more of Scottoline (perhaps her more experienced lawyer character, who spends this entire book off stage, understands the use of evidence better than the relatively inexperienced lead character here.	2004-10-02

As the plot unfolds, the number of suspects multiplies--it seems everyone wanted him dead!  We learn about the black market in antiquities, and related tax scams.  Drug money, violence, and multiple murders all make an appearance, as does comic relief, in the form of one of the most inept art thieves ever created--makes Inspector Cluseau look suave in comparison.<br /><br />As usual, her settings are perfectly blended with her characters and plot.  It is great to see a mystery writer showing deep respect for books, libraries, and the librarians who make sure the books are in the libraries (among many other tasks--if you've ever wondered what librarians do, you'll learn through this book).<br /><br />The only problem was with the technology.  For some reason, everyone thought it was perfectly normal for it to take hours on end to copy three computer disks--I had to check the copyright to be sure I wasn't imposing modern standards, but no, its 1999--ever since DOS it only takes a few minutes to copy five floppies.  Obviously, there was something else going on, but none of the characters raised the remotest hint of suspicion.  In fact, the \\"good guy\\" heroine also had to stay up all night to copy just small sections of these very same disks.  Even in the good old DOS days, there was a copy disk command which would have accomplished this function in seconds, not hours!<br /><br />To her credit, Truman does give us an explanation, and it ends up being the key to unlock the solution to the crime(s), but the reader knew it long before anyone in the book.  I found this totally frustrating for the entire last quarter of the book.	2004-09-11

This is not one of them.<br /><br />The basic plot elements are all great.  Ordinary guy falls on hard times, too much alcohol, too much self-pity, too much self-absorbtion.  Then a series of events, rooted in gun running in decades past, mixed with political intrigue, conspire to intrude into hero's neat little self-contained world.<br /><br />The plot twists and turns; no one is quite who we thing he (and, most significantly, she) is.  The story unfolds with Freedman's great writing, and the pages keep turning.<br /><br />Two problems.  First, the scenes between Maureen and Franz feel extremely forced, and even to the point of being long winded.  Second, the story simply peters out at the end.  We don't know if the bad guy gets away with it.  We don't know if true love will out.  We don't even know what happens to the birds.<br /><br />I suspect that Freedman got bored with thrillers, and tried to do something more \\"literary\\".  The title is an excellent double (triple, more?) entendre--it is by viewing his birds that Franz gets sucked in; but it is also by trying to live life from a bird's point of view--above it all, with no cares about the world--that Franz gets sucked deeper and deeper into trouble.  Finally, the whole problem is caused by the fact that Ollie (our hero's whooping crane) is not where he belongs--several thousand miles from Texas, where he \\"belongs\\".  This is also Franz' problem, who got lost in Texas, and ended up a few hundred feet away from Ollie in the Maryland swamps.<br /><br />Good read, but not as good as the other Freedman's I've read.	2004-09-11

Unfortunately, Sanford uses it as an opportunity to introduce a wholly gratuitous race baiting black activist (who I suppose is a cross between Jessie and Johniie Cochran??)  Once he gets that off his chest, the plot settles down into a typical prey book.<br />A criminal drug smuggling conspiracy of nuns, an international ring of chop-shops, and a series of child murder-kidnappings, all come unraveled as Lucas unwinds the lynching.<br />In the midst of all, is Sanford's newest character--Lettie West.  An 11 year old girl, who is also a trapper, who (as Lucas says) has a functioning age of about 42), and is not the least bit afraid to stand up to Lucas' bullying.  Wise cracks abound, love grows.

The terror, hatred, and brutality of the times is searingly captured by the iconic photo which gives the book its title--of a young white student screaming, her face contorted, at an equally young black girl.  Equally appalling is the other major picture which forms the center of this work--a series showing the mob attacking a black reporter, and beating him with no one willing to intervene.<br />While the book would be worthwhile for the pictures alone, it is all the more compelling by bringing the story up to date.  Centered around the fortieth anniversary of desegregation of Little Rock High School, the author tracks down both the black student and the white student spewing hatred.  There are pictures of them together, having gone through a process of healing and reconciliation.<br />The ultimate question--why such hatred--is not answered, nor could it be, given the format and limitations of what is, af4er all, basically a book of narrated pictures.  But the question is certainly raised and explored.<br />This is a great book and should be on the shelf of anyone who loves photography or wants to understand why the Civil rights movement was so important to the history of this country (although I would strongly urge that no one take the advice f the other reviewer, and use this as the primary source for information on this struggle).<br />My only criticism is that the upbeat tone of this volume needs to be questioned.  As James Meridith has said--If a black man can be kicked ten times in open view, and has no redress, is it really &quot;improvement&quot; if he is only kicked nine times, but still has no redress?  Is Little Rock really free of prejudice and discrimination?  Is America?	2004-06-28

More specific battle plans were being drafted at the President's insistence within days of September 11, while we were still heavily engaged in fighting in Afghanistan.<br />What is also clear is that this planning process was grossly distorted by (1) extraordinary ignorance about the realities in Iraq--everyone really seemed to believe we would be welcomed with open arms; we would invade, win, and then everyone would happily return to work; and (2) by incredible in-fighting within the Bush Administration and within the Pentagon.<br />The war between Powell at the State Department and Rumsfeld at the Pentagon has been widely reported.  Woodward highlights the by now well known story of Rumsfeld ordering Powell's people (who had been doing post-invasion planning for a year--out of the Pentagon under armed guard.<br />What has not been well reported is the internal Pentagon conflict.  Remember, by September 11th, Rumsfeld had been at war with the powers that be at the Pentagon for months--his attempts at reform were uniformly resisted by career officers.  The planning for Iraq was so secret that the highest ranking Pentagon officers were not aware of it--including the joint chiefs of staff.  As a result, the invasion plan did not have the detailed vetting usually accorded war plans.  All assumptions went untested, and the invasion was done on a &quot;hope and a prayer&quot;.<br />As Woodward so eloquently proved in Bush At War, unleashing the U.S. military might has a strong downside.  All of that bureaucracy places an important check on the abuse of the incredible power available to the President.  When those checks are removed entirely, nothing stands between the ordinary citizen and military dictatorship, except the good will of the President.  Power should be difficult to wield!<br />What Woodward describes is a six month process of Bush and Rumsfeld systematically stripping away each and every &quot;impediment&quot; to the President's untrammeled use of force, all to the end of allowing an invasion of Iraq without a full debate in the Pentagon, let alone in the Administration, Congress, or the public.<br />This is terrifying to anyone who believes that the military should serve democracy; not the other way around!feld systematically stripping away each and every &quot;impediment&quot; to the President's untrammeled use of force, all to the end of allowing an invasion of Iraq without a full debate in the Pentagon, let alone in the Administration, Congress, or the public.<br />This is terrifying to anyone who believes that the military should serve democracy; not the other way around!	2004-06-27

Mr. Studebaker, owner of the pet store, doesn't know what to do with these &quot;older&quot; rabbits.  Eric--a homeless employee, looking for a friend after having run away from his abusive father--knows just what to do--kill them and freeze them for meat.  How does he know?  Because his father enfenced a 7 acre field, and bred rabbits for hunting.  The rabbit factory.<br />In a series of interlocking stories, Larry Brown artfully weaves together the lives of several characters, all inhabiting (all temporarily) Memphis.  None have had good luck recently, and only Arthur--a former oil tycoon, now 70, in retirement, facing impotency, and trying to hold on to his 40 year old wife--seems to have ever had any.<br />A mobster from Chicago has his privates mangled by a post hole digger; his one legged maid has her leg stolen in her battle with the family poodle; a good looking hooker looses two sugar daddy's, and is then arrested for assaulting an abusive nurse working at an old folk's home; a navy man, whose ship kills a whale, and who then suffers brain damage in an unofficial boxing match; and an ex-con, who really, really tries to go straight, but suffers a series of comic mishaps that turn him into first a murderer, and then food for lions (just in case the Rabbit factory image hasn't sunk in yet).<br />At the end, two of the plot lines remain unresolved.  Will Helen stop drinking and running around and return to Arthur, who (probably) still loves her?  Will the beautiful hooker stay with the brain damaged boxing naval man?  Can anyone ever find happiness?<br />Or are we all, including authors who labor long over a book only to have it read and then discarded, simply grist for some cosmic rabbit factory we call existence.<br />More readable than Waiting for Godot, and far more entertaining--but the point seems the same--there is no point.	2004-06-20

With popular focus on Martin Luther King Thurgood Marshall, and the other &quot;heroes&quot; of the civil rights movement, we tend to ignore the fact that the success of the movement ultimately depended not on these national figures, but on thousands of individuals who decided that freedom was worth laying down their lives and the lives of their children.<br />Winson Hudson was one of those women.  Born in 1916 in the geographic center of Mississippi, she began trying to register to vote in the 1940's, her niece was the one and only Black child who decided to &quot;integrate&quot; the all white school system after Brown, she founded the County chapter of the NAACP, she housed two civil rights workers during Freedom Summer (1964), her uncle was lynched, her sister's house was bombed (several times), and her life was at risk virtually daily for over 20 years.<br />This remarkable book gives a quick summary (the book is less than 150 pages) of these struggles, and provides a window into the heart of Ms. Hudson (and by analogy the thousands of others like her) which gave her the courage and commitment to stand up to oppression and injustice.<br />The book closes with Ms. Hudson's question, and challenge:  where will young people today find this courage and dedication?  Reading about the day to day decisions Ms. Hudson made leads one to examine one's own life.  Is there any cause for which you would be willing to risk being beaten and your house bombed; would you send your 1st grader into the face of a howling mob to prove a principle?  Most would say no.  We need to remember that, but for some very courageous people who said yes to these questions, this country would be a much worse place.	2004-06-02

As Vivien Stern notes in the last chapter of Invisible Punishment, much of Europe looks at us, wondering what in the world we are doing--is the U.S. crazy?  Only 15% of people in France think that a 21 year old repeat burglar should be sent to prison at all.  Here, such a \\"repeat offender would routinely be given a 20 year sentence.<br />Yet that is only the beginning of the story.  In some communities (a detailed essay on Washington D.C. is included) almost one-half of all young men will eventually be incarcerated.  This rate of incarceration destroys the entire social fabric of a community.  Dating relationships are altered(a long-term stable relationship for a woman in such a community becomes an unrealistic dream--there simply are not enough men out of prison to go around!).  The economics of extended families are perverted--when the bread winner is locked up (male or female), older women usually get the kids, and have to support them, as well as bear the considerable costs (mainly telephone calls and visits) of maintaining a relationship between the children and their incarcerated parent.<br />Add to this personal impact, the distorting effect on the macro economy caused by \\"exporting\\" poor black men from the inner city to white, rural areas, with resulting shift in jobs and census based federal money out of the ghetto toward rural areas.  As Tracy Huling discusses, while this shift may be superficially attractive to residents of small town America, in fact experience over the last 15 years has demonstrated time and again that locating a prison in town is not the route to economic salvation, and can often be the beginning of a downward spiral ending in bankruptcy, with the costs imposed by the new prison far outweighing its economic benefits.<br />All in all, Invisible Punishment provides a look at our criminal justice system from a variety of unusual perspectives.  Not just another book that bemoans the hard life of prisoners; instead it focuses on the costs of incarceration to the rest of us.r book that bemoans the hard life of prisoners; instead it focuses on the costs of incarceration to the rest of us.	2004-05-30

Phil Berrigan was a typical product of the depression--family of dirt poor immigrants, went into the army to fight Hitler and do his patriotic duty--but then came home and entered the seminary.  His first posting was to inner City Washington DC, where he encountered racism and poverty up close.  Rather than just put in his time, and then turn his back, serving out his priesthood in a comfortable middle class white community and give an occasional sermon about poverty, Berrigan engaged the poor children he was working with as brothers in Christ, and asked why.<br />His quest for answers continued as he was posted in the deep south (Louisiana) in the late 50's, early 60's...Emmett Till through the Freedom Rides.  He concluded that racism was a violation of Christ's principle that all men are brothers--and said so.<br />Forced out of the deep south, he relocated to Baltimore--still a racially divided city, where Blacks were in poverty.  As the Vietnam War escalated, Berrigan saw that the racism and poverty he experienced daily were inextricably linked to this country's increasing military industrial complex, and its position of world domination/exploitation.<br />As a Christian, Berrigan felt he had no choice but to resist this injustice, demand that the world put aside militarism, and treat all of mankind as brothers in Christ.  He joined civil rights movements, and the anti-war movement--always maintaining that non-violent resistance was not only the right tactic, but was the only course open to a practicing Christian in America.<br />He poured blood on draft files, burned them with napalm, and spent six years in high security prisons as a result.  While imprisoned, the FBI charged him (along with his brother, Daniel Berrigan and his by then wife, Elizabeth McAllister) with plotting to bomb the White House and kidnap Kissinger himself.<br />Berrigan freely admitted to discussions about making a citizens arrest of Kissinger for war crimes, but denied all other charges.  He was ultimately acquitted of all charges.<br />For the rest of his life, Phillip Berrigan resisted the military.  A founder of the Catholic Ploughshares movement, he consistently sought to beat swords (nuclear weapons) into ploughshares.  As he explains at length, he did not expect his actions to cowl the US government into abandoning its nuclear program.  Rather, he was acting on his conscience.<br />Reading his autobiography makes one ashamed of all of the excuses we each make on a daily basis of why we can't act better--too busy, might affect my job, I have kids, and on and on.  Berrigan let none of this stop him.  He married, raised three kids, and spent most of his adult life in prison, on bail awaiting trial, or on parole.<br />His courage is magnificent.  His dedication to living a life of conscience is inspirational.  But above all, Berrigan's version of Christ and Christian duty is one of universal love and respect.  If these principles were lived by everyone, we would live in a far better world than that of Mel Gibson and his glorification of pain and violent sacrifice.<br />Berrigan lived the life (as he put it) of a Catholic attempting to become a Christian.

Books	4	44	48	N	N	Economics and Racism combine to create our broken prisons	Following the over throw of reconstruction, the re-empowered white ruling class in the South needed a large pool of cheap labor.  The Thirteenth Amendment, which outlawed slavery, contained one glaring exception--slavery was still completely legal for those who had been convicted of a crime.  Suddenly, new legislation was enacted which criminalized a wide variety of behaviors not previously considered criminal--having no job, vagrancy, no visible means of support, etc.<br />Once these &quot;Black Codes&quot; were in place, prisons in the South were rapidly filled with Blacks.  Prior to the Civil War, prisoners in the South were overwhelmingly White.  After Reconstruction, they were overwhelmingly Black.<br />These new prisoners were &quot;leased&quot; to White plantation owners, at a flat fee.  With no capital invested in these new slaves, many were simply worked to death.  The economic incentive to ensure that the prisons were full was inescapable.<br />In this short, but powerful, book, Angela Davis makes the case that this pattern of incarcerating Blacks, set during the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, carries through to the present.  Today the economics of incarceration are more subtle.  Money is not primarily made through the labor of prisoners (although that still happens).  Today, the real money is made by the underwriters who sell the bonds to finance prison construction, the myriad of industries which supply the country's 2 million prisoners with everything from soap to light bulbs, and by rural America, where the last three decades of de-industrialization has left prison as one of the very few decent paying union jobs available to formerly blue collar workers.<br />Ms. Davis draws on a plethora of academic studies (several dozen of which are cited in footnotes, which provide anyone interested with a comprehensive study guide for understanding the historical antecedents and current realities of America's love affair with the prison.<br />Her bottom line--abandon the whole flawed system.  The last chapter, which attempts to answer the immediate question posed to anyone who dares raise this option, is the book's weakest.  Too much rhetoric; not enough solid proposals.  Nonetheless, the historical breadth, backed by detailed facts, of Ms. Davis' book make it well worth reading.e--abandon the whole flawed system.

Zinn was with them, and (being a historian, after all) wrote down what he saw.  As Zinn admits, this is not a history.  It is closer akin to contemporaneous journalism.<br />What Zinn does is dramatize just how far from democracy and the rule of law Mississippi was in the early 60's (at least for Black people--but it is hard to believe that this form of autocratic government didn't spill over into the &quot;White&quot; government as well.<br />The Federal Constitution did not apply.  State law did not apply.  A student standing on the steps of the federal building (of all places) is arrested, beaten to unconsciousness, and sent to hard labor at the notorious Parchman Farm.  All for simply watching a line of black citizens attempt to register to vote.  All this while the FBI stands by, and does nothing but take notes.<br />Looking back from the perspective of 40 years on, we tend to glamorize the civil rights movement--the Supreme Court decided Brown, Rosa Parks refused to sit in the back of the bus, King gave a speech about his dream, and then Congress solved the problem by passing the Civil Rights Law.<br />What Zinn makes clear is that while all of this was happening on the national level, the real battle was taking place person by person in the deep south.  The heroes were not limited to Dr. King and Rosa Parks, but included hundreds of yuoung people (the members of SNCC) who turned their backs on middle class educations, and literally put their bodies on the line (and all too often in the hospital) to force the power tructure in the South to recognize the rule of law.<br />The courage and creativity of these young men and women comes through dramatically in Zinn's account--it is inspiring, and terrifying at the same time.  Terrifying just how close to tyranny this country was in the early 60's.  Inspiring to know that young people had the courage, intelligence, determination, and focus needed to battle that tyranny under the most oppressive conditions this country has known since the civil war.  Remember, the horror of Emmit Till was only a few years in the past when these men and women decided to openly challenge the existing power structure.<br />And best of all, they won.

Unlike many animals, chimpanzees can not dominate one another by use of brute force.  No chimp is so strong that a coalition of two other males (or a coalition of females) can not successfully challenge his dominate position.  This means that the dominate (male) chimp can only remain dominate if he succedes in coalition building.<br />Each of the \\"coups\\" DeWaal describes took place either because the dominate male became too greedy, or because another male built a stronger coalition.  Similarly, the dominant make needs the cooperation (or at least neutrality) of most of the (more numerous, but weaker individually) females of the colony.<br />The comparison to human politics is right on the money.  While chimpanzee politics does not have the veneer of ideology that covers the nitty gritty of human politics, I strongly suspect that the type of favors, distribution of goodies, and raw sex that DeWaal describes as the \\"currency\\" of chimpanzee politics is much closer to the way human politicians actually operate than most of us would like to admit.<br />If a Martian were to observe the functioning of the U.S. Sentate--without being able to understand a word anyone says, but with the ability to observe every transaction, day and night, over a period of sereral years, I suspect that the Martian's description of our politics would read very similarly to that of DeWaal's.  Of course, for all we know, chimps too have a \\"language\\" which permits them to cover what appears to us to be raw politics with \\"political platforms\\".<br />One final note--the chimp need for coalitions to maintain primacy has obvious conotations for international relations in our world, where ideology plays less of a role, and coalitions have, at least since the end of WWII, been the key to maintaining a stable heirarchy of nations.

But the lessons Reston draws from Vietnam and Sherman's march are well worth applying to our current occupation of Iraq.	2004-01-11

That's the basic outline we all learn in school<br />Wills takes this history, and re-examines it through the lens of slavery.  The South had slaves; the North didn't.  If we were going to survive as a single country, some compromise had to be worked out.  The South would not join any country that did not protect its right to own slaves.  But there were more people living in the North, and the northern population was growing much faster than the south.  So, what did the South do--demanded that its slaves would be counted in figuring out how many representatives each state got in the House of Representatives.<br />Was this a bargain worth making for the north?  Wills doesn't answer.  Was it wholly immoral--maybe, but lots of people (women, children, those who did not own property) were counted as whole people, yet absolutely denied the vote.<br />Once slavery is factored in, the whole dichotomy usually presented (big states vs. little states) becomes far more complex.  The negotiations were really four cornered--big, little, slave, free all jousting for a political structure which would be most advantageous to their position.<br />Wills applies this same analysis to several other events from the country's first 25 years.  Believe me, this is not the history you learned in school--but it should have been.<br />Why only four stars--the middle third of the book strays away from the slave-free dicotomy, and examines the Jeffersonian embargo.  While fascinating history (who knew that the country was on the verge of armed rebvellion from about 1800 all the way through 1812--and it was largely the NORTH threatening armed resistance to the federal government--then dominated by the south (back to that 3/5 of a vote compromise!).  Massachussets refused to allow its soldiers to serve in teh War of 1812, and threatened to prosecute anyone who tried to enforce the call to arms.  Madison took the threat so seriously, that he simply abandoned all pretense of trying to mobilize soldiers from Mass. during the War of 1812.  As fascinating as all this is--it has little to do with slavery--it really does appear to have been a question of trade vs. agriculture.  Wills' attempt to fit this story in with the rest of his thesis appears a stretch.<br />Wills has written a fine addition to the history of America's early formative years.  Once you understand the forces at work, the compromises made, and the continued pressures which threatened to blow the country apart, you can then make sense of the events that culminated in our Civil War.<br />Was the compromise with slavery worth it?

All too often, people chose the easy way, and conform, figuring the fight simply isn't worth it.  After all, even if you are right, is it really worth losing your friends, your job, your place in the community, andhaving your kids harrassed and ostracized--all to stand up for an abstract principle?<br />Hentoff tells the stories of dozens of people who made that choice--many of whom suffered for it.  As he repeatedly notes, those who wrote our constitution did not take the easy path..they risked all to fight for ASmerica's independence.<br />By giving us examples of those who took the risk, and fought the good fight, Hentoff hopes to inspire others to do the same.  Some of his stories involve the famous (his stories about Justice Douglas are the best in the book--although readers are cautioned that many of the &quot;facts&quot; Hentoff cites are taken from Douglas' own questionable autobiography), and several very ordinary people.<br />I was inspired, and even if you aren't, Hentoff's stories will definitely make you think about the issues.	2003-11-04

If all Hickman had done was give us a portrait of life and growing up in an Appalacian coal mining town in the 50's, this would be a great book. But Hickman uses this setting as the foundation of a much larger story...the race to space, the revolution in America caused by Sputnick, and the opening of small towns accross America to the wider world with the advent of mass communications.<br />Of course, at base, this is a typical coming of age teen story.  During the course of the book, we watch as Hickman grows from a self centered kid into a teen with an accute awareness of the complexity, moral choices, and dangers of the world beyond the borders of his hometown--and of the dangers lurking right at home.<br />But Homer Hickman is no ordinary teen.  He dreams of space. He knows he is destined to build rockets--though he knows absolutely nothing of rocketry, and is failing algebra.  Nonetheless, he perseveres.  Using his own natrual smarts, his ability to talk his parents, other adults, and many of his friends into anything, and using his \\"political\\" connections shrewdly (his father is the mine manager), he overcomes all hurdles--technological and personal--to build a rocket that works.<br />He doesn't stop there.  Once he gets a rocket to fly, he wants to get one into orbit.  It is this quest (reminiscent of so many other quest books form Don Quixote to Moby Dick) that forms the center piece of the narrative, and is the engine for opening his mind to the realities of the world beyond his coal mining town.<br />Needless to say, since he wrote the book, he obviously escaped.  The journey is inspiring.  The writing inspired.  The book is a must read for adults and teens alike.	2003-09-27

As the Prime Minister during the War, he was in a unique position to understand the relationship of those documents to real events. As a central actor, he had a huge incentive to prepare the first draft of history...to place himself in the best possible light. As a conservative politician out of power when he wrote, he sought to warn the world of the looming communist menace. Finally, as a long time practitioner of written English, he had an unparalleled command of the language. In this volume, Churchill successfully blends together all of these personas to create an absolutely riveting history of the prelude to the Second World War--from the close of World War One to the invasion of Belgium.<br />Churchill's mastery of English is reason enough to read this book. For example, in describing the British government's constant debates over what to do about German rearmament, Churchill says the British were &quot;frothing pious platitudes while foeman forge their arms&quot;. Very seldom do I have to turn to a dictionary while reading, but Churchill sent me there regularly.<br />But do not think that this is just a book to be read to enjoy his use of language. His detailed account of how we got into the Second World War, and how we might have avoided it, is incisive and persuasively argued. And always watch for the subtext--his warning that the appeasement on Germany was then (in the 1950's) being repeated in the appeasement of the Soviet Union.<br />Churchill's weakness flows directly from his strength. As a prime actor, he saw (and describes) the war entirely from the &quot;balance of power&quot;, or large political perspective. The plight of the Jews in Germany is barely mentioned. He pays virtually no attention to the internal politics of the U.S.--which ultimately proved decisive in the war. And he virtually ignores the growing war in the far east.<br />With that limitation in mind, this is a book everyone interested in understanding the Second World War--and everyone who enjoys the creative use of the English language--should read.pays virtually no attention to the internal politics of the U.S.--which ultimately proved decisive in the war.

Too bad, because this is a novel that has so much more depth and complexity than is apparent at first glance.<br />The simple story of two boys in their Senior year at a New England Prep school has all the simplistic leasons that we all learned in High School.  But is it really so simple?<br />Take Finny.  Does he really exist?  Doesn't the story work just as well if we view Finney as Gene's alter-ego...that part of him that is pure kid.  A belief he can do anything.  A belief in immortality.  A belief he can say and do anything without consequences.  Note that Gene does not get a name until after Finney falls.  It is only after Finney is broken that Gene becomes a real person--symbolized by being given a name.<br />On a whole other level, given that this was written on the eve of the cold war, A Seperate Peace is an allegory for the awakening of the world.  World War Two was our first fall from innocence.  We as a world community discovered that there really was profound evil in the hearts of some men.  The explosion of the atom bomb completed that transformation.  Not only was there evil, but there was the power to destroy the whole world.  America's growth from self absorbed, isolationist country (Finney) to an actor on the world stage (Gene) parralels Gene's growth in the book.<br />The question is, do we now have Finney back in charge?	2003-09-27

In 1800, a man on a horse could travel 10 miles an hour.  Then, between 1815 and 1850, the steam engine and the train catapulted the average speed to 40 miles an hour, with a maximum speed of 70 miles an hour.  Today, we find such speeds common place.  But at the time, all was a complete mystery to ordinary people.  For example, falling from a moving train was not generally understood to be fatal.  people assumed that falling from a train was much like falling from a horse--it all depended on how you landed.<br />Crichton artfully weaves this type of historical perspective inot a riveting story about the greatest train robbery of all time--which never would have been tried had they understood what they were doing.  But in this case, ignorance was bliss, and it worked, against all odds.<br />Not the Crichton you may be expecting...there is science, but it is the science of the 1800's; no cutting edge technology, unless you consider the invention of wax to make keys new technology--which it was; no exotic locales.<br />Instead, Crichton takes us back to England in the 1850's--at the end of the Crimean War, and less than a decade before the U.S. Civil War, and during the hey day of mass industrialization.  Crichton does an excellent job of setting the stage and reminding us just where the roots of our current urban society lie, and just how recently those roots were first sunk into the rural past.<br />Having set the stage, Crichton weaves the history with a great crime novel.  Taking advantage of wealth, social stratification, and even advanced technology (for the time), Crichton follows a criminal mastermind in his year long plot to steal 12 million pounds sterling, supposed to be used to pay French soldiers fighting Russia in the Crimean war.<br />Trains and safes had both just made their appearances.  Fingerprints, combination locks, and explosives were still on the horizon.  Breaking into a safe on a moving train was a then unthought of crime.<br />Of course, they were caught--Crichton lets us know right at the beginning that his source is the trial transcripts--but the ways, whys, and means are wholly unpredictable, and will keep you turning the pages right to the very end.e horizon.

The Civil War was the first to make universal use of the rifle (compared to the age old musket).  This increased the effective range from about 50 yards to 400 yards, thus eliminating the key defensive weapon--the cannon--which had a range of about 100 yards.  The result was that virtually every offensive action in the Civil War, by either side, lost.<br />The much maligned Union generals (McClellan, Meade, Burnside, and Hooker) all reacted to one degree or another by hesitating to make any movement whatsoever.<br />The underlying hypothesis of &quot;Lost Victories&quot; is that Jackson is the one general in the war who figured out that the only way to win is to use the South's vast advantage in manueverability to gain positions which required the Union onto the attack.\<br />The detailed descriptions of the many battles leading up to Chancelorsville (recounted elsewhere endlessly) are here used to demonstrate the truth of the hypothesis that frontal attacks were always suicidal.<br />Less successful is the author's attempt to demonstrate that Jackson had figured out the answer.  the only time he was permitted to try (Chancelorsville), he was killed (by friendly fire) before the battle was over. While there is an argument (well made here) that the battle would have been won by the South had Lee only continued with Jackson's battle plan.  Nonetheless, the fact is it was not.<br />The epilogue consists of a lengthy speculation as to whether Jackson could have repeated his early success at Chancelorsville, and ultimately avoided Gettysburg and won the war.<br />A good argument, but the author completely ignores the western (Mississippi) front, the overwhelming Union advantage in manpower, and the ultimately decisive imbalance of material resources (wouldn't Jackson have run out of food, clothing and bullets, just like Lee, regardless of his strategic brilliance).<br />In sum, this is the best book I have read on the interplay between technology and strategy in the Civil War.  Otherwise it is an interesting, but ultimately unconvincing, speculation on whether the South could have won had Jackson been in charge.n the interplay between technology and strategy in the Civil War.

Books	5	4	9	N	N	Good on the Holocaust; good on What is History	Having recently viewed the Holocaust Memorial in Washington, D.C., I was looking for a book which gave further background on this event which shaped the 20th Century.  I found it, and much more.<br />The authors have actually given us three very good books in one.  Their &quot;first&quot; book is an analysis of those who deny that the holocaust happened, and review of the evidence which proves that it did.  Rather than a dry discussion of competing theories, the authors present a compelling story, well written, and disturbing, which propels the reader to the end of the book, and left (at least me) wanting to read more!  What more can you ask of a book.  On this level alone, I would have given this book its well deserved five stars.  But there is so much more...<br />Added to this traditional discussion of historical evidence is an (unexpected) bonus--a detailed discussion of the philosophy of history--what do we mean when we refer to history, how do we ever &quot;know&quot; what happened in the past, and how do you decide if a historian has it &quot;right&quot;?  they trace the history of history through three stages, culminating in the currently accepted &quot;scientific method&quot; of studying history--deriving hypotheses, and them testing them to see if they explain the existing evidene of what happened in the past better than any other hypothesis.  As the lines of evidence &quot;congverge&quot; on a singe explanation, then that explanation is accepted as &quot;true&quot;, until someone comes along with a better explanation which explains more of the &quot;evidence&quot;.<br />Finally, the extensive bibliography provides an excellent source for a review of books on the holocaust (at least through the late 90's), including the &quot;deniers&quot; works.  Anyone interested in further reading thus has an excellent bibliography to guide her.<br />Highly recommmended.	2003-08-30

Having just returned from Gettysburg, I decided this would be a good time to read this too long postponed historical novel.  Rather than tell a traditional &quot;narrative&quot; of battle, Killer Angels looks at events through the wholly subjective (and incredibly blind) eyes of five participants (contrary to another reviewer, Grant was not involved, and plays no part in this novel).<br />Despite the extreme limitations of knowledge of each of the characters--which characterizes even current military battles, despite increased technology, the reader gets a very good sense of the over all ebb and flow of what happened, why generals made the decisions they did, and how much of war depnds on luck and the unanticipated consequences of decisions made for entirely different reasons.<br />The prime example, which forms the ceterpiece of the book, is Chamberlain's defense of the Union flank at Little Round Top.  Having the vastly superior position, but the uneviable job of being the far right of the Union lines, Chambelin finds his troops at dusk without enough bullets to fight off another Confederate charge.  Nonetheless, he has orders not to retreat, no mattter what, because if he does, then the Confederates will be able to gain the high gtround from the rear, and the Union position will become untenable.<br />When the Confederates charge, out of complete desperation, Chamberlain orders a bayonette charge.  This appears completely suicidal (and Chamberlain probably thought that he was ordering his troops to certain death).  Bayonettes in the face of bullets do not have a good track record.  However, when the Confederate troops saw the charging Union soldiers, they panicked and retreated.  Thus the day was saved, the battle won, and many would say, the course fo the war changed forever.  Yet, the decision was made not out of bravery of tactics, but out of desperation.<br />As good as the battle descriptions are, even more powerful are the scenes in which generals on both sides wrestle with the fact that they are issuing orders which will result in thousands of men killing thousands of their fellow citizens, and in many cases, the generals facing each other were good friends before the war. Shaara's strength is making this impossible tragedy make sense, from both sides.<br />Shaara closes his book with a quote from Winston Churchill about how the Civil War was the bloodiest, yet least preventible wars in history.  Once the tragic commitment to slavery had been made, Civil War was sure to follow.  The result was a massive purging of the great American dilemna through the blood of brothers.  &quot;Where were the angels?&quot;, is a question every reader should ask.ides wrestle with the fact that they are issuing orders which will result in thousands of men killing thousands of their fellow citizens, and in many cases, the generals facing each other were good friends before the war.

Fund provides an excellent antidote to this time-warped perspective.  Brown vs. Board did not come out of no where, it did not revolutionize race relations over night, and it is not all that the Fund did.<br />Historically, Greenberg provides an overview of the decades long legal strategy, begun prior to the War, which lead up to the Brown decision, and the decade of extraordinarily frustrating litigation that followed.  While Brown is an important turning point, it was preceded by a long series of carefully orchestrated piecemal attacks on segregation, each victory carefully built upon until the time was ripe for the Supreme Court to render a favorable decision in a frontal attack on the entire system of legally mandated segregation in Brown.<br />But the Inc. Fund did so much more.  It lead the way in employment discrimination, death penalty reform/abolition, prisoners rights, and many, many other fields.  During the approximately 30 years covered by Greenberg in depth, no one, including the United States Department of Justice, had a broader array of civil rights cases, and no one other  than the United States Government appeared more often before the Supreme Court.<br />An interesting by play throughout the book is the role of racial tension within the &quot;movement&quot;.  As a white civil rights lawyer, Greenberg was an easy target for all who believed that the struggle against segregation should be lead by blacks.  At the same time, there was much soul searching within the NAACP as to how they could discriminate against Greenberg soley because he was wihite, given that the NAACP's reason d'etre was to battle racial discrimination.<br />One final note, while paying appropriate homage to Thurgood Marshall, Greenberg dispells the myth that the Inc. Fund was a one man shop.  Its work continued for many years after Marshall left to join the government (one of Lyndon Johnson's finest hours), and continues today.<br />It is a shame that such a worth while book is no longer in print, and never made it out as a paperback.  Everyone interested in the judicial system, the post war history of America, or the civil rights movement should read this book.the myth that the Inc. Fund was a one man shop.

DuBois was born 2 years after slavery was abolished, and died two years before the wide ranging civil rights acts of 1965 were enacted.  During this century, America was transformed from a largely rural nation whose economy depended on agricultural production (not the least of which was the cotton grown in the south by slaves) to an urban nation with the world's largest economy, built on industrial production.  Throughout most of this transformation, DuBois was the loudest and clearest voice proclaiming the injustices suffered by the nation's Blacks.<br />DuBois voice took many forms.  He was the nation's leading Black Sociologist, Political Scientist and Hstorian scholar for most of his life.  He was among the giants, regardless of race, in each of these fields.  This alone would have been remarkable, even had he not had to struggle against the burden of racism every step of the way.  What makes DuBois' life truly amazing (an over used word, which is fully justified here) is that in addition to his academic leadership, DuBois was a newspaper columnist, speaker, and founded dozens of popular mass organizations (most famously, the NAACP).  He was quite literally the mentor of virtually every leading Black scholar, lawyer, business man, politician, etc. that followed.<br />Surprisingly, given the transformation of the rest of society, DuBois retained his leadership role in the country as his many competitors and detractors faded--Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, and Walter White, among others.<br />Lewis has produced a masterful biography of this complex, vastly under rated man.  Lewis keeps his writing interesting, as he traces the twists and turns DuBois was forced to follow in his battle against racism.  He began with a traditional middle class, elite (which DuBois dubbed &quot;the talented tenth&quot;) analysis which urged the white power structure to recognize that elite blacks were as crucial to the nation's future as were the elite of the white population.  He ended as a communist, victim of McCarthy, having given up all hope of democratic change, living in exile in Ghana, where he was finally accorded the unstinting respect he was denied during the first 90 years of his life in America.<br />Lewis gives DuBois final years short shrift.  Lewis seems to agree with most of the contemporary civil rights leaders, who thought DuBois had simply lost his marbles in his dotage.  Lewis therefore skims over the last two decades of DuBois life in a few all too brief pages.<br />I beg to differ.  I believe that DuBois' thinking was an entirely accurate reflection of the frustrations he had encountered.  As Lewis hints at, but fails to explore, DuBois tried every conceivable means of combating America's deep seated racism.  He was rejected at every turn.  Despite apparent victories, many would have said that the plight of Blacks at the end of DuBois' long life was not very much improved over their plight at the beginning of his life.  The white controlled governments, universities, financial instutions, and political parties had not embraced the black elite, and the black masses had yet to see any benefit from the legal victories won by Thurgood Marshall and the Inc, Fund in the late 50's.<br />Lewis quotes DuBois aunt as chastizing DuBois for his attacks on Booker T. Washington as a quisling--DuBois may have grown up facing racism, but he did not have the whip marks of slavery on his back that Washington had suffered.  Similarly, those who criticize DuBois for his emrace of communism had not suffered the frustrations of almost a century of struggle during which everything in America had changed--except its racism.<br />As DuBois lay dying, virtually his last words were to the President of Ghana, apologizing for not living long enough to &quot;finish&quot; his work.<br />I know of no one who was more reviled during his lifetime that better deserves the masterful biography Lewis has given us, and given to the ages.<br />Everyone should not only read Lewis, but should go back and re-read some of DuBois own works.

That is, some people had to be able to produce more than they consumed before they could have anything to invest.<br />Williams contribution to the literature of this transformation is to focus on the role of the slave trade.  On the one hand, it provided a source of raw materials (human beings) which could be sold at a profit by traders, and then used to produce even more wealth by the buyers (slaveholders).  This double accumulation of wealth went a long way toward allowing a few very wealthy people to accumulate capital, which coul;d then be invested in things like machinery.<br />At the same time, the slave trade provided an economic foundation for a large scale international trading network (the famous molasses, slave, rum triangle, later includeing cotton).  Without this international network of shippers and merchants, the English (and later New England) cotton mills would not have had anywhere to sell their manufactured product (cotton cloth), nor a cheap source of cotton to use as raw materials.<br />Williams' ground breaking contirbution was to link all of this together, and argue that without the immoral slave trade, the industrial revolution, and thus capitalism as we know it, would not have happened.  The inescapable conclusion is that since much of modern wealth was founded on slavery, some form of reparations is warranted.	2003-08-02

Like the  first two books, Goodkind combines magic, action, and good old human frailty and self doubt into a page turning story which makes the reader desperate to find out what happened to these characters after the book ends.<br />That said, this book was not up to the quality of the first two installments of the Sword of Truth series.  First, the action sequences were too short and not well connected to the rest of the plot.  But more importantly, by having his main characters spread all through his Old and New Worlds, not knowing what each of the others were doing, lead to a disconnected plot.  There were simply too many unknowns, which despite  the 600+ page length, were never meshed into a coherent story.<br />Finally, Goodkind spent far to much of the book first setting up the penultimate battle between good and evil--actually two battles--and then spent too much time setting up what were obvious tantalizers to the next installment in the series.<br />On the positive side, we did learn all about Gars and Mirswiths--making them seem like thinking, sentient beings rather than just creatures of magic programmed to be good or evil.<br />All in all, a good read--but definitely don't start the series here.  Must read one and two first, or this book will be a waste.	2003-07-16

Rather than devote the book to an asserition of his innocence (today, neither of his \\"crimes\\" exist, and the laws prohibiting his \\"criminal\\" actions have long been held unconstitutional), Debs uses his personal experiences to highlight the absurdities and brutality of prisons as they are operated in the U.S.<br />Despite the fact that this book describes prison life over 80 years ago, much of what Debs has to say remains fully applicable to U.S. prisons in 2003.  We still lock up people who suffer from drug addiction, rather than offering them treatment; we still incarcerate young people for decades (far longer than when Debs wrote), and act surprised when they develope a \\"criminal mentality\\" after spending their entire adult lives in prison.  The U.S. still incarcerates a higher percentage of its population than any other countyr in the world, and hands out longer sentences than almost any other country.<br />Most tellingly, the prison population still consists almost exclusively of the very poorest members of society.  It is still rare to find a weealthy man in any prison in America.<br />The only reason I did not give this book five stars is because the publisher takced three speeches given by Debs after his release onto the end of the book.  They add absolutely nothing, and lack the cogent analysis of the rest of the book.<br />Anyone who is interested in crime in American, and certainly anyone with an interest in prisons, should read this all too relevant 80 year old book.	2003-05-03

At the same time, it has the most effective system in the world for restricting what its citizens think.<br />Focusing on the Israel-Palestine dispute (but with forays as far abroad as Hiroshima, Guatemala, Afghanistan, and--most relevantly for today--Iraq), Chomsky proves over and over again that the US version of terrorism is completely one sided.  After all, he argues, it is the US that has killed more civilians in more attempts to influence enemies through terror than any other country.<br />Chomsky gives short shrift to those who argue endlessly over the legal meaning of various UN Resolutions to determine what the legalities are of various conflicts.  Applying his philosophical theories to politics, Chomsky says that words mean exactly what those with the power to act say they mean, nothing more and nothing less.<br />Chomsky's bottom line is that if the US really wants to combat terrorism, the first thing we ought to do is stop practicing it, and stop supporting others who do so.<br />Chomsky certainly has a point of view that one hears all too infrequently in this country.  My main criticism is that the book repeats the same examples several times in different chapters to make the same point.  This results from the fact that the book is actually a loosely connected series of essays and talks, not originally wirtten at the same time, let alone with a book in mind.	2003-04-03

Having apparently unlimited access to the developers allows her to see the entire process of urban renewal from conception to fruition from the inside.  The size of this project is unique for a private development:  Dearborn Homes originally was meant to encompass the entire area directly south of Chicago's loop.  Its backers were alos unique--the real movers and shakers of Chicago's business community between the late 60's and the early 80's.<br />The fact that deveklopment of Dearborn park spanned so many administrations in Chicago (including Daley I, Harold Washington, and Daley II) means that the politics involved were complex.  Dearborn Park also became the focus of several intense community struggles--sometimes directly related to the development, and sometimes the development was only part of a much larger struggle over the general direction of development in Chicago.<br />The weakness of Wille's book derives directly from its strength.  While Wille provides an unmatched view of the development porocess from the developer's prospective, Wille gives short shrift to the perspective of politicians and other City officials (who come accross as shallow people who stand in the way of the development for no apparent reason), and woefully short shrifts the very powerful grass roots movement which challenged the City's concentration on developing middle and upper income housing, at the expense of low cost housing.<br />Ultimately, Dearborn Park can only be understood as part of this larger debate on the direction of the City of Chicago.  Wille has produced a book unmatched for its insights into the actions and motivations of one set of players in this debate--Chicago's major financial and real estate institutions.  The book does not, however, tell the story from any other perspective.	2003-03-29

She clearly had no choice in most of her life--abusive step-father, grinding poverty, Native American ancestry.  Yet she makes a conscious choice to leave.  Then fate, in the form of a traffic stop, intervenes.  Then, as she finally makes a new choice--to embrace her heritage--fate again conspires to crush her, first in the form of an older boy who makes unwanted advances, and then in the form of all consuming fire.<br />So, was Sky's life path a result of her conscious choices or of forces completely beyond her control?  That is the theme Evans explores in the entire rest of the book.<br />The detour through war torn Uganda was, admittedly, a little out of the way.  In earlier times--think, Thomas Hardy's Return of the Native, similar &quot;far away&quot; imagery could be obtained by having a character wander the moors, go to London, etc.  However, our world is smaller.  How could all communication between Collin and Julia have been broken in a believable way if he had simply gone, for example, to New York?	2003-03-09

Board of Education	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Excellent rebuttal critics of school desegregation	In 1954, the United States Supreme Court decided Brown vs. Board of Education, probably the Supreme Court decision which has had the most far ranging impact on America since marburry v. Madison.<br />There have been a rash of books lately by conservatives, claiming that school desegregation has been an abject failure.  Orfield, et al, ably rebut this criticism.<br />School desegregation was never given a chance to work.  From 1954 until 1968, school desegregation consisted almost entirely of symbolic gestures in a few isolated communities, set against a broad southern strategy of northern resistance.<br />From 1968 until 1974--a short 6 years, school desegregation was accomplished throughout the south.  Then the courts turned their gaze north, and the Supreme Court quickly retrenched--abandoning busing, and ruling that housing segregatioin had nothing to do with school desegregation--rather, housing segregation was a matter of &quot;choice&quot;.  Once that fateful decision was made, the North did not have to desegregate, and many southern cities were free to resegregate.<br />Since true, wide spread desegregation, even in the South, only lasted a few short years, it is no surprise that there were few results to show.  Orfield et al, however, make an excellent case that the criticism and statistics purporting to show that desegregation accomplished nothing are wrong.  Where there is data, it shows that desegregation did exactly what it was supposed to do--even out the playing field for Black and White students.<br />The problem with the book ios that it is not so much a book as a series of academic studies, with the technical jargon (mostly) removed, and then grouped together in a single volume.  This approach leads to needless duplication, and a complete failure to draw some conclusions which only become apparent by chance.<br />The authors of Dismantling Segregation make no attempt to connect the dots between the different stories.  Taken together, the case tudies included in this volume strongly suggest that there was an organized effort among a relatively small group of lawyers, politicians, and educators to dismantle segregation.  Who the players were, and what interests they represented, however, wil have to await another book.included in this volume strongly suggest that there was an organized effort among a relatively small group of lawyers, politicians, and educators to dismantle segregation.

Shakey identification.  All white judge, jury, police, sheriff, and all lawyers on both sides.  A death penalty case.  A jury in the midst of trial jumps up and threatens to rip the defendant's heart out on the spot.  He is found guilty.  From date of crime to guilty verdict--one week.  Defendant advised by his own lawyers after trial:  you have two choices, waive appeal and let the State execute you, or appeal and let the mob lynch you.<br />Then two Black lawyers take up the case.  The Supreme Court is horrified at the gross miscarriage of justice, and issues a stay.  But the mob, with the Sheriff's apparent approval, decides the legal process is just taking too long, and lynches the defendant.<br />Contempt of Court tells this story in great detail, bringing all of the characters to life.  A fascinating history of the role racism played in the courts at the turn of the century.<br />But the heart of the book is what followed the lynching.  Unlike most cases which were quickly forgotten, the Supreme Court itself instituted contempt charges against the Sheriff for failing to carry out its stay of execution.  This is the one and only contempt proceeding ever tried in the Supreme Court itself.  It also marked the first time the federal courts had ever sought to review a state court criminal proceeding--setting the stage for such well known rules as \\"Miranda\\" and the exclusionary rule.<br />I completely agree with the blurb on the book's cover.  This volume belongs on the shelf next to Simple Justice and Gideon's Trumpet.	2003-02-18

It will not be the last I read.<br />Connelly sets his murder mystery in a high-tech, bio-genetics world.  Following the Ludlum et al formula, he takes a high-powered acheiver out of his usual world, and drops him in the middle of a chaotic murder plot--or at least that what it seems at first.<br />The deeper we get into the book, the more we see that the apparent chaos has an order to it.  The revelations which are most important to the plot are not the typical \\"who done it\\", but the hidden interrelationships between teh characters, and their histories.<br />According to other reviews, some of the back story in this book is set out in an earlier Connelly book, but you certainly do not need to have read the earlier books to enjoy this one.  Of course, having read this one, I will definitely have to go out and get the \\"back story\\" book!<br />My only criticism is that the plot takes too huge a jump at the end to \\"reveal\\" the solution.  There needs to be more set up to explain why several characters completely change their stripes.<br />That said, it is a book that anyone should enjoy who likes a good page turner.	2003-01-02

He uses this back ground to provide a comprehensive (pre-Cole and pre-9/11) look at the complex international financial and personnel structure bin Laden built to support international terrorism.<br />While bin Laden was not the spiritual or military leader of the islamic terrorist movement, he is the one who made it viable.  He raised the money, developed an international series of interlocking corporations, foundations, and local groups which allowed for the movement of large amounts of money, equipment, and people everywhere from the Phillipines to (as we now know all to well) New York City.<br />The problem with this book is there are no sources cited.  THere is absolutely no way to check the accuracy of Bodansky's narrative.  In effect, Bodansky asks the reader to acdept what he says i true based on Bodansky's credentials alone.<br />It all sounds plausible, particularly in light of September 11, but I found it very uncomfortable having no way to check Bodansky's assertions.  Several other reviewers have noted specific inaccuracies--but frankly, none of them touch on the heart of Bodansky's point--that bin Laden is a very competnet paymaster for a wide ranging, extremely dangerous terrorist organization.	2002-12-29

This makes him uniquely qualified to explain what about Afghanistan made it so attractive to bin Laden, et al, and how Afghanistan got that way.<br />In addition to providing local background, Rashid delves into the history of the machinations of the US oil companies, and their attempts to build a pipeline through Afghanistan, and how that effort drove much of the US policy over the years.  As they say about Mousolinni, the Taliban made the trains run on time.  Heroine production was down, the tax system was rationalized, and international smuggling became again profitable.<br />Of course, the Taliban also oppressed women (and anyone else who did not adhere to their strict brand of Islam), destroyed loocal agriculture, and presided over mass starvation.<br />Rashid leaves no doubt that the efforts of the Russians, the Americans, the oil companies, and the Taliban, made the country  ripe for occupation by Al Queda.

He founded one of Washington's most prestigeous law firms, and became the lawyer for a vast array of clients, ranging from Peurto Rico to many large corporations who wanted something from Uncle Sam.<br />But his career will forever be defined by his relationship with Lyndon Johnson.  More than Johnson's personal lawyer (which he was), he was also Johnson's political confidant.<br />Not surprisingly, when Johnson had a chance to fill a Supreme Court seat, he gave it to Fortas.  Fortas did not want it, and Murphy's description of Johnson's ploy to force Fortas to accept Johnson's &quot;gift&quot; is one of the most telling stories I have ever read about Johnosn.<br />The problem was, once on the Court, Johnson still treated Fortas as both his personal lawyer and his political advisor.  Fortas' relationship with Johnson may have gone un noticed, but Johnson decided to do Fortas a second (unwanted) favor, by appointing him as Chief Justice when Warren retired.<br />The tragedy of the Senate confirmation hearings form the center of this remarkable book.  As a study in the raw workings of politics (presidential, congressional, and on the court itself), it is unsurpassed.

Anyone who cares about how Afghanistan and the surrounding countries ended up the way they did must read The Great Game--Hopkirk's gripping description of the battle between Russia and England for control of Central Asia--a hint:  they both lost.<br />This volume picks up the story with the Russian Revolution.  Again, Hopkirk does an excellent job of out lining the players, the global politics, and how it all impacted on this traditional \\"crossroads of the world\\".  Here, the focus is on Lenin, and Russia's (successful) attempt to claim/re-claim Central asia as its own.<br />My criticisim is that the story is not nearly as gripping as a story as was the Great Game.  There are superb vignettes, but the overall narrative is simply not as good.<br />However, if you want to know why Russia was willing to dvote a decade (1980 to 1990) to its war in Afghanistan, which set the stage for the Taliban and Al Queda, then I know of no better book.	2002-12-29

She makes no apologies for him, and has great insight to how she ended up married to him.<br />The heart of the book is her description of the pain she and her family experienced after he was convicted.  The long trips to prison, the attempt to maintain a long distance relationship, the prison's unannounced, arbitrary transfers of her husband thousands of miles away.  Through it all, both Lourdes and her husband determined not to give in to the madness, but to work to reform this arbitrary prison system--he from the inside, her by organizing other family members.<br />This choice caused both some pain.  But it seems to allowed both to survive an extremely difficult situation with their personal dignity intact.  An inspiring book.	2002-12-29

He did so, week after week, often without money, and occassionally despite violent attacks by pro-slavery forces.  He refused compromise.  He refused to accept &quot;workable&quot; solutions.  Slavery was morally bankrupt, and he fought against it, using the power of words alone.<br />When he began his crusade, slavery was accepted, and most people thought it was here to stay.  Garrsison was a voice crying in the dark.  When he closed down The Liberator, slavery was over, and the vast majority of the country thought it was wrong.<br />Anyone who reads, anyone who fights for social justice, and certainly anyone who writes should read this book.  It is hard to imagine anyone whose life reflects the axiom: &quot;the pen is mightier than the sword&quot; better than Garrison.	2002-12-29

Rather, he exp;ores the various ways public policy was manipulated (generally by commercial interests) to serve their own ends, and how those profit driven manipulations resulted in Chicago being one of America's most segregated cities.  Ironically, the dramatic expansion of the Black Ghetto chronicalled by Hirsch occurred at the same time that the country was under seige by the forces of McCarthism...yet in Chicago, the commercial interests (lead by Marshall Field) had no compunction about seizing private property to serve their own ends.<br />Anyone who believes that neighborhoods are segregated because of private choices must read this book and learn the truth.	2002-12-28

Anyone who wants to move beyond the headlines, and find out more about the strengths and weaknesses of life in a public housing development should read this book.<br />That said, the author's background and training as a sociologist comes through loud and clear, and ultimately limits his book.  While Venkatesh does a good job of detailing the social relationships among the players, he virtually ignores the larger political issues.  Why was management so inept as to be virtually non-existent?  Why did the drug/crime culture take hold, and how did the gangs transfor themselves into multi-state corporate enterprises?  Most importantly, given that CHA is now in the process of demolishing virtually everyone of the buildings which form Robert taylor Homes, how do we avoid creating the same problems in the next generation of public housing.<br />Excellent bibliography, by the way.

He covers everything from the Vietnam War to the Civil Rights movement, to the hypocrasy of the Catholic Church, to the problems with our criminal justice system.<br />While now 30 years old, Father Berrigan's writings remain relevent today.  His challenge to the Catholic Church is particularly apt, as the Church today is being shaken to its foundations by allegations of sexual abuse.<br />His challenge to the war mentality which rules so much of America's foreign policy rings true as applied to the current debate over invasion of Iraq.<br />While many disagreed with Father Berrigan, the world could surely use more principled voices, willing to dedicate their lives to asking the rest of us if we are not abandoning sanity in order to fulfill our visions of the \\"good life.\\"  His untimely death this Fall has deprived us all of a much needed voice urging peace.	2002-12-26

But his history goes far beyond those headlines.  He worked as a priest in the heart of Baltimore's black ghetto at the height of the civil rights movement, and continued his work with the poor and his anti-war resistance until he died in December, 2002.<br />This is in many ways a follow-up to Berrigan's earlier diaries of a Revolutionary Priest.  The entries in this volume begin after Father Berrigan was captured by the FBI (he was living underground, refusing to voluntarily begin serving what he considered an illegal sentence) and end with his release on parole.  In between, he chronicles the tragi-comedy of Hoover's vendetta, in which Father Berrigan and 7 others were charged and tried for a wide-ranging conspiracy, the heart of which was an alleged plot to blow up the utility tunnels serving government buildings in D.C., and to kidnap Henry Kissenger.  Along the way, he significantly alters his view of lawyers (at least some of them) and the positive role they can play in \\"movement\\" cases.  He also marries Sister Liz McAllister--a nun.<br />Despite the age of this book, Father Berrigan's message remains vital for our times.  With war on Iraq looming, Berrigan's opposition to the use of violence to enforce America's privileged status in the world should be read by every thinking citizen.  With the Catholic Church in the midst of self-destruction, Berrigan's conscientious opposition to the Church heirarchy rings truer than ever.  How anyone still believes that it was Philip Berrigan and Liz McAllister were wrong in marrying, might ask which was more immoral:  two people who were committed to the movement against war, poverty and violence and to each other, or the Church heirarchy who were protecting child molesters at the same time they were condemning Berrigan?<br />The world is worse off having lost such a powerful voice for peace and justice.lost such a powerful voice for peace and justice.	2002-12-26

Board of Education: A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy (Pivotal Moments in American History)	Books	4	13	15	N	N	America's Second Revolution	Patterson succeeds in writing a very different book than Kruger's unequaled \\"Simple Justice.\\"  While Simple Justice told the story of how Brown v. Board of Education came to be, Paterson asks whether Brown should have been.<br />After giving a brief history of Brown (covering, in summary fashion, much of the ground covered by Kruger), Patterson examines the aftermath of Brown.  The question Patterson addresses throughout the book is whether Brown marked a step forward in civil rights.<br />Patterson successfully debunks the argument that Brown was a step backwards.  As he says, anyone who thinks that the country was better off before Brown had better buy a two way ticket if he wants to go back in time, because he will want to turn right around and come back.  Before Brown, most black children were educated in tarpaper shacks, by grossly underpaid teachers, with no supplies, and even less respect.<br />Did Brown solve all problems?  Of course not.  As Patterson notes, what Brown does do is prove that there are limits to the power of the courts to accomplish social change.  However, the Supreme Court did set an unequivocal moral tone, which set the stage for the civil rights movement, which (building on the constitutional foundation built by Brown) changed the world we all live in.<br />Has racism ended?  No.  But no one should expect any Supreme Court decision (or even a series of decisions spanning less than 25 years) to undo the racial history of this country which had taken 400 years to build.  The real shame is that beginning in the late 70's, the courts, Congress, and the President have all worked to reverse the moral tone set in Brown.  Unfortunately, they have succeeded all too well.  But one can not fairly blame that on the Supreme Court's decision in Brown.<br />A thought provoking book which should be read by anyone who is interested in the history of race relations in the second half of the 20th Century.	2002-11-11

Once the strategy of massive resistance took hold in the South, they were caught between having to follow the Supreme Court's directive in Brown, or continuing to be respected leaders of their own communities.<br />How they resolved this dichotomy makes for great reading, and is one of the most intense tests of character imaginable.	2002-11-11

Board of Ed--but tragically died in 1950, just as this historic litigation was getting underway.<br />It is hard to imagine any other lawyer--not to mention a Black lawyer in the 1940's who could have had a greater impact on the law as we know it.  A truly remarkable human being.  He not only gave birth to the NAACP's school desegregation campaign, but he also broke ground in employment discrimination, union rights, and many other developing fields of law; not to mention founding the modern day Howard Law School, which has served as the incubator for virtually all fo the civil rights litigation in the 20th Century, running a private practice, writing a regular newpaper column, and holding public office (the D.C. school board).<br />Ms. McRae thankfully spends only a brief time on his family history, and then gets right to the story of Houston's legal career.  However, one story from Houston's formative years is instructive:  When Houston served in the (segregated) Army (in WWI), he was appointed to decide the fate of a Black soldier.  His investigation showed that the alleged infraction had been blown out of proportion.  However, he was ordered by his superiors to find the soldier guilty, and sentence him to hard time in the brig.  As a result of this experience, Houston vowed to learn the law, so that he could devote his life to ensuring that Blacks could never again be subjected to this type of injustice.  He succeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams.<br />The moral?  I suppose the racist superior officer lived to regret the day that he set Charles Houston on the path of justice--a [ath which ultimately lead to the destruction of legally enforced racial segregation in America--talk about a short sighted victory for racism!<br />Anyone who is interested in reading the story of a true (but underappreciated) American hero would do well to read this book!	2002-11-09

It is the transformation of the orphans from &quot;Irish&quot;--a despised minority in New York--into &quot;White&quot;--a powerful minority in Arizona, as they took their 2,000 mile train ride to their new adopted homes.<br />The only reason that I did not rate this book five stars is because Ms. Gordon first does a very good job explaining the paucity of evidence for the actual abduction--poor people tend not to leave historical records.  However, she periodically leaps beyond this limited records into wild speculation (which may well be correct, but certainly is not supported by her evidence), all without acknowledging the contradiction.<br />All in all, well worth the read for anyone who is interested in the role race has played in american history--which ought to be all of us.	2002-01-10

Rowling grabs you, and doesn't ever let you go..emotional highs and lows, magic, tragedy and comedy all nicely tied together with a fast paced story.<br />But she has real things to say to the adult reader.  I completely disagree with a recent review which said the only moral to the story was that its okay to cheat, since everyone does.  To the contrary, being true to oneself has laways been rewarded in this series, and the current book is no exception.<br />Also, like much great literature, the book is also about literature.  Hogwarts is, of course a book--a place of magic hidden fromthe rest of the world, where many things are possible, and some rules need to be broken to keep things interesting.<br />By the way, Rowling's description of prison is so accurate, it makes one wonder who she has been talking to.  Prison does eventually leach away one's soul, til you loose all touch with reality.  The dementors are real.<br />Can't wait for book five--but what happens when we all finish seven?

In theory, the accords ended a war of almost 40 years.  This book focuses on the &quot;scorched earth&quot; campaign waged by the Guatemala army, which resulted in the displacement of over 2 million indigenous Mayans--many of whom were forced from the country and lived as refugees in Mexico for over a decade, while others made accomodations with the Army, or joined the guerrillas in resistance.<br />This book documents the after-effects of that decade-long displacement, as these three groups seek to recreate their pre-war community, in a country still subject to periodic out breaks of violence, while struggling with extreme poverty.<br />Clark provides an excellent analysis of both the effects of the scorched earth campaign, and the ongoing problems that campaign is causing at the village level.  Anyone who is interested in the effects of war on ordinary people should read this book.<br />As an aside, it is interesting how much the Guatemala Army learned from the U.S. experience in Vietnam.  The entire &quot;scorched earth&quot; campaign is clearly based on the concept of &quot;free fire zones&quot; first practiced by the US in the Mekong Delta, and recently made famous by the confessions of Senator Kerry.<br />Highly recommended to combat the idea that war can be faught without long term damage to a country.	2001-07-21

Only after he died did someone piece together his drafts into a &quot;finished&quot; novel.  Of course, it isn't finished--or Ellison would have sent it off to the publisher himself.  This explains why it meanders forever in spots, and doesn't have (in my opinion) a satisfactory end.<br />All that aside, I don't agree that this book is &quot;unreadable&quot; or a waste of time.  Ellison always had powerful things to say about race in America, and a mastery of language to bring to the task.<br />Ellison's point in Juneteenth is that Blacks are martyrs in their acceptance of the suffering imposed on them by whites, and that whites are irredemably evil--and, if I read the end right, damned to spend eternity in hell as a result.<br />Apparently this is true even if whites &quot;see the light&quot;, are reborn black, and raised black--as Bliss--one of the books two real characters--as, most obviously through nightly staged &quot;resurrection&quot; out of the coffin, but at least symbolically at birth, and then again when he suffers an almost fatal illness as a very young child.  Despite these early influences, as soon as Bliss reached adolesence, he abandoned blacks, turned white, and became a populist racist demagogue politician.<br />In contrast, Daddy Hickman (the other character) undergoes his own salvation (turning, through the influence of Bliss' birth and near fatal illness) from a life of a road musician to become a man of god.  Even as a traveling preacher, he becomes more Christ-like, in contrast to the typical portrayal in literature (and movies) of white evangilists as charltain hustlers.  In the end, Daddy Hickman apparently has the power to reach right into hell to try to save (yet again) Bliss from the eternal fire.  It is, of course, unclear whether Hickman succeeds in saving Bliss, but similarly it is unclear (I think this is Ellison's underlying message) whether white America is beyond salvation.<br />On one level, this is a book about the unsettled state of race relations in America.  On another level, the story of Bliss is the oft told story of balck and white friendship which is inevitably destroyed at adolesence (triggered here by a white female movie star).<br />I thought Juneteenth was interesting, certainly has a well defined point of view on American race relations, and continues (in spots) Ellison's powerful way with words.  But clearly this is not a finished novel, and no one should expect that it is when they pick it up.underlying message) whether white America is beyond salvation.<br />On one level, this is a book about the unsettled state of race relations in America.

But this is only the beginning of the blood that made Williamson (a small coal mining town in southern Illinois in the 1920's) Bloody!<br />The thugs didn't leave.  They rather liked having the run of the town.  Bootlegging, gang wars, and all [heck] breaks loose.<br />Its important to remember the context when reading this book--because the author doesn't give you much.  The worst race riots in American History happened a few miles away, in East St. Louis, in 1916--a few short years before the time covered in this book.  Unions hadn't been legally recognized--that came a few years later, amidst the depression.  Coal, and the economy in general, were booming.  The stock market was exploding.  And the federal government took the position that its role was to foster the wealth of the rich.<br />Anyone who thinks that political corruption is confined to big cities, hasn't spent much time in small town politics.  This book is an eye opener.  Of course, anyone who thinks that this sort of corruption is a part of America's long distant past, hasn't been reading the paper much recently.  Political shenanigans in down state Illinois are alive and well.  Of course, the big economic engine driving the southern Illinois economy today is the prison industry, but that's another book.

We now incarcerate about 2 million people--a higher rate than any other country in the world. Mr. Hallinan takes us on a tour of the prisons that hold this growing population...and serves up a unique view point.<br />When readcing Going Up the River, one must remember that the author works for the Wall Steet Journal.  With this &quot;day job&quot; it is not surprising that Mr. Hallinan delves into a side of the prison boom not often examined:  the costs, who pays them, and who profits?<br />Everyone seems to admit that prisons do not rehabilitate anyone.  They are so large, so poorly funded, and so violent, that the only realistic goal of either the prisoners or the gourds is to come out alive.  As Mr. Hallinan says, anything beyond survival is clearly a luxury in today's prisons.<br />So, if prisons are not doing their job, then why are they so popular?<br />Mr. Hallinan's answer is that the prison boom has been accompanied by (or was caused by?) a redefinition of the very concept of a prison.  No longer viewed as a place to incarcerate and reform or rehabilitate, prisons are now viewed as a source of economic development, jobs, and patronage.<br />His story of the building of Tamms--Illinois Supermax--is illustrative.  Built in a small, impoverished, southern Illinois town approximately 365 miles from Chicago, the prison was expected to be an economic engine.  As it was being built, the local housing market exploded, restaurants opened, etc.  At the same time, the county--which had gone democratic in state-wide races for decades, voted republican 2-1 after the Republican governor announced the new prison.<br />What the author missed is the end of the story.  After being open two years, Tamms has seen virtually no benefit from the prison.  The new restaurants are closed.  The new jobs went to experienced guards living elsewhere.  The real estate market in Tamms is as depressed as ever.<br />The question Mr. Hallinan asks at the end of his book is the right one--has America's addiction to prisons begun to wane?  Only time will tell, but the story of Tamms suggests that they ain't all they're cracked up to be as engines of economic development.<br />An excellent book, highly recommended for anyone who cares about crime or prisons--but an absolute must read for anyone who cares about taxes!tion Mr. Hallinan asks at the end of his book is the right one--has America's addiction to prisons begun to wane?

Bush's term as Governor of Texas-itself a largely ceremonial post-she describes a man with neither the talent for nor any discernable interest in being the President (or holding any other elective office for that matter).<br />W. was born into a degree of wealth that most of us can not even dream about.  This privilege has formed his entire outlook on life, and policy.  He instinctively believes that what is good for corporate America is best for the Country, and simply can not imagine thinking about issues in any other way.  He has zero intellectual curiosity, and no interest at all in figuring out how to work the levers of power in government.<br />He left the governing of Texas to others-appointed and elected heads of Boards, Commissions, and the (part time) legislature.  This worked (sort of) in Texas, where the Governor is largely a symbolic office.  However, it could spell disaster in the White House, where foreign leaders (not to mention us of the general populace) might expect him to actually have some interest and perhaps even knowledge about the issues confronting the nation.<br />Aside from the informative content, Ivins is a terrific writer.  Anyone not familiar with her columns is in for a pleasant surprise.  Humor, information, and terror, all in the same book.  Who can beat that?	2001-03-14

He assumes, without proving, that the true issue in impeachment is (or should be) the legal issue.  He virtually ignores the competing view, that the key issue is (and should be) political.  Only by reading this book in combination with Rhenquit's history of the Samuel Chase and Andrew Johnson impeachments can you get a more rounded view.<br />As a matter of law, Clinton was guilty.  However, we were not involved in a criminal trial.  We were deciding whether to remove this country's highest elected official.  This is a highly political question, to which the legal issues are relevent, but hardly decisive.<br />By failing to grapple honestly with this dichotomy, Posner's book ultimately falls short of being the definitive work on impeachment it could have been, given his incisive analysis of th elegal issues and the evidence.	2001-01-29

This book tells (part of) the story of the 30 year struggle for relief which followed that victory.<br />Initially, the court ordered more (non-segregated) public housing built.  That did not happen (at least for many years).  This book focuses on the secodn remedy tried:  the Section 8 mobility program, in which public housing residents were offered Section 8 housing subsidies (not otherwise available) in exchange for their agreement to relocate to white, middle class suburbs.<br />Admitting that the people who accepted this offer were both self-selected and carefully screened, the authors detail the generally positive effect these moves had on the participants, including much safer neighborhoods, generally better schools, and less racism than would be expected.  Given this limited goal, the book covers its subject superbly.<br />The question which this book avoids is whether this experiment actually benefited the class of plaintiffs who brought the case--or whether it benefitted them more than other possible remedies.  For example, what if each member of the class had simply been given cash--in an amount equal to whatever the government spent on the mobility and scattered site programs?  What if all of the money had been spent on aggressive enforcement of housing discrimination laws?  Similarly, the authors make no attempt to determine why most of the plaintiffs did not want to participate.<br />All in all, the book teaches some very valuable lessons about the positive effects of integration--proving the experts (Clark, et al) right who opined as long ago as Brown vs. Board of Education that segregation really does inflict harm on children.<br />Excellent read for anyone concerned about the issues of poverty and race.	2001-01-13

Some simply write letters.  Some picket, or go on strike, risking their jobs.  Some even go on a hunger strike for a few days.<br />The ten members of the IRA whose story is told (in incredibly moving detail) in this book take social protest to a level most of us are not familiar with.  They quite literally agreed to sacrifice their lives...not in one fell swoop (like those who set themselves on fire), but in a slow, agonizing death drawn out over many weeks.<br />This is true dedication to a cause.  Having read the book, one is tempted to view all other social protests as half-hearted.  Of course, their protest only made sense because of the mass organization and widespread support the strikers had, both inside the prison and on the street.  Bobby sands was actually elected to Parliment while dying!<br />Anyone who wants to learn about what it takes to effect change, and the pitfalls of adopting such radical tactics, must read this book.	2001-01-13

Imagine blasting a long tunnel through the Sierra's, in the dead of winter, working in from both ends and out from the middle, and making the tunnels connect.  Yet this is only one of the magnificent physical/engineering triumphs described by Ambrose.<br />So, why not five stars?  Ambrose mentions that building the railroad led to the creation of the first two modern large corporations (the Union Pacific--working from Iowa west and the Cnetral Pacific--working from Sacramento east).  He also details the huge amounts of cash which had to be raised to pay for materials and labor.  Where the book is weak is in his description of where this money came from.  Who were the investors?  Where was this capital invested previously?  One can get some idea of the answers to these questions by reading the recent biographies of the Rothschild family and JP Morgan.  I would have liked to see those stories integrated into Ambrose's otherwise magnificent book.	2001-01-07

Anderson's thesis, which he documents very well, is that this was really the &quot;first world war&quot; in history.  It is only because of our peculiarly american-centric perspective that we ignore it in the country.  In fact, this earlier war was much more important to the world at large.<br />In addition, even from our own parochial perspective, the earlier war really did determine (or at least strongly influenced) the outcome of the revolutionary war a decade or so later.<br />My criticism is with the writing.  While much of the book sizzled, at times it became plodding, slogging through yet another campaign which went no where, had no participants we'd heard of, and decided nothing--of course, such was the war.  But does the book have to mirror the reality quite so well?<br />All in all, though, the inforamtion vastly outweighs my concerns about the writing.  Highly recommended reading for anyone who wants to understand how we got where we are today.	2001-01-07

Witten by a former Latin King who joined at a very young age, and quickly rose through the ranks to become a street level leader.<br />During this period, he became addicted to drugs, and his life spiraled out of control.  The only reason he is alive to write this book is that he got out before he hit his late teens.<br />The book lays out in great and convincing detail what it means to be a member of a street gang.  One forgets that the author did everything that he describes in about three years (the time line is apparently intentionally fudged), and all before he reached adulthood.<br />The only warning I would give is that the book does not really explore the higher reaches of the gang structure.  The author readily admits that he never came anywhere near that level, and was used and abused by those that did.  That is the book I am waiting for.	2000-11-21

During three to four months in 1994 (roughly April through June), somewhere between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Rwandans were murdered.  This was not random killing, or a declared war.  Rather, it was systematic genocide of the Tutsis by the Hutu.  Since there  were only slightly more that 1,000,000, Tutsi's living in Rawanda when this  started, Gourevitch makes a convincing argument that this massacre was far  more devastating than was the only comparable event in history, the German  attempt to exterminate all Jews during WWII.<br />Several things make these  events even more extraordinary (and disturbing).  Tutsi's and Hutu's are  essentially the same ethnically.  The differences are largely class  distinctions, imposed by the Europeans who colonized the area, and created  a myth that those in the native population who looked more  &quot;European&quot; were from a superior racial group.  They were then  given greater access to education, government jobs, etc.  After a couple of  generations, the so called Tutsi's became the superior class, because of  the favoritism of the powers that be.<br />Nonetheless, Hutu's and Tutsi's  continued to intermarry, live together, etc.  This leads to the second  point, which is that the genocide was largely committed by friends and  relatives of the victims.  The third, and closely related, point is that  this was not a case of high tech, anonymous slaughter.  There were no gas  chambers, or high altitude bombings here which served to  &quot;insulate&quot; the murderers from their victims.  Instead, they  literally hacked their neighbors to death with machetes.<br />The final thing  is that, after the genocide ended, the Tutsi's returned to power.  The  second half of the book explores the efforts of the new government to  strike a balance between justice, the desire for revenge, and the need to  move the country toward normalcy.  As the author points out, virtually no  one in the country was untouched.  A very large percentage of the populace  was directly involved in the genocide (each victim was often killed by a  mob, so there may well have been more killers than victims).  Everyone had  a close relative who was either murdered or a murderer.  This is the first  time in history that the murderers and victims have made any attempt to  recreate a county in which they have to live and work side by side.<br />The  final point is that the international community completely ignored this  entire episode, and in fact immediately complained that the victims were  &quot;harping&quot; on the genocide instead of &quot;moving on.&quot;  All  of the aid was focused on the surviving murderers, who fled Rawanda to  avoid justice, and virtually none (for at least the first 2 years) was  given to the survivors.<br />The questions posed, but not really answered,  are what makes a person act this way?  This question, of course, applies  not only to Rawanda, but also to Germany (Hitler's Willing Executioners is  an excellent companion to this book).  Even more fundamentally, the  question applies to slavery, and the subsequent history of race  relationships in this country.  Only by believing that slaves were somehow  not &quot;really&quot; human could the slaveholders justify their own  actions, to themselves and to the world.  On a broader scale, the question  also applies to war in general.  Recall how US soldiers were notorious in  dehumanizing the Vietnamese--gooks, etc., as a way of allowing them to kill  at will.<br />A powerful and thought provoking book.ouched.

This book provides his account of his experiences in one maximum security, overcrowded,  violent prison near Philadelphia, PA.<br />I have never visited the prison he  describes, and thus can not comment on the factual accuracy of the events  described.  However, having spent endless hours with inmates in similar  prisons, I believe that he has certainly captured the essence of being an  inmate in this type of prison.  It is well written, and provides stories,  from which the reader is allowed to draw his or her on conclusions.  He  does not preach, but tells his story simply and compellingly.<br />Since this  country is sending an increasing number of young people to live out most of  their lives in prison, all or us should be aware of what we are doing.  This book accomplishes that purpose.<br />Unlike some other similar books  (Jack Abbott's, Belly of the Beast, comes to mind), Hassine does not focus  exclusively on the negatives of prison life.  This is not a &quot;prison  destroyed my life&quot; rant.  Rather, it is a successful attempt to give a  balanced view of day-to-day life in prison. The overwhelming fact of which  is constant boredom, with a heavy overlay of barely supressed violence  (mostly by other inmates, but occassionally from guards).<br />My only  criticism is that the introductory comments of the editor (thankfully  short) interspersed throughout the book are distracting and  unnecessary.<br />All in all, for anyone interested in learning what life is  like in America's prosons, this book is highly recommended.	1999-02-12
