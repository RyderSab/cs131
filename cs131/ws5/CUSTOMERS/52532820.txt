US	52532820	RHJMO7PV60CS5	0345435249	147883919	Darwin's Radio	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Adendum to my earlier review...	Upon further reflection, I have some additional comments to share about this about this book.<br />Here's the main one...once the book gets rolling (after about 70 pp.) it's great.  The greatest weakeness of the book, however, is in its conclusion.  I won't say exactly what that is, since I do hope you decide to read this book...but suffice it to say that there is a strong developmetal evolution component to the conclusion.  Here's my main criticism...<br />The virus that is the focus of the book has significant developmental effects, not only on new offspring, but also on adults who have the virus -- this raises interesting and extremely unlikely results in the book.  It is unlikely, for example, for adults to undergo what amounts to structural developmental change as the result of a virus, even one that triggers a cascade of genetic expression.<br />The possibility of such change is much more likely in a developing embryo/fetus, which has undifferentiated tissues.  It is not at all likely in adults that are made up of cell lines that have become specialized (for the most part) and designed to simply replace worn out like-tissues.<br />Another consequence of the virus is a change in chromosome number in offspring.  The author doesn't go into how/why this occurs, but there is no new DNA added to the genome, so this must be the result of cleaving chromosomes into smaller pieces.  Would that change expression?  I wonder...<br />While that is a weakness, the story is still interesting and worth a fun vacation read this summer.  <br />Have a great day!<br />Alan Holyoak	2001-03-26

It starts out somewhat slowly, almost in fits and starts, but once you get past about page 75 it's a real page turner -- the character development picks up, and, one by one, the threads of the story start to come together.<br />So, what do a mummified Neanderthal family found in an ice cave, massacred villagers in Asian Georgia, and modern molecular biologists, virologists, and anthropologists have in common?  Read and find out!<br />As a biologist, I routinely read science based fiction, as well as non-fiction work, including books on interactions between evolution and development (e.g., &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; by Gould, &quot;The Shape of Life&quot; by Raff, &quot;Extinction&quot; by Raup, &quot;Shapes of Time&quot; by McNamara, etc.).  While my training made it possible for me to completely enjoy the possibilities offered in &quot;Darwin's Radio&quot;,  I can see how many non-scientists reading this book could become lost, confused, or put off by the frequent introduction and use of a wide variety of scientific theories and jargon (though I must admit that the author did a grand job of introducing scientific content without requiring the reader to jump directly into the deep end.)<br />I appreciated the author's delving into the politics, as well as the science, that often accompany situations like the one presented in this book.  So, how far should we push and support current paradigms?  That's a question that pops out of this book.<br />If you enjoyed books like &quot;Carriers&quot;, &quot;White Plague&quot;, or &quot;Hot Zone&quot;, then you will probably like this one too.<br />The only reason I did not award 5 stars for this book is that many readers may be put off by the mass of technical scientific information presented.  For me it was a definite 5-star offering, but probably 4 stars for the more general readership.<br />I hope these thoughts were helpful to you.<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College	2001-03-23

Slack does a grand job of telling his story...life and living as a researcher working on problems of development.  Slack has the ability to get you to grin as he talks about cow brains, growth factors, and other scientific adventures...&quot;Where are the brains, Dad?&quot;  (You'll have to read the book to know what that means.)  He also ably tells what it's like to be a scientist, as well as how one negotiates the politics and requirements of becoming successful as a research scientist.<br />The format of the book is interesting.  It includes several chapters that address what it's like (&quot;Ego&quot;) to be a research scientist, i.e., chapters 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10.  He defines what he calls &quot;good places,&quot; as well as who &quot;good people&quot; are in the scientific community.  If you are a budding scientist, these chapters contain nugget after nugget of wisdom and insight.  This book is worth the price for them alone.<br />The remaining chapters, 3, 5, 8 contain the essence of the research that Slack and his group do, thus the &quot;Egg&quot; portion of the book's title.  There is good information about the role of growth factors in development, and a broad brush review of the essentials of some of the processes of development and their molecular bases.<br />If you are up for a good read about life as a biologist, then come on along.  The only reason I didn't award this book 5-stars is that there would be a strong tendency for those not trained in the sciences to get lost in the technical aspects of the chapters on developmental processes.  For most biologists, however, especially for upper division undergraduate and graduate students, this book is a gem!<br />4 stars for the non-scientist, and 5 stars for the science crowd.<br />Kudos to Slack for this great little book (though he seems to take a rather dim view of places other than research universities -- we part ways there).  There is, I believe, too strong a sentiment among researchers (represented by some of Slack's opinions) that what non-researcher biologists do, i.e., teach, is not just different, it is &quot;less than.&quot;  It all comes down to what you choose to do for your own career, and how you define success for yourself.<br />I hope this review was helpful!<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College, IN	2001-03-15

It's not so thick that it's intimidating, but the contents cover the basics of evolutionary biology without being watered down.<br />The authors address topics of current interest (e.g., the evolution of HIV in Chapter 1) in drawing the student into the conversation about what evolution is, how it happens, and how you can demonstrate that it is happening.  <br />Major sections of the book include the following:<br />1) An introduction to evolution: the HIV story, evidence for evolution, natural selection...<br />2) Mechanisms of evolutionary change: mutation, genetic drift, genetics, etc...<br />3) Adaptation: sexual selection, kin selection, social behavior, life history factors...<br />4) The History of Life: mechanisms of speciation, reconstructing evolutionary trees, origins and evolution of life through human evolution...<br />5) Current Research in Evolutionary Biology: development and evolution (a field that's really gaining momentum these days), molecular evolution, evolution and human health...<br />The authors touch all the important bases in this introductory text on evolution.  The organization of material is logical, the tone is professional without being overbearing, there are many understandable examples, and the illustrations are excellent.  Because of those factors, this new book appears to be a great text to teach from.  There are wonderful reference texts out there about evolution, but most of them are not easy to teach or learn from.  This book, however, helps students to learn, and provides ample material for instructors to use.  <br />This is now my top choice for a textbook in evolution.  This book is definitely worth 5 stars!<br />I hope this review was helpful to you.<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College, IN	2001-03-01

Weaterford does a grand job of introducing a wide variety of topics that the Indians of the Americas have developed or contributed to the modern world.  As a reader you should we forewarned, however, that Weatherford has a tendency to occasionally push a discussion to the point of being overly biased.<br />Weatherford raises issues such as American Indians' contributions to the geopolitical influence of American silver and gold on the rest of the world...toward the end of that discussion it appears that the thread of connection between Indians' contributions and eventual impact of gold and silver is thin at best.  <br />There are extremely valuable discussions about the diversity and impact of food, medicinal, and other plants.  Those probably had a much larger impact on the rest of the world than did any of their other contributions.  Consider the impact of potatoes, corn, many species of beans, peanuts, and long-fiber cotton on the rest of the world.  I'm not sure that I agree with Weatherford on this...but he goes as far as to suggest that the Industrial Revolution of the late 19th century was driven by the importation of long-fiber cotton from the Americas to Europe.<br />Weatherford also discusses the contributions of Indians of the Americas to political philosophy, including the framing of the Constitution of the United States.  I believe there is some significance to that, but perhaps not as much as Weatherford suggests.<br />Regardless of those kinds of potential academic disagreements and the periodic forays into speculation by the author, &quot;Indian Givers&quot; remains a book well worth reading.<br />This would be a great book for anyone interested in the culture and history of the Indians of the Americas, or for those with interest in ethnobotany, the imact of the Indians of the Americas on the rest of the world, or the impact of the rest of the world on the Indians of the Americas (disease, conquests, etc. -- sad business, that!)<br />A good book, but a litte to speculative in some parts for me to award it 5 stars...definitely a strong 4 stars though.<br />I'm grateful for all the benefits I enjoy that came from the Indians of the Americas.<br />Alan Holyoak, Director of Environmental Studies, Manchester College, IN	2001-02-12

An outsider, a psychologist from UC Berkeley, is offered the chance to go there and learn about Santarogians and how they manage to keep themselves separate from everything else in the world.  With some reluctance and a great deal of hesitancy, our hero(?) enters the town and is greeted by some, including an old flame, with great enthusiasm.  Others are not so welcoming..in fact, did they try to kill him just then, or was that an accident?<br />In this chilling tale of consciousness-expanding food additives and crossed messages you will find yourself wondering about what IS going on in the book.  <br />This is a grand tale.  Too bad it's not in print, but sci-fi fans out there will benefit from the effort of rounding up a copy of their own to read.  <br />Though not in the same class as sci-fi classics such as &quot;Dune&quot; or &quot;Foundation&quot; this is a worthy tale...and if you don't watch out it may just give you nightmares...it did me once!  But I survived and finished the book...<br />Have fun and be careful out there...was that JUST an accident?<br />Alan Holyoak<br />P.S. Another great out-of-pring Frank Herbert classic -- even better than this one -- is &quot;White Plague&quot; give it a look!  It's worth 5 stars!	2001-01-24

I just finished &quot;Lucifer's Hammer,&quot; and, well, I'm impressed!  Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle have done a wonderful job in weaving a tale of excitement, fear, devastation, fear, desperation, and hope.  This is 5-star sci-fi all the way!<br />If all you read is the first 100 pages, however, you probably won't agree with that.  You see, the first part of the book is a bit slow in getting moving, but that's because the authors introduce a whole string of characters that interact with one another as the story and the action unfolds.  And once the action starts, it doesn't stop.  In fact, it makes you want to store some food, some water, some other things...and get ready for what COULD happen.<br />As I started reading this book I thought to myself, this book has many similarities with the movie &quot;Deep Impact.&quot;  Was I ever wrong with that assumption!  This book goes way beyond &quot;Deep Impact.&quot;  It goes beyond it in that this book is not so much about events surrounding a comet-earth collision as it is about the aftermath, and how people do or do not cope with that kind of calamity.<br />Imagine this...world-wide cataclysmic events wipe out the major governments on the planet -- national, state, and local governments collapse, and people are left to fend for themselves.  What will they do for food, shelter, personal safety, information, etc.?  It's a whole new ballgame out there!  The kinds of challenges described in the book bring out the best in some people, the worst in others, and trapped in the middle of everything that's happening are the characters you'll come to know quite well.    <br />The characters are, for the most part, believable, the plot development is rivetting, and the conclusion is satisfying.  <br />Do good guys always finish first?  Do they even survive?  Read &quot;Lucifer's Hammer&quot; and find out -- if you dare...<br />The authors really did their homework on this one.<br />5+ stars all the way for feasible, believable sci-fi.  <br />Good luck out there...<br />Alan Holyoak	2001-01-20

This book is also a great source of reference material for invertebrate biologists anywhere in the world.<br />This book includes information about methods, and hints about culturing and maintaining marine invertebrate larvae.  It also contains published or unpublished (but documented) observations on the reproduction and development of marine invertebrates of the northern Pacific coast.  <br />The book is divided into chapters devoted to different invertebrate phyla, including methods for culturing their larvae, as well as information on the timing of spawning and development of as many Pacific NW species as have been studied.  <br />The book, published in 1987, is now approaching its 15th year in publication.  Even though some parts of it are slowing slipping out of date, this book remains the best reference book on this topic.<br />Absolutely top notch reference material, 5-stars!<br />Alan Holyoak Dept of Biology Manchester College, IN	2001-01-16

The writing was passable, but readers should be forewarned that the author has a tendency to throw biological and scientific terms into the text, seemingly at random (in this book anyway).  Most of the technical jargon used by the author is so esoteric in nature that only professionals in the field of molecular biology or medical research are likely to know them (most of those terms are not even found in most dictionaries).  In many cases there is no explanation about what those terms mean.  As a biologist myself I caught the drift in most of those cases, but a reader not trained in the sciences will often be left scratching their head.<br />As for the characters and story, they are passable, and the story moves along at a good pace.  In that respect, this book IS a page turner.  The main characters include a college senior business major, his fiance, a student teacher, their best friend, a college senior headed to med school in the next fall, the head of a hospital ER unit, a molecular biologist, a physicist, a teen computer whiz-kid, an underground immunologist, and 1000s of small, smooth, black extraterrestrial &quot;coke bottle tops&quot; that are the source of anguish in the book.<br />The little objects &quot;sting&quot; humans and other living things, and change them biologically and psychologically.<br />Cook's &quot;Invasion&quot; struck me as a thinly veiled molecular biological version of the sci-fi classic movie, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&quot;  In that movie alien seed pods that mysteriously appear take over the minds and bodies of unassuming humans when they fall asleep.<br />While the book is a page turner and the characters are pretty believable, I was disappointed by the lack of originality in the basic story line, and the author's rampant, unexplained use of so many specialized terms.<br />There are some interesting plot twists, though some of them seem a little to convenient for my tastes.<br />All in all a good read if you're looking for some sci-fi escapism.  <br />A three star effort over all.<br />Watch out what you pick up out there, and if you don't, keep on grinning!<br />Alan Holyoak	2001-01-15

Like &quot;Dune: House Atreides&quot;, &quot;Dune: House Harkonnen&quot; is a treat for &quot;Dune&quot; fans, not so much because of the writing style or richness found in the Frank Herbert Dune books, but because this book provides interesting information about the roots of many of the characters in the Dune series and the interrelationships between them.  <br />As another reviewer aptly pointed out, do not read this book first.  If you want to start with a &quot;Dune: House&quot; book, start with House Atreides.  I strongly recommend, however, that if you are interested in reading in the Dune series that you start with &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert, then read the two prequels in order, they provide good background, but are not the 5-star material found in &quot;Dune.&quot;<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book (I have already read all of the other Dune books, including House Atreides), and think that other fans of Frank Herbert's Dune series will also enjoy it.<br />To Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's credit, they have been faithful to Frank Herbert's layered writing style, and have worked deliberately to maintain as much richness and depth in this book and its prequel as possible.  These are worthy additions to the Dune series, though they are a step down from the works by Dune's creator, Frank Herbert.<br />Things to look forward to in this book: - you learn more about the Tleliaxu and their axlotl tanks - you learn where Feyd Rautha comes from - you learn why Jessica decided to bear Duke Leto the gender of child she did - and more...<br />Enjoy the journey...<br />Alan Holyoak	2001-01-12

I picked up &quot;Dune: House Attreides&quot; as soon as I came across it, and read it in short order.  As a Frank Herbert fan in general, and a Dune series fan in specific, I relished the chance to re-enter the intricate world of Dune.  I was transported back to the worlds I'd gotten to know fairly well, and I enjoyed reading about the roots of House Attreides and House Harkonnen and their rivalry. As I read, however, I realized that if &quot;Dune: House Attreides&quot; were someone's first venture into the the Dune series, there would a a good chance that they would be greatly disappointed.<br />You see, this book is actually more of a foreward and detailed glossary to the rest of the Dune series than it is a prequel (even though the storyline is such that it does occur earlier, chronologically, than the rest of the Dune series).  The book provides interesting background about where some of the main players in the Dune series came from, and how they got to be where they are.<br />If you have already read the rest of the Dune series, or even just Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; you will enjoy this book.  If you are planning to cut your teeth on the Dune series by reading this book, you will be missing out on the richer tapestry, and the more intricate political and ecological machinations that Frank Herbert wove into his writing.<br />Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson do an admirable job in adding detail to the Dune world, but their's a step down from Frank's work.<br />I awarded this book 4 stars primarily because of the enjoyment that a seasoned Dune reader will gain from the additional background, while I readily admit that it would probably be a 3-3.5 star offering for someone who had never read a Frank Herbert Dune book.  <br />Still, I think that it's worth a read.  There are interesting plot developments, you learn more about the Fremen, and the story is told with a minimum of diversions into foul language, etc.<br />Good luck!<br />Alan Holyoak	2001-01-12

The character development, layered story-telling, and attention to detail make it an extremely interesting read.  I've read this book at least three times now, and I have enjoyed each reading as much as I did the first time through, nearly 15 years ago now.<br />Come along and join in the action as an unlikely hero, Jack Ryan get swept up by international politics and situations.<br />Definitely 5 stars.  <br />If you enjoy this book, there's a good chance that you'll also enjoy &quot;Red Storm Rising,&quot; &quot;Debt of Honor,&quot; and &quot;Executive Decision.&quot;  Those all take on action of global proportions!<br />Good luck out there!<br />Alan Holyoak	2000-11-20

Clancy uses a layered story-telling approach in his version of WWIII; Warsaw Pact and NATO forces face off in western Europe and in the Atlantic while the USSR makes a bold bid to solve an energy crisis precipitated by terrorists.<br />The story unfolds quickly, and the ride doesn't slow down until the last page of the book.  The reader is taken along for action on and under the Atlantic, on the ground in Iceland and the European mainland, and in the air, as Soviet and NATO military machines try to outfox and outfight each other.<br />This is story-telling on a global scale.  If you've never read a Tom Clancy novel this is a great one to try first.<br />If you're looking for a grand adventure, I highly recommend this book!<br />5 stars all the way!<br />If you like this Clancy book, you will probably also enjoy some of his others...&quot;The Hunt for Red October,&quot; &quot;Debt of Honor,&quot; and &quot;Executive Decision&quot; being the most likely candidates.<br />If you are more into political intruige I recommend that you try &quot;Patriot Games&quot; and &quot;Clear and Present Danger.&quot;  <br />Happy reading!<br />Alan Holyoak	2000-11-20

It presents an excellent overview of the life one commonly  finds along the Atlantic coast of the USA.  The book is arranged  taxonomically, and each entry contains a description of characters useful  in determining what you are looking at.  As a professional biologist, I  find this book to be superior in many ways to the Audubon Guides.  For  example, this Peterson guide includes both common AND scientific names by  each entry, the book is arranged taxonomically rather than by other less  important characters like color, etc.<br />This book is not, however, what  many casual naturalists are looking for in a field guide.  They often look  for a book filled by page after page of photographs or illustrations.  This  book is filled by page after page of information more useful to the more  advanced amateur or to the professional.  There are several illustrations,  many are simple line drawings that show details of important  characteristics used to tell one kind of organism from another.<br />All in  all a great field guide for the advanced amateur and professional.  This is  not, however, a book that is as likely to be embraced by the casual  observer.<br />5 stars for the more professional audience, but 4 stars for the  casual observer.<br />You might be happiest doing what another reviewer  suggested... to use this book along with a photo field guide such as an  Audubon Field guide to the region.<br />Happy splashing!<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept  of Biology, Manchester College, IN	2000-09-19

It is not, however, all that useful in doing taxonomic work, but it is a  great tool for use in supporting laboratory work involving general  identification of plankton.  In order to do more specific taxonomic work,  however, one needs access to more comprehensive taxonomic keys from the  professional literature.<br />Still, this book would be a great addition to  the library of any serious student of invertebrate zoology, marine biology,  or oceanography.<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College, IN	2000-09-19

Genetics and natural selection typically take front stage in discussions  of evolution.  Such has been the case for a long time, and may be for some  time to come.  BUT in &quot;Shapes of Time,&quot; McNamara makes a strong  case for including growth development in the mix in deciding how, why, and  when organisms came to be the way they are (or were).  <br />McNamara's main  thesis is that three major developmental trends -- 1) Peramorphosis; 2)  Paedomorphosis; and 3) Hypermorphosis (a twist on Peramorphosis) -- produce  a good deal of the observable variability out there.  He proceeds to make  the case that changes in rates of development and growth (i.e.,  heterochrony) can have a major impact as an evolutionary process, and that  heterochrony deserves a more prominent place in evolutionary theory.<br />Just  so you know what he's talking about...1) peramorphosis is a condition where  growth or development proceeds beyond that observed in the ancestral  condition; 2) paedomorphosis is a condition where development does not  reach the state observed in the ancestral condition; and 3) hypermorphosis  (a form of peramorphosis) is a condition where not only does growth and  development surpass the ancestral condition, but growth and development  proceeds longer than in the ancestral condition.<br />McNamara does an  excellent job of tying together his thesis in the last chapter by applying  virtually everything he talked about throughout the book.  In that chapter  he addresses human evolution, and does a great job of showing how, in terms  of heterochrony, we are a &quot;cocktail organism,&quot; showing signs of  paedomorphosis here, perimorphosis there, and hypermorphosis in another  situation.<br />Readers entrenched in the traditional view of the &quot;new  synthesis,&quot; i.e., genetics + natural selection = evolution, will find  themselves shaking their heads here and there as they read this book (I  even did that a couple of times and I'm a relatively strongproponent of  development being a significant factor in evolution).  If you press on you  will find that McNamara makes a sensible, supported case for the importance  of heterochrony as being an important factor in evolutionary theory.<br />The  question I have is this: &quot;What is the source of heterochrony in  development?&quot;  McNamara doesn't address this directly, but his  downplaying the role of genetics suggests that genetic variability codes  primarily for what happens, not when or how fast it happens.  This is a  quandry!  What controls and passes on information about the timing of  development and growth if not genetics?  In any case heterochrony exists in  growth and development.  That is not debatable.  <br />I support McNamara's  position that growth and development play a major role in evolution.  I  wonder what it will take to get those factors included in mainstream  discussions on evolutionary theory?  <br />Good job to Kenneth McNamara!  He  provides good food for thought in this offering.<br />5 stars.<br />Alan Holyoak,  Dept of Biology, Manchester College, IN	2000-09-14
US	52532820	R2IXSX56QAS5OB	0394519140	142015284	The National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies	Books	4	159	160	N	N	Good field guide for the interested amateur...	This field guide has significant strengths and weaknesses.  First, the  strengths.  This book provides what most casual butterfly enthusiasts want,  page after page of photos of butterflies (several hundred photos as a  matter of fact).  The photographs are good, for the most part, showing  differences and similarities between many butterflies included in the book.   (Most taxonomic characters are not readily seen in photos though.)  One  particularly helpful feature is that for many butterflies, such as skippers  and those bearing eye-spots, both the upper and underside of wings are  shown.  <br />The butterflies are arranged, for the most part, by wing  coloration or shape.  This can help with more rapid field identification.   There is also a section in the back of the guide that provides more  information on butterflies listed.<br />The book is a convenient size, readily  able to fit into a jacket or back pocket.  <br />OK, now for the weaknesses.   <br />As with other field guides published by the Audubon Soc...I can't figure  out why the editors didn't include the scientific names along with the  common names by each photo.  If you want to use this book for any kind of  taxonomic work, it becomes an annoying exercise in page flipping from the  front to the back of the book.  More serious entomologists will, of course,  use taxonomic keys to identify specimens, but for the amateur collector who  may not have or know how to use such keys, the format of the book can be  frustrating.<br />There are too few photos of caterpillars, chrysalises, etc.  at the front of the book.  I know of no field guide that provides much on  early life stages, and this guide is no different.  Don't get me wrong, I'm  pleased that they included a section on caterpillars, I just wish there  were more.  <br />There is very little information on the kinds of  characteristics usually used in butterfly taxonomy...antenna type, wing  veination, etc...presented in the book.  A significant weakness.<br />Even  with the large number of photographs, a photo cannot, in my opinion, do the  same job of a well-done illustration in helping someone identify what they  are looking at.  As photo-based guides on butterflies, this is probably one  of the best out there.  Still, I wish there were a good general guide based  on illustrations.<br />With that said, it is important to realize that no  single field guide can ever hope to be comprehensive in treating the  butterflies.  There are simply too many species and variations out there to  make a portable field guide.  <br />With all that said, I think that this is a  good, useful guide, but with a few changes it could be even better.  <br />4  stars.<br />Happy butterfly spotting!<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology,  Manchester College, IN	2000-09-14

This is a wonderful little illustrated book that can help parents share information about sex and where babies come from with their children.  I  especially like the fact that this book is presented from the point of view  of that sex is an expression of love, rather than just a presentation of  physical facts and the mechanics of sex.  <br />Information in the book is  presented in a straightforward manner with &quot;no nonsense and with  illustrations.&quot;  As for the illustrations, my wife told me that they  also helped her feel better about her own body!  How's that for a double  benefit?<br />I appreciate the level of the presentation as well...pitched  toward younger children...say, ages 7-10.  Children really need good,  accurate information from their folks, especially as they are surrounded by  various bits and pieces of partial and even mis-information about sex which  they hear from peers at school and other places.<br />The author uses  terminology that is appropriate and understandable.  A great little book.   <br />While this is a great little book, I recommend using it in combination  with another book, &quot;How to Talk to Your Child About Sex&quot; by Linda  and Richard Eyre, as part of a combined effort of discussion and reading as  you teach your child about sex.<br />Good luck!  <br />Alan Holyoak	2000-09-10

Contents of the book  include the following:<br />1) The Cambrian explosion -- this section provides  a brief introduction to the &quot;explosion&quot; of shelled animal fossils  in Cambrian rock formations, following the Precambrian rocks that lack such  fossils, and leaves off talking a bit about the Ediacaran fauna -- a fauna  that is found in Precambrian rock strata.<br />2) Aliens here on earth? --  this section deals with the issue of trace fossils vs body fossils, and  continues discussing the relevance and significance of the Ediacaran fauna  as evidence of Precambrian (animal?) life.  The authors also provide a  helpful overview of Ediacaran fauna including photos and illustrations of  them.<br />3) The mudeaters -- this section deals with psuedofossils  (apparently disturbances in ancient mud/sediment layers),  misidentifications of those as being fossils when they are not, etc.  The  authors then go on to discuss possibilities of animal life that were real  makers or Precambrian trace fossils.<br />4) Small shelly fossils -- this  section presents ideas about the earliest assemblages of shelly fossils at  the Precambrian - Cambrian boundary, including the &quot;Tommotian  fauna.&quot;  <br />5) The golden spike -- this section addresses the process  and uncertainty of identifying a definitive boundary marker that hails the  beginning of the Cambrian era.  (This is no small issue, and the beginning  time mark of this era has shifted farther and farther back in time as we  learn more about the history of life.)<br />6) Rifting of Rodinia -- this  section addresses the possibility that the emergence of animal life may  well have been associated with a period of glaciation, as well as other  pieces of evidence that help to unravel the sticky problem of describing  the emergence of metazoan animal life.<br />7) The garden of Ediacara -- thissection addresses trophic strategies for acquiring energy and nutrients  anomg early animal life on earth.<br />8) Ecological feedback and intelligence  -- this section addresses the effects of feedback mechanisms on the  emergence of life.  For example, the emergence of grazing herbivores led to  the demise of previously ungrazed stromatolite beds...nothing had eaten  them before.  That consequently opened up more open space on the substrate,  and in ecological and evolutionary space for other kinds of autotrophs to  gain a toe-hold in new community structures.  This section also addressed  the significance of symmetrical animals bearing eyes and better developed  nervous systems than ever before.<br />9) Precambrian oxygen -- this section  provides an overview of the development of an atmosphere on earth that is  suitable for sustaining animals that rely on respiration.  By the Cambrian,  the atmosphere attained an O2 level of about 2%...apparently a critical  level needed to sustain respiring life.<br />10) Ecological chaos and  innovation -- this section addresses ideas about the nature of the  emergence of life on earth...was it a gradual or a fast process of  emergence...as the authors put it, &quot;did the Cambrian come in with a  whimper or a bang?&quot;  In either case, the consequence of an apparent  age of chaotic ecological activities, extinctions and emergences of many  kinds of animals (and presumably other forms of life, too) led to a fossil  record that includes evidence of rapid and wide-spread innovation.  Thus,  the emergence of animal life that gave rise to the kinds of animal  diversity we have today.<br />Though now 10 years old, this is still a good  book.  Evolutionary biologists and paleontologists will nod in agreement at  some points, shake their fists at others.  But, all in all, this is an  excellent book if you are interested in ideas and information describing  possible scenarios about the emergence of life on earth.  There are goodphotos and abundant illustrations that help the reader see and start to  understand the forms of animals being discussed.<br />Give it a look.  <br />5  stars for the informed lay-naturalist as well as for the professional  biologist/paleontologist!<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester  College, IN	2000-09-07

Rudwick chose the title &quot;The Meaning of Fossils: Episodes in the  History of Palaeontology&quot; for his book, but I think that a subtitle  more descriptive of the contents would be something like &quot;Essays on  the History of Palaeontology.&quot;  A subtle difference, perhaps, but  meaningful, since in many respects this book is about the people behind the  fossils as much as it is about fossils themselves. <br />The book includes the  following contents:<br />1) Fossil objects -- this section presents ideas  about what people thought fossils were before they realized they were  related in any way to once-living things.  It also includes early work on  fossils, their descriptions, the light bulb going on about where fossils  really come from, and related topics.<br />2) Natural antiquities -- this  section presents an example describing how we came to the realization that  fossils really are parts and pieces of things that were one alive -- all  from study of fossil and living sharks' teeth.  This section also describes  alternative explanations (from antiquity) that explain where fossils came  from...interesting stuff.<br />3) Life's revolutions -- this section describes  Cuvier's work and evidence he presented that showed that there is, in fact,  a process of extinction that operates on earth.  This thought, that a kind  of living thing (a species), that was once alive are all now dead was a  revolutionary thought!  This section also introduces the notion of geologic  time...deep time, of a length not realized or considered before...another  revolution in thought.<br />4) Uniformity and progress -- this section  includes a description of Lyell's new view of geology and geologic  processes, that an ongoing gradual process of small magnitude can, over  long periods of time produce all observable geological features.  That idea  fed into the new ideas being applied to fossils, the appearance and  disappearance of fossil species.  <br />5) Life's ancestry -- this section  discusses the importance of actually looking and seeing for one's self, as  Heinrich-Georg Bronn's work did by &quot;Being taught by nature (Natura  doceri).&quot;  There is also a discussion of what &quot;species&quot;  means, and how that plays into the whole idea of fossil and extinct things  as described by the evolutionary theories of Wallace and Darwin.<br />This is  a good book with good examples.  It provides an excellent historical  perspective on the development of thinking relative to palaeontology.  This  book should be read by every student of palaeontology, and by most biology  students as well!<br />Great stuff!<br />5 stars all the way (though the title  could use a little work).<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester  College, IN	2000-09-07

All students at Manchester College, IN, (where I teach) are expected to  own and use a copy of this extremely helpful, user friendly reference guide  to writing.  The spiral bound format of the book is outstanding, since  someone can have it open as they type, or jot down notes, or thoughts.   <br />The book is organized into three major sections: 1) Composition/Style,  2) Correctness, and 3) Format/Basic grammar.  Each of those major sections  are subdivided into four supporting subsections as  follows:<br />Composition/Style -- 1) Composing and revising, 2) Research  writing, 3) Effective sentences, and 4) Word Choice.<br />Correctness -- 1)  Grammatical sentences, 2) ESL Trouble spots, 3) Punctuation, and 4)  Spelling and mechanics.<br />Format/Basic Grammar -- 1) Document design, 2)  MLA documentation, 3) Alternative styles of documentation, and 4) Basic  grammar.<br />In addition to those sections, there are tutorials at the front  of the book that helps the user get the best benefit from support available  in the book.  There are also ESL hints throughout the text, not just in the  section dedicated to ESL challenges.  The index is helpful, there are  several URLs at the back of the book where a writer can go for more help,  and there is even a page that shows revision symbols.  <br />There are ample  examples throughout, and anyone who conscientiously applies the lessons in  this book will become a better writer.<br />This is a top-flight book with  great things to offer everyone -- from struggling first-year college  students taking their first composition class to the polished professional  writer.<br />The strengths of this text made this book the top choice to  support our writing across the curriculum program at Manchester College.

In the natural course of  events the little boy either brings home or asks his mother if he can bring  home animal after animal for a pet.  Thus the book's title, &quot;Can I  Keep Him?&quot;  His mother's responses are typical, but the translation of  her responses in her son's head (shown in picures also done by Kellogg) are  hilarious!<br />A definite hit with children and adults alike!<br />Give it a  try.  <br />Definitely 5 stars.<br />Alan Holyoak	2000-09-06

Larry Gonick and Mark Wheelis have put together a wonderfully entertaining  and relatively painless introduction to the field of genetics.

The book contains information on the basics of genetic theory, the  people behind the theory, Mendelian genetics, and molecular genetics (e.g.,  what DNA is, how it copies itself, and how the information it carries codes  for protein synthesis).<br />I actually have a colleague who has used this  book to supplement the main text he uses in his genetics  course.<br />Definitely a five star effort!<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology,  Manchester College, IN	2000-08-21

Bonner is a master developmental/evolutionary biologist who is best known for his work on the development and morphogenesis of a little known group of organisms called slime molds.  A wonderful group of organisms, by the  way.  In this book, however, Bonner takes on the task of explaining how  natural selection can produce increasingly complex systems of living  things.  A formidable challenge. <br />The book contains 8 chapters, as  follows:<br />1. A brief summary of Darwinian evolution, along with an  indication of the purpose of the book.<br />In this section Bonner addresses  issues such as time, what natural selection is, and the roles that factors  such as development, ecology, behavior, and genetics play in the processes  of evolution.  This chapter is a great primer on ideas regarding natural  selection. <br />2. Evidence for the evolution of size increase (and decrease)  from the fossil record.<br />In this chapter Bonner presents data from the  fossil record (which is unavoidably biased) that indicates how the size of  things have changed over time.  He makes a case that, generally speaking,  things have tended to get larger over time.<br />3. The size of organisms in  ecological communities.<br />Here is a good thought to consider while reading  this chapter...organisms of increased size are necessarily more  structurally complex than smaller organisms, but, complexity that allowed  increases in size to occur existed BEFORE those size increases took place  (e.g., mammals).  In this chapter Bonner considers topics such as relations  between the size and abundance of organisms, size and life histories, size  changes wtihin a species, and size in sexual selection.  A great chapter  full of thought provoking ideas!<br />4. A problem in developmental biology:  Why and how larger plants and animals are built.<br />In this chapter Bonner  addresses these topics: ways to become multicellular; selective forces for  multicellularity; development of support structures (thus allowing  increased size); proportions and size; developmental steps and size; and  the legacy (opportunities and constraints) of past developments.<br />5. The  relation between the complexity of communities and the size, diversity, and  abundance of the organisms within them.<br />This is the chapter that will  catch ecologists' eyes.  In this chapter Bonner discusses what complexity  is, relationships between diversity, abundance, and size, connections  between diversity and habitat, and the evolution of diversity.  Great  stuff!<br />6. How size affects the internal complexities of organisms in  their evolution and in their development.<br />This was my favorite chapter in  the book.  Since I have done a good chunk of research on clonal animals, I  was interested in reading Bonner's thoughts on clonal versus aclonal  animals (the first topic in this chapter).  He also addresses topcis such  as size and internal complexity, cell size and internal complexity, how  large complex organisms are built, plasticity in development, the evolution  of internal complexity, and related ideas.  This chapter will catch the  attention of developmental/evolutionary biologists.<br />7. Animal behavior:  The pinnacle of biological complexity.<br />In this chapter Bonner looks at  relationships between behavior and nervous systems, and natural selection  and behavior.<br />8. The evolution of complexity: A conclusion with three  insights.<br />Bonner concludes with three insights: 1) somatic versus genomic  complexity; 2) size-complexity connections; and 3) and connections between  integration and isolation.<br />Though this book is now 12 years old, it is  well worth the effort.  Bonner does a great job of making complex ideas  understandable, and he is able to bring the professional and advanced  amateur along for the ride.

The title of this book, &quot;Life: A natural history of four billion years of life on Earth,&quot; was a great selling point for me.  As an invertebrate zoologist I have an ongoing interest in learning more about  where life came from, how it is interrelated, and how and when the  diversity of life around us came into being.  Of course, no one has  definitive explanations for those kinds of topics, but I was looking  forward to reading Fortey's views on the natural history of life.  <br />As I  began reading I soon became disillusioned with Fortey's approach.  If he  wanted to write his autobiography, wedged in here and there among his main  topic, why in the world didn't he tip off the reader by having a better  subtitle?  I did press on and complete the book, and found it to have  meaningful content and thought-provoking ideas, but after all was said and  done I was left wanting.  <br />Fortey deserves commendation for undertaking  such a massive topic, in 322pp no less!  As I read through his account in  search of information that would provide me with a clue to the framework he  uses to understand the natural history of life on earth, I felt like I hit  speed bump after speed bump in the form of occasionally interesting, but  often meaningless, diversions.  I'm sorry, but I could really care less,  for example, what a hotel traditionally frequented by paleontologists  serves for breakfast, or Fortey's personal reflections on Australian ponds  where &quot;the jolly swagman rested his tuckerbag&quot;!  <br />Don't get me  wrong, those are wonderful literary side steps in this largely scientific  work, but for me they were only distractions rather than useful  contributions to the work.<br />Fortey does do a great job in some areas...for  example, he does a super job of tying together plate tectonics and  continent formations, break-ups, and movements as they affect the history  of life.  He also does a grand job of telling the basics of what kinds of  things onecan learn about life and the state of the earth from the fossil  and other geologic records.  But even so, there is too little meat here for  the scientist, and there is too little support in the form of graphs,  illustrations, etc., to allow most non-professionals to keep up with what's  happening.  That point is evidenced by the fact that Fortey introduces many  little-known, though important, animals by their scientific names, but  provides no supporting illustrations to let the reader know or confirm what  Fortey is talking about.<br />There are a few chapters that, in my opinion,  Fortey got &quot;right.&quot;  Those are the chapters he said that he was  loathe to write -- the chapters about dinosaurs.  Fortey did a masterful  job of describing this period of history, as well as the underlying major  controversies and players behind those controversies.  He did not  accomplish those things in most of the other sections of the book.<br />To sum  things up, Fortey did what a water color painter, Terry Madden, tells his  students to do -- that is, to use the largest brush you can manage.  Fortey  used a large brush supported by limited detail work here and there -- not  enough detail to make this book a must have for professionals, and too  little on the explanation side to make this an essential book for the  non-professional.  <br />If you are looking for a great book that provides a  synopsis on the natural history of life on earth, there are better  offerings.  If you are looking for autobiographical accounts of scientists  or works where the author likes to sidestep and let you in on his daydreams  and poetic reflections, this book may suffice for you.<br />It seems to me,  though, that Fortey failed to identify his audience, as well as his  ultimate goal in writing the book.  There are good parts, and  disappointments.<br />Failing to find the middle ground resulted in what was,  for me, only about a 3-star experience.<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology,  Manchester College, IN	2000-07-24

The nice thing about birds and birding is that there are few enough  species out there that you can get virtually all of them in one regional  guide. <br />This book is outstanding. It relies on illustrations rather than  photographs to show markings and other details used to ID birds in the  field. I find that photos are often sub-standard, not showing characters  essential for identifying birds due to the position of the bird, markings  of the individual chosen for inclusion in the book, etc.<br />In this book  each entry includes a bird's common and scientific names, a brief physical  description of the body and coloration, a drawing(s) of the bird, a brief  description of habitats where they are likely to be seen, a blip about  their      geographic distribution, notes on their song, and reference to  similar species (if any). The entry also refers the reader to a map number  that shows the summer and winter ranges for each bird. <br />This is &quot;the  bird book&quot; to have for birds that live east of the Rockies for the  novice and experienced birder alike. If you've never had much luck figuring  out which birds you are looking at try this book. <br />5 stars all the way!   <br />Note: if you travel much throughout the USA, you ought to pick up the  Peterson Guide to Western Birds as well -- it is the sister book to this  one. With both of those books in hand you will be in good birding  shape.<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College, IN	2000-07-07

It is, however, an entertaining and informative (and self-illustrated) collection of memories, thoughts, and events from the  life of one of the men who was instrumental to the current success of the  Disney Corp.  <br />Bill Peet tells of his boyhood, his constant doodling and  drawing, and how he joined Disney during the depression as a finish  cartoonist.  Peet's imagination and drive to express his ideas led him to  become one of the people Disney relied on to create and deliver the kind of  animated work that now have masterpiece status.  His name is found on many  of Disney's successful animation features (e.g., Peter Pan, Sword in the  Stone, Fox and the Hound, etc.).  <br />Peet eventually left Disney and went  on to find success as an author and illustrator.  If you are like me, you  will enjoy reading his candid comments about life and making a living as an  artist, and about his association with and perspectives of Walt Disney, the  man.<br />Bill Peet's books are favorites of the children at our house.   <br />This is a delightful read.  Give it a try!  I'm glad I did.<br />5  stars.<br />Alan Holyoak	2000-07-07

While science is my area of expertise, I have a continuing interest in history.  That interest lead me to pick up Prange's book.  Gordon Prange has devoted years to accumulating information about the Japanese attack on  Pearl Harbor.  That information includes interviews and military and  government information from the USA and Japan.  That accumulated  information was then boiled down into this final work -- completed after  Prange's death.<br />While there have been many books and theories proposed  about why and how the debacle at Pearl Harbor took place, Prange's approach  is well documented, and includes details of the pre-attack politics of the  USA and of Japan.  His book also includes detailed information about the  attack itself, gleaned from interviews with those on both sides who  actually participated in the event.  But, even with that level of detail, I  must admit that the most compelling part of the book for me is the section  that follows the actual attack -- when the US government and the military  were trying to figure out what actually happened, and who was to  blame.<br />The final series of chapters of the book provide insight into the  thoughts and tactics of Adm. Kimmell (CincPAC) and Gen Short (Commanding  General of army at Hawaii), the two primary &quot;interested parties&quot;  in the event.  <br />Before reading the book, I had a tendency to believe that  there may have been something of a conspiracy by the Roosevelt  administration to get us into WWII, but after reading this account of Pearl  Harbor, I am more likely to believe that the great success, including  complete surprise by Japanese naval aviation was the result of a series of  ill-advised decisions by the commanders at Hawaii rather than by any entity  in Wash DC.  <br />The sticky point in the whole affair was &quot;magic&quot;  the US's code-breaking machine that allowed us to monitor coded diplomatic  messages sent between Tokyo and some of its embassies.  While  &quot;magic&quot; was the source of a great deal of information that may  have resulted in a different outcome at Pearl Harbor if the commanders  there had access to it, we will never really know.<br />If you are interested  in looking in repurcussions from the attack at Pearl Harbor, or if you have  an interest in thinking about the whys and hows of the US entry into WWII,  I urge you to read this book.<br />The writing is passable, though sometimes  quite dry.  The information is well documented, and is believable.  This is  not, however, a quick read -- there is a lot of meat in this book to be  digested as you go along.<br />All in all an outstanding contribution to the  telling of a sensitive piece of American history.<br />5 stars for content and  believability.<br />Alan Holyoak	2000-07-07

As Director of Environmental Studies I regularly recommend this book to  students who come to see me about environment-related career possibilities.  <br />The book is divided into 4 parts:<br />1) Job hunting in the environmental  field.  In this section readers are given hints about education, using  volunteer and internship opportunities, and ways to break into the  environmental job market.<br />2) Planners and communicators. In this section  readers are provided info about jobs related to these two areas, including  environmental education.<br />3) Environmental protection. In this section  information about industries such as solid waste management, hazardous  waste mgt, air quality mgt, and water quality mgt are outlined.  There are  opportunties in both private and public sectors for people trained in these  areas.<br />4) Natural resource management. This section describes the kinds  of jobs most people tend to think of for someone trained in the  environmental sciences: land and water conservation; fisheries; wildlife  mgt; park maintenance and mgt; outdoor recreation; and forestry.<br />All in  all, this book provides a nice introduction to environmental careers.  I  know that students of mine have used this book to look for job directions,  and to show their parents that choosing a major in environmental studies  can lead to a wide range of viable career options.<br />Probably the best  overview book on the market.<br />5 stars.<br />Alan Holyoak, Director of  Environmental Studies, Manchester College, IN	2000-07-07

That's nice.  This guide also includes  most of the birds of the region.  Those are the plusses of this book.   There are, however, a number of minuses that come along with this book.   <br />First of all, no photograph-based field guide can show the important  characteristics needed to identify most birds as clearly as a good  illustration can.  Next, the only info that accompanies each photograph is  the common name of the bird, along with its gender, average size, and a  reference to a page number to a section in the back of the book that  provides all of the descriptive narrative information for each species.   That info includes each bird's physical description, voice (call), habitat,  nesting info, and geographic range (with a map by the info -- that's nice).   The part that's frustrating for me is that I have to spend time flipping  back and forth between the photo section at the front of the book and the  info section at the back of the book in order to get the info I'm looking  for! While I'm in the field birding, that's a hassle!  I therefore much  prefer the illustrated format that has pictures and descriptive info of the  Peterson Guides to the Audubon guides.<br />Still, the Audubon guides are  useful, though I use mine primarily as a secondary source, and it usually  stays inside when I go out -- Peterson is my guide of choice.<br />I am, by  the way, a novice birder myself, and find that the Peterson Guides help me  to ID birds faster and with fewer errors than the Audubon guides do.<br />5  points for photos, but 3 points for ease of use, for 4 points  overall.<br />Good luck,and happy spotting!<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology,  Manchester College, IN	2000-07-07

The book contains just over 700 photographs of insects and spiders in the front section of the book divided into 22  more or less taxonomic divisions.  There is section of descriptive  information nearly 600 pages long in the back of the book.  The format of  the book is such that it can fit into a back pocket or jacket pocket  without a lot of bother.<br />The reference material is helpful in identifying  insects/spiders, but I have one significant criticism about the book...why  in the world didn't the editors include the scientific names along with the  common names of these animals by the photographs in the front section?  If  one wants to use this book as an aid in scientific identification it  becomes an exercise in page flipping -- though those engaged in serious  taxonomic identification will doubtless use taxonomic keys for that  purpose.  Still, for the advanced amateur collector, the page flipping can  get annoying.<br />The photographs are of generally good quality, though no  photograph is the equal of a quality illustration.  <br />While 700 photos  sounds like a lot, that number is nowhere near the number of photographs it  would take to do a comprehensive field guide to insects and spiders of  North America.  Still, this guide provides good introduction to the  diversity of North American insects and spiders.  This book will get you in  the ballpark when you try to identifying these animals, but you'll have to  use other reference materials if you are serious about taxonomy.<br />A  helpful book, though it has a few flaws.  You might consider using this  book and the Peterson Field Guide to Insects together -- the latter book  relies on illustations, and it includes a form of taxonomic keys that are  not that hard to use.<br />4 stars -- well worth the price.<br />Alan Holyoak,  Dept of Biology, Manchester College (IN)	2000-06-30
US	52532820	R1CAON671CVW7R	0395074363	657736679	Field Guide to the Insects of America North of Mexico (Peterson Field Guide )	Books	4	206	208	N	N	Tougher to use for the casual amateur, but a good book!	Most amateur naturalists tend to expect page after page of photographs or drawings when they purchase a field guide.  That is not what you will get in this book.  <br />The authors, Borrer and White, have developed a sort of  mini-entomology book for use in the field.  The first part of the book  contains helpful hints and instructions on how to collect and preserve  insects.  That section is followed by about 15 pages on the biology and  taxonomy of this huge group.  Understanding this information is essential  if one is put together a useful insect collection.  It also helps the  insect watcher better understand what they are seeing in the ecology and  body plans of these animals.  Those sections are followed by over 300 pages  of information that will help the determined insect watcher/collecter  figure out the kind of animal they are looking at.  <br />You should be  advised that this book will NOT help you identify insects to the level of  genus and species.  The taxonomic information in this book targets  primarily the family level (the level above the genus level).<br />Some  reviewers have commented that the lack of color illustrations renders this  book nearly useless.  You need to understand that, for the serious  collector, there are characteristics much more important in figuring out  what they are looking at than color.  The book is loaded with the kinds of  information used by professional entomologists to identify the animals they  study.<br />You should also be reminded that there are thousands of insect  species, and many regional variations of those species, so no single field  guide could ever hope to provide a comprehensive treatment of the  group.<br />If you want/need a bounty of color photos to supplement your  study, I recommend that you use this book along with a field guide like  those available from the Audubon Society (E.g., The Audubon Society Field  Guide to North American Insects and Spiders, which has over 700 photos of  these animals).<br />The Peterson guide relies on illustrations rather than  photos (illustrations are, I believe, far superior to photographs for  identification work).  There are both color and B/W illustrations in the  book.  There are also many helpful line drawings of body parts important to  helping you ID insects.<br />I give this book 4 stars only because it tends to  be a bit tougher for the casual amateur to use, but recommend it highly for  the advanced amateur, as well as for general reference for the  professional.<br />Well worth the price -- but not a child's book.<br />Good  luck!<br />Alan Holyoak, Dept of Biology, Manchester College	2000-06-30

When compared with today's similar action adventures by authors such as Tom  Clancy, however, Maclean's come up only slightly second best.<br />Even with  that being the case, Maclean's books, and WHERE EAGLES DARE in particular  are worth a look.<br />In this book, set during WWII not long before D-Day, an  American general who is one of the chief planners for D-Day is shot down  over Germany.  British intelligence decides to send in a top-flight group  of agents to try to rescue him from an impregnable castle fortress in  Bavaria.  The leader of the group, Smith, is accompanied by 5 other British  agents and an American, Shaffer (not to mention a woman who is part of the  endeavor, known only to Smith).<br />Smith is completely British, including  his humor, while Shaffer is completely American -- including American  humor.  <br />This is a fast read, at only a little over 200 pp., quite a bit  shorter than the 400+ pages of Clancy's works.  The dialogue is good, the  plot development and its twists and turns are great.  There is not a lot of  depth of character development, just enough to carry the story, but the  action and suspense make up for it.<br />As you probably know, this book was  made into a movie starring Richard Burton as Smith, and Clint Eastwood as  Shaffer.  The movie is quite faithful to the book, including dialogue  directly from the novel.  They kill fewer people in the novel than in the  book -- Shaffer and Smith both come across as being more gentle, still  cold-blooded, but gentle, than in the movie.<br />Keep an eye out for  Shaffer's falling for Heidi -- something that doesn't happen in the  movie.<br />It's a good, fun, summer read.<br />4 stars.<br />Be careful out  there!<br />Alan Holyoak	2000-06-28

The most famous of his characters is, or course, Tarzan.  And this book is the one that got the Tarzan legacy started.  <br />In this book you meet  Tarzan, learn who he really is, where he came from, how he became lord of  the apes and protector of the jungle, and the English Earl of Greystoke.   You also learn the story behind the story about Tarzan and Jane.  <br />I've  been a Tarzan fan for nearly 20 years.  I've been collecting Tarzan books  (older ones) for the past 15 years.  I've read nearly all the books in the  series, and this one is probably the best.  I'll be the first to admit that  if you read a lot of Tarzan books back to back you will see a somewhat  formulaic approach to some of the installments.  This first book, however,  is original, interesting, and immensely entertaining.<br />I encourage you to  read the book that got it all started in 1914 -- the premis, the character,  and the mystique that spawned numerous films, and other spin-off media, and  a series of books that spanned publication dates from 1914 well into the  1940s.<br />Move over Indiana Jones and James Bond -- Tarzan is the real  McCoy.  He's strong, brave, modest, wise, and good.  He's got the  attributes that we could sure use in a hero today!  <br />Give this book a  look.  You'll be glad you did.  It's a book that you could enjoy reading to  your children.<br />5 stars for story, character development, readability, and  content.  Is it a literary classic?  Yes, in that it holds its own  respected place among fictional literature.  Will it ever will literary  acclaim?  I don't think that Joyce or Faulkner need to worry.<br />But, hey,  it's a fun read!

Norton presents a review of moral, economic, and philosophical rationales for preserving natural variety, i.e., biological diversity and the habitats that support it.<br />This is not a &quot;bleeding heart&quot; tree-huggers  guide to preserving nature.  It is, on the other hand, an academically  sound presentation of ideas and rationales that can help one understand  that the discussion of the value of, say, a tree goes much  further than  the amount of money one could obtain by cutting it down and selling it for  lumber or pulp.<br />The book focuses on definitions and examples of different  methods of applying value systems to diversity.  After all, in this world  there is little hope of preserving a thing when its value cannot be  identified.  <br />Three main value systems are discussed in the book: <br />1)  Demand value (the economic or market value of a thing or access to a  thing)<br />2) Intrinsic value (the value of the existance of a thing,  regardless of its market value -- i.e., the value of a thing because  &quot;it is&quot;<br />3) Transformative value (the likelihood that contact  with a thing will change the way humans view that thing and other entities  in nature)<br />Norton uses those value systems to present ideas about why  natural diversity ought to be preserved.  <br />This book is, in my opinion, a  must read for anyone who teaches about the environment.  It should also be  read by legislators, and, to tell the truth, it wouldn't hurt many  environmentalists to read it either!<br />A highly recommended book.  5  stars!<br />Alan Holyoak, Director of Environmental Studies	2000-05-23

Gould sets up a premis in this overview and discussion of animals represented in the fossils of the Burgess shale that makes for interesting reading and thinking.  The author uses the same premis of the Frank Capra  classic, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; starring Jimmy Stewart.  <br />What  would life be like if one of the players had never existed?  ...like poor  old George Bailey who thought everyone would be happier and better off  without him.<br />In this book Gould takes the position that animals that  exist today do so primarily because they were lucky during their early  evolutionary history, along with having characteristics that allowed them  to survive and succeed in their environment long enough to reproduce -- a  contingency hypothesis.  They turned right instead of left and consequently  avoided predation...OR...they turned left instead of right, were eaten, and  that was the end of an entire ancestral line.  <br />This book is a must read  for anyone interested in ideas surrounding the diversity of early animal  life.  The book provides an informative overview of what evolution is, how  the now famous Burgess shale fossil beds were discovered and studied, and  why some of the body plans found amongst the Burgess shale fauna are not  found today.  There are also excellent drawings of Burgess shale fossils  and the animals they may once have been, and a reasonable selection of  descriptions of their possible behaviors based on animal form and  function.<br />Gould also recounts ideas others have had about the Burgess  shale fauna and its contribution to our understanding of the Cambrian fauna  in general.<br />It's interesting to note that this book was written prior to  the discovery of several other Burgess shale-type fossil beds around the  world, most notably in China. But, given what Gould had to work with at the  time, this is an admirable work.<br />If this general topic interests you, you  may want to take a look at another book -- &quot;TheCrucible of  Creation&quot; by Simon Conway Morris.  Morris' book provides addtional  excellent graphic presentations of cambrian fauna, a different explanation  of some possible paleo-ecologies of those animals, and a fundamentally  different read on why we have the kinds of animals that we have today.   Morris also includes information about newly discovered Burgess shale-like  fossil beds and specimens.<br />All in all, Gould's book is a 5-star work.   I'd recommend reading it AND Morris' book for a balanced set of different  opinions about this important animal group.	2000-05-22

And the author does it all in less than 200 pp.<br />The only  downside I can see to this book is that it's kind of pricy for a relatively  slim paperback.  <br />Still, I give this book 5 stars for general coverage  and retaining its focus.<br />Alan Holyoak, Director of Environmetal Studies,  Manchester College, IN	2000-05-22

I tore into it ravenously (being a Benchley fan from &quot;Jaws&quot; days), and found myself shaking my head at the unbelievable expectations the author  wanted me to believe as the story-line unfolds.  To me the whole book read  like a great white shark meets a storm trooping Edward Scissorhands or,  maybe, Freddie Kruegger.<br />First of all, the author appears to be reaching  deep for any kind of sympathy or group you can hope to pull into a story --  Nazis and those who hate them, reporters and those who hate them, even  sharks.  Sharks are, by the way, only peripheral characters in this book,  maligned and mauled by the main creature/character.<br />OK, I usually don't  tell too much about what's in a book, but I want to save many of you who  haven't read this book already.  A deranged Nazi scientist develops an  amphibious biological based on a human form (an ultimate amphibious  warrior) that has metal teeth and claws, a ravenous appetite, and nasty  disposition to match.<br />No one in the book knows what to make of the  remains they find scattered along the beach and, later, on shore.  Only at  the end of a predictable series of events do the &quot;good guys&quot;  finally figure out what's up and put and end to the situation.<br />I worked  my way through the book in good order, mostly because I was on vacation at  the time and had little else at hand to read.  The book is a quick and,  compared to JAWS, a shallow read.  <br />I wish I could recommend this book,  but I cannot in good conscience do that.  I can't imagine who in the world  I would feel good recommending it to.  It's too bad that not everything out  there is a 5-star item.<br />I gave it a couple of stars primarily because I  enjoy stories with a marne setting.<br />I hope these comments are helpful to  you.<br />Alan Holyoak	2000-05-22

There are suffient numbers of statistical tests in the  text to cover most of my statistical needs.  The book also includes its own  tables of critical values (something that BIOMETRY does not -- there's a  paperback companion book of tables for that book).   Zar also includes  examples that are easy to follow, as well as enough mathematical background  to allow one to understand the hypothetical and much of the mathematics  behind the statistical methods.<br />I typically turn to Zar first when I have  a statistical question.  This book continues to be a highly prized ally of  mine in the data analysis game.  <br />I highly recommend this book to all  biology grad students and researchers.  It's well worth the price -- an  investment that pays off!<br />5 stars, no doubt about it.	2000-05-22

Fed up with the endless violence and loss of innocent life due to  chronic IRA-British conflicts in Ireland, the scientist uses methods of  genetic engineering to develop a virus that he plans to release in Ireland.   He sends notice to the world of his intentions, and releases the  virus.<br />The virus kills only women.  Ireland is devastated, but, of  course, the virus escapes and the white plague becomes a pandemic. <br />The  technology certainly exists to develop genetically engineered viral vectors  (i.e., viruses that carry genetically engineered DNA or RNA).  Is such a  plague possible?  Technically, yes.  That's what makes the tale so  chilling.  <br />The spread of the disease in the book and efforts to protect  uninfected women are described as effort after effort to stop the virus  fail.  <br />This is great summer time reading for anyone who enjoys  techno-sci-fi books.  The story line is convincing, the scientific premises  of the book are within the reach of feasibility, and the potential  consequences of such an act are mind boggling.<br />Please re-issue this book.   There are certainly people out there who would enjoy it.<br />5 stars!<br />Alan  Holyoak	2000-05-22

This true account of life behind the veil, i.e., life as a woman, as a member of the royal family in Saudi Arabia changed the way I think about several things.<br />This intruiging account, based on a woman's forbidden  journal that was smuggled out of Saudi Arabia, provides deep insights into  what it's like to be a woman in a world so dominated by men that it is  difficult for Americans to imagine.  <br />Imagine a culture where the birth  and death of a women, even royalty, are of so little consequence that those  events are reportedly not officially recorded.  At the same time, women in  the royal family have wealth and bounty difficult to imagine.  The book  describes how a family has homes in multiple places throughout the world,  all of them identical, with identical things in them -- cars, furniture,  clothing, toys, etc., so the family wouldn't feel displaced when they  travel.  That also makes it possible for them to travel without taking any  luggage!  Wow!<br />This book covers topics including Saudi family dynamics,  gender differences, entering womanhood, the effects of &quot;Desert  Shield&quot; and &quot;Desert Storm&quot; on Saudi culture, and, of course,  the all encompassing influence of Islam on the life of a woman.<br />I  heartily recommend this book.  It will open your eyes, and help you realize  that money certainly isn't everything.<br />5 stars for an intruiging look  into another culture.	2000-05-18

I bought and read this book looooong before I had any children.  When I first read the book I thought that it was a cute story with many quotable lines.  It wasn't until recently though, now that my children are ages 1-9  that I realized that this is probably NOT fiction, but a true-to-life  account of life with children.<br />The string of events, from waking up to  gum in his hair to everything else that happens is funny.

The continuous themes of body plan, development, and evolutionary relationships provide a continuous  focus for the book.  <br />There is ample material in this book for any most  groups of invertebrates.  This book would work well for an undergraduate or  a graduate level course.  The line drawings and BW photos are great.  The  text is well written, and comprehensive taxonomic information is  included.<br />I hope Brusca and Brusca come out with a 2nd edition, since  this book was published ten years ago.  If they do, it will be a top  candidate for my invert zool course in the future.<br />5 stars.	2000-05-17

If are like my wife and I, as soon as we learned that we were pregnant my wife immersed herself in Dr. Spock and other &quot;reputable&quot; child care and parenting books.   Being of a somewhat different ilk, I undertook my own brand of pre-baby  training with this wonderful primer about babies, where they come from,  what happens when they get here, why they do what they do, and how to cope  with it all as a parent.<br />Know what?  Dave Barry's book is the most  readable, enjoyable, and useful introduction to the little people who show  up at our homes that I have ever seen.  Move over Dr. Spock!  <br />Dave gives  advice about diapers and dealing with unsolicited advice on parenting.  He  also explains in perfectly understandable detail why babies spit up their  food (it's the &quot;food-return loop&quot; that causes it), drool, and  other typically unexplainable baby behaviors.  In addition, there are tips  to fathers about when diapers need to be changed, etc.<br />Read it and weep  or laugh out loud, depending on whether your baby's already home or still  on the way.  This book presents real life...no sugar coating here!<br />This  book also makes a great wedding present!<br />5 stars, no doubt about it!	2000-05-17

It  explains that it doesn't really matter who all those people are who show up  at the closing...but that it's your responsibility to keep writing out the  checks as long as someone is in line.<br />There are hillariously practical  tips to searching for, buying, and maintaining your home.  Dave presents  hints and suggestions that will help you to appear knowledgeable while  looking at houses, how to get into serious debt, and even about challenges  you will face while redecorating.<br />He even has the audacity to suggest  that it's possible to redecorate &quot;for under $650,000.&quot;  Come on  Dave!  Everyone knows that's impossible!<br />And when you are all done fixing  up, being worn down, and you are ready to sell your home, he also presents  hints on how to fool someone into buying your &quot;black  hole.&quot;<br />Great stuff through and through!  5 stars for humor and real  life applicability!	2000-05-17

A guide to the &quot;really most sincerely dead&quot; animals one often sees along streets, roads, and highways.   While some may dismiss this book as a parody of other field guides, it is  full of accurate, meaningful biological information about animals that  frequent roads and roadsides, and that often find themselves smashed into  two dimensions.<br />Is this book funny?  Yes!  Is it a parody on other field  guides?  Perhaps.<br />So, what is this book about anyway?  This is a guide to  the animal remains left behind after most carrion feeders and decomposers  are done with a dead animal.  EEEeeeww[...]  OK, OK, perhaps it is a bit  grotesque, but there is meaningful biological information to be had  there.<br />The book is well written, it is fun, and can be used throughout  much of North America.  <br />It makes a great gift for the natualist on your  gift list.  After all, let's face it, most of us spend more time on the  road than we do out &quot;in&quot; nature.  <br />As a biologist myself, I  give this book 5 stars for biological content and for the tongue in cheek  approach to this somewhat unsavory topic.<br />Give it a try!  Or give it to  someone else.	2000-05-17

The  topics are still pertinent, the concepts and problems are well defined, and  possible solutions presented still bear consideration.<br />If you are  interested in the environment, and changes that we are faced with, you  ought to read this book.  Topics include global warming, feeding the human  population, forests and deforestation, acidification of water resources,  and more.<br />The afterword by Gro Harlem Grundtland is a fitting end to this  book.  <br />An excellent book that still bears consideration.	2000-05-16

This was one of my favorite books when I was a child.  I even bought a book to have in reserve BEFORE I got married.  <br />Margaret Wise Brown has put together a rhythmic, engaging story about a bunny that seeks for its  own place.  As the story progresses there are lessons that can be learned  and taught about changes of the seasons, and where animals live and what  they do.<br />I like the pictures, the story, the whole ball of wax.  We have  read this book over and over to our children.  When it resurfaces from the  bottom of a stack of books it still gets read through a couple of times --  by popular demand!<br />5 stars all the way.	2000-05-16

The little bat is accepted by the birds, but somehow never feels at home, especially after a good scolding from the mother bird about hanging upside down --  hillarious.<br />The artwork is outstanding, the story is entertaining, and  children and adults love this book.  I have even picked it up and read it a  time or two after the children went to bed.  <br />This is an award winning  book, and for good reason.  There are strong underlying messages in it  about place, acceptance, home and family.  <br />Definitely 5+ stars.	2000-05-16

As such, it makes a great companion set  of keys to &quot;Light's Manual: Intertidal Invertebrates of the Central  California Coast&quot; by Smith and Carlton, and &quot;Marine Algae of  California&quot; by Abbott and Hollenberg.  That set of 3 books is a  treasure for people who need good taxonomic information on nearshore marine  life to support what they do along the pacific coast of North  America.<br />Back to Kozloff's book...the book has the keys themselves, as  well as supporting BW photographs and great line drawings to help the  reader interpret particularly sticky parts of the keys. There are also  brief occasional notes about known ranges of some animals covered, but this  is not a reference book to the ecology of these animals, it is an excellent  set of taxonomic keys.<br />The book is a reprint of a 1987 publication.  As  such some names of taxonomic groups have changed in the intervening 13  years.  Nevertheless, this book remains the best set of keys for this  region that we have.	2000-05-16

I have read many of Clavell's novels based in the orient -- SHOGUN, TAIPAN, GAIJIN, WHIRLWIND, KING RAT, etc., and in my opinion SHOGUN is at the top of the pile!  <br />I lived in Japan for 2 years.  As I read Shogun I  could see clear similarities between Japanese history, culture, and even  much of modern living that is in many ways a direct result of feudal  samurai Japan presented in the book.<br />The immersion of any unprepared  European into feudal Japanese culture, as the character John Blackthorn was  in the book, is enough to make anyone's head spin.  I was intruiged by the  way Blackthorn dealt with things, and with the way that the internal  politics of Japan at the time came through so well.<br />I found the book to  be historically and culturally accurate -- sure, yeah, and then?  More  importantly though, I found that the book presents unexpected twists and  turns, and outstanding character development.<br />If you are interested in  reading a Clavell novel, definitely start with this one.

Nybakken's text, however, is designed with the upper division biology major as its primary audience. This book  is, in my opinion, the best book on the market to support an undergraduate  course in marine biology for majors.<br />Nybakken takes a community ecology  approach to his discussions of the marine environment.  There are chapters  that address communities of the plankton, nekton, deep sea, nearshore  subtidal regions, intertidal habitats, estuaries and marshes, the tropics  and the poles, and so forth.<br />The photographs and illustrations are good,  the text is well written, and examples are widely known.  It may be true  that Nybakken tends to pull more heavily on examples from the West Coast of  the USA, but there are also ample numbers of examples from other areas of  the world that support the text.<br />Each chapter is supported by a list of  references from the professional (primary) scientific literature --  something a serious biology student would appreciate and use.  <br />This is  an easy book to teach from and to learn from.  The information is  excellent, the examples are clear, and the supporting graphics are  good.<br />It is also notable that Nybakken not only discusses the biology of  marine organisms, but he addresses the stewardship we have to conserve the  planet's vital assemblage of marine resouces and biodiversity.	2000-05-10

The story follows well-established historical chronologies of this massive, dreadful  battle.   The characters are real, and their attitudes, actions, and  intentions are protrayed well.  I was drawn into the book and the events  surrounding and involved in the battle at Gettysburg.  The characters  became real to me, as did their suffering, defeats, and successes.  <br />If  you have any interest in American History in general, or in the American  Civil War (or the War Between the States, as you may prefer), I heartily  recommend this book.  It is captivating and well-written.  <br />Top marks!  5  stars.	2000-05-10

In the book you will be introduced to CAMs (cell adhesion molecules), SAMs (substrate adhesion molecules), and CJMs (cell  junction molecules) that are produced and used by the body to keep itself  organized and literally stuck together as it develops and grows. The  processes of development and growth are extremely complex, and involve  interactions among many different entities in the body. As the header  suggests, this book is not an easy read; it presents abstract concepts, and  the author uses extremely complex sentence constructions to tell his story.  This is not a book for the faint of heart, it is written with the  professional biologist in mind.<br />If you have the strength and the courage,  I suggest that you give this book a try<br />P.S.  I am the &quot;reader&quot;  from Manchester College in the previous review -- I didn't get my name on  that one though.	2000-05-08

Ellis' book on sharks is probably better known than this book on whales, but both are great.  The cornerstone of the book are his numerous paintings of a variety of whales.  <br />Ellis also puts forth a good effort in  describing what is know about this group of marine mammals.  He addresses  aspects of the biology, ecology, and behavior of whales.<br />Though lacking  references to the professional scientific literature, Ellis does a good job  in introducing this group to the non-technical crowd.  If you or a child of  yours is interested in whales, this is a great book to have around.<br />A  highly recommended introduction to the whales.	2000-05-04

In this book Ellis focuses on dolphins and porpoises.  The paintings by Ellis are, as in his books on sharks and whales, the main marketing vehicles for the book.   <br />To his credit, Ellis provides a substantial amount of accurate  supporting information about the biology, ecology, and behavior, of this  group of marine mammals.  <br />Though not a technical text on dolphins and  porpoises, it is a great primer on the group.  If you, a family member, or  friend are interested in dolphins and their kin, then I highly recommend  this book to you.<br />Top-notch introduction to the group.	2000-05-04

This book can serve as a great endtable book with itslarge-page (12.5&quot; x 9&quot;) format and accurate paintings of avariety of sharks by R. Ellis, but this book is more than that. <br />The book has excellent illustrations, paintings, and photographs, and biographies of several prominent shark researchers, conservationists, and shark-hunters.  But more importantly, this book does a good job of summarizing aspects of the biology, ecology, and evolution of this amazing and intruiging group of animals.<br />Is this &quot;the&quot; definitive shark book?  I would say that's a safe statement for the non-technical crowd.  The only thing it needs to keep the technical crowd happy is a comprehensive list of references to scientific literature that was used to provide the information detailed in the book.<br />If you are interested in marine life, and in the lives and times of this group of top predators, then this book is for you.<br />Top marks, even though some of the information is becoming somewhat dated.	2000-05-04

Many of the animals included in the book have geographic ranges that extend well to the north and the south of  California, so this book is useful to anyone who lives, visits, or works  along the west coast of North America.<br />This is not a book of taxonomic  keys, like Light's Manual.  It is, rather, a book that provides a summary  of the biology and ecology of invertebrates of the west coast.  The authors  provide lists of the best research literature for each animal (up through  1980), as well as photographs and line drawings that show what the animals  look like.<br />This is not a field book, per se, but copies of this book are  found on the shelves of most marine biological laboratories in the world,  and on the shelves of most invertebrate zoologists who have visited the  west coast of the USA.<br />A professor of mine once said, &quot;That is a  'big boy' book.&quot;  And, as books on invertebrates go, he is  right.<br />This book is well worth the price!	2000-05-03

This book contains taxonomic keys and information about the majority of intertidal invertebrate animals that live along the California Coast.  <br />The keys  have supplementary illustrations that help the reader figure out what  animal is in their bucket, or in the tide pool at their feet.<br />There are  entries that are unavoidably out of date due to the publication date.  The  reliability and usefulness of the taxonomic keys and supporting information  in this book, however, still ring true.  <br />A wonderful reference book to  the invertebrates of California.<br />The only reason I didn't give the book 5  stars was that its publication year (1975) is causing its contents to slip  out of date.  <br />Anyone up for putting together a new edition?	2000-05-03

Each  photo in the book is accompanied by a brief summary of identifying  characteristics of the organism itself, a description of habitats where  they are likely to be seen, the geographic range for the organism, and  brief comments that will help you look in the right kinds of places to see  things.<br />Though not a comprehensive guide to marine life of the region,  this book provides a great introduction to marine biota.  The author even  provides room in the book for you to write down where and when you saw each  entry.

The authors provide adequate depth for undergraduate courses in invertebrate zoology, and good fodder for graduate  students starting in the discipline as well.  <br />There are outstanding  collections of line drawings in the text -- a method of illustration I  prefer to photographs for most instructional purposes.  <br />There is good  coverage of invertebrate animal groups, but, since it's published in 1994,  there are a few places where the book is becoming dated.  There is, for  example, no information about the Cycliophora, the latest invertebrate  phyla to be proposed.  <br />I hope that there will continue to be new  editions of this text produced.  I cut my teeth on the 3rd edition, and  other editions have figured prominently as I have worked through my  graduate and professional careers.<br />Top-notch material.  If you are  considering which text to select for an invertebrate zoology course, I urge  you to give this book a look.	2000-05-03

I selected the text for two reasons: 1) the book is current, with a publication year of 2000; and 2) the author made an effort to address not only major phyla but smaller phyla as well.<br />This is a good book for a  one-semester undergraduate course in invertebrate zoology, but if you are  looking for anything more, you ought to consider other options, such as  books by Ruppert and Barnes, or Brusca and Brusca, or Pearse and  Pearse.<br />Pechenik does a good job in covering the water front of  invertebrate diversity, though there are places where depth is somewhat  lacking.  As I taught my course using this book as the primary reference, I  realized that Pechenik is more of an taxonomic lumper than I am.  If you  are a lumper you will enjoy this book's treatment of various groups (e.g.,  pentastomida, asteroids and ophiuroids, etc.).  If you tend to be a bit  more of a splitter, then you will find areas where you are not in line with  the text's information.<br />The supporting illustrations are fine, though I  wish there were a few more there.  I understand that the author's goal was  to produce a shorter book that is still rigorous enough to support  college-level courses.  He did an admirable job of that, but I found myself  looking time and again to other sources for additional information for  class.  <br />A good book, but not one that &quot;has it all.&quot;	2000-05-03

Dawkins' book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; is an attempt to explain how evolution, development, and animal behavior all contribute to the kinds of living things around us.<br />The main theme of the book is that genes are  the units that are in control, and in order for them to perpetuate  themselves (to their own selfish ends), they have combined and cooperated  with other selfish genes to produce large structurally complex biological  machines that have only one driving force -- to replicate themselves,  thereby allowing the selfish genes that produced them to also be  replicated.<br />Much of the explanation of things follows suit.  I did not,  however, swallow it all hook line and sinker.  The main point of the book  is designed to get you to think about how genes may not only have worked to  generate the physical bodies that organisms have, but their various  behaviors as well.<br />I believe that Dawkins' point goes a bit too far on  the gene driven side, and doesn't allow enough allowance for environmental  considerations during an organism's life span in explaining the origin of  animal behavior.<br />I read this book with a group of undergraduate students  last fall.  While most of them didn't buy into the whole story completely,  the book did get them to THINK about things.  And that, in my opinion, is  what the book is all about.<br />Whatever you do, make sure that you read  the book AND the endnotes for each chapter as you go.  It'll make more  sense that way, and the end notes let you see how some of his thoughts  developed, and how some of them were eventually discarded by him.<br />By the  way, I enjoyed the two new chapters Dawkins added at the end of the 1989  edition, though the last chapter was basically an advertisement for another  of his books, &quot;The Extended Phenotype.&quot;<br />Worth a deliberate  read.	2000-05-01

Not long after we join our heroine tragedy strikes and she is left  alone.  You will find yourself empathising with Raptor Red as she deals  with various challenges.  Bakker does a good job at presenting situations  and an entire story line without endulging in much if any anthropomorphism.   Dinosaurs are, after all, dinosaurs, not humans.<br />Dr. Bob Bakker is one  of the world's leading dinosaur paleontologists, and he weaves an  intruiging tale of historical fictional based on real fossil evidence and  supporting information, and on ideas that are gaining popularity in the way  we view dinosaurs and how they interacted with each other and their  environment.<br />I recommend this book to readers of all ages and interests.   Adults will be fascinated by it, children will enjoy it, and even  scientists will admit that it could have happened the way Bakker tells it.   This is a great book to read to or with your family.  <br />I encourage you to  give it a try.	2000-02-08

This book has set the standard for reference guides to marine life along the Pacific Coast, as well as  other locations.  It is much more than a field guide -- though it also  serves that role.  This book describes the intertidal zonation patterns of  the Pacific Coast as well as the ecology and aspects of the natural history  of the organisms that live there.  The book contains good taxonomic  references as well.  This is the book that many of the country's marine  scientists cut their professional teeth on. If you are interested in marine  biology, the diversity of life, or the ecology of nearshore habitats, this  book is definitely for you.  The main strength of the book is the logical  organization by type of habitat and vertical elevation on the intertidal  zone.  The main challenge of a book like this is to remain up to date,  which the publisher has managed by producing revised editions on regular  basis.  This book is a must for any field or arm chair marine naturalist!	1999-05-19

The book is pitched well for the  undergraduate student.  One thing that attracted me was the attention  Kozloff pays to the smaller phyla, groups that are often given little time  and space or are even left out completely in other texts developed for the  undergraduate crowd. The line drawings and figures are good.  If you are  looking for a book to support an ecological/natural history flavor, then  check out this book.  If you want more emphasis on taxonomy try Rupert and  Barnes.  If you want an evolutionary approach, try Brusca and Brusca.  I  have used this book for my Jr/Sr level invertebrate zoology course since it  came out and I have been quite happy with it, but if there's not an update  in the near future I may need to consider switching texts.	1999-05-19

This book includes good illustrations and photographs,  descriptions of where marine flora and fauna live and what they do there.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to go the seashore of the  Pacific Northwest and figure out what they are looking at. Kozloff has been  there and seen everything he's writing about.

This book represents Rudolf Raff's latest effort to shed light on the imporance of developmental biology to the future development of evolutionary theory and research.  After all, evolution and its processes  are evident in genes, developmental patterns and processes, and in the form  of living things (animals in the case of this book).  The main strength of  this book is its approach to showing how the reintegration of developmental  biology and evolutionary thought can help us better understand and describe  how things came to be the way they are.  The main weakness of the book is  the limitation of the book's content to animal forms only.  I appreciated  the discussions showing how developmental processes allow for higher  degrees of plasticity at the earliest stages of development and in later  stages, but that developmental plasticity is minimized at the phylotype --  the stage of development that defines the body plan of the organism.  This  is an important book for developmental biologists and evolutionary  biologists alike.	1999-05-14

Raup does a great job outlining many of the leading ideas regarding extinction theory. Ideas in the book are presented with examples that are easy to follow, and Raup points out possibilities without overburdening the  reader with a heavy-handed dose of bias, leaving readers to make up their  own minds about things.  I particularly appreciated the range of ideas  covered by the author regarding current thought about extinction.  The book  seemed a bit light for a scientific audience, but it is pitched well for  the lay naturalist reader.  I'm glad I read it.	1999-05-14

I found Darwin's insights  and synthesis of ideas, based on the accumulation of carefully collected  observations combined with intellectual leaps to be inspiring. There are  flaws in portions of the book to be sure, but this is a book that all  biologists and biology students should have a chance to read and discuss.   When you read it, make sure you read the entire book, discuss it with a  friend or two as you read, and you can look forward to a perfect conclusion  to this paradigm shifting book that continues to influence modern  biological thought.	1999-05-14

This autobiography of one of world's foremost biogeographers and proponents of the conservation of biodiversity should be read by every undergraduate and graduate biology student in the country.  It provides  insights into how one can gain insight into the natural world, where  scientific questions can come from, the importance of looking for detail,  and a perspective on how science can be done.  The book is well written and  informative.  It also provides a sense of perspective for all the people  out there who, as children (or adults), found themselves drawn to puddles  of water, weedy fields, seashores, or other havens of biodiversity.

No!  This is the story of a great scientist who happens to be blind, but who is certainly not without a vision of the world around him.  Dr. Vermeij chronicles his life and  development as a scientific thinker and worker.  He draws the reader in as  he tells what it's like to work one's way through the ranks and halls of  academia, and how he had to simultaneously overcome prejudices and  preconceptions others hold about what it means to be blind.  He also tells  of an ongoing life centered on the accumulation of knowledge, contemplation  of those ideas, and the generation of important contributions to his field.   The account of his development as a scientific thinker and worker was a  great read, but the perspective he provides on life without sight is  outstanding.  I'd rate the book 5 stars for myself, and 4 stars for a more  general audience: five stars for myself because, as an invertebrate  zoologist, I felt a strong connection to the topics and experiences  described; and 4 starts for a non-scientific audience.  It's clear that  this book was written prior to the end of his career, and I hope to see  another installment on Dr. Vermeij's life in another decade or two.	1999-05-13

The main focus of the book is to teach the principles of counseling in councils and to show how anyone can apply those principles in virtually any organization.  <br />The book provides concrete examples that show how to counsel in a wide variety of church and family councils.  Those examples show how this approach can be used to empower members of councils (including family members), thereby building the overall effectiveness and productivity of all participants.<br />I am working to apply these principles; they work! I recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to find ways to work more effectively, and to include fuller participation and increased productivity of council! s in which they participate.	1998-07-27
