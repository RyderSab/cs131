Ann Rule has penned a real-life monster story with \\"Last Dance, Last Chance.\\" Here she tells the story of Doctor Anthony Pignataro, the son of a prominent Buffalo, NY surgeon, who lacked any of the gifts his father had. He masked his insecurity and incompetence with a veneer of arrogance and attitude that alienated most of those around him. In fact the only person besides his mother to stand by him through years of failed attempts to finish a medical residency program was his wife Debbie.<br />Not only was Tony Pignataro crude, rude and offensive to most people, but he showed little true affection for his family unless he needed something from them. In fact, he was a philandering husband, caught in at least two affairs by his long-suffering wife.<br />Pignataro ventured into cosmetic surgery after inventing a permanent hairpiece that attached to the skull via titanium implants. He made a fortune doing this procedure along with the occasional breast implantation and tummy tuck in his understaffed office. His poor work habits ultimately had deadly consequences when a young woman died during a routine breast augmentation procedure.<br />As a result, Pignataro lost his medical license and his practice, developed a heroin habit and continued an affair with a stripper named Tami, whom he decided to make a new life with as soon as he could dispose of his wife. He attempted to do so during a brief reconciliation period.<br />His plans went awry when Debbie survived the massive poisoning, and with the tests proving she was poisoned, investigators soon focused on Tony as their lead suspect. This is a chilling tale of a conscienceless killer who had everything going for him and trashed it all through his own greed and lust for adoration.<br />This is another testament as to why Ann Rule is the best at her craft.	2003-06-12

This is the first of Stephen Hunter's books that I've read and it remains a vivid experience years later. Hunter brings all his characters to life, especially the monstrous Lamar Pye, a conscienceless killer who, along with his mentally slow, but physically imposing cousin Odell, form a two-man wrecking crew.<br />Lamar and Odell break out of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary with a third inmate, a weak-kneed felon with an impressive artistic talent, who seeks protection from Lamar. The three escaped cons cut a wide, violent swath across the southwest, dogged by Oklahoma State Trooper Bud Pewtie who'd almost been killed by Lamar Pye earlier and is determined to bring both Lamar and Odell to justice.<br />Where Hunter's story differs from the normal 'cops and robbers' fare is that he doesn't charicature Lamar and Odell. Lamar is portrayed with pathos as a loser who never stood a chance, clinging to an idealized view of what a family is and what right and wrong are, completely unaware of how twisted his vision is. Hunter delivers an unflinching view of a socio-path's mind and the strange bond of violence that tie both Lamar and Odell to Bud Pewtie in a death dance of retribution.<br />Not only is this a terrific story it's an unforgettable one as well.	2003-06-11

Paul Berman's \\"Terror and Liberalism\\" is an excellent attempt at finding common ground between America's political Left and Right, at least when it comes to the current \\"War on Terror.\\" Berman painstakingly shows Islamic fundamentalism for what it is, a mass political movement, actually the combining of two mass political movements - pan-Arabism (ie. the Baath party) and pan-Islamacism (ie. al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad) that are both devoted to violence and diametrically opposed to the Western Liberal tradition.<br />Berman also argues that the Left in America has as much at stake in the \\"War on Terror\\" as do those on the Right.<br />Paul Berman's historical research is excellent, following the path of the modern pan-Islamic movement to its roots with Sayyid Qutb (ku-tab) author of \\"In the Shade of the Qur'an,\\" \\"Social Justice in Islam\\" and other works. Qutb attended the Colorado State College of Education in the late 1940's and earned a Masters Degree, but came away thoroughly disgusted with what he saw as \\"the barbarous West.\\" He was especially disgusted by what the West hailed as \\"the emancipation of women\\" and \\"sexual liberation.\\"<br />At the same time that pan-Islamacism was growing, pan-Arabism was coming into political prominence behind such figures as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. Though the differences between the two camps were subtle - pan-Arabists wanted a return of the old Ottoman Empire, while pan-Islamacists envisioned a world under shariah (the legal code of Islam) - they were also volatile. Berman describes the differences between the two groups as akin to the differences between the Italian fascists under Mussolini who sought to rebuild the Roman Empire and the German Nazis who sought a return to the Roman Empire in a Germanic form. Indeed the Arab world sided with the Axis powers during World War II, which led to England and the U.S. setting up the state of Israel in what was then the Palestine territories.<br />In 1966 shortly after Colonel Nasser took power in Egypt, several attempts were made on his life. He blamed them on his alienating Qutb's group, the Islamic Brotherhood and had Sayyid Qutb hung in retribution. Still, despite their differences, the two factions have been bound by a hatred of Israel and the West that ignites their common passions.<br />After delving into the history of pan-Arabism and pan-Islam, Berman takes on what he sees as a misguided view among many Western Leftists like Noam Chomsky, who've rationalized terrorism as the only possible response to Western oppression by less technologically advanced nations. People like Ramsey Clark and Noam Chomsky have defined Islamic fundamentalist terrorism as an appropriate response by a smaller opponent to a bully, while Berman sees it as a cataclysmic struggle between two conflicting ideologies, one rooted in individual liberty, the separation of Church and State, a love of technology and women's suffrage and the other one diametrically opposed to all of these things on virtually every level.<br />\\"Terror and Liberalism\\" is an excellent book that not only gives the reader a broader understanding of the roots of fundamentalist Islam, but an insight into why so many on the American Left reflexively support any movement willing to take on the bully they see as America's \\"Military-Industrial Complex,\\" and why that view is not only wrong-headed, but dangerous as well.er took power in Egypt, several attempts were made on his life.

After spending ten years following an extended Bronx family through prisons, infatuations, emergency rooms, homelessness and welfare offices, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc has written &quot;Random Family,&quot; a riveting account of the high price of poverty - all too often a reckless, violent, trauma-prone and relatively brief life.<br />The book treats its subjects with dignity in chronicling the maze of social service bureaucracies the poor face in dealing with the everyday travails of poverty.<br />What it fails to do is to criticize the stunningly irresponsible decisions that lead many people to this life and the innate inefficiencies of these systems and the way that government assistance and institutionalization often become traps and \\"ways of life\\" for far too many of America's poor.<br />Still, Ms. LeBlanc's writing is crisp and raw and she focuses an unblinking eye on some of the uglier aspect of inner city life. LeBlanc writes very well and very forcefully, but the poor personal choices that many of her subjects make are rationalized. We witness young teens becoming mothers and in turn grandmothers by thirty, and often mothers again to children their own offspring can't raise and young boys (in this case, Cesar and Boy George) aspiring to gangsterism and the &quot;opportunities&quot; provided by \\"the thug life,\\" without comment or judgment.<br />&quot;Random Families&quot; is a stark and often depressing book especially because it shows so little chance of things changing. After all, reckless and irresponsible people, living in reckless and irresponsible environments usually beget reckless and irresponsible children...and the cycle continues.<br />&quot;Random Family&quot; is a very well written and gripping book that is unafraid to touch even the rawest nerve.	2003-05-07

Fareed Zakaria dismantles the view that democracy, in and of itself, is a cure-all for mankind's social ills. In fact, he reserves some high praise for countries like Chile and Singapore, which liberalized their economies first and their political systems later.<br />Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman worked closely with Chile in liberalizing their economy in the seventies and eighties and Friedman claimed the experience changed his mind about the priority of political freedom in relation to economic liberty, saying he came away realizing that economic freedom was the foundation of all other liberties.<br />Zakaria is not hesitant to suggest that democracy isn't applicable to every culture, an idea that is highly controversial within the borders of the United States, but that's part of what makes this book so compelling, especially for those interested in the possible dynamics involved in our current attempt to \\"democratize\\" Iraq.<br />Even more controversial is Fareed Zakaria's critique of the current \\"descent of democracy\\" in America. In Zakaria's view, American democracy has morphed into \\"a simple-minded populism\\" that too often values style over substance.<br />A lot of readers approach such public policy analyses with trepidation, but Fareed Zakaria is incredibly readable! He makes what so many people regard as \\"policy wonk stuff,\\" accessible to laymen and professionals alike.<br />The \\"The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad\\" is not just a riveting read, it's a book that couldn't be more timely.	2003-04-15

This book is sure to be loudly denounced and vehemently derided, but coming, as it does, from a member of Clinton's own military security detail, it will most likely never be debunked.<br />Lieutenant Colonel Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson penned &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; after his retirement because he would never have been able to publish this kind of information while working for the government.<br />&quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a gripping, yet horrifying read that'll have you realizing how lucky the U.S. was during the eight year Clinton/Gore Administration. One of the most damning charges is that Clinton once lost the &quot;nuclear football,&quot; the suitcase that carries this country's nuclear launch codes. Clinton's response, according to Patterson, was a cavalier, &quot;I'll track'em down guys.&quot;<br />You'll also read about the time in 1998 that Clinton blew off his National Security Advisor so he could finish a round of golf, while stealth-bombers, engines running, their pilots in the cockpits, sat on a Mid-East tarmac  until the cover of darkness was lost and a vital mission against Saddam Hussein was called off.<br />Patterson also gives an entirely new look at the &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; story, with Clinton denying the troops the weaponry they requested, then sending them into harm's way and ultimately blaming the disaster on his Secretary of Defense.<br />&quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot; is a searing indictment of the Clinton administration from an insider's view.<br />This book deserves to be read by every American!	2003-03-22

Think the Saudis are America's allies?<br />You'll think again after reading Dore Gold's book, \\"Hatred's Kingdom.\\"<br />Gold, a former Israeli Ambassador to the UN, exposes the hatred of Wahhabism, the Saudi based fundamentalist Islamic sect that has financed and supported worldwide terrorism, teaches the kind of fundamentalism embraced by Afghanistan's Taliban as well as bin Laden's (also a Saudi) al Qaeda movement.<br />Dore Gold explicitly shows how Saudi Arabia finances global terrorism and links this support to the rise of Wahhabism in that nation.<br />Gold's historical work on the rise of Wahhabism via the emergence of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab and its influence on the Saudi government is really well researched.<br />His contemporary links and research have been criticized, but the book is still compelling. All-in-all, Gold makes a strong case for Wahhabism being the backbone of Islamic fundamentalist terror.<br />\\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" is a real eye-opener for Americans raised on the belief that \\"The Saudis are our friends.\\"	2003-03-20

This one book sparked an entire genre by, largely conservative, radio talk-show hosts, from Sean Hannity to Michael Savage and Michael Reagan, so in that sense alone, it's a classic.<br />In this and its follow-up, \\"See, I Told You So,\\" Limbaugh delivers the underpinning beliefs that guide the views he espouses on his radio show. He does so clearly and convincingly and now, some ten years later, it's hard to look back and understand the controversy this book first created.<br />At the time, Rush Limbaugh was pretty much a lone voice in the wilderness. A player in the much maligned talk radio segment of the media...a segment, much of the rest of the media wished would go away.<br />It didn't go away. In fact, it's grown since those days to the point where now almost a quarter of all Americans get most of their news primarily from a news-talk radio outlet.<br />\\"The Way Things Ought to Be\\" is a quick read and an enjoyable one. Rush Limbaugh does have a very natural verbal style and I'm sure Judith Regan's editing didn't hurt either. Of course the book lacks the verbal theatrics, the outrageous political paradies and Limbaugh's trademark bombast, but it makes up for showmanship with clarity and candor.<br />Rush Limbaugh is extremely pro-free market, favors a severely limited government, lower taxes and stiffer penalties for crimes - a message that has resonated with the heartland and working people around the country - a weekly audience of over 23 million attests to that.<br />The \\"Gingrich Revolution\\" had a lot to thank Limbaugh for and so did Bill Clinton's move to the right - he started the DLC as a \\"more moderate\\" alternative to the traditional DNC.<br />Whether you like Rush Limbaugh or revile him, this book is well worth reading, if only to better understand the views that built the Limbaugh empire and spurred on so much of the current grassroots conservative movement.<br />It is a true classic.	2003-03-18

These forty-nine essays first appeared in June of 1910 and though some of the subjects may seem a bit stodgy, the writing is still fresh and riveting and the insights are clear and powerful.<br />In fact, some of the moral issues are perhaps more vital today than they were in Chesterton's time. He seemed to foresee that the diminution of our moral standards would lead to the dehumanization of mankind, he foresaw woman's suffrage and the dangers of the burgeoning corporate oligarchy.<br />All of these essays are memorable, touched with Chesterton's often dazzling verbal legerdemain. In \\"The Insane Necessity,\\" he writes, \\"...discipline means that in certain frightfully rapid circumstances, one can trust anybody so long as he is not everybody.\\" There are so many memorable more, like \\"Oppression by Optimism,\\" \\"The Unfinished Temple\\" and \\"Sincerity and the Gallows\\" that are each in their turn, breathtaking in both their focus and scope.<br />If you've never read G K Chesterton, this is a fine place to start and if you've read some of his other works and enjoyed them, you'll love this one.	2003-03-15

Thomas Chittum has written a fascinating, though in some parts flawed work, that none-the-less deserves serious attention, not merely dissmissive rebuke.<br />Chittum, a '65 - '67 Vietnam vet, then a mercenary in Rhodesia in the seventies and Croatia through 1992, bases his viewpoint on the fact that \\"all multi-ethnic empires are innately unstable.\\" He mentions the former USSR which broke up as its Muslim and Asian populations were growing and seeking their own autonomy out from under white Russian rule. He notes, accurately, that the nation state of Russis is now over 80% white Russian.<br />The problem is that many Americans view any justification of racial or ethnic identity as threatening, when they are, in fact, innately natural...humans are tribal beings. People naturally divide themselves up...religiously, ethnically, etc.<br />Chittum's experiences in Rhodesia where a brutal, repressive black government has been engaged in a deliberate campaign to eradicate the white farmers of the country, have, no doubt fueled some of his more dire predicitions...and that situation must be looked at dispassionately, the way Chittum does here.<br />Still, there are a few things that Chittum's premise overlooks about America, for one, our unified culture, our common language (English), coupled with a strong, stable government and a vibrant and diverse economy.<br />The question is, will these things be maintained if America's demographics continue along their current non-white, largely Third World path?<br />If whites are reduced to the projected 50% of the population by 2050, will largely Hispanic and black areas seek independence from what they may well perceive as \\"white rule?\\"<br />One thing's for sure, after reading the likely effects of such a Civil conflict, no one in their right mind would look forward to it.<br />The question left unanswered is, \\"What can be done to make sure we don't head down the same disastrous path the former USSR took?\\" Sadly, Chittum never really deals with that question. What he does offer is one frightening potential reality.<br />\\"Civil War II: The Coming Breakup of America\\" is both fascinating and disturbing at the same time...and well worth reading.lly deals with that question.

Mona Charen revisits the Cold War era in light of the events of 9-11 and draws a parallel between those dupes, like Walter Duranty, who lauded the former Soviet Union during the 1930's as a \\"worker's paradise\\" in the midst of Stalin's vicious purges, and those in the media and public life today, who, in the wake of 9-11-01 insist on blaming \\"American foreign policy\\" for those attacks.<br />Charen hasn't shied away from controversy in the past and this book is no exception. Liberals who purport to \\"love America and criticize it only to improve it,\\" will despise this work for lumping all Leftists in with those nefarious folks whose real agenda has been to undermine the cornerstone of American prosperity, private property rights, and would like to see our republic (government action limited by our Constitution) replaced with some form of \\"pure democracy.\\"<br />I believe that Mona Charen is right though, in at least most of her assessment of the Left (especially \\"the true believers\\"), that much of American Liberalism has been anti-American and anti-freedom. I also believe that her title is also right on the money - those who espouse anti-American sentiments while living in the freest, most prosperous nation on earth, who condemn American government without considering the broader worldview (2/3 of the \\"modern world\\" still practices chattel slavery), or decry \\"American Imperialism\\" in the face of America's history of liberating and rebuilding nations from Grenada to Kuwait to Serbia - are indeed \\"useful idiots,\\" for any anti-American cause.<br />If you believe in the founding principles of Americanism (private ownership, free markets and a Constitutional Republic) you're going to love this book, if not, you may very well hate it.	2003-03-03

Syndicated Talk Show host Michael Savage joins Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and other formerly rarely heard voices from the common sense mainstream in print, with a book that takes the name of his radio show, \\"The Savage Nation.\\" There's ample proof that this surge of successful \\"right wing\\" books has America's socialists and anti-humans, those Savage routinely calls \\"Red Diaper Doper Babies\\" or RDDBs, in an uproar.<br />Michael Savage (Michael Weiner) holds a PhD in Epidemiology from the University of California at Berkeley and can be heard nightly on his nationally syndicated Talk Radio Show. His primary, common sense theme of \\"Language, Borders, Culture\\" seems to resonate with a huge audience. His controversial demeanor and confrontational style have even sparked a number of anti-savage websites!<br />The Savage Nation basically takes Mike Savage's Talk Show and puts it into print. Now I'm biased in that I like most of Mike Savage's views, so I like the book as well, but be warned, these are views that'll have those who believe in things like open immigration, race/gender preferences and government social programs foaming at the mouth.<br />Sure, you lose some of the trademark vitriol with which Mike Savage delivers his tirades, but the book is a decent substitute for those times when The Savage Nation is preempted by other radio events.	2003-01-27

Larry Elder follows up his first book, &quot;The Ten Things You Can't Say in America&quot; with &quot;Showdown,&quot; a call for a return to limited, localized governance and liberty linked to personal responsibility. Elder's not the first to defend the Founder's design, not even the first black - Walter E Williams and Thomas Sowell have been championing less government for decades, but Larry Elder adds a strong voice to that choir and proof that what the Left likes to say about Libertarian blacks, that they are &quot;out of step with mainstream black America,&quot; is wrong. In fact, Elder would retort that people like himself, Professors Williams and Sowell, Condy Rice and Colin Powell ARE more indicative of the mainstream than their more visible Left leaning cohorts like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.<br />&quot;Showdown&quot; is a very well researched book. Elder backs up his points meticulously. He chronicles Santa Monica's disastrous &quot;Living Wage&quot; bill that recently passed...a bill that's already cost the area lots of entry level jobs. And the new California movement of &quot;Visitablity&quot; - an ordinance that would force private home owners to install ramps and other means of access, apparently for disabled door-to-door salesmen.<br />Throughout &quot;Showdown&quot; Elder shows a government run amock.

Love him or hate him, you must admit that Pat Buchanan is a true believer. He believes in the \\"fend-for-yourself\\" economic liberty that the less enlightened like to deride as \\"Social Darwinism.\\" He also sees the greatness of America as inexorably linked to its Northern European roots. It's implausible that any thinking person would have a problem with that. Perhaps that's why his enemies resort to name-calling and ad hominum attack instead of trying to make reasonable arguments.<br />For those who love America and its European roots, this is a sad, even frightening book. It's frightening partly because it details in specific the birth dearth among the most intelligent and productive people on the planet. It is sad because it chronicles an even more cancerous dearth, which in Buchanan's view, is built upon the inane foundation that \\"people are people the world over.\\" Buchanan is no silly adherant of that inane \\"brotherhood of man\\" blather, because he knows that there has never been such a \\"brotherhood.\\"<br />If you still believe that \\"people are people\\" and that \\"all cultures are equal in their validity,\\" think back to 9-11-01 and reconsider that view in light of the FACT that some people are indeed people, while many more are merely savages. The worst thing about many of today's savages is that their savagery is encouraged, even glorified by their cultures and religions, so that all these modern savages aspire to is their current status. In short, they intend to happily remain just what they are - savages.<br />This is a profound book, understandably one that will be misunderstood by those who don't think for themselves and swallow the popular pablum whole.<br />It is not for the feint of heart.	2002-10-25

They had missed the day after day mind numbing fear and brutality of guerrilla warfare that worked as a dull rasp to slowly wear away frivilous civilian emotions and fraudulent morals until nothing was left but harsh truth....Only new guys wondered why so many guys smiled during a firefight.\\"<br />Xin Loi Vietnam is a riveting, first-hand account of a war we never committed to and the terrible toll that took on the guys who served in it.<br />Al Sever's Xin Loi Vietnam is a book you won't put down. It has the ring of truth and the sting of reality.	2002-10-17

That passion is engrossingly displayed in this book. If there is anything we disagree on it's that Hannity seems to have a bit more faith in our government than I do.<br />In my view, it's not our government that makes America great, it's the protections from that government enumerated in the Bill of Rights that does. Still, I confess a personal passion for traditional values and that's why I really appreciate this book. In it Sean Hannity offers a credible and riveting defense of those principles and values.<br />\\"Let Freedom Ring\\" is a clear and concise defense of American conservative principles and stinging indictment of the Socialist American Left. It's unfortunate and objectionable that when someone writes a clear and concise work (IE \\"easy to read\\") it's labeled \\"Dumb\\" and \\"Simplistic\\" by their elitist antagonists. It's happened to Ann Coulter (\\"Slander\\") and to a lesser extent to Bernard Goldberg (\\"Bias\\") as well.<br />Typically Left-wingers are going to hate this book and conservatives are going to love it - nothing surprising there.

This is an incredible work, part personal epiphany and part futurist's vision.<br />Sause starts off by relating his musician roots and trendy Leftist worldview and how it was disrupted by, of all things, the 1993 L.A. riots. Witnessing various racial extortionists and big government advocates selling their agenda of more social programs and higher taxes like snake oil, made him rethink everything he thought he believed in.<br />Ultimately he comes to the conclusion that we are in the beginning throes of the Digital revolution, one that will eventually sweep away the Industrial revolution just as surely as the Industrial revolution swept away humanity's agrarian way of life.<br />In Sause's view, this coming Digital revolution will change our economy, our family structure and, of course, our style of government. None of this will be welcomed, especially by those at the top of the Industrial food chain, but welcome or not, it's coming as sure as summer.<br />This is not only an extremely well written book, but an eye opening one as well. A must read for anyone who wants to get a handle on the reasons behind all the social, political and economic upheavals of the past thirty years and an idea on where we might be heading.<br />A positively awe inspiring book.	2002-05-21

For those who never experienced them, they were days of double digit inflation and unemployment, coupled with sky high interest rates. If the \\"Reagan revolution,\\" undergirded by both Milton Friedman's Moneterism and Jude Wanniski's Supply Side Economics had not occured, a bloodier one may well have...the failed policies of Keynesian styled big government had failed that badly.<br />Though the entire book has been updated and revised over its long lifespan, Chapter 13; \\"Energy in Abundance\\" is extremely vital today. In it he describes the folly of the \\"doom & gloom,\\" energy scarcity adherants - \\"The planet itself is a ball of energy, that rides in a sea of energy.\\" Just how untapped are the earth's energy resources? Even today, over 80% of the oil wells ever drilled, have been drilled on the continental United States! Wanniski notes that, \\"Indeed, it can be argued that at present, there are more organic hydrocarbons being formed than are being consumed by the entire world population.\\"<br />Wanniski does the best job of explaining why the Great Depression occured since Murray Rothbard addressed it in his work, \\"The Great Depression.\\" In both his and Rothbard's view, protectionism (the Smoot-Hawley tariff among other protectionist measures) moved the world into a spiraling depression as international trade virtually dried up.<br />Wanniski coined the term \\"Supply Side Economics.\\" A term that has been attacked but not reputed by proponents of Command Economies. Most of the world today operates under some sort of Supply Side structure. Even Russia has adopted a 13% flat tax with no Capital Gains nor \\"business taxes,\\" which are actually \\"people taxes, as they're always passed on to the consumer.<br />\\"The Way the World Works\\" is a classic that puts the vagueries of economic theory into every day language and explains why individuals as entrepreneurs do a far better job of supplying the things we need than government bureaucracies do.

The video series was extremely well done and taken right from this book.<br />Friedman explains how and why markets work, why minimum wage statutes hurt instead of help unskilled labor (they price entry level or \\"training positions\\" out of the market) and why the Great Depression happened (protectionist tariffs like Smoot-Hawley devastating trade between nations was the primary reason).<br />Like Hayek and von Mises before him, Friedman explodes the Keynesian mythology that government spending is actually good for the economy. Moreover, this book is written for the layman. You don't need a PhD in economics or a Nobel Prize (both of which Professor Friedman has) to understand this work. It is clear, concise and cogently written.<br />If you want to understand why the market is ineluctable, this is a must read...and if you get the chance, I highly recommend the companion video series - some of the best work done on explaining why the free market works and planned/controlled economies fail.<br />It as timely today (despite the dated references) because the free market still works (it always will) and command/controlled economies always fail...this book tells why.	2002-04-09

Aside from Ludwig von Mises' 1,000 page tome \\"Human Action,\\" this is one of the best arguments for limited government and individual liberty penned during the tumultuous Twentieth Century.<br />Friedrich Hayek's \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" is one of the clearest rationales for why liberty and limited government is essential to progress and prosperity. Hayek knew what America's founders also knew; that even those public servants with the best intentions begin to see every problem as one that government bureaucracy can fix. In truth, most of our problems are human problems and governments tend to exacerbate rather than alleviate them.<br />When Hayek wrote this short piece back in 1944, Hitler and Stalin ruled over two of the world's largest government controlled economies and Britain's John Maynard Keynes' economic ideas were the order of the day.<br />Before the decade was out Hitler's empire was in ruins, Stalin's USSR was on a path to devastation that was only temporarily slowed by its looting of Germany after the war and Keynes was totally humiliated in two head-to-head debates with Friedrich Hayek.<br />Hayek would go on to win the Nobel Prize in economics and Keynesianism would fall to \\"fiscal conservatism\\" and Milton Friedman's Monetarism as championed by the likes of Reagan, Thatcher and Gingrich.<br />It's ironic that a century and a half after America was founded on individualism and limited governance, those ideals would be reinvigorated by the Austrian School of Economics, led by Hayek and von Mises. This book is a testament as to why that is.<br />How far has socialism fallen since Hayek wrote this book? Well in the spring of 2002, some fifty-eight years after its publication, Russia has adopted a 13% across the board flat tax. A \\"risky scheme\\" in the eyes of many of America's \\"mainstream Democrats.\\"<br />\\"The Road to Serfdom\\" demonstrates why command economies fail and free economies thrive. Individual liberty has had no better champion than Friedrich Hayek.	2002-04-09

The Reverend Joseph Brandt has created a cottage industry of providing \\"diversity seminars\\" on College campuses across the nation. Most of his teachings are encapsulated in this book.<br />What's wrong with Brandt's track? Well, it's a screed, more than it is a book. A screed that blames whites for all the evils of the world and sees \\"racism\\" solely from the view of \\"white against other.\\" This ignores the reality that (1) bigotry NOT \\"racism\\" is the problem and (2) every ethnic group, in every culture harbors some petty bigotries.<br />This makes Brandt's ideas not merely misguided and wrong-headed but dangerous. Brandt's views feed the anti-white bigotry that is endemic in much of the African-American community. How can an ideology that promotes bigotry help end it? In short, it can't.<br />Worse yet, Brandt can't back up his viewpoints with facts so instead he quotes Old Testament scripture, often unrelated to his assertions. People like Brandt make a living off \\"racism,\\" both real and perceived, so they have no vested interest in finding any legitimate solutions to dealing with bigotry. In fact, his teaching promote bigotry as a path to dealing with \\"racism.\\"<br />Confused? You're not alone.<br />The fact is that \\"racism\\" is defined as believing your own race to be superior to others. In that regard anyone who exhibits any kind of racial pride - white pride, black pride or any other, is, by definition, \\"racist.\\" The more insecure and less educated a person is, the more likely they are to take pride in things like race that they've no control over. Pride should be reserved for achievements. None of us \\"achieved\\" being born black or Asian or white.<br />Bigotry is something else altogether. Bigotry is the hating of others for what they are. That's why bigotry is a lot more dangerous than \\"racism\\" is and it's also why so many people use the term \\"racism\\" when they really mean bigotry. The inane definition that \\"racism is the use of power by one group over another\\" is specious. Ethnic majorities and minorities have peacefully coexisted all over the globe despite the majority (regardless of race) having voting and purchasing power over the minorities.<br />That's why this book is so destructive, it claims to seek an end to \\"racism\\" through the promotion of anti-white bigotry. I wish I could find something nice to say about this tract, but it is demonstrably wrong in its approach, misguided in the viewpoint it proffers and dangerous in that it actually promotes a virulent anti-white bigotry.<br />I've never given a book a single star before but this one gets just that.s specious.

No small feat considering that 1 of every 3 books published fails to make any money at all and fewer than 1% sell more than a million copies, the way this book did.<br />Smith captured forever the day to day grind of inner city firefighters, before air masks were used regularly. He brings the reader into the last days of pre-modern, urban firefighting, the suffocating heat, the blinding smoke, the gut wrenching fear and most of all the camaraderie that comes along with a job that requires disciplined teamwork and exacting attention to detail.<br />Report opens up with a fire, of course, where Engine 82 and Ladder 31 are forced to breach or break through a wall to get a teenager out of a rear bedroom of a burning apartment. The first two firefighters from Engine 82 enter without air masks and take a terrible beating before they're relieved on the line by two members who are \\"tanked up.\\" Smith takes the reader through the entire event, step by agonizing step.<br />Smith lets us see the teeming ghetto that existed around his Intervale Avenue firehouse at the time - today, that same area is covered with single family Nehemia Homes. He takes the reader through the emergencies (gas and water leaks), car accidents, false alarms and spectacular fires, from a firefighter's perspective. In it, he chronicles the death of a fireman, from Engine 82, who fell off the back of the rig, or backstep, while responding to a false alarm. In those days, firefighters still \\"rode outside\\" the rig, hanging off the back of the Engine or Pumper by holding onto straps that hung off a rear metal bar across the \\"backstep\\" or rear of the rig.<br />Dennis Smith worked in the early part of a quarter century period (from the late sixties to the late eighties) that saw 30% of all the buildings in NYC burned. Entire tracts of the South Bronx and huge swaths of Brooklyn were reduced to prairie like fields. Thousands of other buildings were made vacant.<br />I work in the same area today...about a mile and a half west of Engine 82 & Ladder 31. When I first arrived there in 1986 there were tons of vacant buildings, left over remnants from the firestorm of the previous decade. I've known lots of firefighters who went through that period. Most of them have been put out of the job with various forms of cancer, emphysema, throat disorders etc. The effects of swallowing all that smoke are well documented thanks to their sacrifices. Most of NYC's inner city firefighters from that period are dead now.<br />Of course, air masks are mandatory now (thank God!) and bunker gear has been mandated as of 1994. Despite all that, New York has lost over twenty firefighters in the line of duty over the past five years alone, 764 in its history - pre-9/11.<br />The book is divided into numerous vignettes which cover the range of incidents Engine 82 responded to, the squalor of the South Bronx, the good natured ribbing of firehouse life, while contrasting the job and that area, to his home and family life in Westchester County, about 30 miles north of New York City.<br />If there is any nit to be picked with this book, it's that the other firefighters are not very well developed characters. This may have been due to Smith's reluctance to expose the real people he'd worked with. Still, it's a quick and compelling read. Smith has an engaging story telling style and a good-hearted humility and strong sense of humanity that shines through the book. A must for fire buffs everywhere and an interesting behind-the-scenes story about our very recent history for others.re tracts of the South Bronx and huge swaths of Brooklyn were reduced to prairie like fields.

There are only a handful of books that have really changed the way I've looked at things; Jerzy Kosinski's The Painted Bird, Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, Julian Jayne's The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bi-Cameral Mind, Ludwig von Mises' Human Action and Robert M. Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (ZAMM). Pirsig's book may be the most profound because it not only challenges, but re-labels our entire thought process, challenging many of our most deeply held values. In fact, it's subtitled, (An Inquiry Into Values).<br />Proof that I'm not alone in assessing the impact of ZAMM is the fact that it has remained in print for nearly three decades since it was first published in 1974. That's quite an achievement for a book with such a clunky title - a book whose first publisher warned Pirsig not to expect \\"much more\\" than the $5,000 advance because, \\"works of this kind rarely sell in volume\\" and whose author readily states up front that it \\"has little to do with the study of Zen and isn't all that accurate when it comes to motorcycle maintenance either.\\"<br />On the surface, ZAMM is a very simple story about the narrator's cross-country trip on motorcycle with his emotionally troubled son, Chris and their technologically challenged neighbors, John and Sylvia Sutherland. Pirsig wraps a brilliant philosophical analysis of values, in a road story that pits Phaedrus (the narrator's former self) against his current, post-electroshock persona, his son and the techno-phobic Sutherland's.<br />The story unfolds as a series of talks or Chautauquas, in which the narrator explores such topics as \\"Classical (emphasis on underlying function) Vs Romantic (emphasis on external form)\\" styles of thinking, \\"defining quality\\" and \\"insanity as a rejection of the accepted mythos\\" (an idea previously explored by Thomas Szass).<br />Ultimately, Pirsig does nothing less than re-focus the nature and definition of QUALITY. What is it? How do we define the \\"present\\" when everything we're conscious of has already happened, been processed and is already a part of the past?<br />Phaedrus looks at quality and notes, \\"we all know it when we see it, but how is it truly defined? What makes one thing of greater or less \\"quality\\" then another?\\" He comes close to quantifying it in his \\"Church of Reason Lecture,\\" which starts on page 142 of the original paperback release.<br />Pirsig breaks the world down into two outlooks, Classic (which focuses on the underlying function) and Romantic (which focuses on the outer-lying form). Aesthetics (the study of beauty) is form based or Romantic thinking, while mechanics (the study of how things work) is function based or Classical thinking. He uses this to explain why different people see the same world in very different ways. In this journey he shows the difference between the two as the difference between the narrator's Classical outlook and that of the Sutherland's Romantic one.<br />John and Sylvia both enjoy the look and feel of riding a motorcycle, but despise the mechanical chores of keeping it functioning at top proficiency. John is proud of his shiny, new and very expensive BMW motorcycle, but can't get into the daily maintenance of it. Phaedrus, on the other hand, is primarily attracted to and focused on the underlying form of the motorcycle. He is fascinated with how it works and what causes it to break down. Phaedrus is interested in the mechanics of the bike because he wants to minimize its weaknesses and maximize its effectiveness. The Sutherland's just want to ride, and to avoid at all costs the mechanics of the thing because that's what they're on vacation for - to get away from the mechanistic world.<br />This Classic/Romantic split is important today because it explains all of our contemporary socio-political schisms so well. Emotional thinking is always Romantic, while pragmatic or logical thinking is always Classical. Both sides see only one true way of looking atthings and both overlook an important part of the puzzle of life.<br />It's why so many Leftists wear the \\"bleeding heart liberal\\" tag as a badge of honor. It feeds their emotionalism. Anything that sounds compassionate, feels good or \\"helps people,\\" is, to their form based thinking, \\"good,\\" and people who espouse self-reliance and individual responsibility are, in their view, \\"mean-spirited, Social Darwinists and well...evil\\" On the other hand, that's why economic Libertarians and social conservatives see \\"do-gooder liberals\\" as \\"grossly misguided dupes who care nothing for helping people help themselves and as well...evil.\\"<br />It's why, Romantic thinkers rarely use facts. They support their positions on what \\"feels right,\\" or \\"fair.\\" It's also why, when emotional Leftists are confronted with facts they don't like, they interpret the data as \\"angry\\" or \\"argumentative.\\" This also explains why Classical thinking Libertarians and Romantic thinking Leftists don't communicate. Classicists deal in pragmatics and facts, while Romantics deal in feelings and appearances.<br />What Pirsig does, is synthesize both Classical and Romantic components into a sort of \\"unified field theory\\" of living. He offers a vision of a complete whole - a fusion of logic and emotion, form and function. An ideal whole that we're still very far from. An ideal that cost his narrator, Phaedrus, dearly.<br />Upon reaching Montana, the Sutherland's split and head south, while the narrator and his son head on toward Bozeman, the College town in which the narrator's former self (Phaedrus) taught. As they get closer to Bozeman, the pull of the narrator's former self (Phaedrus) grows stronger and he begins reliving some of the philosophical questions that had brought Phaedrus to the brink of emotional breakdown.<br />The entire book becomes a journey of self-discovery in which the reader comes along for a ride. As the narrator gets in touch with the questions and pursuits of his former life, he realizes that, in order to connect with his son, Chris, he must first confront his former self (Phaedrus).

I thought John Berendt did a very good job of weaving a rich tapestry of eccentric characters and a fascinating setting, into an original true crime story. The book is based on an actual murder that set the precedent for OJ Simpson's defense, that is challenging the police and Medical Examiner's handling of the crime scene evidence.<br />Berendt spent eight years in Savannah, researching the book that originally started out as an article and it shows! In fact, maybe it shows too much...that is, what I gather, most of his critics have a problem with - INFO DUMP. Berendt does give reams of background material, but I never found it slow going. After reading this book you could picture Savannah and Berendt spun the same kinds of word pictures of each character. You'd swear you knew them all after reading this book.<br />Jim Williams, a wealthy antiques and collectibles dealer, was charged with the murder of his live-in assistant (and part time male prostitute) Danny Hansford and the trial set off a local firestorm.<br />As in the OJ case there were no witnesses - Williams charged self-defense, the prosecutor charged murder and the case went to trial...FOUR TIMES!<br />The original sticking point was the total lack of gun powder residue on Danny Hansford's hands, indicating that he never fired a gun and that Williams may have simply murdered him. Throughout the trials, Williams maintains his innocence as the prosecutor builds more and more circumstantial evidence that shows increasing animosity between Williams and Hansford, Hansford's wild demeanor and bad temper.<br />In one trial, a single juror, a woman who'd had to defend herself against a violent ex-husband, held out for acquittal, resulting in another hung jury. The fourth trial was moved to Augusta, Georgia - \\"the heart of the Bible Belt,\\" where the homosexual overtones where not expected to play very well. In Berendt's story, Jim Williams begins telling him how Danny grabbed a gun in which the firing pin had been filed down and Williams reached into his desk for his own gun and fired, fearing the younger man's rage. But Williams lawyer comes in with a blockbuster piece of evidence - neither the police at the scene, nor the hospital staff had bagged Danny Hansford's hands at the scene. In fact, they'd been bagged with plastic bags, which would allow any gun powder residue to be washed away by the condensation. Williams was off the hook!<br />The book is a fascinating murder mystery, set in a fascinating town, with an array of exotic characters. There's Minerva, the voodoo princess, who helps Jim Williams commune with Danny dead spirit. Joe Odom is the house squatting, local entrepreneur. Lady Chablis (Frank) is a black transvestite who puts on burlesque shows at some of the local venues. There's even a man who walks the leash of a dog that died years ago, in order to keep receiving the $25/week for walking his late bosses pet.<br />This book is certainly worth reading if only to see the way our legal process actually works. Just as in the OJ case, money appears to triumph over justice in the end. But what else is new? When or where has it been otherwise? After spending nearly two years on the hardcover bestseller list, I guess most folks have read this...if you haven't, by all means check it out. It's a very well crafted read.n filed down and Williams reached into his desk for his own gun and fired, fearing the younger man's rage.

Williams and syndicated columnist Tom Sowell. Like his cohorts, Elder rails against the \\"cult of victimology\\" which strangles the advancement of all who subscribe to it.<br />To be sure, it's a controversial book - like much Libertarian rhetoric, it runs counter to what so many people \\"think they know.\\" If you've found yourself a \\"reluctant Republican,\\" Larry Elder's chapter \\"Maybe a Dimes Worth of Difference\\" will explain why. As he states, \\"The difference between a Republican and a Libertarian is massive. The difference between a Democrat and a Libertarian is gargantuan. Libertarians believe people are smart enough, wise enough, mature enough and capable enough to manage their own affairs to the fullest extent possible.\\"<br />It's an interesting take, though most Libertarians who've voted Republican can point to tons of bitter disappointments, like the '94 Republicans who ran on \\"term limits\\" and abandoned them once in office, Moderate Republicans pushing for welfare reform, while continuing corporate welfare and many more. Still, Elder is right that only the GOP has even mouthed support for Constitutional limits on government and severe restrictions on federal spending. Most Democrats seem to believe that much of the Constitution is outdated and ineffectual.<br />Elder proposes a ten point Libertarian agenda which includes abolishing the IRS and replacing the Income Tax with a National Retail Sales Tax, reducing government spending by 80%, abolishing the Davis-Bacon Act, removing the government from education, legalizing/decriminalizing drugs, abolishing the minimum wage, eliminating Corporate Taxes (there are no such things as \\"corporate taxes\\" because these taxes are passed on to us as consumers), ending welfare entitlements and special privileges, getting the government out of the charity industry (an idea that Marvin Olasky has written extensively about in \\"The Tragedy of American Compassion\\") and ending protectionism.<br />One of Elder's contentions that draws considerable ire from many people is that \\"there is no health car crisis.\\" Nobel Laureate, Milton Friedman would be proud. Friedman has argued for decades that it is medical insurance itself that has driven up the costs of health care. Health care, like plumbing and carpentry, is a commodity supplied by human skill and effort. If insurance didn't mask the cost of care, we'd all be better health care consumers and the price of this commodity would reflect that. After all, any commodity is worth only what the market will bear.<br />What insurance does is to distribute the existing commodity and charge the consumer indirectly, either in lieu of wages (when \\"given\\" at work), or through higher taxes and/or rationing when delivered through government. In fact, the costs of \\"insured\\" health care are always higher because the middleman (the insurer) always adds in his own \\"costs\\" to the mix.<br />Elder puts it, \\"The natural laws of supply and demand don't work in health care, precisely because government has intruded...distorting incentives along the way.\\" He is, of course, right. One of the inane platitudes of socialism is that since, health care, food and housing are all necessary to our survival, they are all \\"basic human rights.\\" That's a nice, but dumb way of justifying chattel slavery, because if commodities like food, housing and medical care are \\"rights,\\" than those who produce these \\"rights\\" must be enslaved or controlled. If they don't produce enough, they must be forced to be more productive, if their costs run too high, they must be compelled to offer these commodities at or below their own cost, if necessary. Slavery, the control of one human for the benefit or delight of another, is always wrong, even, maybe especially when it benefits \\"the greater good.\\"<br />Elder offers perhaps one of his most controversial views in his opening chapter, \\"Blacks Are More Racist Than Whites.\\" Growing up, I played on a number of basketball teams that were predominantly black. I can attest to the observation that blacks do tend to be more \\"color conscious\\" than whites, but that, in and of itself, isn't bigotry. For instance, after one summer league game in which I enjoyed a match-up advantage over the guy guarding me, allowing me to take and make a lot of open shots, I was given the compliment, \\"I never saw a white guy play that good!\\" Was that \\"racist?\\" I don't think so, because it was said without malice. It struck me as being incongruous with my own experiences - two of the three toughest covers for me in this league happened to be white. But that doesn't mean my reality was his. Maybe he matched up better against those players than I did.<br />The point is that in my own experience I've found overt bigotry to be rare in virtually every group I've come across. Still, Larry Elder gives his own examples; Spike Lee saying, \\"I give interracial couples a look. Daggers. They get uncomfortable when they see me on the street.\\" Or California State Senator Diane Watson's attack on Ward Connerly, \\"He's married to a white woman. He wants to be white. He wants a colorless society. He has no ethnic pride. He don't want to be black.\\" Or USA Columnist Julianne Malveaux's expressed hope that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' wife feed him \\"lots of eggs and butter and he dies early...of heart disease.\\"<br />Elder has an engaging writing style and his points are all meticulously backed up with cogent arguments. \\"The Ten Things You Can't Say in America\\" will be an eye opening read for any open-minded Democrats and Moderate Republicans who might come across it - for Libertarians, it's an enjoyable sermon to the choir.es at or below their own cost, if necessary.

Frank McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; was a tremendous inside look at a childhood filled with tragedy and its overcoming, in this book he chronicles the greatest single tragedy in the FDNY's history - 343 firemen killed in the line-of-duty during the attacks on New York's World Trade Centers.<br />The prose is poetic and the pictures are poignant. It is a well crafted tribute to all those who made sacrifices on that day and during the grim days directly after 9/11/01.<br />I've been a NYC firefighter for over sixteen years (I work in the South Bronx) and the Fire Department is indeed and hopefully always will be a BROTHERHOOD. Firemen routinely refer to each other as &quot;Brothers,&quot; as in &quot;brother firemen.&quot; If that offends some people that offense is misplaced. There are currently less than thirty active female firefighters in the 10,000 member FDNY. There were no women who responded to the World Trade Centers on the eleventh. That's why there were no female firefighters among the 343 killed...and thank God.<br />The Fire Service is not a job conducive to the vast majority of women. The job is not just filthy, brutal and dangerous, but given the wide gap in upper body strength between men and women, only a handful of women are up to the rigors of the job. Those women who do get into the FDNY must be prepared to join the &quot;Brotherhood.&quot;<br />Still, the point is that the title here is entirely appropriate, especially in light of those who made the supreme sacrifice that day. This is an excellent book and one well worth reading, especially for those who didn't get a first-hand look at Ground Zero.	2002-04-04

Harvard Law Professor Derrick Bell's book, Faces At the Bottom of the Well defines America's racial divide in terms of the book's subtitle; &quot;The Permanence of Racism&quot;. Throughout the book, he uses fictional settings to illustrate his theory.<br />Derrick Bell was a controversial professor at Harvard Law, until he left over the school's refusal to hire a black female law professor. Harvard argued that other applicants had much stronger backgrounds and credentials, but Bell, a strong proponent of race based preferences, claimed that &quot;diversity considerations&quot; outweighed any &quot;purely academic requirements.&quot;<br />After leaving Harvard, Bell was subsequently hired by NYU's Law School, where he continues his dual career as law professor and writer/activist.<br />Two of Bell's most vivid fictions involve blackmailing Space Aliens and a fictional land call Afrolantica. In the first scenario, the Aliens demand that all the blacks in America be handed over to them, so that they can be taken back to their planet. They refuse to divulge what they intend to do with America's black citizens. In exchange the remaining Americans will be given enough gold to eliminate taxes for a year and the technology needed to eradicate all of the effects of pollution. There is also the hint of violence if America's blacks aren't turned over.<br />In the second scenario, a fantasy about a fictional land called &quot;Afrolantica,&quot; an island upon which only black people can survive and where white people can't even breathe, starts a controversy. Some blacks argue that all American blacks should move there and start their own nation, many whites support that plan.<br />Bell asks some interesting questions with this book, &quot;How deep are the ties that bind us a nation?&quot;...&quot;How close to the surface are our grievances and distrusts?&quot;<br />The problem with Bell's thesis is that it is limited by its complete one-sidedness. To Bell an Irish-American who seeks to live in a predominantly Irish neighborhood, or a Chinese-American who decides to reside in China Town, NYC are suspected &quot;racists,&quot; while a black-American who chooses to reside in Harlem is not.<br />Contrary to Bell's assertions, the fact that most people identify with one ethnic group or another is merely a fact, not an indictment. That many people feel more comfortable among people more &quot;like them&quot; than not, is not an indictment either. What Derrick Bell is most guilty of is &quot;Special Pleading&quot; or perceiving anything that benefits &quot;his side&quot; or his point of view, as &quot;good&quot; and all that runs counter to that, &quot;bad.&quot; As a result his writing takes on a harsh and bitter tone that often makes him appear as guilty of the bigotry he condemns in others.<br />If Bell's intention was to use the image of &quot;the well&quot; as a mirror, in order to force his readers to examine the racism that continues to exist, he has failed, because his own bitterness colors his arguments with decidedly racist observations and attitudes.<br />Bells' strength lies in asking questions, his weakness is that he offers no answers and in fact accepts the inevitability of racism. His writing pales in comparison to other contemporary scholars who've dealt with the isue of race in America, such as Thomas Sowell and Walter E Williams.seeks to live in a predominantly Irish neighborhood, or a Chinese-American who decides to reside in China Town, NYC are suspected &quot;racists,&quot; while a black-American who chooses to reside in Harlem is not.<br />Contrary to Bell's assertions, the fact that most people identify with one ethnic group or another is merely a fact, not an indictment.

Bernard Goldberg notes that the mainstream news (ABC, CBS & NBC) all tend to love whistleblowers....So long as they're not media insider whistleblowers.<br />Throughout \\"Bias,\\" Goldberg gives countless examples of media distortion and bias and wonders, where the Edward R Murrow doctrine of reporting the facts WITHOUT personal opinion or \\"our slant\\" went.<br />According to Mr. Goldberg, his fortunes at CBS changed drastically after he wrote an Op Ed piece, which appeared in the Wall Street Journal, criticizing colleague Eric Engberg's dersion of Steve Forbes' Flat Tax plan. The same flat tax recently adopted by Russia, a nation that keeps moving further and further from its socialist roots.<br />Bernard Goldberg holds a mirror up to the mainstream media and it's not surprising that they don't much like what they see. The \\"Left-wing bias\\" charge has been around for decades and though some, like Dan Rather deny it, others, like Peter Jennings have, in recent years admitted that \\"conservative voices in the mainstream media are few and far between.\\" I suspect that his confirming this charge is not what really angers his peers, it's his exposing the blatant hypocrisy of the media elites that has them as mad as a bunch of wet hornets.<br />He tells of news people seeking out blue eyed blondes when doing stories on Aids and homelessness because they fear that upper income whites (their target audience) won't relate to these stories if the faces are predominatly black, Hispanic or Asian.<br />...<br />Ironically enough, those same people who champion \\"diversity\\" seem to cringe when it comes to ideological diversity. Goldberg notes John Stossel as the lone Libertarian (and thus \\"right-of-center\\") voice on ABC News. This observation is made by a self-proclaimed \\"Kennedy Liberal,\\" as Goldberg professes to favor both gay rights and abortion and says he voted against Ronald Reagan twice.<br />Bernard Goldberg mentions how one CBS producer casually referred to Gary Bauer of the Christian Coalition as \\"That little nut from that Christian group.\\" He also noted that no one in that room would've dared call Jesse Jackson \\"That big nut from that black group,\\" or Dov Hikind \\"That right-wing nut from that Jewish group.\\" But we've all seen examples of that, even if we don't choose to notice it. Just look at how the mainstram media heaps praise upon the cackling likes of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson while ridiculing eleoquent and erudite black scholars like Thomas Sowell and Walter E Williams. Black conservatives like Emanuel McLittle (of Destiny Magazine) and Ken Hamblin (Radio Talk Show Host) fare little better as they are routinely excoriated more roundly than are out and out racial haters like the late Khalid Mohammed and New Black Panther Party leader Quannel X.<br />\\"Bias\\" has given the media a gift of the mirror he holds up to it. Since the eighties AM Talk Radio has cut into the viewership of television news and with the advent of Cable news, specifically Fox News, the market share that ABC, CBS and NBC all enjoyed has markedly diminished. For those who insist that ideology has no part of this shift, consider that no Liberal Radio Talk Show Host has ever enjoyed the ratings success that their conservative counterparts have, and that MSNBC and CNN have recently both been scrambling for \\"conservative voices\\" - Alan Keyes has joined MSNBC and CNN stole Paula Zahn from Fox News early in 2002.<br />Bernard Goldberg's book is filled with tons of fascinating anecdotal tales and personal accounts of what goes on behind the scenes in network news. There are a few editorial glitches here and there, but the book itself is a riveting read that really delivers what it promises.ristian Coalition as \\"That little nut from that Christian group.\\" He also noted that no one in that room would've dared call Jesse Jackson \\"That big nut from that black group,\\" or Dov Hikind \\"That right-wing nut from that Jewish group.\\" But we've all seen examples of that, even if we don't choose to notice it.

Just as it seems Ada is about to lose it all, a tenacious and wily drifter named Ruby appears to help her out. Ruby and Ada compliment each other perfectly, not only is Ruby as practical as Ada is a dreamer, they combine to produce all the skills needed to keep the place going.<br />While the Cold Mountain homefront gradually improves, Inman's odyssey keeps on getting more and more tenuous as it moves toward Inman's final confrontation with the homeguard.<br />I thought Frazier did a great job of recreating the brutal conditions that accompanied the Civil War. His writing's crisp and clear and his descriptions are vivid.	2002-03-31

Mitch Albom's 1997 book Tuesday's With Morrie has become an instant classic and for good reason. The story chronicles Albom's belated reunion with a favorite college professor, Morrie Schwartz who was dying of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) in 1994. The reunion was sparked by an interview Morrie did with Nightline, while a strike at Albom's Detroit newspaper freed up his time.<br />Seeing his old professor suffering the ravages of ALS convinced Albom to visit him weekly (every Tuesday) to finish \\"his final thesis\\" with Morrie. Their \\"last course\\" is about the meaning of life, from the perspective of a dying man. Morrie lets Albom and the rest of us in on what's ultimately important in life and it's unfortunately not the things majority of us spend most of our time on.<br />Morrie is without self pity, but openly shares his pains and his losses as his world shrinks before Mitch Albom's eyes. The old professor talks openly about both the things he misses and of those things that are most important in life, cultivating love and friendships, enjoying yourself (Morrie loved to dance) and appreciating the beauty all around us.<br />As the weeks go by, Morrie's disease moves up his body, starting at his feet, than his legs and upward. One of the indignities that Morrie fears most is \\"the [fanny] wipe test,\\"...After that it'll be my ability to talk and finally my ability to breathe...I'll suffocate.\\"<br />With every visit, Morrie explained to Albom how far the disease had spread and used subtle tricks to help his student show affection. They talked a wide range of subjects, from money, to marriage, to our culture and death itself. Some of the lessons may seem almost obvious, even simplistic, but if they were so obvious, everyone would be living a balanced life.<br />In one meeting, Morrie explains how he got through it all, by experiencing each emotion, then letting it go. \\"There are mornings that I cry about all the things I've lost, but then I step back and say, `So, this is grief,\\" and I feel it, then let it go and move on to other emotions.\\"<br />On his last visit, Morrie spoke only with great effort and Albom was faced with giving up any hope of the miraculous. He looked at the struggling old teacher, he referred to as \\"coach\\" and said,<br />\\"I don't know how to say goodbye.\\"<br />Morrie held his student's hand and pressed it close to his heaving chest and replied,<br />\\"This...is...how we...say...goodbye.\\"<br />Albom observed a snort from his old teacher over an apparent final triumph - Morrie had finally gotten him to cry.<br />Through Albom's words, Morrie Schwartz left us all a great gift...a pathway to a fuller and more meaningful life.grief,\\" and I feel it, then let it go and move on to other emotions.\\"<br />On his last visit, Morrie spoke only with great effort and Albom was faced with giving up any hope of the miraculous.
