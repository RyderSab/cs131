Puck is a no-nonsense chef, and this is a no-nonsense cookbook that will allow you to create some quite stunning dishes. I have always found it clear and well-written, the recipes are easy to follow, and with good results. This cookbook is not meant for the beginner, if you need pictures with your instructions, do not bother. This is also not one of these all-inlcusive how to cook everything under the sun books but rather a recipe collection that is meant to introduce the educated enthusiast to this style of cooking. You will take away new techniques and a broadended palate.	2004-04-02

One of his trademarks is that he gives this extremely technical sport a very human perspective. This is transparent in every driver portrait or scene shot from the track. The 1970s were a decade of aggressive technical development in F1 which led to some of the most spectacular (Lotus 72) and bizarre (Tyrrel 6-wheeler and Brabham fan car)cars ever. It was a decade of triumph and tragedy with the loss of some of the sport's best drivers like Jochen Rindt and Ronnie Peterson, and of course there was Niki Lauda's terrible fire accident at the Nuerburgring. Schlegelmilch covers all of this with insight and brilliance, focusing not only on the highlights and the stars, but the sport as as whole. The prints are superb, text and  picture captions are concise but informative	2004-02-16

If you are a well-practiced mystery reader you are undoubtedly going to figure out some aspects of the extremely convoluted plot, since the build-up to some of the conclusions is just too elaborately crafted. But the author executes this so well that you actually don't mind. For parts of the book Goodman walks the very fine line between romantic drama and second-rate kitsch, but she always gets away with it because of her classy writing and overall exquisite and non-cheesy character development. Jane Hudson, her heroine latin teacher who returns to her old school to relive the horrors of adolescence is a slightly jaded and thus intensely likeable character. Her set of school teachers at Heart Lake made me chuckle more than once, and anybody who has ever had latin in school for extended periods of time and liked it will love the pangs of nostalgia that will be inevitable when reading this book. It is really hard to categorize this novel as a typical mystery. It is a coming-of-age story as much as a romance and a dark, atmospherically very dense gothic tale. An addictive guilty pleasure.	2003-11-25

At the center of the series Brunetti is an intensely likeable, complex and believable character, and this craftsmanship of characters is true for the whole book. A famous maestro is murdered at the Venice opera house and behind the facade of a near-perfect public figure Brunettti begins to find and fear some very dark and intriguing aspects of the maestros life that are &quot;molto agitato&quot; and shocking. The storyline is very inventive, yet not contrived. What sets Leon apart from many other American writers trying their hand at European scenarios is that she really understands her location and the culture very well. Her backdrops and storylines are well-researched and full of athmospheric density. A great read that will get you hooked for more	2003-10-20

As a long-time Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta fan I am shocked to see the series drop to this very sad level of quality. After a disappointing &quot;Black Notice&quot; when the questionable wolfman Chandonne was introduced, Cornwell raised herself almost to her old level of writing in &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;, but now she seems to completely have hit rock bottom. The story is predictable from page 1 and I had to gasp when I saw that she indeed resurrected Benton Wesley! How unbelievable yet cheesily predictable is that? And Lucy and Marino knew all along he was still alive? I don't think so! It seems to be more like: we have run out personal storyline for Kay after her last lover turned out to be serial killer, so let's resurrect the lost love of her life! None of the characters, including Kay in this book, come across as remotely sympathetic or believable: Lucy is more neurotic than ever, and after being wunderkind computer whiz, turned problematic law enforceress, turned alcoholic, turned highly problematic self-employed private investigator, she is now going around executing people herself. On the note of Lucy's European execution adventure: the European portions of this novel are extremely poorly written and make you wonder if Ms. Cornwell has ever visited Germany or Poland. At least one would assume that a writer of her notoriety can afford a foreign language editor and not let a book go to print with emberrassingly poor and wrong German phrases (I am a native German, trust me: it's bad). Marino and Wesley in this book have nothing in common with the carefully crafted, believable characters that they were in earlier novels, Marino is just alltogether pityful and disgusting, and Wesley is totally weird. Sadly they drive this book more than the Scarpetta character who in the first half of the book seems a mere cameo appearance. The book dwells so much on the past and innuendo from previous stories that the present storyline never develops any of the strenght, pace, or complicated density that were the hallmarks of the earlier Scarpetta books. The book is made up of over 100 miniature chapters, some of them barely 3 pages long, and in parts the dialogue and storyline are so poorly coherent and sketchy that you have to go back and re-read portions to stay with the action. Overall a very sad and poor effort!ce, or complicated density that were the hallmarks of the earlier Scarpetta books.

He also returns to the great character of Constance Rattigan, aging Hollywood diva, who was introduced in the superb \\"Death is a lonely business\\". In the current story Constance once again finds herself haunted by her Hollywood past as she finds an old phonebook at her door in which some of the names seem to be marked for death, the last survivors of her past apparently picked to die, her name labeled as well. So she runs to our narrator, nameless writer on the beach, and gets him and his trusted, grumpy sidekick Crumley into yet another adventure that explores the dark shadows of a Hollywood that is no more.

This book is for all of us who miss his charismatic, knowledgable and breathless commentary of all things motorsport, but particularly Formula One. A national institution in Britain, Murray Walker was the voice of Formula One first on the BBC and later on ITV, and the sale of television feed globally made him known throughout the world. When he retired at the US Grand Prix at Indianapolis in 2001 he left millions of fans sad to see him go. His autobiography comes as a concentrated dose of Murray that will make you laugh out loud many times but will also let you pause at marvel at a life so full of wonderul experiences. The real meat on F1 starts about halfway through the book, but racing fanatics: don't spring forward and miss the fantastic account of Murray's childhood, his introduction to motorsports and broadcasting by his motorcycling enthusiast father and his account of his WWII experience. The book is a thoroughly entertaining read and an absolute must for every motorsport fan.	2002-12-26

Henry Pierce lives in the sheltered subculture of a high tech start-up, a whiz kid with an unusual past.

While the \\"Bourne Supremacy\\" was clearly off the pace of the series' first book, this last one has it all. After going off on an Asian advneture/nightmare in Book 2, the third installment now brings Jason Bourne/David Webb to the ultimate showdown with his nemesis Carlos the Jackal. But don't fool yourself that this is a straightforward kind of deal: Medusa is raising its ugly head again as well, this dark chapter in Bourne's past having taken on a new manifestation in an even more dangerous form. Of course Bourne/Webb does not go hunting alone, his courageous wife as well as Mo Panov and Alex Conklin add their usual character color to this well conceived page turner. Once again the character of David Webb/Jason Bourne as the tormented split identity is exquisitely drawn and is not run thin by the breackneck pace of the globe-spanning action.<br />A must-read and very gratifying end to one of the best spy/suspense trilogies there is!	2002-10-16

Again the government needs his help as Jason Bourne or Delta, the man from Medusa and Threadstone 71. Knowing that he will not volunteer his help after all that CIA and State Department have done to him, a story is rigged and his wife is kidnapped. Webb snaps and in the desired effect is on his way to Asia to track a Bourne-impostor who is killing highly-placed officials in Kowloon and Hong Kong. Things run off the wire when Bourne's wife escapes her custody and finds help at the Canadian consulate from an old friend.<br />While the whole story is as action-packed and twisted as the first installment of the Bourne trilogy, it is a little bit harder to get into at the beginning and seems overall a bit more constured. Ludlum is a master of complicated scenarios and he moves about his many locations and characters with ease and skill. He storylines are well-drawn and compelling, but in direct comparison the book is no match to its pre-decessor.	2002-04-29

What we learn from this book is that he already had that gift when he was still driving! The book was made in 1998 when Damon was on his last F1 stint with the Jordan team, during that emotional year when Jordan scored a historic 1-2 in Spa. The F1-educated reader who knows what happened in '99 (Damon fired by Eddie Jordan because he was consistently outperformed by team-mate Heinz-Harald Frentzen) will find his remarks on the team a poignant read.<br />The book touches all the major aspects of Formula One motorsport: technology, image, media pressure, professional rivalry, the fear, money and fame. Damon also talks about his famous father Graham Hill and &quot;his&quot; race: Monte Carlo (GH won Monte Carlo 5 times and was only fairly recently surpassed by Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher in this feat). Damon explores how having a famous race driver as a father influenced his own career path and attitude towards the sport.<br />The book is overall very well crafted. Damon's text is supported and enhanced by the superb photography of Keith Sutton, England's premier F1 photographer. Overall a very good read and a pleasure to the eye, certainly a must-have for every serious F1-fan, even you Schumacher fans: Damon has some very interesting things to say about his famous rivalry with Michael!	2002-04-04

Nigel McKnight does a very good job, though. This is a superbly readable guide through the heart of F1 technology and while this sport technologically evolves so incredibly fast that it is hard to publish on it in a book format, this book gives you a solid background, even though the technology discussed in it is now outdated by about 4 years. F1 technology is a lot about design and engineering concepts that are evolving with the ever-changing rule-environment and challenges created by the sport's governing body, the FIA, and this book gets you into these concepts and the minds of the best designers in the sport.<br />I hope an updated version of this book will be available soon!	2002-04-04

OK, the author covers all the major rivalries of the sport and the basic stories behind them, starting with Fangio and Moss in the 50s, all the way up to Hill vs. Schumacher in the 90ies. But considering some of the most sizzling temper-clashes on track, like Senna vs Prost, the book comes off pretty lame. The photography is OK, but not superb, and that is another letdown, considering that this is a coffee-table size book that is seeking balance between pictures and words. If you are a fan, it completes your collection, but don't go out of your way to find this. I recommend finding it used.	2002-03-28

Fascinated with food since childhood she picked up many things in her family's professionally run large kitchen. Exiled to France her kitchen skills became the survival line for the entire family when she opened her first restaurant. In France her cuisine picked up a European twist while staying truely Cambodian at the same time. As Longteine tells her story, she introduces us to her favorite dishes from the restaurant and teaches us about the many exotic ingredients that flavor her country's food.

Not new material at all: a love-triangle, a friendship that is challenged by disaster and love for the same woman, the adversities of life and finally fate working in a good way after all.<br />Since the &quot;horse-whisperer&quot; we know that Mr. Evans is a solid story-teller and takes his time to develop the lead characters. For this he spends the first half of the story on the beginnings of Ed's and Connor's friendship as smoke jumpers in Montana. At the same time he introduces us to Julia who is the central love interest. After a climactic forest fire there is a scissure in the story that I believe is well-placed. Just as the lives of these 3 people are changed dramatically, so are the pace and the main storylines of the book. Evans pulls this off, though, because his characters and settings are well-developed by his groundwork in the first half of the novel.<br />The book is an overall very good weekend, page-turner read.<br />Less one star for it is predictable after all.	2002-01-29

What is really engaging in the series is the character of Kinsey Milhone, private eye, who is the heroine. She is a down-to-earth, slightly jaded female who has her quirks, habits and a reasonably tough time surviving her dayjob. In the first book her character is still evolving, and we have to give Sue Grafton credit for getting a really strong start on that. Similar to Kay Scarpetta, Patricia Cornwell's great suspense heroine, Kinsey's persona is crafted in a subtle and realistic fashion that makes the reader relate to her quickly. The plot of this first mystery is solid, but not brilliant and any habitual suspense ready will get a grip on who the bad guy may be before it is all over. So don't expect any fireworks in that direction. But the book still leaves the reader mostly satisfied and craving to hear more about Kinsey. I like to think of her as a female, modern day Philip Marlow because in more than one way her slightly rough and introverted personality seem to borrow from the great Hammet character.	2001-07-13

His characters are well-drawn and the concept of the book is immediately highly intriguing.<br />Oxford student Ben Ashurst is your average Oxford student who leeds a fairly uneventful life all the way down to his fairly dull girl friend Jenni. Trying to keep up with the ritzier and glitzier crowd in town he attends the parties of his aquaintance Pierce who leeds the life of a rich dandy. When the exotic and very attractive Cara turns up at one of these events, Ben is smitten and drawn into a stream of events that soon is beyond his control. To gain Cara's interest he tells her about an exciting emotions study that his tutor, Professor Fieldhead is planning, and for which he refused to be the guinea pig. In no time Cara has changed his mind and the two of them are on a plane to Africa, courtesy of Dr. Fieldhead and the research on his breakthrough emotion sensor. But what starts as an apparent dream holiday in a paradise resort to study the somatic responses to pleasure, very soon turns into a shocking nightmare for Ben, as he finds himself caught in a cobweb of lies and paranoia.<br />The storyline of the book is very imaginative and well thought-out, impossible to figure out even for the seasoned suspense buff. Every time you think you know what will happen, there is a well-designed twist, and the author effortlessly keeps you going to the highly entertaining conclusion.<br />A very enjoyable book and an impressive debut for a young author.

This wonderful black-and-white picture epitomizes this whole book of motor racing portraits from the 60ies. Schlegelmilch is the man for the job. He has followed F1 since the early sixties, he has witnessed triumphs and tragedies and has always been able to portrait the human side of this high-pace, high-glitz and high-tech sport. The sixties saw incredible technical advancements in motor-racing, but these advancements sometimes came at a terrible price. It was also a decade where some of the greatest drivers of all time left their mark on the sport, like Jim Clark and Jackie Stewart. Schlegelmilch is the master of natural light and so many times has been able to capture that special moment, gesture or expression in a driver's face that says more than a 1000 words. Even if you are not an F1 or racing fan, this book presents black-and-wite portrait photography at the highest level and is a joy to look at.	2001-04-25

A lot of the recipes in this cookbook are very easy, so this is a great beginners' book, many of them rely on premade or canned stuff, which bothers me a bit as a buy-and-make-fresh-purist, but especially for the beginner cook on a shoestring budget, there are many good recipes.  The cookbook has no pictures that are recipe-related, but the instructions are generally phrased very well. Some of the more elaborate ones do require some experience and knowledge - I know that a friend of mine had some trouble reproducing the custard, never having made a custard before.	2001-03-21

Many local and international dignitaries/celebreties have contributed recipes, but also just many Washington locals. There are many international recipes, stemming from the different embassies present in DC, but also many all-American standards. I love cookbooks that have been compiled like this, because people have sent in their best, tried and true favorite recipes. And they work. I have owned this book for many years now and have not been disappointed by a single recipe. I have more recently purchased volume II, and it is equally great. Maybe because several of the contributers are used to entertaining at a grander scale, there are many great &quot;crowd-pleaser&quot; recipes in there that will happily feed even the hungriest party.  The cookbook is not made up in a glossy way at all, and it has no recipe-related photos, so picture-oriented beginner cooks beware! However, I have found all the recipes so far very well written, edited, and easy to reproduce. In my opinion: no pictures necessary.	2001-03-21

He reminds me in many ways of his Israeli counterpart Miachael Ohayon, created by the great mystery writer Batya Gur. But of course Sweden is very different from Israel and the small town of Ystad is no Jerusalem. When two gruesome murders happen in the small community, Kurt Wallander is immediately torn out of reminiscences from his recent Italy vacation with his father and has to immerse himself in a strange and very dark reality. At the same time the reader follows the steps of the killer and sees a complex personality and story build as a race against time heats up for the Ystad police.  The novel is well-written, atmospherically dense, intense and keeps a good pace all the way to the well-developed conclusion. Mankell has no loose ends remaining at the end of this story, yet the reader is sad to say farewell to Kurt once more.	2001-02-28

There are a lot of aspects to stock options as a form of compensation that are very complicated and not easily understood by the lay erson. One of these aspects is alternative minimum tax. This is the first book I have found that explains the ins and outs of this devious little tax problem. The book is overall well written and extremely well organized so you can jump right to a specific subject, cross-read and go on to other aspects that are referenced. The book also talks about strategic use of options, long-term investing etc., things one should hear as a second opinion from somebody other than the stockbroker who is in charge of your account. If you have started in a company that offers stock options as part of your compensation, get this book, learn and benefit.	2001-02-12

After &quot;Blood Work&quot;, which came to a very well-rounded and satisfying conclusion, a second McCaleb novel was definitely a surprise, a positive one at that. &quot;A darkness more than night&quot; is a superb book. Connelly's writing is right up there with the great classics of the genre. Although his stories take place in modern day Los Angeles, they have a noir touch to them that reminds us of the Philip Marlowe stories.<br />In this book Terry McCaleb crosses paths with Harry Bosch, star of several Connelly novels, most recently &quot;Angel's flight&quot;. Without giving away too many clues it is safe to say that a very captivating story develops as personalities collide and two seemingly unrelated investigations enter a web of darkness. As in &quot;Bloodwork&quot; the reader follows breathlessly and until the very end is unable to figure out where this tale is heading. Believable, well-drawn characters, great storyline, athmosperically dense writing, great book!	2001-02-02

The texts are well-compiled and edited. Especially for people who are just moving into the field of mass spec, as many proteomics people and biologists are these days, this is a useful book. The problem with technology these days is that it moves at a frightening pace and that the literature has a very hard time keeping up with the latest advancements. This is especially true in the area of biosciences and the instrumentation in use there.  This volume was put together in 1990, and since then many new developments have revolutionized the use of mass spectrometry especially for biological and medical research, and those of course are missing here. Having said that: what this volume offers instead is a good coverage of many, many very valuable basics that every mass spectrometrist should be familiar with. The chapters are written by the best in the field, and the referncing is thorough and extensive. Like in all volumes of &quot;Methods in Enzymology&quot; figures are on the sparse side and the overall layout is a bit old-fashioned. With some trade-offs an overall valuable book that hopefully will go into an updated edition soon.	2001-02-01

She puts a lot of work into creating a complex and rich historical as well as atmospheric background for her lead characters. And she does it quite well for characters from foreign cultural background: the main character in &quot;Perfect Harmony&quot; is Charlotte Lee, a young Chinese-American  woman. She is the CEO of Harmony Biotech, a biopharmaceutical company specializing in Chinese herbal medicine. As dramatic events unfold in present time and Charlotte sees her company, her professional existence and her life threatened, Wood unfolds the story of Charlotte's family and the history of the company in an equally engaging parallel storyline, and drama picks up on the mystery as well as the romantic level. Barbara Wood is the master of generation-spanning scenarios and great family sagas, as she has demonstrated before in her Egyptian tale  &quot;Virgins of Paradise&quot; and the Australian saga &quot;Dreamtime&quot;. Even when her sometimes a bit overly dramatic and predictably romantic heroines every once in a while come across as old-fashioned, this does not compromise the overall quality of her storytelling. Wood is a wonderful storyteller and is performing at her best in &quot;Perfect Harmony&quot;. Pick it up, kick off your shoes and don't plan anything else for the weekend.	2001-01-29

I have been a Stones fan for a long time and own several picture/coffee table books about them already, but I bought this book immediately after it was published in London. This volume has some of the greatest tour photography in it that I have ever seen. Only Annie Leibovitz' photo documentation of their 1975 American tour (some of it is included here)comes close to it. The book is a high quality production, both the color and the black and white images are very,very good. Do not buy this book for the text or a comprehensive road history of the Stones. That is the only weak point here (hence 4 and not 5 stars): the text, mostly quotes, is definitely weak. But there are other Stones books for that.  This book is for the seasoned fan who is excited about reliving some of the greatest concert moments in these wonderful pictures, some of which have never been published before.	2001-01-23

For one, it is very well written. It is equally well-researched, and although it talks about events that happened 90 years ago, every modern explorer or wanna-be explorer should read it. Huntford's book &quot;The last Place on Earth&quot; brilliantly reveals the true story of the race to the South Pole between Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott. In terms of Scott it is a myth-shattering account that tells the time-less story of arrogance, unpreparedness in the face of danger and lack of respect for the forces of nature that ultimately lead to inevitable desaster and failure. And if anybody thinks that this theme is outdated, please read the stories of the recent tragedies on Everest. Huntford analyzes very carefully the fundamentally different approaches that went into the preparation and execution of both expeditions and lead to the so different outcomes: success and safe return for the Norwegians, death and suffering for the British. Huntford finds the roots for Scott's arrogant and at the same time helpless approach in Edwardian society. He also shows us the very different situation that Amundsen was coming from. In spite of the large amount of detail presented, the book reads very, very well, almost like an adventure novel. Huntford has been criticized for his sharp bashing of Scott and his myth, but after reading the details and doing some further research on both expeditions I have to say that it was time that Amundsen got the full respect he deserved and the truth about Scott, the &quot;hero&quot; was told.	2001-01-22

But when a beautiful woman with a very interesting problem shows up at this home (boat, that is), he is drawn into a twisted swirl of events that leaves the reader breathless.

The Krakauer book leaves you both stunned and outraged (see my review), and while it is clearly very well written, it leaves many questions open. Boukreev's book answers a lot of these questions. Written with the intention of clearing his name, his account of the tragic events that engulfed the Mount Everest Expeditions of '96 comes across as very genuine and matter-of- fact. While it lacks Krakauer's slickness, it is still a very good and somehow more believable story. Krakauer was on a different expedition team than Boukreev, and while Krakauer's account is written as if he were part of all the expeditions that where up there and knew everything about them, Boukreev focuses on what went on with the Mountain Madness team that he was on.  The main information on the mountain events is translated from Boukreev's diary, and his co-author has Dewalt has filled in the connecting information. In spite of this patchwork style the book is very readable and has an authenticity to it that Krakauer's book is clearly lacking.	2001-01-17

This book starts off just as engaging and wraps the reader into a very complex plot that begins to span multiple European locations and intersting characters. The plot overall starts off very well designed and the main charcter of Paul Osborn in his personal quest to find answers to his father's murder 30 years ago comes across as quite  engaging. Also the character of McVey, the American policeman, is well drawn. The characters are definitely not the problem here, neither is it Folsom's ability to move through foreign and complex locations with ease. Their are well researched in their physical detail. The story really begins to disappoint when he starts to unfold the Nazi conspiracy and the whole plot moves to Germany. I am German and found his unrealistic, twisted and sad description of post-reunification Germany quite appaling. The inserted bits of German language are lame, inappropiate and in later parts mostly wrong. Germans don't speak like that! Most of all: we don't act like that!	2001-01-11

I enjoy Wagner, always have, but I know how difficult it is to initially get into his work without fear or prejudice. Berger's book is as entertaining as it is highly informative both for the Wagner novice and the seasoned afficionado. Like any good guide, the different chapters are independent and cross-readable, so you can pick up info on the different aspects of Wasgner and his music without having to go through the book chronologically. Berger has a very witty style and parts of the book are definitely written very tongue-in-cheek, which I personally appreciate. Very humorous for exmaple his observations on the different categories of Wagnerians to be observed attending an opera. Try picking them out during an intermission and you will be impressed with the authors perceptiveness! Beyond that, the book offers good, nuts-and-bolts advice (if there is such a thing in the area of music). Recently we had a staging of Parsifal here in Washington, featuring the great Placido Domingo. Parsifal is Wagner's last and longest opera, considered by many people to be the most complex, slow and boring. After reading Berger's summary and advice on tackling this piece, I had a thoroughly enjoyable time, and five hours melted down to nothing. With his help, we made the right choices about planning our intermission dinner and getting ready for the different aspects of the plot and the music. The book does not cover all of Wagner's work, but the omissions are well-chosen	2001-01-10

What distinguishes him from many of his colleagues is that he has always striven to capture the passion and the human side of a sport that is by nature highly technical. The Monaco Grand Prix is the last true road race that is left in the current Grand Prix calendar and its location, history and flair give it an air and mystique like no other race in the world. Schlegelmilch captures past and present, triumph and tragedy that make up the story of this most famous race in Formula One. The quality of the printed photos is outstanding and the book has a good balance of black and white and color images. The accompanying 3-language captions are short but informative. The book also includes full race statistics of all races up to 1998.	2001-01-03

She knows that I'm an avid cook who likes to try new things and has never been to Lousiana. This book is excellent for many reasons. First and foremost the recipes are great. They are well-selected and straight-forward to follow. Very often the secret to a special twist in the local or ethnic cuisine lies in the basics of being able to make the right kind of broth or sauce base. Emeril provides a wealth of information in this regard. He also shows once again that often the simple, traditional recipes are  the best. All of the recipes he provides come from Louisiana locals and he gives us the stories of how he found these recipes. These are very interesting and entertaining. One of my favorites is the seafood gumbo and he describes how he learned to make it from an old fisherman as they were riding on his boat. The book also gets high marks for pleasing the eye: the photography throughout is outstanding. The pictures have nothing to do at all with the recipes most of the time, though, so if  you do need visuals as a guide, this is not the book for you. However: his cooking instructions are so clear that in my opinion instructive pictures are superfluous anyway. Get it, read it, cook, and enjoy!	2000-12-20

Problem is: Gary Larson doesn't make any new cartoons anymore, so the off-the-wall calendar each year warms up another best-of selection from the vast trunks of his work. Nothing wrong with that. They are all great. This year's calendar in addition had hilarious historical comments from past milleniums. Now I have already sneak-previewed the 2001 selection of jokes and find many redundancies with this year. While there are a lot of favorites that I have been dying to see again, there are some that could have gone back to the trunk for a little while longer. Overall impression: good enough to satisfy Larson-junkies, but not outstanding. Gary, pick up the pencil and draw some more!	2000-12-18

I am from the flat land and never understood why people voluntarily venture above 26000 ft to catch lung oedemas and brain swelling at best. I had no pity for Beck Wheaters who was left for dead twice by his  mountaineering friends and who recently told his story in a book, on TV and every major newspaper of the country. To a certain degree I also don't understand some of Krakauer's own motivations. All of that said, I still believe that his account of the 1996 Everest desaster is an excellent book and a must-read. He delivers insights into the extreme-climbers psyche and answered a lot of questions about the sport (if one can call it that way) I have had for years. Krakauer is an OK, but not outstanding writer, yet his tale is so harrowing and stunning at the same time that the book becomes a typical all-nighter. Some of the characters evoked extreme anger and disbelief in me, only few come across as sympathetic. Krakauer does not pretend to be unbiased about the whole tragic affair and he makes that clear several times in the book. In light of that the harsh criticism he received, especially from friends and family of some of the lost climbers, appear understandable but too strong. Considering what the author himself went through in the thin air, his detailed memory and overall balanced account of the events of 1996 are amazing.	2000-12-15

Most people liked the latter better, I disagree so far. &quot;Day of confession&quot; is an athmospherically dense and gripping thriller that will not let you put the book down until the last page is turned. Folsom is a gifted and well-informed  writer who has no trouble creating believable scenarios on three continents at the same time. He carefully develops his charcters and puts together a complex, yet not too confusing and improbably plot that remains fast-paced until the end.  Folsom's protagonist is a wealthy LA lawyer from the glitz world of movie moguls who flies to Italy in response to an emergency phone message by a brother he has not seen or heard from in years. Before he knows what hit him, he is engulfed in a major international crisis with the Vatican at the center.  This book is up there in quality with Higgins' and Ludlum's finest.

In a year-by-year fashion the reader is able to follow how the world's fastest sport has evolved. A fascinating read in general and a must for every true F1 fan. Every decade is covered by a different expert guest writer, all of them great past and current champions of the sport, and this adds personal color, but also bias. David Coulthard of the McLaren-Mercedes Team covers the 90ies and of course gives his very personal perspective on the most recent seasons. The downside of the guest-writer format is a general loss in homogeneity that can't be avoided with this system. While the pictures are carefully selected and in part very stunning and excellent, some true gems of the past are sorely missed. It is very, very clear that this is a british book, and some of the other great European and South American drivers are not covered in as much depth.	2000-12-06

There was less of the usual complexity, the unexpected twists and turns in the plot, the richness of the characters. Like her heroine, Kay Scarpetta, the reader had not recovered from Benton Wesley's death, and Black Notice offered no relief, not many explanations and no insight into Kay's dealing with the loss of her lover. In &quot;the last precinct&quot; we finally get all of the above and much more. It is a very gratifying book on every level. We find out many new sides to Kay's character and revisit her relationship with Wesley on the backgound of a harrowing tale that picks up where the last book left off. It seamlessly leads us into a complex darkness we suspected but did not find in &quot;Black Notice&quot; where solutions seemed too obvious to be really true. As the story races on and we are drawn in deeper and deeper we realize that &quot;Black Notice&quot; was really the beginning of another great multi-novel story as Cornwell has crafted before when she created the evil Temple Gault character, Kay's nightmare that ended in a NY subway. Cornwell also skillfully builds new charcters on the good side of events: there is the prosecutor from New York and the psychiatrist friend who we will undoubtedly meet again. At the end of this extremely involving and suspenseful story we are once more, as in her best books so far, left craving for more and wondering where Kay will go next and what darkness lies around the corner.	2000-11-30

Her characters are too predicatble and the average mystery enthusiast has the whole thing figured out about half-way through. My biggest disappointment is the overall shoddy work she does on the story line. There is so little intriguing detail and almost no flesh to the main lines of the plot. This book is not even in the same league as some of her great earlier ones like &quot;loves music, loves to dance&quot; or &quot;let me call you sweetheart&quot;. While it is OK that she always seems to depict the stereotypical all-American Barbie or Cinderalla from-rags-to-riches heroine, she puts less and less effort in making the charcters believable.	2000-11-14

The way it starts off,  it reminds you of &quot;it's a wonderful life&quot;, because there is these  2 guys in Heaven discussing how they manipulate our fate here on earth. As  we leave heaven and enter the story, the characters of Max and Onno  immediately involve you. They could not be more different and better  matched at the same time and we breathlessly follow them through the  beginnings of their friendship and their incredible discussions about life,  music, history, philosophy, the universe. This is one of the greatest  qualities of this book: in the discussions of Onno and Max, as well as in  other casual settings in the book, Mulisch  displays an impressive  knowledge of history, philosophy, art, and music without ever sacrificing  tension in his storyline. The reader just gobbles up this information  without ever having the feeling of having been lectured. The story takes  some very incredible turns that will make your jaw drop and read even  faster, and when it is all over, you will be sorry you finished it so fast  and immediately vow to read it again because you ran too fast through all  those passages of sheer beauty in thought and writing.	2000-08-09
