What it does call itself is \\"The Most Comprehensive Source for Non-Subsidy E-Publishing,\\" and that's not difficult to believe, as the book is crammed with information, exhaustively researched, and well-referenced.  Ms. Wiesner has listed a staggering 170 royalty-paying ebook publishers, nearly half of whom  contributed interviews for a more in-depth profile.  There's also an easy-comparison chart of e-publishers, allowing prospective authors to tell at a glance if the publisher they're considering offers the features they're looking for.  If this were all The Definitive Guide had to offer, it would still be performing a pretty nearly priceless service to the thousands of people out there who are hopeful of having their books published in electronic form, but that's barely the beginning.  Ms. Wiesner also takes on the often touchy subject of subsidy publishing, offering a great deal of practical advice to new authors who might be swayed by the omnipresent advertising of the vanity press.  She discusses the advantages and disadvantages of publishing a book in electrons instead of, or in addition to, print, and what to look for in a publisher.  The Definitive Guide also tackles a wide range of promotional ideas for authors, including print authors, and the electronic download version (a steal at half the price of the p-book) links to hundreds of resources for authors to publish and promote both their -ebooks and their websites.  It would be difficult to imagine a more complete reference volume for the author in search of an e-publisher than this one.  If you can't live without the comforting weight of a hefty trade paperback in your hands, the US$24.95 price tag on the print version is still a bargain, but our recommendation is the fully-linked PDF download for a mere US$12.\\"<BR>--The Scorpion's Tale	2003-03-18

Various myths about electronic publishing are explained in addition to the benefits of the e-publishing industry versus traditional print publishing.  An outstanding chapter on the various e-publishers and interviews conducted with them literally saves a new author days of searching the Internet for epublishers to submit manuscripts to.  Her impressive table outlining the various e-publisher services is an excellent example of the time and effort that went into creating this publication.  A potpourri of additional resources for e-book promotion includes examples of a press release and press kit for a newly published e-book.  E-published authors share some creative ideas for ebook promotion varying from ingenious tips on how to utilize the Free Gallery of Author's Voices, where to apply for awards, teaching on-line workshops, free book excerpts, and even emery boards imprinted with the ebook's title and ISBN were used to promote their e-books.

If you're serious about Internet publishing, check this book.  This is the 2002 Edition.  Last year I said that this was an excellent book, and the same is true for the updated edition.  She writes intelligibly and to the point, and her points make sense.  So if you want to understand what electronic publishing is all about, start here.  It has an excellent opening discussion, and a long list of publishers nicely organized so that you can quickly verify royalty rates and other key aspects.  There are interviews with a number of their CEOs that are business rather than puff pieces; how many submissions do they get a month, how many do they accept-that sort of thing, of keen interest to writers. There's a list of e-publishing organizations, and it might be smart to join one of these before you have trouble with a publisher.  And there's a huge section on promotion ideas, because Internet publication requires activity by the author if a book is to sell well.  This book is a must-read for any writer who is serious about trying the Internet publishing market, for the general discussion as much as the listings.  You want to be informed, and this is the best information.\\"<BR>--Piers Anthony	2003-03-18

Wiesner, known for her romance e-series (\\"Gypsy Road\\", \\"Dare to Love\\") surveys the history and current state of e-publishing in straight-forward prose and takes a sympathetic look at the challenges e-books pose for librarians, particularily cost and circulation issues.  The survey of e-book technologies will also be of interest to librarians. Wiesner writes at length about the various publishing outlets available to e-authors, including an extensive list of contests that allow e-book entries.  She also provides web links and brief descriptions of e-publishers, often incorporating short interviews with editors. This clearly written and user-friendly reference is loaded with links to online resources as well as enriched by firsthand accounts and tips that budding e-authors will appreciate.

Wiesner provides in-depth exploration of the industry as well as interviews and hot links so readers can embark on further study.  In her revised version of the book, Wiesner outlines the four major divisions of publishers, as well as a frank discussion of subsidy vs. non-subsidy publishers.  For those new to the whole world of publishing, and for those who are somewhat familiar, but who need more specifics about the divisions, Wiesner lists what authors can expect for free or a fee from each of these options and provides an assessment of how the author may or may not benefit from each.  In the first chapter, Wiesner tackles the current state of the publishing industry with sobering frankness.  For those of us who have been writing for a while, we have heard the titterings of the shrinking mid-list for authors and the absence of publicity pushing for authors who are less than big-name literary cash cows. In stark terms that pull no punches, she successfully argues why the time for e-publishing has come.  Next, Wiesner introduces readers to the beginnings of e-publishing and then launches into a convincing list of advantages vs. disadvantages of e-publishing.  Her points are intelligently made and she demonstrates how e-publishing has been birthed from an atmosphere of writer and reader distrust and blossomed into one where nearly every legitimate writer's conference offers  workshops on e-publishing because the medium is building up an incredible amount of  momentum.  Wiesner lists the top five author complaints with most traditional publishers and counters with how e-publishers score high marks in these same areas with authors.  For those who aren't quite up on the current hardware used to read e-books, Wiesner introduces you to the latest technology and also discusses the future of e-book reading devices with an exploration of products in development.  Finally, my favorite chapter deals with the myths of electronic publishing and what the facts really are in relation to this medium.  Point by point, Wiesner simply blows away all the trite complaints of those who eschew e-publishing.  In the end, the firm conclusion is that e-publishing offers choices for readers and writers alike, and what's more, that e-publishing is destined to remain a viable and, ultimately, successful outlet for quality books.  If you're considering electronic publishing as an option for your book manuscript or poetry chapbook, you need to purchase Karen Wiesner's book. It's not only a wise investment of money and time, it's an investment in well-culled knowledge that will guide you effortlessly and intelligently through the maze of e-publishing toward a successful and satisfactory author experience.\\" <BR>--Bev Walton~Porter for Inscriptions Magazine	2003-03-18

And arm the reader she does in this updated and revised reference<BR>volume, which focuses on nonsubsidy electronic publishing.  Much of the book is devoted to a detailed directory of e-publishers. Each listing not only provides such facts as royalty  percentages, contract terms, formats and services provided, but also furnishes background information on the publisher's development.  A romance writer whose novels have been nominated for several e-book awards, Wiesner draws upon her own expertise and research, as well as the insights of other authors who have experience in this  medium. Those hungry for even more information on any of the thought-provoking topics covered can look to the main Web site references Wiesner provides.  The author's confidence in the merits of electronic publishing is evident in the text and she backs her opinions with data from a variety of resources.  A self-proclaimed former skeptic of e-publishing, Wiesner now sees this medium as a writer's dream come true because of the limitless possibilities it provides.  Even authors whose only interest in e-publishing is its effect on the fate of paperbound books and their historic home-the library-may at least find Wiesner's chapter on that topic interesting reading.  She also gives a timeline history of books, from 2000 B.C. to the present, that provides perspective on the origins and future of the book.  \\"Traditional books and their publishers will always be with us, but the bottom line is that electronic books and the publishers are also making a place for themselves,\\" Wiesner tells us.  \\"Within the next few years, it's more than likely that e-books will dramatically change the publishing industry as we know it.\\"  Wiesner isn't the only one who thinks so.  The author refers to the Association of American Publishers, which predicts that by 2005, 28 million people will useelectronic devices to do their reading.  \\"So, grab your hat and hold on while you consider the realities,\\" she says, \\"...and then thrill to the possibilities!\\"<BR>--The Writer Magazine	2003-03-18

Harry Potter I could ignore. But page after page after page about e-publishing was getting to be a bit much. Why they'd even covered it in the Wall Street Journal, too.   Lucky me.  Just as I was getting interested in e-pubs and what they had to offer along came a book making everything I'd read about them accessible and understandable.  Along came a book that could explain all the advantages and disadvantages in choosing electronic publishing over other methods of reaching publication. Along came ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING The Definitive Guide by Karen S. Wiesner.  \\"Now Ms. Wiesner is a bestselling romance writer and on-line columnist whose e-books have garnered numerous award nominations.  With her varied experiences and prolific output, there could be no better spokeswoman for the electronic book industry.  The fact that she knows how to write and how to explain this new technology so clearly and cleverly that a Luddite like me couldn't miss out is nothing short of phenomenal.  ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING has three major sections.  In the first section Wiesner defines terms so that neophytes can understand what will be covered and why.  The beginning author learns that the main thrust of this book will be on non-subsidy, royalty paying e-publishers.  That means the e-book publishers who pay the author, not the ones where the author pays the publisher.  Wiesner explains why publishing is such a mess and tells what we can all do about it.  She's honest when she outlines the disadvantages encountered here.  She says e-published authors will have to have a special grasp of e-technology so they can explain it to others.  She urges these authors become missionaries in their zeal to promote the new publishers and to support each other in their efforts. <BR>The second section of this book lists e-publishers and their interview responses.  Here's where readers and authors find out about the publishers' philosophies, goals, strategies and experiences. Wiesner advises her readers go over this section carefully, extracting useful information and enjoyment from the answers provided there.  The third section covers the future of e-publishing. Following that is a bonus section on promotion which includes over 300 hot links where authors can publicize their work. There are also several appendices included in the work.  ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING is a viable, comprehensive guide no writer should be without. The ease of linking with so many useful sites, right from the electronic text, is invaluable.

So what does this book have to offer that sets it apart from the rest? There are 3 main characteristics that make the book compelling.  First, the author isn't some Smart Alec who has just found a useful bandwagon to jump on...  The second plus point is the writing style.  There are books which are so objective in tone that they make a good substitute for insomnia tablets, and those which have such forced jocularity that you feel like hurling them through the window.  Wiesner manages to steer a middle course, coming across as an ordinary person who happens to know what she's talking about.  The third attribute of the book is its thoroughness... This book contains sound advice, interesting facts and represents great value for the money.\\"<BR>--Web Resources	2003-03-18

It's misunderstood...[but] publishers and authors alike are betting their pocketbooks that it'll be the wave of the future,&quot; says Wiesner in Electronic Publishing, one of the first books ever to attempt explaining this chaotic new publishing medium.<br />Wiesner is one of the authors betting e-publishing is the future. She's multi-published by several electronic publishers, including Hard Shell Word Factory, DiskUs Publishing, and Avid Press. One of her novels was nominated for Romantic Times' E-Book of the Year and two other titles were nominated for the Frankfurt e-Book Awards. Wiesner uses her considerable experience and meticulous research to explain every aspect--good and bad--of electronic publishing.<br />The author leaves no e-stone unturned. In discussing what authors can expect from e-publishing, she doesn't put on her rose-colored eye gear: &quot;the audience for this medium is still relatively small, public awareness is limited, and...[there's] less money and fewer sales...&quot;<br />She also, however, outlines the verdant possibilities of e-publishing and concurs that &quot;every one of [the medium's] disadvantages are temporary.&quot;<br />Electronic Publishing covers current and developing e-book technology, lists almost all known non-subsidy royalty-paying e-publishers, discusses e-author support avenues such as writers' organizations and discussion groups, and devotes one chapter to e-book promotion.<br />For those who are unfamiliar with e-publishing, Electronic Publishing is a valuable source. While the majority of the guide's information might not surprise the experienced e-authors, the resource listings and the promotion ideas will be of value to everyone. (November) --Michele R.

These definitions are not merely one-sentence overviews, they are page-long analyses of each publishing procedure.<br />She then goes on to explain the benefits of E-publishing and the reasons why the print world has forced this new alternative to emerge. We learn the history and origins of E-publishing, the advantages and disadvantages of this new industry and compelling reasons why we should embrace E-Publishing as the wave of the future.<br />Electronic Publishing is more complex than most of us realise, but thanks to this book we too can become knowledgeable about the available formats, security protocols (for copyright protection), distribution choices, hardware and technological advances in the industry.<br />This book dispels many of the myths and misconceptions that the average Joe has in regard to e-books. Even many authors have been fooled by bad-press and urban legend in regard to this valuable publishing tool.<br />Now that we know we want to be a part of this industry, Karen supplies us with a massive list of E-Publishers. She also details their mission, staff, distribution formats, royalties, submission guidelines, turnaround times, web addresses and interviews with the publishers themselves.<br />Probably the most useful section of the book to any e-author is the massive promotional section at the end.

US	51410940	RABUNX9MW4PPU	1929613954	962389356	Electronic Publishing : The Definitive Guide	Books	5	0	0	N	N	the only guide you should look to concerning...epublishing	Reviewed by: Bev Walton~Porter for Inscriptions Magazine Rating: ****<br />Hailed as a &quot;...must-own resource&quot; by Publisher's Weekly, Karen Wiesner's guide to electronic  publishing is not only definitive, it's the only guide you should look to concerning the e-publishing industry.  Wiesner provides in-depth exploration of the industry as well as interviews and hot links so readers can  embark on further study.<br />In her revised version of the book, Wiesner outlines the four major divisions of publishers, as well as a frank discussion of subsidy vs. non-subsidy publishers. For those new to the whole world of publishing, and for those who are somewhat familiar, but who need more specifics about the divisions, Wiesner lists what authors can expect for free or a fee from each of these options and provides an assessment of how the author may or may not benefit from each.<br />In the first chapter, Wiesner tackles the current state of the publishing industry with sobering frankness. For those of us who have been writing for a while, we have heard the titterings of the shrinking mid-list for authors and the absence of publicity pushing for authors who are less than big-name literary cash cows. In stark terms that pull no punches, she successfully argues why the time for e-publishing has come.<br />Next, Wiesner introduces readers to the beginnings of  e-publishing and then launches into a convincing list of advantages vs. disadvantages of e-publishing. Her points  are intelligently made and she demonstrates how e-publishing has been birthed from an atmosphere of writer and reader distrust and blossomed into one where nearly every  legitimate writer's conference offers workshops on e-publishing because the medium is building up an incredible amount of momentum. <br />Wiesner lists the top five author complaints with most traditional publishers and counters with how e-publishers score high marks in these same areas with authors.   <br />For those who aren't quiteup on the current hardware used to read e-books, Wiesner introduces you to the  latest technology and also discusses the future of  e-book reading devices with an exploration of products in development.<br />Finally, my favorite chapter deals with the myths of electronic publishing and what the facts really are in relation to this medium. Point by point, Wiesner simply blows away all the trite complaints of those who eschew e-publishing. In the end, the firm conclusion is that e-publishing<br />offers choices for readers and writers alike, and what's more, that e-publishing is destined to remain a viable and, ultimately, successful outlet for quality books.<br />If you're considering electronic publishing as an option for your book manuscript or poetry chapbook, you need to purchase Karen Wiesner's book. It's not only a wise investment of money and time, it's an investment in well-culled knowledge that will guide you effortlessly<br />and intelligently through the maze of e-publishing toward a successful and satisfactory author experience.	2001-04-17

Boy, could I empathize with Bethany being completely blown away by sexy, tenacious Rod. He's leather, she's lace, and what a fine combination they make.  Karen Wiesner has a way with characterization. All her characters are different, with complex backgrounds, individual voices, and oh so compelling.  Each of these &quot;Gypsies&quot; needs his/her own book. I'm glad Karen loved them enough to write their individual stories, and I'm extremely glad that her publisher had the foresight to grab them and run. Read   Leather &amp; Lace, you'll enjoy it.

Electronic Publishing: The Definitive Guide is a wealth of information for authors who are hesitant to venture into electronic publishing.  Wiesner begins with a definition of electronic publishing and then focuses on the advantages and disadvantages of epublishers, pointing out the differences between subsidy and royalty-paying epublishers.  Various myths about electronic publishing are explained in addition to the benefits of the epublishing industry versus traditional print publishing. An outstanding chapter on the various epublishers and interviews conducted with them saves a new author days of searching the Internet for epublishers to submit manuscripts to.  <br />A potpourri of additional resources for ebook promotion includes examples of a press release and press kit for a newly published ebook.  Contributions from epublished authors varied from ingenious tips on how to create a promotional bookmark, excerpt pamphlets, or magnets to creatively designed recipe cards and even wrapped chocolates were used to promote their ebooks.<br />Overall, Electronic Publishing: The Definite Guide lives up to my expectations and I highly recommend it to all ebook authors, whether they have been epublished yet or not.

Before the days of e-publishing, hungry and hopeful writers would scramble to the library for the reference copy of a book called ==Writer's Market==, which is a a comprehensive listing of literary agents and publishers. Karen Wiesner's guide is the equivalent of Writer's Market  for the world of e-books. The difference is that in print-book publishing you pray that somebody will take you; in e-book publishing you pick the publisher you want. Wiesner's book lists more than one hundred non-subsidy e-publishers. Each publisher has been given the chance to tell about his practices on Wiesner's detailed questionnaire. The publishers listed here are &quot;non-subsidy&quot; publishers, meaning that authors do not pay them to be published. The book contains well-written articles by Jamie Engle and Mary Z. Wolf, and other supplementary features including practical ideas for promoting your e-book after publication...  there is a mountain of useful information here, especially for<br />new writers, and Ms. Wiesner's  enthusiasm for electronic books is healthfully contagious.&quot; Michael Pastore for Booklovers Review	2001-04-17

(Yes, I know it's an e-book, but  it's on my Rocket eBook reader so I CAN pick it up. (Bet you were trying to picture me juggling my tower, keyboard and monitor...) I was right when I said that if Jon was that intense of a character, Blackie would be something else.  He was phenomenal.  Talk about deep issues!  And Lori-she wasn't the pure, innocent heroine we normally get (she was a wild teenager); she was actually easier to identify with and feel for.  Karen Wiesner writes deep, gritty characters-- real people--not the usual &quot;perfect&quot; people, and she does it well.

Author of the highly praised GYPSY ROAD SERIES, ELECTRONIC  PUBLISHING is admittedly a broad deviation from Wiesner's usual romantic  works. However, it's one that I am very happy she took the time for.  <br />&quot;Her book addresses every conceivable question that anyone  considering electronic publishing could think of - and then some. Both the  known advantages as well as the disadvantages are zeroed in on. This is an  honest peek at epublishing - still a virgin venture for us all. Chapter  Five sensibly looks at the technology needed to take epublishing into the  future. There is a terrific chapter addressing the &quot;13 Myths&quot; of  epublishing which gives a real boost to the 'credibility' of the business.  Wiesner has wisely included interviews with publishers which are extremely  helpful if you are thinking of venturing into the field. It gives you the  opportunity to hear from the publishers themselves what they expect in the  way of submissions, their royalty structure and what they foresee as the  future in this infant business. The last chapter focuses on quotes from  successfully epublished authors. All of whom have tested the electronic  waters first. <br />&quot;ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING: The Definitive Guide is a  wealth of information. One that Karen Wiesner plans to update on a regular  basis.

That's a lot of questions! Now, for the first time, there's a comprehensive  guide that has all the answers. Karen Wiesner's Electronic Publishing: The  Definitive Guide has all those answers and more. Not only does she explain  how electronic publishing works, she tells the advantages, disadvantages,  what types of books really fly (you know, those books editors tell you are  so great but have no place in their house?). She has a long list of  electronic publishers (more than I knew existed), most of which include a  comprehensive interview with the publisher answering just about every  question you could possibly have, and hotlinks to get you there when you're  ready. While it won't eliminate the need for you to investigate your  prospective publisher (you are supposed to do that :) ), it WILL give you  one heck of a head start. There are interviews with authors who've gone the  electronic route and explain how the experience has been. And, as if that  weren't enough, Karen includes a bonus chapter on promoting your books once  you sell.  If you're electronically published, interested in electronic  publishing, or even just curious about what it's all about, Electronic  Publishing, The Definitive Guide is for you.&quot; <br />            -- Lisa  Ramaglia for Scribes World Reviews	1999-12-31
