Eternity, Massachusetts 1855 <br /> <br />For generations, couples have been coming to Eternity, Massachusetts, to exchange wedding vows.  Legend has it that those married in Eternity's chapel are destined for a lifetime of happiness.  This is the story of how it all began and the townsfolk are more than willing to help keep the legend alive. <br /> <br />Many of the people of Eternity were outspoken in their abhorrence of the Fugitive Slave Law, which permitted slaves who had reached free states to be captured and returned to their masters.  Some had joined Reverend Bowman, who was a conductor of the Underground Railroad, a network of abolitionist and free blacks who conspired to lead slaves to Canada.   <br /> <br />Abolitionist William Powell, second to Reverend Bowman, was a man secretly committed to a just and dangerous cause and there was no room in his life for the kind of distraction that beautiful Welsh immigrant Bronwyn Davies was fast becoming.  Nor for the passions she was beginning to stir in his long-barren heart.  Bronwyn first arrived in Massachusetts with her little brother and two little sisters to work at Miss Pembrook's School for Young Ladies.  William's younger sister Constance attended that school. When Miss Pembrook and Constance met Bronwyn and her siblings at the pier, Miss Pembrook did not like what she saw and refused to hire Bronwyn.  Constance then persuaded William to hire her as their family cook in hopes it would entice their ill Welsh father to eat to gain back his health.  <br /> <br />This quick, enjoyable tale is well told with lots of feeling and is fairly easy to follow.  <br /> <br />VOWS is the seventh book in the Harlequin's Weddings, Inc. series.

England, April 1823 <br /> <br />Nicholas Brennan has everything a dashingly good-looking wealthy American Yankee can possess.  He's tall, dark and handsome and speaks with a silver tongue.  At first glance it's apparent he's a rogue and undying cad!  He is also a man driven by revenge.   <br /> <br />\\"Marriage is for fools!\\"  That is what Trista Fitzgerald firmly stated before she was forced by her father to suffer her first London Season into proper society with her maternal Aunt Esme as her chaperone.  Trista is a headstrong and willful beauty with eyes as green as the first Spring grasses and flowing hair like liquid fire and gold.  All Trista wants is to get through the next three months and return to her tranquil country life.   <br /> <br />Nicholas made the journey to London from Richmond, Virginia in pursuit of the solicitor, Oswald Sleeth.  Unfortunately, Oswald met an untimely death two weeks past, but perhaps Oswald's brother, Archibald could make do in his place.  Nicholas needs to uncover the reason for the tragic fate of his family business, Trent Shipping, and to find the person responsible for its ruin.  That person will rue the day of his birth! <br /> <br />Trista's first taste of London was being accosted by a distasteful fat and slimy man with less than respectable intentions.  Fortunately for Trista, Nicholas witnessed the situation and intercepted by stating Trista was his blushing bride.  Fortunately for Nicholas, this man was Archibald Sleeth.  But who's going to rescue Trista from Nicholas?  Nicholas is not a man that accepts the word, \\"no\\" despite the outcome.  Trista is a woman whose desires will not stay hidden despite her best efforts to declare otherwise.    <br /> <br />Besides the endless monotony of going through the motions in regards to the Season, London is embroiled with the mystery of the \\"Boudoir Murderer.\\"  Young beautiful women were being savagely molested and beaten before being killed and the assailant's identity is not known.  Is someone purposely stalking young socialites and could Trista be the next victim?  Can she trust anyone other than Aunt Esme? <br /> <br />In a night of stolen passion between Tristan and Nicholas, they are discovered in a steamy compromising position.  A disgraced Trista is now given no choice but to marry the scoundrel.  Playing the character of an unforgivable cad and smooth rogue was part of Nicholas's strategy of revenge and he was even beginning to enjoy the role, but Trista was not part of his plan.

She doesn't want to think about the hungry winter everyone at Harwood and Wakeland would suffer if they failed to keep the wolf from their door.  Armand is her last and only hope to keep the wolf at bay.  That wolf is Eudo St. Maur, former Earl of Anglia; Wolf of the Fens.   <br /> <br />About five years ago, Dominie learned her beloved Armand, her father Baldwin and brother Denys were killed in battle at Lincoln. It was only recently she learned Armand may not have died, but actually joined an Abbey about 30 miles away and was now known as Brother Peter.  One of the reasons for Armand's abandonment was because Baldwin had broken an oath after he pledged allegiance to old king Stephen thus ending Armand's birthright entitlement to Harwood.  Wakeland and Harwood now solely belongs to the De Montfords.  Armand's guilt for killing Baldwin and Denys and his desertion of the fair Dominie lead him to the cosseted life of a humble monk.    <br /> <br />Upon persistent provocation from Dominie for Armand to leave the Abbey and lead the defense of Wakeland and Harwood in a standoff against the evil Eudo St. Maur, Armand promised only to train the occupants, not take up arms himself.  Armand could not easily dismiss his vow of non violence or his desire to lead a cloistered life.  What would Dominie do if she learned the real deep-seated reasons for Armand's guilt and the actions behind them?  How can Armand ever again dismiss his craving for the bewitching Domonie?  Is it truly possible for Armand to now completely reject the vows he made so long ago and once again live among the inhabitants of his youth and defend what should have rightfully been his?  Would the people of the villages ever fully forgive his abandonment?   <br /> <br/>Dominie has reservations of her own.  Can she allow herself to regain the lost love she had for Armand?  If all could be overcome, could lasting harmony be had between them?  Will everything be for naught if St. Maur is not repressed?  <br /> <br />This well told medieval novel is a typical tale of a battle for peace, land and love.

Two years widowed, Aunt Emma lived with her bachelor sons, Sam and Jay on their large ranch, The Hook.  Yes, Aunt Emma and her San Miguel ranch just might be the place for Anne to spread her wings and fly.  To really soar for the first time in her life.  That's what Anne thought until she got to the desolate and uncivilized dusty town and when an Indian met her at the train station and told her he was her cousin Sam, she thought she had made a mistake, a big mistake!  Anne didn't know her cousin Sam was adopted and half-Apache.  But what an intriguing and handsome man he was!  His heritage didn't prevent Anne's instant attraction and from thinking about the possibilities of exploring what it would be like to be physically loved by Sam!  Wow!  Only in her wildest dreams!  Jay, on the other hand turned out to be vastly different.  He is the biological son of Uncle John and Aunt Emma, conceived shortly after Sam came to live them.  The unspoken secret about Sam didn't prevent Aunt Emma from loving Sam as her own.  Jay, on the other hand grew up hating Sam because he always felt second-best and Jay never failed to try to provoke Sam into displaying his \\"savage tendencies.\\"  And when Jay sensed Anne's attraction to Sam, he didn't like it one bit and he became even more nasty and vocal.  Both he and Sam knew it was wise that Anne change her mind, but for different reasons and those reasons were not necessarily in Anne's best interest.  Despite Sam's intense fascination and desire for Anne, he knew it just wasn't proper for a respectable and refined white woman to love a half-breed.  Sam was born of two worlds; at home in neither and he was forever at war with himself.  Jay's interest in Anne and really everything else was purely selfish lust, meanness and greed.  Just how far will the despicable Jay go to get what he wants?  Is Anne's determination strong enough to withstand Jay's deviousness?   <br /> <br />Over time, Anne wondered if she could convince Sam she really does love him no matter what and that they can overcome any obstacles.  But is it really possible love can withstand the frequent demonstrations of severe and cruel prejudice and the  unceasing displays of hate and near-death physical violence?  Just how much can one be expected to endure?  Despite these problems, how would Sam deal with the truth about Anne if he ever found out?  Her biggest fear is if Sam would be able to live with that knowledge and still make a future with her despite it all?  Was Anne herself truly convinced all these barriers could be conquered?  Is all of it really worth it? <br /> <br />This is a great old Southwest tale and Mary McBride relays it with talent and feeling.

There is not much of it in this historical novel. <br /> <br />This is a good book, but definitely not as romantically inclined as the title, back cover description and sensual sketch suggests.  It is about the life saga of two girls from the teenage years through the twilight years of affluent beautiful Isabel and plain impoverished Marian.  They are forever linked together by the death of Marian's brother and their story is told through the eyes of Marian.  This lengthy and well detailed saga describes the trials, tribulations and little happiness of these women and the people closely associated with them. The storyline is good and easy to follow but I feel it's rather bleak and generally unhappy, if not outright depressing in some of the scenarios.  If I had realized this book is not as romantically inclined and mostly cheery as I prefer to read, I would not have chosen it.  Though it is not what I anticipated, it is a five star read.   <br />	2004-08-04

GUILTY PLEASURES delicious plot is reminiscent of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice with an ugly duckling/Cinderella-ish twist and is absolutely enchanting!  I was enthralled from page one to the last and would have liked the author to continue with the story.  The characters are strong-minded, determined, affable, and completely endearing.  If you are familiar with Pride and Prejudice (a must read classic-romance doesn't get any better than this!), Anthony somewhat reminds me of Mr. Darcy and Daphne somewhat reminds me of Elizabeth Bennet.  Almost from the beginning, sparks fly between the haughty Anthony and the intellectual Daphne. The dialog between the two is continually emotional with snappy, quick-witted dry humor.  Their physical interaction is constantly sensual and always with a dynamical zing.   Through many trials and tribulations of the heart and the eventual meeting of the minds, a tender love story emerges.   <br /> <br />A definite keeper to be enjoyed again!  Don't miss it!   <br />	2004-08-01

The story is everything fluffy, warm, fuzzy and unexciting. If you are a devoted fan of Donna Fletcher, you'll probably love this book. Those of us who have never read her works and was anticipating dramatic escapades, it was surprisingly bland and continually flat. I noted the storyline was heavy into messages against prejudice and preaching how one should look at life. I didn't find the messages overwhelming to the point of reader overload; the book just wasn't what I was expecting from reading the back cover. To give Remember the Magic its due, it did keep my interest. It was a pleasant tale and I enjoyed it, but I doubt I will look for more books by this author as I like my books with a more rousing storyline.<br /><br />  It appears Remember The Magic is a somewhat sequel to Wedding Spell. Just because Remember The Magic wasn't for me, it doesn't mean it wasn't a good book and should pass up.	2004-07-30

Regency Era          Seventeen-year-old spunky, free thinking tomboy Alexandra-Alexa Howard was born in England but grew up on her family?s coffee plantation in Ceylon. She was a beauty with storm dark eyes and long gold-tinted auburn hair. Growing up she was allowed free reign, and is now greatly struggling to settle down as a refined young lady. She much prefers to participate in hunting adventures and has a devout interest in the operations of running the plantation.           She lives with her parents, mother Victorine, father Martin, brother Freddy and paternal aunt, Harriet Howard. Aunt Harriet, or affectionately called ?Aunt Harry,? is actually the one who raised her and the one trying to turn her into a refined, marriageable debutant, much to Alexa?s dismay.          One of her family?s best friend, wealthy Sir John Travers, whom Alexa affectionately calls Uncle John, persuaded Governor James Alexander Stewart Mackenzie and Mrs. Mackenzie to sponsor a debutante ball for Alexa?s18th birthday at their Queen?s House in Colombo, capital city of the British Crown Colony of Ceylon. The ball was against Alexa?s wishes, but she conceded to make the best of it in hopes it would soon be over. Upon arriving the night before at Queen?s House, she begged the maid to take to her to the secluded, seldom used, natural ocean water pond, called the Governor?s Pool. Alexa decided swimming naked in the moon-lit warm evening would refresh her spirits enough to endure pretending enjoyment at tomorrow?s ball. While she was taking pleasure in her midnight swim, she alarmingly felt a pair of human hands grasp her around the waist. The hands unmistakably belonged to a man, a naked man, who immediately remarked, ?Well, Well! I seem to have caught myself a mermaid!? Shocked, Alexa was mysteriously spellbound by this sensual stranger and obvious rogue. She couldn?t believe she actually allowed him to steal a kiss and that she enjoyed it and wanted more! She immediately disengaged herself from this stranger and hurried back to her room. She decided to forget the incident ever happened and go on with preparations for tomorrow.           She was definitely the belle of the ball with every unattached man competing for her attention. She was appalled and distressed to discover the arrogantly scandalous stranger in attendance. His name is Nicholas de la Guerra, aka Nicholas Dameron. Alexa was astonished to still feel that same fierce passion, desire and intense dislike for him that she felt last night.          Soon liberated from the responsibility of her parents, she was free to enjoy the excitement of Naples, Rome, Paris and London. Though as much as she tried, Alexa could not forget the desire Nicholas sparked, and being the scoundrel that he is, he soon ruthlessly betrayed her. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn?t overcome reliving the gripping passion and agonizingly delicious ecstasy that only the hated Nicholas Dameron could satisfy. Her entire essence was possessed by this one man who had taken her virtue, scorned her pride and callously broke her heart. Angry and very bitter, she passionately pursued her plan of revenge. She was blind to everything other than her scheme of vengeance, though she was constantly pursued by the marriageable men of the upper crust.          Can she possibly attain a satisfactory conclusion to her torment, or is she to continue suffering this fate that?s worse than death?          The narratives in this novel are excessively long-sometimes to the point of overkill! The 1st 1982 edition consists of 612 pages. I believe if Ms. Rogers had decreased some of the descriptions, it would not have taken anything away from the significance of the scenarios. The plot is filled with love, steamy desire, many surprises, deplorable secrets, shocking scandal, appalling brutality and it?s all very dramatic. You?ll find Surrender to Love is a paperback you will love or one you feel that?s mediocre and a test of your patience.It vaguely reminds me of the book, The Other Side of Midnight (and it sequel, Memories of Midnight; excellent books-definitely recommend!) by Sidney Sheldon. Surrender to Love does take time to read and though I mostly enjoyed it, I will not be adding it to my collection as I doubt I?d read it again. The brutality was limited to one scene, but it was too graphic for me and I won't be seeking other writings of Ms. Rogers because of it.	2004-07-14

Silver's mother had turned her daughter's wedding into Masonville's society event of the year with virtually the entire town in attendance.  But after waiting for nearly two hours at the alter for Bob, a furious Silver stormed from the church.

It was all the money in the world they had.  <br />Shamed and devastated, Silver decided to take matters into her own hands so she went to the Denver mortgage company to plead for more time and was granted an extra ninety days before foreclosure would begin.  As the last search effort trying to locate Bob, Silver was put into contact with a bounty hunter and the bounty hunter turned out to be the mysterious stranger she glimpsed on her devastating wedding day.  Being somewhat sympathetic and in extreme desperation for money, Jared agreed to accept the job, despite the fact that Silver insists on helping him even if the pursuit took them cross country.  <br />Jared has a hauntingly devastating past of his own; the brutal murder of his entire family six years earlier.  The search for the killer of his Kentucky loved ones brought him to Colorado and he vowed to continue the pursuit of the killer for as long as it takes to bring him to justice.  Can he perform the much needed job Silver has hired him to do as well as continue his own search?

Attractive, good-natured, hard-working and extremely naive Ellie dreams of a future with a lovingly devoted husband with a home of their own.  When smooth-talking Tommy Jamison started courting Ellie, she was quickly filled with his golden promise of her lifelong dream.  Tommy's controlling and domineering parents hastily moved him back East to attend college and away from a possible problem their son may have caused with the unrefined and common Miss Mitchum.<br />Remembering that her mother died some years before due to a growth in her belly, Ellie was frantic with fear when her belly mysteriously started getting big, so she made an appointment with Whitehorn's only doctor, the handsome bachelor, Winton Gray.  He assured Ellie she was not dying from a growth, but only having a baby-a perfectly natural occurrence.  Understanding Ellie's predicament as a girl of &quot;a certain reputation,&quot; Doc decided Ellie was the answer to his prayers as his life unquestionably needed the special touch of an organized down-to-earth woman and Ellie definitely needed a father for her baby.

She grew up never learning how to love and this left her with a bitter determination to achieve respectability along with vast wealth. The only friends she has are a kindhearted soiled dove named Cara Jardeen and a young union rabble-rousing miner by the name of Simon Tremeaine.   <br />Zoë knew from a young age that she will do almost anything to achieve her goal, even if it means a loveless marriage.

When she saw an advertisement for a \\"wilderness expert\\" for an escort to Pony, Montana, she immediately applied.  She soon discovered the escorted will be the wealthy eleven-year-old brat, Roger Bannister III.  Having no wilderness experience or sense of direction what so ever, the two became lost in the wild beauty of Idaho where she severely sprained her ankle.  Thankfully, ruggedly handsome half-breed Crow Indian, Jacob Blackhawk Chandler, rescues Amanda. Witty barbs as well as sexual sparks immediately started to fly between them!  All of a sudden Roger deathly screams and he mysteriously disappears deep within the woods.  Jacob agrees to help Amanda locate him and escort them to Montana for a ridiculously excessive fee.  <br />While Amanda and Jacob are searching for Roger and his kidnappers, Amanda slowly acknowledges her growing desire for Jacob.  Jacob, carrying severe emotional and physical scars as well as suffering from life-long racial prejudice, is having a hard time denying his smoldering attraction for her.  He feels no respectable white women would ever consider loving a \\"breed\\" and Jacob will not subject the beautiful Amanda to a tortured life that would bring, despite Amanda's words of complete love and devotion.  Through many trials and tribulations they finally succumb to their sensual cravings...and upon the kidnappers.  <br />After the life-and-death rescue skirmish, Roger is returned to his father and Amanda pays Jacob his well-earned fee and they go their separate ways.  Amanda sadly realizes Jacob is permanently out of her life and that she must somehow make it to Seattle and try to begin anew.  Jacob now knows he cannot live without his precious Amanda and sets out to find her and profess his undying love despite having devastatingly rejected her.   He realizes he must face his fear that she may now feel that loving a \\"breed\\" might not be worth the lifelong pain of discrimination regardless of their untamed passion.  <br />What a book!  It was the best $.99 I spent in a long time!  It's full of explicit sensual desire and heart pumping adventure that will definitely provoke your emotions.  <br />I highly recommend this book!	2004-05-12

Her pap, Pat Cox, is a hard drinking, lazy, out-of-work, ex-Confederate horse soldier, cow wrangler, and scout.  <br />During one of his drinking stupors, her pap is accused of helping rob a bank and lands in prison waiting to hang the next day.  Just in time Hope successfully breaks her pap out of prison through a phony governor's pardon and by a crowbar to the warden's crotch.  They immediately sign up for a cattle drive that will travel through Wyoming with the famous \\"Uncle\\" John Chisum.  Hope quickly falls in lust for the good-looking trail boss, Jeb Mason.  Jeb also has future political ambitions.  During the trail drive, they encounter a rich Wyoming rancher and his dashingly handsome Irish foreman, Timothy O'Callahan.  The Wyoming rancher pays beyond top dollar to immediately purchase the \\"cow critters\\" and deliver them to his ranch.  Hope and Timothy are immediately attracted to each other and Hope must decide which man will win her heart.  Timothy advises Hope to stake out a Wyoming ranch site once they arrive in the Powder River area while Jeb returns to Texas continuing to work for \\"Uncle\\" John. <br />Courageous Hope successfully starts her ranch and passionately lobbies for women's rights and their entitlement to vote.  Through extreme trials and tribulations, Hope and Jeb marry.  Hope becomes a Justice of the Peace and Jeb becomes a U.S. Congressman with his eye on the Wyoming governorship.  Jeb is killed by an explosion and U.S. Marshall Timothy O'Callahan re-enters Hope's life as she is elected Wyoming's first woman governor.  <br />I stuck with the book but struggled through it with a wandering mind.  For a historical western it is superbly realistically told with meticulously explained details; so much so that the crux of the situation could have been explained in just a couple of pages, not as long and drawn out as it was.<br />The heroine is portrayed as a tomboy know-it-all, can-do-it-all educated woman, but she speaks in absurdly ridiculous dialogue.  The male counterparts are not described as magnificently as one hope in a romance novel and it didn't incite a dynamic zing.  I think this reads more like a Zane Grey story rather than a romance novel.	2004-05-08

Jamaica, Boston, Virginia 1795<br />Young and beautiful Catherine Mary O'Neill a.k.a. Jasmine, lived the carefree fantasy life in the magnificent wilds of Jamaica with her doctor grandfather.  When Jasmine was just a child, her grandfather rescued a beautiful little slave girl, Marly, from a fate worse than death and he raise the two girls as if they were blood sisters.<br />Captain Johnathon Mahn was self-made; a wealthy shipping magnate as well as a notorious lady's man with a reported mistress in every port.

He and Jasmine met while riding horses along a road and ended in an evening of stolen virtue and discovered passion.  While trying to escape desperate circumstances, Jasmine unknowingly stowed away on one of Captain Mahn's ships heading to the new world.  Upon discovery on board, Captain Mahn took Jasmine and her troubles under his wing as he couldn't get the gorgeous Jasmine off his mind and hopefully back into his bed.  <br />Jasmine fell in love with the handsome captain, but she was adamant not to become one of his mistresses, despite Captain Mahn's instance he'll never wed.  It was with reluctance Jasmine accepted Captain Mahn's assistance in starting a new life in the Colonies.  She eventually captured the good captain's heart and he finally put a ring on her finger.  All was going well for them until an act of revenge by one of the undiscovered traitors almost ended their fairytale.  <br />This spellbinding book is well worth reading, if you enjoy passionate characters with high drama!	2004-05-03

Era:  1850<br />Libby's Bostonian life if filled with afternoon teas, high society and everything her heart desired served on a silver platter.  Libby's spouse of less than 10 years, Englander Hugh Grenville is an aspiring, but unsuccessful poet whose fanciful dream of riches leads him to pursue the promise of wealth in the California Gold Rush.  Hugh also leaves behind their two daughters, seven-year-old Eden and four-year-old Bliss.  Deciding there is no way Hugh could survive frontier life and the riggers of hard manual work in the rugged California hills, Libby and their daughters leave home in pursuit of Hugh.  In New Orleans Libby meets handsome and dashing riverboat gambler, Gabe Foster.  Gabe has the uncanny ability to be there whenever Libby and her daughters need assistance, whether it's during the long wagon train across country or the challenging, grueling, demanding and strenuous life in the mining town of Hangtown, California.  Libby's headstrong ingenuity enables her and her daughters to survive while searching for Hugh.  In the meantime, Gabe comes in and out of her life and she finally succumbs to her desire that results in an unplanned pregnancy.  A very ill Hugh is finally located and Libby nurses him back to health and is determined to forget Gabe and build her life with Hugh.<br />During Libby's trials and tribulations, her daughters become ill due to a poor diet, so she enlists the advice of her trusted friends and confidants Ah Fong and Mark Hopkins, to successfully start her own business of raising vegetables which brings her daughter back to good health.  Her vegetable growing venture leads into a successful business.  Eventually she encounters Gabe again and he's gravely ill with smallpox.  With her love and devotion, Gabe is nursed back to health and permanently into Libby's life-this time for good.<br />The book is very good.  If you enjoy a good story of a woman's riches to rags to riches story, you'll enjoy this.  If you want the stories filled with romance, this book will disappoint you as I find it's more of a book of adventure versus romance.	2004-04-22

They and their mother decide to find their father, Clay who they believed to be a lost but alive government hero, but is actually rumored to be an outlaw.  Along their wagon odyssey, their mother dies and the children continue on until they reach the little town of Misery.  In Misery they meet up with old, lonely and poor Aaron Smiler.   Aaron raises the children as his own.<br />Once the boys are grown and gone, Kitty grows to be an independent headstrong and buckskin clad woman who alone rounds up wild mustangs as their only source of income.  Upon one of her round-ups, she discovers a handsome and dying Bo Chandler.  Kitty nurses him back to health and he decides to repay her by staying at the Smiler ranch to help her and Aaron do some repairs, cook and clean.<br />Kitty doesn't recognize her growing like and dependency towards Bo as the beginnings of love.  Aaron, Kitty's brothers and the townspeople learn that Bo is a big city lawyer exploring the country and he is soon helping others with his legal expertise.  Kitty decides she doesn't care others' caution of Bo possibly swindling her of her love and of her meager possessions, so she gives herself freely to Bo one night inside the barn.  She decides she greatly likes the physical act of love and tells Aaron in no uncertain terms she will continue to do so, regardless if he approves or not. <br />Eventually love prevails and all turns out well.  <br />I found the book to be disjointed and mediocre at best.  It began to be unbelievable starting with the children traveling alone surprising easy after the death of their mother. Kitty is portrayed as a strong but naive woman in her twenties but she acts like she's a ten-years-old and quite a simpleton.  Bo is just too good to be true as he happily cooks and cleans after Kitty and Aaron as well as handles all the outside chores.  Aaron seems to be the only character that is somewhat realistic until he easily condones Kitty and Bo having premarital sex.  The book is not dynamic, but it's not the worse one I've ever read either. <br />Ms. Langan has also written in addition to Badlands Heart, Badlands Law and Badlands Legend.  I assume these two books are about Kitty's brothers, Gabe and Yale.	2004-04-19

It's missing due to Maggie's blunder. On route to Marlow, she and fellow coach passenger are in a stagecoach robbery which leaves her financially stranded.  Scientific minded Maggie tells fellow coach passenger the reason for her trip is to retrieve missing scientific research, even if she has to steal it.  Unbeknownst to her, the other coach passenger is the handsome sheriff, Spence Harding.<br />When they finally reach the dusty town of Marlow, Spence decides to keep his eye glued on Maggie and he begrudgingly helps her adjust to western life until she can make enough money for her return trip home.  Along the way, she doesn't realize she is growing to love this small town and that the townspeople are growing to love her.  Most suprisingly is that Maggie discovers she is in love with Spence, but if only Spence would recognize that he... <br />The town of Marlow, Colorado is first detailed in Judith Stacy's short story of Wild West Wager in the book of A Hero's Kiss with other short stories by authors, Diana Palmer and Mary Burton.  It's my recommendation you first read Wild West Wager in A Hero's Kiss and continue with Maggie and the Law.

I felt the main characters lacked the suspenseful sizzle one wants in a romance novel.  The author could have developed more deeply the difficulty of living in a new land with an unintended spouse and the long road of understanding and mishaps it took to recognize they were right for each other after all.  <br />This is a good, enjoyable easy read, but not a keeper.	2004-02-23

I read this first and I will not read the prequel, Hero of Flint Hills, as I will donate this book to our library in hopes others will enjoy it more than I did.	2004-02-15

Despite the odd mask aspect, it's a moving love story and is definitely worth your time to read it!	2004-02-13
