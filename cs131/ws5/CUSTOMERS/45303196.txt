Jabanoski certainly doesn't mince words in his feelings on the current administration, and where he thinks we Americans are headed as a result of the current administration's policies.  I agree with some of his assessments and disagree with others, but subtle he is NOT.  This is the liberal equivilant of right-wing talk radio, where opinions are jammed down your throat.  I doubt a lot of conservatives are going to read this book, so he's probably preaching to the choir.  My main problem with the book was not so much with its subject matter, but it seemed to me that this work could desperately use the services of an editor.  What's with all the italicized words?  It seemed there were about 20 on each page, and I frankly found it annoying.  Does a good writer need to express himself with that many italicized words, when he could just be a little more descriptive?  I also found several typos, and the book seemed to come off a cheap printing press, as the ink on several pages seemed smudged or the characters on one line in a paragraph would be twice as tall as the preceding line.  I think with a little editorial cleanup and a better press, this would be a much better work.  I think Jabanoski's got important things to say, he just needs to find an editor and a different publisher.	2005-09-01

I read some of the other reviews where people were comparing this work to Jay McInerney or other authors and blah blah blah...This novel stands on its own as a funny, smart book.  There are not a whole lot of lessons, and Tom Reasons, the protagonist, even says at the end, &quot;Don't ask me to add everything up.  It's too early in the morning, and I've never been any good at spotting the moral.&quot;  This book is about gambling, darts, 80s and 90s music, single life in NYC, and, what I think a lot of the other reviewers missed, a novel about friendship.  He treats his friends like a jerk, and, like true friends, they are still there to bail him out.  Just read it for the fun of it.	2004-01-23

The story of young Wolfgang, especially the beginning of the book when he really doesn't understand what is happening, almost brought me to tears as I was reading it, and I am a veteran of the Marine Corps and the Army.  In the later part of the book, when Wolfgang is a teenager, he still shows an innocent naievity, since he has not received a formal education due to his refugee status.  My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that the narrative ends rather abruptly. I wanted to know more about what happened to some of his family members, such as Oma Grapentin.  It is a testament to the author's writing abilities, however, that he made me care so much about his own family members that I want to know more about them.  Excellent book.	2003-09-27

This would make a good book for an airline flight or some time when you have a few hours to kill.  Very erotic for the time it was written, what was probably as shocking for its 1934 readers was the almost total lack of conscience of the two main characters (it's hard to call them protagonists), until later in the book when Frank starts to be haunted by the Greek while living in his old house.

There seems to be a plethora of both novels and non-fiction books now about the ravages of war and its aftermath, describing both the physical and emotional scars, now that the world has gone through World War II, Vietnam, and scores of other wars.  However, when Remarque was writing, there was very little literature of this sort.  He nailed it early on, when the Allies were still celebrating their triumphs after the War to End All Wars, and no one outside Germany really cared what happened there.  In the West, even today, we have been conditioned to think of Germany during the World Wars as an army of emotionless automatons who blindly followed orders and suffered no moral apprehension.  This novel, and others by Remarque, show this to be untrue.  The Germans died, cried, loved, lost, and suffered, both physically and emotionally, as much as any soldier of any army.  This is the fitting sequel to \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" (Paul Baumer even gets a passing mention as the protagonists remember lost comrades), and while it lacks the grit and guts of Remarque's wartime novel, it shows the sense of loss, grief, and hopelessness felt by many on both sides after the Great War, and other wars as well.	2002-11-08

Some of these are fairly well-known, such as the Battle of the Crater, when hundreds of Union troops marched into a huge crater created when engineers blew up an ammo dump, only to have Confederate soldiers simply stand on the rim of the crater and fire down on them at point-blank range; while others are stories previously unknown to me.  I was unaware that President Lincoln appointed a number of generals from foreign countries, particularly Germany.  There were some German generals in the Northern Army who spoke no English.  There also seemed to be plenty of drunken generals, according to this book.  There seemed to be a special level of incompetence in this war; I guess the drunkards and incompetents were balanced out by the Lees and Grants.	2002-07-28

I have read both 'Nuremberg' by Persico and 'Nuremberg Diary' by Gilbert, and I feel that these books can all interplay with one another.  'Nuremberg' is the overall story of the trial and its main characters.  'Nuremberg Diary' takes us behinds the scenes, so that we see more of the psyche of the Nazis.  And finally, this book, 'Interrogations', is a worthy prequel.  These are the pre-trial interviews, an area that has been overlooked in the main by chroniclers of the war crimes trials.  Here we get testimony concerning Albert Speer's alleged plot to kill Hitler and his cronies; the testimony of Robert Ley, which is often overlooked as he committed suicide before the trials began; and the mystery of Hess's 'amnesia.'  Also, some sobering testimony from extermination camp guards, discussing how they hated working in the crematorium because of the smell, but they got used to it enough that they could eat a sandwich while working.  Recommended.	2002-07-19

This book imparts that more than a million people have been killed and eaten by tigers in the course of human history.  There are also chapters on African lions (including a great capsule story of the Man-Eaters of Tsavo), leopards (which rival tigers in India as man-eaters), wolves (of which there are almost no known cases of them killing man in Europe or North America), and cougars, which are deadlier than I had realized.  There are also chapters on more cold-blooded denizens, sharks and crocodilians.  Very entertaining, though you'll reconsider letting your kids play outside for a while.	2002-06-22

I found the history of the Nantucket whalers to be interesting, but it seems that the ecological impact caused by these men is not examined in detail.  I'm not talking of \\"whaling is bad and whalers are evil\\"; I think this has already been examined exhaustively.  Rather, the impact that whaling had on many island and ocean ecosystems.  I realize that men were not as savvy about the environment and their impact on it in the early 1800s, but surely one thinks they would have realized something was going awry when the Nantucket whaling industry started out around the home island, then the whales there disappeared and they had to venture farther out into the Atlantic; eventually exhausting that supply of whales and having to round the Horn and hunt in the forbidding, and largely unknown, Pacific Ocean.<BR>   <BR>There are two vignettes worth mentioning:  One is a stop on the Galapagos Islands, for food and fresh water.  They gather up as many Galapagos tortoises as they can find, for use as fresh meat at sea since the creatures supposedly required no food or water for months.  Some of these tortoises were decades, possibly a hundred years old, and the men think of nothing of taking them as a quick and easy food supply.  Even though they supposedly need no food, some of the men comment on them trying to eat any and everything aboard the ship.  All the survivors of these tortoises went down with the ship; some were floating about in the water as the ship went down.  Then one crewman, as a prank, starts a fire on the Galapagos island they're on, and pretty much reduces the island to a charred cinder. They watch it burn behind them for days.  One wonders what subspecies were rendered extinct in this conflagration.  Another example is when the men, after the sinking, wash up on remote Henderson Island.  Within weeks, they have eaten every small bird and edible creature on the island, undoubtedly changing the ecosystem forever.<br />The adventure in this book, however, is first-class.  The whale sank the Essex roughly halfway between Hawaii and the Galapagos Islands--pretty much as far away from land as anyone could be.  I'll never forget the stunned sensation the whalers had when they look from their whaleboats and see their ship going down--and they're literally in the middle of nowhere.  What they go through from this point defies human comprehension.	2002-06-22

It is unashamedly ultra-liberal, but the little-known (and little-taught) stories of these people are interesting.  Zinn goes out of his way to point out that the power elite did not consciously create many of the laws and programs that keep the rich and poor in their respective places, but he almost always later goes on to describe these laws as 'ingenuous'.  <br />I found the story of the labor movement, from the late 1800s through the Great Depression, to be particularly interesting, covering the movements of the Socialists, the Communists, the Wobblies, and the labor unions against the capitalists.	2002-01-28

While I was not born until 30 years after the events in this novel, I grew up not far from where the events took place.  What I can say about it is that Joe Landsdale nailed everything down just right.  The speech, the descriptions of the towns and landscape; I did not have a hard time imagining the little town I grew up in as Marvel Creek.  A lot had changed since my parents were kids, but a lot hadn't changed.  There were still facets of the way things were in &quot;The Bottoms&quot; around when I was a kid.  This novel took me back, to memories of my old country grandparents, of the old men who hung around on the town square and shot the breeze, of the old filling stations where you could buy darn near anything, and of my hunting trips with my dog down in the bottoms--yes, we called it that, too, but we lived near a creek instead of the Sabine River.  <br />In short, I think that Landsdale hit Depression-Era Texas dead on the money.  I didn't live through it, but talking to my parents and grandparents, it sounds pretty close to what they went through.  Life was a lot more quiet where I grew up than in Marvel Creek, though.  Every character in this book has skeletons in the closet (and in some cases, out of the closet).  It's like a cross between &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;, and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.  While virtually everyone is poor, the blacks are poorer than poor, and are expected to know their place in the community.  However, young Harry's father, the constable, has a terrible incident in his past that does not allow him to think with the intolerant attitudes of his fellow citizens, which lead to confrontations with the KKK and other less open-minded types.  The constable is not exactly a super-sleuth, and there is very little in the way of clues or evidence until the end of the book--he has absolutely no leads (except one that goes terribly wrong). There is liberal use of the &quot;N&quot; word, and justice is not always served, and to be honest, the book is kind of a downer, but somehow inspiring at the same time.  I read the parts about the mysterious Goat Man who stalks the Bottoms at night--I actually got chills.  Highly, highly recommended; you can read it in a couple of days.	2002-01-20

I never thought I would see these creatures brought to print and screen as they are portrayed in this book and the accompanying television program.  If you were a fan of &quot;Walking with Dinosaurs&quot; (and you should be), you will enjoy this as well.  I learned a great deal that I did not previously know, even though I consider myself fairly well-read on the subject.  It is a story that has been crying out for years to be told: What happened AFTER the dinosaurs were wiped out 65 million years ago, in the intervening 64 million + years.  The book starts out at 49 million years ago, after the earth had recovered from the asteriod KT event, and ends only a few thousand years ago.	2001-12-29

Starting in 1900 and ending in 1999, the chapters chart German history throughout it's most turbulent century. The chapters I found most interesting were those of the meetings between antiwar writer Erich Maria Remarque and militarist drum-beating author Ernst Junger, which covers the period of the Great War. I also found intriguing the chapter 1906, which is narrarated by a fictional character, Captain Sirius: &quot;My creator's name is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, better known as the author of the world-famous Sherlock Holmes novels.&quot; Sirius offers that in a prophetic little novel, Doyle inspired the German submarine warfare of the world wars, an attempt to cut England off from resupply. The first half of the book is stronger than the second, in my opinion, perhaps simply because the events of the first half of the twentieth century in Germany were far more momentous than the events of the second half. Plus, I must confess an ignorance of German internal politics of the Post-WWII era. There are the usual themes of East vs. West, student uprisings, reunification. There is an interesting chapter (1986) about family traditions going away, in this case picking edible mushrooms in the woods. They are no longer able to eat the mushrooms, because they have absorbed so much radiation from the Chernobyl disaster. There is no point in picking them, so the family tradition dies out. All in all a very good commentary on OUR century, no matter where you're from.	2001-09-08

It is about the Bunker, and ALL those who lived and died there in the final days of the war.  O'Donnell was a US Army officer who was released from active duty to be a reporter for Newsweek magazine: &quot;This involved a quick shift from the rank of captain to civilian correspondent, with no time to change uniform.&quot;   It was in this capacity that he first visited the bunker, when Soviet-US relations had not yet degenerated.  Along with Soviet and British sightseers, he entered the bunker on July 4, 1945, and thus got a good look around before the Soviets closed it off to Westerners in September.  This evidently haunted O'Donnell, for years later he returned to Berlin, interviewing nearly every surviving member of the bunker experience.  What we get here is not a historian's view, but rather that of a good investigative reporter, who uses firsthand sources whenever possible.  It is impossible to write this story without some deductive reasoning, however, and O'Donnell shares his theories.  He discounts some of the crackpot theories, such as Martin Bormann's survival myth. I highly recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in the Third Reich or the end of World War II.  It is interesting to note that Hitler's death occurs approximately 2/3 of the way through the book.  The rest of the book concerns itself with the attempted breakout of the bunker survivors, the morbid deaths of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their six children, and the surrender of the bunker (by its coverall-wearing chief engineer to a bunch of female Russian medics--who promptly made off with the late Eva Braun's bras!)<br />Chapters are as follows:<br />1. The Caveman--details how Hitler slowly became subterranean, disdaining light and fresh air, and how he preferred to live underground and conduct all business from the bunker.  <br />2. The Thirteenth Bunker--an outline of all the bunkers used (and not used) by Hitler throughout the Reich--in Germany, France, the Ukraine, Poland.<br />3. The Bunker Brutus--Albert Speer's little-known plot (as related by himself) to assassite Hitler and the Mountain People by using poison gas in the ventilation system.<br />4. The Mountain People--an overview of Hitler's entourage, so called because they were the court favorites at Berchtesgaden, Hitler's mountain retreat.  Included are Hans Baur, Hitler's pilot; Eva Braun; Hitler's physicians; Bormann; Erich Kempka, Hitler's chauffeur; Linge, his valet; and more SS men, secretaries, security detail, etc.<br />5. Farewells--It dawns on all present that Hitler has no intention of leaving the bunker and will die in Berlin.<br />6. Casualty Station--Dr. Schenk is treating wounded in a nearby casualty station during the Battle of Berlin when he is summoned to the bunker.  He was not part of the 'inner circle' and thus his views are that of a 'normal' person on the events in the bunker.<br />7. The Lady Vanished--account of SS General Fegelein, Eva Braun's brother-in-law, who was seeing a lady on the side who was, in all likelihood, a spy for the Allies.  She is here called 'Mata O'Hara', because of her theorized Irish origins, but she disappeared from the scene of world events during this time.  Fegelein suffered the ultimate punishment because of this.<br />8. The Shot Nobody Heard--Details the suicides of Adolph and Eva Hitler, and the disposal of their bodies.<br />9. Death of the Mythmaker--The suicides of Dr. Goebbels and his family are examined in detail.<br />10. The Breakout--The remaining survivors attempt to escape the Soviet juggernaut and make it to the Allies or remaining German pockets of resistance.<br />11. The Flight That Never Was--Lays to rest the myth that Martin Bormann escaped Berlin.<br />12. The Double Symposium--The suicide of Hewel, Hitler's Foreign Embassy Minister (and second to von Ribbentrop).<br />13. Last Man Out--The only two men remaining (alive) in the bunker--SS Sergeant Rochus Misch and engineer Hentschel.  Henstchel, a civilian,sends Misch packing because he doesn't want any SS around when the Soviets arrive.  This chapter is almost comical, with Hentschel puttering around the bunker, making sure everything is still in working order, washing the dishes, etc.  Then he is captured by the Russians (several times).	2001-09-08

This book however, is recommended as the definitive account of the Italia disaster, and also a personal history of General Nobile. It gives some insight to him standing up against Mussolini and his Facists (Nobile was basically apolitical; he just wanted to design and fly airships and be left alone), which caught up with him after the rescue. The book really picks up after the crash and when the rescuers start to pour onto and over the ice floes. This was the biggest search since the Frankin disaster, fortunately for the survivors, there was now modern equipment such as airplanes and icebreaking ships available. Author Wilbur Cross interviewed Nobile in Italy and many of the other survivors. Recommended for anyone interested in Arctic survival, a lot of it is reminiscent of &quot;In the Land of the White Death&quot;, though for anyone wanting to know about the circumstances of Roald Amundsen's death should look elsewhere, as it's barely mentioned except to say that his plane was overdue, and some of the Norwegian people were hostile to Nobile after the rescue since the Italians did practically nothing to rescue their own people.<BR>Chapters are as follows:<BR>1. Prelude to Disaster--the Italia is losing altitude and nothing the crew does will make it rise again.<BR>2. The Impossible Dream--History of Nobile's airship designs.<BR>3. An Ambitious Undertaking--The story of Nobile and Roald Amundsen flying the Norge to the North Pole.<BR>4. The Next Big Step--Building of the Italia and preparations for more Arctic expeditions.<BR>5. Premonitions of Trouble--The flight from Milan to Spitzbergen across Europe.<BR>6. Destination Zero--Flight from Spitzbergen to the North Pole.<BR>7. The Downfall--The crash of the Italia.<BR>8. Picking up the Pieces--the survivors rally and gather equipment to survive.<BR>9. Frustration--SOS is sent and rescuers begin to head out--but where are the Italians?<BR>10. Split Decision--Mariano, Zappi, and Malmgren leave the camp to try to reach land and help.<BR>11. The Shortwave Dilemma--They are unsure if their shortwave messages are being picked up.<BR>12. Against the Odds--Italian Army Captain Sora leaves out on skis to search; Amundsen and others search by air.<BR>13. Manna From Heaven--The survivors are resupplied by airdrop.<BR>14. A Decision in Doubt--Swedish Lt. Lundborg lands and rescues Nobile.<BR>15. Prison without Bars--Nobile is held on the Italian ship Citta di Milano against his will by his own countrymen.<BR>16.

Some of it seems a bit sensational or fantastic, but it is riveting nonetheless, as Radzinsky seems a natural story teller.  I found Stalin's early years informative, as he was born Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili, nicknamed 'Soso' by his mother, in a fairy-tale village in Georgia.  His mother pushed him to enter the seminary, but he was never cut out for that life.  He later became 'Koba', and this is what he began his criminal activities as.  He was shipped to Siberia several times but always managed to escape.  He was also an armed robber, holding up the tsar's armed transports.  Finally he became the name that we all know him as, Stalin.  According to Radzinsky, Stalin had his entire life mapped out, had every move planned well in advance, and let nothing take him by surprise.  Part of this may be true, but I find it hard to believe that on June 22, 1941, Stalin let the Germans attack and nearly destroy the Soviet Army and Air Force in a few weeks, losing hundreds of thousands of troops and thousands of square miles of Soviet territory, all as part of some grand scheme.  When he went in seclusion soon after the invasion, Radzinsky says it was not because he was suffering from shock and depression, as some have asserted. &quot;...Stalin emulated his teacher: Ivan the Terrible's favorite trick was to pretend that he was dying, watch how the hapless boyars behaved, then rise from his sickbed and cruelly punish them, to discourage all the others.  Ivan also made a habit of disappearing from the capital, to show the boyars how helpless they were without their tsar.  The Boss was behaving as his teacher had.&quot;  So this was all an elaborate trick to catch unloyal subjects?  It seems to me that if this were the case, as the Germans were roaming at will in the destroyed countryside and cities of Western Russian and the Ukraine, that this would have been phenomenallybad timing.  Stalin had shown time and again that if he wanted to get rid of somebody, he didn't need much of a pretext.  <br />And in this book he gets rid of just about everybody.  Whenever someone makes an appearance on the stage, you wonder how long it will be until their show trial and subsequent execution or trip to the gulag.  Stalin was definitely paranoid and cold-blooded as a snake, but also diabolically brilliant. Maybe Radzinsky gives him more credit than is due, but maybe he knows something we don't.  Whatever the case, the book is still good reading and I recommend it so that you can make your own decision.	2001-07-10

The answer is in the book, and it's not pretty.  SS Sonderkommando Dirlewanger was originally formed from convicted poachers, but eventually grew to include many who were convicted of various crimes or had fallen from grace.  However, some men who were not criminals were also assigned to this unit. <br />&quot;This Waffen-SS formation consisted not only of common criminals, but also disgraced army and SS officers, reduced in rank and now serving as privates.  However, not all officers and non-commissioned officers were sent to the unit as punishment.  Many had been previously assigned to the SS main headquarters and were transferred to the Sonderkommando to gain front-line combat experience and perhaps an award or two before returning to Berlin.&quot;   The commander, Oskar Dirlewanger, was himself a sexual deviant, having had several episodes involving girls under 14 years of age.  He was also monstrously cruel, and though designated as an anti-partisan unit, they spent a great deal of their time hunting (and killing) Jews.  <br />The book is written in a severely factual style, rather dry actually, but is still very interesting nonetheless because of its subject matter.  I found especially interesting the chapter on the Warsaw uprising and the Sonderkommano's role in crushing the Polish Home Army, as there does not seem to be much literature on that elsewhere.<br />Chapters are as follows: 1. A Monster is Born (Dirlewanger's early years, in and out of the SS, and his run-ins with authorities). 2. The Anti-Partisan Years, 1942. 3. The Anti-Partisan Years, 1943. 4. Farewell to Russia, 1944. 5. Warsaw. 6. The Monster Dies (Dirlewanger's summary execution). 7. Judgement at Nuremburg.	2001-07-07

After Poland was divided among the Germans and Soviets, Rawicz was arrested and sentenced to hard labor in the Siberian gulag.  The tales of the terrible journey to get to the gulag are epic in their own right.  The overcrowded cattle car the Poles rode in (those in the center suffocated; those on the outside froze to death; all died standing up because they were packed in like sardines); being hitched to reindeer and dragged through a raging blizzard, where men who dropped were shot or left to die in the snow; then they had to build the camp once they arrived.  Rawicz and some of his fellow prisoners, which include a mysterious American named Mr. Smith, decide to escape come summer.  They develop an incredible plan to walk to British India.  Once the time is right, they sneak out of the camp and begin a journey over thousands of miles.  They encounter no real problems in Siberia, even picking up a runaway girl, but once they enter Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, it's a different story.  They have no food, water, or map, and no knowledge of desert survival. They run across NO human beings during this time.  They enter Tibet and find people, seemingly the friendliest people on earth despite the language barrier, and eventually cross the Himalayas, fighting cold, bottomless crevasses, and even a Yeti! (the most doubtful part of the book; this incident is also described as fact in Bernard Heuvelman's 'On the Track of Unknown Animals', the cryptozoology bible).   True or not, this is all-in-all a great adventure read.  I passed it around, and everyone I gave it to liked it.	2001-07-05

I have seen some discussion on web sites doubting the veracity of Sajer's story, but I say that if this is not a true story, then Sajer is one of the greatest novelists ever.  Sajer was a 16 year old French boy of part German blood when he joined the Wehrmacht.  He endured the strict basic training in Poland, and soon he and his comrades find themselves in Russia as part of a supply convoy.  It is the dead of winter and they are pushing toward the front lines.  They hear later that Stalingrad has fallen and Sajer begins to wonder what he's gotten himself into.  What he's gotten himself into is the middle of the most destructive war of the 20th Century, and there's no way out.  He and his kamerads endure epic hardships: blizzards, air attacks, lice, a fanatic enemy, partisans, and the Nazi police state.  Sajer leaves home a boy, but returns almost unrecognizable to his own family.  If you have any interest whatsoever in World War II or human endurance, and want a different point of view (though he fought in the German Army, he was apolitical), I highly, highly, highly recommend this book.	2001-07-05

For the reader who likes a challenge, however, once you figure out the basic premise of the story-within-a-film-within-a-story, things go along pretty smoothly, if weirdly. The horror story part is not shocking Stephen King like horror, it is more a sense of pervasive eeriness.  I thought the ever-expanding hallway, and more specifically the spiral staircase, were very cool.  (At one point, the spiral staircase expands upward away from the protagonist at a very rapid rate; his brother drops a coin which lands several hours later beside him; it is calculated that the coin fell 27,000 miles--twice the diameter of the earth--you just have to read the book).  The footnotes, and Zampano's narrative, are filled with dissertations on geometry, the source of Greek legends, etc etc., but I'm happy to say that I managed to read every one of them.  Despite the different format (footnotes within footnotes within footnotes, upside down and sideways and diagonal pages, etc.), I breezed through House of Leaves fairly quickly. A fun book if nothing else!	2001-07-04

It WAS interesting, but I found Shropshire's smart-aleck style of writing so annoying that I couldn't finish the book.  Some of it was so smarmy and self-consciously 'witty' that I wanted to throw the book across the room.  Many of the anecdotes ARE humorous, but not enough to make me recommend this book.  The entire tone is like a smart-aleck sports article, which, of course, is what Shrop makes his living writing.  I think part of the fault lies with the editor, because there are some good stories in here--Billy Martin, Whitey Herzog, etc.  Parts of this would probably make a decent movie.	2001-06-02

I had read Guderian's 'Panzer Leader', which featured some of this.  There are many accounts about Hitler's misdeeds, but it is interesting to read of him discussing minutae about various fronts, battles, and personalities.  Even though Adolf Hitler was an evil man, he was still a human, as this book shows.  The rest of the book, which is mainly General Warlimont's observations on various military happenings on different fronts, I found rather dry. P.S.  Readers who want an interesting side of Hitler should read the fictional 'Hitler's Niece' by Ron Hansen, about his early political days and his weird relationship with his niece Geli.	2001-05-29

It is a book about explorers as much as exploration, and about the people behind the scenes, such as Lady Franklin, the people who funded the expeditions, the politicians.  Berton tells their stories warts and all; the heroism and sacrifice, the back stabbing and human failings and weaknesses.  All of this makes the explorers, even the heroes, seem more human.  I liked the parts about the early British Naval explorers--Franklin, the Rosses, Parry.  They refused to learn anything from the 'uncivilized' Eskimoes who were obviously living off the land and sea; they refused to learn from the whalers who had been sailing the Arctic for decades, they refused to learn from the fur traders and voyageurs who had been living in this hostile land.  The Navy insisted on going in with large crews with tons of provisions.  They could not pick up on even simple things, such as eating blubber could stave off scurvy, which should have been evident as the Eskimoes never suffered from this disease.  Some of the anecdotes of the officers trying to make the natives understand their 'civilized' ways are hilarious.  This book is filled with both heroism and tragedy, neither of which were in short supply in the quest for the North Pole and the Northwest Passage.  Highly recommended.	2001-05-29

All history books I've read jump from one culture or geographical location to another.  This is the first book that lets you know what was going on at the same time in different locales. For instance, every American school child is taught that Columbus sailed for the New World in 1492. Looking up the entry for 1492, I also find out: The Spanish conquered Granada and extinguished the Moors; Charles VIII takes control of France; Lorenzo deMedici becomes ruler of Florence; Henry VII invades France; Turkey invades Hungary; Roderigo Borgia becomes Pope; Inquisitor-General Torquemada gives Spanish Jews 3 months to accept Chrisianity or leave; Leonardo da Vinci was drawing flying machines; and the profession of book publisher emerges.<br />The book seems a little Eurocentric but it does provide information on the goings-on in the Americas, Asia, Africa also. Recommended.	2001-05-09

They first set out on an ill-advised voyage from Cuba to Florida, where they lost their ships.  They built primitive boats which they intended to sail around the coast to Mexico.  They went past Mobile Bay, then cut across the Gulf to Texas, where they were captured by the local tribe.  Of the 300 Spaniards who left out on the voyage, only 4 survived to tell the tale.  De Vaca spent years as a slave to the Indians.  He was half-starved (as were his hosts), regularly beaten, and naked.  He eventualy linked up with some of his surviving comrades, including a Moorish slave, and they began an epic journey across what is now the Southwest United States and Northern Mexico.  He gained a reputation as a medicine man, and soon had an entourage of thousands that travelled with him from village to village.  When he finally reached Spanish settlements on the Pacific, the only thing his fellow 'civilized' men were interested in were his followers, which they saw as easy prey for slaves.  De Vaca tried in vain to stop the slavers.  This was a man who never lost his faith in God or his faith in man. It is simly an incredible journey, and one that does not get enough attention.  Though this account is nearly half a millenium old, the translation is easy to read and not at all boring.	2001-05-09

I marvelled at the amount of entries.  I still prefer its format to that of other film guides I have.  I also find it amazing that it was the work of one man.  Since Mr. Katz died, other editors have written newer entries, but I feel that Katz's leave his personal mark.  One actually gets a feeling of film history in reading his entries.  This encyclopedia is also truly international in scope, covering in depth Russian, French, Japanese, and other international film makers in depth.  I will continue to buy new editions as they come out, even though it may have to go to multi-volumes in the future as this is already a hefty tome!	2001-05-08

There are great action scenes, but also a lot of scenes involving torture, crucifixion, execution, etc.  This account may not be 100% historically accurate, but it IS a novel.  It is a humorless novel of revenge and obsession, as it is implanted into Hannibal from an early age to hate the Romans and destroy them whenever possible.  Of course, he becomes very good at this.  Hannibal in this novel has no qualms whatsoever in torturing and maiming prisoners, camp followers, or natives of whatever region he is currently occupying.  When he is laying siege to a city, one of his methods is to round up all the peasants in the area and have them disemboweled in the river upstream to poison the water supply.  There is a very disturbing scene, when several pregnant Roman women are captured, Hannibal personally exacts his revenge...well, you have to read the book.  Suffice to say it's graphic and doesn't pull any punches.  All in all told, it is a well-told story, but as I've already said, not for the faint-hearted or those easily offended by graphic violence.<br />Sequels(of a sort)are 'Scipio Africanus' &amp; 'Carthage.'	2001-05-08

There needs to be an updated version, but until then this one will do.  The writers have done their research but TRUE Law + Order fans will want more.  This is the series that gives only the skimpiest of details about the main characters lives, and the book doesn't really add to our knowledge, it just compiles all the relevant facts about the character into one bundle, usually comprising about a paragraph.  There are some unanswered questions, like why was the little guitar solo at the end of the opening theme dropped after a few seasons?  It also fails to mention that this is the series that set the all time record for using apartment doormen and parking garage attendants as important sources of information.  You could make a drinking game: when a valet or garage attendant gets shaken down by Lenny--bottoms up!	2001-04-28

They are open-minded without falling into preposterous Von Daniken-like theories, but skeptical when need be.  I found their descriptions of the origin of the Amazon warrior legend to be enthralling.

I read this after seeing the movie, and it's one of those rare occassions where I like the movie better than the book.  The book is still compelling, though.  A Navy attack pilot is reluctantly thrust into the Korean War, and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  This man wants nothing more than to come home to his wife and kids, all of whom he loves deeply.  In case you've never seen it, I highly recommend the 1954 movie with William Holden, Frederic March, Grace Kelly, Mickey Rooney, Earl Holliman.  Only minor parts of the story were changed for the movie, otherwise it's very faithful.	2001-04-28
