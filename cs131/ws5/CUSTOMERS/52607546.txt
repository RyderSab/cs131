Next came &quot;Deep Play&quot; (1999), an account of human creativity and our need for transcendence, and &quot;Cultivating Delight: A Natural History of My Garden&quot; (2001), about the way gardening elevates our souls. What fascinates Ackerman in these books is the pervasive mystery of nature, despite the increasing depth of our scientific knowledge. <br />Her approach is to select a topic that is in its essence ineffable, then gather information about it from the worlds of science and evolutionary theory,literature, myth, popular culture and personal experience, and lavish her findings with elaborately worked, poetic prose. Her intention is to say the unsayable. Here, for instance, is Ackerman defining memory in her newest book, &quot; An Alchemy of Mind,&quot; which considers the human brain and consciousness from her customarily impressionistic mix of perspectives: &quot;An event is such a little piece of time and space, leaving only a mind glow behind like the tail of a shooting star. For lack of a better word, we call that scintillation memory.&quot; <br />She is a grand, erudite synthesizer, positioning herself at the place where knowledge ends and reporting back to us in the language of lyric. &quot;I believe consciousness is brazenly physical,&quot; she tells her readers, &quot;a raucous mirage the brain creates to help us survive. But I also sense the universe is magical, greater than the sum of its parts.&quot; This is not the way things sound in neuroscience journals or philosophy of mind papers. <br />With &quot;An Alchemy of Mind,&quot; which might as well have been called &quot;A Natural History of the Mind,&quot; Ackerman delights in finding metaphors that simultaneously describe and demonstrate what she is saying. Explaining our compulsion to make subjective order from objective chaos, for instance, she speaks in terms of cartography: &quot;The brain is still terra incognita on the map of mortality, still the fabled world where riches and monsters lurk. But we've begun mapping its shores and learning about its ecology.&quot; <br />As always, Ackerman has done her homework. Her book offers a useful, evocative picture of what is known about the brain's landscape and environment. It presents current research in cognitive science, neuroscience and technology to show how the brain evolved and is structured. It discusses memory and emotion, the formulation of self, the development and operation of language, the differences between human and animal brain function. <br />Ackerman loves the clarity of fact. But she adores the quixotic, the paradoxical: &quot;Language is so hard only children can master it,&quot; she tells us. <br />Any page reveals a gem of expressive clarity.Early in the book, examining how the brain adapts as we learn new information, Ackerman says, &quot;We arrive in this world clothed in the loose fabric of a self, which then tailors itself to the world it finds.&quot;Later, talking about emotions,she says, &quot;Our ideas may behave, but our emotions are still Pleistocene, and they snarl for attention, they nip at passing ankles.&quot; To this, in a brilliant throwaway line, she adds, &quot;Emotions often provide a dark italics to our lives.&quot; These are memorable translations of scientific premises. <br />&quot;An Alchemy of Mind&quot; is a bravura performance in the field of popular science writing. At a time when books about the brain, mind and consciousness compete for readers' attention,Ackerman has presented a helpful survey of the field leavened by yeasty writing and provocative insights.<BR>                         --Floyd Skloot, Newsday	2004-06-28

Ten 13-year-old girls in a bunkhouse. They talk about boys, canoeing, boys, applying makeup, boys, building fires. And boys. They are exactly alike. But they are also totally different. One might be easily bored, one a loudmouth, another broody. They conceal much from each other about their inner selves. The 13-year-old Ackerman thinks in sensory images and hides her borrowed copy of \\"Siddhartha.\\" Why are they alike? Why are they different? Of all the mysteries of evolution, the development of the human brain is perhaps the most mysterious.<br /> Ackerman, our poetic chronicler of the natural world, still thinks in sensory images. \\"An Alchemy of Mind,\\" her brief but lush meditation on the brain, melds scientific research and personal reminiscence with an avalanche of metaphors as she tackles this facet of what she calls her \\"favorite fascinations,\\" nature and human nature. <br />The interaction of the brain's 100 billion neurons, she tells us, is like \\"rush hour on the jammed streets of Manhattan.\\" People are \\"sloshing sacks of chemicals on the move.\\" Memories are \\"the shoals of a life.\\" All true, all vivid.  It's an apt technique, because the brain is at its essence a metaphor machine. We look for similarities, patterns, generalities because they point to evolutionary survival strategies. Language itself is metaphor. \\"Pupil,\\" Ackerman <BR>explains,derives from the Latin word for \\"little doll,\\" because we see ourselves reflected in one another's eyes. \\"Windows\\" comes from the Norse \\"wind 's eye,\\" which is what they called the ventilation holes in their roofs. \\"Each word is a small story,\\" she writes. <br />On the ever-vexing question of whether we are formed more by nature or nurture, Ackerman wisely opts for all of the above. We start our lives with genetic predispositions. But the human being is nothing if not a learner, particularly in the first years. We even learn things that are not true. Hence the false memory. If you tell a small child often enough that he has been sexually molested, he will believe it, and pass any lie detector test.  <br />Ackerman also confirms what we all figure out, sooner or later: the brains of men and women really are wired differently. Women have fewer neurons, but they connect more. That may explain why women are more prone to depression, better at multitasking, remember emotional events longer and better. Women talk, men react through action. Except for the exceptions. And to some extent, we are all exceptions, and that's what makes life so interesting. Sure, we're all human animals, but what about the different personalities in the bunkhouse? What about the Shakespeares, the Einsteins? Einstein left his brain to science, but for years, researchers didn't see anything exotic. Now, scientific techniques have improved, and they realize that Einstein's brain is missing a fold running through the parietal lobes. \\"Did his cunning spring from an anatomical mistake that allowed better wiring?\\" Ackerman asks. \\"Or was it more complicated than that, created from the chemical pond of his brain, a wealth of unique experiences, and the zeitgeist of the era?\\" <br />Ackerman delves into her own brain as she wrestles with such knotty questions. For years, the sound of Ralph Vaughn Williams' musical composition, \\"Fantasia on Greensleeves,\\" triggered a traumatic flashback, because it was the first radio music she heard after a horrifying accident at sea in the South Pacific. Her brain was reminding her to feel fear. But she tells us she has <BR>taught herself to control her panic by consciously turning off her senses, one by one. It is no longer \\"the terrifying emotional red alert\\" it had been. <br />Alchemy is the pseudo-science that seeks to turn base metal into gold. The human mind turns brain cell connections into a self. It's a feat just as improbable as alchemy, but it works. With rare imaginative fertility, Ackerman goes a long way toward explaining how and why. <br />  	2004-06-20

In her beguiling nature writing, Ackerman is superlatively descriptive and wonderfully present. In her poetry, Ackerman's love for and command of words are even more pronounced, more daring and whimsical, and she is positively incandescent here. Ackerman explains that these spirited poems &quot;geysered up&quot; each day during &quot;intense psychotherapy,&quot; and there is indeed an aura of oracular certainty about them, a unity and purity that seems drenched in the divine, and yet they're fully grounded in Ackerman's experiences: her Illinois girlhood; adventures in the wild and on the move flying, diving, and skiing; immersions in love, loss, and psychotherapy, a profoundly demanding dialogue that is at once intimate and ritualized. &quot;Psychotherapy and lyrical poetry address many of the same issues,&quot; Ackerman observes, but, oh, what a difference art makes.	2003-09-13

What's most disturbing about this book-- aside from the arrogance of the author who pontificates about everything from neuroscience to ethics, politics, and religion-- is how reductionist it is, while at the same time claiming not to be. According to Pinker, parents matter little, and even personal preferences (such as number of hours per day spent watching television) are all mainly hereditary. So,  psychotherapy is useless,  caustic parents harmless, and the only solution for a troubled kid  (faulty genes) is to medicate him.  I bet the drug manufacturers love Pinker. Forget about poverty and poor education shaping children. This would be funny if it weren't so sad. The book doesn't add anything new to the nature-nurture question, but it's being hyped and promoted nonstop, which seems to work. That's sad, too.	2002-12-27

To my taste, and for my money, the cream of contemporary American poetry is the three women Mary Oliver, Pattiann Rogers, and most of all Diane Ackerman, also renowned for her melodic, phrase-making prose. Ackerman's new book of poems, startlingly personal for her, details a course of therapy she undertook, holding nothing back and casting familiar situations in unusual ways. It is a marvelous, profound, brilliant collection, as moving as authoritative, and an astute, tender account of what it feels like to have a first-rate mind in the presence of an enigmatic world. Ackerman is not exactly a philosopher, but her mind tends that way, and anyone in any kind of doubt about the world that kills us all off sooner or later had best consult Ackerman's candid poems, in which she burrows away into the old problems and the trickiness of traditional ways out. Continually she invites the discerning reader to share her problems, which she exposes with stunning, phrase-making gravity in this, in many ways the most heartfelt of her superb poetry books. She is a non pareil, to be lauded along with the best of poets of the ages-- Rilke, Dylan Thomas, Wallace Stevens. We are lucky to have her and the harmonies of her distinguished mind, the startling poise of her lines.	2002-10-02

I don't know which I admire more-- her integrity, her passion, or  the poetry of her language. I've read and reread it and will  read it  again.	2000-07-17

Another glorious Paul West novel, with an array of fascinating characters and prose that's so much fun to read. It really humanized the heroes of the Old West for me. I loved it!	2000-06-28

I found this a fabulous bedside book, full of West's rich language and wit, and packed with fascinating stories about the words we use everyday without knowing what they really mean. (Some of them I'll never use again  without laughing.) What fun!	2000-06-25

I was looking forward to reading this new book by Kizer, but what a disappointment. Page after page is hopelessly ordinary. Nothing stands out as especially arresting or original. Her early work had vitality and  subtlety which, in this book, has been replaced by surprisingly stale  language and a tone of self-satisfaction.	2000-02-26
