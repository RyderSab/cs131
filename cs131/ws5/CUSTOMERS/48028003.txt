People have fervent beliefs, and they tend to think that theirs is the only right way. This surprisingly prevalent attitude makes it difficult to find a good, non-dogmatic book on the subject. The Family Nutrition Book is my favorite of the books I have found so far. It doesn't seem to be written from any one religious standpoint, it gives an excellent breakdown of what nutrients the human body needs, with detailed yet easy-to-read explanations, and it even gives concise, easy-to-follow lists of the healthiest and least healthy foods for children and adults alike. I'm a nutrition agnostic and this approach works really well for me, so I recommend it.	2005-09-21

I love this book, mostly because it goes a long way towards reinforcing everything I already believe. Carl Sagan is such a wonderful writer, with such a real, human personality--nothing like the detached scientist stereotype. However, I can see where people who strongly believe the opposite of what I believe might not be convinced. Still a fascinating book and I recommend it to anyone.	2005-09-21

I agree with the previous reviewer that a lot of the suggested recipes taste pretty terrible, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But still, there are so many creative combinations, plenty of them taste good--the carob fudge is DELICIOUS, for example, and the peanut butter cups totally rock too--and the advice on things like how to wrap sandwiches for the freezer and how to make healthy ingredient substitutions are worth the price of the book.

This is my second-favorite book, after Rudolf Dreikurs' Children: The Challenge. Like CTC, PET outlines a clear parenting system that is neither authoritarian nor permissive and treats both parents and children like real people who deserve to be respected. PET places more emphasis on parent-child equality than CTC does. <br /> <br />The most valuable thing about PET is the communications skills it teaches, which are important for anyone, but especially parents. <br /> <br />The only thing I don't like about it is that it is kind of complicated to read and absorb the whole thing. Then again, parenting itself is complicated, so maybe that's a good thing!  <br /> <br />You can't really distill the book into one simple concept, although I tried anyway and came out with something like \\"Your child has the right to be different from you.\\" But there's really way more to it than that. <br /> <br />Contrary to what the book claims, I think this system would be difficult to put into place for a pre-verbal child; I recommend the Sears books for that, and Children: The Challenge in addition to this book for more insight into the way children think.	2005-09-21

It is information-packed, yet readable; reassuring, yet realistic; and gives a balanced perspective on potentially controversial things like homebirth and prenatal testing. Like most of the Sears books, it does have the unfortunate tendency to assume that its audience is made up of women in traditional, male-as-breadwinner marriages, and it does get overly corny at times. But those minor problems are easy to overlook in light of how terrific the rest of the book is.	2005-09-21

We intend to raise our children this way, too. <br /> <br />The book IS outdated, and I don't agree with 100% of it.  <br /> <br />For example, research done since the book was written has shown that quick, consistent, loving response to a baby's cries builds trust and communication between the baby and its parents. So I would disregard the advice to leave a baby to cry.  <br /> <br />Dreikurs is opposed to spanking, but it's because he doesn't think it works very well, not because he thinks it's inherently harmful or dangerous. So his advice to let other significant adults in your child's life use corporal punishment if they want to is off, I think.  <br /> <br />Other parts of the book are outdated as well, but not in ways that would matter as far as changing parenting techniques. Well, you shouldn't leave your kids alone in a car, obviously, but other than that.... <br /> <br />Why am I still giving his book five stars even with all of the above reservations? Because even WITH all of my reservations, I still think this is the best childrearing book I have ever read--and I've read a lot of them. It clearly outlines a parenting style that is neither authoritarian nor permissive, and contributes to loving relationships where people take responsibility for their actions. I can't recommend it more highly. If you have children or if you interact with them at all, do yourself a favor and read this book!	2004-07-30

Indeed, if you plan to parent AP-style, the book is one long pep talk, which can make you feel good about your choices. <br /> <br />However, I became disillusioned when I realized that there are so many different ways to parent and no one style works for everybody. This book is extremely preachy and dogmatic, so even if you agree with it, you still have to take it with a grain of salt. And there's no useful information in it that isn't also found in other books, so--add it to your library if you want, but it shouldn't be the first or only book you buy. It's not a bad book; I just don't think it will help very much.	2004-07-30

The sky is falling!	I'll begin with what I like about this book: The chapter called \\"The Truth and Consequences of Child Care\\" is a well done illustration of the rock and the hard place parents are driven to today in order to provide for their children while they are very young.<br />The rest of the book is a suave combination of good advice, observations that should be obvious to anyone, and Chicken Little. Shaw is right that parents who buy their children everything instead of spending time with them are probably going to raise jerks. My guess, though, is that any parent who cares enough to pick up a book about parenting is probably smart enough to figure this out already. Shaw is not right that we are all going to hell in a handbasket. Just look at the title of this book: Epidemic, rot, permissive, plague, joyless, selfish. He's just trying to make money from making people think the world is worse than it actually is.<br />The biggest problem I have with this book is that Shaw seems to think there is only one acceptable parenting style. No baby should be fed at night beyond six months of age? All two-and-a-half-year-olds should be completely potty trained? Forcing your baby to sleep in a crib when both you and the baby would rather sleep together is necessary? I've got news for Shaw: There's more than one way to raise a kid, and implying that a child is going to be a sociopath just because he's still nursing all night at 18 months (or isn't potty trained at 3, or has a parent who adds \\"okay?\\" to the end of sentences, or...) is ridiculous.<br />There is more than one way to raise a happy, healthy, well-behaved child. I'm sure the methods Shaw suggests work for some folks, but all children are different and all parents are different and all families are different.<br />Take the good stuff away from this book, and take the rest of it with a can of salt. The sky is not falling.	2004-01-31

Clean everything else with one or more of the following: baking soda, vinegar, Dr. Bronner's soap, or distilled water. The trick is to scent your baking soda or vinegar with a few drops of your favorite essential oil.<br />The cool thing about the book is that it gives detailed recipes for exactly what proportions of these main ingredients (plus a few others) work best to clean each different thing in your house, and it goes into some detail about what spray and squirt bottles work best, too. It's very practical and useful and I learned some new things from reading it (did you know that in the United States, you can't legally say that tea tree oil is a disinfectant?). <br />Unfortunately, she does repeat herself a lot, and she encourages you to buy more than you really need. WAY more. You won't save any money at all if you buy all the things she suggests you buy! I would say start out with one gallon of vinegar, one or two boxes of baking soda, one or two essential oils, some distilled water if you don't already have it, and maybe some Dr. Bronner's if you can afford it (you can use regular hand dishwashing liquid for most of these recipes). Spray bottles are nice, too, but I had a hard time finding the right size.<br />Back to the merits and un-merits of the book: The Table of Contents and the Index are well organized, but the book itself isn't quite so much. It would help so much if the topic headings on each page pointed to what was actually on that page instead of giving a general chapter name. If you're trying to look up a particular recipe, it can take a long time to find.<br />In conclusion, this is a good book that I definitely recommend buying. I love being able to clean nontoxically and this book is a huge help. I just wish I had bought a lotless stuff at the outset.	2003-09-29

But Troubling a Star threw me again and again. <br />First of all, there are way too many characters. Isn't there some sort of rule in writing where you're not supposed to create more characters than your readers can follow? There were dozens and dozens of them, way more than I could keep track of. <br />Secondly, while the \\"mystery\\" in the plot was clever in places and quite good at drawing suspense, it fell all over itself at the end. The \\"bad guys\\" turned out to be the Hispanic man and the man with the Texas drawl. Hmm, we're not being stereotypical or anything, are we? The kinks in the story were unnecessarily complicated, and jumped from one point to the next with no apparent connections. <br />Third, none of the characters are remotely three-dimensional. It's painfully easy to tell which are \\"good\\" and which are \\"bad.\\" If Vicky says, \\"I instantly knew I could trust him,\\" well, then forget anything bad ever coming from him. L'Engle tries to make a few of the characters, such as Esteban, a little more round, but that effort fails. Okay, so he felt bad about choosing evil over good. Oooooh, characterization! Or not. Vicky herself may be the flattest character of all. What's a high school girl doing in Antarctica anyway? Plus, she is an ordinary-looking, introverted girl who doesn't come on to boys, yet every male under the age of 20 who catches a glimpse of her falls for her madly. Why? How? It's just another example of how unrealistic this story is.<br />Fourth, the story drags on, and on, and on, with the occasional significant detail buried in a pile of totally insignificant ones. It's annoying to have to go back and read this babble again and again to figure out what's going on.<br />Finally, there is absolutely no continuity between this story and the previous one! Yes, we all knew she liked Adam best, but what happened to Leo? What about Zachary? Since when does Adam have a rich, amazing great-aunt who happens to live near Vicky? How did we suddenly leap into the post-Soviet world? I think L'Engle would have been better off writing this story as a standalone book rather than as part of the Austin series, because none of it fits with anything that's come before.<br />I did enjoy reading this book in parts; it was occasionally interesting, touching, and funny. But the bad writing and the insanely frustrating ending ruined it for me. What a disappointing, pointless novel!	2003-04-28

On the one hand, it's a beautifully written story that satisfied my buring curiosity about the lives of the characters in the previous two Emily books. On the other hand, it's kind of too good to be true. How many kids--even kids with talent, drive, and will--actually get to be successful writers or internationally acclaimed artists just because they want to be? Even more perplexingly, how many of them marry someone from home? The characters themselves are quite realistic, but the situations aren't. I guess I can't really imagine there being only one person out there for someone, just as I can't imagine being married to someone I'd known in junior high. (Thank goodness for that.) <br />The most confusing thing about this story, however, is the ending. The book goes on and on with ingeniously conceived, beautifully constructed plot twists and characterizations, and then suddenly--it's as though Montgomery's publisher ordered her to have the manuscript ready by tomorrow or else. The book ends definitively, but with no trace of an explanation as to how it got from Point Y to Point Z. This left me with the feeling of waking up in the hospital after a car collision at high speed, feeling fine but with no idea of what had happened to me.<br />Read this book to entertain yourself and pass the time, but don't expect it to be your most treasured possession.	2003-04-14

It is about a quirky, nice, good family and is well worth rereading.<br />I have only three big complaints about it. Two of them are completely subjective opinions about the Austin family. The other is a complaint about the narrator's writing style. These complaints follow:<br />1. I think the parents in this family are too strict with their children. To me, there's always a creepy feeling of \\"do what we say or else we'll hurt you.\\"<br />2. They are too religious to be held up as a perfect example family for my own personal tastes.<br />3. The narrator overuses the word AND. It's cute at first, but by the end of the story, my head was throbbing. I wished I could dismiss the word \\"and\\" forever, as wonderful a conjunction as it inarguably is. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and. Shudder.<br />Overall, though, this is a great book, and I recommend it.	2003-04-11

It provides great history and lots of intriguing facts about Americans who have rejected a belief in an intervening god.<br />Unfortunately, the editing is terrible--names misspelled, facts given backwards, punctuation in the wrong places--I wonder if the writer even bothered to proofread this before handing it over to the obviously inept editor. It's hard to read a book when you're constantly having to go back over each paragraph to determine what was actually meant. Also, the writer has an annoying habit of &quot;telling you what you're going to tell them, telling them, and telling them what you told them&quot; a bit too often. It seems he's trying to use unnecessary words to fluff up the pages and make a longer book.<br />The 3 stars I gave this book are based on content--perhaps it might have earned 5 stars with better writing and editing.	2003-03-28

One, advertising was suddenly becoming so aggressive that my head hurt every time I looked at the TV, computer, or street. Two, it was becoming increasingly difficult for my friends and me to find good jobs--everything was temporary, without good pay or benefits. Three, I could no longer find clothes or other products that had been made in the U.S.A., and I was beginning to be suspicious about labor practices abroad.<br />Who would have thought that these three trends are all related? No Logo does an excellent, very thorough job of explaining the details of what it means to live in the globalized world of today. This book took me on an emotional rollercoaster and left me with a feeling of kinship with all other human beings.

It's still a good read, though.     Were it more available, it would be quite controversial as it is WAY out of the mainstream. Greenberg is writing about his own experiences as a parent, teacher, and former child. Each chapter is devoted to a different topic. Some examples follow:    The Decision to Have a Child - Don't have children until you're ready to take the responsibility.    Nursing - You're a mammal. Mammals nurse their young.     The Years One to Four - This is the true adolescence and should be treated as such. These years will be difficult and you must be strong to get through them effectively.     Ages Four and Up - Older children have all the same reasoning capability as you do, and should be treated accordingly, with freedom, respect, AND responsibility.    Sleeping - Sleep with your kids, and don't force them to go to sleep when they don't want to. Everyone sleeps and will sleep eventually.    Eating - Provide a variety of healthy foods. Your child will take it from there.    This is just a smattering of Greenberg's childrearing philosophy, which he presents unapologetically in a readable, intellegent format. Perhaps because this book was not printed to be a bestseller, he does not try to pander or appeal to everyone. Not everyone will like this book. But it's a GEM for parents who want to raise self-reliant, compassionate kids.    Incidentally, I've met Greenberg's son, and he seems to have turned out pretty well!	2003-01-24

It explains that kids with Down syndrome need more time and patience, but they all can learn to do the things other kids do. I highly recommend this book to kids with Down syndrome and their siblings, friends, neighbors and relatives. It's good on its own and as an alternative to What's Wrong With Timmy?, a book that covers the same topic in a much less appealing manner.	2002-07-11

It's more for adults than children. There's a lot of death, destruction and disappointment in it, and the few happy times (such as the marriage itself and the birth of Rose) are kind of glossed over. I think Laura Ingalls Wilder did not edit this herself and it was published after her death, which may be why it isn't as good as the other ones.	2002-07-09

It has some terrific ideas in it. Did you ever really THINK about the issue of prostitution? What about birth control and abortion? What do you think of the idea of making sure that the guy who raped your friend is \\"outed\\" to the world? What about the very place rape has in our culture? Did you ever realize you don't have to use tampons and pads in order to keep from leaving a trail of blood around once a month? Did you ever think about a trail of blood as possibly being a GOOD thing? <br />Plus, Muscio gives the best quote I've ever heard about condoms. I don't know if it's original, but if it is, I'd like to shake her hand. \\"Men who refuse to wear condoms do not deserve to have sex with anyone except for other men who refuse to wear condoms.\\" Hahahaha!<br />I have to downrate this book, though, because it's obviously just a long rant--a GOOD long rant with lots of interesting ideas, but just a rant nonetheless. It's a set of opinions that belong to one college-educated white lesbian. Some of the ideas are a little extreme. (Okay, a lot extreme.) The whole idea of menstrual cramps was concocted by the ibuprofen manufacturers? Please, if only it were that simple! <br />But, overall I think this is a great book to read and I do recommend it even if I don't take the whole thing seriously.	2002-07-09

I was totally drawn in by the horrible way the Grange family treated their only daughter (horrible-realistic, not horrible as in a horror film). I was quite \\"into\\" all 10 girl characters and disagree with the assessment that 10 is too many, although I did have to read the book several times in order to keep all ten of them straight. I was enchanted by the love story between Ann and Dave, and impressed by the very real social issues addressed in the book. Besides, I was in Rainbow Girls at the time and so I totally identified with a group of close-knit girls in an organization tied to dementia.<br />Yet the book didn't stick with me. So many of the books I read in my childhood and teens are still wonderful to me today--books by Roald Dahl, Cynthia Voigt, L. M. Montgomery, and countless others. With Daughters of Eve, I lost interest after a few months and have never bothered to pick the book up again. Come to think of it, the characters ARE pretty flat and unrealistic. Why would Irene turn into THAT much of a nutcase, fighting men instead of injustice? Why is she apparently hiding the fact that she has a Ph.D.? And how did she earn it so fast? Is any family as really, truly sexist as the Grange family? I think Duncan made a great ATTEMPT to make her characters human, but I think she fell short of her goal.<br />In summary, this book is great entertainment, but it isn't literature.	2002-07-03

My mother had to keep dinner waiting for me for over an hour because I absolutely had to find out what happened and could not wait a second.<br />I'm not a suspense fan in general, so maybe this is normal for a suspense book and this one isn't all that great after all.

I won't resort to plot summary for this review, because the plot has such interesting twists that I don't want to give away. I really was on the edge of my seat for so much of it. The characters are deep, complicated, and I can imagine myself back in that small southern town in the early 1900's that had such a stratified, yet caring, society. Often I had to go back and read the early parts of the book again in order to keep up with who this character and that character were. It was very realistic.<br />The best thing about this book is the plot, where unexpected things keep happening and I found myself drawn in to this culture. The dialect was kind of neat too--I bet it would be hard to understand if I were suddenly transported back there. <br />One thing I was thinking, when the townspeople made a big deal about an automobile coming to town and then wanted more, they didn't know what they were in for as far as the change of landscape was concerned...sigh.<br />If you want a good book to read on the bus or in the office on a slow day, this is the one!	2002-06-18

Fortunately, real life has never been like this for anyone. This book is about rape, incest, cruelty, betrayal, stupidity, and a host of other topics I would rather not even think about, much less read about. The main character is so stupid, it's hard to sympathize with her very much, and none of the other characters are worth two cents either. All of them are flat stereotypes.

By now, the wonderfully three-dimensional characters such as Dicey and Jeff are beginning to wilt. I recommend this book to fans of Dicey because it is good to find out what happens, but this isn't a book worth reading more than two or three times. (the earlier ones in the series NEVER get old) It's too depressing, and the happy ending doesn't really make up for the depressing parts.<br />I've always been disappointed that Jeff Greene, who is possibly my favorite character in all of literary fiction, is never fleshed out beyond A Solitary Blue.

It's a trip in space, a slow train ride to Birmingham, Alabama and a little nearby town called Whistle Stop. It's a trip in time to the 1980's, to the 1950's and 30's and all the way back to the turn of the century. It's a trip through the minds of ordinary people who have led full and varied lives.<br />It is told from the points of view of a number of different characters, many of them residents of Whistle Stop during the hard times of the Depression. Their world is so real you can taste the buttered biscuits, hear the horrified screams of witnesses to train accidents, laugh at Idgie's shocking antics and cry at Artis' lot in life.<br />Although this book is hailed as a comedy, and is very funny in many places, it is really about everything in life--life and death and laughter and tears, boredom and deep thinking and insanity and revelation and, as the blurb puts it, \\"even an occasional murder.\\"<br />I also like it because it has a touching, non-explicit, very sensitive portrayal of a true-to-life lesbian relationship.<br />I know this review was corny, but I can't help it.

I did not like this book, but I will attempt to point out some good things first. The illustrations are beautiful--kind of like impressionist paintings of children. Nice to look at. And the book is about an important subject--how to help \\"normal\\" children understand \\"disabled\\" children and how they're really all very similar.<br />Now to the bad stuff.<br />This book is far, far too wordy. Even the dedication takes up a whole page! The dialogues between the children are unrealistic, stilted, and far too long. I can't believe that most children would practically bare their souls to each other the first time they met. There is too much explanation and not enough action--Mom telling stories and child listening reverently as though this suddenly makes everything okay. As though listening to a parent ever made a child suddenly know exactly what to say and do! And the \\"God\\" stuff got on my nerves--the blurb doesn't say anything about this being a religious book.<br />Although the book's central theme, \\"be strong inside,\\" is a good message, the story itself doesn't do a thing to make the theme seem real. And we never do get to find out what's \\"wrong\\" with Timmy--saying \\"he's just like everybody else\\" is kind of unrealistic. Wouldn't it be better to point out the similarities along with the differences?<br />Not recommended.	2002-06-06

It's a philosophy of childrearing that is insightful, meaningful and very compassionate. I think anyone could benefit from reading it and would recommend it as reading for anyone considering becoming a parent or a teacher, though it probably would not be the first book I would recommend.<br />I like that the author writes from her conscience and isn't afraid of offending, yet manages to be gentle and non-offensive in doing so. On pages 144 and 145, the author says, &quot;If you can possibly stay home with your baby for the first year, please do so. In fact, it is better to stay home for the first three years!&quot; I agree with this statement and like the non-accusatory fashion in which it is phrased. Far from being derogatory towards working mothers, the author calls for across-the-board support for ALL PARENTS, regardless of job status, and acknowledges how very difficult it is to balance family with career. She doesn't offer an easy way out like so many authors do.<br />I very much enjoyed the gentle, compassionate, pro-human-being tone of the entire book and I think it has some very valuable things to say.<br />Yet I can't, in good conscience, give it 4 stars. Be forewarned that it is infused with Waldorf/Rudolf Steiner material. Some of that stuff is just too weird and cultish for me to consciously recommend. The &quot;weird stuff&quot; is interspersed throughout the book along with the useful parts. For example, on page 122 in a discussion about toddlers and books, &quot;it is beneficial to read only one book at a sitting because each book has its own atmosphere, and mixing them can clutter the child's soul, especially at bedtime.&quot; HUH? The parts about &quot;soul&quot; sound more like a freaky religious message than a philosophy of childrearing, and the book is full of them. I wouldn't really worry about cluttering my child's soul. <br />As an aside, the index is badly organized. I had to practically reread the whole book in order to find the examples I used for this review!<br />Despite serious reservations about the weird religiosity in this book, still, I would recommend it to anyone who works with small children. It's a valuable point of view that will give you good ideas about how to understand and work with your child rather than trying to push your child into adulthood before he/she is ready.

I could see where it would be very useful to someone who was not well educated but wanted to do the best thing for her health and her baby's health. What I don't like is that it offers no further education. &quot;Do what your doctor or nurse tells you. Your doctor will help you have a healthy baby.&quot; While this may be true in many, maybe even MOST cases, I still think it's more important for women to trust their own instincts FIRST. Just because someone is poor or uneducated does not mean she should have to give in to procedures another woman would have researched and decided against.	2002-06-06

The story is not as good as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this book is MUCH funnier.<br />I've read from some of the other reviewers' comments that their children didn't really like this book because the dialogue was over their heads. That may well be true--I read this book for the first time as a teenager. I read it out loud to my parents and all three of us were practically rolling on the floor!<br />I think this is a great book, for what it's worth.	2002-06-06

This book is long. It's so long that it might put off the reader at first. But it's packed with information. It might sound kind of hokey to &quot;want to find out more about your body,&quot; but really, it's NEAT to be able to say, &quot;I know I'm not pregnant because I haven't ovulated yet,&quot; or &quot;My cycle averages 26 days but varies between 24 and 30 days,&quot; and really know what you're talking about. <br />I can't put in words how great it is to have reliable birth control that's completely up to us, our responsibility, with no side effects and no complications. When we decide to get pregnant, it will be equally wonderful to know exactly how and when this happens and how to go about achieving pregnancy.<br />One of the best things about this book is its balanced mode of delivery. It gives all the details, but it also summarizes them very well, so it's useful whether you want an in-depth explanation of fertility or a gloss of the major points. There are many charts for many situations, and an appendix full of information for women in special circumstances (e.g. breastfeeding, nearing menopause).<br />This book is such a great reference that I don't even NEED to go back to it again and again--I understood it the first time! It's invaluable!	2002-06-03

Please don't let the fact that this book won the Pulitzer Prize and was required reading in your high school freshman English class keep you from reading it. Not only does it encompass some universal human values of compassion and integrity, but it's a great story all to itself, and fun to read. It's told from the point of view of a little girl who likes to run around in overalls, throw batons into the air, make up plays with her brother, and crawl into her daddy's arms at the end of a long stressful day. It's a great read. Really. Try it.	2002-05-28

At the time, I didn't know anyone who had had to live in a stepfamily, so I was very interested in how Kammy got along with her stepmother and stepsister and baby stepbrother. I also had had a bad experience with camp, and it was reassuring to know I wasn't the only one who would rather be at home reading a book than in a camp full of snotty girls who were always mean to me.

With my first child, I bought this book and read it until it literally fell apart. I had to throw it away because even after repeated repairs, the binding was shot. It was my baby bible, and I did everything according to Sears.    It didn't work very well.    Oh, it worked fine for the BABY. Some people will tell you that attachment parenting causes psychological damage. This is nonsense. It just didn't work very well for ME, the mother. Mothers are, in fact, human beings, not milk-making baby-need-meeting machines. I was unable to sleep and breastfeed at the same time, but I couldn't bear the thought of being labeled an \\"unresponsive\\" mother, so I let her share the bed with us, including unrestricted nursing, and went without deep sleep for 18 months, the minimum age at which Dr. Sears allows nightweaning. The sleep deprivation had a far worse impact on my mothering ability than using a crib would have had.     Additionally, breastfeeding ITSELF caused problems for me, not technical problems, but I have sensory issues that make being sucked on very uncomfortable. I'm willing to do it anyway as, up to a point, my baby needs to nurse more than I want to not be sucked on; but it didn't really help my state of mind to open the book and read about how I shouldn't be concerned about how long my child nurses, even if it's three or four years, because an attached mother will not force a child to ripen before she is ready. I was looking for, and failing to find, information on how to gently wean at about twelve months, which seemed like a reasonable compromise to me.    I think one of the things that makes the Sears books popular is that they give lip service to balance and meeting the needs of the rest of the family, which makes them seem open-minded. But if you scratch the surface, they really are very aggressive at promoting attachment parenting as the only right way of being a responsive, loving parent. If   you have already practiced attachment parenting on a real child (not the one you're dreaming about having someday) and it has worked to meet the needs of your entire family, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, please read some other baby and child care books in order to get a more balanced perspective.     I am currently pregnant with my second child, who will be sleeping in a crib, from day one. If he or she wants to get therapy over this issue as an adult, I will gladly pay for it in exchange for less sleep deprivation for me during the baby years! But seriously, using a crib or stroller is not child neglect, any more than sleep sharing and baby wearing are contributors to spoiling. Unless your child is ACTUALLY being abused or neglected, he or she will probably grow up fine in spite of where he sleeps, when he weans, etc.    Finally, I will say that the medical sections of this book are well done, as are the infant growth and development sections, which also happen to be delightfully illustrated. Even so, for my baby on the way, I will not be replacing my read-to-pieces copy of this book. I'm going to find another book with a balanced perspective, one a bit less prone to inducing guilt and self-loathing. Wish me luck, and best of luck to all of you!	2002-05-09

Travis starts out as a desperate kid and through trial and error and the love of an uncle he'd never seen before he turned sixteen, he begins to grow into a young man. Family relationships are sensitively handled: parents and children who fight but still love each other, husbands and wives who find themselves in hurtful situations, kids who are trying to figure out the right thing to do and not necessarily being able to do it. <br />The best part of this book is the juxtaposition of Travis the writer with Travis the tough city kid. Some of the funniest and most exciting parts of the book deal with the way he sees himself in relation to other people.<br />In addition, the book has a theme of finding true belonging and acceptance, which is a difficult enough thing for anyone. It is definitely one of Hinton's best books, and the most mature.	2002-03-21

I generally don't read books that include rape scenes, but I make an exception for this one because the rape negatively affected her for the next 30 years, which is what happens in real life. She is hateful in places, but hey, it's just a storybook, right? And such an enjoyable, absorbing one at that. A mature, intricate story of a normal person with a very unusual life.	2001-11-05
US	48028003	R2ENWTQA88TLO0	0060987049	70030622	Microserfs	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Fantastic	If I were going to write a book, it would come out sounding like this. This book bursts with the life of its characters and their thoughts, feelings, and actions. It is aimed very specifically at white middle-class people who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and are computer literate, which means that if you don't fall into that category, you might not enjoy it as much. Still, anyone can enjoy the casual, lifelike style of the narrator, who purportedly wrote this book down in his PowerBook as a way to help him sleep. It won't put you to sleep because it's too funny and compelling.	2001-11-05

Margaret is such a jerk for picking the handsome boy over the nice boy and for being mean to another girl just because her breasts are big. Also, who in her right mind would *want* big breasts when girls who have them get called sluts just because they wear a bra? And who in her right mind would *want* to get her period when all it means is a lot of mess and fuss? The only thing I like about this book is the insight into different religions, which is vaguely interesting. (...)it makes girls who are \\"different\\" feel like they are bad people.	2001-11-05

Jeff as a character is real and beautiful, and his feelings are relayed throughout the book as universal human emotions of loneliness and longing. I tend to be self-loathing, so I identified with Jeff on that level (&quot;He couldn't think of anything he wanted to do. Ever.&quot;). The story is so real that I dream about the characters and wish I could meet them--Brother Thomas working through a crisis of faith by harvesting crabs out of the Chesapeake Bay, the Professor working through a crisis of love by writing a history book. It's so great. I even convinced my aunt and uncle to take me to Crisfield, Maryland, so I could see what Jeff saw and felt. Voigt's descriptions are accurate and clear without boring the reader in the least. This is a book of life.	2001-11-05
US	48028003	R2YS0UR6N1TC1D	0440467012	426143543	Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great	Books	3	4	10	N	N	pretty good	The problem I have with this book, as well as all but two or three of Judy Blume's other books, is that the author expects the reader to know what is going on without actually saying what is going on. This is frustrating to a child Sheila's age who has no idea why Sheila keeps lying about not being able to swim and being afraid of dogs. I was afraid of dogs too and I would just tell people, &quot;I'm afraid of dogs,&quot; so I never figured out why Sheila would lie and say she was allergic to them--until I grew up and met people like her who couldn't admit their faults. An okay book, fun in places (like the hide-and-seek game), just not excellent.	2001-11-05

This is one of those books. Wallace occasionally goes almost to the edge of being too academic or too religious, but redeems herself by meaningful, thought-provoking ideas about what it really means to be sexually faithful: to love one another as whole human beings, to never treat anyone as a commodity to be used, to teach kids about ethics and friendship rather than simply telling them &quot;you'll get AIDS&quot; or &quot;you'll go to hell.&quot; These are some of the ideas that give true meaning and value and purpose to our lives, far beyond mere pleasure or avoidance of pain. Wallace manages to stay out of the mainstream without actually attacking it. Read this book if you long to believe that monogamy is the way to go and need some intelligent, loving reasons to back up your opinion.	2001-11-05
US	48028003	RCO8E4ROBJ0LH	0064401847	127537711	Bridge to Terabithia	Books	5	1	2	N	N	contemporary	This book would get 5 stars on the quality of the writing alone, which is such that the reader cannot put the book down once it has been picked up. But the beauty in Jess and Leslie's relationship and the beauty of the magic kingdom of Terabithia itself also get 5 stars. This is a far cry from books that assume everyone is middle-class and lives in a four-bedroom house in the suburbs. Jess's family is far more easy to identify with for children who come from families who are doing their best just to scrape by (or who need to realize that not everyone is like them). A wonderful book, one of the best, lovely.	2001-11-05

I was devastated the first time I read it, when I was about 9 or 10, because of that part. Then I read it again two years later and loved it. Please make sure your child already &quot;doesn't believe&quot; in Santa before letting him/her read it--it's a terrible way to find out &quot;the truth.&quot; Other than that, a great book, especially the parts with Uncle Feather and where Fudge asks &quot;Is this a catastrophe?&quot; and the principal replies, &quot;No, Fudge, but I'm sure you'll try harder next time.&quot;	2001-11-05

I especially like the relationship between Mina and Tamer, which is so loving and sweet, yet tinged by sadness. Who hasn't felt mutual love for someone out of reach? Because I'm white, I would be interested to know if a white writer really can write effectively from the point of view of a black person--I'm not sure I could.	2001-11-05

It is simply about being alive, whether as a person, male, female, plant or animal, black or white, old or young, ancient or modern, gay or straight, religious or not, anyone, anywhere, anytime. Don't try to pick it apart, don't try to agree with everything it says, just allow yourself to be swept into the sea of life.	2001-11-05

I especially liked the ordinary-ness of the adult romantic relationships, such as the portrayal of sex between loving married partners with 3 active kids. However, this book lacked the &quot;oomph&quot; that would make me go back to it again and again. There is no deeper message to it than simple storytelling. It's a good read for passing the time, not for discovering humanity.	2001-11-05

I have been an unabashed Cleary fan since I was six, and I would have trouble dictating a clear favorite among all of her excellent books, but this would definitely be in the top five because of the chapter about Ramona and the P.T.A., which is so funny I literally can't read it out loud for laughing too hard. Henry, Ribsy, Beezus and Ramona are destined to become classic characters in American childhood, if they haven't already, and these books have already  been around long enough to provide a charming glimpse into times past.	2001-11-05

I was hesitant to read Sorrow Floats when I found out it begins with Maurey leaving her baby on the roof--how much more depressing can you get? In true Sandlin fashion it turns tragedy into comedy, and Maurey's character development is just fantastic. As a 22-year-old woman myself, I can attest that Sandlin manages to write from the perspective of a 22-year-old woman with astounding accuracy. Maurey is a good example of someone who screws up her life and then somehow manages to learn that she is worth saving. I went through that too, and so did you I bet. Read this book if you are curious about what happened in the spring of 1973 in a very memorable young woman's head.	2001-11-05

I admit I was scandalized when I first read this book in seventh grade at the makeout scene between Deenie and Buddy, but it certainly didn't encourage me to go out and do that myself, and as for masturbation, Blume is VERY VAGUE and merely wishes to point out that this is normal, which it is, as any two-year-old could tell you if two-year-olds could talk well enough. People who want this book banned on a couple of minor details are missing the whole point of the book, which is about a teenager who is trying to do the right thing amidst a whole lot of physical and emotional barriers. A good read.	2001-11-05

When I came across this book in a bookstore, I laughed so hard I nearly wet my pants, and decided I should buy it before I got arrested for disturbing the peace. I'm still laughing.

Matilda is a little girl we all might like to be friends with, and the social commentary is great.

That said, this is an absolutely wonderful book for anyone who is fed up with living in a world that echoes with the screams of all people who are beaten into the ground by the oligarchy of world government and economics. It's a breath of fresh air that brings with it a worldview of equality and justice--and peace--for all. It's especially good if you feel as though you've been raised to believe that women are bad or inferior (and that mainstream feminism only serves to emphasize those statements by trying to scream louder). This book makes more sense than any other book I've read.	2001-11-05

It also had me falling out of bed with laughter. Try as I might to put it down, I must keep going back to it over and over again. Once you get past the shocking revolting tragic parts, the characters are wonderfully human, and you find yourself rooting for them in spite of how revolting they are.

This is a good book and I kind of feel bad giving it only 3 stars, but it just doesn't compare with the other two books in the trilogy; Sandlin isn't quite as adept at turning darkness into humor here. Some bits of it are just too painful to be funny. The parts I like best are the parts that answer questions left open by Sorrow Floats, such as what happened to Lloyd and Brad and Auburn and some other people. Also, I like the ending; it's uplifting. If I were Sandlin, I would write a fourth book where Lydia, Sam, Maurey, and Shannon all have kids at the same time and the four kids wreak havoc on the entire Western world. Just my suggestion.	2001-11-05

She did in-depth research of the school systems, which involved multiple trips to Japan (her kids were not primarily schooled in Japanese) and a huge amount of observation, study, and interviewing. I would have given this book 5 stars except that I didn't want to appear to be biased in my aunt's favor!	2001-11-04

Perhaps we will consider a UC for our second, but this book convinced me that the benefits of UC are mostly emotional and not physical. <br />The book is a good, interesting read, and would make a great addition to a library of childbirth books that all follow the same cattle-prod lines of doctors, epidurals, episiotomies and bossy hospital staff. It is great for helping couples realize that there are other options. It is great for the nonconformist and the educated person, even if she ends up not following its advice. And it's good in that there is lots of information for fathers, not just mothers.<br />Unfortunately, it is not without some drawbacks. The author doesn't do a very good job of masking her bias towards a Christian (Catholic?) perspective. There is a lot of reference to Jesus  Christ in the anecdotes, which is fine for some people, but if you're not Christian you probably won't find it valuable. The weirdest parts of the book are the sections on society: the author lumps &quot;teenage pregnancy, out of wedlock babies, abortion, surrogate parenting, fertility drugs, in vitro fertilization, pornography, prostitution, adultery, and sexually transmitted diseases&quot; together with &quot;cohabitation, homosexuality, cross-dressing and unions between partners of an age difference wide enough to be a parent-child situation&quot; all together as &quot;deviant behavior&quot;! There is also the subtle idea that it is &quot;selfish&quot; to plan to have three or fewer children. <br />Overall, I would say this book is worth reading, especially if you haven't read anything about unassisted childbirth before, but it shouldn't be the only childbirth book you read. Happy learning!	2001-09-12

But I think all expectant parents (and especially those who intend to purposely not make it to the hospital on time) should read it for information. It could be information that saves a life!<br />The funniest part of this book was on page 37, &quot;It is important to the eternal destiny of the baby that he be baptized&quot; in the event that it looks like his life is in danger. I laughed really hard and called my pregnant friend long distance to tell her about it, and she laughed really hard too. Maybe the fact that I found this so amusing means I'm not mature enough to have kids yet. :) It just seemed so out of place to have religious instruction in the midst of this otherwise step-by-step scientific instructional guide.	2001-08-08

Both books (they are quite similar) have many, many names, with fascinating information, including definitions and lists of nicknames and famous people who have those names, in a simple, easy-to-read alphabetical listing. (This book has a little more information, but the other book has the Girls' Section first, which is my preference.) I could sit and read this book for hours, it's so interesting. I think Wallace's baby name books are far, FAR better than any other baby name books out there. Of course, I don't have kids yet, so those of you who are trying to find actual baby names may not be as fascinated as I am with the history of names like Ethelbert and Adelaide. Still, I think prospective parents would do well to read this book and maybe find names they hadn't thought of, or more information about old favorites to help tip the balance. After all, this is one decision you will make that will influence your child for the rest of his or her life!	2001-08-08
