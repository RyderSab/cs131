When We Were Orphans is the story of Christopher Banks, a man whose parents disappeared in China years ago. The case has never been solved, and Banks returns to try and solve it. He finds the country in the midst of a war, which hampers his efforts to find his parents. <br /> <br />I have mixed reviews about this book. It is well-written; and at parts very entertaining (especially when Christopher is back in Shanghai). I also liked that it had an \\"unreliable narrator\\", it made a nice twist to the story. About half way through the book it's evident that Mr.Banks isn't quite all there. But the problem I had with the book is that it's never made clear to the reader just how \\"with it\\" Banks is. Is he even a detective, or is that all in his mind, too? How in the world did he become a \\"great\\" detective when he's so pathetically clueless? Why does everyone treat him as a world-class detective? And for God's sake, Why was this looney allowed to adopt a 10 year old girl? That and many other questions made the plot fall apart a bit. I'd recommend this book only to a die-hard Ishiguro fan, and only then with a word of caution!	2005-06-07

Louis Belk is assigned to Alaska after completing his bomb recovery training. Not just ordinary bombs, these are \\"loaded\\" air balloons floating in from Japan. Almost as problamatic as the balloons is Louis's commanding officer, a tyranical lunatic who is set on being the one to crack the secrets of the balloon bombs.  <br /> <br />This book is very well written, and exciting enough to keep you reading well into the night. The characters are interesting. Although I gave the book five stars because it is so readable and hard to put down; I did find a few flaws with it. Most notable is that the characters and their motives aren't always fully explained. But despite that, this book is still an excellent read. It reminded me of The Kite Runner; if you liked that book, you'll probably like this one too.	2005-06-04

Gilead is written from the perspective of John Ames, an elderly minister in a small town church. When he learns he's dying, he starts a journal to leave for his young son. The journal relates everything from theology to family history. <br /> <br />I was so excited to read this book. I live in small town Iowa, and have all my life. I was interested to see how we would be portrayed. However there's very little in this book about living in a small town, or even the characters. Most of the book is about the Reverend's views on life and religion, which is where the author lost me. The few interesting parts--such as the Grandfather who was an abolitionist--are never expounded on, just briefly mentioned and then forgotten.Even the lives of the main characters are barely touched upon. While the book is wonderfully written, I think it's one of those books that you have to be really in the mood for to read it. Maybe I'll try it again in a few years.	2005-06-01

In Atonement, a 13 year old girl does something dramatic that she'll regret for the rest of her life. Her actions greatly affect the lives of her sister Cecilia, and Cecilia's friend childhood friend Robbie.  <br /> <br />This book is superbly written; the prose is just wonderful. McEwan does an excellent job of describing the characters, and letting us see things through their eyes. The story itself is very entertaining, and has some twists in it to keep you guessing. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves literature.	2005-05-30

Shutter Island is about Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal sent to Shutter Island to investigate a missing woman. Things look suspicious right off the bat, and Teddy (and his partner Chuck) start to realize that things aren't what they seem.<br /><br />I thought this book was well-written; and the hugest selling point for me was the twist in the ending. In fact, I'd advise you not to read ahead in the other reviews (some which contain spoilers), so the ending is a surprise. A very entertaining book!	2005-05-26
US	17076751	R38CQNKPDCVNWF	0345360338	74059498	Falls the Shadow	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Combination of fact and fiction.	Falls the Shadow is the second book in Penman's Welsh trilogy. However, like the first one--Here Be Dragons--this epic book can stand alone by itself. In this book, we follow the rise of Simon de Monfort, a man who acquires an Earldom for himself. He falls in love with Nell, King Henry's sister, and the two marry despite disapproval. Simon becomes a Reformer, trying to change England's laws that greatly favor the nobility. Also in this book--although not mentioned as much--is the story of Wales. Llewelyn Fawr's son Davydd and son Gryffyd are predictably at war. This war ends up pitting brother against brother; father against son.<br /><br />Once again, Penman does a remarkable job of mixing facts with fiction. The battle-scenes are grusomely real; this book certainly won't be mistaken for a Romance novel. Especially interesting to me were the court intrigues. Although this book is long (almost 600 pages), it is well worth it!	2005-05-23

They have very little in common but one thing: they were all wronged by the same woman, a \\"man-eater\\" named Zenia. Zenia blew into their lives at different times, leaving a wake of destruction in her path. For the past five years, they've believed that Zenia is dead. Now, they find out that she is alive. What does she want? Why did she fake her own death? Who is she? The three women ask themselves these questions and more. <br /> <br />What I loved about this book is that nothing is certain. Just when you think you've got it all figured out, a new twist is introduced into the plot. Truth really is an illusion in this book. This is one of those books that will keep you reading late into the night to find out what happens!	2005-05-17
US	17076751	R2Y6NB4XM5C72R	1400062314	9571448	Prep: A Novel	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Interesting fish-out-of-water story.	\\"Prep\\" is about a teenage Midwestern girl named Lee, who out of the blue decides to apply to boarding school. Surprised when she's actually accepted, she isn't sure if she wants to go, but feels she has to. What follows is four years of Lee feeling she doesn't really belong because of who she is and where she comes from. <br /> <br />I found it easy to relate to Lee; I think most of us remember what it was like to be anxious and insecure during our teenage years. That being said, I didn't particularly like Lee. She is snobby and stereotypical; and just doesn't seem to get that \\"life is what you make it\\". She keeps expecting Ault to transform her life, but doesn't want to put any effort into it herself. I thought it was kind of sad: she isn't happy at Ault, but feels it will be too degrading to go back home. But despite not liking the protaganist, I really enjoyed this book. The book was well-written, and I thought the author did a great job of getting inside Lee's mind. An interesting take on the traditional fish-out-of-water theme.	2005-05-14

This book is the third installment in the \\"No.1 Ladies Detective Angency\\" series. Once again, Precious Ramotswe is solving mysteries for her fellow Botswanas. The mysteries include a case of poisoning, and a wild orphan boy found wandering in the bush. Also in this one, Mr. Matekoni is having a personal crises, and Mma Makutsi is promoted to manage the garage. <br /> <br />As in the first two books in the series, this book is very well-written and the descriptions of Botswana are breathtaking. Although I loved this book, I found it not quite as engaging as the first two books were; I think because the mysteries in this one are a  bit more mundane. But it's still an excellent book, and I highly recommend it to anyone--especially if you're looking for something a bit more unique!	2005-05-11

Carrie has had a rough life: her stepfather is an abusive alcoholic who can't hold a job, her mother ignores her or emotionally abuses her, and she's picked on in school. The only friend she has is her six-year-old sister Emma. <br /> <br />I thought this book was very well written, and hard to put down. There are plenty of twists in the book to keep you guessing about what's going to happen next. There is a lot of child abuse in the book though; so some parts are hard to read.  <br /> <br />	2005-05-09

This book is about Chris and Emily, childhood friends who fall in love and start dating as teenagers. Their parents are also close friends; and the whole group is like one big happy family. Tragedy strikes however when the two teens are brought into the hospital; Emily shot to death and Chris wounded. Chris tells investigators that it was a botched suicide pact; as secrets start coming out though they believe he is lying. <br /> <br />Like many other of Picoult's books, this one has it's share of twists and turns that make it hard to put down. I felt she also did a good job of describing what Emily was feeling, and what may have led her to suicide. What I didn't find as believable as Chris's character: I think most teenagers in his situation would've handled it differently. Also, I felt that Jordan--the lawyer--was stereotypical, as well as ridiculous in some aspects: How many lawyers are going to insist on eating Cocoa Krispies the morning before a trial for good luck? And how many are going to put their clients on the stand without knowing what they'll be saying? Not many, I would reckon. But in spite of the unrealistic courtroom theatrics, this book is still good. A perfect pick if you're looking for something involving but still light.	2005-05-07

One thing I absolutely love about Margaret Atwood's novels are the elements of surprise in them. Just when you think you have the story figured out, another plot twist comes along and changes everything you thought you knew. <br /> <br />The Blind Assassin is no different. It's the story of two sisters, Iris and Laura, who are each other's best friends. After their Mother's death and Father's neglect, they take comfort in each other. Both feel responsible and bound to the other one. Just like most sisters, they have secrets they share with each other...and secrets they keep from each other. One secret will have devastating effects on both their lives. An excellent book, and one that will have you reading well into the night to see how things turn out.	2005-05-02

It tells the true story of King John and his \\"baseborn\\" daughter Joanna. Joanna is given in marriage to King John's mortal enemy, Llewelyn. Llewelyn is one of the Princes of Wales, and is always looking to become THE Prince of Wales. Although this book has a lot of well-written battle scenes, it also has it's share of romance, too. Equally entertaining is what happens in the royal court. Most of the events in the book are based on fact, and the book is very well-written. I highly recommend this book, especially if you have an interest in history!	2005-04-29

Like many other reviewers have already pointed out, this book--while good--is not up to par with most of his other novels. That being said, it is still a very readable, very interesting story. The protaganist--Patrick Wallingford--is a TV news reporter who loses his left hand in a freak accident involving lions. He then receives a new hand from a deceased man, and gets romantically involved with his widow. One of the problems I had with this book is that the characters aren't quite as \\"quirky\\" as in some of Irving's other books. But it's still a light, entertaining and worthwhile read! I recommend it for any Irving fan.	2005-04-18

Tears of the Giraffe is the second book in the No.1 Ladies Detective agency series. Once again, Precious Ramotswe is back solving crimes along with her newly-promoted secretary. As in the first book, the descriptions of life in Botswana, Africa are wonderful. Africa is more like one of the characters than just the location of the series. The writing is so lyrical that I've been tempted on more than one occasion to pack up and move to Botswana myself. A beautifully written book, and I'm looking forward to reading the third installment in this series.	2005-04-14

I'm a huge fan of John Irving's, so when I heard that Memory of Running was about a \\"quirky\\" character I figured it was on the same calibre of an Irving novel. So, I was disappointed when I started reading Memory and found that the writing is mediocre at best. So many other writers (Toole, Irving, Proulx,Roth) have done the \\"loser\\" plot much better than McLarty. It's a nice, quick, light read, but I don't feel it's deserving of the 5 star reviews it's been getting.	2005-04-12

He has no friends, and spends his time writing musings about life in his journals. Of course, he thinks his way of life is superior to everyone else's. Toole's descriptions of Ignatius attempting to join the workforce are hilarious. This book is well-written, and the funniest adult novel I've read in a long, long time.

One thing I loved about this book is that although there is a fair amount of science terminology in the book, it's written in a way that's easy to understand and plausible. This book is highly entertaining; action-packed and hard to put down. It also raises some interesting ethical questions about individual rights in a society; and the morality involved in \\"playing God\\". A wonderful book, and I highly recommend it.	2005-04-05

It's also the ONLY ladies' detective agency in Botswana, Africa, which is where the novel takes place. I loved the author's descriptions of Botswana: even though I've never been to Africa, I could picture everything he described perfectly. Normally I don't care for books in the \\"mystery\\" genre, but this book is just so much more. The main characters are heart warming, and I liked Mma Romotswe's attitude towards life in Africa--not always easy, but always beautiful. A wonderful book, and I highly recommend it.	2005-04-01

This book tells the traditional fairy tale from a different angle. What if the witch was really a misunderstood old woman? What if the father and stepmother left Hansel and Gretel for a good reason? The story takes place in Nazi-occupied Poland, and describes how two Jewish children--called Hansel and Gretel by their stepmother--survive. I thought the writer did an excellent job of describing what life was like in Poland then. Not only the Nazi aspect of it, but also what it was like when Russia occupied it before the Nazi's did. It is a brutally realistic story. The only flaw I found with the book (and why I gave it 4 starts instead of 5) is that the character's motives sometimes aren't explained very well. For instance, we never fully learn why Magda changes her mind and lets the children stay. And what was her life like before the kids come? Not much explanation is given to that either. But overall, this is a remarkable book. I highly recommend it.	2005-03-29

This book is about every parent's worst nightmare: a child with a terminal illness. Kate is diagnosed with a rare form of Leukemia at the age of 2. Her parents--Brian and Sara--\\"engineer\\" a so-called designer baby that will match Kate. The baby, whom they name Anna, has donated blood and bone marrow numerous times by the time she is 13. Her parents are now trying to convince her to donate a kidney, which she doesn't want to do. So she hires a lawyer, and takes them to court.<br /><br />I thought the author did a good job of portraying what it's like in a family with a chronically ill child. It was so easy to imagine myself in the parents shoes, and to think about how I would react in that situation. The book is unrealistic in a few parts; for example, Anna and her Dad move out of the family home and into the local fire station, where her Dad works as a fire fighter. I'm pretty sure that fire departments have rules regarding people (especially 13 year old girls) LIVING in the fire station. In one scene, Anna goes with her Dad and another fire fighter on an emergency call. She rides with in the ambulance, and then helps him move an elderly patient onto the stretcher (???!!!!). There's no way in heck anybody is going to be letting a teenager \\"helping\\" the EMT's do their job. There are several other little things throughout the book that just don't fit right. But if you can overlook that, it is a wonderful (and fast!) read.	2005-03-28

I found the author's writing style disconcerting at first; it was hard the way he skipped around in time and between the many characters to keep everyone straight. I found myself having to go back and skim what I had just read to figure out what time frame the book was in at each part. But about half way through the story started to suck me in, and from that point on I could barely put the book down. This book is the compelling story of free black men and women who also happen to be slave owners. Not only are they slave owners, but they treat their slaves just like the white slave owners treat their slaves (whipping them, torturing them, etc.). The book gives great insight not only into the slaves lives, but the lives of their white and black \\"masters\\". A wonderful book, and I highly recommend it!	2005-03-10

Let me start my saying it's rare that I love a book enough to give it five stars. I consider myself a \\"picky\\" reader; and it's rare that I'll find a book and find no faults with it. But I could find no faults with this one; I loved it from start to finish. I've seen several negative reviews on here from readers disappointed that it's not like Harry Potter (GOD FORBID!). No, this book isn't like Harry Potter. If you're looking for a light fantasy read (as much as I love Harry Potter--and I do--I still consider it \\"light\\" reading, as opposed to real literature), then Jonathan Strange isn't for you. This book blends fantasy (fairies, magic, etc.) with historical fiction (Engand in the 1880s), and does an excellent job doing so. A fun, wonderful read! I will be eagerly awaiting Susanna Clarke's next novel.	2005-03-07
