The villian was very easy to hate & the new character, Coryn, fit right in.  It also explains why the gods are so against wild magic. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like was Dalamar's fate.  Why did he have to be the one to be disfigured?  He probably won't be nearly as charming now.  And why does he get the short end of the stick all the time?  When are they finally going to throw him a bone?  Dalamar deserves better - he deserves to rule the world.	2004-08-21

It ends with Tarn & a group of followers being exiled... <br /> <br />And you get the feeling this is the last you'll read of Thorbardin because no one believes Tarn's warning of the dragon, especially when the dragon isn't where he told them it was.	2004-08-14

I couldn't stop reading.  Most of this novel takes places before DOAFS in an intriguing part of Krynn.  Herbert did much better here than on her long-winded Clandestine Circle novel.  This was a much easier, well-paced story. <br /> <br />Linsha & Varia are more entertaining & fleshed out too.  There were plenty of other interesting characters including two very likeable Dragonlords & one not so likeable one.  It'll be interesting to see what kind of villian the Brutes commander turns out to be.	2004-08-14

This takes place after DOAFS or DOALS only.  It took me a little while to get involved but did make me want to read the rest of the trilogy.  Knaak is as good a writer as ever & this trilogy shouldn't have written by anyone else but... <br /> <br />DL is about the only thing I read that's makes what more but it desperately needs a new direction, one I hope these post-WOS books give.  It needs an evil force to rise up & to stay aggresive for more than 3 novels, one to even rule Krynn for a period like the Empire from Star Wars.  This should've the Dark Knights going all the way back to DOSF but maybe this is just wishful thinking.	2004-08-03

In one paragragh he's a kid, then in the next he's ten yrs. older.  By the end, you're immersed in these characters' lives as with most DL novels &amp; there's plenty of twists.

After being extremely disappointed with the Crossroads &amp; Icereach series, I too was down on DL(a first for me)but this trilogy was as engrossing as those named above were boring.<br />I did find myself screaming at the characters to choose differently &amp; thinking 'maybe it'll end differently, maybe the Cataclysm won't strike.' but it did.  Of course, evil, as it usually does in the DL novels, stole the show.  I found myself in awe &amp; laughing at Fistandantilus's evilness &amp; how like Raistlin he was.<br />One small disappointment.  I thought there'd be a tad more dialogue between the Kingpriest &amp; Paladine after Beldinas realized his fatal mistake.  I also would've liked to have known what Beldinas's afterlife was like.  Paladine said the Kingpriest was a good man in the Chronicles.  So, did he not go to the Abyss for what he did?  I find it hard to believe the gods' let him off with nothing.	2004-06-28

One, it took me a week &amp; a half to get through the Dark Elf trilogy &amp; a month &amp; a half to get through this one.  There just wasn't an overpowering urge to see what happens next.<br />It's not exactly Salvatore's fault though, although I've read better authors.  He created some great characters, especially Drizzt &amp; Enteri, but the storyline had no urgency or sense of discovery.  The main problem is, and maybe I need to read a book by someone else to tell for certain, but the Realms just isn't a very interesting place.  It's just not infused with magic like Krynn of the Dragonlance books(not that I've seen one that is)or the originality of others.	2004-02-10

Martin(and plain despising Goodkind)I looked in an obvious place for more fantasy: WOTC's Forgotten Realms.<br />Having heard Salvatore's the cream of the crop, I started with this trilogy.  Don't get me wrong: Drizzt &amp; all the other characters are intriguing enough and, having read so many DL books, the writing style is familiar.<br />And therein lies my slight disappointment.  The best Realms writer is no better(or, in most cases, no worse)than the average DL writer.  I was hoping he would be the W&amp;H of the Realms.  Those facts won't deter me from reading more of these books but it is as I expected: The Realms isn't as magical a place as Krynn.	2004-01-08

There's a big difference. SW isn't sci-fi. Lucas said that HIMSELF. Why these writers & fans don't GET that I don't understand.<br />What went wrong? See other bad reviews to get a complete list. As for Chewie's death...inexcusable. #1- if you're going kill off this type of character, have some foreshadowing, draw it out; let us know what's going on his head, make us cry. And for God's Sakes, let us know there was no other way. None of this applied to Chewie's death. He was just gone & there was a dozen different ways he didn't have to die.<br />#2- The 'we wanted to kill a beloved character to bring uncertainty to the story & make you fear for the other characters' is almost ALWAYS a load of crap. After killing 1 beloved character, how often has a writer - or in this case, a corporation - turned around & killed another? Please.<br />As for the 'new' enemy....if you hated the Ssi-Ruuk, you're going to DESPISE these Star Trek rejects. As I read about them, all I could think was 'you killed off Grand Admiral Thrawn & TWO Emperor clones, making the Empire a bunch of pansies for this?' Like in too many other cases, the coporation - after creating a new generation of interesting heroes - failed to make a new generation of interesting villians.	2003-08-12

After having no phone for 5 days, I finally got around to reading this series &amp; agree with others: Zahn is 10x's better than Anderson(who's pretty good)&amp; 100x's better than everybody else.<br />Only one small flaw: it was too long. I noticed it with his Thrawn trilogy too. Zahn drags things out several scenes too long but other than that this duology was flawless. The new characters fit right in(especially Car'das)&amp; Palleon steals this show more often than not.<br />I still hate how the Star Wars continuation storyline as a whole was drawn up.

After spending a few years reading(or in the case of the original 40 books rereading)almost all the DL novels, I was a little tired of reading about the same world so I decided to try other fantasy novels.<br />Robert Jordan- The Wheel Of Time books were great - so great in fact that after 8 books not even the writer himself could  handle the pressure.<br />Terry Brooks- jury's still out.<BR>Terry Goodkind- One of the worst writers alive. ...<BR>George R.R. Martin- Don't know what the biggest train wreck ever is but his books are the fantasy genre's version of it.<br />After trying those, re-reading The Chronicles again was like breathing again after being depraved of air for a few minutes.

While I had to watch LOTR 2 or 3 times to get into it &amp; even though I had to quit reading Jordan after book 8 or 9 because it was taking him forever to get the next one out, they were 100x's better than this clown.<br />This wasn't a complete loss. A writer should take some of Martin's approaches to storytelling &amp; just tell a better story with it. Having each chapter dedicated to a different person was brilliant - especially for an epic - &amp; his characters were entertaining. They just never DID anything.	2003-06-01

Because of some bad, very misleading reviews, I put off reading this book, a decision I regret. If you expect a happy ending in a neatly--wrapped package, you should know by now that's not W&H's style.<br />They fixed the problems with the 5th Age(there are gods & magic again)even though they contradict the ending to DOSF a bit but they didn't take the cop out road by erasing what's happened already. Gerard was more tolerable than in DOALS & there are more bone-chilling surprises. I was surprised some old characters like Porthios, Gilthanas & Silvara didn't make appearances & that W&H let us off easy with character casualties.<br />Would I have done things differently? Yes. I would have ended the Chaos War by giving Takhisis & her knights control(although not free reign)of Krynn or made the dragon overlords(who I despised)the villians in this trilogy & had the old gods take Krynn back from them. Did I feel robbed or cheated after I finished reading? Hell no.<br />Once again, W&H have created a page-turner without trying to cute or original & boring us to death...	2003-05-18

DOSF showed W&H's ability to insert bone-chilling curiosity into their fantasy but they take it to the extreme in this trilogy.  And I love it.<br />While not as great as DOAFS, contrary to Amazon.com's reveiw, it had nothing to do with the elven parts of the story.  I love Medan's character & everything else with that plot(although I would`ve liked to have seen more of The Lioness).<br />I didn't care much for Gerard & there was way too much of him(about 30+ pages straight at one point).  There was one other thing I didn't like.  Malys made only a small appearance.  While I was repulsed by her in SOTW & the 5th Age trilogy(what I could stand to read of it)you'd think she'd be more involved.  I expected more of `The One God'.  The last time we saw her she'd gained a little honor & respect but now she's back to her destructive ways(if you think Thordardin got hit hard in the Chaos War wait until you see what happens to Qualinesti.)<br />Mina was still as intriuging as ever, Dalamar has shady as ever(just not enough of him - & Palin) & Tas as entertaining as ever.  The revelations that made DOAFS so great are still as unpredictable & bone-chilling in this one.	2003-05-18

The action's as fast as the hot-shot pilots & the relationship between them is equally enjoyable. The characters fit right in the SW galaxy especially Corran Horn.  If you're a Wedge fan this book's a must have.<br />Stackpole's writing style is very readable, the chapter average about 10 pages each. You'll have 6 chapters read before you know it.

Even if the story itself had [been bad], I'd have recommended it based on the first 15 or so pages alone. There was a meeting of old friends that was so well written it could've been written by W&H themselves. Truly moving.<br />This story had everything you've come to expect from a good DL book: good plot, great characters who become like family & the sorrow that comes from losing them. Great book.	2002-10-19

As with any book about minotaurs, there's plenty of honor & violence which isn't a bad thing in such cases.<br />This novel has many strengths: a believeable plot twist to get thing rolling(how else did you thing Takhisis would bring these prideful beasts into line without major bloodshed?), great battle scenes(including one involving a god) & memorable characters.<br />I only found 2 flaws: The KOT were a little crueler than portrayed in other books & the length of the book. WOW! While page wise it's no longer than most DL books, there were a LOT of words crammed on them pages. It took me 2 & ½ days of HARD reading to finish it.	2002-10-12

While the title leaves much to be desired - and in fact makes you weary of the book - this is a good book, detailing the time surrounding The Chaos War in Qualinest.<br />This novel has it all: treachery, plotical intrique &amp; plenty of action but it isn't neccessarily about Porthios vs Gilthas has the review leads you to believe. Give this one a read. BTW, it ends with a twist. I'd still like to know what events transpired in Silvanesti.	2002-10-12

You don't realize the extent of damage The Chaos War had on Krynn until you read this series. Good Lord! In many ways, the war did destroy Krnn.<br />Nobody suffered as great a loss as the dwarves. It's truly saddening to read what happened to Thorbardin. It';s amazing the race survived at all. The book had the right amount of plot twists, good heros &amp; villians &amp; the last 1/3 of it is absolutely gut-wrenchingly sad. A great read.	2002-10-12

After I quit reading Tales Of Uncle Trapspringer after about 50 pages or so{which is the only DL book I've EVER quit reading}&amp; hating every short story about gnomes, I wasn't sure I wanted to dive into another book solely based on Krynn's smaller races.<br />But then the author's name caught my eye.<br />I remembered absolutely loving Dan's short stories about the Bulp Clan. I dove in.<br />I laughed for about the first 50-70 pages. Almost constantly. After that, the book turned a bit more serious &amp; just as good.<br />Read this one. You won't regret it.	2002-01-16

I'd read all the bad reveiws for this book previously to reading this book but I wanted to judge for myself. Dragonlance books have been getting a lot of complaints lately but people were still giving them - with the exception of this book - 4 or 5 stars. As a matter of fact, the downfall of the series was blamed on this one book. So I decided to see what the fuss was about.<br />This book is nothing short of a disgrace, blasphemy, sacrilege! Whatever you want to<BR>call it. TSR should have had somebody help this poor woman out.<br />On a scale of 1 to 10, the style Rabe chose to write this in is a 5. A little boring. The storyline is, at best, a 4. Among the flaws, and there are quite a few, is the fact that she destroys the Tower Of High Sorcery in Palanthas.<br />The place where Raistlin and Dalamar lived. For long time DL fans, this is sacred ground. The way in which she writes it makes it seem like it's no big deal. Speaking of Dalamar, where is he?<br />The way in which these &quot;heros&quot; were brought together was stupid. The whole deal with this dragon war also seemed forced &amp; stupid. Other parts of the story just don't make sense. There's actually a dragon in the book called The Storm Over Krynn. Plaese.<br />This goes with Weasel's Luck,Galen Beknighted,The Companions,Darkness &amp; Light,Before The Mask and Kendermore as DL books to skip.	2002-01-13

There are quite a few mistakes in this book, the big one being the Chronicles said Riverwind's quest took years not 8 months.<br />The 1st big sequence was very boring too. The writers did make up for their flaws afterwards though. Catchflea was very memorable character &amp; the 2nd half of the book made up for the lackluster 1st half.<br />In all, a good book.	2002-01-01

I'm not the kind of person who watches a movie or reads a book based on the actors in it or who wrote it. A good actor can make a horrible movie just as easily as a bad actor can &amp; vice verca.<br />Same goes for writers - although I haven't read a bad Weis &amp; Hickman book yet. However, Micheal Williams has butchered every DL book he has ever written. He absolutely bores me to death.<br />I couldn't wait to read this book because I loved Emperor Of Ansalon &amp; Black Wing. I thought this was going to be another good villian based book. Even though I hadn't liked any of the other Williams books, I thought this was a can't miss. Unfortunately, I was bored by page 130.<br />I have to add this one to Weasel's Luck,Galen Beknighted,The Companions,Darkness &amp; Light and Kendermore as DL books to skip.	2001-10-22

I disagree. Soth didn't want to have those murders comitted at the start. It made references to his nobility several times. The book wasn't about his good side.

Unlike everyone else, I wasn't disappointed in the ending(even though I knew that was a bad idea). It was the way the story was written that disappointed me.<BR>This was a story that should have been told in 3 novels. After learning in the Second Generation that evil had discovered the secret to defeating good(by having respect for one's opponents), I wanted to see evil win for about 2 books. I wanted to see good struggle with an opponent that couldn't be beat by inner ambition. Dang you, Chaos!<br />It was also a little disappointing to learn that Usha wasn't Raistlin's daughter. After I learned how awesome the bad guys had gotten, I immediately thought good was in real trouble &amp; would need a miracle to win. Then I thought maybe the miracle would come in the form of Raistlin &amp; his daughter but it was not to be. Anybody else think that would have made a great trilogy?	2001-09-11
