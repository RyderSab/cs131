Book 29 covers the phase of the Second Punic War in which Scipio Africanus moves the war to Africa.  It is also an excellent book for seeing how Rome's Political machine worked under extra-ordinary circumstances.<br />Smith does a laudable job translating the Latin into English and keeping it simple.  Using a plethera of sources both Ancient and Modern the author has brought together a very helpful resource in advancing the study of the Second Punic War as well as shedding some light on one of Rome's most brilliant generals.<br />This is a must have for any one who is interested in the study of Rome, or to be more prcise, the history of the Second Punic War and Scipio Africanus.  As you can probably tell I highly recommend this book with no hesitations whatsoever.	2001-03-07

While not as in-depth as the &quot;Great Scott&quot; the &quot;Middle Lidell&quot; is priced very well and is has more than enough references and is more than concise for an advanced study of the language of Ancient Greece.  <br />I would highly recommend this Lexicon over the other versions of the Lidell-Scott series due to its size and price.  From the most advanced to the beginning students this lexicon will find a very useful place in any students library.	2001-02-19

Of course you have and thats why your here reading this poorly written review to see if their in here.  Well rest assured there in here along with a plethora of other terms, from the classical age to the modern age, there here all right.  <br />Many of the terms should be well known to students of the Humanities or Philosophy but nevertheless is an excellent resource for both the professional and layperson alike.  This is basically a dictionary of terms you will likely encounter into a foray of Philosophy, Humanities, or another such &quot;enlightened science&quot;  A nice, brief, entry in the back of the book are the diagrams of buildings from classical and medival times.  <br />I guess the only disparaging thing about the book is the price.  Twenty dollars really isn't alot but one would expect alot more from a twenty dollar book(at least my penny pinching budget would).  However the book is very well done with clear and consise defintions that make this book a must have for any student of Philosophy or the Humanities, either Classical or Modern.  <br />I suggest, nay, I highly recommend this book to any student of either discipline.  Or you should get it if you want to impress your friends, teachers, and loved ones with a dazzling new display of vocabulary (since there are alot of nifty new words in here) that would even impress Spiro Agnew.	2001-02-06

On that note I must disagree with George Delke Sr. that the Greeks were not the inventors of this type of warfare and that the Assryians were good at it (if they were the Greeks wouldn't have slaughtered them as often as they did).<br />Dr. Hanson makes a thorough and thoughful analysis of the Greek hoplites and the way they fought.  From the hoplight to the their commander no stone is left unturned.  But while the main emphasis on the book itself is the hoplight and Greek warfare in general there is much more to it than just that.  The Greek hoplights were not successful because of their bravery or for their numbers, the Assyrians were brave and they outnumbered the Greeks in all their battles, then why was it the hoplight armies were so successful against the Assyrians.  It was because of their orginization and their training (this is why I disagreed with the previous reveiwer). This then is the underlying theme to the book, not the heroics of one man but the performance of the whole.<br />The Greek structure of warfare will go on to conquer almost the whole ancient world under the hands of men like Alexander the Great, Scipio Africanus, Julius Ceasar, and the other great Roman generals of the ancient world.  But the traditions of Greek warfare would go on to influence the later nations of the European world and from there the whole of the Western World.<br />Using a plethora of sources from ancient authors, battles, archeology, and others the author has managed to write an excellent resource that is original, readable, enthralling, and most importantly is its credibility. This is a must have for any student of military history, both professional and layperson alike.	2001-02-06

P6 for Dummies does a good job of breaking down the intracies and making sure you know how to use the programs.  <br />I will say this though.  If you are familiar with web graphics then you may find most of this somewhat tedious but it will help you get a hand on the newly included vector drawing tools.  But if you are new to photoshop and web graphcs then this book will be a good starting point for you, especially if you want a good solid grasp of Photoshop.  <br />It may seem overwhelming at first but the Dummy series does a good job of keeping technical things simple and this book is no different from the others in the series.  While geared more towards the beginning user of photoshop it will still provide enough new information for more advanced users as well.  Because of this I can recommend this book for both beginner and advanced users of the Photoshop program.	2001-01-30

Jazz has not recieved much attention the last couple decades or so with the possible exception of Winston Marsalis and a couple others and while the main focus of the book deals with the roots and founders of Jazz (as well it should) it does skimp on present day Jazz.  <br />But the flavor of the book captures the smooth essence of what Jazz is and the pictures within the book make it worth the price alone.  The book is well written and well illustrated and sure to please even those who are not familiar with Jazz.  <br />I highly recommend this book to any music fan, especially Jazz, but it is sure to please anyone and it makes a great conversation starter.  Finally glad to see Jazz get some good mainstream publicity with this one.	2001-01-11

The pictures are of an excellent quality and really liven up this somewhat &quot;dead&quot; book...sorry couldn't help it.<br />The book is entertaining yet it falls short of being an &quot;academic&quot; resource.  Don't get me wrong the information is quite good and the bibliography is quite extent but it seems that this encyclopedia is geared more towards a younger audience and would be an excellent stepping stone for a child or teenager who is interested in mummies, both recent and ancient.  Another interesting section of the book is the appendix that lists where the mummies are displayed at and how many each collection has and from what time period.  So if you ever go on a trip to one of the areas that house the museums where the mummies are it would be an interesting side trip for the family.<br />I would recommend this encyclopedia for any one who is interested in all things mummies but for the serious student there are other and better works to be found on the subject.	2001-01-09

But don't let that fool you, even though this book is written about high-country geology it is not too heavily laden with technical jargon nor is it a tedious read.  With sly humor and and a witty style the author brings a down to earth (forgive the pun) approach and brings to life the richness of human history and geology in the old west till the present day.<br />If you are a student of geology then this is a must read along with McPhee's other books on geology...Basin and Range and In Suspect Terrain...but even if you are not interested in the geological processes of the west the book still brings to life the people and country of Wyoming and the old west.  Overall this is a great book and while some people may find it tedious if you have a love for the outdoors and the frontiers then this book will definately impart some knowledge unto you and is worth reading.	2001-01-04

It is a very easy to read book with thoughful analysis of each battle.  He begins the book not on Alexander but his father and traces the rise of the Macedonian power that would be passed on from Phillip II to his son Alexander.<br />The book is very well divided into two main parts then broken down again into very well thought out sub sections.  This makes for a pleasant read and also makes it easy for reference or research.  It is well written and should be able to be read and understood by the average High School student but with enough analysis and detail for a more advanced reader to peruse through and not lose interest.  I recommend this book to any student not only of Alexander but also to any student of military history.	2000-12-16

Many people  today have this romantic portrait of nature and forget that it is perhaps  the most fickle of all 'lovers'.<br />Whether you are a beginner,  intermediate, or advanced outdoorsman this book has and will always have  something of relevance to almost any situation one may encounter.  From  camping, bouldering, big-wall climbing, or winter mountaineering this book  has it all.  Including references to equipment, posture, simple to advanced  first-aid and rescue techniques this single-volume resource has it all.

With a very different and imposing alphabet I thought that it would be hard to come by.  Not so with Chase and Phillips text.<br />Even though I am  still in the beginning chapters of this text, it is arranged in a very user  friendly format, and the first three chapters are arranged so that it is  not too complex or overwhelming, so as not to discourage, but to encourage  the student to continue on with a bit of self-esteem.<br />I have not had the  time to really compare the differences between this and Athenaze (the other  Greek text) but from what I have seen and heard, the Chase and Phillips  excels the Athenaze in most every aspect of the texts.  I would highly  recommend this text to anyone who is interested in learning CLASSICAL Greek  based on the ease and friendly format of this text.	2000-05-03

This particular Loeb was translated  back in 1914 and is somewhat &quot;fluffy&quot;-it is literal in someplaces  yet very artistically translated in others.  But this is it's benefit.  If  you can translate Latin then you can compare your translation to theirs and  vice-versa.  This is an excellent method to practice one's translation  skills.  <br />Another particulary useful help in the Loeb series is their  inclusion of the Life and Works of the author.  These include useful  tidbits of where we find their works (ex. other authors) and the times in  which they wrote.  If one does not wish to have the Latin text then there  are other translations which are cheaper and just as informative (ex.  Penguins)and a little more literal than the earlier Loebs.	2000-04-26

The Loeb series are known for their excellent translations and are vital to any  researcher or historian who wants to return to the orginal for their  primary source.  Virgil's Georgics alone make this book a necessity (the  Georgics used to be standard reading before and after the revolution in  universities) and the Aeneid provides an excellent balance to the Eclouges  and the Georgics.  Virgil's writings are fairly simple yet convey both the  message and the image of what he wishes to get across to the reader.  The  Loeb series are a bit more pricey than the Penguin translations but the  added luxury of the Latin text make this series indispensable to the  student or reseacher of Rome or the Latin language.	2000-04-22

I have read this book about twice a year for the last decade and the story never grows old.  L'Amour typically wrote westerns with an occassional break-off into another genre  (usually crime, or short stories)  but the Walking Drum is his attempt to  bring to life the early 11th century and succedes in bringing another  captivating tale to indulge us.  It still has his &quot;coming of age&quot;  theme that is found in many of his westerns and the story and theme  actually are rooted with lots of historical references.  The writer may be  dead, but his work will endure due to such amazing stories, and in my  opinion the Walking Drum is by far his best work ever.  It is an easy  reading book and can be enjoyed by many from jr. high on up.  I highly  recommend this book to anyone, as it is a wonderful journey that no one  should miss.	2000-03-28

Posner has done an excellent job researching and analyzing the evidence and has provided a thorough  bibliography to support his interpertation of the evidence.  Yes I mean  evidence.  Not making some claim like JFK's body was switched on the plane  in front of his wife and the various agents and stewards on board the plane  or any other hearsay.  <br />The evidence in the book is supported with  interviews, medical research, reconstruction of that infamous afternoon,  and etc...  The book is well written, despite being bogged down at times  with evidence, and stays on track with its thesis and once read CRITICALLY  the case is closed with a very thorough and compelling argument.  <br />Posner  has done a laudable accomplishment adding this book to a market that is  over saturated with books by conspiracy theorists and the like.  I would  highly recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out what may  have happened that day, regardless of where you stand now.	2000-03-28

He goes not only into their political lives but their personal lives as well, looking at the  faults and their sometimes humorous shortcomings.  It is a very vivid and  racy history, but that is what good history does, it exposes the innermost  facets of the past, and like Suetonius, without being bias.   This is an  excellent book, not just for history students, but for any who would like a  more personal and informative look at the men behind the deified  personalities of Imperial Rome.  Not only does it include the histories of  the Caesars but also maps, genealogical tables, an index of names, and a  helpful little key of names and places of the past and where the present  day location is located. Overall this is a very good book that is well  translated and very fun to read.  It is both informative and amusing at the  same time.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, and am glad to  see that a high school student has read and taken the time to give a  review.  Not many high school students get a chance to read, let alone such  authors as Suetonius and the like.  I hope others will continue to read and  encourage others to do the same.	2000-03-18

I scrolled through the reviews so that my review would not be a rehash of what everyone else has said and was quite shocked at what I read.  The reviews more or less follow political ideology and not much on the content  of the book.   The book is written well but is often bogged down in a  myriad of proof and facts offered by the authors.  Their research is quite  extensive but it does seem to be lacking some of the critical flair that is  supposed to be offered by &quot;journalists&quot;.  Both Conason and Lyons  do bring up several good points that were not made in the regular media and  they do a good job of documenting their sources.  However, they do like to  skip over several of the injustices committed during the Clinton  administration and blame the &quot;right-wing&quot; for Clintonian  head-hunting. Overall the book is at times pretty slow and informative, but  the bias of the authors is a little more than apparent and the book should  be read critically and not filtered through one's political ideology  mind-set.	2000-03-16

The author has treated the myths Rome held important to their founding and throughout their culture as key  to understanding Rome and her culture, so one will get an excellent glimpse  of Rome and her legendary figures.  The book goes up until the time of  Augustus then it slows down.  He gives basically an epitome of Rome's  Imperial period.  It is intended for a general study and intoduction to  Roman history and is written more for the high school level than anything.   I will say that this is not a bad thing as it provides a good study and is  very simple to read.  One area that I found frustrating was, was his lack  of dates.  But overall the book is a good resource to have, especially if  one is just starting a study of Rome, and although is written rather simple  and straightfoward, is written in such a way to convey the information to  an audience that ranges from jr. high on up.  I recommend this book to  anyone who wants a good introductory history to Rome, especially her myths.	2000-03-16

Scullard covers not only the military aspects of the Roman Republic, but looks at her social, literary, economic, and political atmospheres as  well.  His use of archeology and his knowledge of the geographical lay of  the land helps bring a very scholary critique of his ancient sources and  very much brings the book to life.  It is very well written and is easy to  read while at the same time being very informative.  Scullard's History of  the Roman World is a very useful source for any study of Early Rome (at any  level) and I would highly recommend this book to anyone.	2000-03-14

The words seem to flow off the pages with a grace that is unparalleled in many of the modern translations that find their way into circulation.  Reminiscent of the Loeb Classical Library, the Italian text is found on the opposite of the English  translation and if perchance the reader knows Italian they may find this an  added luxury.  Pinsky has done an excellent job of keeping the translation  simple yet beautiful at the same time.  Dante may be considered advanced  reading by some, but Pinsky's translation is simple enough that it could be  read and enjoyed by many from junior high on up.

He examines the role that both media and education play in reinforcing the  falsities of todays world.  With the abundance of information that is  available at our fingertips it seems that our culture has become complacent  and gulliable and believe most of what we hear and see without reservation.   He holds nothing back and looks at some of the more popular ideas of our  time such as the Mother Goddess, the romantic envrionmental movement, and  the Noble Savage myth.  This is an excellent book as it looks at what we  believe and why we believe it and in an age of gulliablity this is a much  needed resource.

There are two volumes the other is  from 99 BC to 31 BC and it is just as needed as this one.

Lidell-Hart has done an excellent job of a military review of Scipio.  He has done a superb job of comparing Scipio's campaigns  in Spain to the battles that were fought in Spain during the first world  war.  This is a very easy reading book while at the same time presenting  the evidence found within Livy and Polybius in a very clear and concise  manner.  Although Lidell-Hart does not cite his evidence(I don't believe  that this was as such a big deal at the start of the century that it is  now) he does provide a bibliography of the ancient sources he used and it  is pretty easy to follow if you have a good translation of Polybius. (The  Rise of the Roman Empire would be best suited for reading before hand)  Scipio who helped Rome to a fourth quater comeback (please excuse the  footbal jargon)in perhaps one of her worst crisis and establish Rome as the  military might of the Mediterranean world deserves his place in history and  this book does a very fine job of doing just that.	2000-02-07

Lidell-Hart's book on Scipio Africanus reads more like an  action\adventure novel.  It will keep you wanting to read more while at the  same time presenting a very accurate and modern portrayal of the great  Roman general.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes a study  in history, military strategy, or the classics as it will bring into  balance the exploits of Hannibal and his eventual defeat at the hands of  Scipio Africanus.	1999-09-19
