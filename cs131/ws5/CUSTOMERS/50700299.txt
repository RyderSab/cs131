I greatly enjoyed the first two books of the series, but this one is a joke.<br />1. Everybody gets more and better powers. And even more and better powers. No, really. What a cheap trick.<br />2. Leena irritated me. The war maids irritated me even more.<br />3. There are at least two plot points that received absolutely no resolution.<br />Mind you, Bahzell's relationship with his God is always fun to see, and some of the nonmagical battles were nice. But this was as tremendous waste of time on my part.	2004-05-01

The book is extremely uneven, sometimes illuminating, sometimes patronising. While the author faithfully tries to illustrate the darker paths of paganism and magic, his repeated attempts to subtly put down any other approach to spirituality grows irritating. In addition, good editing would have improved the book greatly. The poetry, for instance, is autrocious. This is the only book on the topic that I came across, and I cannot recommend it without reservation. Use with a dose of salt only.	2003-11-25

You know, as an experienced SF/Fantasy reader, I could live with the overhelming techno and political bubble, but this particular book has some other faults as well.

The story may have made a beautiful movie (which I have never seen), but it does not pass master as reading. The characters are cardboard cutouts from the standard psychopatic egomaniacal killer to the Alex Cross'es family. There is one (yes, I mean ONE) plot twist that is more or less interesting, the rest is so rote it is funny. The writer has no skills whatsoever in building tension. He also cannot put together an interesting description. I will not even touch the dialog with a ten foot pole. And why on Earth do viewpoints have to shift all the time?

The action seems to take off and either the characters are better realized, or I am getting much less picky.

While I distictly enjoyed this book and it's characters, I am starting to  feel that J.D. Robb is settling for formulae instead of originality. I  found that ending of too similar to the previous &quot;Witness in  Death&quot; and that it was too easy for me to figure out who the murderer  was. Also, I belive that Roarke departed from his usual characterization at  least once in this novel.

However, I found this particular tale too depressing. My problems actually  did not lie with the violence of the book.

It is not bad as fluff goes, but I would not have paid money for it  (and begrudge money I have spent).  Dominic is a compelling character, but  Kyle... he is just odd.

This story is very entertaining and does not necessarily need any previous  reading such as &quot;Double Helix&quot; series or a backstory on captain  Calhoun. Of course there were still some references in it that went right  over my head.

It is rather difficult to put a symathetic spin on a person who is  essentially in training to be a torturer and finds out that he likes it. A  lot. The author manages beautifully and appearently without strain. The  society in which Andrej lives is dark and systematic in its savagery and  psychological oppression, and yet it is not very hard for a reader to  reconcile Andrej the sadistic torturer with Andrej the brilliant surgeon  and emphatic physician. I could not bear to put the book down once I opened  it. I cannot wait to see further adventures.	2000-07-08

I have seen too many romance novels where a daughter/sister becomes a rake's wife/mistress, because of her family gaming debts. I found the  changes in both Aubrey and Sin rather hard to believe, and the heroine's  heart was really too soft. (I probably would have asked Sin why didn't he  kill my brother in the first place and instisted he rectified the mistake.)  The author strikes me as an excellent storyteller. She just needs an  original story.	2000-05-30

The rest did not impress me all that much. It is always hard to review a compilation, so I really should do the stories one by one.<br />Small's story doesn't not even  deserve two stars. I still cannot get past the fact that the hero's main  attractive feature was the size of his penis. *sigh* Not that the rest of  the authors forgotten that particular ploy. Maybe one of these days they  will right up a hero with a four-incher. Right, and the sun will set on the  East. The rest of the first tale is complete tripe. It has a lot of sex  (discussed in great technical detail), but I am still at a loss as to how  the whole love thing came about. Plus, the sex might be explicit, but the  mood is distinctly missing.<br />Susan Johnson's novella rates at about 3.5.  The development of love between the characters is a complete mystery and  frankly it was wrapped off extremely quickly.<br />&quot;Dark Desire&quot;,  Thea Devine's tale has hot sex aplenty, but the hero is in no way suitable  for a romance. We are supposed to feel sympathetic with him, when he is a  totally unlikable man, who is frankly abusing his wife? And once again,  where on earth did that _LuV_ come from?<br />Robin Schone is always good. I  am glad I bought this book, if only for her contribution.<br />Should you  spend for this? Frankly, it depends on how much you like Schone.	2000-05-30

In this book, Kirk remembers the disaster on the Farragut and his first time in command of the vessel when nearly half of the crew and all superior officers wound up  dead, closely followed by his first time at command of a starship during a  battle situation, when he had to grapple with the notions of what command  is really like and when we first see him implementing brilliant strategy.<br />The story was very exciting and you could sympathise with the young  Kirk, his friend Mitchell and a whole world on the brink of  distruction.<br />Incidentally, his commanding officers were stuck planetside  during the attack, not in the comas.

Lady Daniela is courageous and loyal and prince Rafael changes very realistically from a bored peacock to a man you  would like to be friends with.

Of course, Sax, and the rest of over the top characters, including his servants, his pets and his antagonists infuse the story with a strong  nonsensical element, but that does not detract from the fun.

As it is, I would have probably given it 2.5 stars, if I could. This story is not really a triangle (especially since both Tom and Will Riker are contenders for Diana's  heart), but the romance angle is not even the most important part of this  novel. Sure, it gets interesting with the deepreaching plots and such, but  it seems that the author outwitted himself by cramming in all the info and  action. The book reads as a comedy of errors. To top that, every time I saw  what Wolf does, thinks of says, I could not quite belive it. Peter David  have never gotten him right, not in any of the books, I have seen at any  case.  And there are some of the characters in this novel whose motivations  I still do not understand. In short, reading this book is not something I  want to repeat. I had to force myself to finish it as it is.	2000-05-21

This novelization is well done, in my opinion. Granted, I have seen the ending a while ago, and I don't think I have watched all of  it, but it seems to follow what I remember of the epizodes closely enough.  Sure, I do not agree with all of the Carey's interpretations, but I enjoyed  reading this novel regardless. If only Carey ended her love affair with the  word &quot;leer&quot;, I would have considered springing for five stars.	2000-05-01

How many books have you read already where the heroine is forced into marriage/sexual relations with the hero/scoundrel because of her family's  gambling debts? In addition, we find out the the revenge bent scoundrel is  actually a softie, who, though trying to get into his new wife's bed, is  nevertherless trying to present himself to her as an unrepentant rogue  regardless.<br />Of course, the heroine hates him at first, but then suddenly  has a change of heart and climbs all over him. Plus, she comes to terms  with the fact that he had married her to enter into Society, but gets all  bent out of shape when she realizes that he is using her to get revenge on  his father instead.<br />The love/lust scenes are good enough, I suppose and  the secondary romance is fascinating. (Needed more info on it, though.  Would have been much better book.) The final twist at the end is a bit  redemptive, but Jamie's sudden change of heart is not explained. Why?<br />In  short: close, but no sigar!	2000-05-01

Evie, the heroine is young, but she is perfectly together and seems to know what she is doing. Her counterpart maybe world-weary and  dissolute, but the chemistry between them is realistic and the reasons for  the attraction are believable. The gothic mystery is an extra sweet, which  may not be necessary, but still welcome. I do wish to know more about the  Viscount and the Major, but we can but hope. :)	2000-05-01

It's style and subject matter struck me as somewhat dated. It also has a bit more of &quot;science&quot; then most ST novels, at least  recent ones. I think I would have enjoyed reading it more if it did not  involve the StarTrek universe. I'd have to say that this book is for  serious ST fans only.	2000-04-26

I loved the Marquess and the Countess was a very good heroine, different even from the crop of recent Leading Ladies who save the day. Bey and Diana are  perfect together, matched by their wits and their character. As an added  bonus the writing itself is clever and the eccentric characters that  populate the novel add an unexpected flair. I suggest that you read the  book and decide for yourselves.

This, however, is her best. I feel better reading about Regency or Middle Ages periods, but the timeline works  for this novel. Luke, who is reluctant to assume his ducal responsibilities  due to severe emotional trauma, Anna who is afraid to hope, their sheming  enemies and their scheming relatives are all dynamic and brightly colored.  Both Anna and Luke carry secrets around with them, and they are not the  ones you would expect from the hints either. Buy it. Read it. You will not  be disappointed.	2000-04-21

Book #2 was slightly interesting. The series have rapidly detiriorated since them however. This is a longwinded novel, badly written, badly edited, with the  characters that are impossible to care about.

The epidemic plot is getting older with each retelling. This particular one did not add anything new.  The book is also troubling on personal level. The society of Helena is  extremely bigoted and the author seems to treat it as a matter of course.  The showing up of the rarely mentioned Tom Riker is interesting, but his  life and reasons for joining Marqui do not ring true with me. I am also not  certain about the timeframe. After all, how long an officer attached to a  vessel can be undercover? Not years surely, maybe not even months.  Stylistically, it is flat adventure proze and it is incredibly hard to care  about characters. The only bright spot of the whole book is the first  chapter. This book is for hardcore fans only.	2000-04-20

I enjoy seeing Dr. Pulaski, who is almost never used. However, this book is mostly a waste. It is a slightly more escalated version of the first &quot;Double Helix&quot; novel. I am not sure it was necessary at all. All  the storyline plot development could have been handled in a short story or  novella. Also, the time frame for the Bajorian occupation is wrong.

I greatly enjoyed this book despite all its shortcomings, such as bad  characterization, implausable plot twists and overload on emotions.  Besides, the relationship between Stiles and Romulan captive is just asking  for some serios slash. The editing of the book also was not the best and  makes me wonder if the author actually knows what &quot;leer&quot; means.  The fact that the book is actually distinctly breathtaking promises great  things with better editing and a bit more thought to the plot consistency.

The flat pompous prose is more then a little irritating. The plot is completely and totally awful. The &quot;lost in time&quot; colonists do not even need  to be included. As it is their angle of the story is not developed at all.  Similar recovery is much better covered in ST:NG episode. The idea of  living planet intelligence is also nothing new. I have seen it presented in  much more interesting and poignant ways, my recent favorite being the  &quot;PoTayBee&quot; trilogy from (I believe) McAfrey. Loss of time and  money and not worth the materials used for printing.<br />Also, the  &quot;serial novel&quot; idea in this format is not the brightest one I've  ever seen. Not everyone is such a devoted fan of the ST books (especially  considering the quality of this one.)<br />And in conclusion I also had  problems with the cover. Why, for instance, Captain Kirk is the only face  on the cover (he did not play an overly important role)? The backside  promotion is misleading. Do the people who write them actually bother to  read the books?<br />Maybe I should go down to one star?	2000-04-05

I found this book true to the type, but sincerely more long-winded. The sex interludes tended to distract from the story by their  longitude. The villain was absolutely uninteresting. The hero was  excessively tortured and the heroine's naiviette was rather overdone. The  only person I actually liked was the first elderly husband.

If you have read  &quot;The Lady's Tutor&quot;, you will find that this book is sexier,  darker and much more explicit. The characters are strange (and Ms. Schones'  writing style contributes to the impression). I delighted in both Michael  and Gabriel and I believe that this book is begging for a sequel...

It is very hard for me to give a book a one star, but this was supposed to be a Palmer and I am a little angry. Usually her tales are sensual, emotional and witty (even if the main characters are frequently stuck in the fifties). This one is a major disappointment. It feels like an axe job,  it is so choppy. While it started interestingly, it soon disintegrated into  cheap genre standards. The heroine is prissy and ridiculously innossent for  a 28 year old (and I am not talking about her &quot;moral&quot; virginity  here). The hero is just plain ridiculous. I cannot recommend this book. If  you wish to enjoy a Palmer try &quot;Once in Paris&quot; or &quot;The  Champain Girl&quot;.	2000-03-24

I am a witch and representation of pagans in this book bothered me. Come to think about it, the author also did a number on both fundamentalist and  liberal Christians as well. Still, he is allowed some artistic  licence.<br />The problems I had with the actual composition are the  following: a) I could not figure out what had happened except in the most  broad sense; would it have hurt the author to give a more comprehensible  explination? b) There were at least half a dozen charactes in the book that  to my eyes did nothing to further the plot.<br />What I liked about the book:  a)the Angel; b)the Professor; c)the biting sarcasm about the future of  liberalism. Also the plot is fairy twisted and action packed and the  mythology is nicely woven in.<br />I had borrowed this book from the library  and do not recommend spending any money on it.	2000-03-21

(It could not seem to decide between light humor and horror). I was curious about the Natives and thought that the ending was a bit of a cop out.
