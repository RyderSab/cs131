Books	5	20	20	N	N	A classic that's still true today	For over thirty years, this book has answered one of a young child's most important questions about starting school: will I have any friends? Walking  to school on the first day with his father, that's the question Jim asks.  His father smiles down at him and says, &quot;I think you will.&quot;           Jim's a little intimidated at first. &quot;All the boys were making  noise. All the girls were laughing. Where was his friend?&quot; Like my two  oldest kids, Jim stands at the edge of the action and waits for someone to  invite him to join in. It takes awhile. He hasn't found his friend by snack  time. He hasn't found his friend by rest time. Where is his friend?           After rest time, the boy who was lying down next to Jim shows him a toy  truck. Jim promises to bring his toy gas pump. He's found his friend!           I wish my parents had shared this is a straight-forward, slice-of-life  story with me when I was a shy three year old starting nursery school. It  wouldn't have made me more outgoing, but it might have made me a little  less nervous.	2000-08-16

I loved Dr. Seuss as a kid, but I have to admit, I don't always like reading him aloud now that I'm a parent. Don't tell my kids, but I know how  Green Eggs and Ham ended up behind the sofa. Mom and Dad hid it there after  they'd been forced to read about boxes and foxes and sockses too many times  in a row one night. This new book, based on notes and sketches found among  Dr. Seuss's papers after his death, might escape the fate of Sam-I-am, at  least in our house.          There are some definite funny moments.  Discussing the cafeteria workers, the narrator says, &quot;They make us hot  dogs, beans, and fries, / Plus things we do not recognize.&quot; Although  the food may resemble that found in some educational institutions, the  philosophy does not. Instead of teaching the students the traditional canon  and rote memorization, the teachers at Diffendoofer teach an eclectic mix.  Extolling the virtues of his teacher, Miss Bonkers, the narrator says:              She even teaches frogs to dance.          And pigs to put on  underpants.          One day she taught a duck to sing --          Miss  Bonkers teaches EVERYTHING!             Of all the teachers in our school,           I like Miss Bonkers best.          Our teachers are all different,           But she's different-er than the rest.                   Most of  all, the teachers teach their students how to think. This works great,  until the day of the dreaded standardized test. If the students at  Diffendoofer School don't pass with flying colors, they'll be forced to go  to Flobbertown, where everyone does everything the same. Amazingly enough,  the test covers all the things the Diffendoofer teachers have been teaching  -- and for those questions on material they haven't covered yet, the  students use their thinking skills to come up with the right answers.           Lane Smith's illustrations pay tribute to Dr. Seuss. Several characters  from Seuss books walk the halls of Diffendoofer School, along with Smith's  more angular characters. The library is stocked with Seuss books.           At the end of the book, there's the story of how this book came to be.  After reading the original verses and studying the original sketches, I  re-read the story and marveled at how Prelutsky and Smith took a small  amount of material and fashioned Hooray for Diffendoofer Day.	2000-08-16

Froggy, who as you might guess is a frog, is nervous about  the first day of school. So nervous, in fact, that he lets his imagination  carry him away. First he has the dreaded dream about running late on the  first day of school, nearly missing the bus, and arriving only to realize  he's running around in his underwear!          When he really does get to  school, he's thrilled to find his name tag on his table. &quot;He liked his  name. It was the first word he knew how to read. It was the only word he  knew how to read. He read it aloud, louder and louder. Frrrooggyy.&quot; A  little too loud, it turns out, as his teacher, Miss Witherspoon, kindly  informs him that it's time to pay attention. Later, as he gazes out the  window, he's so impressed by the falling leaves that he topples out of his  chair. Miss Witherspoon tells him, &quot;Kindly stay in your seat, dear. .  .We'll sit on the floor at circle time.&quot;          At circle time,  Froggy shares how he learned how to swim over the summer. He soon has the  whole class going through the motions -- even the principal joins in! When  his parents ask about his first day of school, he proudly informs them that  he taught the principal how to swim!          As Frank Remkiewicz draws  him, Froggy is just your average little boy who happens to be a frog. He  may have webbed feet, but he covers them with sneakers. Froggy's face is a  mirror of his emotions -- wide-eyed terror when he awakens from a bad  dream, pink-tinged embarrassment when he notices the principal watching his  &quot;swimming lessons.&quot;	2000-08-16

Annabelle's big sister, Lucy, is determined to teach her little sister all  the insider secrets. Using their mom's make-up, Lucy teaches Annabelle the  real names of the colors, like Raving Scarlet and Blue Desire. Having  already taught her sister how to count past one hundred, Lucy seeds  Annabelle's mind with the really important issues of math, like &quot;[a]re  there numbers less than zero. . . what's the number after infinity?&quot;           Armed with an extra dose of Lucy's advice and the admonition,  &quot;Remember, you're my sister,&quot; Annabelle sets out to conquer  kindergarten. Somehow, the strategy doesn't quite work. No one else answers  roll the way Lucy taught her to, or calls any of the colors anything even  close to &quot;Blue Desire.&quot; When Mr. Blum, the teacher, says it's  time to do math, Annabelle isn't about to mention zero or infinity. But  when Annabelle is the only kindergartner who can count the milk money,  Lucy's lessons finally pay off.          Annabelle gets to be milk monitor  and deliver the money to the cafeteria. When the cafeteria lady asks her  name, she proudly proclaims it the way Lucy taught her, &quot;Annabelle  Swift, Kindergartner!&quot;          Amy Schwartz does as good a job  illustrating this story as she does writing it. I especially liked the  interaction between the two sisters: Lucy wise in the ways of the world,  lathering on her mother's &quot;Blue Desire&quot; eye shadow, and Annabelle  gazing up at her in rapt attention.	2000-08-16

Your kids might know what a school looks like, even if they haven't spent much time in one,  but to Minerva Louise, an inquisitive hen, that big empty building she  encounters during her early morning walk is a wonderful, fancy barn. She  filters everything she sees through her own experience, so that the  custodian raising the flag becomes the farmer hanging his laundry out to  dry, and the wastebasket at the side of the teacher's desk becomes a feed  bucket. The kids' cubby holes are nesting boxes -- there's even one with an  egg in it. To Minerva it's an egg, but your kids will recognize it as a  baseball nestled in a ball glove.          This is another great book if  you need something light-hearted to calm first-day jitters. The  illustrations are crisp and bright, and it's hard not to like Minerva  Louise, even if she is a silly goose, er, chicken.	2000-08-16

In Dinofours: It's Time for  School, Steven Metzger, a preschool teacher as well as an author, offers  first timers and their parents gentle reassurance about that momentous  event.          Albert, a four year old dinosaur who acts just like the  four year old in my house, isn't quite sure he wants to go to school.              'Mommy, will you stay with me at school?' asked Albert.           'I'll stay for awhile,' said Albert's mother. 'And then, when you're ready,  I'll leave.'          'I'll never be ready.'             Once inside the  classroom, Albert meets his teacher, Mrs. Dee, and his classmates, who  could have been modeled on the kids in my son's class last year. There's  the boy who never met a stranger, the girl who grabs all the cookies, the  kids who love to giggle during storytime. The classroom is pretty much like  what my son experienced: a sand table, a playdough table, a dress-up area,  an art center, a reading nook, and lots of bright colors and  age-appropriate toys.          When Albert starts to cry because he misses  his mom, Mrs. Dee asks for his help in comforting a sad little doll. Later,  when Brendan bursts into tears, Albert uses the same technique to comfort  his new friend.          Hans Wilhelm's illustrations capture the  personality of each Dinofour. In the beginning of the book, Albert clings  to his mother's leg, while Brendan zooms around the room from activity to  activity. After story time, when the Dinofours spot their parents and  caregivers waiting at the door to take them home, each little face is lit  with sheer joy!	2000-08-16

My youngest daughter loves this book so much that if she hears us reading it to another child after she's gone to bed, she yells, &quot;Boo lady! Boo lady!&quot; and begs us to read it to her again. It's such a fun tale that  we always do.<br />Once upon a time, a little old lady who was not afraid of  anything walked home through the moonlit woods. She rounded a bend on the  path and found two big shoes that go CLOMP, CLOMP by  themselves.<br />&quot;Get out of my way, you two big shoes! I'm not afraid of  you,&quot; she said. She kept on walking, and the shoes clomp-clomped  behind her. Next she met up with a pair of pants, then a shirt, and pretty  soon she had an entire outfit following her. Each time, she ordered,  &quot;Get out of my way... I'm not afraid of you&quot; and walked on just a  wee bit faster.<br />Then she got to the &quot;very huge, very orange, very  scary pumpkin head.&quot; Walking a little bit faster was out of the  question -- running wasn't. She ran all the way home,<br />&quot;[b]ut behind  her she could hear  Two shoes go CLOMP, CLOMP,  One pair of pants go  WIGGLE, WIGGLE,  One shirt go SHAKE, SHAKE,  Two gloves go CLAP, CLAP,  One  hat go NOD, NOD,  And one scary pumpkin head go BOO, BOO!&quot;  When she  bravely proclaimed that she was still not frightened, all the stuff that  had followed her home didn't know what to do with itself. But she had an  idea. She found a place for it in her garden, where it could scare all the  birds away.<br />Part of the magic in this story lies in it's repetition. My  kids love saying and acting out shake, shake, nod, nod, etc. (and I may be  a very proud mom, but nobody says &quot;wiggle, wiggle&quot; cuter than my  toddler). Another part of the magic is the illustrations. They're serious,  but not scary. At one point, the little old lady pushes the shirt out of  her way. In the next illustration, it's following her with it's sleeves  crossed in the classic &quot;humph!&quot; pose so familiar to parents of  strong-willed children.	2000-08-15

They are both witches. They both went to the Miss Mildred Mildew's  School of Magic and learned the same spells. But that's where the  similarities end. Alice uses her magic for good; Greta prefers to make  trouble (but then, what can you expect from someone who starts the day off  with a cup of pond slime every morning?).<br />Greta wasn't paying attention  when Miss Mildew taught her pupils the most important lesson of all --  &quot;The Brewmerang Principle: Whatever you chant, Whatever you brew,  Sooner or later Comes back to you!&quot; So while Alice helps a sailboat  stranded on a sandbar; Greta uses the same spell to swamp a sand castle and  sweep it out to sea. After Alice makes a lost puppy reappear; Greta uses  the same spell to make all the balls at a soccer tournament  disappear.<br />One day Greta dumps a load of sticky slimy marshmallow goo on  some children in a playground. Before Alice can help them, Greta slimes  her, too. Then Alice remembers the Brewmerang Principle, and invokes its  application on Greta. Greta gets a taste of every nasty thing she's ever  done.<br />The story could end there, but it doesn't. It ends with Greta  brushing up on the Brewmerang Principle. Maybe there's hope for her  yet.<br />Cyd Moore's beautiful illustrations add humorous touches to this  charming tale. During flying lessons, Alice straddles her broom in proper  witchy fashion, while Greta hangs upside down by her knees on hers. Alice  chants her chants in a lotus position; Greta prefers to stand on her head.  Best of all, on graduation day, all the new witches from Miss Mildred's  have mortar board pointy hats, complete with tassels.	2000-08-15

My son was terrified of scarecrows until we found this book. Now, it's torn  and tattered, and a favorite of both my boys and their older sister.

The skinny kid can hear  the sound of fiddle strings, and he looks out his window to see the  scarecrow leading all the animals into the barn for a hoe-down. Intrigued,  the skinny kid sneaks into the barn and hides. Pretty soon, though, the  scarecrow spots him and invites him to join in.<br />Out came the skinny kid,  a-tickin' an' a-tockin'  An' a hummin' an' a-yeein' an' a rockin' an' a  sockin'.  An' he danced his little toe through a hole in his stockin'!  By  this point in the story, my kids are itchin' to get up and dance, too. But,  as the night owl points out, the magic can only last so long. The skinny  kid sneaks back into his bed in the farmhouse to watch the sunrise. It  might have been a dream, except for that hole in his sock.<br />In addition to  the wonderful verse that sets toes a-tappin', my kids love the  illustrations. My three-year-old always points out the skinny kid's  progress as he sneaks out of the house, past the hound dog, into the barn,  and back. All the kids giggle at the whirling pigs, who get so dizzy that  they all fall down.	2000-08-15

The sweet,rosy cheeked teacher is saddled with a class of kids who are taking advantage of her gentle nature.  <br /> 'Now settle down,' said Miss Nelson in a sweet voice. <br />But the class would not settle down. They whispered and giggled. They squirmed and made faces. They were even rude during story hour. . .'Something will have to be done,' said Miss Nelson.  That something arrives the next schoolday, in the person of Miss Viola Swamp -- a witchy-faced, yet rosy-cheeked, tyrant in an ugly black dress. She cancels story hour, loads the class with homework, and warns, &quot;If you misbehave, you'll be sorry.&quot; <br /> The kids soon long for Miss Nelson. They worry about what happened to her and go to the police for help. They even go to Miss Nelson's house, only to spot Viola Swamp walking down Miss Nelson's street! <br /> When Miss Nelson finally returns, she's very evasive when the children ask about her absence, and happily &quot;surprised&quot; by their changed behavior. The former hooligans show Miss Nelson the utmost respect. Later that day, while getting ready for bed, she hangs her coat in the closet, right next to an ugly black dress.  <br /> James Marshall's illustrations perfectly capture the sweet, rosy-cheeked Miss Nelson, and the mean, but also rosy-cheeked, Viola Swamp.  He gives just enough clues for kids to guess the true identity of the substitute. In addition to the ugly black dress in the closet, there's also a wig and a false, pointy nose lying around Miss Nelson's room.	2000-06-13

Little Nutbrown Hare wants  to tell his father, Big Nutbrown Hare, just how much he loves him, but no  matter what measure Little Nutbrown Hare chooses, his father always loves  him more. For example, Little Nutbrown Hare loves his father as high as he  can hop, but Big Nutbrown Hare loves his son as high as he can hop, and he  can hop much higher. Finally, the tired little rabbit tells his father he  loves him right up to the moon. Big Nutbrown Hare kisses his son good night  and whispers, &quot;I love you right up to the moon-- and back.&quot;<br />  Anita Jeram's pen and ink and watercolor illustrations of father and  son gracefully capture the love they feel for each other. She hasn't drawn  the typical cute little bunnies found in many children's books; she's drawn  creatures capable of expressing emotion. The expression on Little Nutbrown  Hare's face as he's falling asleep is one I've seen on my own children. Her  pictures also show an incredible range of movement, from stretching arms as  high or as wide as possible to very gently kissing a sleeping child on the  forehead.<br />  This is one of my favorite books. It's a standard part  of any &quot;new baby&quot; gift I give, and everyone who has received it  from me tells me that they cried when they read it. I still cry.	2000-06-13

Just as Guess How Much I Love You is good for a tear or two, this book is guaranteed to bring out the giggles, at least as far as my kids are concerned. Its message, however, is very serious: parental love is  unconditional. The story takes place as a mother is tucking her son into  bed. &quot;I love you, my wonderful child,&quot; she says. But her son  asks, &quot;[W]hat if I were a big, scary ape?. . .what if I were a super  smelly skunk?. . .what if I were an alligator with big, sharp teeth that  could bite your head off. . .?&quot; Would she love him even then?           Not only would she still love him, she assures him, but she would treasure  the things that make him unique. If he were an ape, she'd comb his hair and  make him a banana birthday cake. If he were a skunk, she would cuddle him  and whisper, &quot;I love you, Stinky Face.&quot; If he were a meat-eating  dinosaur whose claws ripped the sheets every night, she'd feed him lots of  meat and mend his sheets every day. <br />        Cyd Moore's illustrations  are witty and wonderful! Each picture of the boy with his mother gives a  clue to what he's going to become next. On one page he's playing on his bed  with his covers draped around his shoulders; on the next page he's &quot;a  swamp creature with slimy, smelly seaweed hanging from [his] body.&quot; On  one page he's letting fireflies loose from a jar; on the next page he's a  Martian who eats bugs instead of peanut butter. No matter what type of  creature he changes into, the boy still wears his orange, green and yellow  striped pajamas. Because Ms. Moore uses the colors of the sky just as  sunset is turning to dusk -- pink, purple, blue, green -- this book is a  perfect bedtime tale.	2000-06-13

When it's  harvest time, the Farmer carefully picks the pumpkin, scoops out the slimy  pulp, carves a face, and places a light inside.<br />The story ends by telling  how God is the Farmer, and we are just like those pumpkins, chosen by Him,  made clean and given His light. For older readers, this similarity is  reinforced by appropriate Bible verses on the bottom of each page.<br />I use  this book every year just before Halloween in my third grade Sunday School  class. My students are just learning to use their Bibles, so I start by  having the kids look up some of the verses before we read the story. Those  verses that seemed dry and dusty before the story come alive when we read  about the Farmer. I also share this book with my own, younger kids, just  before we carve jack-o'-lanterns.

Sometimes you read a book and think, &quot;This was written just for me.&quot; That's how I felt when I read this one. I have four children who were born within six years of each other, and at times the sibling rivalry  can be quite intense. My kids ask, &quot;Who do you love the best?&quot;  The standard answer of &quot;I love you all exactly the same&quot; isn't  exactly true. I love them all immensely just because they are mine, but I  also love each of them differently because each one is unique.           Barbara M. Joosse conveys this in her story of a summer evening that a  mother and her two sons spend at a lakeside cabin. From the opening lines  about hunting for bait, she makes it obvious that these two boys have  distinct personalities: &quot;Max exploded from the cabin, twirling the  shovel in front of him. Mama came next, and then Julian. Julian shut the  cabin door tightly to keep it safe from burglars and bears.&quot;           Whenever the boys ask their mother who is the best, she gives them an  answer that allows them both to be special. Max catches the liveliest  worms, and Julian catches the juiciest; Julian is the rower with the  deepest strokes, and Max is the rower with the fastest. When each boy asks,  &quot;Mama, who do you love the best?&quot; She answers by giving them each  a color of love that matches his personality. Julian is the bluest. Max is  the reddest. Each boy is thrilled with her answer. <br />        Mary Whyte's  illustrations are a beautiful complement to the story. The pictures fill  each two page spread with the soft colors of a summer evening. The mother  and sons are strikingly real. I look at Max and Julian and see my own boys,  one overflowing with exuberant energy, the other cooler and more  reflective.	2000-06-13

Any loving parent, or child of a loving parent, will recognize the overwhelming love the mother in this story feels for her son. When her son  is a newborn, she rocks him and sings to him, &quot;I'll love you forever,  I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.&quot;  When he's asleep, she rocks him and sings him that song through each stage  of his childhood. When he's a grown man with his own home, she drives over  to his house with a ladder, makes sure he is fast asleep, climbs through  his bedroom window, then rocks him and sings to him (my husband thinks this  is a little strange, but I'm convinced that there are plenty of mothers out  there who would do the same if they thought they could get away with it).  <br />        The tears come when the mother gets sick, and can't finish the  song. Her son then holds her in his lap, rocks her, and sings to her. Then  he goes home, picks up his newborn daughter, and sings.           The  illustrations are a beautiful complement to the story. Not only does the  son grow up, but the mother slowly grows older. Her house keeps its  old-fashioned look, even down to the rotary phone on her bedside; his house  is more modern, with up-to-date kitchen appliances. The mother has a  striped cat that appears in several illustrations of the boy growing up. In  his house, there is a kitten, that grows into a cat, that turns into a  rather large, well-fed cat by the end of the story. <br />        Not only am  I sharing this book with my kids, but I gave my mom a copy for Mother's  Day.	2000-06-13

It's a dog that will sit on your bookshelf! It's a fun dog book that you and your kids will love!<br />This clever book, which comes complete with nylon leash,  wagging tail, and fuzzy endpapers, insists that it is a dog. He was a  normal puppy until he got lost in the enchanted woods. He finds a home with  kindly old witch (by witch standards she was nice, anyway), but when he  used her best broom as a chew toy, she turns him into a German  Shepherd.<br />That's right. A shepherd. On a mountain top in Germany. You  were thinking of the other kind, weren't you? That's part of the fun of  this book -- wonderful plays on words.<br />By the time the puppy finishes his  story, he's begging the reader to believe that he is, really and truly, a  dog. He may not be like other dogs, &quot;but at least I don't have fleas  and I never bite.&quot; And he'll never make puddles on your carpet if you  let him be a part of your family. If only all dogs were like that!<br />My  kids won't let me trade in our two real dogs for more like this one, but  they love spending time with this dog, er, book. My seven year old can read  it all by herself, and her almost five year old brother has memorized it so  he can &quot;read&quot; it, too.	2000-06-12

Clifford is so popular that's there's a Clifford book for every season and nearly every holiday. As if that weren't enough, there's also a whole line of Clifford's puppy day stories, which also cover every season and most major holidays.  This dog is huge -- in more ways than one!<br />The first book is very simple  and very sweet, and it goes a long way toward explaining the popularity of  the series. Instead of being a story about a big, red dog, it's a story  about the special friendship between a girl and her dog. Emily Elizabeth  loves her dog, despite what others may see as his shortcomings. yes, even  Emily Elizabeth will admit that he has a few. For instance, when Clifford  chases cars, he actually catches them and brings them home.<br />When Clifford  doesn't win first prize at the dog show, Emily Elizabeth doesn't mind.  She'll take Clifford over any of those other dogs any day. Reminds me of my  daughter's fierce loyalty to Blackie, our stray mutt with chronic mange.  Even when Blackie is going through one of her Mexican Hairless  impersonations, my daughter still thinks Blackie is the best dog in the  world.	2000-06-12

Her ma's picky about things like saying please and wearing shoes. Her little brother, Jack, is so perfect &quot;he ha[s] a little halo over his head.&quot; Her dog, Ol' Red, seems to have  things a lot easier. &quot;My dog never says 'please,'&quot; muses Ginnie  Mae, &quot;and no one thinks a thing about it.&quot;             Finally,  after a night of being told to mind her manners, eat like a lady, clean her  room, and put on her shoes, Ginnie Mae declares she'd rather be a dog.  Humored by her parents, she moves in with Ol' Red, to a life of treeing  cats, digging holes, sleeping in the doghouse, and begging for scraps.  &quot;Ol' Red's real good about sharing. . . I think he's even given me  some of his fleas.&quot; <br />          Kibbles can't compare to her ma's  cooking, however, and when it starts to rain, Ginnie Mae starts to  reconsider her care-free lifestyle. &quot;Pa says I can go back to being  myself anytime I've a mind to. So maybe I'll just saunter on in and wash up  for supper,&quot; she decides. <br />          This story has some great comic  moments that make my four-year-old laugh out loud, and even bring a smile  to his oh-so-sophisticated six-year-old sister's face. I like the fact that  even though the story is told through Ginnie Mae's voice, Ma and Pa are  presented as perfectly reasonable parents. More importantly, the author,  Suzanne Williams, lets the story play to it's logical outcome without  moralizing. She allows her readers to draw for themselves the conclusion  that good manners are a fair trade-off for the blessings of civilization.             Tedd Arnold's illustrations are priceless, adding wry humor to an  already amusing story. He gives us Ginnie Mae at the dinner table, the food  flying everywhere, and Ginnie Mae and Ol' Red sitting side by side on their  haunches, scratching at fleas. Funniest of all is the teeth-baring grin  Ginnie Mae gives her annoying little brother at the end of the book, and  his startled reaction to it.	2000-06-12

No, besides a bunch preschoolers overdue for a nap. Monsters, right? According to Bethany Roberts, even monsters have manners sometimes.            This  book, written in verse, shows monsters at their worst and at their best.  For example, &quot;They might be very messy, / and leave things where they  drop. / But they sometimes clean their rooms / and dust and scrub and  mop.&quot; Every activity the monsters do is something kids can relate to,  such as tearing up toys on bad manners days, and happily putting them away  and repairing the broken ones on good manners days.            Andrew  Glass's monsters are warm and fuzzy. No need to worry about nightmares from  this book. In fact, these monsters are an awful lot like little kids, who  may sometimes forget their manners, but sometimes they don't.	2000-06-12

Unlike some other series, the Arthur books don't bang you over the head with the moral of the story. It's there,  but woven so subtly into the story that you discover it on your own.<br />When  I first saw Arthur in his present incarnation, I thought he was some sort  of a mouse. He's actually an aardvark. He looks more like an aardvark in  the earliest book. That's the problem: Arthur doesn't like his long  aardvark snout.<br />His family loves Arthur and his nose. But the kids at  school, who are all different types of animals, sometimes make fun of his  nose, so Arthur decides to change it. He visits a rhinologist (who is a  rhino, of course), and tries out different pictures of noses. Would he be  happier with a rabbit's nose? A chicken's? An armadillo's?<br />Finally, he  decides to stick with the nose he's got.<br />It's a great message for any kid  who feels a little different. But, look at Arthur today. What happened to  that long snout? No matter, he's still my favorite. As author Marc Brown  put it in the first book, &quot;There's more to Arthur than his nose.&quot;	2000-06-12

My kids may not listen to me nagging them to clean up their rooms, but they will listen to Mama Bear. Since there's a  Berenstain Bear book that covers just about any problem that crops up in  our house, we know Mama, Papa, Brother and Sister Bear almost as well as we  know our next door neighbors (and they're related to us!).<br />If you only  know the Bear family though some of their more recent books, you might be  surprised to learn that the first few Berenstain Bears books aren't about  problem-solving at all. Instead, they are rhyming books about life in what  later came to be know as &quot;the tree house down a sunny dirt road in  Bear Country.&quot;<br />In the very first book, an empty honey pot sends Papa  Bear and Small Bear (later to be known as Brother Bear) on a quest for some  honey. Mama tells them to get it at the honey store, conveniently located  just outside the front door. Papa Bear, however, has grander plans.  <br />&quot;Not at the store.  Oh, no, Small Bear.  If a bear is smart,  If a  bear knows how,  He goes on a honey hunt.  Watch me now!&quot;  If you've  read any of the Bears' adventures, you'll know that of course Papa's grand  plans backfire. He and Small Bear end up hiding in a pond to escape a swarm  of angry bees. On the last page, Mama watches with a knowing smile as Papa  buys honey from the store.<br />There's one person in my family who cringes  every time a new Bear book shows up on the night's list of requested  reading. My husband doesn't like to see Papa always portrayed as a buffoon.  Sometimes, just to make my husband feel better, I'll let Papa be the  sensible one and Mama be the comic relief.	2000-06-12

This is the perfect book for a kid whose favorite jokes revolve around the words &quot;toilet&quot; and &quot;underwear&quot; -- your typical four year old, for instance. My typical four year old loves it! The Dumb Bunnies  are a family of clueless rabbits who might remind you of a certain family  of bears. When they go to town to let their porridge cool off, they take  their bikes, which are strapped on top of their car.          &quot;'Can I  drive the car?&quot; asked Baby Bunny.          &quot;'You don't know how  to drive,&quot; said Poppa Bunny. 'You'd get us all killed.'           &quot;'Aw, please?' asked Baby Bunny.          &quot;'Duh, okay,' said  Poppa Bunny.&quot;          While the Dumb Bunnies are in town bowling at  the library and picnicking in the car wash, Little Red Goldilocks, whose  skin is white as snow, breaks into their house. She sleeps in Poppa Bunny's  porridge, eats Momma Bunny's bed, and uses Baby Bunny's pimple cream, but  the Dumb Bunnies love her. In fact, Baby Bunny loves her so much, that he  flushes her down the toilet.           This book was my first introduction  to Dav Pilkey, and now I'm a diehard fan. His cartoon drawings are  hilarious! The cover of The Dumb Bunnies shows the family in the great  green room from &quot;Good Night Moon,&quot; complete with the bowl of mush  on a table and lava lamps on the mantle. There's even a big gold  Caldecott-like seal over the illustration which reads &quot;This book is  too dumb to win an award.&quot; Well, if four year olds could give book  awards, this one would be a sure winner!	2000-06-12

If you like puns and sight gags, then you'll love Dav Pilkey's Dog Breath, subtitled The Horrible Trouble with Hally Tosis. This crime-fighting canine story is one pun after another. Those adults who don't appreciate a good  (or a really bad) pun may groan, but kids will eat it up and ask for  seconds.<br />Hally, the resident dog in the Tosis household, has breath so  bad that when she opens her mouth, the leaves on the houseplants wither and  die, the wallpaper curls up, and the picture of Mona Lisa holds her nose.  Her breath is so bad that Mr. and Mrs. Tosis tell the kids the dog must go.  The kids try everything to fix Hally's aroma -- the breath-taking view  doesn't work, neither does the movie that promises to &quot;take your  breath away.&quot;<br />That night, two burglars, whose arrival has been  heralded all through the illustrations, break into the Tosis house. The  only thing that stops them from making off with all the family's stuff is,  what else, a big, wet, sloppy, stinky slurp from Hally. Mr. and Mrs. Tosis  can't kick a hero out of the house. Because, after all, life without  Hally... no, I'm not going to spoil one of the best puns in the book for  you; you'll just have to read it yourself	2000-06-12

A hungry snake finds tennapping mice and drops them one by one into a jar for safekeeping. &quot;First I will count them and then I will eat them up,&quot; said the snake. &quot;Mouse Count! One... two... three...&quot; <br /> The mice wake up and convince the snake that he needs one more mouse, a very large one that they point out to him. While the snake goes to capture the other mouse (which is really a large gray rock), the mice tip the jar over. &quot;Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.&quot; The mice uncounted themselves and ran home. <br /> The text is easy enough for a beginning reader, and the uncluttered illustrations make counting easy for beginners, too.	2000-06-12

He's a relative newcomer to the world of children's literature, but with his (prince) charming personality and zest for life, I expect he'll star in a few more books.<br />In his first appearance, Froggy awakens from his winter  hibernation to the joy of small children everywhere -- SNOW! He hops out of  bed and dresses for action, with plenty of fun to hear sound effects (zip!  zup!). First his mom tells him to go back to sleep. Then, realizing that  that's a losing battle, she does her best to make sure he dresses warmly.  This entails reminding Froggy of articles of clothing he forgot to put on,  so Froggy gets dressed and undressed a few times. After Froggy finally  makes it outside, Mom reminds him of one important item he forgot --  UNDERWEAR! The magic word -- it makes Froggy blush and gives his friends,  and his readers, the giggles.<br />Froggy finally gets so tired of dressing  and undressing that he goes back to sleep. Maybe his mom knew that would  happen all along.	2000-06-12

He looks like the &quot;before&quot; picture in an ad for a mail order body-building course, while his big and hairy older brothers look like the  &quot;after&quot; picture. The older brothers party all night at the Palace  Disco with their princess girlfriends, while Prince Cinders cleans up their  beer cans, cigarette butts, and macho magazines. <br />        One night,  while Prince Cinders is doing a load of dirty socks, a fairy drops down the  chimney. She tries to make all his wishes come true. She changes a crumpled  beer can into a red sports car, a toy red sports car, that is. &quot;That  can't be right,&quot; the fairy muses. She gives him a new suit to wear to  the Palace Disco -- a swim suit. Finally, she makes him big and hairy, like  his brothers, sort of. Now he's a big hairy ape wearing a swimsuit! <br />         The fairy is pretty sure the spell will wear off by midnight. In the  meantime, Prince Cinders admires himself in the mirror -- he sees a dashing  prince in an Armani suit -- and hops on (not in) the little red sports car  to check out the Palace Disco. He's so big that he can't fit in the door.  He wisely decides to take the bus home, and bumps into pretty Princess  Lovelypenny. &quot;Luckily, midnight struck and Prince Cinders changed back  into himself. The princess thought he had saved her by frightening away the  big hairy monkey. 'Wait!' she shouted, but Prince Cinders was too shy. He  even lost his trousers in the rush!&quot; <br />        Soon all the princes  in the land are standing around in their underwear, waiting for the chance  to try on the trousers. Of course, these trousers only fit a scrawny guy  like Prince Cinders. He tries them on; they fit, and Prince Cinders and  Princess Lovelypenny are wed. The princess tells the fairy about the way  Prince Cinders' older brothers used to treat him, and suddenly they are  turned into house fairies, in charge ofkeeping the palace spic and span  forever. <br />        My four year old son loves this story, especially the  illustration of Prince Cinders as the big hairy ape, peering through the  window at the royalty dancing at the Palace Disco. My six year old daughter  likes Princess Lovelypenny's leopard print outfit. Both my kids think being  doomed to clean the palace forever is a fate worse than death, and from the  expressions on the faces of the house fairies, Prince Cinders's brothers  would probably agree.	2000-06-12

Not only is she a princess, but she's got everything that goes with being a princess -- a castle, good looks, a great wardrobe, and Prince Ronald for a fiance. Then along comes a dragon who smashes her castle, incinerates her clothes, kidnaps her boyfriend, and  musses her hair.<br />          An ordinary princess would dissolve into  heartbroken sobs at this point, but Elizabeth is anything but ordinary. For  modesty's sake, she grabs the only covering available, a paper bag, and  sets out to find the dragon and rescue Ronald. The dragon tells her to go  away -- he's too full to eat a princess at the moment. Not to be put off,  Elizabeth tricks the dragon into proving just how mighty he is, and  exhausting himself in the process. When the dragon is soundly asleep,  Elizabeth opens the door to the dragon's lair and finds Ronald. <br />         Ronald, who, for want of a better word, is a royal jerk, doesn't even say  &quot;thank you.&quot; Instead, he shakes his finger at Elizabeth and  scolds, &quot;Elizabeth, you are a mess! Your hair is all tangled and you  are wearing a dirty old paper bag. Come back tomorrow when you are dressed  like a real princess.&quot;          As you might guess, Elizabeth tells  him off and goes skipping into the sunset. Even my four year old, usually  the champion of any prince in any tale, cheers for Elizabeth at the end. As  for his sister, well, Ronald just confirms her theory that no boy is as  good as her dad (except for maybe one certain boy in her class, but that's  another story altogether).	2000-06-12

She  shows him a pot, a broom, and egg, naming each item. Bang. Bang. Bang.  Bang. He's still not catching on and now there's raw egg all over the  floor.<br />Exasperated, Ruby helps Max into his high chair and shows him an  apple, &quot;Say APPLE, Max. YUM YUM, Max. Say YUM YUM.&quot;<br />Max takes a  bite of the apple, then holds it aloft and repeats the new word he's  learned. &quot;DELICIOUS!&quot;<br />The Max board books are great for babies  and toddlers.

Just ask the title character of Susan Meddaugh's clever story, Cinderella's Rat. You may remember him from the fairy tale: he's the one that the Fairy Godmother turned into a coachman (actually more of a coachboy). While Cinderella is busy dancing at the  ball, Cinderella's Rat and his sister, Ruth (who is still a rat), have an  adventure of their own. They discover rat heaven -- a fully stocked castle  larder. Before they can enjoy it, however, there's a case of mistaken  identity, and a well-meaning new friend drags the boy and Ruth to a wizard  so the wizard can turn Ruth &quot;back&quot; into a girl. The boy is afraid  to reveal the truth. What if the wizard turns both him and Ruth into cat  food? <br />        Since Ruth is truly a rat, the wizard can't completely  change her from a rat to a girl. Much to her brother's dismay, the wizard  transforms Ruth into a cat, then a girl who meows, then a girl who woofs.  Before the wizard can &quot;fix&quot; his last spell, it's nearly midnight,  and, well, you know what happens when the clock strikes twelve. The  coachboy returns to his rat self, and Ruth helps her family by keeping the  cats away.           The most amazing thing about Ms. Meddaugh's  illustrations is that when Cinderella's Rat and his sister change from rat  to human or vice versa, they are still recognizably their former selves. As  humans, they look slightly rodent-like, but in a cute way. As rats, they  seem almost human, especially when the siblings are sniffing the cheese  that leads them into a trap, or huddled inside the trap awaiting their  fate.	2000-06-12

At the Wicked Witch's cottage, he peruses the newspaper, the  Mirror Mirror, while the witch reads her mail and her black cat does the  dishes. At Cinderella's castle, he enjoys a glass of champagne poured by  Prince Charming, who is still in his honeymoon Hawaiian print shirt and  white slacks.

Only two things keep him from ripping his neighbors to shreds -- his  chain, which only reaches so far, and his owner, who always screams,  &quot;BAD DOG, BOB! BAD DOG! &quot;<br />Then someone else moves into the  neighborhood. This animal can talk, too, but Martha soon realizes her new  neighbor is only parroting her words back to her. She teaches the bird to  say &quot;Good dog! What a dog!&quot; and &quot;You must have  fleas!&quot;<br />When Martha decides one day to tell Bad Dog Bob what she  really thinks of him, she's not counting on his chain being broken. Just  when Martha is sure Bob is going to have her for a doggie treat, a voice  from above says, &quot;Good dog!&quot; Suddenly, Bob smiles. Quick-thinking  Martha teaches her parrot friend more words of praise, and Bad Dog Bob  turns into Tail-wagging Bob.<br />My kids love the Martha books because they  are so funny. I love them because they are great jumping off places for  discussions of serious topics. This book led to a discussion of just what  it means to call someone &quot;Stupid Head.&quot; I can't say we've totally  eliminated that insult or others like it from our house, but we're working  on it.	2000-06-12

In this  version of Rumpelstiltskin, the miller's daughter, Meredith, is not a  brainless wench who jumps at the chance to marry the king. Rumpelstiltskin  is not an evil child-snatching gnome. In fact, he's a sweet soul who only  wants one thing in life -- a child to love and care for. No wonder Meredith  decides to ditch the king and marry Rumpelstiltskin. Besides, she has a  weakness for short men.           Rumpelstiltskin and Meredith marry, work  on their farm, and raise their daughter. Although the family could use  Rumpelstiltskin's talents to become exceedingly rich, he only spins a small  amount of gold to buy those things they can't make or grow themselves. The  rest of the people in the kingdom are not so lucky. The greedy king has  rooms full of gold while his subjects are penniless and starving. No wonder  he needs a contingent of armed guards who have elevated teeth-gnashing and  sword-clutching into an art form. <br />        When Rumpelstiltskin's  daughter is sixteen, her parents let her take the odd bit of gold into town  to exchange it for coins to buy necessities. Eventually the old greedy king  hears about this, kidnaps Rumpelstiltskin's daughter, and locks her in a  tower filled with straw.          &quot;Rumpelstiltskin's daughter looked  around. She saw a pile of straw the size of a bus. She saw a locked door  and high windows. She gave a big sigh and began to think. She knew her  father could get her out of this pickle. But she had heard stories about  the king all her life. One room full of gold would never satisfy him. Her  father would be stuck here, spinning, until there was not an iota of straw  left in the kingdom.          &quot;After a while she climbed the pile of  straw and thought some more. She thought about the poor farmers and about  the hungry children with their thin faces and sad eyes. She put the two  thoughts together and cooked up a plan. . .&quot;           Instead of  spinning straw into gold, Rumpelstiltskin's daughter puts her plan (which  Ms. Stanley develops so cleverly that you really should read it for  yourself) into action and saves the kingdom by teaching the king some  simple lessons in economics and public relations. By the end of the story,  the king offers her his hand in marriage, which she wisely declines.  &quot;Why don't you make me prime minister, instead,&quot; she suggests.  <br />        The best word to describe the illustrations is sumptuous. Diane  Stanley's greedy king with his elegantly styled coif bears a striking  resemblance to Louis XIV, and the artwork mirrors the Sun King's opulence.  The palace shines with gilded ceilings and elaborate tiled floors. On the  palace walls hang masterpieces so famous that my six year old can recognize  most of them --works by da Vinci, Van Gogh, Picasso.	2000-06-12

If, like me, you're ready to tear your lips off if you have to read the traditional story of &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot; one more time, then you need to  go into a quiet room, settle in a comfy chair, and read this book. Don't  forget to lock the door, or the rest of the family will want to come in to  see what you're laughing about. <br />        As the introduction states,  &quot;[t]he stories in this book are Fairly Stupid Tales.&quot; They've got  names like Cinderumpelstiltskin, the Really Ugly Ducking, and Chicken  Licken. Then there's The Stinky Cheese Man, about the child fashioned out  of stinky cheese by a lonely old woman and her husband. &quot;When she  opened the oven to see if he was done, the smell knocked her back. 'Phew!  What is that terrible smell?' she cried. The Stinky Cheese Man hopped out  of the oven and ran out the door calling, 'Run run run as fast as you can.  You can't catch me, I'm the Stinky Cheese Man!'          The little old  lady and the little old man sniffed the air. 'I'm not really very hungry,'  said the little old man. 'I'm not really all that lonely,' said the little  old lady.&quot;  <br />To fully appreciate how funny this book is, you need to  hold it in your hands and check out the illustrations. They are funny in  and of themselves, and the way the book is put together is nothing short of  brilliant. This is the perfect book for the sophisticated reader of  whatever age.	2000-06-12

You probably know someone like Officer Buckle. He knows more about safety than anyone else in Napville, and he's more than willing to share his expertise. If only someone would listen. Instead, when Officer Buckle  delivers his litany of safety tips at Napville schools, some of the kids  fly paper airplanes in the auditorium. Some of the kids fall asleep. Nobody  pays attention. Worst of all, they do the exact things he warned them  against.<br />That all changes when Gloria, the new police dog, joins Officer  Buckle for one of his safety lectures. As far as Officer Buckle knows,  Gloria just sits next to him on stage and smiles. But the moment his back  is turned, she's acting out each of his safety tips -- such as &quot;NEVER  leave a THUMBTACK where you might SIT on it!&quot; Not only are the kids  paying attention, they're laughing, cheering, and -- best of all -- putting  into practice what they learn in the lecture! Suddenly every school in town  wants a safety lecture.<br />Everything goes well until Officer Buckle catches  a story about their lectures on the 10 o'clock news. There he is on TV,  pronouncing safety tip ninety nine (&quot;Don't go swimming during an  electrical storm&quot;) with as much emphasis as he can muster, and there's  Gloria, stealing the show. Not only does that incident lead to safety tip  one hundred (&quot;Never turn your back on a strange dog&quot;), but it  signals the end of Officer Buckle's association with Gloria.<br />Gloria does  the next safety lecture on her own, and it's so boring even she falls  asleep. Afterwards, the school has it's worst accident ever. Officer Buckle  and Gloria realize they need each other to get their safety message across.  As Officer Buckle says in safety tip one hundred and one, &quot;Always work  with a buddy.&quot;<br />The sight gags in Peggy Rathmann's illustrations  helped earn this book a Caldecott Medal. They also contain a lot of  practical safety information, which makes this book a great place to start  for a discussion on safety, as well as for a discussion on teamwork and  partnershipplace to start  for a discussion on safety, as well as for a discussion on teamwork and  partnership	2000-06-12

Not only are the pages sturdy enough for little hands, but they have round holes just perfect for little fingers to poke through. Starting with one green frog, each page features a number  in big, black type, and a corresponding illustration. One eye of each  illustration is cut out, making a continuous hole all the way through the  book.        This book makes learning to count as easy as 1, 2, 3. The  bright, crisp illustrations are set on a white background. Those  illustrating larger numbers are neatly lined up, so your child can  concentrate on counting without having to search for that tenth bumble bee.	2000-06-12

It's an education seeing Madeline through her eyes. In Madeline, my daughter, who is somewhat shy and leery of new  experiences, has a heroine who is smart, spunky, and completely in control  of every situation. <br />I like Madeline the character a lot more than I like  the books. I've found that very few writers can write wonderful verse, and  I don't include Bemelmans in that august company. Some of his rhymes flow  nicely together, such as the opening lines of the first book:<br />In an old  house in Paris  that was covered with vines  lived twelve little girls in  two straight lines.  Some of his rhymes are jarring:<br />and soon after Dr.  Cohn   came, he rushed out to the phone,   and he dialed : DANton-ten-six  -- <br />'Nurse,' he said, 'it's an appendix!'   Everybody had to cry --  <br />not a single eye was dry.  . . .  Madeline woke up two hours <br />later,  in a room with flowers. <br />Still, the story isn't bad. A brave little girl  is rushed to the hospital, has her appendix out, then shows off her scar.  She makes it so exciting that all the other girls want their appendix out,  too. Even my daughter wanted to have an appendix scar, until I explained  just what that would entail.	2000-06-11

This Silly Old Bear is one of the most-beloved characters in children's literature. Many readers are familiar with the updated Disney version of Pooh.  I like that Pooh (my kids LOVE him), but I'm a bigger fan of the original Pooh, now over sixty years old and still as silly and lovable as  ever. If you haven't read the original tales, you're in for a  treat!<br />Unlike the modern Disney tales, the original Pooh stories aren't  vehicles for teaching lessons or imparting values. Instead, the original  stories about the adventures of the Bear of Very Little Brain and his  friends in the Hundred Acre Wood are simply delightful tales about  well-meaning, though slightly addle-brained characters. Half the fun of the  original Pooh stories is knowing more than the characters, and laughing at  the silly situations they create for themselves. The other half of the fun  is listening to the wonderful wordplay A.A. Milne uses to tell the tales.  <br />The first chapter, in which Pooh tries to use a balloon to float up to a  honey comb and help himself to some honey, introduces Pooh's unique thought  processes. He explains his plan to Christopher Robin,<br />&quot;When you go  after honey with a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees know  you're coming. Now, if you have a green balloon, they might think you were  only part of the tree, and not notice you, and if you have a blue balloon,  they might think you were only a part of the sky, and not notice you, and  the question is: Which is most likely?&quot; <br />When Christopher Robin asks  if the bees might be suspicious of the bear floating beneath the balloon,  Pooh says, &quot;They might or they might not. . . You can never tell with  bees. . .I shall try to look like a small black cloud. That will deceive  them.&quot; This is classic Pooh!<br />One note for Tigger fans: Tigger  doesn't bounce into the Hundred Acre Wood until the second book, The House  at Pooh Corner.	2000-06-11

Not only do you get to live in the palace in Celesteville, but you also get to rewrite your life story. In the original books, Babar was an ordinary elephant who was orphaned at a young  age and went to seek his fortune in the city before he returned and was  chosen to be king. In the newer video series that my kids brought home from  the library the other day, Babar recounts his adventures as a young prince  growing up in the palace. And they say elephants never forget!<br />The  original story is fairly simple. After a hunter kills his mother, Babar  runs away until he comes to a city. As luck would have it, one of the first  people he meets is a lady who loves to spend money on young elephants. Soon  Babar has a dashing new wardrobe, a private tutor, and elegant friends.  Life would be wonderful if he weren't so homesick. When his two cousins  show up, Babar decides to go back home with them. The elders of the  elephant herd decide that Babar, with his civilized ways, should become  their king. <br />There's a school of thought that criticizes the Babar  stories as colonialist. But then, most of children's literature written  before the 1970s isn't exactly politically correct, is it? Do you tell your  children that Babar is a tool of the imperialist establishment, or do you  point out what a wonderful culture the elephants built when they banded  together to build Celesteville, their capital city? Or do you just read the  stories for pure enjoyment?	2000-06-11

George always finds something intriguing to do, or look at or pick up, and it always leads to trouble. Luckily for him, people have a soft  spot for curious little monkeys, so he never gets in too much trouble, at  least not for very long.<br />In the first book, George's inquiring mind is  responsible for his capture in Africa, and his trouble while staying with  the man in the yellow hat. George watches the man pick up the phone, dial a  few numbers, and talk to someone on the other end. Naturally, as soon as  the man leaves George alone (big mistake), George decides to go dialing on  his own. He calls the fire department, and they send over an engine and a  squad of firefighters. They are none too pleased to discover it's a false  alarm, and drag George off to jail. He escapes and has a few more  adventures before the man with the yellow hat catches up with him. Then  it's off to the zoo for George, until the next book anyway.<br />I'm convinced  my three-year-old kid with the yellow hair is George's soulmate. He's  dialed the fire department , too (although he had the benefit of speed  dial), and we can't turn our back on him for a second or he gets into all  kinds of trouble. No wonder George is one of his favorites!	2000-06-11
