His study of the Greek and his familiarity with the Greek text led him to change his mind eventually.  He came to believe that the innocent  party to a divorce could remarry.  He sites scripture to prove his point. This is more than a study of the separation which divorce brings.  It reaches out to discuss how to treat those who are divorced.  Frequently  they  appear to be second class citizens in the congregation of the faithful.  The study is illuminated with the authors pastoral concern for all who are involved. How are fellow church members to treat divorcees?<BR>Fourteen brief chapters are included in this study beginning with a statement of purpose. Christs divorce law in Matthew 5:32 is discussed in the second chapter. The discussion continues with a study of the Jewish writing on divorcement.  Does Put Away mean Dissolution? Chapters five and six discuss fornication. Chapter seven discusses Christs divorce law as seen in Matthew 19:9. Chapters 8 and 9 look at the meaning of fornication. The meanings of Romans 7:1-4 is taken up in chapter 10.  I Corinthians 7: 10-15  is the theme of chapter 11.   Chapter 12 gives the views of the church fathers on marriage and divorce.  Chapter 13 discusses replies to objections and chapter 14 provides a summary of the evidence.  A good bibliography of older books relating to the subject is also provided.  <br />While this study was written some years go, it deserves attention as more and more churches are faced with divorces in their congregations. Both laymen and pastors will find the study enlightening and helpful	2003-06-05

Reisinger: A Biography	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An Outstanding Christian	This is a fascinating book about an outstanding Christian whose work covered the second half of the 20th century. The author, Geoffrey Thomas, has been  his friend since they met at Westminister Theological Seminary in Philadelphia in 1963. For a period in his life Ernie Reisinger wandered far from the faith and abused alcohol. When he returned to his faith in Christ and loyalty to the church, Reisinger joined the Southern Baptist Church although he was reared in the Presbyterian Church. He is credited with doing much to bring that group back to a more conservative stance. Reisinger was a keen business man who did not seek ordination until later in his life. His gifts as a speaker made him a widely recognized preacher.  <BR>Early in his life Reisinger realized the importance of books in the spreading of the gospel.  He sold and gave away an untold number of books, often assisting struggling students by providing the volumes they needed.  His work with the Banner of Truth Trust led to their United States headquarters being located in his home town, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Readers may be familiar with books Ernie wrote such as Whatever Happened to the Ten Commandments?  He was also the author of numerous pamphlets.<BR>Because of the cold climate in Pennsylvania, the Reisingers moved to Cape Coral, Florida where they reached out again to troubled churches. They are now retired. Their son Donald arranges his work with book distribution so that he can assist in their care.<BR>The life story of Ernie and Mima Reisinger is  challenging and encouraging.  The hardships of the family and the use made of failures as well as opportunities demonstrate what God can do through those who truly believe the gospel and practice what they believe.<BR>Geoffrey Thomas is the minister of Alfred Place Baptist Church, Aberystwyth, Wales. He is an associate editor of the Banner of Truth magazine.	2003-06-05

Life today is far more stress filled for everyone than it was  in the past. That adds to the pressure ministers face.  One of the problems is that every minister is an individual and every congregation is different.  The book goes in to many of the challenges which are presented to ministers and their wives.  The increased opportunities for women make the life of the minister's wife today different from what it has been in the past.  It seems clear that the minister who is happy in his work is one who has a well-grounded faith and a thorough knowledge of the Bible. He and his wife are building their marriage on the same foundation of faith and knowledge of the Bible.  They need to observe the basics of good family living.  A great asset is understanding friends who encourage and support.<BR> This is not a book to be read at a sitting.  It is a  resource to consult and a stimulation for discussion.	2003-06-05

The book was written because of the author's desire to see churches be strong enough to win the battles against Satan as they are  growing.   Three main ideas are raised.  The first  is that too little consideration is being given to the  theological foundation.   Without a well-grounded foundation the church that develops will be weak at best.  A second concern  is that  prayer is often neglected in the wealth of strategies and methods.  Spiritual realities can so easily be overlooked in the effort to \\"get something done,\\"  to increase the number of names on the church roll or the size of the budget. The third idea is that all too often discipleship is only a part of the purpose of the church.  It becomes another program, not a life style.<BR>There are 10 chapters in the book. Chapter 1 presents the foundation for a biblical model for a local congregation. Chapter 2 shows that discipleship is an over all goal to defeat the enemy through a disciplined lifestyle.  Power-driven programs are not the answer.      Chapters 3 through 8 concentrate on the six purposes of the local congregation. They provide much direction, the \\"how-to\\" for  achieving the goals of growing Christians in growing churches.   Chapter nine is titled  \\"Leading in Charge Without Losing the Battle.\\"  This involves sincere prayer by those who are leading.      And encouraging others to pray regularly. \\"Lead from your knees if you want to grow a church with discipled warriors.\\"  Chapter 10, \\"A Concluding Challenge,\\" gives serious warning through stories of failure in spiritual warfare from the Bible. The call is first to holiness and then to the battle.	2003-05-15

Memories of that awful period in human history are fading fast as those who experienced it  are dying.  This page in human history should not be forgotten.  The book is especially timely in the light of the war in Iraq.  This is not a story of battles but of the day-to-day life of a Christian family  during the time when Hitler and his minions ruled Germany.  The Ziefle family held fast to their Christian faith in the face of  danger and ridicule.  The book recounts their  walk of faith  day by day.  They suffered both physically and emotionally, especially during the five years Reinhold, the eldest son, was  a prisoner of war despised for being part of Hitler's army. It is a reminder of how to live one's faith in the midst of opposition and threats.  Sharing this family's experience is helpful in thinking about what is going on and will go on in Iraq as the people there learn to live with the effects of war. <BR>Georg and Maria Ziefle had four children, Reinhold. Kurt, Ruth, and Helmut.<BR>Both Reinhold and Kurt served in the German army.  Ruth under  took many daring adventures to care for the family and its needs.  Georg was not forced into the army because of his work for the Red Cross and the fact that he was disabled from World War I. Maria and she narrowly escaped being forced into service of the German war machine. Their faith was tested many times but they all survived the war and lived productive lives after the war.

This book was written  soon  after the events of September 11, 2001. Throughout the book the author raises serious questions.  Where was God when 9/11 happened?  He was at Ground Zero.  Chapter three discusses Holy Wars -  Muslim and Christian. Writes the author on page 48:  One of the great mysteries of the human condition -and a great proof of our twisted,  sinful condition - is that legalistic religions tend to be more popular than religions of grace.  People prefer the Law to the Gospel, even though the former plagues them with guilt, frustration, and moral failure.<br />The author continues: On the deepest level, Islam and Christianity are opposites.  One is a religion of sheer Law. To be sure, it can be morally impressive. But it can also be intensified into a stifling, oppressive legalism, whether politically or spiritually, grounded in the fear of transgression, making it, literally, a religion of terror.  The other is essentially a religion of sheer Gospel.  Christianity affirms the Law, too, but always in conjunction with Gods grace, which internalizes the Law and makes it an expression of freedom.<br /> A serious discussion of secularism  and terrorism is presented in chapter 5. The author writes: The battle for Western civilization currently underway is indeed not a battle against Islamic radicalism. To save the west from the enemies who would destroy it will take an intellectual battle against some of its own ideas. (p77). In this chapter the author explains areas of difference and explains their origin.  Chapter 6 discusses Christian citizenship. Chapter 7 is titled Wars and Rumors of Wars.  The book closes with chapter 8 The New Cultural Climate.  It closes with : Some today think that all religions of he world are the same; that is to say, equally good.  Others agree  that they are the same but conclude that they are equally bad. Perhaps Christians, who believe in the Gospel, should agree with the secularists: The worlds religions are all wrong, insofar as they result in self-righteousness, self-digitization, and a seared conscience that justifies wickedness in the name of its false gods, The Gospel, in contrast, puts its trust in Gods action , not our own, trading sin for forgiveness, hate for love, and glory for the cross.

The first five chapters begin \\"I Didn't Sign Up For . . . \\" and the last \\"I Signed Up For . . .\\"  As the author deals with her own set of experiences, it is easy to accept the suggestions that slip out which may help the reader in her own life. This is a book any woman can understand and one she can discuss with her friends.  The author points out that God often takes the things for which you did no sign up and uses them for his own glory.	2003-04-09

The book is written out of many years of experience seeking to learn what the Bible has to say about preaching.  He quotes Jesus as telling the disciples that they need not feel concern for what they are to say because it will be given them at the time they need it. No such inspiration has been promised to later preachers.  The Holy Spirit has four concerns for preaching: First, the content; next using the right language for the message; third, wisdom to make the practical application of the truth to life, and fourth,  timeliness of the message. Dr. Adams addresses each of these concerns and  ties everything together.<BR>These four elements should  blend so that none of them predominates. Throughout the book he stresses the importance of serious preparation for the high calling of speaking God's message to His people.  The goal is to achieve \\"the proper fit between the right message, in the right language, presented in the right manner, at the right time.\\"	2002-02-14
