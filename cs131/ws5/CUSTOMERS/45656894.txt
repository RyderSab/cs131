Go To Peru, adopt a couple of Peruvian orphans, superficially read a couple of tomes on Andean geography and 'shamanism', perhaps even take a tour or two..  and:  lo!  'The Secrets of the Ancient Incas\\" is born.  I give Langevin three stars for pure chutzpah. Needless to say, this book is not about 'ancient Incas', it is all about Langevin (what a great guy he is...etc..heh heh)  and perhaps you will find buried in between the all too mundane travelogue a few New Age practices that fit quite well within the Magical Blend but have little to do with the Inka.<br /><br />At least he is sincere and does not make things up, which is an achievement in itself if one considers the feeding frenzy that plagues popular  Andean shamanism these days. If you want more substance, I'd go for Williams, Villoldo, or even Wilcox	2005-10-09

I am of two minds about this book - there can be no doubt about the sincerity of Keeney's experiences, the depth of his insights, or the beauty and magic of the life that he has chosen for himself and that he describes in SOtS. I will leave these to be pointed out by other reviewers. However, beyond the most mundane clich&eacute;s, I see very little connection between Keeney's experiences and psychotherapy as we know it or ecology.<br /><br />In this book Keeney describes his journeys around the world.  Perhaps my greatest reservation with this book is that the man is like a butterfly - he constantly flits from one shaman to the next, never learning a tradition or a ceremony, never learning anything, really. His shamanic practice basically consists of a mediumship, where his body/mind is taken over by assorted \\"spirits\\", accompanied with shaking, speaking in tongues and total loss of conscious control. This, as one can imagine, can lead to humorous situation in a Native American sweat lodge, one of which Keeney was unceremoniously expelled following his antics, but is received with great affection and respect in different African traditions, including those of the Zulu, Bushmen and African-Americans. The descriptions of his meetings with Bushmen were particularly poignant and beautiful. The downside of mediumship is, I suppose, that one never really learns a technology of working with the alternate reality (whatever it is), or with energy.  Moreover, this has nothing to do with psychotherapy, which strives for conscious control (rather, letting go) and understanding of subconscious complexes and contractions. The psychotherapeutic theory in the book is, at best, rather simplistic; K is simply not interested in it. Given his experiences, I can see why.<br /><br />Although Keeney is very good at playing the humility game, he can't help mentioning throughout the book how assorted indigenous people called him \\"a very holy man, indeed\\".  Heh... yeah! There are many photographs in the book of the medicine people he met and perhaps 70% include the humble holy man Keeney himself.<br /><br />These comments notwithstanding, here is a man with the guts to meet all kinds of interesting people and to talk about his innermost sacred experiences to the whole world. This in itself, I believe, something worthy of respect.ok how assorted indigenous people called him \\"a very holy man, indeed\\".  Heh... yeah!

I  assumed that \\"Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice\\"  was going to tell us about apprenticeship, by a Westerner, to a rain forest shaman.  Well I suppose this was a bit naive of me - rather, this book describes a foray, by a sponsored \\"ethnobotanist\\"  (which is a code word for scientists typically sponsored by pharmaceutical industry, who case the globe for pharmacologically active substances; they've had many success stories, such as the yew tree used to treat ovarian cancer) who went to the Amazon to engage indigenous shamans and learn from them the recipes that could be used in the West following extraction of biologically active ingredients.  The \\"apprenticeship\\" seems to be a form of double-speak designed to attract buyers.  I don't like that.<br /><br />I don't want to engage in the debate of whether and under what circumstances such behaviour is ethical or not.  It is my understanding, however, that in most cases the shaman \\"recipes\\" are inextricably linked to his \\"power\\" and the cosmology of the specific tribe he belongs to.  Thus they may be, or they may be not, utterly ineffective in other hands.<br /><br />As Plotkin \\"searches for new medicines in the rain forest\\"  he indeed plonks into some humorous situations.  Whether these can be seen as a hero's journey well that is for the reader to decide for herself. In my case, I expected a book about Amazon spirituality. Unfortunately there are no - seriously, nada - insights about shamanism or entheogenic plants. What I got was glamorizing of a bioprospector story working for the pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />I do think this book fits well within a wider discourse of bioprospecting and the cultural and spiritual dialogue that is taking place as we speak between the Indians and non-Indians in the Amazon basin. It has nothing, nothing to do with shamanism. Or apprenticeship. The title is pure deception.	2005-04-04

The attraction of this book is that, unlike most authors responsible for the ever proliferating literature on Andean peoples and their practices, Allen actually lived with the Indians, participated in their ceremonies, potato planting, festivals and travels. The book provides priceless descriptions of the labor divisions between men, women and children and of the interactions between the runa (i.e.,  Qechua for \\"people\\") themselves, between the runa and the city-dwelling mestizos and, perhaps most poignantly, between the people and the land.  The land for the Andean peasant is a living breathing organism that needs to be loved, feared and placated with gifts.  Each and every horizon marker has a personality, every hill possesses power and there are spirit beings inhabiting different \\"power spots\\" from the time immemorial.  The interactions between the people, the ancestors, the spirits and the land are part of the reality that needs to be reinforced every single day through little rituals, such as greeting the sun as one steps out of the door early in the morning.<br /><br />Coca represented here part of the glue that held everything together. The rituals that underlie coca chewing bind people in a neverending cycle of mutual obligation; in addition, coca is used as a main ingredient of despachos (ritual offerings) and a source of quiet energy during exhaustive labor on potato fields. Unfortunately, as a result of the demand for processed coca, cocaine, in the US, and the resulting pressure on the Andean countries by coca dealers and foreign goverements alike, the Peruvian peasants have found their access to raw coca leaves (non-addictive) severely limited, which affects a crucial aspect of their culture and cultural identity.<br /><br />Allen depicts all these elements (and much much more)  in a simple yet poignant narrative. Everything is exactly where it should be - she brings us close to the individual members of her extended ayllu so that the reader herself can participate. I found the frequent inserts of Quechua phrases especially useful, providing a direct link into the mode of the Andean thought.<br /><br />I highy recommend this book. probably the best one available, if you want to visit Qero regions in peru.in a simple yet poignant narrative.

In this light I am able to see inside others. I see everything as if I'm inside you.... The light sometimes seems to be inside other people. That light is given to us to see into others so we can find out what is wrong.<br />  Mamolelo Shikwe, Bushman Doctor<br /><br />This book provides a fascinating account of the spiritual universe of Kalahari Bushmen, mostly as a series of first-hand accounts from the \\"doctors\\". Keeney has spent a lot of time in Kalahari and has written a lot about his experiences there. In this book, he takes a back seat and allows the Bushmen to speak for themselves.  I was fascinated by the love these people have for God and for each other, a love which is uncomplicated, obvious and delightful, without the burdens of expectation or rationalization.  It is simple - when one is happy, one loves.  Dancing is a primary technology Bushmen use to enter that space of cleansing and communion with oneself and one's fellow beings. Bushmen healers obtain their \\"power\\" during healing dances. The power can come from ancestors, totem animals or directly from the Big God. The doctors themselves describe in great detail how this power arises in the belly, rises up and leaves the body \\"as steam\\" from the top of the head; then it falls down to the ground, rises through the feet and starts the process again. The process of becoming a doctor entails mastering this cycle of energy.  Interesting parallels with some Eastern methods for manipulating Qi.<br /><br />An initiate learns to see \\"lines or strings of light that go up to the sky\\" as well as horizontal lines across the physical world and learns to travel along these lines.  In the sky one meets the ancestors:<br /><br />\\"The oldest Bushmen ancestors have heads of animals, usually that of the eland. While I'm up in the sky village I may learn from the old ones or from the Big God. When it's time to come down the rope of light I bring the entire village (of ancestors) down with me to the ground where the dance is held. This is a very special moment. When this takes place, the whole community enters a spiritual time and space where the past and present are brought together as a singular moment.\\"<br /><br />While the material is fascinating, the way it was put together is somewhat haphazard and the \\"antropological\\" discussion at the end way too simplistic. Keeney is well aware of the difficulties in presenting and analzying something as fluid and as intangible as experiences of these doctors, each of whom has a different way of describing what they see and do and he basically leaves it at that. Still, this is a worthwhile book to get your hands on.village (of ancestors) down with me to the ground where the dance is held. This is a very special moment.

The information and guidance about how to live with the awareness of the Earth is often not easily accessible to us Westerners, or is set within New Age paradigms that for most are difficult to stomach. This is where Harmer's book comes in...  it is  based on the truth of one man's personal experience with an old indigenous medicine person.  Yet, Harmer is no Castaneda and his teacher is no imaginary Yaqui sorcerer ...  rather, we get so see life among present day Okanogan Salish in the American Northwest; Harmer learns from them as the Indians themselves have been learning from the time immemorial:  little by little, in bits and pieces. He is taught by his Salish mentors to observe nature, his dreams, and to integrate his lifetime experiences and traumas so as to increase his ability to perceive and act in the world.  I know of few books where the simplicity, pragmatism, reverence for nature and power that native peoples possess and wield has been demonstrated so effectively.<br /><br />There is much anthropology on Northwestern Indians, the Salish, Kwakiutl, the Tlingit....  a lot of academic crap, and very little about their real-time knowledge, wisdom and power. This book closes the gap & I recommed it highly, especially if you want to learn about native American dreaming practices, exorcism, spirits and, above all, about how to develop and practice perception skills and awareness.<br /><br />Above all, the book lays out quite starkly the choice each of us has to make for ourselves...do we serve the planet or its destroyers.

This is a great book for backpackers.<br /><br />Roberts writes in an easy informal style that weaves together information on history of  (Hopi, Acoma etc) pueblos and their relationship to the Anasazi, the archeology of the Southwest and its controversies and the thrill of chancing upon an artefact or building that has been constructed a thousand years ago and perhaps not seen by a living human for as many years.  Roberts provides a great intro into Anasazi history, including rise of early villages with their subterranean kivas, watching towers and jacals, grand pueblos such as that of the Chaco system and discusses at length the theories trying to explain the sudden depopulation of the Southwest which occurred after ~AD 1250. He also shows quite clearly that, in some way, Anasazi are still here - his Hopi informants were able, just by looking at Pueblo Bonito ruins, to predict the location of nearby shrines... as well as to interpret rock paintings and petroglyphs within the context of Hopi myths and oral traditions.  For me this was yet another (if subtle) proof of the amazing treasures (historical, spiritual) guarded for so many centuries on the Hopi mesas.<br /><br />The book also captures the beauty of the remote canyonlands in the northern Arizona and southeastern Utah, including the Mesa Verde and the awesome Grand Primitive Gulch, the conversations with the rangers and native guides, hiking expeditions with lamas, and above all, the magic that envelops people who visit this beautiful corner of the planet - magic that never lets go.  The magic that stimulated rangers, renegade archeologists and visitors to start  with the idea of a \\"natural museum\\" where you leave the artefacts where you found them, rather than report them to the Park Service (which will repatriate them to some dusty museum) or take them home (an instinctual reaction which harms both the artefact and its environment, as well as all travelers who would have enjoyed it in its natural setting).<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in traveling to the Southwest or learning more about the Mesas, pueblos and their original (and current) inhabitants.

This is an interesting book in which professional anthropologists dared to put off their straightjackets (if only for a second) to voice their suspicion - that the emperor is naked indeed.  One cannot escape a suspicion that for many of the authors academic anthropology as we know it today is a mostly useless discipline designed to confirm its own superstitions which have little to do with real life and everything with timidity and capitulation to the social consensus. This is, I fear, rather clear to most interested outsiders.... and increasingly to the anthros themselves (especially the younger ones willing to stick out their neck for their beliefs).<br /><br />The authors of the book chapters all profess (more or less timidly) their disenchantement with the discipline and narrate their own \\"extraordinary\\" experiences which cannot be fit within the framework of science as we know it. For anyone even remotely acquainted with native spiritual practices these experiences are all rather tame and unsurprising (i mean...what is all the fuss about?) yet it it may be useful to pause for a moment and realize that for your run o' the mill antropologist they represent nothing if not revolutionary revisions of reality as he/she knows it.  For example, one implication of the authors' experiences is that using statistics and \\"models\\" to address the role of awareness in creating reality is like using the proverbial flashlight in the search of darkness. As a result, this book has been conveniently ignored in the field and its authors more or less marginalized.<br /><br />Still... the edifice is crumbling and this book is bringing portents of its eventual downfall.	2004-11-04

The book is composed of several sections introducing the Qero reality archetypes, energy body, the system of energy fibres (ceques) connecting the awareness and material world and working with the spirits of the mountains (apus).  Another section is devoted to the Qero mesa and its stones; this includes very practical advice on how to establish rapport with a stone and about the importance of reciprocity (ayni, a key concept of Andean shamanism); at the end there are some additional instructions on clearing the luminous body of unhealthy energetic imprints, \\"metabolizing\\" heavy energy, communicating with the ancestors and gathering energy from nature.  A large part of the book is devoted to interviews with a group of respected Qero pampamesayoqs and altomesayoqs.<br /><br />Taken together, the book is a valuable (easily obtainable) resource for people interested in altiplano shamanism. For people more interested in the practical aspects of the Northern Coastal tradition I'd recommend Matthew Magee's Peruvian Shamanism; there is also the more scholarly Joralemon's work).  The book is respectful of the Qero but at the same time shows them with their human faces, humor and foibles. Thankfully it avoids both the supernatural crap that one finds in the New Age market and the dryness of professional scholars and sceptics...<br /><br />There are problems with this book, too.  The author herself, a member of the so-called \\"Nunez mafia\\",  is a beginner and is not in a position to achieve a synthesis of what she heard from the paqos (healers) and her experience. As a result, the accounts are sometimes inconsistent and at other times unclear.  The material for the book seems to have been collected in a single interview conducted over 3 days with a single group of Qe'ros; not speaking Quechua Wilcox was forced to rely on translations of her mestizo companions, who sometimes pushed their own (incorrect) interpretations (see the section on \\"pushing the kausay\\") which are duly recorded in the book.  Basically, Wilcox is trying to run before she has learnt to walk and one could, perhaps somewhat uncharitably, attribute to her self-promoting motives which are not necessarily in line with self-effacement that characterizes altiplano shamans. Moreover, the book appears hastily written and would definitely benefit from more editing.

Anything that decreases diversity of life (say, species extinction) is inherently evil. Where I'd agree with Watson is that the planet-destroying, profit-seeking  timber industry, corporations and evangelical Republicans fit the category of evilness rather well. However, this opens the question of the potential dichotomy between conscious and unconscious evil.<br /><br />While the book is worth picking up for its interesting naturalistic trivia, on the whole it does not deliver. If you're looking for an analysis of psychopathology, you will be dissapointed. W.s notions of evil do not encompass the possibility of \\"conscious\\" intention to harm life.  The naturalist Watson cannot  plunge into the depths of the psychopathic personality and into the origin of selfishness, separation, spite and fear.... which are wrecking the life on this planet.  There is no discussion of the relativeness of evil in some way, 'evil' is a matter of perspective. Is it evil to fumigate the termites out of your attic?<br /><br />Chaos is not so bad as Watson makes it. Another wy for it is spontaneity :).In some ways, evil, could be seen as unconscious energy seeking to manifest itself without regard to the universal principles that sustain life.	2004-11-03

It is written  well; Boyd managed to captureMad Bear's  culinary and other idiosyncrasies in a way which is genuinely funny and, at the same time, filled with valuable information about modern native medicine.  With native Americans  information rarely comes in an explicit way; likewise, the most valuable stuff in the book is hidden between the lines: the Tuscarora/Iroquois dreaming practices, the practices used to take care of and obtain feedback from nature and the commitment to working together with spiritually aware people from all over the planet.<br /><br />The Native Americans understand (suggests the book) that these are important times when teachings have to percolate from their keepers to a wider, global audience, that we have to work together to neutralize the forces of chaos and greed that are destroying the fabric of life on this planet and that life can be an amazing and mysterious adventure if one allows it to manifest itself through us.  These things are brought forth in an easy conversational style, especially in the first half; the second has to do more with specifics of Boyd's own participation in inter-Indian dialogue etc which I did not find as gripping.

Other tribes, such as the Crows (Absarokee), the Arapaho, or Gros Ventres tend to be overlooked. Especially Crows. These beautiful people were THE principal enemy of the Lakota and although just a fraction of their number, the Crows were very successful in heckling the Sioux bands and keeping them at bay.<br /><br /> These book is a recapitulation of the stories of such exploits. Stories, which would have been forgotten, if not for Joseph Medicine Crow... we hear about the introduction of the horse (in 1700s; the Crows call the horse &quot;ichilay&quot;, which means &quot;to search with&quot;), the &quot;buffalo jumps&quot;, invented by the Crows, and the interminable war parties and horse-stealing. The war was not waged for conquest, gain of property or territory: it was the ultimate sport, a game of wits, chivalry, bravery and honor between the tribes. The Crows were incredibly successful in raising horses: so succesful that in 1919 the secretary of the interior issued orders that they must get rod of their horses. The governement contracted bounty hunters, hired planes and helicopters and killed tens of thousands of animals... a tragic and traumatic experience for the Crows, which was worse than the military defeat. Still, the Absarokee were spared, to a large extent, the large scale depredations by the US military, due to to the role played by a Frenchman named Pierre Chienne, who practicaly wrote the provisions of the treaty that chief Blackfoot signed in 1868.<br /><br /> There are many stories about grizzly hunting, about old shamans, vision quests and military exploits. About the historic defeat of the Sioux, who tried to exterminate the Crow tribe in 1900s once and for all by attacking with 10 000 warriors.

It compiles, in one place, field data from the Northern tribes (Yurok, Karuk, Wintu, HUpa), Central California  (Miwok) and the South (Cahuilla, Luiseno etc).  In addition, there are chapters on rock art, toloache (the Datura-based religions of the Cahuillas, the Luiseno and even the Miwoks), the Kuksu (among Pomo and Maidu) religion and the Revival religions such as the Ghost dance.<br />A central concern of this book is that of the Native relationship with power: personal power, acquired by one's ability to perceive sacred beings and power sources (ritual paraphernalia, quartz crystals, human and animal bones, feathers, and plants such as angelica) and community power, derived from the shaman's status as a leader, healer and witch-doctor (In California as opposed to the Plains, priests and shamans usually came from chiefly families and were trained in high caste secret societies.  Power was, according to the Indians, differentially distributed in both time and space and came from the sacred \\"Dreamtime\\" when the universe was created.  The authors provide many anecdotes from transcribed sessions with their informants; what I especially liked was that, in general, the emphasis was on description and not on analysis. This makes for exciting reading.<br />Shamans were  political leaders, and they supervised the regular yearly burning process under oaks, pines and mesquite to maintain good harvests, control plant diseases, parasites (mistletoe), bugs and poison oak as well as to improve the quality of seed and straightness of basket grasses and arrow reed. They were also healers, prophets and poisoners enaging in \\"doctor wars\\".<br />I found the discussions on the use of datura, Rattlesnake shamans, Deer- or Antelope shamans, Bear shamans, Acorn shamans,  \\"Poison doctors\\" , soul loss and Singing doctors very informative. The poison doctors, for example, often obtained their powers hereditarily and were taught by a parent the use of quartz crystals and the eating of roots of poisonous plants, and they were encouraged to practice hitting a feather stuck in the ground as a target with porcupine quills so that they could successfully hit people with their darts. Many of these practices seem to me to be very similar to Australian aboriginal ones.<br />The book concludes with a couple of excellent chapter written by native Californian Indians themselves, and with an analysis of the worrisome encroachment of  non-native traditions (such as the sweat lodge, as it is practiced by the Plains tribes) into native (Californian) practices which are consequently facing the danger of disappearing, as the young strut the sexier Lakota style. Also we see the tenuous and often antagonistic interactions between the the New Age \\"neo-shamanism\\" and indigenous tribes, who resent the encroachment of the white man and his perceived usurpation of their religion.  This book doesn't take sides; it does however provide a valuable contribution that will be of interest to anthropologists and laypeople alike.s enaging in \\"doctor wars\\".<br />I found the discussions on the use of datura, Rattlesnake shamans, Deer- or Antelope shamans, Bear shamans, Acorn shamans,  \\"Poison doctors\\" , soul loss and Singing doctors very informative.

I can't believe that was a bad thing. At least we were not in danger of falling into absurdity, so common nowadays, of confusing the era of Sputniks and Polaris rockets with the era of Genesis&quot;.<br />It is hard for me to categorize this book; it is a spiritual book, illuminating one man's relationship with the Spirit; it is a profound meditation on the nature of truth, morality and friendship, and  it is a priceless analysis of  human nature. Blindness was no impediment to Lusseyran - on the contrary, he learnt to use his senses with an uncanny precision to represent facts by creating visual imagery, to identify the motives that drive people and countries and to establish contact with the transcendental essence of all Being.  &quot;People were not at all what they were said to be, and never the same for more than two minutes at a stretch. Some were, of course, but that was a bad sign, a sign that they did not want to understand or be alive, that they were somehow caught in the glue of some indecent passion. ... It is strange that when laws men make are so ticklish in matters concerning the body, they never set limits to nakedness or contact by voice. Evidently they leave out of account the fact that the voice can go further than hands or eyes in licit or illicit touch.&quot;<br />This book is very valuable for its insights on the nature of blindness and sensory-emotional reorganization that accompanies it.  &quot;Blindness works like dope, a fact we have to reckon with. ...Like drugs, blindness heightens certain sensations, giving sudden and often disturbing sharpness to the senses of hearing and touch. But, most of all, like a drug, it develops inner as against outer experience, and sometimes to excess&quot; (p.49).<br />I just cannot help myself from quoting from this book, it is so full of unforgettable passages. This is from the time he was caught, as a member of the Resistance, by the Gestapo: (p. 245): &quot;One small piece of advice. IN a spot like this, do not go too far afield for help. Either it is right near you, in your heart, or it is nowhere. It is not a question of character, it is a question of reality. If you try to be strong, you will be weak. If you try to understand, you will go crazy. No, reality is not your charaqcter which, for its part, is only a by-product - I can't define it, a collection of elements. Reality is Here and Now. It is the life you are living in the moment. Don't be afraid to lose your soul there, for God is in it.&quot;<br />As you can see, this book was written by a remarkable man, who could &quot;see&quot; life and truth and humaneness better than many of his fellow men.  Now,  when our times in some ways resemble the late 30ies and we again seem to be descending into the darkness of ignorance, when the world is run by corrupt, greedy and cynical men who value their comfort above and beyond the dignity of their souls and happiness of their fellow men, Lusseyran's book provides a ray of light and a courage.

The Minianka have been able to resist the depredations which occur when  Islam or X-ianity enters African societies; they are animist, that is, they still observe and follow ancient laws that emphsize the interdependence between humans, nature and the transcendent realms. Music to the Minianka music is much more than entertainment.  It is used for work, celebration, ritual, inititations, funerals and healing; each activity (as well as each profession and each person) has its own special rhythms and harmonies. The MInianka understand music as a bridge between the visible and invisible. As such, it is used to establish harmonious relationships between an individual, his community, his ancestors and the Creator. Every night there is dancing at the village square - and EVERYBODY dances. Minianka musicians  learn to transpose the essence of their fellow men's characters  into music, so that when a villager gets to dance, he is greated by  rhythms which match his/her character and emotional configuration.  By observing closely, the musicians can adapt the music to the needs of the listener and thereby lead them to health. In Minianka villages, says Diallo, \\"musicians are healers, the healers musicians....  Music...amplifies to our sense the unheard tones and unseen waves that weave together the matter of existence.  The beat, the rhythm, the timing, the orchestration, the flow, the balance between action and rest must all be within well-defined limits...and the music becomes a healing art that helps restore emotionally and psychologically disturbed people to harmonious human functioning. \\"<br />THe book is well written and brings us a close -up of Fienso, the village of Diallo's childhood. I found the descriptions of initiation ceremonies, daily work, secret societies very interesting.  It made me see  the Minianka society as an extremely sophisticated - where there is place for everyone and where everybody is interconnected in a web of mutual obligations between people, spirits and God. Unfortunately, the interdependence on mutual obligations makes the African society also fragile; when reciprocity inherent in such webs is interrupted, as during incursions of oil and diamond money, radical X-ianity or Islam, the African society collapses and we get what we see today in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Liberia or Sudan - lack of harmony and lack of peace.<br />Still, we would be fools to pass the opportunity to learn what Africans have to teach us.  Music is one of the keys that can open the door of the gilded cage in which the giant of  industrial nihilism has imprisoned us and Yaya Diallo shows us in this wonderful book, that it is possible to open one's body, spirit and destiny to the amazing world of harmony and beauty where true healing occurs.descriptions of initiation ceremonies, daily work, secret societies very interesting.

There were a few things Carlos forgot to ask for on that hilltop before leaving his detested Caxamalca:  he asked for money, fortune, fame, beautiful chickas and power.  What he forgot to ask for were love,  humility, peace and God.  Amy Wallace shows us in this book that this was a terrible bargain to make.<br /><br />She shows us a Castaneda who was authoritarian, manipulative, paranoid and infantile; the pudgy little man exhibited the worst traits of an insecure macho, including posturing, jealousy,  racism and lechery. It was perhaps a terrible inevitability that made the 65 year old cabron  pick Amy, the  daughter of a well-known writer (and a talented writer in her own right) for one of his victims. Amy shows us how C kept a harem of women cajoled and intimidated into providing sexual favors in the worst tradition of guru-xploitation. The way he got them into his bed was pathetic. [ \\"Amy\\", he whispered (to the 25 year-old Amy Wallace). Suddenly, he was more solemn than I'd ever seen him. \\"You have to give your poto to the nagual. For magical purposes we must have a \\"close encounter.\\" It's the only way left to us. The hole between a woman's legs is magic and when the nagual leaves his juice inside it goes directly to her brain...it's the fastest way.\\" (p. 81)].  For all the obsession Castaneda had with sex  one does not have an impression Castaneda actually ENJOYED intimacy.  Intimacy, love, caring were, well, all too human (\\"ape-like\\").<br /><br /> What made me sad and profoundly angry was reading about C's efforts to deprive his \\"disciples\\" and \\"lovers\\"  of their essence, of who they truly were; only then would he feel comfortable, in control.  The man made them break all contact with their families and friends -even destroy the photographs depicting their \\"previous\\" selves; Amy was ordered to get rid of her beloved cats.  When he had his women isolated, he started with emotional abuse and sexual melodrama.<br /><br /> The man is described as a classical psychopath.  \\"I confessed\\", wrote Castaneda in one of his books, \\"that I have never respected or liked anybody, not even myself, and that I had always felt I was inherently evil.\\" As de Mille said:  \\"Carlos cannot open his gap and let his passion flow into another person. He cannot commit himself to anything but the separate reality, first in his mind, then on paper....Telling stories excites him but only displays his power to fill up the social world with cobwebs.\\"  Wallace shows us the profile of an old child, a congenital liar, who felt helpless and deeply afraid of women and female power, just as he was afraid of life and love.  Not surprisingly, the man's fears of women, sex and love creep up in his books. Castaneda had grown callous to pain and sadness and incapable of seeing anyone else's right to freedom but his own.<br /><br />  Amy's book also begs the question about whether the stuff Carlos wrote about was real or not. One of Castaneda's prime talents was to find, select, transform, marshall, and present other people's ideas as his own without letting the sources show.  The experiences of \\"Carlos\\" may then well be true. As is this book. Wallace's  journey is a Tale of true Power: power to survive  vile spiritual assaults with grace and with love. She shows us how dehumanizing the control of one human being over another can be for everyone involved and how this has destroyed the creator of Don Juan.

Hudson, a young adventurer, spent 14 months in a Mandingko village, observing and commenting on the daily life. Amazingly, he was allowed to join one of the women's societies... so he followed them around, participated in their dances, field work and intrigues and documented this stuff in OGD. Hudson shows that African women are, although destined to a life of hard work, circumcission & mostly unhappy arranged marriages, far from helpless creatures. They are economically independent, they are free to choose their lovers, they sing and they dance:<br />\\"It was in the early hours of the morning before the dancing began in earnest, the figures of the women glowing as though golden in the light of the hurricane-lamp, as they came running towards the drummers, spinning around only at the last moment to dance. This was what they liked more than anything elese - the extremity of this total bodily exertion, this fervent, almost ecstatic unleashment of energy, in which every muscle, every last atom of their energy would be used. It was as though the rhythms of the drums..[...]... were touching something actually inside the women themselves, to which their frenetic shaking was an involuntary, though wholly pleasurable response. They called it dia - sweetness.\\"<br />\\"Hear the sound of these drums!<br />Our own drums!<br />Here the sound of these drums!<br />Our grandmothers' drums!\\"<br />Hudson shows that African life can be strange beyond our imagining.  The pragmatic and relaxed attitudes towards the body and sexual activity; the separatedness of women and men, who get together pretty much just for sex; the ancient initiation formulas and rites, the pragmatic interpretation of the Muslim religion mixed with animism and, above all, the aliveness of these people get through in this book really well. These Mandingko use their bodies for pleasure in a way which makes Westerners look like hollow emaciated specters lost in our greedy little calculating minds. There is much fun in African lives and much sadness - sadness that we have forgotten about.<br /> We need to learn from Africans about how to inhabit our bodies and about how to live in the present moment and this book gives us first hand information on these topics.  Highly recommended.ok like hollow emaciated specters lost in our greedy little calculating minds.

Dreams have always been mportant to the Indans; consequently, sets of highly specialized techniques for lucid dreaming and efficient retrieval of the dream material (similarities to Tibetans here) can be found across many different tribes.  \\"To become a medicine person\\", writes Lake, \\"you must have faith in the Great Creator, the dreams, the spirits, the good powers, and in yourself. At first dreams bring the calling and initiation into shamanhood; later they become tools for self-discovery, spiritual self-development, protection, diagnosis and healing.\\"  According to Lake, all illness has a symbolic component. \\"In order to heal the patient, the source of \\"stress\\" - the symbol, the physical object, the form of power and the fear associated with it - must be transformed and eradicated.\\"  Interesting stuff:  to heal the patient one has to address both the physical and the mental/spiritual.  Modern medicine (the \\"integrative medicine\\") is discovering the same thing these days. Nihil sub sole novum!<br />The book provides  specific information on sweat lodges, vision quests and on lake's training as a native healer. One basic message is that the path of a native shaman is  filled with trials and tribulations.  Lake has learnt his trade the hard way and he doesn't want the reader to forget it. For me, one of the highlights of the book is his interview with  Tela Starhawk (his ex-wife), a formidable medicine woman in her own right, talking about female shamanic practices.<br />What I  like in this book are the descriptions of Native attitudes towards nature and life - the reverence for all living creatures and the sensitivity and awareness of the signs, through which nature speaks to us. I recommend it.	2004-01-11

European shamanism (including druidism) is thought to have been largely stamped out due to the combined efforts of Enlightenement and the Holy Inquisition.  The book opens up the question of the many similarities between Germanic, Latin, Slavic agricultural cults and their relationship to the Dionysian rituals as well as the issue of universality of core beliefs that underly indigenous practices around the world.<br />The book also pioneers a new understanding of Europeans and their history - one that focuses on the peasant and his relationship with the land (and the Church).  The aristocratic elite that controlled the politics and religion of mediaeval Italian city states was just a tiny fraction of the population; Ginzburg therefore opens up a new (and should i say delicious) can of worms.<br /> This  book represents a huge step forward in our understanding of European shamanism.  Ginzburg burrows deep into the 16th century Inquisition archives  from the Friuli region of Northern Italy (where Latin, Slavic and Germanic traditions come together). He returns with a fascinating discovery of an ancient fertility cult, whose participants (the benandanti) represented themselves as defenders of harvest and fertility of the fields.  A benandante was someone who four times a year during the Ember days  left the body and went \\"invisibly in spirit\\" to fight the witches and the devil - \\"we fight over all the fruits of the earth and for those things won by the benandanti that year there is abundance\\", said a peasant while questioned by the Inquisition. The benandanti were united by a common element of having been born with the caul (i.e., wrapped in the placenta, which was thought to be an object endowed with magical powers). The departure of the spirit from the body, which was left lifeless, was understood as an actual separation, an event fraught with perils, almost like death. The soul was considered very real and tangible. \\"We crossed over water like smoke and following combat, everyone returned home as smoke...\\".  The soul was always associated with a spirit animal (usually hare, but also pig, rooster, mouse etc.). This was  a world of spells, incantations,  evil eye, herbal potions, spirits and communication with the dead.<br />Ginzburg shows that these beliefs in 16th century peasants were all-pervasive and deeply connected with Earth and its cycles. The Ember Days (i.e., Christmas) festivities had survived from ancient agricultural cults and symbolized the changes of seasons, the passage from the old to the new time of year and a promise of planting, harvest, reaping and autumn vintage. Ginzburg paints a interesting picture of Italian Inquisition -  that of a huge centralized organization which was inefficient, swamped with bureaucratic legalisms and in most cases not that interested in prosecuting \\"ignorant peasants\\" .  The book also champions a rather controversial thesis according to which the Church managed to steer the perception of the benandanti cult from representing fertility rites to that of witchcraft and the devil, almost as if the Church created the very devil that it abhorred.

First and foremost, it presents us with the views and attitudes of one of the world's foremost anthropologist-explorers from the beginning of the 20th century. This means lots and lots of passion and enthusiasm, a willingness to risk one's life in pursuit of an elusive goal and an ability to follow one's gut instincts. All traits which, sadly, have practically dissapeared from modern anthropology.  In addition, of course, the book is permeated with the spirit of the times (1910-40ies) - which means patronizing attitudes toward the natives (the \\"savages\\", who for the most part clearly resented the tasks of having to clear the jungle, build bridges across impassable rapids and climb hills infested with snakes) and an eurocentric view of the world which now seems a bit  naive.<br />All this being said, I must emphasize that this book is a treasure and a must read for anyone about to visit Macchu Picchu - if only to contrast the conditions encountered by Bingham and his Indians to those that exist today, when busloads of clueless tourists are delivered straight to the Temple of the Sun. The first third of the book consists of a superb Introduction including a recapitulation of the16th century records of the Incas and their empire (including the awesome Pachakuti Inca), very competent review of Inca technology (many of their and an excellent recapitulation of the life stories of the last 4 Incas. The last part describes the actual \\"discovery\\" of Macchu Picchu which occured by procuring, for a silver coin,  the services of Anacleto Alvarez, a local Qechua who had been living among the ruins all along. Macchu Pichu therefore had never been truly \\"lost\\"  and \\"discovery\\" has in this context many interesting connotations.<br />For my part, I have a respect for Bingham and for his guts that served him so well. In time, for example, they led him to the US Senate (from Connecticut).  I suspect it will take many a pachakuti (turning of the Wheel of Time) till another anthropologist gets an opportunity to represent Democracy and the People.e Wheel of Time) till another anthropologist gets an opportunity to represent Democracy and the People.	2003-12-12

US	45656894	RJHK1RMGZA724	006092554X	732091569	The Art of Dreaming	Books	4	30	34	N	N	Hmmmm.....	Castaneda is always a valuable read.  The man has, single-handedly, introduced more fundamental concepts into the contemporary mainstream of  shamanic studies than anyone else I know.  Assemblage point, luminous fibers, medicine plants, spiritual warrior, dreaming, stalking are now commonly accepted terms and, dare i say it, practices?! At the same time, the man himself  -dead and alive - has eluded attempts at categorization; he is not as prissy as Eliade, simplifier and popularizer like Harner, neither does he seem to be in for the money, like perhaps the majority of book-writing modern would-be  &quot;shamans&quot; and &quot;sorcerers&quot;.  Methinks this very fact should make one curious and interested.<br />The Art of Dreaming does not disappoint in this regard.  It seems to be quite consistent with C's previous work and IMO C is quite effective in depicting the complexity of the worlds that may be accessed during one's dreams.  For ordinary humans like you and me this work reads like fiction, because in order to access even the most rudimentary of these worlds, one would (according to Castaneda) need &quot;energy&quot; acquired through time-consuming and effort-full practices.  We don't have this kind of energy.  Yet myself, at the very least, have a deep respect and admiration for this wily old man who gave us so much food for thought.

The Songhay have once possessed the largest empire in African history; their formidable magician-king Sunni Ali created an elaborate and effective administrative system extending all the way up to Timbuktu and even Morrocco and, as Stoller shows in this book, Sunni Ali's memory is still very much alive in contemporary Niger.<br />The book follows Stoller as he wanders around Songhay villages trying to document social mores. He quickly finds what M. Mead never did - that polling and questionnaire techniques he was taught in the US do not work with the Songhay. In Niger, a direct question typically elicits an outright lie; effective field work consists of listening and participating whereas direct interrogation is counter-productive.  Stoller then falls into the hands of a local \\"sorko\\", or magician-healer, who offers to teach him the secrets of the trade.  At this point, the author is faced with the question: should one maintain, in bona fide anthropological work, classical aims of \\"objectivity\\" and \\"impartiality\\" or should one immerse oneself totally and completely into indigenous life, risking drowning into it and 'compromising' science? Stoller does neither: he is awed by the power and mystery of the secrets that he is witnessing yet at the same time he has difficulty operating them. As, I imagine, would you and me, faced with the harsh reality of indigenous 'sorcery'.<br /><br />For me, the book provides more evidence for the hypothesis that the \\"Western paradigm\\" is just one of many, and not that empowering at that. If we start to tinker with our paradigm by \\"apprenticing\\" to cultures based on hard, merciless and pragmatic obsession with spiritual power (such as the Songhay) we are in for a tough ride.  Stoller was; he distanced himself  and I do not blame him.<br /><br />The book is a great read. I found it difficult to put down. The dialogues in this book are great and often funny and the book is a must read for anyone contemplating visiting Niger, Mali or Burkina Faso. I wish there was a sequel.ogues in this book are great and often funny and the book is a must read for anyone contemplating visiting Niger, Mali or Burkina Faso. I wish there was a sequel.	2003-09-19

Miriam Makeba, the famous singer, suggested to James Hall (the author of \\"Sangoma\\") that there may be more than meets the eye in his fascination with Africa and African-American women.  Hall followed her advice and consulted a Swazi witch doctor (\\"sangoma\\") who declared, to surprise of all, that Hall was destined to become a sangoma himself. This book depicts his travails leading to his initiation into the circle of Swazi healers.<br />It was a bittersweet path, filled with encounters with supernatural (Hall turned out to possess access to many different spirits, including those of a Native American, a NY advertising executive and - wait for this  - a fetus).  In addition to description of his training, Hall provides valuable accounts of his interactions with ordinary Swazis (some good, some bad; there seem to be as many racially intolerant people in Africa as everywhere else) and, especially, with women.  Hall shows that relationships between men and women in Swaziland are pragmatic, based on exchange of material goods and services rather than sentimental.<br />Throughout the book we participate in Hall's inner life, his decisions and his torments as well as in his decision to adopt a parentless child and marry the woman he fell in love with.  Hall now lives and practices in Swaziland and I think Swazis are lucky to have such a courageous, dedicated, life-affirming and generous sangoma.	2003-09-18

While a lot has been published about Native American (both North and South), Tibetan, Altaic, Celtic etc.  tribal life, rather little is known about Africa.  Malidoma Some's book therefore provides a welcome and highly inspiring contribution.<br />With this book Malidoma ('Be Friends With the Enemy') creates a bridge into a world where a person's life is linked inextricably to the breathing of his village and where his destiny interlocks with that of his ancestors, his children and the rhythms of nature. It is a world imbued with meaning; the Dagara share it with tree and animal spirits, with supernatural entities (the kontomble, the \\"star people\\") and with ancestors who provide guidance and support.  Malidoma also addresses topics of universal importance to all of us.  What is a complete human being? Why does one need to be \\"initiated\\" into living in order to be \\"real\\"? How do we awaken and use all the resources stored in the \\"inner museum of our being\\"; what is the role of mystery and awe in the unfolding of our destinies and how does one learn to become available to them?<br />The book is written along the lines of ancient storytelling, and in a flowing delicate prose which radiates human warmth and respect for life. MS does a great job in depicting the Dagara as a spiritually aware people still attuned to their roots and their land. I understand that now, after his father's death, Malidoma has returned to Africa (temporarily abandoning his privileged and lucrative position within the Western \\"shamanic circuit\\") to assume his duties as a leader of his clan and as a mediator between the worlds that his people still remember and give homage to. He is a savy man who demonstrated to us all that befriending the enemy brings gifts to all involved in the process as it combines and integrates different yet complementary pools of knowledge. Myself I listen with deep appreciation and respect as the Dagara sing:<br />I want to be what I know I am,<br />And take the road we always<br />  Forget to take.<br />Because I heard the smell<br />  Of the things forgotten<br />And my belly was touched.that befriending the enemy brings gifts to all involved in the process as it combines and integrates different yet complementary pools of knowledge.

Deloria and Wildcat analyze, in this eminently practical and thoughtful book, the causes and conditions that led to this state of affairs.  They identify the European dialectic method as one of the key factors that alienate Native Americans.  The problem, as they see it, is far from benign - dialectics as practiced in the academia not only champions a simplistic cause-and-effect reasoning which is far removed from the Indian tendency to view the world in a holistic, pan-theistic manner...  it also produces isolated, self-absorbed individuals  separated from their own bodies and their own society.  Such separation is incomprehensible to the Indians, who view themselves primarily as members of a community and for whom individual achievements are largely meaningless without the context of the community support.<br />Another significant difference between the Native and Western educational approaches, say VD and DW, are that while the former stress personal growth from the early childhood on,  the latter concentrate on factual learning during which the harmonious development of the personality  takes the second seat to professional development.  This produces what to the Indian seem deviant and psychopathic characters completely out of touch with their community and nature, focused as they are on making money and selfish personal advancement.<br />DeLoria and Wildcat offer several solutions which may aid native americans in navigating the perilous universe of disconnectedness that they face in the world-at-large while keeping to their values and worldviews.  Even more, they identify how these values may actually aid them in becoming succesful without compromising themselves.<br />Recommended.	2003-07-24

Although Wallace is a Rosebud medicine man with impeccable credentials, he has become too well known and that means he has broken an unspoken taboo  that cannot be forgiven within his community.  Many Native Americans, like so many other peoples (indigenous or not) simply cannot tolerate the success of one of their own and are prepared to do anything to bring them down.  After all, a true member of the tiospaye is supposed to be self-effacing, humble, generous... and poor.<br />I cannot be a judge of Black Elk's character.  But I know a good thing when I see it. Anyone who has had even remote experience of Lakota healing ceremonies will know immediately that with this book we are given a great gift. The book will be useful to all who want to understand social and ceremonial aspects of Lakota  life and the practical manifestation of their worldview and religious practice. God knows that our country and our planet are in need of these teachings. We get highly useful descriptions of major rituals, such as the Kettle Dance, the sweat lodge and the &quot;vision quest&quot;;  more importantly, we get an intimate glimpse into a Lakota medicine man's relationship with his spirit helpers and guides and with his sacred pipe (Chanunpa).  The book bristles with the reverence for the pipe and with acknowledgement that the medicine man is only a channel (&quot;a hollow bone&quot;) for the Spirit.  There can be no question about Black Elk's credentials, about the validity and importance of his experiences and his ability to heal people through  sacred Lakota ceremonies.<br />The book is also funny in a way that Lakota themselves can be funny by being at the same time self-deprecatory  and self-congratulatory.  Black Elk obviously enjoyed the process of describing his experiences;  he also inserts a few pages on his encounters with unindentified flying objects and their denizens but I suggest the reader checks this out for herself.<br />In short, this is a warm, informative and rewarding book that addresses crucial elements of Lakota religious life through the words of an authentic practitioner. It glows with gratitude to Great Spirit, Mother Earth and the Chanunpa.

In it, we mainly get his personal views and experiences of the &quot;Natural Way&quot; which, generally speaking, represent the tradition of his native Lakota Sioux.  McGaa's credentials are pretty good: he claims to have studied with Frank Fools Crow and Bill Eagle Feather,  without doubt two of the most influential Sioux medicine people.  This therefore is an opportunity to partake of life experiences of an insider who is willing to share his views of God, religion, spirits and interconnectedness of life.  We learn of such key elements of Lakota worldview as the 6 Powers, the Wakamaskan (animal brothers), yuwipi, Sun Dance, details of Black Elk's vision and the attitude of reverence and respect towards the &quot;Great Mystery&quot;.  Native Americans cannot comprehend the concept of a wrathful, revengful God, nor can they understand the concepts of sin and &quot;being saved&quot;.  They have seen what we have forgotten - that what makes a person harmonious, kind and peaceful is their closeness to Nature which gifts them the power of presence (is it therefore surprising to see that the people who wreak discord in the world are characterized by their disconnectedness from Nature and their own bodies?)<br />McGaa has a lot of beef with organized religion and by golly do I agree with him.  According to him, the concept of heaven and hell was great for the priests trying to to keep in control ignorant masses. The more we shed our ignorance, the closer we get to the Great Spirit and the freer we are from the leeches trying to take over our spiritual life. This is why, says McGaa, knowledge is so crucial. Knowledge leads to wisdom, wisdom leads to understanding, and understanding leads to peace.  The key to developing knowledge is observation.  We do not have to believe anything : it is enough to be patient, observe and draw conclusions for oneself.<br />In short, this is an eminently practical book written by a knowledgeable person of great integrity.

Mary Brave Bird's life story sheds light on traditions of her Lakota (Sioux) people from the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations in South Dakota. She shows, in a very clear way,  their tortured history with the missionaries, state bureaucracy, the courts, the FBI and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). We see to what extent the government has succeeded in destroying the old life and how small groups of the Sioux managed to preserve traditional ways and ceremonies.<br />The book is written in a way which preserves the unique appreciation Indians have for unadulterated truth - a style which is simple, direct and in which personal experiences are recounted in a frank, almost brutally dispassionate manner. It reveals perfectly the heartless school system ran by abusive Catholic priests and nuns trying hard to deprive young people of their traditions (don't these people have better things to do?); we see the corrupt BIA system designed to prevent cultural and economic emancipation of the Native American \\"traditionals\\" (and steal federal money) and the pointless fear that the FBI has of organized Indian movements. Above all, we see the violence that the Sioux face daily from the white  South Dakotans as well as the inter-Sioux violence caused by the hopelessness of the life on the rez. I was especially amazed to see that South Dakota has preserved, at the least up to early 1980ies, the barbaric attitudes towards the Native Americans (who are, after all, the original inhabitants, and who were cheated out of their own land by the very same whites who persecute them) which have by and large disappeared from the rest of the civilized world. This includes (unpunished) assaults by drunken lumberjacks and ranchers, systematic discrimination in the courtroom, forced sterilizations  at the provincial hospitals (Mary's own sister Barbara was sterilized against her own will) and a system designed to eliminate all of the Indians' most courageous and spiritually conscious young people. A system that would make Uncle Mao proud, but which made this reader very sad,  ashamed and angry. I suspect many of these things are still going on in our name. I mean, why can't these people leave the Indians in peace, allow them to practice their religion and (is this too much to ask for?) respect their desire to be different?<br />There are also many wonderful things in this book. The descriptions of relationships between Lakota men and women, between the young and the old, between the full and half-bloods and between the host and the guest are simply priceless. Likewise Brave Bird's descriptions of peyote meetings, Sundances and Ghostdance revivals. Mary has very strong opinions about the Sioux male machismo and the reluctance exhibited by many Sioux men to providing a comfortable and loving home for their families yet she understands that this is the inevitable consequence of the systematic destruction of the old ways of tribal life. After having read the book I can see the challenges facing the indomitable Sioux nation, the challenge of preserving and honoring the old ways while educating a new elite familiar with the white system (without considering them to be sellouts); only when they gain political representation and economic self-sufficiency will Native Americans be able to keep at bay the greedy timber, mining and ranching industries whose interest is to keep the tribes divided and the people dispirited and lost in alcohol.

As opposed to other  stories about tracking which border the domain of fiction (e.g., \\"The Way of the Scout\\"), Brown gives us in this Field Guide practical advice on reading animal tracks, constructing shelters etc.  The tips on \\"Nature Observation\\"  in this field guide are unsurpassed by any other tracking book I know. TB provides us with priceless descriptions of what happens the moment we enter the forest - that is, how the alarm signal spreads from the birds to mammals and how long it takes for it to subside. The forest he is talking about is a living entity, where everything is connected and where one can plug into the circuits of the information flow by learning to listen to the sounds, by studying the terrain and the wind and by knowing how to camouflage and mask one's smell. The book provides useful info on various types of walking/stalking in the woods. Finally, there is deep reverence for nature  something which occurs when one has learnt to be silent amidst the whispering trees (no mean trick for the Westerner who tends to function through the head). Tom Brown has learnt the inner silence tricks from his Apache teacher (\\"the Grandfather\\") and trackers might find this book useful for learning more about  Native American attitudes toward nature. A similar approach to nature is encountered in some of Paul Rezendes' books (which i also recommend). In short, this book will be useful to those who are interested in approaching nature on its own terms.

Tom Robbins managed to put into it all that matters: mushrooms, Tarot, Dogons, dolphins,the Nature of Reality, Sirius B, God, as well as the mysterious amphibian human ancestors, the Nommo which are supposed to be in a telepathic contact with the human race. Written with the metaphorical bravura and wit that have become Robbins' trademarks, the book follows Gwen, a wannabe bookie at a Seattle brokerage house as she grapples with a series of unforeseeable events which include a market crash, a kleptomaniac monkey, a Van Gogh loving Native American, rectal enema and Larry, a recent graduate from the Timbuktu University. Tim is a master of the art of \\"living on the Pad\\".  While his book is consistently funny and has a couple of excellent sex scenes, the characters, the plot and the style of writing are rather similar to other R. books. The female protagonist is spunky, sexy, naïve and lacking something that only the male protagonist can provide: spiritual guidance. Despite all the joking (which I enjoyed), the undertone of HAFP is essentialy moralistic . Larry Diamond (whom I suspect to be a Robbins Doppelganger of sorts), is especially tedious with his endless sermons and unfunny misogynic quips. Nevertheless, the message when taken out of its pajamas is positive: it is about taking risks, listening to the Great Mystery and en-joying oneself.	2003-01-03

The book is devoted to Villoldo's experiences with two  Peruvian healers - don Ramon Silva (an ayahuascero from the Peruvian Amazon) and don Antonio Morales, (a Qero style healer and philosophy professor!).  Villoldo's recounting of Peruvian healing practices is  gripping and the final chapter, in which he describes the death of his teacher's teacher in a little cottage on the Peruvian altiplano, is simply breath-taking.  I also quite liked the description of the \\"operation\\" which allowed V. to see energy patterns and his animal allies.<br />If V. only recounted his experiences with the old shamans, the book would have been superb. Unfortunately, he decided to insert into the book his own personal issues and musings on the nature of reality (which tend to go on and on) and which to me seem to be rather cliche-y.  this guy is a doer, not a thinker and all the theory just detracted me from the magic of his experiences.  V. also seems to be unduly impressed by his newly acquired Ph.D. in psychology (from a little known local college) as if a degree means anything these days.<br />Still, I find Villoldo's accounts to be trustworthy and in my opinion this book is a useful read for people interested in Peruvian healing practices and in energy work in general.	2002-12-19

Each chapter begins with an excerpt from Villoldo's Journal written during his training sesions with the teachers from the Q'ero nation, and with the healers he encountered in the Peruvian and Brazilian rainforest. Villoldo then goes on to describe the foundations of energy medicine and ends most chapters with simple exercises to give us the taste of what he is writing about.  Myself i am interested in parallels between various shamanic practices and energy training in martial arts and SHS provided several useful tips. However, the practical usefulness of this book is probably limited,  because even the simplest exercises need verification and support by a qualified teacher.<br />I find the information in this book to be (to the best of my knowledge) accurate, provided by a competent and well-trained specialist. The stories about the Q'ero shamans and their training are especially interesting. These people have a  sophisticated understanding of consciousness and of the issues related to death and dying. As all indigenous shamans, they are intimately connected to nature and show amazing skills taping forces residing within the majestic landscape of the Cordilleras. i think it is high time we start to look at the Q'ero with new respect.<br />In my view this is probably one of the best books available on Peruvian shamanism and its applicability to the Western practice of \\"integrative medicine\\". i recommend it.	2002-11-19

What is an awakening? Who am I? What is God?<br />A lot of ink has been spilt in trying to address these questions. The mind likes to lose itself in existential dilemmas and it likes elaborate theologies.  Sometimes it is not easy to see whether asking these questions or reading &quot;spiritual books&quot; brings one closer to Being or pushes one farther away.  This book is a step in the right direction.<br />Jacobson strips the spiritual endeavour to its bones.  According to him, what matters is to be present and still and to own every aspect of ourselves, no matter how abhorrent it may appear to the ego (mind).  We have to learn to surrender patterns of control in our lives, stop believing in our thoughts and beliefs and release the past. The only way to do this is to learn to honor our feelings and to allow the heart to speak once again and to  &quot;make sure that there is nothing in our lives which we love more than God&quot;.<br />There is a lot of talk about God in this book.  Myself I am not necessarily religious in the old fashioned sense of the word, yet Jacobson's reverence and delicateness impressed me and shifted something. The way Jacobson sees God as related to Presence and Silence and interconnectedness, and yet as unfathomable and mysterious, speaks to  me and also reminds me of what I consider to be the best in Buddhist thought.<br />In any case, you can't miss with this book.

First of all, one notices a revisionist streak with respect to history as we know it: the Toltecs who built Teotihuacan were an aggressive militaristic culture, far from the peace-loving sages portrayed by Ruiz. So who are his \\"Toltecs\\"? I must confess I have been disappointed by the \\"shamanic wisdom\\" dispensed with by Ruiz. It looks to me that this guy combines simple common sense (\\"be impeccable with your word\\"; \\"don't take anything for granted\\" etc.) with terminology filched from Castaneda (stalking, luminous egg, assemblage point, second awareness etc) and spices it up with a New Agey dose of guru worship. Apparently, the impeccability and a loving heart did not prevent Ruiz from snagging his new partner Gaya from a happy marriage of 25 years; the mumbo jumbo of soul- mating going back for 13+ generations made me uneasy with the whole work.<br />To me it seems the book's aim is to make Ruiz look like a guru. If he's a guru, who are his gurus? What are Ruiz's influences?  Clearly, Zacharia Sitchin with his extraterrestrials is a huge presence; then of course Castaneda, maybe Blavatsky who one might expect a cultured Mexican to be familiar with.  Who are Ruiz's teachers? Who made a \\"nagual\\" out of him? Apart from his grandmother, there seems to be nobody. Ruiz's insights mainly come from \\"visions\\" obtained during journeying amidst the ruins of Teotihuacan.  This is where he got all the (specific!) information about, say, Atlantis, Lemuria,  and other similar and beloved fables of old.<br />I think Ruiz has reached the pinnacle of new age shamanism. In this book we get a synthesis of his endeavours, that is, a skillful package offering exactly what a contemporary seeker for ancient ways might be looking for. For me it was unsatisfying and unconvincing.  My recommendation would be to read Jamie Sams.	2002-06-06

De Mello was a universally respected Jesuit priest who managed to go far beyond the orthodox catholic dogma and into the very heart of  spiritual alivennes and connectedness. Several centuries earlier a similar attempt was made by Loyola, another Jesuit troublemaker; however, in A., DeMello dispenses with the extraneous mumbo jumbo and goes straight to the heart of the matter. God is presence itself and through awareness we are simultaneously connected to who we truly are and to the sacredness of all life. De Mello reminds us time and again of this simple yet profound truth; i especially admire his skilfull use of anecdote and parable, which reminds me of another great spiritual teacher... Perhaps it is not coincidental that De Mello lived and worked in Goa, that syncretic ex-Portuguese colony known for its eccentric inhabitants and practices. What impresses me the most about this book is that DeMello manages to weave into his teachings the best elements of Buddhist and Hindu traditions (their emphasis on awareness, mindfulness) and combines them with what is best in Christianity (the emphasis on love, openness of the heart). In addition to that, he is consistently funny (no mean feat for a work on spiritual matters)... and even manages to be cranky in a way that makes me laugh. Perhaps as importantly, the book shows that Christianity may not be all about biblethumping -in the right hands it is a vibrant, contemporary, compassionate, and profound spiritual practice.  I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about mindfulness from a master teacher.	2002-06-06

De Mello went far beyond the orthodox catholic dogma by addressing what (to me) is one of the most important practical and existential issues facing us: how does one learn to live one's life with the bittersweet delightfulness that accompanies us when we manage to be present and aware. In other words, how do we learn to become a free person.  Typically, our awareness is clouded by others' expectations and by our desires to escape the perceived unpleasantness of the present moment. In order to free ourselves from the desires and escapism we need to be aware; de Mello's book is a classic (and still unsurpassed) manual that guides us into the conscious universe where we can finally heave a sigh of relief and start enjoying this great gift of life.	2002-06-05

His characters tend to remind me of marionettes, manipulated by invisible hands which deny them fulfillment of sentimental fantasies that drive most fiction and, in all honesty, drive most of us.  There is no unconditional love, there is no transcendental hope, there is no deus ex machina jumping out of a wooden contrapture to save hapless Kate, David and their kids. Instead, there is Life - the deliciousness of flailing in it and getting buoyed by it; the exquisiteness of not giving up yet accepting what is. In this way, Hornby reminds us of the essential nature of the human condition, its messiness and also the joy inherent in the messiness, when we allow it to permeate us deep into the bones.  It must be said that H. is a master of this genre, he is funny and he is ever so contemporary; although this book has perhaps slightly less momentum than his previous two, i still liked it and i am sure many others will too.	2002-05-22

By following the instructions step-by-step the practitioner  learns to generate an uninterrupted flow of chi through the major meridians and dan-tiens. Any dedicated practitioner of aikido, tai-chi, chi-kung, capoeira and other martial arts knows that this is not an easy thing to do - learning to manipulate chi takes years of practice and one has to be lucky to have instructors who are willing to impart this knowledge. Internal energy techniques used to be (and still are) rather secret in China and it is rare to encounter a Chinese master who is willing to teach these to non-Chinese disciples.  That's why we're lucky to have this book written by a Westerner for a Western audience.<br />Kumar starts from the beginning, with techniques designed to dissolve energy \\"knots\\". He then describes all the major points on the meridians where stale energy is wont to accumulate and introduces a simple Cloud Hands practice, which is an optimal way to open the shoulder blades and the pelvic girdle (stretch them darn psoas muscles!). He ends with teaching a simple spinal stretch method (which reminds me of Feldenkreis).<br />The book is filled with helpful hints and admonitions. It is also well written, unlike many other similar manuals which tend to suffer from mistranslations and bad grammer. Written text of course is no substitute for a live teacher, whose help is crucial so that we learn to correct the warped micro-postures and subconscious mis-alignements that tend to plague our  steps into the wonderful world of energy work. As a supplement, however, i think Kumar's book is very useful and i recommend it highly.	2002-04-09

Elizabeth Jenkins worked as an English teacher in Cuzco when she met a \\"fourth level\\" shaman, Juan Nunez, who showed her around Peru. Juan immediately initiated her into the fourth level herself.

About 20 times a year, Juan initiates yet another group of wide eyed tourists, and both E. and J. lead initiation workshops all over the world, including the US.<br />This book will be of interest to people who are inclined towards safe \\"spiritual adventures\\".

Is it possible to change our experience of ourselves and the world through dedicated practice - in other words, is it possible to become a happy person? Buddhism and other religions have always claimed this is possible if one dedicated oneself to a thorough investigation of one's own perception and cognition. Modern science approaches these questions from another end - it has succeeded in elucidating many of the key biological mechanisms which underlie brain function (such as attention, perception, cognition and dreaming). This book combines insights obtained from both endeavours and thus provides a welcome bridge between the meditation methods sharpened through thousands of years of practice and modern neuroscience.<br />The book is composed of four parts: (1) an intro on physiological effects of meditation is a thoughtful compilation of evidence gathered from (mostly) TM and zen meditators. Austin describes the changes in brain physiology (coherence in EEG activity, changes in oxygen consumption, breathing patterns), cognition (changes in perception, attention) and the long-range positive changes in attitude that occur in serious meditators; this part also includes a very competent overview of the effects of psychedelics on both brain activity and behaviour (2) a compendium of brain anatomy/physiology/chemistry which is a bit confusing and way too detailed. probably too simplistic for an expert and way too complicated for a layman; many findings described here are likely to be already out of date or to become so within the next couple of years. (3) a description of Buddhist and zen philosophy and practice which i find to be excellent (4) There are interesting accounts of Austin's own experiences during zen meditation - which include kensho (experience of \\"enlightenement\\"). i especially liked his speculations on the relationship between zen practice and personal growth. i found them useful because, as opposed to the recapitulation of other people's work, Austing here finally integrates the material via his own insights and experiences.<br /><br />In summary, I found this book to be worthwhile and interesting (if at times tedious). A wonderful thing about it is that it was written by an eminent neurologist and scientist (a Professor Emeritus, no less) who has immersed himself in an arduous and unflinching investigation of his personal experience of the world. This book thus represents an impressive bridge between quality science and quality zen practice and a welcome step towards integration of true phenomenology (meditation) and of open-minded empiricism. The week point of this book is its lack of organization:  Austin tends to add new stuff when he runs into it and he tends to do this rather haphazardly. As a result, the book lacks focus, things get repeated in different sections and there are large differences in the quality between the (158!) chapters. Still, these objections pale before the dedication  required to complete this project and the gifts we receive while partaking of it.\\"enlightenement\\"). i especially liked his speculations on the relationship between zen practice and personal growth. i found them useful because, as opposed to the recapitulation of other people's work, Austing here finally integrates the material via his own insights and experiences. <BR> <BR>In summary, I found this book to be worthwhile and interesting (if at times tedious).

Suzuki has managed to distill Dogen's message and present it in a way which is both grounding (one into the moment of reading) and inspiring (one to be ever more aware).  I have had this book for many years and it would probably have been the first choice for my Desert Island list.<br />I am very impressed by the subtlety with which Trudy Dixon managed preserved Suzuki's impishness and her skills in conveying to us his genuine, good and compassionate heart  as well as his unyielding dedication to practice.  This is no shouting, riddle-making and stick-wielding rinzai guy - no, in these pages we encounter a gentle, self-deprecating and deeply compasionate master who is teaching us the wisdom of being in the moment, and helping us to find beauty in simplicity and kindness.  There is a lot of dharma-power behind these words - Suzuki has been responsible for founding perhaps the largest and most successful zen community in the Western hemisphere.  Why?  because the sincerity and depth of his practice imbued unshakeable faith in zazen practice to anyone who met him, even for a moment. It will do the same for you. I strongly recommend this book .	2002-02-07

Damasio thinks he knows why. His idea is that the  mind cannot be conceived without some sort of embodiment (hence Descartes' Error). There is no Self which gives rise to a unified Mind; instead there are just so many synchronized systems of the body (the visceral, musculo-skeletal etc.) whose combined output results in a background &quot;feeling&quot;. It is that feeling which represents the self ; self can therefore also be defined as a  continuous experience of the body. During massage we relax the mind by relaxing the body .<br />According to Damasio, each movement (of the limbs or bowels) results in a specific &quot;feeling&quot; loaded into our subconsciousness. These feelings and associated emotions are at the very core of cognition. Indeed, this book is intended to prove to the lay public Damasio's belief that he has experimentally deconstructed the wittgensteinian/russelian illusion (which claims that formal logic will get us to the best available solution for any problem). On the contrary, D. found that certain patients whose emotional centers are disabled by stroke but whose logical abilities remain intact become functional invalides: they cannot decide and when they do, they tend to make wrong decisions (they cannot use their  &quot;gut feelings&quot; and therefore end duped or easily misled).  The integration of emotions and reasoning is orchestrated by the prefrontal cortex and a large part of the book is devoted to explaining the specific neural circuits dedicated to this task.<br />In my opinion, D. has not been able to prove Descartes was wrong.  It is obvious that our minds depend on (internal and external) sensory input to generate &quot;representations&quot; which ultimately result in &quot;decision-making&quot;; however, Plato would say that an absence of a functional brain region does not necesarily disprove the existence of  the Self - it merely prevents that Self from expressing itself.<br />The book has interesting and important things to say. I think, however, that it will be of limited use to an average reader. I often found it to be unnecessarily technical; moreover, unlike, say, Ramachandran's book, which is a veritable explosion of provoking ideas and speculations, Desartes' Error is basically about one single idea...  as a result, the same thing is repeated over and over again and i had to clench my canines to maintain interest.

VSR found that the experience of the phantom limb arises because the brain area which normally controls the (now amputated) limb gets invaded by neurons from neighbouring regions of the brain. Thus when the region formerly devoted to sensing the arm is invaded by neighbouring neurons which respond to face stimulation, the amputee feels his arm when he is stroked across the face. A striking example of such remapping was found in a man who experiences during sexual intercourse the orgasms in his phantom foot - since genitals are in the brain's body map right next to the foot, the nerve cells from the genital area take over the region formerly occupied by the \\"foot neurons\\" resulting in  migration of the orgasm into the phantom foot. This makes one wonder about the basis of foot fetishes in normal people....<br />There are many intriguing chapters on blindsight, the concept of \\"self\\" and the issue of qualia, so beloved of neurophilosphers. Where the book is at its strongest, however, is when R. draws directly on his clinical experience. He tells scores of amazing stories of patients with symptoms and syndromes which affected their perception, conceptualization, self-awareness and self-knowledge. This book succesfully shows us that conscious mind is simply a thin facade for the (mostly unconscious \\"self\\") - that there is a huge gray space between seeing and knowing, of which we are completely unaware.<br />One especially intriguing issue is that of religious experience. It has been long known that people with temporal lobe epilepsy often \\"find God\\". Temporal lobes of the brain are the interface between perception and action and what strikes R. is the closeness between emotional centers of the brain (such as the amygdala), centers devoted to memory (the hippocampus) and sensory areas of the temporal cortex. An epileptic fit might \\"kindle\\" - reinforce - connections between these brain areas so that communication between them would be increased and people would experience all events (as well as themselves) as imbued with deep significance. Everything in the universe would be seen as conscious and be \\"carried by a universal tide to the shores of Nirvana\\". In contrast, a patient with Cotard's syndrome feels so emotionally remote from the world that he will actually make the absurd claim that he is dead or that he can smell his flesh rotting. What this book provides us with, therefore, is an intimate peek into how fragile our reality constructs are and how grateful we should be to these few pounds of gelatinous flesh for the constant reality checks (and un-checks) that they provide us with.<br />There are other fine popular books by prominent brain scientists(Damasio, Churchland, LeDoux and Crick come to mind).

TWS has a lot to recommend it and since the good stuff has been pointed out in other reviews, i myself will ignore it here. Harner has, almost single handedly, ushered in the era of &quot;neo-shamanism&quot;. As i understand it, the basic idea behind neoshamism is to find a way to enter the &quot;altered state of consciousness (ASC)&quot; without having to use medicine plants. These plants are illegal, may be diffult to prepare correctly and are altogether too unpleasant to deal with. So, in comes the drum. And the rattle. The premise is that, somehow, using the same utensils as, say, Siberian shamans,  one is going to enter the same ASC. Nothing could be further from truth. In the absence of the mythological and spiritual context, the neoshamanic drums and rattles are toys for children.<br />The &quot;shamanic&quot; methods described in TWS were developed by Harner 30 years ago and have not changed one iota since then. All his imagination, creativity and inspiration seems to have vanished into thin air once he left UC Berkeley and now this guy keeps selling the same old stuff decade after decade. Academically! Seriously! Businesslike! TWS is Harner's Nicean Council - it has frozen his tracks.<br />The Way of Shaman gives us an aseptic, soul-less and (for me) ultimately boring way into the spirit world. Well, what *is* a shaman anyway? Is the mestizo in Iquitous peddling his ayahuasca a shaman? Is someone who finished her coursework at &quot;The Foundation for Shamanic Studies&quot; a shaman? For me, a shaman is someone whose task is to care for Life and whose role is to connect individual strands of consciousness to the large, universal and delicious Life consciousness. A good shaman is aware of the great Mystery and of the fact, that we are just players in it and why not go for the ride for the beauty of it. The (traditional) shaman is also plugged into the spiritual and mythic universe of his/her society and therefore connected to this mystery. We have lost this connection and are looking for it -  (neo)shamanism, if it is to survive, will have to provide it somehow, somewhere.  Right now, i think it is failing - one traditional Lakota lodge is worth ten courses taken at the Foundation for Shamanic Studies. In order to find one's power animal in the traditional society one does not just lie on the floo and daydream with the drum. Usually, much legwork is done and a lot of sweat/tears are shed; it can be dangereous and it takes a lot of patience, courage and ingenuity - all qualities necessary for serious work in ASC. One brings in the ancestors and the spirit world with reverence and respect. Harner ignores all this (most important stuff) and this is why this book is ultimately unsatisfying.beauty of it.

Following the pioneering explorations and speculations by his predecessors von Daeniken and Sitchin, Alford examines several  &quot;unexplained mysteries&quot; - from ancient Sumeria, pharaonic Egypt, Baalbek to Stonehenge, Nazca and Peru.  He points out the unlikelyhood that the monumental buildings, found at those sites, could have been constructed with simple Iron Age technologies. To support this thesis, A. provides interesting information, especially on less conventional research which tends to be omitted from the &quot;classical&quot; anthropological and historical work. I found his take on pharaonic records and Giza pyramids especially intriguing; moreover, Sitchin's work on Sumerians is given due credit .<br />While unfailingly interesting, the book has noticeable shortcomings. Alford's uncritical approach to published (and unpublished) literature is troublesome. He is quite happy to take a flimsy idea and present it as fact  while conveniently ignoring other contradictory evidence (especially if it is &quot;conventional&quot;). He is also prone to citing, in the same breath, data from reliable and accepted studies and highly speculative notions based on hunches and  zero  evidence.  Sitchin's work is accepted a bit too uncritically and with too much reverence which ultimately hobbles the book.  Thus, in his enthousiasm to prove the extraterrestrial connection, Alford tries to do too much and, for me, undermines the credibility of his main idea. Still,  if you are an aficionado of this genre, you will find a lot of food for thought. Which, ultimately, is what counts.	2002-01-09

Basically, the soul of each of us is given a unique daimon which slips into our bodies before we are born and then we pretty much spend the rest of our lives figuring out what the daimon wants from us. One way to do that is to pay close attention to our motivation, our urges for creative expression which reside in our feelings of uniqueness and grandeur and the restlesness of the heart. Another way is to pay close attention to the invisible world. Hillman is very helpful in drawing our attention to the many ways that the invisible can manifest itself through, such as the spirit of a place, the quality of a thing, the soul of a person, the mood of a scene, the style of an art, the goosebumps of a memory...The role of the daimon is to keep the invisibles attached (to the soul) and the spirits (the manifestations of the invisible) smiling and pleased. When the invisible forsakes your world and life is no longer backed by it, the daimon gets mad and the world tears you apart. This happens a lot in our culture.  &quot;Our modern passages are so narrow and with such low ceilings&quot; sez Hillman, &quot;that the invisibles must twist themsleves in freakish shapes in order to come through&quot;. How then does one bring the invisible forth? One way is by paying attention to intuition (which is our vessel for mythic perception), another by giving respect to our ancestors and our spirit friends and yet still another by cultivating beauty. Beauty has been defined by the neoplatonists as invisible presence in visible form and a divine enhancement of earthly things. According to JH, beauty is food for the soul.<br /> Since the daimon is closest to us when we are young, it is crucial to pay a lot of attention to harmonize one's child's life to beauty and to the ancestor spirits, which are concerned about  the welfare of the descendant's soul, through which they can see the world. How does one go about nurturing the child's soul? JH suggests 3 important elements: (1) parents must have a fantasy about the child (imagination is the language of the daimon) (2) there must be odd, eccentric fellows around the child and (3) obsessions must be given courtesy. The worst of all atmospheres for the daimon arises when your parents have no fantasy for you because they themselves have suppressed their own daimons and consequently, never grew up. As a result, the father capitulates to the child and we get &quot;a child dominated fatherless culture with dysfunctional children with pistol-packing power&quot;.<br />Although this book has many valuable passages, I have to confess that for me it was slightly disappointing - i think that it is not written according to standards we have come to expect from Hillman. The prose has an air of hastiness, incompleteness and (perish the thought) simpleness. most of the ideas have been already elaborated at length in other H.s books, such as the (splendid) Dream and the Underworld and the Psychology Revisited. On the good side, this book is probably less opaque than both aforementioned ones and may  represent a good way for the novice to enter the conversation with an erudite, deep and fascinating investigator of the human condition.about nurturing the child's soul?

On the good side, this book is probably less opaque than both aforementioned ones and may  represent a good way for the novice to enter the conversation with an erudite, deep and fascinating investigator of the human condition.	2001-12-28

The logos cannot address questions of ultimate meaning often leaving the mythos at the mercy of aggression and fear fueled by politics disguised as religion. Armstrong shows how the fundamentalists have managed to turn the mythos of their religion into logos by insisting their dogmas are scientifically true or by transforming a complex mythology into a simplified, consumer-ready ideology.  The notion that  &quot;my God is different from yours&quot; which is seen as patently false and  absurd by the mystic is nurtured by the fundamentalist in order to justify the defense of their community against real or perceived threats.  Armstrong shows us how the fundamentalist mindset found in all 3 major monotheistic religions has developed through time.  She discusses the sunni and shiite Moslems facing pressure by the colonial and ideological pressures from the British, Russians and (later) Americans and the Gush Emunim settlers trying to secure the land for settlements by importing hundreds of thousands of Jews into the West Bank with the aim to colonize all the strategic mountaintops. For them, a settlement was rationalized as &quot;tikkun&quot;, an act of restoration that would one day transform the world and thus  &quot;God's command to conquer the land was more important than the human and moral considerations of the national rights of the gentiles to our land&quot;; this in turn fueled a major radicalization of the Arab population. This also includes Protestants seeking to &quot;compel other men to walk in the right way&quot; (what kind of society did the Puritans try to establish in New England?  A democracy? Not on your life!) not to mention the Catholics who have used religion for centuries as an excuse to establish empires and suppress internal political dissensions and whose actions were going against explicit teachings laid out in the gospels.<br />This book  will be invaluable to anyone looking for an unbiased sourcebook on development of fundamentalism. In addition, it provides a lot of food for thought for anyone uncomfortable with societal pressures to conform one's inner life to an established &quot;creed&quot; , i.e., to subjugate one's logos to the communal mythos ... .an excuse to establish empires and suppress internal political dissensions and whose actions were going against explicit teachings laid out in the gospels. <br />This book  will be invaluable to anyone looking for an unbiased sourcebook on development of fundamentalism.

Rather, Andrews gives us a latter day version of Blavatsky's theosophy laced with an eclectic mix of Lakota, Aztec and pseudo-feminist self-improvement jabberwocky. Rather shameless, actually. I struggled to develop some sympathy for the supposedly autobiographic character, but it is so bland and so full of internal inconsistencies that i gave up. The most shocking thing about this book is the ruthlesness with which this mass consumption product is marketed towards women who seek spiritual guidance. To end on a more positive note, the books in the autobiographic genre that I would recommend include those by Timothy Knab, Martin Prechtel and Manuel Cordova-Rios. To women interested in starting their own shamanic practice I'd recommend Sandra Ingerman's Soul Retrieval.	2001-11-06

Like in today's New York, these people love and hate and yearn in blatant disregard of unwritten rules of conduct that separate the rulers and the ruled in the post-colonial world.  i simply love the delicateness with which Durrell writes about passion, about the unfolding of the senses, creative inspiration and about the soul. i love the humour that seeps through the pages and the uncanny way he captures the personalities of his protagonists. The people in this tetralogy have become my friends - Scobie, Clea, Nessim, Melissa, Darley, Pombal, Pursewarden ...  have taught me about living (and about dying).  In many ways, the tetralogy is very unpretentious - it is about ordinary lives of Alexandrians just before WWII. But how very extraordinary is the ordinary. How beautiful is the gradual unfolding of Darley's own character from the clutches of passion and lust and into the embrace of love. These books are about giving and taking, about  the mundane and the sacred, sweet and sour of life. And they are about nostalgia and yearning which take refuge in an open heart. I recommend them highly.	2001-10-24

Her main point is that each of them can be characterized by the tension between the mystical and the traditional, \\"fundamentalist\\" streams; that is, between those who have personally experienced God's love and those who use \\"God\\" to maintain their power vis a vis the Other (when the Other is represented by women or adherents to other religions). The book shows see how the religion, when ossified into dogma becomes an excuse for suppression of internal dissent and for armed conquest by power hungry fanatics blinded by Yahweh and his incarnations.<br />The power element in religious fundamentalism of all 3 faiths can be traced to one single event - the moment when Yahweh a tribal deity originally in charge of warfare, emancipated himself into The God. This resulted in banishment and persecution of the old religions which were based on appreciation of nature and its life-cycles and subjugation of the feminine. At that moment, the Mother archetype (I.e., Astarte) had been banished by the \\"Jealous God\\" and we get male chauvinist weapon whiping fanatics bent upon power struggle and victimization of the powerless. Very sad.<br />What I like most about Armstrong's book is how elegantly she ties all three religions together - she shows that the three faiths did not rvolve independently. In fact, the opposite is the case - here has been extensive cross-pollination in which ancient Greeks, Hebrews and Moslems influenced each other in theological and intellectual sense . In perhaps my favorite chapter A. describes how Mohammed took many key elements of the religion he was developing from the Medina Jews. Also fascinating was to read how the Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophers (such as Plotinus) influenced the islamic doctrine; and how ibn Rushd managed to unite aristotelian ideas with islamic ones. Subsequently, Muslim theologians had a tremendous influence on Christian and Jewish theologians such as Aquinas and Maimonides (which we conveniently seem to forget these days) and provided an important intellectual basis for the flowering of Renaissance.<br />It must be said that this book is not for everyone. To enjoy it one probably must have had an exposure to what these days is called \\"humanism\\". But if you have a keen interest in that murky intersection between religion, politics, philosophy and, (yes), mysticism, you will find an inexhaustible treasure of images, facts and ideas.

Love and work, who wouldn't want to resolve these two koans.  Joko Beck, in this book, gives us much more than a series of  little chickensoup feel-good stories about love and work. In what is essentially a compilation of her talks for sesshin students, she tries to goad us into what really cannot be expressed, cannot be talked about - into the awareness of the moment.  This book therefore cannot be *read*, it has to be *felt* with that mixture of gratitude, abandon, sensitivity and faith that one works on during the sesshin.  One therefore cannot use it to &quot;learn&quot; something about zen. As a tool for zen practice, however, i have found it over the years to be invaluable. i  come to this book again and again for inspiration and support -  i 'd rank it, together with S. Suzuki's Beginner's Mind as the best  book on zen practice available to us today.  What (arguably) makes it even more valuable to us are its syncretic elements: Everyday Zen  is written by a Westerner who sees her life from a perspective of an American, yet it also possesses the sensitivity to the workings of one's mind, the ferocity needed to face the mind's endless evasive maneouvers and a dedication to cultivation of awareness that matches that of any Japanese zen master, indeed, that of any spiritual master anywhere.  In short, if you want to practice zen as opposed to &quot;studying&quot; it, this is a book for you.	2001-10-14

The story of our people was like a song. As long as somebody could sing it, it was real. It never mattered if someone wrote it down. When you came you said our song wasn't real because it wasn't written down. Then you wrote it down the way you wanted it. Our history was alive. But your history was dead, even though it was written in words. &quot;<br />  This is an honest and open-hearted book which aims at giving us the Native American perspective on the relationship between the whites and the reds.  The anger, the bitternes and the incomprehension which the Indians have for  the white man's robot-like obsession with possessing land (how could land, a living organism, be possessed?) and acquiring goods are depicted touchingly via a series of conversations between the author and an old Lakota man.  The book is skilfully written and has many humorous passages. It is easily readable but for me it was not an easy read.  It is hard to be reminded of the extent to which the Lakota (and other N.A. peoples) were physically, morally and culturally  battered and, almost, vanquished by an almost inhuman, greed of the invaders.  The desperation, with which they have watched their animal &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; disappear.  It made me very sad. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding the N.A. point of view  and who wants to take a breather from the deluge of  books on N.A. &quot;spirituality&quot;, which paradoxically, tend to perpetuate the separation between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;.  If you want to learn about respect, listening and generosity, read this story, listen to its songs.	2001-10-02

Readers, interested in shamanism will find many gems... such as description of  methods used for \\"stalking\\", cultivating the awareness with which one can track, and call to oneself, animals. One gets to marvel at the multi-dimensional properties of the Mayan language, with its different layers reserved for properly initiated youths, adults, elders and shamans - a language, where meaning is deeply embedded into the invisible landscape of spiritual forces which have shaped the history of the Tzutujil. Atitlan is a place, where those forces are still alive, because they are fed by constant acknowledgement based on gratitude and fear and, especially, beauty. The spirits are fed by beauty, says Prechtel, and by grounding our lives in the awareness of beauty surrounding us we support the benevolent unfolding of the universe.  With the aid of this book one also gets to understand the importance of the ancestors and the importance of community for the Maya.Prechtel is also very poignant in describing the revolting habit of X-ian \\"missionaries\\"  who are bent on destroying precious and age old connections between indigenous cultures and their environment.  Don't these people have better things to do?	2001-10-02

Catherine David, in this sublime book, investigates the space that is behind the physical movement, behind the conscious mind, at the very core of what constitutes our sense of the Self - that space which gives birth to our sense of beauty and which can be translated through innumerable ways (including the Tai-Chi exercises and piano playing) into wordly manifestations of our uniqueness. In this space imagination and sensation are interlocked, like lovers. Once we realize that Self is just a metaphor and that the mental image can be the impulse to opening of a technical skill , we hold the keys to true freedom. In this society in which the essential is generally considered incidental (which is reflected in the unberable dullness of the contemporary man), Catherine David picks the essence from inconspicuous corners where it has been gathering dust and shows us how she uses it to unlock the gates leading to inner beauty. By doing this she helps us glimpse and perhaps touch that space. This book is a rare treat.	2001-09-13

The story is told by a master raconteur who introduces us to two wily and remarkable teachers of the old ways, Inocente and Rubia.  In a masterful sweep of the history of a small town in the Sierra de Puebla  we get to see their roles in the havoc caused by the tension between the indigenous peasants and the mestizo rulers in which the former's only defense were the ancient techniques of  &quot;snuffing the candles of the unjust&quot;. K's prose allows the reader to revel in the evocative beauty of Nahuatl and it evokes one's respect and affection for the people he is writing about (in short, this is anthropology at its best). I recommend the book to people interested in exploring the thin line between the real and the imaginary, reality and dreams, and to those who like to witness how the new world and the old world can meet in the spirit of respect, strength and mutual enrichment.	2001-09-09

Had FAW been a really good theoretical or experimental physicist, or an impressive shaman, this work might have been a monumental achievement. Unfortunately, here we have a small time college physics teacher dabbling amateurishly with medicine work and - unsurprisingly - getting &quot;insights&quot; which never transcend the banal first-derivative of the simplistic analogy. This book is sentimental to boot and self-indulgent to the point of exhaustion and the unfortunate cayote reader can only growl with irritation at the lack of philosophical rigor combined with the shallowness of the author's autobiographical profile. I am sure Fred is quite a likeable guy and he appears to have dabbled in enough fields to gain some notoriety in New Age circles chasing a New Unified Theory of Everything.

He is knowledgeable, passionate about his interests, he is entertaining and also bitchy, which adds the requisite spice to the chicken soup we call Buddhism in the West. This book contains a collection of essays with a common thread based on Hayes' insistence on ethics and moral responsibility, his focus on what it means to be a true friend and, above all, his belief in the role of reason in the spiritual process (belief which itself borders on obsession). There isn't a transcendental bone in Hayes' body - witness sentences like: &quot;... i strongly believe (sic!) that the only basis upon which civilization can be built is the foundation of reason. It is my belief that the only means by which we become superhuman is to abandon all thought of supernatural and the transcendental and to focus all our attention and energy on the concrete and particular problems of that which we can observe and understand in this world&quot;. This Descartian-Jeffersonian Yankee pragmatism does not have all that much in common with the little Buddhism I know, but nevertheless is a welcome respite from the touchy feely &quot;Marin School of Buddhism for the Very Rich&quot; of the likes of Kornfield and Boorstein and it provides a good defense against rascally tricksters like Trungpa, Tendzin and the many zen masters. Unfortunately, part of this &quot;ethical Buddhism&quot; also involves a rather dogmatic rejection of sexuality (sex, according to H prevents us from being friends) and every other non-mind-based mode of expression of life, which would make H's Buddhism a bit boring and bland (not to mention that it is an oxymoron, since wanting to live one's life by following the dictates of one's reason only is definitely highly irrational). The book, i must stress however, is not boring at all - far from it. H. argues his case well and many paragraphs are pure gems. One of my favorites is the essay on Dr. BR Ambedkar, a brilliant law scholar who helped the untouchables in India to rebel against the perniciousness of the brahmanic system of social control - the caste. The Buddha himself pointed out that all divisions into race, caste, social class, religious group, language group etc. are unnatural and man-made and that trying to live on the basis of such divisions is a lie which has disastrous consequences for the humanity. This is the part of Buddhism that interests Hayes and it is here that we should explore with him what it means to live sensibly and with dignity.
