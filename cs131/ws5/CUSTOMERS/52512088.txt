This one, however, seemed fairly uninspired to me. Lots of cute pages of cute toddlers doing cute toddler things -- but nothing that really sparked my creativity for scrapping the hundreds of photos that I have of my own cute toddler.<br />A general scrapbooking book would probably take you just as far as this book would.	2002-10-01

For one thing, I'm usually the one BEHIND the camera.

However, I am inspired to ALSO make some theme albums. Plus, her philosophy is very liberating and many of her ideas are exciting. Stacy assures the reader that we don't have to work chronologically. She encourages us to make a small album of our favorite pictures.<br />I needed to make a gift album as a going-away present for a colleague. Following Stacy's guidance in this wonderful book made the project do-able in the short time that I had to get it done.

I have to say that this one was disappointing. Still a page-turner, but disappointing.<br />Hard Eight is not as laugh out loud funny as previous outings. Evanovich moved away from some of the old reliable elements in this book -- the massive destruction of cars, visits to the funeral home, Grandma Mazur -- but what she gives us instead is simply not as funny.<br />The plot -- never a really strong point in these books -- seems particularly thrown together here. And, it seems that Evanovich loses interest in it just as we have and the book just stops. Tantalizing possibilities are not pursued.<br />The characters feel sketched in this book, as if Evanovich is counting on what we know from previous books and is counting on us to fill in the outlines.<br />The whole thing just seems flat.<br />This is a great series. Start at the beginning and enjoy the ride.<br />I'm looking forward to the 9th book.	2002-07-14

Just when I thought that I just wasn't very good at coping with toddlerhood, I ordered and read this book. Thank you, Vicki and other Girlfriends! Everything going on at my house is normal, normal, normal. As the author puts it, trying to raise a toddler is &quot;like trying to put a collar on a bumblebee.&quot;<br />This book is funny, encouraging, helpful -- filled with anecdotes about other moms and other toddlers (some bound to be more frustrating than yours).

Then, Don't Bother	I'm an enthusiastic scrapbooker and an eager reader, so a book about scrapbooking is impossible for me to resist. So, when I found this book on Amazon and saw the great reviews, I ordered it with high expectations.<br />Well, friends, those high expectations were disappointed. This book reads like an extended infomercial for Creative Memories. If you've been to a CM home class, you've heard the basic spiel -- this is just a (much, much) longer version.<br />It's not that I don't agree with the CM message. I think that making albums is extremely satisfying and worthwhile. AND, I agree that it's important not to get overly caught up in the \\"craft\\" to the detriment of preserving your memories.<br />It's just that this book didn't really give me anything new.<br />If you aren't already a scrapbooker and need some encouragement to start your albums, this might just be the book for you.	2002-05-16

Beth O'Malley's book explained how and why it is different and provided excellent guidance on creating this very special gift for the adopted child.<br />With the guidance of this book, I'm now working away at my daughter's lifebook. <br />This book can guide you whether your adoption was international or domestic, an infant adoption or an older child, a child who was in foster care . . . Whatever the circumstances, Beth O'Malley has guidance and advice for how to handle it in the lifebook.<br />If you are an adoptive parent, I urge you to get this book and get to work on this important part of preserving and transmitting your beloved child's story.	2002-05-07

The wordplay and the humor are such fun for our primary grade age son and for the parents, too. I find that the poems have insinuated themselves into my brain without my even trying to memorize them -- but I consider that to be a good thing, because these poems are such fun. My son finds &quot;Boom&quot; -- the poem and the illustration -- to be scary and we usually have to skip that one. His favorites are the one about the nasty little dragon and the dragon in my computer; my favorite is the title poem.<br />I must say, however, that the dragons in the illustrations are not at all the way I picture them, so I found the illustrations disappointing.	2001-09-23

I was quickly pulled into a historical period of which I know next to nothing -- 17th century Holland. Chevalier's descriptions are richly detailed, her characters seem real and engaging.

What seems, at first, to be a simple story about an underachieving daughter growing up in a household with a distracted mother and a distant father who dotes on the older son becomes, in fact, a complex and philosophical novel about family, religion, language, and perfection. This is not conventional storytelling. It is engrossing and thought-provoking. Sad and frustrating in the way that dysfunctional families can be. I look forward to future novels by Goldberg.	2001-09-23

These parents talk about their shock, their grief, their struggle, their pride, their success. This book helpfully includes a variety of types of disabilities and stories about children ages infant through adult. Several of the parents talk about school inclusion -- an extremely important topic for parents of kids with special needs.<br />One quibble that I have with this book is the frequent emphasis on parent-to-parent support. I believe that, while this is extremely helpful to some parents, it is not necessarily universally helpful.<br />If you're a parent of a child with special needs, I believe that this book will speak to you. If you are a teacher -- of any kind, at any level -- PLEASE read this book and gain new insight into the experiences of parents of children with special needs.	2001-09-10

But you do forget. Or you're so overwhelmed you don't know what to write. Or . . .<br />This journal is an easy size for packing for travel. It gives good sentence stems to prompt journaling -- without being too prescriptive (I don't like being bossed around by books). It is nicely organized into sections to do with the trip, the places, arriving  home, etc.<br />At least 3 of us in my travel group were carrying this journal. If you're going to make an international trip to adopt, you need this book. Get it!	2001-08-19

Therefore, I own lots and lots of &quot;name your baby&quot; books. For naming your Jewish baby, this book is the best! The list of names is extensive with lots of uncommon (here in the States) choices. The book provides the Hebrew spelling as well as the English spelling. There also is a rating system showing the name's popularity in the U.S. and in Israel. If you're looking for a name for your Jewish baby and you want to go beyond the usual Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, Rachel, Jacob, etc., you need this book!	2001-07-01

They feel they've learned many things that they did not know before. I am hopeful that this book also will be useful and interesting to my daughter as she grows.<br />I particularly appreciate the sensitivity with which the book presents the Chinese culture and tbe reason that most of the children adopted from China are girls. The other wonderful thing about this book is that it is packed with photos of everyday China and of adopting families in China.<br />If Chinese adoption has touched your family, I encourage you to add this book to your collection!	2001-07-01

I was not disappointed. Although this book is about many things (the author's own experiences with the Chinese adoption process, for instance), the most truly valuable aspect of the book is the insight it gives into the Chinese political and cultural situation that has led to the current child abandonment situation. Evans presents a culturally sensitive explanation of the history and the culture. This book has helped me answer many of the questions that I frequently am asked about Chinese adoption. I'm considering buying several copies to give to family and friends.	2000-11-29

The reason, I think, is the essential true-ness of this portrait of women friends and what they mean to one another. (And, of course, it helps that I can identify with the Graces -- their age, their challenges.) I recognized some of my own women friends in the stories of these four women. This is what I'd normally call a great &quot;beach book,&quot; but you don't need to wait until summer (despite the picture of the beach chairs on the cover) to pick up this book and get involved with the Saving Graces.	2000-10-11

Paley  knows full well that children are not perfect -- she writes brilliantly  about rejection in &quot;You Can't Say You Can't Play&quot; and addresses  these issues in others of her books as well. This is an important book  BECAUSE it is so commonplace to hear &quot;children can be cruel&quot; as  if that is all that they can be.<br />That said, this is NOT Paley's best  book. Having retired from teaching, she no longer has the day to day  experience of the classroom to write about. I find those books richer.	2000-09-08

Its relevance goes far beyond the kindergarten classroom, which is the  setting of Paley's story. The book speaks profoundly of rejection and its  consequences -- and proposes a solution (&quot;you can't say . . .&quot;).  If you care about children, if you remember being rejected or left out  yourself, read this powerful book.	2000-09-05

This is a magnificent addition to the Harry Potter series -- full of magic and humor and memorable characters and adventure. As you've no doubt heard, this IS a darker book than the  previous three, but it is still filled with fun as well. Too much has been  made in the press of &quot;Harry discovers girls&quot; and &quot;a  character dies.&quot; These are not the major focus of the book.<br />Don't  let the hype cause you to jump into the Harry Potter series here.

There is much here to enjoy. Ultimately, however, I found the book disappointing. I saw where the book was going long before it got there. I found the main  character (and narrator) frustrating in her lack of insight and her poor  judgment. Unlike &quot;The Good Mother&quot; where it was easy to see how  the main character got into the predicament she ended up in, Jo's  predicament seemed very avoidable.<br />While I was reading this book, a woman  came up to me and asked me how I liked it. It seems that a friend of hers  was finding it difficult to get into.
