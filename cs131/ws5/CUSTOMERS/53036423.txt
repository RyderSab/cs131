US	53036423	R1NXAF7X9KFPT9	0441011799	701127178	Singularity Sky	Books	2	6	9	N	Y	Babble Babble Boring	I didn't truly appreciate the other reviews here until I read this book.  It isn't just \\"some\\" techno-babble is is \\"mostly\\" babble.  I couldn't believe that how much useless jargon filled this novel.  Literally, three or four pages to have the captain say \\"full speed ahead.\\"<br /><br />Also, there are a number of \\"terms\\" that are used that I could not find a definition for that matched the context, and given the semi-bizarre story to begin with it made it very hard to read.  It started with a \\"Curator\\" of a \\"Basilisk\\".  There were \\"melting clocks\\" and many other terms that I was unable to resolve.  Maybe I'm just dense but the only term that matched the context was the melting clocks and that seems to have been referenced in some ST:TNG episode or something.<br /><br />When you have a novel with strange ideas and lots of bizarre imagery like attacking mimes, walking huts, and more the reader should be given some sort of anchor to reality in order to process what is being read.  That doesn't happen in this novel and the result is a very tedious and long read.<br /><br />I found myself skimming through babble trying to find the point where the stopped and the actual story continued.<br /><br />The story is basically; planet A is \\"invaded\\" by aliens and central government sends fleet to A to stop it.  On board are two people from planet C with different form of government with hidden agenda.  Fleet is too stupid to know what to expect.<br /><br />The characters don't have very much depth and I was constantly needing to refer back to earlier chapters to remember who they were (they were than bland).<br /><br />If you really want to read page after page of how the starship turns on it's engines you'll love this.  If you want a story with good characters and interesting plot lines you will probably be disappointed.	2005-09-27
US	53036423	R2LQ06C65INBFF	0743412346	209608496	Sir Apropos of Nothing	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	A delightful surprise	For various reasons I have consistently avoided this book.  However, with my choice of reading material being scarce of late (for equally various reasons) I decided to pick this one up and have a go at it.  I must say that after finishing this novel I was kicking myself for not reading it earlier.  This is a wonderful story about not only an anti-hero but of a young man growing up without a real family and in the end learning right from wrong.<br /><br />Sounds sappy?  Well, it isn't.  This is a masterfully told story with plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor.  Told by Apropos himself we see learn his inner feeling and desires.  The tale has you laughing one minute and rooting for Apropos the next.  Almost all the other characters have something they are hiding and end the end the story comes full circle and leaves you with a sad, but...apropos...ending.<br /><br />If by chance you avoided this novel because it was 'yet another fantasy story' (like I thought at one point) I think you'll be pleased upon reading it.  I have ready plenty of stories that try to either be just like Tolkien or completely opposite, but always being compared in one way or another to those master tomes.  Not this one, it is it's own creation and the author has full confidence in his own creation.<br /><br />I whole-heatedly recommend this novel.	2005-09-09

The final ending is not original.  There have been several \\"looping\\" books where then end is the beginning.  Yes, the Crimson King turns out to be a pointless character.  Yes, the ka-tet is broken in anti-climatic ways.  Yes, the story is too long for what is told.  Yes, the death of Flagg is both nauseating and dumb.<br /><br />So what is left?  A silly ending that is at least better than having it all been a dream, or Roland climbing to the top and dislodging a piece of dirt from some godlike machine.  It could have been even worse than it was.<br /><br />The problem is that for six books we have been led towards this tower than controls the destiny of everything only to find it is nothing more than a mobius tube.  Not only anti-climatic but much much less than what King could have made it.  He had a chance to fill our minds with wonder as we ascended into the heart of the Universe or creation itself.  This could have been his best piece of literature if he had opened his mind to present a concept of how that universe was held together.  I think that is what he always intended but in the end didn't trust himself enough to finish the story the right way or feared being ridiculed for his vision of an all powerful tower/god that he punted.<br /><br />If you've read the other six of course you have to read this one as well.  Just don't expect much.  To paraphrase T. S. Eliot...\\"this is the way the story ends, not with a bang but a whimper.\\"	2005-07-19

From the excerpts I read of this book, I am amazed that any credible publisher would sell it.  The rabid folks who hounded the Clintons for the past decade will love it, but for those who actually graduated high school you will soon find you are reading something that would otherwise only be seen in a grocery store tabloid.  In fact, I wonder if there is the same disclaimer in this tome (\\"it's all just a joke\\").<br /><br />I have become more and more disenchanted with American politics as it has fallen further and further into a sordid mess of who can lie the loudest and project the most media friendly lies.  For the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would want to enter politics today.  It's not just one party either, it is the whole of American politics.<br /><br />You know what?  I'll vote for the person who makes the most reasonable policy suggestions.  It doesn't matter to me if it's the Son of Sam because books like this have demonized every politician to the point that I wouldn't know if any of the attacks on Sam were true or not!	2005-06-21

I had picked it up at a book sale at work hoping it would be at least readable.  Well, it was and much much more.  This is a wonderful witty tale with characters that are fun and interesting.<br /><br />Mr. Arthur Penn, candidate for Mayor of New York, has the BEST gun control policy I've read.  He has the BEST way to get young people to vote.  I would vote for the politician of any party who came out and responded to the first debate question the way he did.  INCREDIBLE.<br /><br />This novel is part comedy, part political commentary.  It says what I have thought for a long time; if a politican were completely honest he would be quite popular.<br /><br />This book is fun, and a page turner.  I highly recommend it.	2005-06-12

It isn't very interesting, for example, to read about Uhura going to ask a archeologist to join the mission.<br /><br />The main body of the story is interesting but manages to side-step the issue of what the probe's true intent was.  An \\"intent\\" is given but we never learn why the creators of this probe are so interested in it's study.<br /><br />A minor annoyance to me was how many times Spock says \\"Doctor\\" in the story.  He says \\"yes doctor\\" about 3,000 times I think.<br /><br />The relationships between Kirk and Hiran are interesting and it would have been better if more of the story had centered on that and what Hiran's true feelings and goals were.  I found him an interesting character and would have liked to have him delved into more.<br /><br />Ex Machina is a much better post-movie Trek novel.  This one is ok, with valid characterization and a satisfactory story but it lacks something in the end.	2005-05-13

I'm sorry, but in the series Angel wasn't in every episode (thankfully) but he has been in both novels and it's just irritating.<br /><br />Thrird, The mystery is solvable about midway through because of a flub in what the killer says.  I'm not even sure it was intended because it is never mentioned at the end...but it is there.  It made the second half of the novel rather tedious.<br /><br />So what is the verdict?  It's ok, not great.  The other Rockford novel by Kaminsky is better.  This one is more legwork without the classic intertwining of seemingly unimportant events that was classical in Rockford.<br /><br />Since there are few options for Rockford fans I would recommend reading it, but don't expect it to blow you away.	2005-05-02

It introduces depth to our beloved characters, and introspection.  We see the characters grow, and develop.  Sulu grapples with his career direction.  McCoy wonders if he is a has been.  Spock must deal with his new found need for emotion.  Kirk must deal with his image as a \\"hero\\" and at the same time seek peace with his method of assuming command of the Enterprise.  All this and more await the reader.<br /><br />The story is in itself a simple Trek story.  Instead of using some \\"end of the universe\\" plot it is simply a Trek drama with all the things that made Trek so good.  It is timely, dealing with terrorism, education reform, and tolerance.<br /><br />All aspects are weaved together into a beautifully told story.  The author clearly has a love for Trek and his characterizations are perfect.  Best of all, the ending does not disappoint.<br /><br />I'm tough on Trek novels.  Most of them are throw away, and tolerable at best.  This is one of the best and a joy to read.	2005-04-04

I think every character has a \\"don't call me Shirley\\" moment and it is annoying to say the least.  But, I am a huge fan of New Frontiers and anything is better than nothing.  Indeed, the scene involving Calhoun in the council chamber is incredible (I'll say no more to avoid spoilage).<br /><br />My overall impression is that this novella was rushed out and doesn't represent the quality we have come to expect from Mr. David.  Yet, even in this short, comic stretch it is good to see our New Frontier friends.<br /><br />A side note.  The letter to the readers at the beginning was very strange.  Essentially, Mr. David lectured the reader that these are his characters and he would do what he pleases with them.  That is part of my basis for thinking this was not a novella that was ready for publication.  Very strange.	2005-03-11

The problem with this novel is mainly it is simply describing a battle.  Although this is understandable since the book is based on a wargame, it still distracts from what should be the main characters.  I found I could just skim over several pages at a time because they just were a play-by-play of this battle.<br /><br />Also, the characters are shallow and it hurts the story.  It isn't that the characters aren't interesting or without flaws, it's more that they aren't developed.<br /><br />Finally, the story isn't really any different from the first novel.  Sure, the situation is different but the plot isn't.  It made for a long, boring read.<br /><br />If you are into game-based books you might like it.  I'm generally not, and I didn't.	2005-02-08

The story doesn't really take off until the very end which is what saved it from a 2 star rating.<br /><br />The problem is it the characters aren't interesting.  They are shallow toons in a game world, and that is how they feel in the book.  More characterization would have been greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Overall, it was ok and was just good enough to get me to read the next book in the series (but probably not to read all three).  Normally, I read a book a week but this one took me 2+ weeks because I just wasn't excited about the story.	2005-02-01

The ending of the main story is interesting, but the secondary \\"flashback\\" story is simply dropped.  It is odd when you read something for a couple of hundred pages and then it just disappears.  Very strange...like something is missing.  I can't say much more without needlessly giving away too much information.<br /><br />The character of Picard is treated poorly.  He comes off as a somewhat scared, play by the rules flunky to Kirk's \\"damn the torpedo\\" persona.  Both characters are represented poorly.  This continues the later Shatner novel characterizations which is unfortunate since the first novels were so good.<br /><br />On the positive, the main story is vaguely interesting if you are willing to put up with yet another \\"murder mystery\\" Trek novel.<br /><br />In the end, the novel was an ok read but nothing to right a review about...oh wait, too late.	2005-02-01

It is a mixture of three episodes and as presents a little deja vu to the reader.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story has not suspense because the reader knows what is happening as soon as the landing party beams onboard the Enterprise (TM, SM, (c), etc).  When you have nothing suspenseful or no surprises to wait for one starts to pay more attention to nit-picking, and here are some that annoyed me.<br /><br />1.  Apparently, the ship has a photographer who uses film plates.  Maybe the ship was actually the Love Boat....<br /><br />2.  Sentient beings are categorized as such by whether they have farms.<br /><br />3.  Mr. Scott has a southern accent when agitated.<br /><br />There are more, but they would spoil the story.  The point is, the story isn't horrible it just is a bit boring and predictable.<br /><br />Try some New Frontier novels instead.	2004-12-21
US	53036423	ROWSGH0SHWJJ9	044024126X	743256516	Taken	Books	1	1	1	N	N	Bad Ending, Cardboard Characters	This is a typical Sci-Fi network style story.  Long on words, short on story.  Essentially, the book is about a group of people who repeatedly are taken by aliens and chased by the evil mean military.  This continues, and is repeated for several hundred pages and then ends.<br /><br />I do mean ends, nothing is resolved and the story just stops.  I found myself examining the book to see if there were missing pages; there were not.<br /><br />I haven't seen the mini-series and now I wouldn't if I had the opportunity.<br /><br />If you feel like reading it, just read the first and last chapter.  What is in between is just more of the same but with different cardboard characters.<br /><br />Bad.	2004-11-15

Here is an example.  Early on the ship is disabled, computer inoperative, captain in a coma and dying, no star drive, and stuck in enemy territory.  The first officers dilemma?  Can he assume command because the computer isn't online to validate it.  So, in this world it doesn't matter that the situation is dire or not...you must fill out the proper paperwork!  What makes it even odder is how this \\"dilemma\\" is handled later.<br /><br />The transitions between chapters is a bit abrupt and doesn't flow either.  In one chapter the main character is combative and depressed.  Next chapter he is organizing a party.<br /><br />Another problem is that the main character is never described.  That is, we don't know if he is black, white, red, or pink.  Is he short, tall, human, or squid?  The author goes into boring detail on what the ship looks like but nothing on the main character.<br /><br />Of course there is another problem; the characters are all cardboard and have the typical clich&eacute;'s throughout the story but no depth.<br /><br />The main problem though is that the story is three acts and only one act really matters.  The first act just drags on and the second act adds to the silly concepts of the first.  The final act isn't too bad, and hence this reviewer gives the story 2 stars instead of one.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's not worth reading, but don't expect must entertainment value.	2004-10-15

An excellent documentary was done by NBC and broadcast on MSNBC about all this.<br /><br />As for the book, so much of it had been refuted in the 70's that what remains is just campaign slurs and accusations.  Most credible sources have already determined that most of the assertions here are false, or at best half-truths.  Republican Senator John McCain called it \\"dishonest and dishonorable.\\"<br /><br />In all fairness, I only read about 1/3 of the book.  I couldn't stomach it after that.  It is very offensive and insulting.<br /><br />The final analysis is this:  if you hate John Kerry already, and you just want to read trash without concern for facts then this is for you.  If you are interested in learning about John Kerry then I would search for a book that hasn't been totally discredited.	2004-08-17

That is the first thing one should understand if one chooses to read this book.  It would barely qualify as a procedural in my opinion.  The problems are many.  First, the main character isn't described at all untill 3/4 of the way into the book and then the only feature I was able to discover is that he has blond hair.  Second, the main guy runs around a lot and has a lot of apparently great meals but that is all.  He solves nothing, it is all solved for him.  The only &quot;murder&quot; is solved in a way that would be kind of like playing a guessing game and at the end someone saying &quot;oh it was number 13.&quot;  without you even trying to guess.  Needless to say, I was terribly dissapointed.	2004-06-10

It's the characterization that was the more annoying.  At one point Kirk says &quot;Oh jeez, I need to contact the Enterprise.&quot;  Oh jeez?  How many times did Kirk say &quot;oh jeez&quot;?<br />I also had a bit of a problem with the way McCoy is portrayed in command.  I won't go into it and potentially ruin it, but suffice it to say I didn't realize his talents (at least according to the novel).<br />So, if you want an ok Trek novel with really annoying characterization and dialogue this one is fine.  Again, not bad but I couldn't quite get past what I would classify as the &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot; form of Kirk, and some of the other main characters too.	2004-06-03

I have really enjoyed all these books, but this book may be the best yet.  The story alternates between Mackenzie and Shelby during their academy days and the investigation of Lt. Gleau's death on the USS Trident.<br />The academy days were outstanding, not only do we find out how Mackenzie met Shelby, but we also find out why Jellico dislikes him, and how Calhoun handles the Kobayashi Maru test.<br />I was hesitant about this novel because I dislike Star Trek &quot;detective&quot; stories.  Fortunately, this isn't the case (at least not mainly).  Instead the story flows naturally and ends with an ending...not a cliffhanger.<br />In fact, the only small item that irritated me was a couple of lines said by Ambassador Spock that included a bit too much colloquialism.<br />This is a excellent novel, and it should be a movie.  Better yet, Peter David could revitalize Star Trek series from the Voyager and Enterprise disasters.	2004-03-03

If anything I was surprised by how positive it treated the church based on my previous reading of The DaVinci Code.<br />One issue is how similar the flow of the story is to the previously mentioned work.  I found myself making comparisons all along the way.  Da Vinci is definitely a better novel.<br />I really have to wonder about gravity after reading this novel...and that's all I'll say about that.<br />Overall, a good read but don't do like I did and read it right after reading Da Vinci Code or you'll have too much d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.	2004-02-19

Everyone is doing involved in something that is 'their last best chance' at something.  There is a trial by combat, the annoying ambassador, the alien misunderstanding.  It's all been done before, only better.<br />I thought it would be interesting to read a novel about Sulu as a captain, but in this one he is simply a cardboard cutout who smiles or grins at everything.  No characterization worth reading.<br />Also, the story is told in third-person 'removed'.  The only way to appreciate this annoyance is to watch an episode of the PBS kids show Calliou before reading this book.  In the cartoon the narrator says things like &quot;Calliou didn't want to take his medicine, but he didn't want to feel bad either.&quot;  This is exactly how this novel is written.  You don't read the story directly as it happens, no, you read a narration of the story (e.g. &quot;Sulu didn't want to go to do something, but he felt he had to.&quot;)  I felt like I was reading a book written for grade schoolers.<br />The big problem, however, is the stories logic and flow.  At one point Sulu 'figures out' who the aliens are.  How does he do this?  Who knows, the narrator doesn't really explain but somehow he puts a couple of obscure facts together and amazes the reader with a warp-leap of logic.  The whole story is like this, and it disappoints greatly.<br />In a nutshell, you feel like you are reading a loose translation of a story outline without actually being allowed to get into the story.  Sulu does smile though.<br />Read any of the Shatner Trek novels, or New Frontiers novels for a much more enjoyable reading experience.	2004-01-18

Filled with adolescent fantasies of orgies, drug use, and no character development.  After the first &quot;section&quot; the story does start to mesh some.  The main problem is the logic presented for human changes over the centuries just doesn't seem realistic.  In the end I felt very much like I had read a 60s pulp sci-fi story.

Not a big problem but after several hundred pages it became annoying.<br />The story is ok, nothing special, more like a TV movie.  The real problem is the timing.  On one page Cannell says it is 8:30am and a bright crisp day and on the next page it is pitch black with dark clouds covering the moon.  Later the evil folk outrun a train, on foot, and through mountains.<br />So, if you can get past the moving and timing then the story is passable.  Not award winning, but with some character changes it could have been an A-Team episode.	2003-10-14

Having just finished the impressive Virnor Vinge novels I was anxious to continue my trek of great Science Fiction.<br />Hyperion is not a novel.  That is the first thing a potential reader should realize.  It is a collection of six short stories, each of which has an ending that requires the main character to meet a bug-eyed-multi-armed-time-traveling monster on the planet Hyperion.  As a plotting ploy this is great, most of the characters have interesting stories to tell and you end up waiting impatiently to see what happens when they meet the monster.<br />They don't.  I don't feel I'm spoiling the ending, because there is none.  The entire set of stories ends with the &quot;pilgrims&quot; stepping foot on the monsters temple.  Absolutely nothing is resolved in this novel.  It isn't a question of disliking the ending, it is a question of where is the ending?  Some might call it a cliffhanger, I would just call it a waste of time.<br />Having wasted too much time on this novel I cannot justify spending more money on the sequel.  I have not guarentee that it will resolve anything or just be another setup to sell more books.<br />I'm disgusted that this &quot;novel&quot; is considered a Hugo winner in the company of such wonderful novels like &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; and &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot;.	2003-10-05
US	53036423	R2NWCISTSNTM4F	0525947647	857217799	Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them	Books	5	79	102	N	N	A must read, but a question	Al Franken is back in form with a better book than \\"Rush Dimbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot.\\"  Franken takes a wealth of knowledge provided to him by \\"teamFranken\\" (a group of 14 researchers at Harvard) and wields a tale of that should anger anyone who reads it.  It should not matter which side of the political aisle you are on; if you are a Democrat you should be outraged at how so many lies have been made against your party.  If you are a republican you should be outraged at how your pundits poorly researched their claims, and instead resorted to \\"fact by repetition\\".<br /><br />An example from the book; Ann Coulter used as an example of 'liberal' media the fact that Evan Thomas' father, Norm Thomas,  ran for President as a socialist four times.  Evan Thomas is bureau chief for Newsweek.  Franken uses this lie to hilariously discredit Coulter.  You see, it turns out that Norm Thomas isn't Evan's father at all.  To add insult to injury it turns out that Norm Thomas ran for President six times not four.<br /><br />Now my question.  Given the breadth of deception, lies, and hypocricy demonstrated by the right's pundits I find myself wondering why there hasn't been a major investigation into the whole deal?  Is it just so expansive that there is too much to take on, or is it (as Franken would say) that the mainstream media is just too lazy?<br /><br />Overall, a great read that had me laughing out loud more than a few times.	2003-09-08

It is also the story of the inhabitants of that star system; a species of spiders just emerging into a technological age.<br />Once again Vinge spins the details of an alien culture with such precision and detail that they become real to the reader.<br />I'm pretty hard of novels, I tend to easily become annoyed with poor writing, grammar, and plot.  So, when I give a novel 5 stars, IMHO it REALLY deserves it.  Very satisfying, very deserving of its Hugo Award.	2003-08-05

Such is the case with this novel.  The reader is subjected to such hilarious comedy such as \\"Q, go stand in that queue.\\"  Makes one want to double over with laughter.<br />Most serious, the story is told by Q but there are so many metaphors that are strictly human that the reader is unable to maintain any \\"suspension of disbelief.\\"  More often than not the reader is stopped cold wondering why Q would be making comments about \\"needles in haystacks.\\"  The worst was a half-chapter devoted to the letter \\"Q\\".  Q discusses the symmetry of the letter...apparently the reader is suppose to accept that the Q-continuum uses human English as its designated alphabet, or that by some fluke the letter is the same from human to Q.<br />Yet another annoyance was the cardboard cutout characters.  Picard's entire role in this novel is to yell at Q about how smug he is.  The universe is collapsing and this Picard is worried about whether Q is \\"belittling\\" him.  One would think that such pettiness would be best saved for, say, when the universe isn't collapsing.<br />There are two good points I can make for this novel:<br />1) It is an excellent example of why writers should be very careful when choosing to write in first person narrative.  The use of first person here hinders the story and is very annoying after the first few chapters.<br />2) If the author had removed about 200 pages there would have been a pretty good idea for a novel.<br />If interested in reading about Q, try \\"Q-Squared\\" instead.	2003-07-09

After reading about half of this novel I decided that I must be the most treasonist person in the world.  Afterall, I voted for democrats!

The author jumps into the story without setup, and you are left wandering what the heck he's talking about.  Then it blossoms into a beautiful story full of depth and character.  Sweeping, grand, and brilliant.  I can not say enough how much I enjoyed this novel.  My only quibble is the ending; not that it was bad, but I had hoped from something more tension packed.  As it stands, it was a good ending but not great.<br />When I bought the novel I had some worry that the story would be about the &quot;kids&quot; saving the day, like some TV tripe.  I was glad to learn that the kids are treated as kids with real frailties and nature.  If you read the description of this book and think that this will be some &quot;superkids&quot; book you would be wrong.  They play a major part of the story but they are believable and endearing.<br />Having said that, I whole-heartedly recommend this novel.  It was VERY deserving of the Hugo award.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-06-16

As a continuation of the chararcter Dan Randolf, I was really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, the book really becomes nothing more than Randolf running around begging for money.  I also think the book is missing any kind of real climax, it's really a setup for the next novel in the series (I assume).<br />I thought &quot;Colony&quot; was an awesome saga.  &quot;The Precipice&quot; is aweful soggy.	2003-06-04

The author tries way to hard to make everything a metaphor.  Everything is &quot;xyz was like a blah blah blah.&quot;  It was very distracting from an otherwise boring book.<br />This is a time travel to change history story.  I'm sure everyone has read a dozen.  I'd be happy to never read another.<br />The main problem with this book isn't the plot, the silly metaphor's, or even the slow boring pacing; it's the fact that nothing really happens until the last two chapters.  The rest of the book is, in my opinion, just filler to create a novel out of a short story.<br />Here is my reccomendation, find a Peter David novel instead.	2003-05-29

Republican right should read this book too.  Not only read it but analyze the facts and then try to determine if the over zealous groups are really what the republicans wished to stand for.<br />I was absolutely glued to this book.  With every chapter I marveled at how little I knew about what the facts surround the Clinton's were.  Absolutely astonishing.	2003-05-08

It didn't have the same drive or passion that the other books had. The ending was a letdown primarily because we know how it ends, and nothing new or dramatic was offered at the end.  In the techno-mage series we see a fantastic ending that encompasses the series as well and that is what I had hoped for here.<br />I'm also very picky about redundancy in books.  This one talks about the calluses on the hands of some of the characters to the point of being silly, and was very distracting.<br />Overall it is ok, nothing special, but not terrible either.	2003-05-07
US	53036423	R2593996ARVRQI	0743467523	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Surprisingly good	This novel starts out slow, and at first is written in present tense making it difficult to read and follow.  However, after the first chapter it really picks up and becomes an entaining story that kept me reading to the very end.<br />I have never read much Stephen King because I really don't care for his writing style, so I can only compare this with the few other novels of his that I've read.  To me this one is up there with &quot;The Stand&quot;.  Not as all encompassing, this is a tighter story centering on five friends and how they become intertwined with each other and an alien encounter.<br />The only dissapointment was the ending.  Its not a bad ending, but as I approached it I was hoping for something a bit more grand.  Minor quibble, and doesn't distract from a very satisfying read.	2003-04-28

The actual story doesn't begin until three-quarters of the way through the book.  In the meantime we are exposed to the crew of the ship and their harrowing adventures, such as deciding whether to eat tuna salad or salmon.<br />One character is a xeno-racist, but apparently so are many others since they laugh at the antics of the racist.<br />The entire book is cardboard characters and mindless scenes.  One of my favorite authors, Ben Bova, wrote a book about writing Science Fiction.  In that book he states that an author needs to begin a story with some conflict to catch the readers attention.  This book waits until chapter 16 to do anything.  The only reason I kept reading is because I lost [money] on it.<br />Summary:  A blank journal provides a better story.	2002-12-08

I had hoped for much better.  It also failed one of my major criteria for a novel; it was never edited.  At various points throughout the book Sulu is refered to as the navigator or helmsman.  On particular scene has Uhura, seeing Chekov look at her, ponder about the navigator.  The very next paragraph she is now ponder about the navigator (Sulu).  Very annoying.  In order to make this book more enjoyable I found myself visualizing very colorful &quot;sign language&quot; by various character.  Sign language plays an important part in the story.<br />Overall, I was very disappointed in this book.	2002-12-05

Not this one though. This novel is childish, boring, and poorly written. The story opens with a completely laughable idea; a number of planets have acquired virus' on their database. Apparently, in the authors minds these planets have only one database and never make backups. So the plot starts off dealing with the natives upset at the Federation for downloading virus' and causing them to loose all their history &amp; data. Stupid. Now the main part of the story deals with what the authors call a &quot;mobile&quot;. Actually, its a big rock with some sort of intelligence.<br />The writing is childish, with conversations sounding like it belongs on Disney. Also, the author's use the word &quot;murmur&quot; everywhere. No one really says anything in this book, they murmur it.<br />I would recommend murmuring over to a Peter David novel, or some of the surprisingly good William Shatner Star Trek novels.<br />Don't waste your dime on this murmur.	2001-10-15

Unfortunately, the end of the book left a sour taste in my mouth.  The ending fizzled without resolving the question that the author insisted on restating on every page, &quot;is there a god.&quot;  Although the book was well written (even though the last two chapters look like they were missed by the editor) once I finished I found myself not pondering the existance of a God, but why it took so many pages to say nothing.<br />I have to say that the author has an enjoyable writing style and a good sense of humor...but the ending knocked all the stars out of my review.	2001-09-06
