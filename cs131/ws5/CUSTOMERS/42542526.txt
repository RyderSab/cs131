In one of his last books, Samael Aun Weor endevours to explain the origin of the human being contrary to materialistic science including Darwin's and Heckel's theories. He also talks about evolution, devolution, and occult history, with most of his findings coming from the Akashic records.<br /><br />He brings up many interesting statistics, ideas, stories, and facts and his language is far bolder than one might expect as he is up against the entire \\"scientific\\" community!<br /><br />This book is a necessary complement to Rudolf Steiner's related book entitled \\"Cosmic Memory\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended for inquisitive minds!	2005-08-01

If you ever wanted a serious and reputable book on the Chakras, then look no further because Leadbeater's classic book covers everything you need to know fundamentally about them.<br /><br />He not only talks about the chakras, but also about the different energies of man, the subtle bodies, the multi-dimensional universe etc.  His findings are completely Hindu based, with the various contributions from Theosophy, Buddhism and medieval Christianity, all interwoven with pictures, diagrams and charts.<br /><br />Oh! How extremely vital it is for modern society to know the hidden system of man's anatomy!<br /><br />This book is a perfect and necessary complement to Samael Aun Weor's  great book \\"Endocrinology and Criminology\\", which examines the chakras from a scientific/philosophic standpoint and how they relate to the endocrine system, nervous systems and the many aspects of human psychology.<br /><br />Forget about all the \\"New Age\\" pseudo-info on spiritual issues and matters and remember the true pioneers of the Occult like Blavatsky, Steiner, Heindel, Manly P.

What he looked into was the memory of nature otherwise known as the \\"Akasic Records\\".  He did this with a superior faculty in the brain related to sight called \\"clairvoyance\\".<br /><br />He tells us of The Polar race, The Hyperborean race, The Lemurian race, The Atlantian race and the Post-Atlantian races (us today).He also talks about spiritual beings that have helped in the creation of the world and in the movements of the planetary races.<br /><br />The last section of the book deals with those who wish to find out more about the spiritual worlds and what they need to do to train themselves to reach higher states and develop superior faculties latent within.<br /><br />This book is a marvel.  It will benefit scientists very well to know about this book and it content.<br /><br />And there are others that have talked about occult history, for example Madamme Blavatsky in her 2nd Volume of The Secret Doctrine called Anthropogenesis, Max Heindel in his book The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception, and Samael Aun Weor in his books: Gnostic Anthropology, The Revolution of Beelzebub, and The Revolution of the Dialectic.<br /><br />If you are serious about knowing Who We Are, Where We Are Coming From and Where We Are Going then this book will help you realize those things that have been a gigantic mystery and a terrible plague on modern minds for generations!	2005-01-27

We examine it in the Astral World. The book \\"The Revolution of Beelzebub\\" is a book of the Goddess Nature and we have it on the Altars of our Temples/Sanctuaries...<br /><br />\\"He was an astonishing man, he knew the entire book! He spoke about Nirvana, of a Golden City in the Nirvanic world...<br /><br />\\"They (the Arhuacos) are one hundred percent practical, and their way of studying my books was through meditation.  As they did not know how to read and write, they did it through meditation. They did not have their intellectual center ruined...\\"  -(see [...] for the full lecture under \\"seriousness in the work\\").<br /><br />The book is written in an extremely clear, precise and direct way, so as not to let anyone be misunderstood, while keeping the cosmic grandeur and narrative and poetic style.<br /><br />It includes an index, diagrams and beautiful illustrations by Gustav Dore.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone wishing to expand their occult knowledge, discernment and awareness in the midst of false prophets.<br /><br />CHAPTERS INCLUDE:<br />1) The Revolution of Beelzebub<br />2) The Arcadia<br />3) White Magic and Black Magic<br />4) The Two Ways<br />5) The Staff of the Patriarchs<br />6) I Accuse<br />7) The Atom Nous, The Solar Period<br />8) The Mind and the Intuition<br />9) The Lunar Period<br />10) The Terrestrial Period<br />11) Lemuria<br />12) The War in Heaven<br />13) Atlantis<br />14) Black Magic of the Atlantians<br />15) Nirvana<br />16) The Elixer of Long Life<br />17) Beelzebub and his Revolution<br />18) The Millenniumbook is written in an extremely clear, precise and direct way, so as not to let anyone be misunderstood, while keeping the cosmic grandeur and narrative and poetic style.<br /><br />It includes an index, diagrams and beautiful illustrations by Gustav Dore.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone wishing to expand their occult knowledge, discernment and awareness in the midst of false prophets.<br /><br />CHAPTERS INCLUDE:<br />1) The Revolution of Beelzebub<br />2) The Arcadia<br />3) White Magic and Black Magic<br />4) The Two Ways<br />5) The Staff of the Patriarchs<br />6) I Accuse<br />7) The Atom Nous, The Solar Period<br />8) The Mind and the Intuition<br />9) The Lunar Period<br />10) The Terrestrial Period<br />11) Lemuria<br />12) The War in Heaven<br />13) Atlantis<br />14) Black Magic of the Atlantians<br />15) Nirvana<br />16) The Elixer of Long Life<br />17) Beelzebub and his Revolution<br />18) The Millennium	2004-06-01
