I picked it up from a gift shop there as I went round visiting the sites of Fr Damien's enormous and extensive ministry. I also heard from the tour guides, stories of the zeal and dedication with which he ministered to the ill-fated leprosy patients. I also knew about him from other sources.<br /><br />The book is a wonderful read. It brings to the light of the world a rather obscure life of a Catholic priest who belonged to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts Fathers and worked in the mission of Hawaii. His devotion and dedication to the ministry in favor of the lepers and his eventual martyrdom as a leper seemed to have moved this non-Catholic writer to go into detailed research and strenuous investigation to bring out such a classic work on the subject. Gavan Daws does not idealize Fr Damien's life or make him a superman. According to him Fr Damien was an ordinary man, a priest with his own frailties and flaws, at the same time a hero and a martyr worthy to be  called `holy.'  The book in fact, is more than a mere biography of the leper priest. A lot of research and study has gone into the writing of this book which is a story of leprosy in the Hawaiian islands, a history of the Church in the second half of the nineteenth century, besides being the life of a saint-to-be. I hope that the book will inspire ordinary people to make deep personal commitments and fulfill them with extraordinary devotion and fervor.	2005-06-24

Analyzing the crisis and the circumstances that led to it, Wiegel exposes the culture of dissent and self-deception among the seminarians, priests and ultimately among bishops who failed in their ministry of shepherding the flocks. Greater fidelity is the proper response to this crisis and just like any other crisis, this too must be turned into an opportunity. Therefore he lays out a blueprint for a genuine reform of the Catholic Church in America.<br />One may or may not agree with all the opinions, arguments and conclusions of Wiegel; but the book surely provides a mine of information and a wealth of wonderful insights.	2004-05-15

All her talks contained stories from her own life, which she told with passion and fervor.  In her informal conversations with her sisters, visitors and guests she always used stories very effectively. These were always short, clear and to the point.

They conveyed profound truths about human life and our relationship with the Divine.<br /> This small book contains 109 such stories told by Mother Teresa. They have been compiled and edited by Edward Le Joly and Jaya Chaliha.

They are typically Indian in their style and content, dealing with characters like kings, princesses, aristocrats and Brahmins along with vampires, demigods and courtesans. The events narrated happen in kingdoms specified and places known to the Indians. The narratives are particularly interesting with elaborate descriptions and detailed characterizations. Each story contains a lesson and a moral.  These are drawn mainly from two ancient Sanskrit collections of stories, which themselves are adaptations of a lost work named 'Brhatkatha', the writing of which itself is another interesting tale narrated in the 'Introduction'. These stories concern the northern India, dealing with an age from the first until the seventh century A.D.<br />J A B van Buitenen who was professor and chairman of the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Chicago has translated these stories from Sanskrit and presented them without any embellishments or updating.  That makes the original style and fantasy of these tales available to the reader. These stories provide a good taste of Indian narrative literature of old to the inquisitive Western reader.

I was on vacation in India for a month and I visited a niece of mine. While talking to her I heard the chanting of Bhajans from the neighborhood and I inquired as to what was going on. She reported that in the neighborhood was a house where the devotees of Mata Amritanandamayi gathered every week and prayed to her in front of a framed photograph of hers. I was curious and went in to ascertain it. There were about 50 men and women seated in front of her picture, chanting hymns. It was an eye-opening experience for me. Earlier in the week, I had passed through the front of the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Cochin and had heard from many about the facilities over there. Now, I decided to learn more about this person considered a saint in India.<br />Reading through this book helped me to situate the phenomenon of Mata Amritanandamayi. No doubt the book is trying to depict in an objective light this charismatic woman, Amma (Mother) as she is understood and looked upon by thousands of her devotees. As a miracle healer, prophet and mystic she has established her fame.  Her world tours have attracted attention to herself as an incarnation of the Divine Mother.  By now she has grown into a big institution worthy of attention by the world. Judith Cornell by this book is presenting her along with her ideas and gifts to the western world. She tries to bring in personages familiar to the American readers, like Padre Pio, Bede Griffiths and C G Jung in relating to the ideas and message of this Hindu saint.  She also refers to the black Madonna and the Christian understanding of Virgin Mary the Mother of God. The Catholic and Orthodox Christian belief in the Blessed Mother is very different from the concept of the Divine feminine found in Hinduism, though there are some comparisons possible.  What Cornell ends up doing is to bring the East and West closer. The story of the rise of Sudhamani, an ordinary girl from the family of a poor fishermen couple on the coast of Kollam, India to the world renowned Mata Amritanandamayi is fascinating. Her story is told as it is known and spoken of around her birthplace, by her family members and her devotees around the world.  Her ideas are presented in simple words, understandable to the ordinary folks, though they are typically Hindu in their perspective. The Hindu pantheon could absorb any number of seers and sages as incarnations of the Divine.  So there are repeated mentions of Buddha and Jesus Christ in the book.<br />I found this a valuable book, useful for anyone who wants to know more about the saints and sages of the land of India. It gives one a somewhat objective look at the phenomenon of Mata Amritanandamayi along with her humble past, her mystic experiences and her compassion for the poor; it provides one the opportunity to hear the various opinions of many of her devotees deeply touched by her. All these contribute to the immense popularity of this saint of today, whose activities in favor of the poor are widely recognized.llam, India to the world renowned Mata Amritanandamayi is fascinating.

'Jasmine' captures the attention of an average American reader for its captivating subject matter as well as the engrossing style.  It is the poignant story of Jyoti the daughter of a Hindu family in Hasnapur in Punjab, India, a family driven out of Lahore during the partition of India-Pakistan in 1947, who ends up in the farm lands of Iowa at the age of 24 along with a banker in wheelchair much older than herself and an adopted Vietnamese boy. Bharati Mukherjee through her characteristic prose narrates the moving tale of this courageous woman who, resigned to her fate foretold by an astrologer in India, journeys through life with determination as the young wife of a promising engineer in Jallundar, an illegal immigrant in Fowlers Key, FL, a maidservant in Flushing, NY, the 'day-mummy' for a little girl in Manhattan and the 'wife' of a banker in Elsa County, Iowa. For the sake of survival Jyoti the village girl of Hasnapur successively transforms herself into Jasmine, Jase and Jane.  A misguided young follower of Bhidranwalle in Punjab and the 'Half-Face' in Florida take the roles of the villains.  Mukherjee's superb writing skills with great sensitivity to the tensions and thrills experienced by an immigrant from India makes this book a fascinating reading.	2002-02-21

This hardcover edition of 1994, published by Barnes and Noble, is the most recent English translation of Fr Omer Englebert's 'Lives of the Saints'.  It gives accurate profiles of more than 2300 men and women canonized by the Catholic Church. Nearly a thousand who have left their mark on history are given short biographical accounts. The others have a sentence or two in order to situate each of them. They are all organized month by month according to the liturgical calendar of the Church.  This book was originally compiled and published in the 1950s receiving its 'imprimatur' on 20th February 1951. The present edition is not updated or revised. Therefore it does not take into consideration the many revisions of the liturgical calendar afterwards, which have rearranged some feast dates for a few saints and reordered the importance of a few in the liturgical calendar. In the last half of a century numerous new saints have been added to the list, who have not found their way into this book. So it is a little outdated and cannot be used along with the present Church calendar. But it remains a good source book for students interested in the saints of the Church. A very useful index at the end is especially noteworthy.	2002-02-19

This short book provides answers to a few fundamental questions about the Jesus Prayer as to what it is and why it continues to appeal to Christians both in the East and the West. The book not only furnishes some historical information but guides one to a special love for this form of prayer which is sure to lead one to Jesus Christ. Ever since its appearance some fifty years ago, this book has remained somewhat a 'minor classic' of spiritual life.<br />The author, self-styled as \\"The monk of the Eastern Church\\" or 'Archimandrite Lev Gillet' is somewhat an enigmatic personality whose life and search for truth are rather elaborately dealt in the 'Forward' by Bishop Kallistos Ware of Diokleia. This Forward is very helpful in situating the importance of this book. Being a theological study, the book contains some theological terms as well as a few words in Greek and in Latin.	2002-02-18

Here is an authoritative account of the inspiring life and extraordinary achievements of that frail and ordinary looking little woman named Mother Teresa, written by a friend and admirer from India, who does not even share her faith. Navin Chawla is a senior civil servant working with the government of India, who came into contact with Mother Teresa and was inspired by her to take up the cause of those affected by leprosy, about which he has written another book. This book is the fruit of his hard labor of five years which consisted of various personal conversations with his subject herself and numerous visits to the Missionaries of Charity in Calcutta and elsewhere. He traveled to different continents to visit the innumerable friends and helpers of Mother Teresa in order to gather direct information. He had access to the various letters, records and documents of the Missionaries of Charity through one of the senior members of the congregation specially designated for the purpose by the Mother herself.<br />He narrates the story of this Catholic nun and Nobel Prize winner with great sensitivity and intuitiveness, never idealizing his subject nor belittling her magnificence. He manifests a clear grasp of the details of the government of the Church and the faith of Mother Teresa though as a Hindu these were foreign to him. He focuses very much on the work of the Mother in order to describe her personality and convictions thereby heeding to her repeated calls \\"write about the work\\". The distressing recollections of the children in the Shishu Bhawan, like those of Bapi and Dadda, the tales of woe heard from Balu, Jehangir and many others at the Leprosy Centre and the poignant glimpses of the dying men and women at Kalighat are indeed moving. Mr. Chawla writes with ease and elegance, required for the biography of a person of her stature, intending it for an international audience. This is the best biography of hers written by an Indian who knew her well personally.	2002-02-16

The first two parts deal with the subjects of 'God' and 'The Other'. The editors draw from the words of Mother Teresa found in Malcolm Muggeridge's 'Something Beautiful for God' and an earlier work of theirs called 'Amour sans Frontiere'. In these sections the words of Mother Teresa are interspersed with some commentary by the editors. The part III has extracts from Mother Teresa's letters to her sisters and part IV is a commentary on the constitution of the Missionaries of Charity by Mother Teresa. All these counsels reflect a simple and consistently earnest and zealous person filled with the love of God. She has a clear and direct style and no one can miss the fire in her heart. It is a valuable source book to know this modern saint more closely and to draw inspiration from her.<br />This is the kind of book that is useful for meditation and reflection. Its companion books \\"A Gift for God\\" and \\"Life in the Spirit\\" by the same publishers, are equally inspiring.	2002-02-11

He portrays the life of the working class men and women of the city of Bombay in its rawness.  The story revolves round the protagonist Vishnu, a derelict drunk, who lay dying on the ground floor landing of the stairs of an apartment house.  The interaction among the Pathaks, Asranis, Jalals and Tanejas  who live in the same apartment house  and their unusual responses to the dying Vishnu,  create a host of complex situations through which Suri paints a beautiful picture of urban life for the average Indian. Padmini, Vishnu's beloved from the prostitute house, Kavitha the daughter of the Asranis, and Sheetal the deceased wife of Vinod are also memorable characters. The portrayals of even the less significant characters are unusually credible; short Ganga, Salim, Shyamu etc.<br />The novelist does not have any agenda of his own except to depict the life of the ordinary people with its heavy influence of Bollywood movie personalities like Raj Kapoor, Meena Kumari and Mohammed Rafi and religion with its accompanying mythology, godmen and swamijis and a host of superstitious observances and beliefs.  The narrative is humorous, witty and at the same time sensuous and touching.  The Bombay-born Suri walks us through the city of Bombay with its Marine Drive, Gateway of India, Hanging Gardens and Victoria Terminus. In order to help the understanding of the foreign reader he also gives a glossary of Bombay-words.  It is a delightful novel giving a fairly flawless picture of life in this large Indian city.	2002-02-07

This book affords perspective and focus to the varied aspects of this ministry of leading people in worship through song. Practical issues that confront the musician are here discussed; some of them an experienced musician would already know, some would give new insights and some others would provide a fresher approach.<br />The musician as a leader of worship has an enormous responsibility of leading the worshippers in prayer, which he shares with the other ministers.  The different aspects of working with the pastor and possible difficulties are also discussed. If all the ministers kept in mind the fundamental principle that they work together for the people of God, tensions could be avoided.  The contents of the book are relevant for anyone who is working at the act of worship in our churches including pastors, choir directors, organists, cantors, choir members etc.  The scope of this book goes beyond any particular denomination. Any minister of a Christian church would find this book relevant, useful and interesting.

This is one of the richest and at the same time simplest ancient prayers of Christian tradition. Though it was extensively used in the East, it was overlooked by large sections of the church of the West until the middle of the 20th century. The Jesus Prayer has a rich history of two thousand years'  &quot;wandering through Palestine, Sinai, Athos and Russia&quot;. Peoples' experiences with this prayer through the centuries have been written down and these were brought together in the 18th century under one title,  &quot;Philokalia&quot; (love of the beautiful).<br />Per-Olof Sjogren the Dean of Gothenburg Cathedral in Sweden, who has over 20 books on prayer and liturgy to his credit, introduces the Jesus Prayer to the Western world. He quotes frequently from the 'Philokalia' and draws from the contemporary situations of the Christians in order to argue that this is specially suited for busy people because of its brevity. A lot of what is said about the Jesus Prayer is true of prayer in general and he is scriptural as well as practical in his approach. This book with very good insights on prayer also could be used for fruitful spiritual reading.	2002-02-03

As I began to explore this book of his that idea began to give way to a sensible and skilled writer, irrefutable in his arguments and unrelenting in his battle for the cause he finds right and worth fighting for. He has a message for the world even though most of us would neither like it nor pause to hear it. No one can deny that the culture of death has taken hold of the West. It is not a prediction or a prophecy, but a fact. I felt sorry for the vilified author, but as I progressed through the pages of the book the reason began to dawn on me.<br />Buchanan is bold in lashing out against the revolution, the secular humanism and many other contemporary forces responsible for the decadence in the society.  His boldness sometimes goes to the level of arrogance and intolerance and therefore his conclusions risk being dismissed summarily.  He is against abortion, euthanasia, pornography and homosexual unions and these seem to be at the root of the present ailment of the Western culture. But when he also prefers to stand against immigration, one-person one-vote democracy, other cultures and other faiths, rousing up a counterrevolutionary spirit, he seems to loose the very battle. In his tirade against anything other than Western and American, he declares, \\"Western civilization and culture are superior\\" (p 246). Here the dividing line between his ideology and that of the fascists becomes almost invisible. Interestingly enough he repeatedly complains that conservatives like him are termed 'racists, fascists and Nazis'. No wonder.<br />America is a great nation and the coveted nobility of this nation is not the result of the work of narrow-minded extremists like Buchanan but the broadmindedness, liberalism and tolerance of the founding fathers.  He professes Catholic faith and quotes pope John Paul II profusely and tries to defend the legacy of Pious XII. But his negativity and pessimism along with the antagonistic and intolerant attitude towards other religions and cultures is foreign to the Catholic faith. Heed the call of Paul the apostle, \\"Be joyful in hope, persevere in hardship, keep praying regularly, share with God's holy people who are in need, look for opportunities to be hospitable.\\" (Rom 12:12-13)his negativity and pessimism along with the antagonistic and intolerant attitude towards other religions and cultures is foreign to the Catholic faith.

I received a copy of this book as a Christmas gift from the archbishop and at the next opportunity I thanked him in person. He encouraged me again to read it, saying, &quot;The chapter on preaching is particularly inspiring.&quot; In order to fulfil my promise to him I sat down with the book.  In spite of the short sentences, small paragraphs and the everyday language, it was not that easy a reading.<br />The book successfully brings out the need for our spirituality to be nourished and sustained regularly by the celebration of the Liturgy. One needs to be present at the Eucharist with one's receptivity and in touch with one's own brokenness.  Liturgy is a golden event in which imagination has to play a vital role but the experience of the believer is indeed real.  This book is helpful to the faithful to internalize the Gospel spirituality celebrated in the Eucharist.

It evokes irony, humor and sympathy at the human condition. Saramago is one of the greatest writers of our generation with an extraordinary vision and an incredible imagination.<br />The story opens with a man driving his car, stopped at the traffic light, suddenly struck totally blind.  Within a day those associated with him, his wife, the eye doctor and the taxi driver are all blinded. The epidemic spreads and the government in panic quarantines the victims into an abandoned mental asylum.  In this crowded asylum of blind people, soon the organized systems break down and social conventions crumble, paving way to selfishness and cruelty among the internees. The 'doctor's wife' who had a pair of seeing eyes, helps to report the filth, dread, sex and violence amidst the lawless pandemonium of these wards. Eventually seven internees get away from the wards under her leadership, with the asylum burning down behind them.  Soon, they realize that the entire city had gone blind. Walking through the haunted city they hunt for food and search for shelter. The total breakdown of the systems of the society eventually reduces them to living like nomads moving from one place to the other among the utter devastation of the city.  The agonizing life of the blind men and women of the city with all its filth and horror thus unfolds before the reader until a few of them regain their sight and return to normal life.<br />The events happen in an unnamed city, in an unknown land. None of the characters are mentioned by name.  The chapters of the book are neither numbered, nor named. The lengthy paragraphs of prose with minimum of punctuation and no quotation marks pose real challenge to the reader. Though these make the reading cumbersome and understanding strenuous, they help the reader to experience the gropings and stumblings of the characters in the chaotic city of the blind. No wonder, the book successfully transports one into the world of blindness sharing the emotions and feelings of the characters.  This thought-provoking book should help one to discover the blindness in each one of us.  It also would help one to face squarely and boldly the dread created by the confusion and disorientation of the modern civilization.haotic city of the blind.

He deals with the questions and concerns that an ordinary Catholic may have about inter-religious dialogue. He gives clear and precise answers to the possible questions and doubts, providing valuable practical guidelines. His honesty, simplicity and clarity of expression make this book an important tool for those engaged in inter-religious dialogue. He is emphatic about the need for mutual respect and understanding among the religions and about the commitment of the Catholic Church to the cause of inter-religious dialogue.<br />Francis Cardinal Arinze, born and brought up in Nigeria was ordained a priest in 1958 and was appointed Archbishop of Onitsha, Nigeria in 1967.

The prayer taught by Jesus Christ has been a model and source of inspiration for thousands of men and women throughout the centuries.  It is often thought to be a Gospel in a nutshell, providing a wealth of insights for the one who meaningfully employs it in prayer.<br />Cardinal Simonis, the Archbishop of Utrecht in this current volume reflects on the meaning of the Lord's Prayer for the faithful of today.  In the first chapter he reflects on prayer in general and then turns to analyze each petition of the 'Our Father'  in the subsequent chapters, carefully considering its theological and spiritual implications for the one who prays. As a pastor of peoples, he is deeply aware of the issues and concerns of the Christian at prayer.  He endeavors to explain the spiritual and theological principles with clarity and depth.  Thus he draws from the various witnesses of Christian tradition as well as the scriptures in order to elucidate the meaning of each petition. The simplicity and depth of his own personality becomes apparent through these pages, providing a model of prayer life for the faithful.  The book also gives interspersed through its pages, texts of prayers and inspiring poems by men and women who have found consolation in prayer. It is indeed an inspiring book to be read for spiritual benefit by any believer in Jesus Christ.	2001-11-19

As a historical novel it is a valuable contribution to Christian literature by this Japanese theologian and novelist. No wonder, he is often compared to Graham Greene.<br />Sebastian Rodrigues, a Catholic priest of the Jesuit Order, the protagonist of the novel arrives in Japan with his confrere Francisco Garrpe during the persecution of Inoue the magistrate of Nagasaki, in order to help the Japanese Christians in their struggle and also to find out the truth about the apostate priest Ferreira whom they knew to be zealous for the Christian faith. Landing in the suburbs of Nagasaki they find their hiding place on a mountain with the help of the villagers. Soon the persecutors enter the village and they have to flee. Before long, falling into the hands of the persecutors, Garrpe joins the many martyrs in death and Rodrigues goes through the intense struggle of watching the sufferings of the Christians in his confinement. While undergoing the physical hardships of the prison, he has to deal with the mental agony caused by the absolute silence of God in the midst of the sufferings of His people. The insufferable mental torments like the voices from those in 'the pit' and the contacts with Ferreira bring Rodrigues to step on the 'fumie' and become another apostate. Sebastian Rodrigues of Endo was in real life Guiseppe Chiara who died some forty years after his apostasy, stating that he was still a Christian.<br />Endo's perspectives on the western garb of Christianity preached in Japan and the land of Japan as a swamp sucking up all sorts of ideologies only to transform and distort them in the process, are fascinating. The popularity of Endo's novel proves that Japan is not indifferent to Christianity but awaits a form of Christianity that will suit its national character. This book is a masterpiece dealing with faith and suffering; it should be recommended to any serious-minded Christian for spiritual nourishment.ith and suffering; it should be recommended to any serious-minded Christian for spiritual nourishment.	2001-11-11

Within a few years of his election to the Papacy, his apostolic zeal took him to every continent with the Christian message of joy and hope. This book, &quot;A Pilgrim Pope&quot;, is a collection of the Pope's messages given out to peoples of various cultures during the course of his travels beginning in Poland in 1979, up to Romania in 1999. Cardinal Achille Silvestrini who was the Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, has edited this collection, giving a valuable introduction to each message from the point of view of the context and the relevance of the message. But the message itself is in the form of excerpts from the Pope's speeches. Cardinal Pio Laghi has written a forward to this collection.  This book, as a whole captures the man and mission of this pilgrim Pope.	2001-11-06

As a political liberator his name shall ever be remembered in history, but it is his contribution to the humanity's inner life that would prove more important in the long run. According to him any social change or political transformation should be founded on a spiritual awakening. Gandhi remained a Hindu by religious affiliation, but adopted a form of universal worship. He believed in the oneness of God and the legitimacy of all religions as leading to the same God, known by different names.  This 'Great Soul of India' (Mahatma) was indeed 'the light of the world'.  As Michael Nagler put it, &quot;He went into the heart of everything and touched the hearts of millions because he chose and clung to the one essential thing, which is to awaken God or Truth within the individual&quot;.<br />Gandhi's spiritual thoughts scattered in his various writings were put together as a book by M S Deshpande and published in India in 1971 under the title &quot;Pathway to God&quot;. This edition of it, slightly altered in content, is now available to the American readers for the first time. It has a 'Forward' by his grandson, Arun Gandhi and a very informative 'Introduction' by Michael Nagler. This book has captured the heart of the Mahatma whose life reflected every thought of his expressed in this book. This edition offers to the reader a wealth of spiritual insights providing food for reflection and meditation. A familiarity with some of the Hindu categories may help a better understanding of the spiritual concepts laid out in the book.	2001-10-11

Walter Burghardt, an accomplished homilist with 45 years of priestly experience and an authority in the art of preaching, shares his experience and expertise with the other preachers who look forward to improving their skills in this direction. He prescribes the use of imagination and careful preparation with due attention to Scripture and the day-to-day experience, for a good Sunday homily in the Catholic tradition. No doubt, this book is a mine of useful information and valuable insights. All the same, I was a little disappointed since I read here more about the content of the preaching rather than the art itself.

But the focus is on the glorious history of 181 years of the six great Moghuls like Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangazeb.  The book is very detailed with their expansionist adventures and exploits, their ruthless family struggles and sporty pass-times, their patronization of arts and architecture, their devotional practices along with their virtues and vices.  Over and above all that, their strategies of governance and approach to religion are in focus.  Their acts of tolerance and benevolence are given due credit and their cruelties are graphically portrayed.  In short the great Moghul era comes alive with the descriptive and substantially accurate account, accompanied by illustrations of 56 pages of color and 94 monochromes. Anyone interested in the history of the Indian subcontinent cannot bypass this book.	2001-09-24

He wrote, &quot;Religions are not for separating men from one another, they are meant to bring them together. It is a misfortune that today they are so distorted that they have become a potential cause of strife and mutual slaughter.&quot; No wonder, he was not in favor of conversion through proselytizing. He also considered it intolerance to believe that one's religion was superior to others'. That was his principal complaint against the preaching of the Christian missionaries. Today, more than half a century after his death, Gandhi's advice to the Christian missionaries is taken more seriously in the Indian subcontinent.  Gandhi held Jesus Christ in high esteem and the 'sermon of the mount' altered his life style. As Vincent Sheehan put it,  &quot;The most Christ-like man in history was not a Christian at all.&quot;<br />This magnificent book edited by Robert Ellsberg summarizes Gandhi's views on Jesus and Christianity. Part I of the book lays out Gandhi's own views through excerpts from his own writings, neatly arranged into four chapters. Part II has articles from Christian activists from USA, India and Bangladesh reflecting on the Gandhian view. It is an excellent book for any student of Christianity and a must-read for a missionary of any faith. It would have been beneficial to a student if there was an extensive bibliography on the subject included. This book has an important role in promoting tolerance and peace among religions and Robert Ellsberg deserves commendation.	2001-09-16

It was written originally in Russian for the Orthodox people and then translated into English for the sake of the western audience, largely Catholic and Protestant. The difficult and intriguing path of the Orthodox Church through the centuries is the subject matter of the book and it is narrated and interpreted in a scholarly manner here providing a sourcebook for ecumenical dialogue. In commenting on the difficult road of Orthodoxy through the centuries focussed on Byzantium, the author has endeavored to avoid any polemic against Western Christendom in an effort to understand the issues from a neutral standpoint. As a fairly accurate and dependable summary of the history of Eastern Orthodoxy, it is valuable to anyone intending to learn more about the Christian Church from the historical perspective.	2001-09-06

I read it in three hours, at one sitting though the experience itself was no fun. Trueblood is advocating a re-reading of the synoptic gospels focusing on the humor of Jesus Christ found in his wit, banter and irony.  In this approach of seeking humor, he seems to adopt a Bultmannian approach to the interpretation of the gospels.  I am afraid that in his eagerness to find humor in the saying and parables of Jesus, he has to be guarded not to end up doing disservice to the message itself.  But Elton Truebllod has brought out a wonderful area worthy of further exploration and possible research.	2001-08-20

It is a Master who tells the anecdotes and he could be a Hindu Guru, a Jewish Rabbi, a Muslim Mullah or a Christian Priest.

In view of the unity of the Christian churches, a deeper understanding of the Church Fathers, who are held in high esteem in all churches, is very important. It is this thesis that prompts Constantine Tsirpanlis, the president-founder of &quot;The American Institute for Patristic and Byzantine Studies Inc.&quot; to bring out this introductory volume. It is a &quot;thematic interpretative analysis of Patristic thought&quot; presenting the views of the Greek Fathers on Creation, Anthropology-Mariology, Christology-soteriology, Pneumatology-Ecclesiology-Asceticism and Eschatology. Comprising the whole theology of the Greek Fathers is no easy task and therefore deeper explanations of all the relevant issues are outside the scope of this book. The Latin and Syrian Fathers do not come within  his consideration either. His polemic attitude while speaking about subjects like filioque, canonization of saints, immaculate conception of Mary etc., diminishes the ecumenical value of the book.

Wide range of subjects are dealt with, clearly laying out the Orthodox view points and at the same time shedding sufficient light on other differing perspectives. His essays never degnerate into polemics.<br />Erickson explores the ways in which church concepts and issues developed through the centuries. Concepts have shifted in their meaning considerably and in order to understand them adequately today, a historical investigation is necessary. The issues dividing Christians of the East and the West also need to be understood in a historical perspective in order to explore new ways of expressing Church's unity and continuity. He makes the strong point that the Church's past history, her traditions and canons challenge us today to put and end to polemics and work harder for unity.

The Indian name of the author had drawn me to this book, the story of an 18 year old Indian girl from the south who runs away to The City in the north to escape the marriage arranged by her drunken father and ends up as a maid in the household of  Mr Aziz and Ms Marceau. As I continued reading more about this stereotype of an abused Indian female deserving our sympathy and needing redemption, it dawned on me that there was nothing Indian about the narrative. It became evident to me that the author had no first hand knowledge of contemporary India. In dealing with the escapades of the free-spirited teenage girl, the author fails to address the issues of the status of women and the cultural restrictions on them. He does not know the barriers and taboos dictated by the caste system which is still alive in the minds of Indians. The diversity of cultures and the difficulties posed by the variety in languages do not seem to concern the author. The teenage girl after traveling alone for 24 hours by train from a Kannada speaking town in the south reaches The City without any trouble and joins the servants of the Aziz family to begin work immediately. The Aziz family is only half Indian, drinking wine and eating steak. But the servant women drinking champagne with the masters, smoking cigarettes and taking day-offs also are unlike servants in any Indian household.

It is like a pilgrimage to the holy river Ganges which Christians should consider pagan and unchristian. Besides, the filth, pollution and the unhygienic surroundings are all there. But there is a surrounding aura of love, peace and regeneration. Ganges, the Mother of India despite all filth, is a mother with plenitude and gentleness. This novel is the story of a group of Japanese tourists to India. The various characters are brought to light in the background of the teeming life and activity around Ganges in the city of Varanasi. Each character has a past that is heavy on the person. The river Ganges called 'the river of humanity' and 'the river of love' has a great depth of meaning for each one of them. It is indeed a deep river from which they all gain consolation, liberation and a new birth. The characters like Isobe, Kiguchi, Numanda, Mitsuko and Otsu vary in their backgrounds and interests. Most of them do not have much in common except for Mitsuko and Otsu. Each of them has a story and their lives do not cross much. The plot of the novel in this respect is most unusual. All of them converge on the banks of river Ganges in pursuit of rejuvenation.<br />India, where the ancient civilization flowered on the banks of the great river Indus, serves as the backdrop for the novel. Most of the events take place in Varanasi, on the banks of the river Ganges in the months of October-November 1984. The dark forests, the natural environment, the peaceful temples with their gods and godesses, the lively idols of Kali and Chamunda, the crowded city of Varanasi, the various river ghats of Ganges with all the droppings of dogs and cows and the filth, the cremation ground with the smell of burning flesh, the river itself with milky tea-colored water, and the dusty isolated villages with communal wells become very lively to the reader. The band of scrawny children crying out for Bakshish, the snake charmer with the cobra and the mongoose, the sadhoos and godmen giving blessings to the devotees, the wedding procession of the rich couple in the holy city are fit to create strong impressions in the mind. The political background of the time, such as the assassination of Indira Gandhi the prime minister and the subsequent riots in New Delhi, the funeral and the immersion of her ashes in the river Yamuna are clearly brought out. Endo has a deep knowledge of India, its people and their ways of thinking.<br />Shusaku Endo is known as the Graham Greene of the East. But, though his novels can be considered Catholic, they are controversial. His deep knowledge of Christianity in the West and in the East makes it easy for him to write very powerfully.

The present novel seems to focus mainly on the depth of the spirituality of the East which the  western mind fails to comprehend. The pictures he paints of the gods and goddesses and the river are often disgusting and disturbing. It is these that offer consolation to the seminarian who is disappointed with the western Christianity, to the non believer like Mitsuko and to a host of others tormented by their own personal problems.kshish, the snake charmer with the cobra and the mongoose, the sadhoos and godmen giving blessings to the devotees, the wedding procession of the rich couple in the holy city are fit to create strong impressions in the mind.

Reading the novel 'House of Spirits' was indeed an experience or rather a nightmare-like experience. I could not help being haunted by the various scenes depicting strong passions and unbridled emotions, brutal rapes, cold murders, bloody battles and human tortures. Did I enjoy reading it? I am not sure. Did it have a kind of  Cathartic effect on me? May be.  According to the author this is a section of the chain of tragic events through centuries 'in an unending tale of sorrow, blood and love'. The narrator's intention is to break this chain.<br />The protagonist in the story is Esteban Trueba, a character with whom the reader can hardly identify. He is a willful man given to fits of rage and haunted by loneliness. His infatuation for Rosa the beautiful brings him to the light in the story. Her death and his subsequent rise in economic power as the respected and honored 'patron' of 'Tres Marias' lead him to marry the clairvoyant Clara, Rosa's sister who though frail in her frame has contacts with the spirits and an unusual gift of premonition regarding future events. They begin to live in an extravagant house which becomes 'the big house on the corner' a place of hectic activity throughout the rest of the novel. Clara the spiritualist gets soon exposed to the world of Esteban Trueba in Tres Marias, where a true capitalist system in which the landlord lives in luxury at the cost of the workers who have no personalities of their own, exits. Soon we see signs of their uprising in the new generation's reaction to the oppression. The children of Esteban Trueba as well as his wife Clara seem to welcome a change. Esteban in his turn, to enhance his glory and influence enters politics and soon becomes an influential Congressman in the conservative party. The socialists gain more and more control through democratic means and get voted to power. By this point the story of Esteban Trueba and family becomes the story of the struggles of an unidentified nation in South America. The socialists are overthrown by the military coup with the patronage of capitalists like Senator Esteban Trueba. A blood battle follows in which many are killed and Senator Esteban and his grand daughter Alba are left in the big house on the corner. Soon she too is arrested and  tortured. In order to effect her release Esteban has to beg for the assistane of the woman at the brothel. He realizes his mistake in bringing down the democratically elected socialist Government and encouraging the military coup. Finally Alba and her grandfather together put down the account of his life in writing. Then he has a peaceful death.<br />The passionate love of Blanca for Pedro Tercero Garcia and her marriage to Jean de Satigny, the eccentricities of Nicholas and Jaime, the sufferings of Amanda and the growth of the terrorist Miguel, the spiritual persuits of Clara and the Mora sisters, the rise to power of Esteban Garcia who being the grandson of Esteban Trueba inherited his cruel nature, the birth and early life of Alba the daughter of Blanca and Pedro Garcia are also dealt in detail in the book.<br />Alba who writes the events down sees fate playing an important part in everything and she is resigned. Finally, we readers are confronted by a strong sense of waste.The socialists are overthrown by the military coup with the patronage of capitalists like Senator Esteban Trueba.

This book contains seventyone homilies in order of the Liturgical year of the Church intended for the Sundays and holy days of the year. I found these very captivating and every homily provided some fruit for thought and reflection. These are fruits of deep reflection and prayer and some of them provide unique insights into the readings. His use of illustrative stories throughout the book makes it artistically valuable and some of these stories are humorous and worth remembering.

He defines Liturgical Theology as an independent discipline with its own special subject and corresponding special method.  The different themes are developed in the book in reference to the 'Ordo' or shape of worship as it evolved in the Orthodox Church from the earliest years. This book with an introduction and four other chapters, deals with the importance of the study of Liturgical Theology, the Origin and development of Liturgy,  the contributions from Jewish worship, and the importance of monasticism to Liturgy.<br />This is the basic book for anyone who wishes to study Liturgical Theology. It is sufficiently clear and complete in itself. The book does not contain a bibliography or detailed index notes, which would have been valuable for the students. In some cases the author is constrained to put the Greek words as they are without any equivalent English words, which makes some proficiency in Greek a must for the understanding of the text.	2001-05-09

The present book provides an introduction. The book deals with the Church Fathers from the council of Nicea to Pope Leo the Great. This period from 325 to 461 is called the golden age of patristic literature. The Fathers represented here are Cyril of Jerusalem, Hilary of Poitiers, Basil of Caesaria, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, Theodore of Mopsuestia, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine of Hippo, Cyril of Alexandria, Theodoret of Cyrus, and Leo the Great. It contains short biographic sketches of the Fathers represented here and citations from their writings carefully categorized under different headings.<br />The great contributions of the post-Nicene Fathers of the Church in the direction of the development of dogmas on Trinity, Holy Spirit and the nature of Christ are well brought out. A thorough study of the contexts in which these patristic writings appeared, is essential to understand the texts. Bettenson is short and sketchy in these contexts, since the book is intented to be only an introduction.	2001-04-30

The background of the novel is the persecution of Christians in Japan in the early seventeenth century. There are lots of  historical elements in the novel. The Samurai who undertook a voyage in 1613 seems to have kept a journal of his experiences abroad. Fr Luis Sotelo the model for Valesco is also a historical person. Besides, the author as the first Japanese to study abroad after the war acknowledges that there are also some autobiographical elements in the novel. The Samurai called Rokuemon Hasekura and Fr Velasco a missionary of the Franciscan Order are the main characters. Both are on a mission to the Nueva Espana, Espana and Rome as a Japanese envoy and his Spanish interpreter respectively. They plan to meet the King as well as the Pope. Both are eager to make their mission successful. Blinded by their own ambitions, both of them fail to see the truths before them. Both of them meet with disappointment and defeat. Soon they realize their mistakes, but too late to save their own lives. They gradually come to an understanding of what it really means to follow Christ, and embrace martyrdom.<br />There are various themes that are dealt with in the novel in a profoundly powerful manner. The snobbishness of the religion preached by the affluent clergy, the relevance of the sufferings and death of Christ to the ordinary people, the fickleness and pride of the Japanese people, the political strategies of the Japanese rulers, the ambitions of the foreign missionaries, the rivalries between missionary orders etc are only some of them.	2001-04-26

Through this book Louis Fischer successfully presents the Mahatma of India to the English speaking world at large and especially to the Americans.The soul of Mahatma Gandhi is well captured here in words. The author takes pains to elaborate the political movements in Britain, the varied struggles of Indians in South Africa and the complexities of the socio-political situation in India in order to paint an accurate picture of one of the most remarkable human beings of the 20th century. The philosophy and witness of this Indian saint shall continue to influence and enrich the lives of millions in the years to come and Fischer's deeply moving story of his struggles shall go down into history as a worthy testimony to his life and message.<br />The book does inevitably contain Indian words and concepts, which could stand in the way of making it a leisurely reading. But the author has a great advantage since he has a familiarity with the Indian situation and a personal acquaintence with Gandhi himself. Anyone who is intereested in working for the advancement of humanity should learn about Gandhi and this is the book to begin with.	2001-04-23

In this valuable book Leo Donald Davis, a Roman Catholic priest takes an objective look at the history of the Church and the theological story of the council meetings during the first seven ecumenical councils. Each chapter of the book is dedicated to one council; the circumstances that led to the council, the convening of the council, the actual deliberations and the aftermath of the council. The seven ecumenical council dealt with are the councils of Nicea I, Constantinople I, Ephesus, Chalcedon, Constantinople II, Constantinople III and Nicea II.<br />The life of the Church during these councils was very much intertwined with secular history. Secular politics and theological controversieis were often intermingled. The eccelsiastical rivalries were sometimes much worse than the political ones.  The author deals with history in an objective manner and is preoccupied with showing the gruesome facts without taking any sides. The faithful people need to note that the Holy Spirit worked through all these persons and situations.<br />It is a delightful book. After having read this, our outlook on the Church and her doctrines will no more be the same.	2001-04-21

As a teacher Dr Meyendorff is clear and accurate in his coverage of the different aspects of theology.<br />As a Roman Catholic I was impressed by the striking similarities between the Byzantine doctirnes and the Roman Catholic faith. The author is objective and clear in his exposition. He seemed a little preoccupied with comparing and contrasting the theological doctirines of the Byzantine  Church with those of the  West. This seemed to limit the scope of the book.  As a book dealing with theology, it is a successful work beneficial to those looking for some insight into the theological doctirnes and their development in the Church.	2001-04-21

He founded and led religious communities and officiated at the prayer services of these groups rather regularly. For this he had drawn from Hindu, Moslem, Christian, Sikh and Jain traditions and brought out a book of prayers known as the Ashram Bhajanavali and the present book is the American version of it.  The prayers betray a great poetic artistry and deep creativity and they are true expressions of the mystical experiences of Gandhi 'not too dissimilar to the spirit of the Psalms'. I have found this collection very helpful for deep reflection and meditation. And it can be recommended as a source of strength and inspiration for a believer in God.  Gandhi believed that God, Allah and Brahman are different names of the same Universal Principle. The Hindu, Moslem, Sikh and Jain verses in the book reflect this view of Gandhi's religion. His familiarity with the great mystics of India like Kabir, Mirabai and Tulsidas are very evident. The prayers quoted from these mystics contain allusions to the well known stories of the puranas, references to the Indian theological traditions and Sanskrit words and phrases along with the names of some Hindu gods and goddesses. Therefore these prayers cannot be recommended to the uninitiated in the Indian traditions.<br />The book also contains two Christian hymns, namely 'When I survey the wondrous Cross' by Isaac Watts and 'Lead, kindly light ..' by Cardinal John Newman. These were Gandhi's favorite hymns. This edition of the book has also a forward by Arun Gandhi the grandson of the Mahatma and a very informative introduction by Michael N Nagler.	2001-04-20

'Story Power' is his contribution to the preachers and teachers who look for such readymade stories for illustration. The book consists of 125 stories neatly organized under 25 headings. There is a wide variety among them from fables to personal witnesses. Most of these stories end with  a humorous twist so much so one cannot help reflecting upon the truth presented.

In laying out the how and why of using this art in different ways in the sermons, Bruce ends up offering an excellent guide for those who would like to use stories, whether deductively, illustratively or as metaphors.<br />The book also gives an elborate bibliography for the sake of a ministerial student who wants to explore further the narrative form of preaching before he/she ventures into it.<br />Xavier Thelakkatt	2000-11-28

Thulin classifies personal story preaching into four different types, though that classification could be called a bit arbitrary. Out of the four types, the one called 'self portrayal' is the type that would be most effective. The reasons he gives  are well thought-out and the examples are excellent. This would be a basic guidebook for those who  intend to experiment with personal stories in preaching. The check list and the table at the end are particulaly helpful.<br />If the book provided a good bibliography for the material dealt, it would have been a help for those who wanted to explore further on the subject.<br />Xavier Thelakkatt	2000-11-28
