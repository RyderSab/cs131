It has believable characters, a very good mystery, a knack for making the reader feel at home in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, an easy style, and Alex is a very likeable protagonist. Also, Hamilton's descriptions of winter are extremely vivid. I can't wait for Hamilton's next book. There is one error that I feel compelled to point out. On page 32 Hamilton writes that there are one or two Beer Stores &quot;in every town in Canada, from Vancouver to Prince Edward Island.&quot; That is incorrect: the Beer Store can be found only in Ontario. (He is correct when he says it's a wonderful place.) A very small point, but still ...	2000-09-26

Cuddy is honorable, tough and smart (although a bit too sanctimonious) and  the other characters are always vivid and believable.  The mystery here is  first-rate; I was shaking my head in amazement after all the pieces came  together.  Healy deserves to be a lot better known and successful.	2000-01-12

Over the last couple years I ahve forced myself to leisurely read this series, because I enjoy it so much and don't want to  run out of Brady Coyne mysteries.  Alas, I have just the current one  remaining.  These books are written intelligently and exceedingly well.   Brady is like an old friend.  Tapply deserves to be a best-seller; his  books are so much better than the drivel by Grisham and other  mystery/thriller writers.	2000-01-12

I never felt like I understood the story; it was like I'd dropped in the middle of it and little idea of what was happening.  I had no feelings towards any of the characters, and didn't  find any of them likable or even compelling.  Also, I didn't like the  frequency of the use of sentence fragments.  On the plus side, I did like  the vivid descriptions of the northwoods.  I really wanted to like this  book, but I just didn't.	2000-01-05

None of the characters resonated with me; indeed, they all seemed one-dimensional.  Where was the vice president during all this?  Did the politicians get the message?  We  have no idea if they decided to shape up.	1999-12-28

However, I found virtually all of the characters to be dislikable.  Also, I was hoping for the Newfoundland setting to affect the story, but  really it could have taken place anywhere in Canada or even the US where  hockey is popular.	1999-11-30

I had to force myself to read it slowly so I could savor it.  The writing is simple and beautiful, the setting and climate are evoked  descriptively, the main characters are honorable, courageous, and likable,  and the McPheron brothers are fabulous.  I knew it would be excellent when  I saw on the back cover that Richard Russo and Howard Frank Mosher, two of  my very favorite authors, praised it.	1999-11-29

The characters are interesting and the descriptions of Maine are great (I live an hour or so from Mr. Boyle), and Jack is a fine  character, but the pace is a bit slow this time.  Also, Jack's wry humor  isn't as much in evidence, and I think Roxanne is a lot more trouble than  she's worth--dump her, Jack.  I'm looking forward to COVER STORY in  January.	1999-11-04

The things I liked:  Belfer writes well and often  elegantly; the portrait of turn of the century high society was  fascinating; the complexity of the story.  The things I didn't like:   Louisa Barrett is TOO self-righteous and sanctimonious, and Grover  Cleveland's reputation was needlessly besmirched.  I don't know much about  him and have no special affection for him, but I don't believe such a  disparaging portayal of him was called for--a fictitious governor or other  figure would have worked.  Finally, I could relate to the story well  because my grandmother lives on Soldiers Place (mentioned several times),  just a few houses down from the Buffalo Seminary (Macauly School).	1999-10-25
US	52546533	R1FIXLSDFHZ9PE	0395984165	522471250	The Fall of the Year	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Absolutely wonderful	I have enjoyed all of Howard Frank MOsher's books, particularly NORTHERN BORDERS.  This book is a great addition to his work.  The stories about the people of Kingdom County are sagacious, loving and enchanting.  I thought  the book started a bit slowly, but it ineluctably gained steam, getting  better and better, and it culminated in a magical, wonderful way.  Mosher's  descriptions of small town life in northern New England evoke a nostalgic  era that has passed, and his portrait of the North Country itself is vivid.   This is a magical, marvelous book, and I hope it is a success for Mr.  Mosher.	1999-09-28

The stories are enchanting, the evocations of life in a small town are on the money, and the Vermont  setting is vibrant.  I also liked the way he discreetly mentioned  characters from past books.  Mosher deserves to be on the best seller  lists.  I hope the wait for his next novel is not as long!	1999-09-28

Billy Bob Holland and Dave Robicheaux are pretty much the same character, and the  last few books have had the same elements over and over again.  On the  positive side, Mr. Burke's writing is as stunningly beautiful as ever.	1999-08-29

Everything was great: the settings, the dialogue, the story, and the characters.

The reader from Virginia who gave  this novel one star is utterly wrong.	1999-08-12

What a life this guy led!  My only disappointment is that at the end he didn't tell us how he (apparently) turned his life around.  The negative  reviews I read here must have been written by abstemious, uptight people  with no sense of humor.	1999-08-10

Crais has taken his work to the next level.  I read it in one day, which leaves me in the unfortunate position of having to wait at least a year for the next Elvis book.  I do have two picayune quibbles.  First, on page 19,  how does Elvis know that Ronnie's claim to fame is a Charmin commercial?   Second, on page 252, the Spanish is wrong:  it's esperar, not es perar, and  it's cuidado, not quidado.	1999-07-12

Lehane's writing is great; he deserves to be on bestseller lists.

First, I simply didn't find Broker to be a compelling protagonist.  He just isn't that likable; he's uptight, unemotional (he barely related to  his baby and his wife), and detached.  Second, the transformation of James  from hapless loser to what he becomes seemed a stretch.  Third, and most  important, I disliked Chuck Logan's style. One, I didn't like the  herky-jerky, staccato sentence fragments.  Two, there was a lot of clunky,  unwieldy phraseology (duty &quot;thudded through room after empty  room&quot;).  Three, the grammar was odd-commas were omitted, periods were  used where there should have been question marks, and commas were used  where semicolons belong.  My negative comments are obviously in the  minority, but I just didn't like the style.	1999-05-03

There's been nothing new in the last few entrants in the series; it's basically been the same plot with  different characters.   Even Cimarron Rose was really a Robicheaux novel;  Burke just changed the setting and the protagonist's name.   I hate to say  anything negative, because I love Burke's writing.  His early novels were  excellent; it's time to write a different story.	1999-04-22

Still, I found the girls a bit too precious; their friendship contrived; some characters (especially  the twins and the father) to be so undeveloped as to be irrelevant; and  just a general lack of pizzazz.   The comparisons to To Kill A Mockingbird  are wrong; this book does not come close.   My opinion is obviously in the  minority, bubt I just don't think this book is all that good.	1999-04-13

Cecil is a great, believable character, the mystery is puzzling, and the descriptions of Alaska are evocative.  Straley's writing is magical and sometimes stopped me cold.   His prose is  just as fine as James Lee Burke's.	1999-04-13

While some of the dialogue was stiff, most of it rang true and some of the banter was quite witty. The reviewers who have been so critical of the dialogue must  not talk to many 20-30-year-olds. This is a very entertaining book.   So  many reviewers on Amazon are hypercritical and even vicious; I think they  expect every book they read to be a literary masterpiece for the ages, an  expectation that is ridiculous and unrealistic.  I like being entertained  by the many books I read, and this book fits the bill.	1999-04-08

It's not great, but it's good and quite entertaining and the action is non-stop.  I honestly can't understand why so many reviewers here have been so negative  and picayune.  Folks, thrillers don't have to be realistic; they're  supposed to be entertaining and diverting, and on those groounds this book  satisfies.	1999-04-05

The action is exciting, the characters are engaging, and the portrait of Russia is chilling  (if everything I've ever read about Russia is close to true, what a depressing place, full of  pollution, deprivation, and misery).  The critical reviews by some readers  are way too harsh:  sure, the ending is a bit unbelievable, but this is a  good book--lighten up.	1999-03-01
