I saw it in Chicken Soup for the Single's Soul. And sure enough, there was the same author's name. Great story. And so are many of the others. I especially liked &quot;Whinny,&quot; about a girl who loved horses. And I found the Christmas stories very moving. &quot;The Trellis,&quot; about a grandson's memories of his grandparents' love for each other, was terrific. And the tall talein which the old men conned the young boy was hilarious. A perfect gift for anyone who likes Chicken Soup kinds of stories!	2002-03-23

The work Barbara and Christopher Roden have done in collecting these fresh and original stories of the ghostly and macabre is a true labor of love, and it's greatly appreciated. They're the driving force behind the worldwide organization The Ghost Story Society, the magazine All Hallows, and World Fantasy Award-winning and Stoker Award-winning (awarded by the Horror Writers Association) Ash-Tree Press. Shadows and Silence, a sequel to their highly touted Midnight Never Comes anthology, is a top-notch anthology containing original stories from both old pro's and rising stars. Almost all of the stories received Honorable Mentions or were published in Year's Best Fantasy &amp; Horror, St. Martins' prestigious annual anthology. This is a limited edition hardcover whose cash value begins to appreciate as soon as the book is released. A great way to sample the best new stuff in the horror/supernatural/ghostly genre.	2002-03-23

A great way to sample the best old and new writers in the fantasy and horror genres. As with previous annual anthologies in the series, Datlow and Windling have pulled together a great collection, all stories drawn from books, chapbooks, and magazines published in the year 2000. The stories come from all over the globe, wherever weird stories are published in an English-language edition--Canada, USA, England, Ireland, Scotland, Australia. Besides a sampling of the best stories, there are wrap-ups of the year in both genres (fantasy &amp; horror), necrology of persons related to the fields, overviews of magazines, ezines, books, movies, recordings, personalities, and so much more, including the titles, authors, and sources of the stories which made Honorable Mention but didn't get in. A cornucopia of information on horror and fantasy in the Year 2000. No mistake this volume is the size and weight of a seminarian's study Bible; it is the bible of the two genres, and a bargain for the money.	2002-03-23

Some are campfire tales you'd hear at a Scout camporee, plain old fun ghost stories (&quot;Capt James' Bones&quot; and &quot;Garden Plot&quot;). Others are more literary, like the romantic ghost stories &quot;Lighthouse Moths&quot; and &quot;The Ice Fisherman&quot;. Another is a very creative new Urban Legend, &quot;The Mason's Leech.&quot; &quot;Casino Night&quot; is a very scary look at the future of gambling. &quot;The Strand&quot; reminds one of M.R. James's or H.P. Lovecraft's stories, as does &quot;The Witness Tree.&quot; &quot;Where Lions Hide&quot; is a combination story that's &quot;Man vs Best&quot; action plus fantasy (shape-changing). It's easy to see why this collection's nine stories have already picked up 6 Honorable Mentions in The Year's Best Fantasy &amp; Horror anthologies. A terrific first horror collection from an author known for his popular radio Christmas stories.	2002-01-17

An encouraging and witty book that declares it's okay to be single. There are tons of ideas for one woman to do.

Books	5	10	10	N	N	Great ideas, though not a totally reader-friendly book!	I had to give it five stars because it did such a job stimulating me with its new ideas about creating. At times it's slow to pore over. You're excited at the stuff you're learning, but the prose feels a bit tedious, so it's like being chin-deep in water and wanting to race ashore for something great. But this book's concepts, about the structure of creating, are so mind-blowing to us &quot;creatives&quot; that it's a must to sit and take it a swallow at a time. Fritz's challenging ideas allowed me to expand my thinking about myself, to see myself not as a writer but as a creating person (one of whose creating modes is writing). My promotion of my written materials is an act of creating. So is the plan I'm putting together for my life. Wow!	2001-02-28

He looks at society's pressures, the bigger-is-better mentality, the cultural bias against what appear to be the larger, more &quot;successful&quot; churches' poorer and small cousins. But this pastor and former Presbyterian National Small Church Division Exec examines their strengths and points out how unique small churches are, showing how and why we need to see them as different &quot;critters&quot; (organisms) than larger churches (organizations). Good clear examples and well spun-out, easy-to-grasp theory.  -Steve Burt, national small church consultant and author of Activating Leadership in the Small Church, and The Little Church That Could: Raising Small Church Esteem.	2001-02-10

Pappas's 20 years as pastor at the Harbor Baptist Church on Block Island gave him a laboratory to work in. But he also took his thirst for understanding the small church on the road, doing scores of programs around the country. This book is the best written about understanding the entity called the small church. His comparisons of pastor to missionary and anthropologist really make it clear. And, this book may be out of print, but it's just been revised and rereleased in 2000. So try and find the updated one.

We'd heard about the book, but hadn't read it. What a treat. First, it surprised us to hear it in rhyme. But it wasn't rhymy, if you know what I mean. It flowed, and the sentences weren't doing somersaults to make the rhyme scheme work. It was great prose, too, not just poetry. And the narrative which carried the sentiment was so touching. Not even a half hour for both this story and the sequel, both of which were on the same cassette. Lovely. Delightful. Sorry I hadn't discovered it earlier.  reviewed by Steve Burt, author of A CHRISTMAS DOZEN FROM THE CHRISTMAS STORY PASTOR.	2001-02-08

For too long they've been treated like the poorer cousins, the second class citizens, when they're really something altogether different. Dr. Burt has surely shown himself to be a champion for the cause in this book, and his suggestions and ideas are appropriate to the small church.
