I thought it would be filled with interesting insights into this killer 21st century disease, but he spends way too much time blaming everyone on the planet but the SARS pathogen itself for the evolution of this plague.

I tried to like this novel because as one who believes in predestination, I thought it would show some of the opposing arguments in fictional form; it failed to do this.  James Hogg merely shows us a deranged human being (nothing new there!) who murders because he feels that he is 'destined for heaven' no matter what he does. Yes, he might have been saved from the fires of hell, but it would have been by God's grace, not by his own good or evil works. Isn't this what the New Testament is all about-grace in spite of man's evil doing? Whether one is predestined or 'chooses good or evil' makes no difference in the end-what matters is who saves you from your own mortal destiny which is death. This story fails to show any unique theological and/or psychological perspective. I was dissatisfied with the author's far-fetched and anti-logical presentation of a doctrine he clearly did not understand.	2005-10-09

The author could have done so many good, righteous things and yet not be a true believer in God/Christ.  Even atheists falter sometimes in their religion and cry out, \\"Oh God!\\"  Any mention of this supreme Deity, this Lord of Heaven & Earth is a hypocritical statement in an atheist's vocabulary, and Barker has lost more than his faith--he has lost his hope in anything but this wretched, damned, hellish life.  <br /> <br />There must be something more to this world than just what our eyes see and what our hands feel. Throughout the centuries mortals have believed and served a Presence greater than themselves. It is only in the age of materialistic wealth, longevity, and Darwinian thought that atheism has blinded so many eyes.   <br /> <br />I found Dan Barker's story horribly depressing for so many reasons and on so many levels. I put the book down and felt such darkness and loneliness that I asked my husband to just put a bullet through my skull!  This cruel life is just not worth it apart from a Heavenly Being and a careful, intelligent plan that includes mortals.  Christianity offers its followers the one thing that Dan cannot: Hope.  Why would he want to take this beautiful thing away from anyone? That is what makes his book so terribly sad, and so painful to read. Words of healing, inspiration, hope and peace are not to be found in this disheartening book.  God have mercy on Dan Barker, he knows not how deeply he discourages his readers.	2005-09-23

A Journey into Prayer is yet another fabulous, unforgettable, and thrilling look at how prayer can change us and the world we live in! I was reminded afresh of how IMMEASURABLE & INEXHAUSTIBLE the riches of God are! Some books are so fun to read over and over again for spiritual refreshment, this is one of those books.

There was almost a misanthropic feel to the entire text, as though she always hated people, men especially, and being brutally raped was the perfect excuse to case her hatred of the human race in a book and sell it.  I felt sorry for what she endured, and I applaud her courage and bravery in recovering from that traumatic event.  I didn't care to hear about her entire childhood and bizarre relationship with her parents.  I just felt that she wandered endlessly, and didn't stay focused on the story that was truly hers.  Sadly, this is not one of the better memoirs about rape/sexual assault.  There just isn't enough substantial material in the author's life to fill 250 odd pages.	2005-06-20

The agony of 4,000 days in the hellish prisons, solitary confinement, etc. is beyond imagination.  This book is more shocking than anything I have read apart from a few survival stories of men & women who endured communist and/or Nazi concentration camps.  Warren's story is just as absorbing, just as terrifying, and truly an incredible testimony to his courageous spirit.

The author gives all sorts of anecdotes about poisons, toxins, and various other chemicals that are dangerous to humans and animals.  Some of the stories he weaves throughout the text are utterly absorbing and even mildly shocking!  I came away from this book even more convinced that if I definitely don't want to die from poison of any kind, any brand, or derived from any plant!  The slow, agonizing death that occurs from poison has been largely overlooked by society, and this is a perplexing oversight.  Poisonous substances are truly fascinating, but dreadful when ingested, inhaled, or injected into a man or woman.  A very well-written, superbly documented, and engaging book.

There is no real cohesive message outside of her ranting against President Bush, pro-life conservatives, etc.  She presents herself as a deeply committed Christian, and I honestly believe that she is, but then she says so many thoughtless, careless, and even arrogant things.   <br /> <br />Arrogance is perhaps the one characteristic that makes this book so rough on the windpipe.  I believe that Anne Lamott has a big heart, but she also has a big mouth which often discounts her core message (but then again, one is never really sure if she actually has a 'core message').  I wish she would mature a little through her writing rather than regressing with every book.	2005-04-26

I have read several biographies about John Calvin and I must say that this is by far the best one I've come across!  The author is down-to-earth, a little scholastic at times but not too heady.  He shows us the man behind the many diabolical and misleading myths.  Calvin was an incredibly devout man who deserves to be treated with respect and careful consideration by our own generation.  I learned so much about this great Protestant Reformer from this book.  A timely masterpiece!	2005-04-11
