Mix them all together and you have Joan Bauer's teenage(and for those teens at heart, like me)story.  AJ is really into photography AND loves Peter Terris.  With the Valentine's Day Dance fast approaching and dateless, she feels hopeless.  Then one day, a cupid named Jonathan enters her life.  Not many of us have actually met a cupid have we?  So, here we have a YA novel with some very unrealistic premises yet it is so superbly written piece we go with the story.  it is called \\"Thwonk\\" because that is the noise the arrow makes when Jonathan's arrow goes soaring through the air and into the hearts of those struck.<br /><br />Jonathan asks our jaded artist for a wish, and her wish is for Peter to love her. LOVE her is the least he does as he takes her on a rollercoaster ride.  After that last loop, AJ learns some important lessons about herself, friends/school mates, and LOVE.<br /><br />\\"Thwonk\\" is charming, sweet, fast paced, and lovable right to the last page.<br /><br />Eileen F.	2005-10-04

I had heard really good things, read so many other YA novels, yet hadn't read Block's work. It is supposed to be so poetic, lyrical, and unusual.<br /><br />This was very weird.

This is a great sequel to an equally stunning and entertaining read, \\"Rules of the Road\\".<br /><br />Bauer has vastly impressed me with all her books I've read thus far, but this one was like a big fat cherry along with the whipped creme on top of the hot fudge sundae known as \\"Rules of the Road\\".<br /><br />Jenna Boller is back, back with a vengence alongside the owner and her boss, Madeline Gladstone.  There are some new characters that add flavor to an already sweet treat of a story.<br /><br />For anyone who just likes a good plot and lots of laughs, I recommend this. It may be targeted at teenagers(those teenagers are darn lucky cuz there were no writers like this in my teen days), but at 36, I have grown into a great fan of Joan Bauer's writing. She is very talented at telling a tale that is funny and endearing.  It is a really easy read that I know younger girls will really enjoy because while I may be 36, deep down, I am still a teenager at heart.<br /><br />Eileen F.	2005-08-12

After reading a review of her newest book, \\"Best Foot Forward\\", I learned I had to read this first to get the whole story in \\"Best...\\"<br /><br />Jenna Boller, the main character from \\"Rules of the Road\\" continues her journey through teenaged life in \\"Best Foot Forward\\".<br /><br />This book made me laugh a lot.  Bauer is not only a gifted writer, but she is great at comedy.  They are honest to goodness told stories that have messages and a wide range of characters.  Jenna works for Gladstone's Shoe Store, and the whole company is about to change hands. However, Madeline Gladstone, one of the original owners, has something to say about that - and not something nice.  She asks Jenna to be her driver when she goes to Texas for a stockholder's meeting.  Jenna's pilgrimage is not just about getting from Chicago to Texas. It is also about evolving, helping others, and meeting some wonderful people along the way.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book not only for teenaged girls, but for everyone.  Bauer's writing is briliant and witty. I've only read one other book of hers, but I will definitely be reading them all at some point.  She inspires me.<br /><br />Eileen F.	2005-08-05

I think it shouldn't have a genre, like Stargirl..it must not be like all the others around it in it's society. I am 35 years old, and I LOVED this book by the brilliant Jerry Spinelli. Why - it was easy to follow and get into and it brought me back to those days with such clarity.<br /><br />This is the only book of his I've read, but you can be rest assured that I will be stocking my children's bookshelves with his entire body of work.<br /><br />Leo Borlock narrates - Stargirl is new to the school, unusual yet sweet, and a true individual.  As things unfurl between them, they develop a true friendship. Jerry Spinelli does a truly wonderful job giving his characters depth(Especially Stargirl) and meaning.  He is one of the best writers I've read anything from lately. I hadn't read anything this quickly in a long time, that's how hooked I was on this short and sweet and shining work.<br /><br />One thing about most high school students, male or female, is most of us like to be well liked but the underlying meaning to it all in those years is to be true oneself no matter how outside the \\"norm\\" you may be. Be you, and that should be all that matters - sort of like Stargirl. Because you may just stay inside someone's head for years and years..like Leo.<br /><br />Eileen F.	2005-01-19

I was very disappointed and gave up half way through.  Of course, my mind is more open to different kinds of books now. \\"The Honk and Holler Opening soon\\" was a gift I got recently, and of course, I was a bit hesitant to read it after the first book experience.<br /><br />It came highly recommended by someone who's opinion I truly value, and I quickly got into it.  Billie Letts' characters are all very realistically drawn out and while it wasn't a plot driven as some people may want it to be, it had a certain charm all it's own as one of those \\"slice of life\\" type books.<br /><br />It's as if I was peering into the \\"Honk & Holler\\" itself stealing a glance and listen at other's people's lives.<br /><br />My whole image of Letts is completely blown out of the water, and I am now a fan of her work. I am glad I gave her a second chance with this little book.<br /><br />Like I said, it's got a plot but I really think it's more about fleshing out the characters like Caney, Vena, Molly O, and Bui.<br /><br />All from different walks of life and backgrounds, they come together to teach an important lesson in how you don't have to be related to be a family.<br /><br />Eileen F.	2004-08-21

I also plan to read it again, and again, and again.<br />Chock full of the insecurities I myself felt as a 15 year old gilr, like \\"Virginia Shreves\\", who is the girl in this funny but sad tale.<br />The main reason I like this character and this book so much as it mirrors my own teenaged life so well.  Maternal denial, sisters that move away because of it, and food being stuffed thy throat. This novel is the perfect recipe for my life as a teenager.<br />Virginia, however, learns that lesson about life being what YOU make it and not what others make of it, learns much sooner than I did. Froth with realistic dialogue this is a book I highly recommend to girls of all ages. It is brightly written and Carolyn Mackler has earned my highest respect.  Buy this one as Virginia is a friend you will want to visit again.	2004-05-08

The only series I've ever gotten into as a mystery reader.  Sparkle's writing is intelligent and witty.  Even with the myriad assortment of characters throughout the story, they all serve a purpose and Sparkle is so good at making them all have meaning and not add confusion.<br />Robin's apartment building burns down, and she takes shelter at the &quot;Chelsea&quot;. An out of town friend left her a key to her place there, and Sparkle takes advantage.  Little does she know what she's about to get herself into.  As she seems to do in all the stories.  It is still extremely entertaining and a laugh out loud book.<br />What I love most about this book is Sparkle's witty dialogue, and how she chose the illustrious &quot;Chelsea hotel&quot; as her set.<br />This is worth reading if you like funny/mystery stories.  Robin Hudson is a character I always look forward to reading more about.<br />Eileen F.	2004-04-18

I just finished \\"Someone like you\\", and while there is so much I could say, I'd rather just say this:<br />Every topic in the story of Halley Cooke's coming of age is covered in a vast array of novels for the genre. It is Dessen's approach and style that make it her own. Everything flows like a smooth brook of crystal clear water.  She sucks you in and breathes life into all her characters.  I just want to sit and read until I finish every last page every time I read any of her books.<br />I'm just sad there were no writers like her around when I was a teenager back in the 80's.<br />Enough said.

Sarah Dessen's debut novel, \\"That Summer\\", isn't her best achievement but it shows true hope and promise of her rising YA author stardom.<br />However, it is a coming of age story I think a lot of people, young adult and older(like, say 34) could relate to.  At some point in our lives we all have similar experiences to the main character, Haven.  She is 15, feels awkward in her own skin, and with divorced parents, an older sister who is getting married, and a best friend who's fallen in love.  After reminiscing about a summer trip, she bumps into her sister's ex, Sumner.<br />Not only is he not who Haven thinks he is, but she's not the same person by the time her sister's big day arrives.<br />I think it's best to read this before her other novels because if you go to this after reading, \\"dreamland\\", you will be sorely disappointed.<br />I didn't do this, and I loved all her other books much more immensely. Her writing gets better with each book.<br />This was a very green Dessen, but very hopeful.	2003-09-22

At least now it's Summer.<br />She is being sent to live with her oddbird Aunt Mira for the summer so her weigh loss guru of a mother can tour the world for her cause.<br />Mira lives near a beach, and Colie meets Norman, Morgan, Isabel, and other townsfolk(not all so nice) of the small beach community.  Colie decides to spend her summer waitressing with the two girls, and they befriend her.  They are a few years older and wiser, and teach her valuable lessons that she'll always have with her.  She gets a birds' eye view of how friendships work.<br />Being the cynic she has become (and you'll learn why as you read about her classmates), she is not so easy to trust and let others in.  The petals of the flower known as \\"Colie\\" open up and she blossoms into a more self assured individual as the story of her summer away from home progresses.<br />Believe in one's self and everything else will fall into place is the underlying theme of Sarah Dessen's well crafted novel.  I read this in two days!! And I'm not a teenager nor a YA. I am 34, and a teen at heart.  I think and feel many of the same feelings that Colie does through this book.  I did back when I was 15, and I could relate so well to her.<br />It's a quick read, highly entertaining, and rouses up something in all of us - wanting to be better and feeling good about ourselves.	2003-09-10

As I was perusing Amazon one night last week, I stumbled upon Carolyn Mackler's new novel, \\"The Earth, my butt, and other big round things.\\"  I took a 'look inside', and feel in love with Virginia Shreves, its' main character.<br />I've never related so well to a fictional character so vividly before.  All those feelings of no self worth or confidence came flooding back to me, and it was very real to me.<br />Chapter one has Virginia lip locked with Froggy, a boy from school who has an hour to kill before his trombone lesson.  They spend an hour in her bedroom kissing every Monday.  When his hands start roaming, she pretty much sends him packing.<br />Being overweight, Virginia feels very uncomfortable with the idea of someone of the opposite sex seeing her body.  She doesn't even look in the mirror, at least not yet.<br />I am not one to give much away in my reviews.  I will tell you that you will laugh alot, most likely cry(i did), smile, and just love reading it.  I am very happy I bought my own copy.<br />As Virginia's story progresses and the 'perfect' shell of a family shatters, she is transformed.  I loved this 'coming of age story'....	2003-09-05

I highly recommend this as a purchase.<br />Atticus Finch is the open minded lawyer and father to Jem, who is thirteen yrs. old, and Jean Louise, or 'Scout', who is 9.<br />Harper lee's story of the southern family and the southern ways of the 1960's is fantastically well written and to this day, in July 2003, still holds up amazingly well.  She can really tell a story!  While the \\"ways\\" of the townsfolk is to totally cast out other races and look down on them, Atticus and his bright children have open arms and open minds. This especially happens when Atticus, a defense attorney, is standing up for Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman.<br />While there is much sadness throughout, the novel as a whole is just so brightly written.  Narrated by our little friend, Scout and seen all through her eyes, we get to know her and her family and about justice.<br />I was sucked in to the world of Scout's, and was utterly blown away by all that took place.  \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a true classic. It's written for everyone and it's an awesome story told. Thank you to Harper Lee for creating this masterpiece!	2003-07-09

A local bookstore held a book signing/discussion and as a voracious reader and a fledgling writer I felt I had to be there.<br />After only reading an article about the writer and the story, I decided to buy his book.  My title up there is similar to what Jim wrote when he signed my book.  The author himself seems very nice, down to earth, and a writer who just loves to write.  I learned a lot sitting there listening to Jim talk about his experiences in his effort to have the book published.<br />I loved this book because it drew me in and I didn't want to put it down.  I wanted to know the main character more and more, and I related to him so well.  He overdoses on nostalgia, and he could have easily been a real person.<br />Another reason I liked this so much is all the references to Boston, and other Massachusetts pop culture references.  It is nice to read about things that are so close to home for me.  That is a rare thing.<br />&quot;Looking for Wes Carroll&quot; is an easy to read and follow novel about the very down to earth and likable Max Clark.  Max lives in Quincy, Massachusetts.  His best friend since the beginning of college, Peter Sullivan, has his own life falling down a sprial staircase, and Max, being the good buddy that he always was to all his college friends, tries to aid Peter back to health.<br />I don't want to say too much about what goes on.  Max is a wonderfully written character that you will hate saying good bye to.  I am glad I bought this so I can go back and visit.<br />This is a very well written story, sad at times,(I cried several times), and has it's happier moments as well.  A lot like life itself, &quot;Looking for Wes Carroll&quot; is a novel about living, enjoying life, remembering our good times in life, road trips, and moving on and looking ahead to a bright future.<br />I highly recommend reading this, especially to readers from the same area as me.me area as me.	2003-05-26

While reading I couldn't help but be reminded of one of my all time dramatic/comedy shows, &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;.  That made me like this book all the more.<br />Also, I thought the character of Nathan Active, the state trooper who becomes suspicious of two deaths and investigates them much further, was one of the best character's I read.  Trooper Activ is born to a Native Alaskan woamn, but raised by a white couple.  He is a single man, probably in his late 30's early 40's, cynical, witty in a dry off putting way, and just an amazingly well written character.  I totally appreciated everything he said and I could easily see that character being brought to life on film because he is so vivid.<br />Once he hears of some strange and illegal goings on at the mine called &quot;The Grey Wolf&quot;, he is moreso even more leery.  He does everything in his power to find out what has really happened and why.<br />I got put off of mysteries after attempting to read the terrible writings of Sue Grafton, but my friend, Diana, gave Stan Jones such high regard, I knew I had to try it.  I am very happy I did.  I've always been a fan of the genre, and this book was  unique and very well written.  It has very interesting characters, and paints a beautiful picture of Alaska.<br />In the beginning of the book there is a page of terms used by the Native folk.  Thank you for this Mr. Jones.

After awhile I started to get to know each character and see the way he'd written it to all come out together as one.<br />Instead of going into detail about each, I will simply say this.

I am the latter, and I thought this was a fantastic story.  Born with the name Tulip, Hope is one of the best teenaged characters I've had the pleasure to read.  At 12 yrs. old, she legally changes her name to Hope, which suits her perfectly.  She is hope, she is beautiful, simple, and a truly good person.<br />At 17 yrs. old, she is already an experienced waitress. She is being raised by Addie. Her own mother abandoned her, but she does periodically appear in Hope's life, much to the teen's chagrin.  She does not know her father.<br />Addie is a feisty broad who is a cook -- They are a team, and they move to Wisconsin to work for G.T. Stoop at his diner \\"Welcome Stairways\\".  What a great name for a restaurant!  You can picture every character and meal so vividly. Joan Bauer is great at making you visualize everything going on with her descriptive writing.<br />The town is in the midst of an election, and Hope gets involved in the politics.  She comes to find out a lot of shady things about the current mayor.  When G.T. decides to run, she is his best political ally.  G.T. has leukemia, and while he his health is failing, he is full of spirit and determination.  Hope, Braverman(the short order cook), and other townsfolk all help with the campaign.  This story is unique.  Hope, in all her glory, with her great attitude and not just out to find a boyfriend or herself, is on a crusade to help G.T. with his campaign, and expose the current mayor and his ethics.<br />While her and Braverman do succomb to a romantic relationship, most of the story centers around the road to mayor, G.T.'s illness and how it affects those around him.  Also, he marries Addie and adopts Hope.  She has a father now.<br />This is a great story that is very easy to read, and it's also very heartwarming yet bittersweet.<br />It's one of the best stories I've read for the YA genre.

The character, Celia, reminded me of my \\"best friend\\" in high school. Her selfish ways and unfeeling nature towards Elizabeth are a huge reminder of how horrific my teen years were. Celia runs away more times than we care to remember and this time she's joined a circus. Quickly forgetting the friend she had in Elizabeth, she cares only about her own stupid stunts and goes so far as to steal the guy Elizabeth liked first.<br />Elizabeth, however, rises above Celia's insensitive ways and starts fresh with Christina, her new pen pal via her latest English assignment.  Unfortunately for me, my \\"Christina\\" never happened back in the day, but I do currently have a similar relationship with an email pen pal I've met.  It's great that these are real letters and that Moriarty hasn't succombed to the technology of email. It keeps true perspective in this letter format story.<br />Does Elizabeth really \\"feel sorry\\" for Celia?  If she does, she is a fool. Christina becomes Eliz's best bud and they stick together like true friends should in all the chaos around them in this quirky turn of the Young adult form.<br />I see myself in Elizabeth in so many ways, just wanting a truly best friend, and never really felt like I had it.  Meeting someone via mail is a real way to get to know someone on a whole new level.  Christina and her are meant to be friends. Too bad things didn't turn out this good for me.<br />I finished this book in a few days, and had basically read it because I am an aspiring YA novelist. I have only read YA novels lately, and some are extremely better than any other novel I've read lately.

Plus, this book is probably better than any of the books for teenaged girls at that time.  I can't really remember there being an author like Megan McCafferty. She has a full grasp of a teenager's world.  For myself, reading Jessica Darling's innermost feelings and thoughts was like reading my own high school diary(which is the form in which this is written).  Full of self loathing and teen angst, I identified with the character so deeply that I did not want this story to end.<br />Jessica is a sophomore, and her best friend, Hope, moves away.  She is heart broken. Not only that but her only sister is 11 yrs. older and engaged, soon to be wed.  She also hangs around with a crowd that she really doesn't want to hang with.<br />She experience such extreme stress that her period disappears for an entire year.  The more I read about Jess, the more I felt myself transported back into my own high school days which were so much like hers.<br />While I wasn't a size 0 or a jock, I was in love with a senior who didn't know I existed and eventually made a fool of myself in front of him. While my friends had boyfriends, I was still utterly dateless.  And I often was depressed and wallowed in self pity.  I was not even near the top 20 percent of my class, while Jessica is extremely intelligent. I often found words that wouldn't normally come out of a teenaged girl's mouth, but McCafferty made her use words that even I, at 33, don't even use to this day.  My only quip with this story is some of the choice of words. I assume that Jessica NOTSO Darling is far more intelligent than most 15 year old girls.<br />I adored the character of Jessica Darling.  She is full of wit, and intelligence.  I also fell in love with the character Marcus, he is as well developed character as Jess.  Their relationship is a very unique one, and I was not disappointed in the end like some of the other reviewers were.  There is something to really look forward to in the sequel!<br />McCafferty is an extremely gifted writer who speaks volumes.<br />I read this book because I am a struggling YA writer who wants to study her craft.<br />So far the best writers of this genre that I have had the extremem pleasuer to read are Sarah Dessen and Megan McCafferty.  I am highly anticpating &quot;Second Helpings.&quot;  I took this one out of the library, but will buy this and the sequel.o really look forward to in the sequel!  <BR>McCafferty is an extremely gifted writer who speaks volumes.  <BR>I read this book because I am a struggling YA writer who wants to study her craft.  <BR>So far the best writers of this genre that I have had the extremem pleasuer to read are Sarah Dessen and Megan McCafferty.

(Robin Hudson Mysteries)	Books	5	10	11	N	N	Sparkle is so sparkly and spunky!	\\"Fifteen thousand cabbies in New York, and I have to get the one who speaks English.  I took down his medallion number. I don't know why.  What was I going to do? Complain? Yes, Mr. Singh insisted on driving safely and being charming and wise.  See that it doesn't happen again.\\"<br />This is Robin Hudson's mind, her thoughts and inner most feelings all laid out on a cab ride in which she just wants to get to where she wants to go.  Also, this quote from \\"What's a girl gotta do\\" was one that had me literally cracking up with laughter.  She is a witty woman, that Sparkle.<br />The story is told all in first person by Robin Hudson.  She's quick witted, honest and a totally red hot dame.  This dame is also a reporter/journalist who has lost credibility in her field due to some antics. Like, belching into the mike(not knowing it would carry so far) at a press conference.  She also asked someone what human meat tasted like.  This is a girl who has nothing holding her back.  Along side is her impending divorce.  With these two strikes against her, she goes full throttle into the investigation of the murder of Griff, a private eye who had some personal information on not only Robin but a few other employees of ANN (ALL NEWS NETWORK) Otherwise known as Robin's place of work.<br />Griff is found murdered at the Marafles Hotel, on New Year's Eve.  This is after he meets face to face with Robin on the dance floor at her work party. He tells her to come up to his room to retrieve this \\"information\\"  Before she can meet him, he is found dead, apparently murdered.  Robin becomes a suspect.  She spends most of her time trying to prove she is innocent and find out who the real killer is.  Keeping up with the frenetic pace, Robin goes about her life as normally as she can. She is working on a sperm bank scandal for the news, and is also trying to solve Griff's murder.  Eventually another murder happens..no not our dear Robin.  We need her to keep the story going, and she does it so well.  A great face paced story that will make you laugh.  I think Robin is a character many women will relate to very well.  She's got strength, determination, and will not give up.  A true woman of the 90's!  Even though she does look like Rita Hayworth.<br />This debut novel of Sparkle Hayter is a murder mystery/comedy/behind the scenes of t.v. news type story.  She seems like an extremely intelligent woman yet also close to comedic genius.  I like how she writes. She knows how to blend comedy in with a good story, and she knows how to \\"hook\\" the reader.  When I read both this and \\"Naked Brunch\\" I was immersed into a world of Sparkle's world that I didn't want to leave.  I instantly fell in love with her writing when I read \\"Naked Brunch\\", which I read before this one.  It's not empty mindless fun, like I said Sparkle is a smart chick.  She has had some experience in the field of journalism and is also a sometime stand up comic.  Smart, sassy, and Witty is how I describe her.<br />This is the first of five Robin Hudson mysteries.  I don't usually make it a habit of reading series books, but that habit is about to start.l.  A great face paced story that will make you laugh.

For a long book like this, he actually sits still and is mesmerized by the pictures and that Cat in his Hat.  Dr. Seuss was pure genius in the craft of writing for young children and there are scores of generations that appreciate his works.<br />Simple words, rhyming times, and eye catching antics of the cat are all the ingredients to what makes this story work.  He's come back to visit the children from the first story, and proceeds to make a giant mess.<br />We meet little cats A through Z, who are just as cute as can be.  Then something called VOOM makes everything right.  yes, it does.  Then Mommy says goodnight. There is something about reviewing Dr. Seuss, that just makes me want to rhyme.<br />This is a great addition to your child's collection of books for years to come!	2003-01-30

I had a hard time getting into it, and just forced myself to continue reading JK's supposed masterpiece.<BR>There is no real plot, it's about some selfish, slacker types that travel around the country looking for the next best thing.<BR>The narrator, Sal Paradise, is the exception.  Supposedly, Dean Moriarty is based on Neal Cassidy, JK's real life side kick.  I know and am unfortunately related to people like this guy..not a selfless bone in his body.  What is too like?  JK's annoying style of mindless chit chat that just seems to make almost no sense.  I abhor the fact that there is no use of correct grammar here.  I guess this is what it takes to create a literary classic.<BR>1.  Use little or no grammar rules<BR>2.  Create characters that people just want to smack around<BR>3.  Have no plot, and just aimlessly spew out words that make<BR>    no sense.<br />It's your decision.  It took me a long time to get through this and feel I wasted so much of it.

US	48296265	RE5WBLEW82Y6K	0142300675	86018573	Dreamland	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Dessen is an amazing writer!	Despite the fact that I am not a teenager, who this book is more aimed at, I loved it!  I had found it relatively cheap, and thought I'd buy it instead of getting it out of the library.  I am a fledgling writer of YA stories, and I had done some homework on the writers. Sarah Dessen is considered to be a highly respected writer in this field, and I can see why.  \\"Dreamland\\" was a incredibly good story about an impending senior, Caitlin O'Koren, and how her life changes after her \\"perfect\\" sister, Cass, leaves without saying anything to the family.  You see how this affects the entire family.  Caitlin<br />then meets Rogerson, a very intriguing character who I right away, liked.  It was almost too easy, but as the story progresses we learn some dark secrets about him that do not make him a likable character, but you can't help but feel sorry for him.<br />One thing, as a parent, that I learned is that parents can often not even know their own teenaged children.  I have discovered that it's truly important to have an open and honest relationship with your teenagers, at least as much as you can.  The parents in the story are so far away, and don't have a clue about what is really going on as they are too busy with their own lives and also many parents have far too high expectations of their teens as well.  Teenagers are people, but they are going through an extremely unique period in life. Caitlin really came to life for me,. This is an extremely well told tale of a teenager's life as she embarks on a journey of self discovery while dealing with losing her sister and being abused by her boyfriend.<br />It's worth buying!! Dessen is a true visionary in the YA lit. world. I hope I can be that good a writer someday.	2002-11-15
US	48296265	R18LCCDTXTCIJJ	0451458583	483135927	Threshold	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Greating writing but weak in some spots	With the October/Halloween theme blowing through, I decided to search for a current addition to the horror genre.  This book looked different from the usual ghost/vampire story. One thing I have to say about this book is I almost stopped reading it because nothing was happening. Sure, she can write, she is an amazing writer and does so with great ease.  I was very impressed with Caitlin Kiernan's style, however, the first half of this book is really boring. Also, the characters weren't exactly the most likable people. Why should we even care what happens to them? Chance Matthews, a student and rock genuis, is the main character.  The first chapter has Chance, her boyfriend, Deke, and there other friend, Elise in this underground tunnel, and they are getting stoned.<br />The rumor has it that there is something beyond this wall, something evil that could get out and kill, but just what is it?<br />Well, Elise gets killed by whatever is out there and Chance and Deke spend the rest of the story trying to figure it all out.<br />They break up and Deacon's new girlfriend, Sadie, comes in to the story. This is the only character with any true goodness. When a teenage girl, Dancy(gotta love these names), gets involved in the whole scheme of where the horror starts, Sadie takes the girl under her wing.  She grows to care, while the rest of them are just trying to stay alive.<br />There is a trilobite(you can find out the meaning of that at the back of the book) named dicranurus, this is the evil of the story. The dark side, the bad guy.  It seems that this rock like fossil/creature, takes on somewhat human form, and terrorizes the characters.<br />About half way through the book, where I almost put it down cuz of the slowness and lameness, is where things started getting interesting.  A bit spooky. I had nightmares every night I read this book after this point.  Definitely worth picking up, if you don't mind the slow start.  Kiernan is an amazing writer who has a great passion for the subjects chosen in the story.<br />I don't recommend you buy it though. I got it out of the library and paid an overdue fee.<br />Worth a look just to feast your eyes on some of the best writing I've read thus far.or the subjects chosen in the story.<BR>I don't recommend you buy it though.

I didn't even know about this book until I saw that my husband had picked it up at the bookstore.  This book is illustrated by a different artist, Felicia Bond, and her work is sweet and uncomplicated.  The story has that same rhythm and beat you follow when reading poetry, but it is also gives a peaceful feeling to it's readers(and the ones being read to).<br />It's a day in the life of kind of story about animals on a farm, while the children are gone.  It is a perfect addition to any child's book shelf and makes for a perfect bedtime story with it's calming effect.<br />I highly recommend buying this for toddlers! If you already have any of Brown's other books, this one will be a welcome addition.	2002-10-19

The drawings are very childlike and the colors(mostly primary)are perfect.  This is the story of a zookeeper who is closing the zoo for the night, and while he says \\"goodnight\\" to each critter, the gorilla, who is first, steals his keys and lets all the animals out.  They all follow him home, and he never even notices!  His pop eyed wife has to take care of them herself.  It's the most adorable little book!  There isn't much to read. It's more of a feast for the child's eyes right before he sets off to night nights.<br />The copy I have is a small board book, and it's small enough for my son's little hands to hold and admire all by himself.<br />I highly recommend buying this for the child at age 21 month and over.	2002-10-19

She knows how to blend equally interesting dialogue and comedic moments in this story of Annie Engel, who finds out that she is a werewolf. She also finds out there are others out there in the city just like her.  She is diagnosed by a crazy broken hearted psychiatrist, Marco Potenza, who is also a werewolf, as having Lycanthropic Metamorphic Disorder(LMD), which is just a fancy schmanzy term for being a werewolf.  He brings her into his clinic where he helps others like her to live in peace with this unusual disorder.  Annie is the first female of their kind to stay since the days of Sarah, the woman who broke Marco's heart.  He is after Sarah's ex, Jim, since him and his wife, Carol, found out that Jim had faked his own death after Sarah's mysterious death.<br />Marco comes from a family of werewolves whose main preoccupation is to help the creatures like them live in harmony with being the kind of person they are.  They can't help it, it's genetic!<br />Annie meets all sorts of interesting characters that help to keep the frantic pace of this comical and unique story of the \\"last nice girl in the city\\" turning into a werewolf.<br />There are so many characters introduced, one can get confused, but every one of these people has some signifigance to the story as it unfolds.<br />Werewolves in this story only kill bad people, so you can't help but side with the wolves, and you want to see them survive the chase of Marco and his team.  Marco's wife Carol is the savior to that group.  She is a wonderful character in this myriad of cast of characters.<br />Jim is the werewolf that Annie eventually falls in love with, and they have quite an adventure together living on the run and eventually running to live.<br />Sparkle Hayter has a truly unique vision into this work of fiction. It is one of the most well written stories I have read in my entire life of reading fiction. She knows how to keep the pace up, keep the reader fascinated with what is happening, and makes us laugh, almost in spite at times.<br />I highly recommend this!!cinated with what is happening, and makes us laugh, almost in spite at times.<br />I highly recommend this!!	2002-09-23

As a fan of MM, I used to buy a lot of books on her, which were all pretty redundant.  This was a great diversion.  It is a collection of writings from other publications and some strictly for the book itself and also the author, Yona Zeldis McDonough's, insights and thoughts on MM.<br />It is interesting to read what other people think, and some of these writers are quite well known -- Joyce Carol Oates, Gloria Steinhem, Marge Piercy,. These essays show Marilyn in a positive and worst possible light. -- Every little available, hence the title, \\"All the Available Light\\".  I think this book needs to be read with an extreme open mind by the fans.<br />As a woman who truly loves and is a fan of Monroe, I got the feeling that woman writers here are not fans.  They stepped up on their soapbox and tore Marilyn into pieces because of her overt sexuality and the fact that she appeared to be the dumb blonde.  They seemed almost intimidated and resorted to stupid remarks about her intelligence.  No one truly knew Marilyn, she was and still is an enigma.  We can only form opinions, which is what this little blurb of writing really is. Every opinion you can think of is here.  There are some facts thrown in for good measure, and the author ends it with a \\"Chronology\\"  From this, we find out that the author thinks MM was murdered.<br />Even though Marilyn didn't particularly like Sir Lawrence Olivier, I thought his chapter was one of the best ones.  He was her leading man in \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\". After speaking rather bluntly about his sometimes frustrating experience working with her, he realizes in retrospect that in the finished product, she was brilliant and quite beautiful.<br />Which is my own opinion as well. So, I'm biased, I'll admit that.<br />A lot of this book was very boring and read like text book material with the contributors making up their own words like Monroeivitiy and Monroean.  Please...<br />I don't highly recommend this book, but it is an interesting peek into other people's minds and how Marilyn affected them in both their personal and professional lives.mend this book, but it is an interesting peek into other people's minds and how Marilyn affected them in both their personal and professional lives.	2002-08-29

I was literally hooked by Susie Salmon's story before I even had my hands on the book.  I had read an interview with the author, and thought that the book sounded unique. I then read some of it here at Amazon, and had to buy it.<br />This book is definitely worth purchasing.  Susie is raped and murdered by creepy neighbor, George Harvey.  Looking down from Heaven and into the family and friends left behind, she narrates the entire story.<br />Characters in the book are all drawn out so well. You feel as if you really know them.<br />This is a story about redemption.  It is extremely well told. Sebold has a true talent for originality and prose.<br />I will never forget this book, and will probably read it again.<br />I will lend it out to everyone I know that would appreciate this innovative and moving story.<br />My only complaint is that I think some words were too big for a 14 year old to pull off. I often thought: Would this girl really say that? I'm in my 30's and had to use a thesaurus to read this book.

US	48296265	RDO9DGGZAAILC	0743436210	692650386	Hearts in Atlantis	Books	4	2	3	N	N	The rebirth of a King fan	I had really lost all hope of ever reading another Stephen King book after trying to attempt reading \\"Dolores Claiborne\\", which was the worst of his.<br />Well, some ten odd years later, I picked up \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" at a yard sale. I had heard it was a good book, and that the movie was great. I always have to read the book before seeing the movie, so opted for the written page.<br />It was awesome.<br />\\"Hearts....\\" is a book broken down into five separate stories that all have a connection is some form. The first story \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" is the longest and best of the group. It is set in the Summer of 1960, Bobby Garfield, Carol Gerber, and Sully John are all 11 yrs. old and enjoying their youth in adventurous ways.  Enter Ted Brautigan, who is an older man.  He takes a room in the house that Bobby and his not so nice mother live in.  He becomes Bobby's father figure, and the boy becomes emotionally attached to Ted much to his mother's chagrin.<br />He askes Bobby to read to him, pays the kid for it, and thus they begins their bonding.<br />It is extremely well written and the characters just burst with life. I felt as if I really knew Bobby, who was my favorite character in the book. I am glad that this story dominates the pages of this thick novel because it is the best work of fiction here as it's the most endearing.<br />The four stories left, \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\", \\"We Were in Vietnam\\", \\"Blind Willie\\", \\"Heavnely shades of Night falling\\" all have a character in them that appeared in \\"Low Men\\". This is the connection of them all. In some stories, they are older, and the men have seen the horrors of Vietnam, and they have all had the war effect them in some way. Carol becomes a protestor in \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\", which is set at a college in Maine. This was my second favorite.<br />The book certainly doesn't have much closure, as some reviewers were looking for, but I don't think that this is what King wanted with this work. He is just showing how life was in the 60's, and how the Vietnam war shaped the lives of the characters in the stories, which span from the summer of 1960 up til 1999.<br />There is a lot of sadness, humor, and realism to this piece of writing.<br />Worth reading!!! Just skip \\"Blind Willie\\" as I don't think it adds anything but just annoys.  I hated it but read the whole thing anyway.  It was annoying and boring.  We get to see how the bad kid from \\"Low Men\\" turns into a bad man basically.<br />Highly recommended!!<br />Eileen Famiglietti60's, and how the Vietnam war shaped the lives of the characters in the stories, which span from the summer of 1960 up til 1999.<BR>There is a lot of sadness, humor, and realism to this piece of writing.<BR>Worth reading!!!

US	48296265	R2YNFNZFA7B2MR	0060207655	387203276	The Runaway Bunny	Books	3	6	11	N	N	Not as good as "Goodnight Moon"	which is also written by Margaret Wise Brown, and also illustrated by Clement Hurd.  The drawing of the bunny is similar to Goodnight Moon's illustration, but the rest of the artwork is different.<br />Like a few of the other reviewers here, my only recollection of this tale is from seeing the film, \\"Wit\\" where the story is read to a woman dying of cancer. She is comforted by it, and I was brought literally to tears. It is a moving story, but it is certainly not as baby friendly as \\"Moon\\" is.  I found the story itself so endearing, but mixed with the illustration, it is a little freaky and not pleasing to the eye. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" has much brighter colors, more of a primary color base,  and easier on the eyes and mind.<br />Also, when I read this to my 1 1/2 yr old. for the first time, he was not the least bit interested in the pictures or story.  He took off running.  He has loved \\"Moon\\" since he was 10 months old, and never tires of it. I think it is more of a toddler book than this one is.<br />This is more for children between 3 - 5 years old, so long as the pictures don't frighten them.<br />I bought this for really cheap at a yard sale, and am glad I did. It was a bit disappointing since both my son and I had loved \\"Goodnight Moon\\" so much.<br />From the reviews I have read here, this story sends mixed messages.  The message of the story is that a mother's love is unconditional. This was written in a different time, and I think there is a lot of fear driven into society lately.<br />Plus, I can see how people can have that sense of the story with the creepy pictures. I'm sure the writer was trying to show the love a mother has for her child. It is not intended to scare anyone.  It is a timeless story that will tug at your heartstrings.  It's very moving to see the love a mother has for her child.<br />I recommend it for it's story content.  Be weary of the illustrations as they are bound to sway your opinion of the story itself.	2002-07-12

It was certainly descriptive, even if I could have cared less about the characters.  Also, the writer doesn't write her characters to be likable.  So just what is her point?<br />I tried to read it again, and totally didn't like Kingsolver's style of writing. She is boring!  Also, she just tries to use big words to make up for lack of talent.

She is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. This is some of the best writing I've read in my entire life.  It is easy to follow, very descriptive about it's characters and everything that evolves around them. She knows how to make a story funny and touching at the same time. Also, this story kept me glued.  It was hard to put down as I was having such a good time reading it.<br />It's about a family, well, mostly it's about, Mattie Gifford, the mother of &quot;Sonny&quot;, of the title.  To grab the attention of his estranged wife, Sonny kidnaps two women and a dog and holds them hostage in a trailer park. Sonny isn't your usual criminal.  He seems like a happy go lucky guy, that just can't get it together. Now he has gone and lost it, really lost it. Although, you can't help but love this character.<br />Mattie also has three adult daughters that drive her crazy.  Even though she doesn't seem to have the same close bond with her daughters as she does with her criminal son, Sonny, you see that there is love in this family unit.  Extended family, and Mattie's dead husband, Lester are more characters that come bounding from the story.<br />This is a writer who knows how to write great characters with strength and integrity.  There are so many tender momments sprinkled throughout the story that bring laughter to the lips and tears to the eyes.<br />The story starts when the crime happens, and follows the family throughout the next few days.  It is a great story about relationships and how they evolve when tragedy strikes.  Mattie is a character that I can sympathize with, and I admire for the changes she goes through in the story's outcome.<br />The book reminded me a bit of &quot;Divine Sisters of the Ya Ya&quot;, in the sense of the family relationships and the humour. Although, I think that Pelletier is the better writer.  She is simply divine, and so is this story.<br />I am highly recommending this one, it's a good one!is simply divine, and so is this story.<BR>I am highly recommending this one, it's a good one!	2002-05-02

It seemed so cliched and Harlequin romance.  I really thought I'd never like his work.<br />I was given this book by my mother to read, and I loved it!<br />It starts off great.  It is being narrated by the main character, Landon, at ages 57 and 17.  Landon is a very likable character.  I immediately felt drawn to him, and I wanted to learn more about who he was.  Sparks did a great job of allowing us to get to know his characters.  I grew to love both Landon, and Jamie, who is the female character in the story.  They are in high school, and are both going through a lot in their senior year.  They share a lot of good and bad times together, and eventually fall in love.  It's a bittersweet story, and worth reading right to the last page.<br />This is a very quick, easy to read book, but it also tragically sad.  It is a beautiful story, and it was beautifully written by Nicholas Sparks.<br />It is not just a romantic story, but it is a coming of age story as well.  I think it would appeal to a lot of people as just a good story, even if it is very sad.  It is worth the tears.	2002-04-04

This is a lot information that I don't know about Buffett, at least the very early stuff.  We do have the albums, but who really cares about every single specific detail of every song and it's production on every single Buffett album?  I know I am probably taking this far too seriously, but when I did a few of the quizzes in the beginning of the book(I don't know the early stuff that well, I like it, but don't know who Carmen was dancing with).  I failed miserably and it just upset me.<br />I have been a fan of Buffett since I met my husband ten years ago.  I have really learned to totally appreciate his music, and he is one of my favorite musicians.  I have seen him in concert eight times!  I have a blast at the concert, and just because I failed Ryan's quizzes doesn't make me a non parrotthead.  I think he must have a lot of time on his hands to learn all these stupid little details.<br />That aside, it's interesting to learn more about THE MAN.<br />My husband bought this, not me.  I just tried to pass the quizzes and failed miserably at the first three. I gave up after that. I am a Parrotthead. I don't care what this book says!<br />I think if you've been a fan since his early days, you will do amazingly well at these trivia questions.<br />I know it's just a trivia book; I just don't think it justifies who is and isn't a real Parrothead.<br />FINS UP!	2002-03-22

It is a crime/mystery drama that was written back in 1961 by Mark McShane.  The story takes place in England.  The two main characters are Myra and Bill Savage.  They are married and live off the money Myra makes as a medium.  She holds seances at there house, hence the title which I think must have been taken from the climax scene of the story.<br />I don't want to give away to much, basically they want to get more money and quickly.  They cook up a scheme, well, mostly Myra does, to kidnap a well to do fellow's daughter.<br />Do they get caught?  One must read to find out as I will not give away too much of this very intense book.<br />The two reasons I wanted to read this is.<br />1.  The idea, while I do appreciate the crime drama/mystery from time to time. They get so formulatic after a while.  It seems as though there hasn't been many that have interested me lately.  This book has been around a while, and it seems to be very obscure.  I was surprised to see that no one else had reviewed it.  It has some excellent twists and turns in the story that keep the reader guessing as to how things will turn out.<br />2.  The price. ...  This is definitely worth much more than that!<br />McShane writes with great description of everything that goes on, and the dialogue is just divine. He really knows how to bring characters so totally alive and seem as if they are just about to jump off the page.  He knows how to keep the reader interested and gripped to the very last page.<br />There were times where I didn't want to go on with it because Myra is just so unlikable, but the plot kept me going.  Her husband, is teetering on bad himself due to the influences that Myra has on him.  Besides, while she is the brain behind the operation, Bill does all the grunt work.<br />The ending is excellent!!! Very creepy!!<br />This is worth reading!!! Plus, it is only 189 pages so it doesn't take to long to get through it.	2002-03-22

While VOTD is hardly a piece of american literature that we would've read or learned about in high school, it definitely has it's place in the history of fiction.<br />Jackie Susann was a writer that wrote with great guts and integrity, and she had a great style.  The Dialogue just flows so well!  and the characters all spring to life.  Even those characters we don't necessarily like are just as intriguing to read as say, Anne Welles.  Anne is a small town girl who moves to the big city, New York to be exact.  She is kind, bright, and sweet, maybe too sweet and kind for her own good.  She wants a better and more exciting life.<br />Down the path to that life, she meets Neely O'Hara, a struggling actress/singer/dancer who wants to make it on Broadway and will stop at nothing to reach success.  This character is hard to sympathize with, whereas Anne is totally easy to like and feel sorry for.<br />Enter Jennifer North, She is an actress that meets up with Neely and Anne as they all learn about and see the lights go up on Broadway.  Jennifer is more like Anne's personality, but has a very tough time between her family, the man she loves, Tony Polar, and his family.<br />They all become friends, and all shall i say?  creep around in the valley of the dolls.  \\"Dolls\\" being sleeping pills, pep pills, pills to help them relax...  Read and see what these dolls do to their lives and the lives of those around them.<br />This is a MUST READ book.  I can't say enough good things about it, it is captivating, easy to follow, it has great dialogue.<br />If you like stories about women friendships and stories about show business, this should interest you.<br />I have read this twice in the past six years, and I love it just as much now as I did when I was 26 yrs. old.  It's a timeless read.	2002-03-06

This story of the jolly mon, and his adventures(such as maybe Buffett himself may have or has had already) in the sea is a real treat.<br />While it is marketed for children, as a Parrotthead myself, I think all Buffett fan's could enjoy this.  He has added the lyrics to his song, Jolly Mon, in the back of the book as well.<br />Like all other stories, this has it's good guys and bad, and conflict.  I think that is the way Jimmy Buffett writes, which is so honest and down to earth.  This is as good as any song he's written, maybe even better.  I was so moved by the ending, I cried.<br />I am not going to give anything away, but this story has a great message.<br />I think this is a great addition to the library of books I am building for my children.<br />My son is only 1 year old, and while he doesn't really pay attention nor understand what I am saying.  He was entranced by the illustration.<br />The artist, Lambert Davis, did a wonderful job of capturing the characters and the places that Jolly Mon visits.<br />This is definitely worth buying!	2002-01-04

When I saw that a sequel had been written, I new I had to read it to see what had happened to the crazy Neely and the way to nice Anne.<br />&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; is one of my favorite books of all time, and this sequel certainly isn't a personal fave but it isn't entirely terrible.  They do tell us right in the front of the book that the dates and times have been changed..why? I have no idea. That part takes away one star for me.  Why did they have to do that?  I guess that was the writer's decision.  By the way, Rae Lawrence is a decent writer.  While she doesn't write in the exact same way Susann did(who ever could?), she does have a knack for dialogue.  She did a great job writing Neely's choice words.  Nothing beats the original..&quot;I AM NEEEEEELY OHARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!&quot;<br /> Technically, Anne and Neely should have been at least 15 years older than they say in the book.  Anyway, that all aside.  As long as you remember that this wasn't really written by Susann, even though you see her name on the cover of the book, and you just enjoy &quot;seeing&quot; those &quot;old Friends&quot;..as a lot of reviewers have put, this book is a decent take. I wasn't thrilled with the ending of the book.<br />I just hoped for something better.  But this isn't better.  VALLEY OF THE DOLLS is the better of the two.  For those die hard fans, of the first, you may be disappointed.  Yet, this book is good.  It kept me interested.<br />I really hope a movie is never made.  The movie of the first book is such outrageously trashy fun -- That could never be duplicated, so it should be best left alone!<br />As far as this book is concerned, I didn't love it, but it was good enough to keep me reading.<br />I won't give away too much, but if you want revisit Neely O'Hara, Anne Welles, and Lyon Burke, you just may enjoy this homage to Susann.	2002-01-04

I think a lot of girls can relate to the main character, Sammie Davis.  She faces a lot of challenges and obstacles that I think almost every teenaged girl faces.  It's sort of a fish of water/coming of age story that is wonderfully written by the new fresh voice of Carolyn Mackler.  -- What a writer!  I also read this cuz I am trying to be a writer myself and this is my genre.<br />The characters are all so real and true to life.  It's almost as if they just jump off the page and into your lap while you are reading.  I highly recommend this novel for all teen girls, and for those teens at heart.  It's the kind of story that really grabs you right away and you don't want to put it down til you are finished.<br />I got it out of the library, but I think it is worth buying.	2001-12-10

She is also the chick that rambled on in the parody hit, Valley Girl, back in the early 80s'.  That is what I think of when I see her name.<br />Now I will think about what an original and fresh voice she's added to today's literature.  While she definitely was &quot;writing what she knows&quot;(I am a fledgling writer and have heard that repeatedly), she definitely knows how to write.  Her style is unique, and she has a real flair for dialogue.  It really was well written and it was easy to follow.  It is also laugh out loud funny at times.<br />I think a lot of women will relate to the character, America Throne, who constantly makes bad choices in her men.  The story is about her rollercoaster style life of relationships, and her amnomosity towards her father.  She learns about herself, and you will enjoy the ride.  I promise....<br />When's the next book, Moon?	2001-12-05

Their father has just killed their mother, and throughout the story, we come to find out the real truths that are hidden.  and about the secrets that are kept.  It's a good look into the relationships of parents and children, and also sibling relationships as well.<br />I was hooked from the first page, and read the second half in one sitting!! I didn't want to move until I finished it.  I think Lester has a great vision for teens' emotions.  While you could definitely tell it was an adult who wrote the book, I thought he did an outstanding job being the voice of both a teenage girl and boy in the same story.  He knows how to get the reader hooked, and keep them interested.  Considering the attention span of teenagers, this is a good quality for a book.  and it's not too long.  I am an adult, 32 years old, and I really thought this was a very interesting tale, and I thought he told it beautifully.  he's a good writer.  I hope I can be that good one day.	2001-11-06

She is growing up, but she still has her adventures with Diana, and her other friends.<br />There are a few new characters are introduced, and although you don't instantly fall in love with them like Ann, they grow you.  All but Davey, this character was just so annoying.  THis boy was just a bad apple.<br />I'm sure LM had good intentions, but I was utterly annoyed and it brought my feeling of the book down a bit.<br />IF you loved the first book, you will probably enjoy this as well.  There is a long series of books by LM.  I am currently on break from reading her.<br />She was a great writer, able to bring a great deal of sense of humor in her storytelling, and she is very descriptive.  She really brings the characters so true to life, especially Anne.<br />I do recommend this despite my problem w/ davey.<br />Anne will always remain forever in my heart as a true heroine of classic literature. One of the best character to ever be put on paper..as she is kind, funny, good spirited, and what an imagination!	2001-10-25
US	48296265	R1LH9B817NO2D6	1560974273	582435172	Ghost World	Books	4	1	2	N	N	as good as comics get	I'll admit the only reason I wanted to read this was because I had already seen the movie, which was excellent.  I have to say that this probably the best comic I have ever read.  Of course, my comic reading days were limited to Archie comics, and it's been a long time since I read those.  The characters were all so funny and realistic.  I can't help but relate to Enid as I felt alienated and alone also at that age.<br />This is worth a look at if you like comics of all kinds.  Thumbs way up!	2001-10-11
US	48296265	R1IFY45PGMGYYM	1556111797	462775258	Mmii: The Return of Marilyn Monroe	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Much better than &quot;BLONDE&quot;	I bought this book about ten years ago for $1.99.  As a Marilyn fan, I was curious and thought it was a good addition to my collection.  I finally read it, and I really liked it.  Despite the other review here, I found it to be very entertaining, and it was interesting to discover &quot;what if&quot;.  While Staggs isn't Hemingway or Shakespeare, I think he is a very good writer.  He is good with words and is very descriptive and has a knack for dialogue.  It was a very interesting interpetation of MM's life had she not died.  There have been a few other writers who tried to do the same thing.  The two I have read are Marilyn's Daughter, which I liked as much as this one.  Although, I don't remember it that well.  But I would have remembered it if I didn't like it.  Speaking of not liking, Blonde, by Joyce Carol Oates is the other book that displays MM in a fictious way.  I didn't even finish that one as I did not enjoy it at all.  This book starts with MM at the end of her Hollywood career and instead of her dying another woman takes her place.  Everyone thinks it is her, and in the eyes of most of the world, MM is dead.  but she is kidnapped and taken &quot;underground&quot;, eventually she runs away from her captors.  She lives her life under a different name, and meets alot of interesting characters along the way to a different kind of success. I would recommend this book for both MM fans and anyone just looking for something a little different. It is a great book.	2001-03-30
