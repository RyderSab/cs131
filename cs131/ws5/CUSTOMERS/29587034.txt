This is unfortunate because the premise of \\"Flyboys\\" should have made for an excellent and interesting read. Instead, Bradley ruined what would have been mostly the stories of airmen and pilots shot down over Chi Chi Jima by turning into a rant against strategic bombing, American history, and the Western world in general prior to World War II. The author seeks to almost justify the scale of Japanese brutality and attrocities by pointing out utterly incomparable actions by the United States. Don't waste your money on this trash.	2005-08-27
US	29587034	R3AE519HLT4JFC	019516895X	345581260	Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Very Good	I found McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom to be a great history not only of the Civil War, but also, as the cover suggests, the Civil War Era (includes years preceding the war). McPherson does an excellent job of plainly explaining the events that led to this bloody conflict, its causes,not to mention the war itself. It also does well detailing the great ramifications that resulted from the war, from the rise of free labor capitalism in the U.S. as well as the shaping of the modern political parties. The only problems I had with the book were the maps, which tended to contain too much information per map, and the footnotes, which became somewhat annoying. Otherwise, recommended to anyone wishing to study the Civil War Era.	2005-01-04

The chapters are well organized , easily read, and brutally honest on the truths of modern war as it is today and will be in the future. Dunnigan delves not only into tactis and strategy, but also other, often overlooked details of war in the modern world. Among these topics are morale of soldiers, training, equipment and technology, and logistics. Recommended for any student of warfare and current global issues.	2004-12-25

It is not, but that doesn't make it a bad book either. To the contrary, I found this book provided good info on the various special operations forces it covered. I too was disappointed though to find Delta was not covered in this book. And the fact that the Pentagon still doesn't acknowledge them is a joke, everyone knows they exist, and there's plenty of pictures available of them and their gear so thats no excuse to exclude them. The author's portayal of those branches covered however was very good, making this book a mixed bag rating-wise.	2004-12-25

Like many Pacific battles, this one was fought in some of the worst conditions imaginable, which were over come by sheer grit and fortitude. This is the story of how Americans and Japanese fought tooth and nail, literally (in the Japanese case at least) to the last man to control a miserable south Pacific island called Guadalcanal. Deriving from extensive research including then-recently de-classified documents, Frank has produced the greatest work yet on the landmark battle that raged from August 1942 to February 1943 and changed the course of the war in the Pacific. Highly recommended.	2004-12-25

On the positive side, it provides a very thorough and detailed account of Lindbergh's life, and is in no way boring like some biographies. However, I am not sure whether to trust this author's objectivity. Berg drew heavily from the Lindbergh family itself for his sources, and although a viable source, he relied to heavily on it. This gives the book the tendency to be slightly and in some case grossly biased towards its view of Lindbergh's actions. Although his exploits in flying were in every way brave, his actions and words regarding American involvement in the 2nd World War and his view of Nazi Germany reflect very porrly on his judgment. He also seemed somewhat indifferent to attrocities committed by the Axis nations. Read the book, but keep an open mind to the subject.	2004-05-17

Frank's research into the planned invasion of Japan is fantastic, and provides the greatest insight I've ever read into the subject. Beginning with the American fire bombings of Japan, the book goes on to study the American and Japanese military and dilpomatic policies that led to the Atomic bombings and the end of the war. A magnificent account covering both sides of the subject, Downfall does well to answer the question over the use of atomic weapons and bringing the end of the war.	2004-05-17

Whether or not China does participate in global subversion of the Unites States I'm not certain. What can't be denied is that China has been fairly successful in recetn years in its intelligence operations in the U.S. Gertz writes of what he believes is a larger Chinese strategy to undermine the U.S. and often blames the Clinton administration for China's success at doing this. Chronicaling such actions as attempted Chinese business take over of the Panama Canal, Gertz makes an interesting argument that should probably be further researched. he does provide interesting documents in the apendix that are worth looking over.	2004-05-10

Not only is it very detailed for a somewhat small book, it also covers the German plan of attack and operation very well despite the subject being primarily the reaction of the Third army.

I myself found that one of my own family members took part in the cable tapping of a Soviet Naval base and I never even knew it until I read the book!

I found it to be somewhat disappointing. Overall, the book's coverage of American aircraft is fairly decent, and extremely detailed. However, when it comes to discussing more recent American projects, including stealth aircraft, the book does poorly. The chapters covering these are too short and need to be updated like the chapters on less modern American aircraft. Another problem is the book's coverage of foreign war planes. These sections of the book seem to suffer from the same problems as the sections on American stealth, along with having poor photographs of Soviet era and Russian aircraft. Overall, the book is an OK refference for Gulf War era American warplanes, but badly needs updating on its other topics.	2004-05-09

What's funny is that nobody will be reading this review, but I'm writing it anyway. I bought a copy of this version of the book at an airport book store after having been to the Air and Space Museum a few times. I found the book provided a good guide for the time in which it was written, and has good photographs. Obviously however, one should not rely on this version of the book as a guide to the Air and Space Museum in its current form. Therefore, instead of recommending you read this book, I recommend you visit the actual museum.	2004-05-09

The technology detailed in the book as well as the history of American hypersonic aircraft is amazing, and the perfomance qualities of such aircraft are equally amazing. At the same time, the book isn't too long and doesn't require too much reading time on a subject some people may find too boring to be made into a long book. I may, however, disagree with the author's view of the idea of the government keeping Top Secret aircraft under a cloak of secrecy. Keeping these types of aircraft and their technology secret , in my opinion, is beneficial to the nation's defense and national security. I recommend this book to anyone interested in hypersonic aircraft and technology, as well as those intrigued by the mysterious &quot;Aurora&quot; spyplane.	2004-05-09

Andrew does well in explaining not only the great successes and failures of the KGB, but also how it became the ultimate symbol of Communist Russia and tool of the totalitarian state.

Otherwise, a good read and recommendedfor anyone wishing to learn more about the rise and fall of the Soviet state.	2004-05-09
