US	52917715	RO1WAOR8NABLN	0060934417	546555129	Bel Canto	Books	5	13	15	N	N	A thoughtful and lyrical piece of contemporary fiction	Bel Canto sat on my shelf for quite some time before I picked it up -- as others have written here, I was hesitant to pick up a novel whose plot revolved around opera and terrorists. But after two of my friends raved to me about how good it was, I decided to give it a try, and inhaled it in a matter of days. Though the book's plot does indeed center around terrorists taking hostage a dinner party which includes a world-renowned opera singer, Bel Canto isn't really about opera and terrorists. It's about the way human beings relate to one another in the most fundamental of ways, whether or not they speak the same language or have anything in common.<br />Ms. Patchett writes beautifully as she tells the story of foreign dignitaries who are forced to coexist with the terrorists who have taken them hostage. Though I am largely ignorant of opera, I was still able to appreciate the role which music played in the novel, that of a universal language which gave the hostages and terrorists their first commonality. Many others follow, but I'm hesitant to reveal any plot details (I also don't consider a plot summary to be a book review). It will suffice to say that the relationships among the hostages and terrorists grow more complex as the book continues, and what was once a black and white situation quickly changes to shades of gray.<br />If I were to have one quibble with the novel it would have to be the epilogue which, I felt, was somewhat forced and not entirely believable. I see that other readers have felt the same way -- I suppose it's a matter of personal preference of how tidily a reader likes his or her book to end. In any case, the epilogue in no way detracted from my enjoyment of Bel Canto overall. I only wish I hadn't left it sitting on my shelf for so long, distracted by preconceived notions. Don't make the same mistake -- if you're a fan of thoughtful and well-crafted contemporary fiction, read this book!	2002-09-14

Using her intelligence as well as her beauty, Agnes makes a life for herself in South Africa from almost nothing. She is a flawed protagonist, at times selfish and foolish, but the novel is enriched by Agnes' imperfections. The Mirror speaks eloquently of a woman's struggle between family and self, between convention and desire. In a way, the book leaves one sad at its conclusion -- it's not as much an escape from reality as it is a reflection of the sometimes unattractive side of human relationships. A thoughtful and provocative read.	2002-04-29

Behind the Scenes at the Museum has all the makings of a phenomenal book -- a little bit of mystery, humor, intriguing characters, and an enjoyable writing style. The novel is, in theory, a catalog of the life of Ruby Lennox from birth to middle age, but Ms. Atkinson manages to include the history of Ruby's mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother through her clever &quot;footnotes.&quot; I would disagree with those reviewers who refer to the book as being about a &quot;dysfunctional family&quot;; it's more of a chronicle of four generations of women, all distinct entities who struggle with similar problems of family and self. Behind the Scenes at the Museum examines what it means to be a mother, a daughter, and a sister, as well as leading the reader through half of the 20th century. I can't wait to get my hands on more books by Ms. Atkinson -- I've been recommending this one to everyone! It's a pure pleasure to read.	2002-04-29

Every now and then there's nothing better than a re-read of a childhood favorite, or, as in the case of Sloppy Firsts, the discovery of something new and wonderful. Quite truthfully, I expected Sloppy Firsts to be nothing more than a pleasant romp. I was surprised to find that though the book was immensely easy to read, it was also thoughtful and substantive. Ms. McCafferty manages to touch on so many of the universal strains and pains of adolescence; it seems like one would be hard pressed to find a woman or girl who can't in some small (or large!) way relate to the misunderstood Jessica Darling. If I had to criticize the book in any way, it would perhaps be that it's _too_ perceptive and well-written. As the novel is written as excerpts from Jessica's diary, it's a bit of a stretch to believe that a high-school sophomore would be quite so eloquent and insightful. That tiny little peeve aside, I highly recommend Sloppy Firsts to anyone who has ever been a teenage girl.	2002-04-29

I do read a bit of fantasy, but Veronica is different in that the plot is grounded very firmly in New York City. It's what happens in the city to Leo, an innocent bystander who gets caught up in a whirlwind of magic and time-travel, that's the fantastic part. Though I found the novel to be innovative and the plot intriguing, I found Mr. Cristopher's writing style a bit repetitive and forced. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who might be wanting to read it, but the ending leaves one wondering what exactly happened to Veronica and Leo -- it's one of those endings I'm dying to discuss with someone else who's read the book. A fun, yet thoughtful, escape from reality.	2002-03-26

I have to say, though, that it was not the subject matter of anorexia that turned me off the book. Instead, it was the fact that the novel is simply a muddled mess. When I read a book, I expect at the very least for it to be edited well enough so that I know who's speaking in a dialogue between two or more characters! I didn't find any of the clever and witty writing in Ms. Maxted's sophomore effort that made Getting Over It such a pleasure to read (and no, I wasn't expecting Getting Over It Part II, just another pleasant diversion). And I'm really not expecting that much -- I go into the whole Bridget Jones spinoff genre with my eyes open, expecting the plots to be somewhat formulaic and predictable. Running in Heels was both of those things, but it lacked the insightfulness and wry humor that make the genre such a light little pleasure. If you're looking for books similar to Getting Over It, I'd have to recommend any novel by Marian Keyes over this one, or even one of Lisa Jewell or Jane Green's books.	2002-02-26

As other reviewers have mentioned, I was hesitant at first to tackle a book about the plague. I was so pleasantly surprised upon beginning it, though, that I finished the book in three sittings. Ms. Brooks is a marvelous writer -- her plot and characters are well put together, and the book reads so smoothly it just flies by. I found myself telling others about Year of Wonders, and thinking about it here and there long after I finished. I find that the mark of a good book is how many times it makes me think back and reflect on it, and Year of Wonders is right up there with Corelli's Mandolin in that regard.<br />I won't recount the plot yet again, as amazon and other reviewers have done that admirably, but I will throw a few more compliments Ms. Brooks' way. She does not shy away from the visceral -- the novel feels solid and real, even if sometimes the subect matter turns to somewhat gruesome things. As always with a good historical novel (also see The Dress Lodger by Sheri Holman and The Conspiracy of Papers by David Liss), the read is educational as well as entertaining. I even learned the origin of the phrase \\"still wet behind the ears,\\" though apparently my coworkers were not as excited as I was about the news when I passed it on. In any case, I recommend Year of Wonders very highly -- it has wonderfully unique characters, an interesting plot, and is a surprisingly easy though dense read.	2002-02-20

Throughout the course of Cupid and Diana, we are introduced to Diana's love-hate relationship with her large Catholic family, and follow along as her life changes upon meeting Harry Sandburg, a recently separated lawyer who has just moved to D.C. The novel is predictable in all aspects, but an easy read. Bartolomeo makes some interesting observations about life that make the book shine every now and then, but as whole, it's largely forgettable. A comfortable look at a life of a woman who manages to shake the cloak of inertia off of herself, something that, as we all know, is harder and harder to do as the years pass.	2002-02-15

However, when it comes to the digestion of what's been read, that's a different story altogether. Red Azalea is the story of the author's childhood under China's Cultural Revolution, but tackled with seemingly simple language that manages to impart complicated undercurrents of meaning to the reader. Min has stated in interviews that she admires the painting style of Henri Matisse, and that her writing style is a reflection of that simplicity and naivete.<br />Red Azalea tells Min's story from elementary school where she is a good communist leader right off the bat, to her time spent at a farm where she has a relationship with her supervisor, to being chosen to star in a film version of one of Madame Mao's operas, Red Azalea. I found Min to be inaccessible, and the memoir difficult to ground in reality; however, this did not prevent me from enjoying the book and being vastly educated by it. The tone of the book was almost otherworldly, perhaps because of the lack of everyday details that would somehow anchor the events. I found myself often glancing back at the cover of the book, as if to remind myself that this was indeed nonfiction. Red Azalea is quite different from any book I've ever read: a memoir both complicated and simple, a plot both clear and elusive. Recommended for a challenge where you'd least expect one.	2002-01-27

Between \\"meaningful\\" contemporary fiction, I like to have a go at quick Bridget Jones-type reads. Mr. Maybe definitely fits the bill. The novel features Libby, a 27-year-old career girl who is desperate to no longer be single. The book focuses on her relationships with two men - Nick, whom she fancies but seems like no one that she'd ever consider seriously dating, and Ed, everything she's ever wanted... except for his dull as dirt personality. It's obviously not a stretch to figure out with whom Libby will end up, but it's the getting there that's the fun part. The novel also features a strong cast of supporting characters - Libby's mom is a hoot, and her wise friend Jules always offers good advice. The graphic sex scenes were a little much for me (made me feel like I was reading a Harlequin romance), but other than that, Mr. Maybe was exactly what I expected from Jane Green, having already read Jemima J. A breezy, light read. Also recommended are Marian Keyes and Anna Maxted. Now back to the harder stuff...	2001-12-22

It's a poignant novel, set in the 1950's, chronicling a few months in the life of a teen girl who is desperately trying to find herself in a world which seems to be constantly changing. Tamara's father is a painter, and he moves his wife and three children on a yearly basis in order to find new subject matter for his paintings. The book begins with the family's move to rural New York state, and just as things seem to be settling down for Tamara, her whole life is thrown into turmoil again, from a source she never would have expected.<br />I can't wait to get my hands on another Sarah Willis novel. This one was written with so much wisdom and understanding about the truly important things in life - your family, your relationships with others, your sense of self. Thanks very much to the amazon.com reader who including this gem in their listmania list!	2001-12-10

In the Drink, though, sends somewhat mixed signals. Its heroine is indeed an anti-hero, as some other reviewers have mentioned. She wasn't, however, endearing enought that I cheered for her despite her faults. I wasn't sure what exactly, if anything, Claudia has learned by the novel's end, and how exactly she was going to sort out her life. Still, the writing blew me away at times, and I liked the book well enough to finish it. Kate Christensen is an author with promise.	2001-09-24

She hates her job, doesn't have too many friends, and consoles herself with ravenous eating. Upon taking an internet class for work, her life changes. She makes friends, chats up a good-looking man online, and goes out a few times. Having suddenly realized the possibilities, Jemima joins a gym, works out twice a day, and resorts to subsisting off of hot water with lemon and lettuce. It works -- Jemima is slim and happy by the end of the novel.<br />So that's the book in a nutshell. Reality, however, does not work that way. Women who compulsively overeat do not simply wake up one morning suddenly having developed the desire to work out twice a day and eat alomst nothing. And of those who do lose weight through a long and arduous struggle -- well, not every one of them turns out to be thin _and_ drop-dead gorgeous. I suppose, however, that's why this book is a fairy tale. It's mildly amusing, has an affable cast of characters, and is a quick and easy read that's good for the summer. It seems, however, that the same book could be written without trivializing Jemima's position and without making everything seem so shiny and easy. Good beach read if you don't expect anything but a quick and pleasant read.	2001-08-07

I've read all of Marian Keyes' novels now, and I have to say that this might be her best yet. Watermelon was great, Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married a bit disappointing, Rachel's Holiday mildy depressing and frustrating, but Last Chance Saloon had me hooked. I very much enjoyed the cast of characters, each very well sketched out. The book really is a clever look at how easily one can become complacent, how easy it is to settle or simply float through life. The novel was a perfect mix of having something wortwhile to say about life and being immensely readable -- I oftentimes have the feeling that most books make me choose between substance and pleasure. Tara, Katherine, and Fintan will make you laugh and cry with their lives. Most definitily recommended.	2001-08-07

It's a predictable little treat of a novel, perfect for those who want some relaxing beach reading for the summer but have already read both Bridget Jones installments, perhaps even more than once! I enjoyed the premise of the book -- you follow along the lives of a few people who live in the same building, and they all meet at the end when everything falls together.<br />If you enjoy this genre of chick-lit, I also recommend Marian Keyes, especially Watermelon, her first novel, and Last Chance Saloon, which comes out in the States in August.	2001-07-23

One of the aspects that I've always enjoyed in this mystery series is the attention that the author paid to the lives of the two main characters. In A Traitor to Memory, that seems to have flown by the wayside, and Havers and Lynley are given rather slipshod treatment. The small sections devoted to their private lives seem perfunctory and forced.<br />In addition, I felt that the mystery itself wasn't as strong in this novel. The timeline for one character's novel is not in sync with the other chapters, which I found to be quite confusing when I realized what was going on. The ending comes out of nowhere and leaves many questions unanswered, which, in itself isn't a crime, but these questions needed to be answered in order for the book to make sense.<br />Overall though, A Traitor to Memory kept me glued to its pages. Regardless of the book's weaknesses, Ms. George is a fantastic British mystery writer. I look forward to her next book, hoping that she'll take time and care with it, and especially to the BBC adaptation of the first book in her series, to appear on PBS some time in early 2002.	2001-07-14

Addy Abraham is a sick little girl, driven to hallucinations and fits by the neglect and selfishness of her alcoholic father and simpering debutant of a mother. Her grip on sanity is strengthened by the arrival of Lou, her Caribbean nanny. Now that Lou has died, Addy as an adult travels to St. Clair, still unwell, to face the ghosts of her past. Ms. Styron has written the book by alternating chapters of the adult and child Addy, which works well and is easy to follow.<br />All the Finest Girls is a disheartening book, the story of a sad and lonely little girl whose parents have forgotten the cardinal rule of parenthood -- the parents are no longer the focus of attention. I did not find Addy to be a particularly likeable character, though; she managed to somewhat annoy and bore me at the same time. It was the supporting cast that realy shined in the novel, and I look forward to hearing more from Alexandra Styron. Also recommended along these lines is Bee Season by Myla Goldberg -- if you liked this one, you should give it a try.	2001-07-10

It centers around the budding relationship of two people who just can't seem to get it right.

The book did indeed remind me quite a bit of The Stone Diaries, and also Drowning Ruth (both great reads, by the way). It's got that whole mid-20th century rural thing happening. The story follows the life of Augusta Olsen, now aging with a weak hip, through a series of flashbacks. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the flashbacks too difficult to follow, although I do agree that after a while, all of Augusta's visions and sightings on one day in the present that triggered all the memories got just a little too formulaic and convenient. The novel doesn't have anything too pretty to say about growing old, either. Nevertheless, I found A Recipe for Bees to be interesting and well-written. The theme of bee-keeping was well-woven into the plot, and nicely framed the themes of marriage, children, and infidelity. Gail Anderson-Dargatz is a talented writer and I look forward to reading more from her.	2001-05-31

I would advise against treating the book like a how-to manual aimed at single motherhood. It's not particularly believable, nor did I relate to Ellen, the protagonist, except in the most general &quot;I want to have a baby someday and boy won't it look cute dressed up in little big people clothes&quot; sort of way. I can understand the consternation a single mother might feel upon reading the book, as it's not a realistic depiction of single motherhood. Having said that, however, I still enjoyed the book. As Animal Husbandry, which was great, this is a humorous novel full of fun characters and quick plot and dialogue. My recommendation for Dating Big Bird, as for many of the other books I review, is to not take it so seriously. It seems, oftentimes, that people expect much more from a book than what the author might have intended to provide. So read Dating Big Bird, laugh and enjoy, but don't expect philosophical musings on the meaning of life.	2001-05-21

Not because I had had particularly high expectations of the novel, because I hadn't. I was disappointed simply because I felt that Girl Talk COULD have been great. It had all the right elements -- interesting characters, an intriguing plot. But for whatever reason, people involved in the book's publication obviously didn't do their jobs as well as they should have.<br />First of all, and I know that this is a minor gripe, there are a few words of Polish sprinkled throughout the novel. Great, I think, throwing those in there will make the grandmother seem more real, better fleshed out. The problem, however, is that I speak Polish, and the few words thrown into the book were, well, NOT. Almost every Polish word in the book was misspelt, and strange accents were thrown in where they didn't belong. But ok, I know very few people are going to notice that. However, there were a few more editing gaffes. For example, there is a character in the book with a prosthetic leg. Lissy uses the exact same metaphor to describe the book twice in the novel -- it's like a lover waiting for her. I'm almost certain that the author did not mean to repeat herself -- she simply had the same good idea twice and no one caught it.<br />So. I'll most likely read Ms. Baggott's next attempt, if only to see if she lives up to her promise. As for this book, it's largely skip-able. I'd recommend Amy and Isbaelle for a mother-daughter book, or My Year of Meats perhaps.	2001-05-18

As Szpilman's son writes in the preface to the book, his father was not a writer, and the memoir is a testament to that fact. There is no overly flowerly language, no planned-out metaphors. The Pianist is simply a factual account of the mirculous events which lead to Wladyslaw Szpilman surviving first the Warsaw ghetto and later hiding out in Warsaw for years until the war ended. I learned quite a bit about life in the ghetto by reading the book, and found it interesting that Szpilman did not write with rage or hatred towards those who made his life a living hell for so many years. The memoir is, in a way, an exercise in fate -- there were so many opportunities when Szpilman could have died, could have been discovered, could have been sent to Treblinka, that it seems that his survival was written in the stars. The Pianist is a short memoir, a quick read, and very much recommended to anyone who is interested in the Holocaust or World War II. Roman Polanski was just in Poland shooting the movie version, and I'm interested to see how that turns out.	2001-05-09

It is, however, somewhat bizarre, and that's why I did not give it the full five stars. I'm not one who demands that everything be spelled out for me clearly when I'm reading, but there were times as I was reading The Blue Bedspread that I was just plain confused. I wouldn't have minded the confusion if the author had cleared it up later, but he never did.<br />But enough about that. The book is a fast read, easily read in one sitting. The plot is held together by a middle aged bachelor who retrieves his newly orphaned niece from the hospital, her mother -- his sister -- having died while giving birth. During the night that follows, the man writes down a collection of stories for the baby so that she can read them when she's older and know who she is and where she came from. The stories are written from different points of view, with no proper names given to anyone, and focus mainly on the childhood of the boy and his sister.<br />I see that the reviews are quite mixed. People either loved the prose or hated the book because of it's unorthodox style and saddenning subject matter. Reader, it's up to you. If you don't mind a challenge, give the book a try. If you like things pretty cut and dry, this book isn't for you.	2001-05-08
US	52917715	RND4MS779RWMP	0743201647	529957238	The Pleasing Hour	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A window into human relationships	I very much enjoyed reading The Pleasing Hour -- I'm actually quite surprised that Oprah hasn't chosen it for her book club. It's very much her type of book -- summer reading with a kick. The novel centers around a young American girl who literally runs away to Paris and becomes an au pair for a rather interesting family there. The Pleasing Hour deals not only with Rosie, the au pair, but delves into the characters of the entire Tivot family -- the distant and cold mother, the scattered father who longs for human affection, the confused older sister, the brassy younger sister, and the brother, coddled by his mother and longing to become a priest. The book is somewhat of an insight into French culture, but Lily King is no Peter Mayle. It's the characters and the relationships among them that make The Pleasing Hour shine. The reader learns the cause of Rosie's pain quite early on in the book, and in a way, she's merely a window through which the reader is able to get a glimpse of the Tivot family. An intriguing and well-written debut novel -- I look forward to reading more by Ms. King.	2001-05-02

Though the &quot;meat&quot; side of the novel was impossible to miss -- it is, obviously, crucial to the plot -- I found that it had very little to do with what made the book so enjoyable. I'd seen the book around in bookstores for years, but never bought it because I thought that I had the meat industry covered, having read Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. Don't make the same mistake I made! My Year of Meats is SO much more. Jane Takagi-Little is a documentarian who accepts an offer to make a series of half-hour shows for Japanese television entitled &quot;My American Wife!&quot; and sponsored by the American beef industry. She takes the opportunity to do more than simply showcase beef, repeatedly breaking orders from Japan and filming the most unusual and intriguing &quot;American Wives&quot; she can find -- a couple in Louisiana who have adopted Asian children, and even vegeterian lesbians! In the process, Jane learns a lot about the beef industry, and begins to plan to subversively expose the shocking details meat-eaters would rather not know. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find this part of the novel to be excessively preachy; it fit in with the plot nicely. Along the way, the reader also learns about Jane's private life and what makes her tick, fleshing out her character nicely.<br />On the other side of the globe we have Akiko Ueno, the wife of one of Jane's bosses. Through her eyes the reader is able to learn much about the Japanese culture. Akiko is abused by her husband, who she was set up with by her boss and married out of obedience. Eventually the lives of Jane and Akiko intertwine with fascinating end to the novel. Set to exquisite sections of The Pillow Book, My Year of Meats is a captivating read.	2001-05-02

I had read Marian Keyes' two previous books, and liked them well enough to buy this one. I was pleasantly surprised! Rachel's Holiday features Rachel Walsh, sister of Claire, the heroine of Watermelon, Marian Keyes' first novel (and in my opinion, best). She's hustled back to Dublin by her family after she takes an almost fatal overdose of drugs when she's living in New York City. The book is a painful look at how debilitating drug addiction can be, and focuses on the incredibally strong stance of denial that Rachel takes when she first enters the treatment center. The novel follows her through her weeks there, and Keyes does a geat job of describing all of the eccentric characters that Rachel meets at The Cloisters, her drug rehab center. The book also follows Rachel after she is released from The Cloisters and is faced with the challenges of reality once again. Rachel's Holiday is not as laugh-out-loud funny as Watermelon nor as silly as Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, but it's a nice, relaxing read nonetheless.	2001-04-30

The two protagonists of the book are likable and well-developed. There's the young Chilean woman, Eliza, who flees her adoptive home for California to follow her first love, who has been lured there by the promises of riches in the Gold Rush. Then there's Tao Chi'en, a Chinese man who is part sailor, part doctor, and part sage. The adventures of the two up and down the California coast make for an enjoyable read, and the secondary characters give the novel some meat for its bones -- Eliza's adoptive mother Miss Rose, Joe Bonecrusher -- the cross-dressing madam of a traveling brothel, and Paulina -- the wife with business savvy who makes a fortune importing fresh produce packed on ice to California's starved population, all make for an intriguing read. Allende uses the juxtaposition of the Chinese, Chilean, and English cultures to unobtrusively remark on issues such as a woman's position in the world, and the theme of identity weighs in heavily. Fortune in this case can either be interpreted as fate or simply luck, but in either case, the characters seem to be unable to escape it for better or worse. Good summer reading -- a step up from mass market paperback fodder, but not too heavy and cumbersome.	2001-04-23

Roy's writing is ephemeral; reality is gossamer-fine and the reader is never quite sure where he or she might be treading. What kept me hooked, though, was the absolutely marvelous writing. Even if I were given an infinity to think, I don't believe I could come up with such beautiful phrasings. I would agree with other reviewers in saying that this book is not for everyone. If you like the concrete, stated plainly, then chances are this novel is not for you. If you like only books that on topics familiar to you, then I wouldn't recommend it. If, however, you're a sucker for remarkable prose and don't mind being a little confused at times when you're reading, then give Arundhati Roy a try.	2001-04-10

It was well paced and clever; the characters were sketched out well, though not particularly likeable. The plot centers around a small college in rural Vermont (how's that for redundant...). There, a washed out professor/writer, similar to the main character in Chabon's Wonder Boys, finds new life in the form of a raggedy sophomore in his writing workshop. The girl, Angela, makes quite the impact on the professor by the end of the novel (don't want to give anything away), and the reader is left second-guessing his or her own assumptions about the novel's characters. It's a quick read, it makes you think, but I was a little turned off by the professor's neurotic ramblings. Overall recommended.	2001-04-05

I came across Sheri Holman's novel on the &quot;paperback favorites&quot; table when I was browsing in a local bookstore. It looked intriguing, so I thought that I'd give it a try. The book is about a 19th century cholera epidemic in an English town, and features Gustine, a poor girl with a very ill child who works as a potter's assistant by day and a prostitute by night -- she is provided with a fancy blue dress to attract higher-end clientele (hence the title). Also featured is Henry Chivers, a young doctor who is trying to escape a grisly past. It's really the secondary characters that make the book though -- Eye, the old woman who follows Gustine around to make sure she doesn't abscond with the dress; Pink, the daughter of Gustine's conspiracy-theory crazed landlord who is desperate for a little love; and Mike, the landlord's prize ferret, treasured above all, and much above Pink.<br />The novel is not a cheery one; death lurks around every corner and loathesome characters abound. Even each of the main characters is deeply flawed in some way, and the reader is left without anyone to truly cheer for. Dr. Chivers, especially, is hardly the hero the reader might have initially expected him to be. Holman employs an interesting technique to tidly wrap up the plot, leaving open the possiblity that it _doesn't_ get tidly wrapped up. She is a gifted writer; the novel is darkly humorous at times, and very well researched. Also recommended is The Conspiracy of Paper by David Liss, which I've also read and reviewed on amazon.	2001-04-01

We have Aaron, the older brother, who is consistently bullied at school and feels at peace only at the Jewish temple where his father, Saul, is the cantor. Saul has created a world for himself in his tiny study full of books from which her emerges only to cook dinner for the family as his wife, Miriam, is not the domestic type. Miriam, meanwhile, is haunted by her quest to reach Perfectimundo, a state in which everything is perfectly clean, sterile, and in its correct place. And then there's Eliza, who is tracked as a lower-achieving student in second grade and manages to float through life on a cload of after-school sitcoms, achieiving nothing out of the ordinary until she rockets to the national spelling bee in fifth grade. What follows is the family's gradual collapse, helped along by Aaron's decision to find God in the Hare Krishna faith, Miriam's schitzophrenic kleptomania, and Saul's newlyfound belief that his daughter can be trained to become a direct link to God based on her talents with letters. Eliza, thrilled at the prospect of her father finally noticed her, plays along until the bitter end when everything snaps. Bee Season is gutwrenching and by its end, makes the reader feel like he might have descended into the darkness that this family inhabits. Goldberg is a gifted writer, and I look forward to reading more of her work, if perhaps of a more optimistic slant.	2001-03-14

I just finished this book today, and must say that I'm overwhelmed by the experience. Corelli's Mandolin was selected by a book club that I'm in; I don't think that I would have read it otherwise because books and movies about wartime tend to sadden me too much. As did this one, but it was well worth it. I've seen many synopses that paint the novel as a story of a woman torn between two men, and that's not really accurate at all. The book is so much more broad than that, and Pelagia, the book's heroine, never actually debates which man to &quot;choose.&quot;<br />I learned so much about the history of Greece by reading Corelli's Mandolin; it really is a historical novel. De Bernieres paints the atrocities of war so clearly that there were a few passages in the book where, I must admit, I cried. Hard. Very few books are able to illicit that sort of emotion from me, but this one definitely did me in. The writing is phenomenal; De Bernieres has a true gift of creating pictures for his readers with his words. Each character is finely chiseled out, clear and immensely memorable. I'm planning to recommend this one to everyone that I know; I read constantly, but I have a feeling it's going to be a while before I come across another book so intense. Very highly recommended.	2001-03-11

I bought the book many moons ago, long before Oprah graced it with her ubiquitous sticker, and I started it twice without getting further than the first few chapters. I've talked to other readers since then, and the general consensus seems to be that the novel is indeed hard to begin. I did read it in its entirety on my third try, and am glad that I did. The story of the 4 daughters and mother who had Africa forced upon them by a missionary zealot father was a very interesting read, and I learned quite a bit about the political history of the Congo. The book is long, however, and the characters quite complex. It's definitely one that you'll keep turning over in your mind after completing it. The novel is written in chapters that are narrated by the five females in the family, and each of them has a very distinct voice, a tribute to Kingsolver's writing abilities. On the down note, I and many others in a book discussion I attended seemed to find Kingsolver a bit preachy in the later half of the book. The first half is definitely the highlight, when the girls are young and they live in the tiny village where their father, severely damaged by WWII, attempts to convert the inhabitants into Southern Baptists. Overall, the book is somewhat of a challenge to read, but rewarding. A recommendation, especially if you have someone to discuss it with after you've finished.	2001-03-01

Well, I think I might have reached capacity in the single gal in London lamenting over her family/body/job/lack of boyfriend genre. If you take a look at the other books I've reviewed, you'll see that I've been around the block with the likes of Marian Keyes, Isabel Wolff, Helen Fielding, and scads of other writers who want to cash in on the next Bridget Jones. Getting Over It, like many of its kin, is a relaxing, enjoyable read. Ms. Maxted is witty, and she tells an engrossing yarn. But, this can't hide the fact that the plot is ultimately yawningly predictable and the characters are more caricatures than representations of real, fleshed-out people. BUT WAIT! I _did_ like the book. I would simply warn readers to be sure that they know what they're getting into. It's not great literature; you won't sit around mulling over its moral implications for hours. It's a fun little story about a 20-something gal whose father dies, mom goes temporarily nuts, roommate kicks her out, cat pees in her underwear drawer, and friend is a victim of domestic abuse. And then there's the obligatory love interest who waxes and wanes throughout the course of the novel. Good fun, but I think my next choice will be a bit more substantial.	2001-02-19

I suppose that I should start off by saying that Gary Gilmore was put to death before I was born, and I've never read or seen The Executioner's Song, so this was a completely new topic to me. I picked the books up at a used book store because I'm a big fan of the memoir. Now that I've finished, I'm a little stunned. The life that Mikal describes as his childhood and adolescence, and especially that of his significantly older brothers, seems like a nightmarish fairy tale to me. Growing up, I never realized how lucky I was to have a stable family life, where no one drank, beat, left, or was just plain crazy. Interestingly enough, Mikal paints his father as the main culprit behind the unhinging of the family, but it occurs to me that his mother was just as bad. Overall, the book is a thoroughly depressing tale, a house of horrors that the characters just can't seem to escape. I found Mikal's writing style to be a little stilted, a little forced. An interesting memoir, but not at the top of my list. I recommend All Over But the Shoutin' by Rick Bragg and The Liar's Club by Mary Karr for anyone interested in the &quot;Southern Gothic&quot; genre.	2001-02-06

I read The Hero and the Crown first, knowing that it was written after The Blue Sword, but chronologically first. Having done so, I don't have much advice -- I'm not sure if I did it the right way or not -- this is a similar dilemma as that of reading the Narnia Chronicles (do you read them chronologically or in the order they were written?). Perhaps, ideally, you would do both. In any case, I enjoyed The Blue Sword immensely, but definitely feel that The Hero and the Crown is a better book. The characters seem more solid, the plot is more mature. Regardless, both of these books should be a must on any y.a. fantasy reader's list. Also recommended are Lloyd Alexander, Madeline L'Engle, and Sabriel by Garth Nix. What a way to stay young at heart!	2001-02-05

The books are quite similar: young girl in the south growing up in poverty with an abusive/drunk father and an oddly artistic/educated mother who doesn't quite fit the picture. Unlike Karr's poetic lyricism, though, Moss sticks to the facts. She describes her childhood growing up dirt poor in rural Alabama with her 7 brothers and sisters in excritiating detail, recollecting the days when her alcoholic father drank away all the money and there was nothing to eat in the house. Nothing. The book has a very odd chronological sequence -- Moss jumps to and fro from childhood to adulthood to somewhere in between from page to page. Her hatred and wild love for her parents is fasinating and infuriating both -- one simply cannot believe that people live in such a way and survive. Perhaps not as beautifully told as others, and leaving many gaps, but a riveting tale nonetheless.	2001-01-25

However, I'm a bit puzzled that so many reviewers have neglected to bring up the fact that Charlie is ill. Sure, he has all the normal teenage doubts and yearnings, but they're multiplied by the fact that he's not mentally stable. I don't want to give any of the book away, but I will say that throughout the letters to his friend, Charlie reveals more and more disturbing information about his background. So, although this IS quite a good book, and, as many have said, comparable to A Catcher in the Rye, I would warn readers to keep at the back of their minds that Charlie is not your average 15 year old boy. Having said that, I praise Mr. Chbosky for writing a book that's so true and raw, a book that all adolescents and anyone who's ever been an adolescent can relate to. A poignant read.	2001-01-11

Written in the first person, the novel explores the relationships that Sally, the protagonist, has with her mother, sister, grandmother, aunt and uncle, and of course, father. The portions of the book dealing with Sally's mental illness are very real, quite frightening, in fact. For some reason, the detail that Sally's handwriting became illegible as she slipped closer and closer to becoming completely unhinged really stuck with me. The relationships that Sally has with her family members are quite complex, as those things tend to be, I suppose, and the end of the novel offers no resolution, so I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone who likes their ending nicely packaged. This is one of those books, I think, that affects its reader in slight, sneaky ways. Little bits come floating back to you now and then as you make your own way through life. As with any book that deals with difficult topics, it's not as easy to write a review. It wasn't a joyous read, or a &quot;satisfying&quot; one, per se, but compelling and well-crafted.	2001-01-07

Otherwise Engaged is the story of Eve, the narrator, teetering on the brink of lunacy as the months of her year-long engagement fly by and her wedding looms closer and closer. Though I couldn't really relate to the Valium-popping, therapist-going stress-bomb that Eve becomes, I still thoroughly enjoyed Suzanne Finnamore's writing. It's very stream of consciousness, very funny, very real. Here's an example: &quot;This morning, the traffic manager blindsides me in the elevator. She is feral. If I squint just a little, she is a starved wolverine. She snarls and frets and talks about how we need final three-quarter-inch tape by the first. I am afraid and want to kill her with a stick.&quot; When I read this passage in bed, I laughed so loud that I woke up my boyfriend. Many of the subplots of the novel are quite interesting, such as Eve's difficulties at work and the illness of a close friend. A recommended read for anyone, whether you're married, thinking about it, or not even close.	2001-01-03

It's obvious that the book is based on a character that Wolff created for a newspaper column -- it's plastered together in month by month chapters, but there's really very little continuity to it. I couldn't really get a good handle on Tiffany -- is she ditzy? intellectual? funny? dull? hopeless? self-sufficient? The novel is humorous, though, and a very fast read. I must say, though, that if you're looking to read a selection from the exponentially multiplying &quot;neurotic London gal desperately searching for a husband/job/weight loss&quot; genre, there are some better choices out there. Making Minty Malone, by the same author, was a fun read, as was Watermelon by Marian Keyes.	2000-12-19

I found out about Sabriel on amazon -- it was listed on many people's favorites lists. What a find! I finished the book in one sitting, completely entranced. Mr. Nix's imagination shines in the pages of Sabriel. While the basis of the plot is farly standard -- young orphan-like girl has adventures, finds strength she didn't know she had, experiences love -- it's the details that really stand out. The story of the Abhorsen, in particular, is fascinating. I don't, however, give the book 5 stars because it left a few loose ends here and there, and could have used a tad more editing. It's a fun read, though, recommended for anyone who enjoys Robin McKinley, Lloyd Alexander, Philip Pullman, and C.S. Lewis.	2000-12-19

Unfortunately, I didn't find Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married nearly as entertaining as Watermelon. The protagonist wasn't as sympathetic; I didn't feel chummy with Lucy like I did I had with Claire. Perhaps it's because I don't have much in common with Lucy -- she went to secretarial school and works as a temp at an office where everyone moans and complains but never does any work -- turning on the computer before noon is considered an accomplishment. Lucy and her roommates spend the majority of their time drunk with all sort of unsuitable men in their beds with them. Yuck. Lucy makes fun of her roommate Charlotte for being &quot;slow,&quot; but truth be told, I didn't think Lucy was the sharpest tool in the shed herself. The novel was funny and lighthearted, and somewhat entertaining, but in the whole &quot;Bridget Jones/young British gals living life&quot; genre, I've read much better.	2000-12-15

They are slices cut out of life, full of humor, love, and sometimes a little pain. Making Minty Malone is one of these slices, often compared to Bridget Jones' Diary, the most famous of the popular &quot;single gal in London dealing with men, family, and life in general in a stream of consciousness way&quot; genre. You won't find any finely wrought similies, you won't find philosophical musings on the meaning of life. But that's ok. Making Minty Malone is a fun read, full of clever characters and interesting plot turns. It is one of those books that's difficult to put down, one of those books where you feel chummy with the characters. I also recommend Marian Keyes if you liked this one, and a more obscure title, Run, Catch, Kiss. An enjoyable gal read.	2000-12-13

I wonder how I missed this one when it was first published; I would have been at the right age to be interested. In any case, I've made up for the ommission now, and I suggest that others do the same, if the omission is indeed there. The book is not as epic in scope as, for example, Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy, and the protagonist perhaps not as memorable as others, but the children's fantasy genre is quite competitive! I also found the writing to be a bit odd at times -- interspersed here and there are sentences that just plain don't make sense. Overlooking those provisos, though, I do give the book 4 stars. Ms. McKinley does a solid job of introducing her readers to the land of Damar, of providing plenty of action. A good selection for any fantasy fan, though not groundbreaking.	2000-12-11

All of the characters were very well developed, and the plot moved along quickly with surprises around many a corner.

I'm not going to go into details here and pick the novel apart, but there are a few general notes that I'd like to make for those wondering whether or not to read the series in the first place. Obviously, given my five star rating, I think that you should READ IT. A few provisos, though, especially for parents wondering if this is appropriate for their kids. If you're the type of person who thinks that Harry Potter should be banned because the books promote witchcraft, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If, however, you're a freethinking soul who isn't afraid of letting your kids do their own thinking, then by all means, BUY. Pullman's book is wonderfully imaginative, full of magical lands and creatures. It's very thematically adult, though, and weighs heavily on the heart and mind. If you're a fan of fantasy, if you enjoy LLoyd Alexander or C.S. Lewis, then you're in for a treat. A recommended read for both adults and children.	2000-12-06

Waiting is a no frills novel that cuts through the extras of life and gets right to the brunt of the problem, which, in this case, is the &quot;love affair&quot; between an army doctor and nurse in communist China. The characters are all wonderfully developed, though not particularly as people that you'd want to spend heaps of time with yourself. It's not a novel, though, that leaves the reader with a sense of satisfaction when he or she has finished it. Perhaps it's because Ha Jin tells his story about the senselessness of life but doesn't offer any convenient salvation for Lin and Manna, the two &quot;lovers.&quot; And though I know that sometimes life goes that way, people are disappointed, frustrated, and unhappy, I guess that in a way I read books to get away from all that. Still, Waiting is well written and gives you a periferal insight into Chinese society, but it's most certainly neither a relaxing nor joyous read.	2000-12-01

Younger kids will enjoy the straighforward text that mirrors their own lives. Parents will snicker at the dry wit of the writing, especially when paired with the deadpan drawings. Skip this one if you prefer kid's books with enormous amounts of color, if you like drawings to be larger than life. Olivia's very unassuming. A perfect little pig.	2000-11-27

I read about the highly anticipated Amber Spyglass some months ago so I though that I'd start at the beginning, and am I ever glad that I did. Pullman is incredibly inventive, and does an amazing job of pulling the reader into the many worlds of the trilogy. I highly encourage both younger readers (but not too young; some of the subject matter is quite heavy) and older readers alike to journey to the land of daemons. I wouldn't recommend the book to folks who aren't openminded or are easily offended by religious commentary. A wonderful Christmas gift for those who have already devoured all of the Harry Potters and might have whet their appetite for something a little bit more serious, for seasoned fantasy fans (if you liked C.S. Lewis and Lloyd Alexander growing up, you're in for a treat) and novices alike.	2000-11-27

Mary Karr is still an enormously gifted writer, but while The Liar's Club had it moments of joy interspersed with various traumas, Cherry is just plain dank. Mary's exploits as a child weren't hopeless -- she had a resiliancy about her that assured the reader that she'd be all right, or some version thereof, in the end. The adolescent Mary descends deeper and deeper into a darkness that she manufactures for herself with the help of a pharmacy's worth of drugs and a heapin' helping of teen angst thrown in for good measure. I found it extremely interesting that Karr resorted to telling her story in second person in the last part, in which her relationship with drugs begins. I wondered to myself as I was reading whether she was using the second person narrative as a way of distancing herself from her high school self. In any case, the book is a much more difficult read than The Liar's Club, and I would definitely recommend that book before dipping your toes into this one. The reader emerges thoroughly saddened by Karr's own outright and between-the-lines admissions of her mistakes. I found her relationships with people especially dismaying -- but perhaps that was simply the way she chose to tell the story. The adolescent Karr is far from the precocious child of The Liar's Club. Her story is told from the bottom of an abyss -- I read an interview with Karr where she said that while writing Cherry, she would write for an hour and a half and then just collapse on the floor and fall asleep from exhaustion. I don't doubt it. A difficult yet rewarding book.	2000-11-20

It's really her wonderful drawings that make the book. Couric's verse is heavy; it plods along and occasionally trips. Poor Katie -- no one told her that there's two tricks to writing in verse. She got the rhyming down (sort of), but her meter is terribly off. Like other reviewers have said, though, the message of the book is a good one. We shouldn't taunt and tease those who are unknown and different from us. I applaud Couric's desire to make the world a better place -- her perky demeanor certainly makes my mornings less foul -- but I think that she might have been better off setting up a fellowship for talented children's book writers than attempting a go on her own. Fame and good intentions make talent not.	2000-11-20
US	52917715	R2OWRMEPBSKAFR	0380796090	962133592	Watermelon	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Who knew books could talk!	I picked this puppy up at the Goodwill Book Fair (an event not to be missed for folks who like their dirt-cheap books) last weekend. The cover was pure cheese, but I'm a sucker for anything that has been granted a favorable nod from the NYT Book Review, so I decided to splurge and pay the 90 cents to get it. What a find! Marian Keyes is a gifted writer -- not in any academic high-falutin' sort of way -- but in a way that you'd like your best friend to talk. She's hilarious, and her descriptions of the misadventures of the muddled Claire had me laughing out loud. Ms. Keyes has a way of writing about life that makes the reader exclaim, &quot;That's exactly it!&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed the novel, though I have to agree with another reviewer that Claire's dealings with James at the end of the book were the weakest parts. Perhaps a little more than the cursory glance at their relationship at the onset of the novel would have helped that out a bit. Overall, a pleasurable and humorous read, full of clever insights.	2000-11-17

I figured that if I was going to read it, I should start at the beginning. I should make a note here that I'm a sucker for the memoir rage that's been sweeping bookstores nationwide -- there's just something ultimately satisfying about reading a book of life as opposed to a book of events. Karr met my expectations with a one-two suckerpunch. The Liar's Club is extraordinarily well written; I love Karr's colloquialisms, her mother's foul rantings, her sister's calm instructions. The book is a testament to the age-old adage that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Karr's childhood is spent on the brink of lunacy with her brilliant yet completely f-ed up mother, her heartbroken father, and her sneaky, loony grandmother. Karr's memoir is the stuff of raw human emotions -- lust, hatred, despair, and longing. The book is marinated by the booze the characters drink and then seasoned by the plentiful &quot;horking&quot; that occurs on every other page. A wonderful book.	2000-11-15

These folks, of course, leave disappointed; the movie is funny and has great action sequences, but it's not much more. Similarly, Drowning Ruth is a well-written novel replete with well developed characters. But it's not a period piece nor is it a mystery. Those who wish to gain insight into early 20th century America will be disappointed, those who are looking for a suspensful thriller will be disappointed. C'mon. It's an Oprah book. And that means one thing -- it's going to be about feeeeeelings. It's one of Oprah's better selections, though. I found the characters to be engaging and the relationships between them real and accessible. The novel was well-paced and thoughtful -- an enjoyable read.	2000-11-15

If you think about it, there's not really much that you can object to -- the flaky characters are likable, the plot is helped along by various humorous/embarassing/poignant incidents, and the writing is quite good. Lipman's books are well-packaged reflections of real life, suitable for a bit of entertainment and escapism. After all, it's much more fun to read about the dating woes of someone else than to dwell on your own. The Way Men Act falls into this category as well. It's a fun book, full of quick-paced dialogue, interesting characters, and humorous observations.	2000-11-15

Steve Martin is no dummy -- the book includes many clever and well put phrases, and zips along at a nice clip. There were, however, a few elements which prevented me from giving the book any more than three stars. First of all, there's very little dialogue, but that's just a personal preference of mine. Secondly, and most importantly, I felt that Mr. Martin did not succeed in fleshing out Mirabelle's character in a consistant way. I don't desire predictable characters, of course, but Mirabelle, I think, surpassed being a &quot;mystery&quot; and ended up at just plain improbable. My last gripe, also minor, regards Mr. Martin's propensity to toss in a random profanity here and there. This complaint does not stem from any prudishness on my part -- the words were simply jarring and not at all in line with the subtelty which was a large component of both protagonists' characters. Overall, a pleasurable read, but ultimately not memorable.	2000-11-14

I couldn't make the connection between the rave reviews on the dust jacket and the writing within. Since the book is loosely a mystery, I wasn't able to toss it aside -- naturally, I wanted to know what happened to Christopher's parents. In the meantime, though, my reading was peppered with exclamations of disbelief and disgust as I forged my way through the book. I never did decide whether the tepid writing and unnecessarily obtuse timeline were more frustrating, or whether it was the ridiculous behavior of the narrator, whose decision-making abilities bordered those of a squirrel. I found the ending to be trite, and many of the characters hollow. Overall, not a positive impression of my first Ishiguro.	2000-11-13
